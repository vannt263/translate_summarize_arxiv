    "the proper euclidean geometry studies mutual dispositions of geometrical objects ( figures ) in the space ( in the set @xmath5 of points ) . any geometrical object @xmath6 is a subset @xmath7 of points . relations between different objects are relations of equivalence , when two different objects @xmath8 and @xmath9 are considered to be equivalent @xmath10 .",
    "the geometrical object @xmath8 is considered to be equivalent to the geometrical object @xmath9 , if after corresponding displacement the geometrical object @xmath8 coincides with the geometrical object @xmath9 .",
    "the geometrical object is considered to be constructed of basic elements ( blocks ) .",
    "there are at least three representations of euclidean geometry , which differ in the number and the choice of basic elements ( primary concepts ) .",
    "the first representation ( euclidean representation , or e - representation ) of the euclidean geometry was obtained by euclid many years ago .",
    "the basic elements in the e - representation are point , segment and angle .",
    "the segment is a segment of the straight line .",
    "it consists of infinite number of points .",
    "the segment is determined uniquely by its end points .",
    "the angle is a figure , formed by two segments provided the end of one segment coincides with the end of other one .",
    "properties of basic elements are described by a system of axioms .",
    "any geometrical object may be considered to be some composition of blocks ( _ point , segment , angle _ ) .",
    "the number of blocks may be infinite .",
    "the segments determine distances .",
    "the angles determine the mutual orientation of segments .",
    "comparison of different geometrical objects ( figures ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 is produced by their displacement and superposition .",
    "if two figures coincide at superposition , they are considered to be equivalent ( equal ) .",
    "the process of displacement in itself is not formalized in e - representation .",
    "however , the law of the geometric objects displacement is used at the formulation of the euclidean geometry propositions and at their proofs .",
    "the second representation ( vector representation , or v - representation ) of the euclidean geometry contains two basic elements ( _ point , vector _ ) . from the viewpoint of e - representation",
    "the vector is a directed segment of straight , determined by two points .",
    "one point is the origin of the vector , another point is the end of the vector .",
    "but such a definition of vector takes place only in e - representation , where the vector is a secondary ( derivative ) concept . in v - representation",
    "the vector is defined axiomatically as an element of a linear vector space , where two operations under vectors are defined .",
    "these operations ( addition of two vectors and multiplication of a vector by a real number ) formalize the law of displacement of vectors . strictly , these operations are simply some formal operations in the linear vector space .",
    "they begin describe the law of displacement only after introduction of the scalar product of vectors in the vector space .",
    "after introduction of the scalar product the linear vector space becomes to be the euclidean space , and the abstract vector may be considered as a directed segment of straight , determined by two points .",
    "however , it is only interpretation of a vector in the euclidean representation . in the v - representation the vector as a primary object .",
    "it is an element of the linear vector space .",
    "nevertheless interpretation of a vector as a directed segment of straight is very important at construction of geometrical objects ( figures ) from points and vectors .",
    "the e - representation contains three basic elements : _ point , segment _ and _ angle_. the v - representation contains only two basic elements : _ point _ and _ vector_. the angle of the e - representation is replaced by the linear vector space , which is a structure , describing interrelation of two vectors ( directed segments ) .",
    "the vector has some properties as an element of the linear vector space .",
    "any geometrical figure may be constructed of points and vectors .",
    "it means that the method of construction of any figure may be described in terms of points and vectors .",
    "the properties of a vector as an element of the linear vector space admit one to describe properties of displacement of figures and their compositions .    in v - representation",
    "the angle appears to be an derivative element .",
    "it is determined by two vectors ( by their lengths and by the scalar product between these vectors ) . in the v - representation",
    "the angle @xmath11 between two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath12 is defined by the relation @xmath13where @xmath14 is the scalar product of vectors @xmath4 and @xmath12 .",
    "the quantities @xmath15and @xmath16 are their lengths@xmath17    thus , transition from the e - representation with three basic elements to the v - representation with two basic elements is possible , provided the properties of one basic element ( vector ) are determined by the fact , that the vector is an element of the linear vector space with the scalar product , given on it .",
    "is it possible a further reduction of the number of basic elements in the representation of the euclidean geometry ?",
    "yes , it is possible .",
    "the representation ( in terms world function , or @xmath0-representation ) of the euclidean geometry may contain only one basic element ( point ) , provided there are some constraints , imposed on any two points of the euclidean space .",
    "the transition from the e - representation to the v - representation reduces the number of basic elements .",
    "simultaneously this transition generates a new structure ( linear vector space ) , which determine properties of new basic element ( vector ) .",
    "the transition from the v - representation to @xmath0-representation also reduces the number of basic elements . only one basic element ( _ point _ ) remains .",
    "simultaneously this transition replaces the linear vector space by a new two - point structure ( _ world function _ ) , which describes interrelation of two points instead of a vector .",
    "the world function @xmath0 is defined by the relation @xmath18the world function @xmath0 is connected with the distance @xmath2 by the relation@xmath19the world function of the proper euclidean space is constrained by a series of restrictions ( see below ) .",
    "existence of the @xmath0-representation , containing only one basic element , means that all geometrical objects and all relations between them may be recalculated to the @xmath0-representation , i.e. expressed in terms of the world function and only in terms of the world function .",
    "if we want to construct a generalized geometry , we are to modify properties of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "it means that we are to modify properties of basic elements of the proper euclidean geometry . in the e - representation",
    "we have three basic elements ( _ point , segment , angle _ ) .",
    "their properties are connected , because finally the segment and the angle are simply sets of points .",
    "modification the three basic elements can not be independent .",
    "it is very difficult to preserve connection between the modified basic elements of a generalized geometry .",
    "nobody does modify the proper euclidean geometry in the e - representation .",
    "in v - representation there are two basic elements of geometry ( _ point , vector _ ) , and in some cases the modification of the proper euclidean geometry is possible .",
    "however , the v - representation contains such a structure , as the linear vector space .",
    "one can not avoid this structure , because it is not clear , what structure may be used instead .",
    "modification of the proper euclidean geometry in the framework of the linear vector space is restricted rather strong .",
    "( it leads to the pseudo - euclidean geometries and to the riemannian geometries ) . besides , it appears , that there exist such modifications of the proper euclidean geometry , which are incompatible with the statement that any geometrical object may be constructed of points and vectors .",
    "the @xmath0-representation of the proper euclidean geometry is most appropriate for modification , because it contains only one basic element ( _ point _ ) .",
    "any modification of the proper euclidean geometry is accompanied by a modification of the structure , associated with the @xmath0-representation .",
    "this structure is distance ( world function ) , and any modification of the proper euclidean geometry is accompanied by a modification of world function ( distance ) , and vice versa .",
    "the meaning of distance is quite clear .",
    "this concept appears in all representations of the proper euclidean geometry , but only in the @xmath0-representation the distance ( world function ) plays the role of a structure , determining the geometry .",
    "modification of the distance means a deformation of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "the v - representation appeared in the nineteenth century , and most of contemporary mathematician and physicists use this representation .",
    "the @xmath0-representation appeared recently in the end of the twentieth century .",
    "besides , it appears in implicit form in the papers , devoted to construction of t - geometry @xcite . in these papers the term `` @xmath20-representation ''",
    "was not mentioned , and the @xmath0-representation was considered as an evident possibility of the geometry description in terms of the world function .",
    "apparently , such a possibility was evident only for the author of the papers , but not for readers .",
    "now we try to correct our default and to discuss properties of the @xmath0-representation of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "let @xmath5 be the set of points of the euclidean space .",
    "the distance @xmath22 between two points @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the euclidean space is known as the euclidean metric . in e - representation as well as in v - representation",
    "we have @xmath25it is convenient to use the world function @xmath26 as a main characteristic of the euclidean geometry . to approach this",

    "statistical description of the random world chain appears to be equivalent to the quantum description in terms of the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "thus , quantum effects are a corollary of the multivariance . here",
    "the multivariance is taken into account on the level of the space - time geometry . in conventional quantum theory",
    "the space - time geometry is single - variant , whereas the dynamics is multivariant , because , when one replaces the conventional dynamic variable by a matrix or by operator , one introduces the multivariance in dynamics .",
    "thus , the multivariance is a natural property of the real world . at the conventional approach",
    "one avoids the multivariance by hand from geometry and introduces it by hand in dynamics , to explain quantum effects .",
    "it would be more reasonable to remain the multivariance in the space - time geometry , because it appears there naturally . besides , multivariance of the space - time geometry has another corollaries , other than quantum effects .",

    "it is clear that the ball @xmath154 can not be constructed only of such tube segments .",
    "these hallow segments could not fill the ball completely . to fill the ball completely",

    "the problem of construction of the ball , consisting of basic elements ( points and segments ) , appears to be a very complicated problem in the modified geometry @xmath131 .",
    "this problem of the ball construction associates with the impossibility of deducing the geometry @xmath131 from a system of axioms .",
    "it seems that the geometry , deduced from the system of axioms , can not be multivariant , because any proposition , obtained from axioms by means of the formal logic is to be definite .",

    "on the other hand , the multivariance is an essential property of the real microcosm .",
    "it is a reason of quantum effects and atomism .",
    "the space - time geometry is a basis of dynamics in microcosm .",
    "thus , there are three different representation of the proper euclidean geometry . in the e - representation",
    "there are three basic elements : point , segment , angle .",
    "the segment and the angle are some auxiliary structures .",
    "the segment is determined by two points .",
    "the angle is determined by three points , or by two connected segments . in v - representation",
    "there are two basic elements : point and vector ( directed segment ) .",
    "the angle is replaced by two segments ( vectors ) .",
    "its value is determined by the scalar product of two vectors .",
    "reduction of the number of basic elements is accompanied by appearance of new structure : linear vector space with the scalar product , given on it .",
    "information , connected with the angle , is concentrated now in the scalar product and in the linear vector space .",
    "such a concept as distance is a property of a vector ( or a property of two points ) .    in the @xmath0-representation",
    "there is only one basic element : point .",
    "interrelation of two points ( segment ) is described by the world function ( distance ) .",
    "mutual directivity of segments , ( or an angle ) is considered as an interrelation of three points .",
    "it is described by means of the scalar product , expressed via distance ( world function ) . in @xmath0-representation",
    "the world function ( distance ) turns into a structure in the sense , that the world function satisfies a series of constraints ( conditions i @xmath64 iv ) .",
    "the concept of distance exists in all representations .",
    "but in the e - representation and in the v - representation the distance is not considered as a structure , because the conditions i @xmath64 iv are not considered as a constraints , imposed on the distance ( world function ) .",
    "of course , these conditions are fulfilled in all representations , but they are considered as direct properties of the proper euclidean space , but not as constraints , imposed on distance of the proper euclidean space .    the @xmath0-representation is interesting in the sense , that it contains only one basic element ( point ) and only one structure ( world function ) .",
    "all other concepts euclidean geometry appear to be expressed via world function . supposing that these expressions have the same form in other geometries , one can easily construct them , replacing world function .",
    "this replacement looks as a deformation of the proper euclidean space .",
    "usually a change of a representation is a formal operation , which is not accompanied by a change of basic concepts .",
    "for instance , representations in different coordinate systems differ only in the form of corresponding algebraic expressions .",
    "a change of representation of the proper euclidean geometry is accompanied by a change of basic concepts , when the primary concepts turns to the secondary ones and vice versa .",
    "such a change of primary concepts is unusual and difficult for a perception .    in particular , such difficulties of perception",
    "appear , because the linear vector space is considered as an attribute of the geometry ( but not as an attribute of the geometry description ) .",
    "the linear vector space is an attribute of the v - representation of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "there are geometries ( physical geometries ) , where the linear vector space can not be introduced at all .",
    "physical geometries are described completely by the world function , and the world function is the only characteristic of the physical geometry .",
    "all other attributes of the physical geometry are derivative . they can be introduced only via the world function .",
    "the physical geometry can not be axiomatized , in general .",
    "the proper euclidean geometry @xmath177 is an unique known example of the physical geometry , which can be axiomatized .",
    "axiomatization of the proper euclidean geometry @xmath177 is used for construction of @xmath177 . when the proper euclidean geometry @xmath177 is constructed ( deduced from the euclidean axiomatics )",
    ", one uses the fact that the @xmath177 is a physical geometry .",
    "one expresses all propositions of the proper euclidean geometry @xmath177 in terms of the euclidean world function @xmath164 . replacing @xmath164 in all propositions of the @xmath177 by another world function @xmath0 ,",

    "it means that one obtains another physical geometry @xmath178 , which can not be axiomatized ( and deduced from some axiomatics )    impossibility of the geometry @xmath178 axiomatization is conditioned be the fact , that the equivalence relation is intransitive , in general , in the geometry @xmath178 .",
    "however , in any mathematical model , as well as in any geometry , which can be axiomatized , the equivalence relation is to be transitive .",
