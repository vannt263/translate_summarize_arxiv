    "there is growing interest in the local deviations from the average structure recently observed in cuprate superconductors .",
    "these local inhomogeneities are often identified with one - dimensional conducting domains of increased carrier density and antiferromagnetic carrier depleted domains.@xcite in some theoretical approaches such stripes are believed to play a role in the mechanism underlying high-@xmath8 superconductivity .",
    "recently , the anelastic relaxation spectrum of undoped la@xmath0cuo@xmath9 has been found to exhibit two intense relaxation processes , attributed to intrinsic relaxational dynamics of unstable lattice modes , namely quasi - rigid tilts of the o octahedra.@xcite the relaxation process below @xmath10k is related to an instability toward the ltt structure , while the high - temperature process is thermally activated with an activation energy around 2800@xmath11k . in the present report combined anelastic and @xmath2la nqr relaxation measurements of la@xmath0cuo@xmath12 are presented and interpreted in terms of the collective dynamics of tilting cuo@xmath6 octahedra in double - well potentials .",
    "the tilt waves can be considered the equivalent in the undoped system of the lattice stripes and structural inhomogeneities observed in high-@xmath8 superconducting oxides .",
    "the sample was a sintered bar @xmath13  mm@xmath14 of la@xmath0cuo@xmath12 ; the excess o was extracted by outgassing at 750  @xmath15c down to an o@xmath0 partial pressure of the order of 10@xmath16  torr .",
    "such treatments can introduce few at% of o vacancies in the cuo@xmath0 planes,@xcite which are reversibly filled after reoxidizing at high temperature .",
    "these vacancies do not affect the anelastic or the nqr relaxation , being static at the temperatures of interest ( below 500@xmath11k ) .",
    "the o stoichiometry in the as - prepared state is estimated@xcite @xmath17 .",
    "details on the sample preparation and characterization can be found in ref .  .",
    "the elastic energy loss coefficient @xmath18 , measured by exciting the flexural vibrations , is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the complex dynamic compliance , with unrelaxed value @xmath21 .",
    "the contribution to the imaginary susceptibility from a relaxation process with characteristic time @xmath22 is @xcite @xmath23\\,\\,\\omega \\tau \\,/\\,[1+\\left ( \\omega \\tau \\right ) ^{2 } ]   \\label{q-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the atomic fraction of relaxing entities , each producing a change @xmath25 of the strain @xmath26 when its state changes ; @xmath27 is the measuring frequency .",
    "the @xmath28 curve has a maximum at the temperature where @xmath29 , yielding the relaxation rate at the peak temperature .",
    "the main processes appearing in the anelastic spectrum of la@xmath0cuo@xmath12 above 100@xmath11k are due to the diffusive jumps of the interstitial o atoms .",
    "the peak attributed to the tilts of the o octahedra appears only after reducing the content of excess o down to very low levels ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "in fact the interstitial o atoms block the relaxational motion of several surrounding octahedra.@xcite the anelastic peak in the nearly stoichiometric state is shown in fig . 1 ( left hand scale ) .",
    "the two sets of data refer to the excitation of two flexural modes ( 460  hz and 5.9  khz ) .",
    "the peak due to o diffusion was 30 times smaller than in the as prepared state , indicating a concentration of residual oxygen @xmath31 ; such a small contribution has been subtracted in fig . 1 .    the @xmath2la nqr relaxation rate @xmath32 in the same sample is also shown in fig .",
    "1 ( right hand scale ) , again after subtraction of the contribution from the residual interstitial o which gives a monotonous increase of @xmath32 for @xmath33k.@xcite in la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath12 the @xmath2la nqr relaxation can be due to magnetic or quadrupolar mechanisms.@xcite the magnetic relaxation is due to the fluctuation of the field at the la site , arising from the time dependence due to the cu@xmath36 spin operators .",
    "the quadrupolar mechanism is due to the fluctuation of the transverse components of the electric field gradient at the la site , mainly caused by the vibrations of the surrounding o ions , or by a diffusing interstitial o atom passing close to the la nucleus .",
    "the two types of relaxation are described by different recovery laws,@xcite so allowing the identification of the relaxation mechanism by irradiating different nqr lines .",
    "the coincidence in fig .",
    "2 of the recovery plots of the nqr echo signals at @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 $ ] @xmath40 6.2  mhz , @xmath41 is the @xmath2la quadrupole moment ) for @xmath42k indicate that above this temperature the mechanism is totally quadrupolar , i.e. due to the diffusion of interstitial o ( subtracted in fig . 1 ) and to the motion of the apical o atoms .",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath43 , determined from the condition @xmath44 at the maxima of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 curves , is plotted in fig . 3 in logarithmic scale against the reciprocal of temperature .",
    "the three points can be closely fitted by a straight line @xmath47 , @xmath48  s and @xmath49k , clearly indicating that the same process is observed by both techniques .",
    "the relaxation character of the responses imply that the apical o atoms in the lao planes perform pseudo - diffusive motion in a strongly anharmonic potential .",
    "such a potential should be associated with the softer lattice modes of the rigid - unit type , which are low frequency modes involving relative rotations of rigid lattice units , with little or no distortion of the units ( which would increase the restoring force and frequency of the mode ) .",
    "one can assume that the displacement of an apical o atom represents the rotation of the rigid octahedron , and both the anelastic and nqr relaxation are due to the switching of the octahedra between different tilts in multiwell potentials .",
    "such potentials have been calculated for la@xmath0cuo@xmath9@xcite and optimally doped la@xmath34ba@xmath35cuo@xmath12@xcite and la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath12.@xcite minima were found for tilts corresponding to displacements of the apical o atoms by @xmath50    in the @xmath51 $ ] directions ( parallel to the in - plane cuo bonds ) , corresponding to the low - temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) structure , separated by an energy barrier of @xmath52  mev ( @xmath53k ) .",
    "additional minima are found in correspondence to the low - temperature tetragonal ( ltt ) structure with tilts about the @xmath54 $ ] directions,@xcite but the ltt domains can be observed by diffraction experiments only when doping around @xmath55 by ba or combined sr and nd substitution.@xcite in the following both the anelastic and nqr measurements are interpreted in terms of cooperative motion of the octahedra in such multiwell potentials .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath2la nqr relaxation due to the atomic displacements @xmath56 of the apical o atoms surrounding the la nucleus .",
    "in order to simplify the interpretation , we will assume uncorrelated motion of such atoms , and approximate the relaxation rate @xmath57 in the form@xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a constant of the order of @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the autocorrelation function of the motion of the apical oxygen and @xmath62 the corresponding spectral density .",
    "if @xmath56 can switch between two values @xmath63 corresponding to two tilt orientations with probability @xmath64 , then the correlation function is @xmath65 and the nqr rate becomes @xmath66\\ , .",
    "\\label{nqrrelax}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the correlation time .",
    "the imaginary part of the elastic compliance @xmath67 can be expressed in terms of the spectral density of the autocorrelation function of the macroscopic strain @xmath68@xcite @xmath69 @xmath70 being the sample volume . in the assumption that @xmath68 is directly related to the displacements @xmath56 of the o apical atoms , eqs .",
    "( [ q-1 ] ) and ( [ s  ] ) differ from eqs .",
    "( [ w_q ] ) and ( [ nqrrelax ] ) only by a factor @xmath71 and by the constants expressing the dependence of strain and nqr frequency on the atomic displacements .",
    "now it must be explained why the apparent activation energy @xmath72 for the switching rate @xmath43 is higher than the theoretically estimated local potential barrier @xmath73.@xcite this is related to the cooperative character of the motion of the octahedra , which has been widely discussed by markiewicz.@xcite he considered an ltt ground state and observed that , neglecting intraplane interactions , the octahedra along directions perpendicular to the tilt axes are strongly correlated , since they share the o atoms which are displaced from the cuo plane , while adjacent rows are weakly correlated , since the shared o  atoms remain in the cuo plane .",
    "the system is thus reduced to a one - dimensional array of rows of octahedra , where all the octahedra belonging to the same row are tilted according to the same pattern .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are non - linear and admit solitonic solutions , which correspond to one - dimensional propagating walls between domains with different tilt patterns.@xcite this analysis allows one to apply the one - dimensional models of non - linear lattice dynamics which have been used to describe structural phase - transformations,@xcite as well as the correlated dynamics of off - centre atoms in perovskites.@xcite one can consider a potential of the form @xmath74 , where each atom moves in two minima separated by an energy barrier @xmath75 with a bilinear coupling to the neighbors .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath76 takes into account a cluster average over configurations .",
    "the resulting equation of motion has solitonic solutions similar to those found for the octahedra in la@xmath0cuo@xmath9,@xcite and it can be proved@xcite that the spectral density @xmath77 contains both a resonant peak at the frequency of vibration in each well , and a central peak of pseudo - diffusional character with characteristic frequency @xmath78 with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the average velocity of propagation of the soliton - like excitation through the atoms spaced by @xmath82 .",
    "these solitonic solutions provide the observed relaxational contribution to the spectral density and susceptibility .",
    "the effective potential barrier @xmath83 is increased with respect to the local barrier @xmath73 by the interaction between the octahedra .    in fitting the experimental data with the above model ,",
    "a distribution of the values of @xmath84 has been introduced , corresponding to the distribution in size and shape of the regions where the octahedra clusters build up the cooperative dynamics .",
    "such regions are limited by the excess o atoms , which block the relaxational dynamics .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath76 was distributed according to a gaussian , resulting in a distribution of effective energy barriers @xmath72 .",
    "a feature of the anelastic peak which can not directly be accounted for by the above formulas is the increase of its intensity at higher temperature , instead of a decrease as expected from eq .",
    "( [ q-1 ] ) .",
    "such a temperature dependence is observed in the case of relaxation among states which differ in energy by @xmath85 . in this case",
    "the relaxation strength must be multiplied by a factor containing the product of their equilibrium occupation numbers,@xcite @xmath86 ^{-2}$ ] .",
    "this causes a decrease of the relaxation strength below @xmath87 .",
    "the relaxation rate must be multiplied by @xmath88 , but this correction does not affect sizably the relaxation curves . the expression of the nqr rate should be modified in the same manner.@xcite it should be remarked that these corrections are strictly valid for relaxation between levels without cooperative effects , and their extension to the above model of cluster dynamics is not obvious .",
    "the resulting fit is shown in fig . 1 as continuous lines .",
    "the mean values @xmath89 @xmath90s and @xmath91k are the same as deduced from the condition @xmath92 at the maxima ( fig .",
    "the effective barrier @xmath72 is compatible with the theoretically estimated@xcite local barrier of @xmath93k with a mean coupling constant @xmath94 .",
    "the width of the distribution of @xmath84 is @xmath95 for the nqr and @xmath96 for the anelastic  data ( a temperature dependent width may result from the ordering of interstitial o ) ; the resulting distribution in @xmath97 is gaussian with a width of @xmath98k .",
    "the asymmetry energy @xmath99k is 10 times smaller than @xmath72 and therefore it does not affect the overall picture .    the fit value for the strength of the nqr relaxation mechanism is @xmath100  khz ; @xmath101 can be estimated in the hypothesis of independent displacements of the o atoms , assuming @xmath102 @xmath103 ( @xmath104   is the la - o distance ) , and for @xmath105    it yields a relaxation strength @xmath106",
    "@xmath107 @xmath108  mhz , about a factor 100 larger than the experimental one .",
    "a reduction of the strength of the relaxation mechanism may be due to the correlation between the displacements of the five apical o atoms surrounding the la nucleus , giving rise to a form factor which multiplies the spectral density .",
    "this correction , however , can hardly produce a reduction by 100 times , which is likely to reflect the fraction of octahedra which are instantaneously changing the tilt orientation . in a simple picture one can consider independent solitonic domain walls ( dw ) , corresponding to tilt waves which propagate through the lattice with velocity @xmath81 ; each la nucleus contributes to the nqr relaxation only when run over by the tilt wave , so that the relaxation strength should be reduced by the fraction of octahedra within the domain walls .",
    "along the same line , one could attribute the observed increase of the anelastic relaxation intensity with temperature to a temperature dependent volume fraction of dw , instead of introducing the asymmetry energy @xmath109 .",
    "an increase of dw density , roughly as @xmath110 , is indeed observed on approaching martensitic transformations,@xcite but is not sufficient to explain the increase of the anelastic relaxation strength by 30% from 147 to 170@xmath11k ( fig . 1 , taking into account the @xmath111 factor in eq .",
    "( [ q-1 ] ) ) . in the present case ,",
    "the dw exist below the transformation from the high temperature tetragonal structure to the lto structure at @xmath112k and their density would increase of only 6% on increasing the temperature from 147 to 170@xmath11k .    from the close coincidence of the relaxation rate describing the anelastic and nqr results",
    ", it is deduced that the propagation of soliton - like walls is the origin of both types of relaxation , and that there is a direct relationship between the atomic displacement @xmath113 and macroscopic strain @xmath114 whose spectral densities are probed by the two experiments .",
    "such a direct relationship can be assumed for the movement of a wall separating two lto domains with opposite signs of the in - plane shear strain @xmath115 ( in lto notation , with @xmath59 and @xmath116 directions at @xmath117 with the cuo bonds ) . the propagation of such dw changes the domain sizes and therefore modulates @xmath26 .",
    "the spatial arrangement of the domains of tilted octahedra can not be deduced by our data , but the above analysis corresponds to an array of propagating parallel fronts of tilt waves .",
    "similarly , the picture proposed by markiewicz@xcite for la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath12 is a ltt ground state with lowest energy excitations consisting of parallel propagating lto walls .",
    "a closely spaced structure of alternating ltt domains and propagating lto walls would form a so - called dynamic jahn - teller phase with average orthorhombic structure , and conventional diffraction measurements would see the average structure ( the intermediate structure between two lto domains is ltt and viceversa ) .",
    "such a microstructure closely corresponds to the lattice stripes proposed by bianconi _",
    "et al_. on the basis of exafs results in the same doped material la@xmath118sr@xmath119cuo@xmath12@xcite and in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath120.@xcite stripes have also been observed by neutron diffraction@xcite in la@xmath121nd@xmath122sr@xmath123cuo@xmath9 with @xmath124 , where they are pinned by the formation of a stable ltt structure .",
    "also our @xmath2la spectra exhibit asymmetric broadening of the lines split by the local magnetic field observed by other authors,@xcite supporting the picture of channels where the charges doped by the residual excess o are mobile and depress the antiferromagnetic order .",
    "in summary , thermally activated relaxation processes due to strongly anharmonic lattice modes have been evidenced in nearly stoichiometric la@xmath125cuo@xmath12 from the elastic susceptibility and @xmath2la nqr relaxation rate versus temperature , as a low - frequency tail of the spectral density of the atomic motions .",
    "the pseudo - diffusive motions have been identified as the tilt modes of the o octahedra in a multi - well potential . in the interpretation",
    ", we have used the fact that the dynamics of the octahedra in the @xmath126 plane can be cast into a non - linear one - dimensional equation , which admits solitonic solutions corresponding to propagating walls between domains with different tilt patterns .",
    "thus it has been possible to rely on the analysis of similar one - dimensional systems , for which the spectral density contains a pseudo - diffusive central peak of width @xmath127 related to the soliton - like lattice excitations .",
    "the measured effective barrier @xmath128k is about 5 times higher than the barrier of the theoretically estimated local potential , due to the cooperative character of the motion .",
    "the alternating lto domains and ltt walls should correspond to the lattice stripes observed in superconducting oxides .",
