    "the material in this paper can be motivated both by abstract questions in linear algebra about the spectra of sets of matrices , and by the study of asymptotic behaviour in dynamical systems .",
    "the connection is quite natural : given a sufficiently smooth dynamical system , the structure or spectra of the jacobian matrices associated with the system may determine certain behaviours , for example the possibility of various local bifurcations , and more generally the possibility of multiple steady states , oscillations or chaos . given a set @xmath1 and a map @xmath2 , define @xmath3 we may ask , for example :    1 .",
    "`` is @xmath4 ? '' 2 .",
    "`` does @xmath5 intersect the imaginary axis ? '' 3 .",
    "`` does the nonreal part of @xmath6 intersect both left and right open half - planes of @xmath7 ? ''    and so forth .",
    "the best - known special case is where @xmath8 is a `` qualitative class '' , namely it consists of all matrices with some sign pattern , in which case q1 reduces to the well - studied _ combinatorial _ problem of characterising sign nonsingular matrices @xcite . by an easy argument , given convex",
    "open @xmath9 , and a @xmath10 function @xmath11 , sign nonsingularity of the jacobian matrices @xmath12 in fact implies injectivity of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "apart from such applications , exploration of the zero patterns of sign nonsingular matrices has led to a rich combinatorial theory @xcite .    if @xmath8 arises as the jacobian matrices of some family of vector fields , a negative answer to either q2 or q3 implies that this family does not admit hopf bifurcation . in this paper",
    "it will be q3 which is of primary interest .",
    "the philosophical approach taken is quite analogous to that taken in the study of sign nonsingularity . as a general principle , when posing some question about a set of matrices @xmath14 , one hopes to associate with elements of @xmath14 discrete objects such as graphs which are constant or vary little over @xmath14 , and then reduce the question to some finite computation on these objects .",
    "the most obvious example is again when @xmath14 is a qualitative class , which can naturally be associated with a signed digraph , or a signed bipartite graph .",
    "however , more generally , products of matrices which have constant sign pattern ( or some of which are constant ) also arise naturally in applications . to see why it is worth going beyond qualitative classes ,",
    "we introduce the notion of an `` interaction network '' as described in @xcite .",
    "consider a system consisting of @xmath15 species with values ( amounts , concentrations , populations , etc . )",
    "define @xmath17 to be the state of the system .",
    "suppose that amongst these species there are @xmath18 interactions , each involving some nonempty subset of the species , and occurring at rates @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) dependent on the state @xmath21 , but independent of time .",
    "define the rate function @xmath22 by @xmath23 .",
    "finally , for @xmath24 , let @xmath25 describe the total rate of change of species @xmath26 as a function of the interaction rates .",
    "the evolution of the system is then given by : @xmath27 or more briefly , defining @xmath28 by @xmath29 , @xmath30 assume that @xmath13 and @xmath31 are @xmath10 functions , so that by the chain rule , @xmath32 for our purposes here , the important point is that the right hand side of an interaction network ( [ genprodform1 ] ) is defined as a composition of functions , and hence its jacobian matrices have a natural factorisation ( [ decomp ] ) .",
    "this factorisation was the starting point for quite general combinatorial approaches to questions of injectivity and multistationarity in interaction networks in @xcite , and the treatment here relies heavily on the ideas first presented there .",
    "( [ genprodform1 ] ) is not restrictive since an arbitrary system of autonomous first order differential equations can be represented in this way by choosing , for example , one of @xmath31 or @xmath13 to be the identity function . thus casting a system as an interaction network",
    "can not be done uniquely , and can be seen as a formalism for studying certain questions about the system , rather than a categorisation of the system .",
    "however the usefulness of this construction is most apparent when @xmath13 and @xmath31 are defined by natural physical constraints as we shall see below .",
    "models of systems of chemical reactions , termed `` chemical reaction networks '' or crns , naturally take the interaction network form : in fact ( [ genprodform1 ] ) reduces to @xmath33 where @xmath34 is now a constant @xmath35 matrix , termed the `` stoichiometric matrix '' of the system , and @xmath36 is the vector of reaction rates . as the state variables are chemical concentrations , the natural state space is the nonnegative orthant in @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 . the jacobian matrices become @xmath39 moreover , under mild physical assumptions , the sign pattern of @xmath40 may be related to that of @xmath34 . for example , if @xmath41 , no chemical occurs on both sides of any reaction , and all chemical reactions are reversible , then we expect @xmath42 to have the same sign as @xmath43 .",
    "this will be discussed further below .",
    "the results will be developed as follows . in section  [ sec : prelim ] a considerable volume of preliminary material is gathered for subsequent use .",
    "this includes definitions , notation and known results , along with a few new but relatively straightforward lemmas .",
    "section  [ sec : c2decomp ] constructs an object termed the `` dsr@xmath44}$ ] graph '' , which is the central tool required for everything to follow .",
    "this is followed , in section  [ sec : results1 ] by a series of claims which can be made immediately from observation of the dsr@xmath44}$ ] graph combined with the results in section  [ sec : prelim ] , and without the need for deeper theory .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] contains technical results on the dsr@xmath44}$ ] graph which allow , in section  [ sec : final ] some nontrivial extensions of the results of earlier sections .",
    "section  [ sec : final ] also describes limitations of the theory developed , and suggests the way forward .",
    "examples are interspersed throughout , and we return to examples to note how the analysis becomes more sophisticated or more rapid as the theoretical tools are developed .",
    "similarly we sometimes prove results which later become corollaries of deeper results ; although this adds to the length of the paper , it is intended to make the material more transparent .",
    "remarks linking results here to related published work , and also to the study of crns , are interspersed throughout .",
    "the frequent reference to crns reflects the fact that although these systems are only one possible application for the theory , they were an important motivator for this work .",
    "preliminaries[sec : prelim ]      this paper is concerned with sets of real matrices .",
    "these can be naturally identified with subsets of euclidean space , thus inheriting topological properties such as openness , closedness and connectedness .",
    "we begin with the most fundamental of these sets : a matrix @xmath45 determines the * qualitative class * @xmath46 consisting of all matrices with the same sign pattern as @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48 if and only if @xmath49 ; @xmath50 ; and @xmath51 . the closure of @xmath52 will be written @xmath53 , while the closure of a more general @xmath54 will be written @xmath55 .",
    "a square matrix @xmath47 is * sign nonsingular * if all matrices in @xmath52 are nonsingular and * sign singular * if all matrices in @xmath52 are singular @xcite .",
    "[ rem : crnjacobian ] * jacobian matrices of crns . * returning to ( [ genprodformcrn ] ) and the subsequent discussion , the notation developed above allows us to abbreviate the condition `` @xmath42 has the same sign as @xmath43 for all @xmath56 '' as @xmath57 .",
    "more generally , for systems of reactions where no chemical occurs on both sides of any reaction , we expect the condition @xmath58 to hold on the entire nonnegative orthant , including the boundary . even when this does not hold ( namely when some chemical occurs on both sides of some reaction ) , provided every reversible reaction is treated as a pair of irreversible reactions , we still expect @xmath40 to belong to the closure of a qualitative class which can be inferred from the network structure .",
    "thus quite generally , the jacobian matrices of a crn take the form of a constant matrix times a matrix belonging to some qualitative class .",
    "given an @xmath35 matrix @xmath47 , and nonempty @xmath59 , @xmath60 , define @xmath61 to be the submatrix of @xmath47 obtained by choosing rows of @xmath47 from @xmath62 and columns from @xmath63 , and ( provided @xmath64 ) @xmath65 $ ] to be the corresponding minor of @xmath47 .",

    "indeed a real eigenvalue of @xmath284}$ ] may pass through zero as a consequence of migration of eigenvalues of @xmath120 on the real axis without any possibility of hopf bifurcation .",
    "this limitation may be circumvented by resorting to conditions that distinguish imaginary pairs of eigenvalues of @xmath120 from pairs of real eigenvalues summing to zero , for example based on subresultant criteria @xcite .",
    "natural extensions of the work here involve exploiting such criteria , and also examining other graphs related to @xmath120 whose cycle structure contains information about hopf bifurcation .",
