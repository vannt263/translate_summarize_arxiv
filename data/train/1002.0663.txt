    "particle polarizability governs the electric response for many inhomogeneous systems ranging from biological cells to plasmonic nanoparticles and depends strongly on both its dielectric and geometric properties .",
    "analytical models have been reported @xcite only for spherical and ellipsoidal geometries , whereas more complex geometries have been approached by direct numerical solution of the field equations using , for example , the finite difference methods @xcite , the finite element method @xcite , the boundary element method @xcite , or the boundary integral equation ( bie ) @xcite .    in a simplified representation",
    ", biological cells can be regarded as homogeneous particles ( cores ) covered by thin membranes ( shells ) of contrasting electric conductivities and permittivities .",
    "complex geometries occur when cells are undergoing division cycles ( e.g. budding yeasts ) or are coupled in functional tissues ( e.g. lining epithelia or myocardial syncytia ) . in these cases , the dielectric / impedance analysis of cellular systems is far more complicated than previous models @xcite , which considered suspensions of spherical particles .",
    "intriguing dielectric spectra @xcite reveal distinct dielectric dispersions with time evolutions consistently related to tissue functioning or alteration , identifying a possible role of cell connectors ( gap junctions ) in shaping the overall dielectric response .",
    "a direct relation between the microscopic parameters and experimental data can be analytically derived only for dilute suspensions of particles of simple shapes , and is rather challenging for system with more realistic shapes , where only purely numerical solutions have been available . in this work",
    "we demonstrate that a spectral representation of a bie provides the analytical structure for the polarizability of particles with a wide range of shapes and structures .",
    "the numerically calculated parameters encode particle s geometry information and are accessible by experiments .    by using single and double - layer potentials",
    "@xcite , the laplace equation for the fields inside and outside the particle is transformed into an integral equation .",
    "a spectral representation for the solution of this equation is obtained providing the eigenvalue problem for the linear response operator is solved .",
    "although not symmetric , this operator has a real spectrum bounded by -1/2 and 1/2 @xcite and its eigenvectors are orthogonal to those of the conjugate double - layer operator .",
    "a matrix representation is obtained by using a finite basis of surface functions .",
    "the true advantage of the spectral method is that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the integral operator provide valuable insight into the dielectric behavior of clusters of biological cells .",
    "the eigenvectors are a measure of surface charge distributions due to a field . only eigenvectors with a non - zero dipole moment contribute to the polarizability of the particle .",
    "we call these dipole - active eigenmodes . an effective separation of the geometric and morphologic properties from dielectric properties is therefore achieved @xcite .",
    "we also show that for a particle covered by multiple confocal shells , the relaxation spectrum is a sum of debye terms with the number of relaxations equal to the number of interfaces times the number of dipole - active eigenvalues .",
    "this is a generalization of a previous result @xcite on cells of arbitrary shape .",
    "our method is related to another spectral approach which uses an eigenvalue differential equation @xcite .",
    "this method has been applied to biological problems by lei _",
    "_ @xcite and by huang _",
    "these authors , however , considered homogeneous cells with much simpler expression for cell polarizability . the bie spectral method seeks a solution on the boundary surface defining the particle , as opposed to the eigenvalue differential equation , where the solution is defined in the entire space .    in a previous study on double ( budding ) cells",
    "it was shown that before cells separation an additional dispersion occurs @xcite . moreover , in recent papers @xcite numerical experiments have shown that the dielectric spectra of a suspension of dimer cells connected by tight junctions exhibit an additional , distinct low - frequency relaxation .",
    "our numerical calculation shows that the largest dipole - active eigenvalue approaches the value of 1/2 as the junction become tighter .",
    "although the coupling of this eigenmode with the electric field stimulus is relatively modest ( the coupling weight is about 1 - 2 % ) , this eigenmode has a significant contribution to the polarizability of clusters .",
    "thus the eigenmodes close to 1/2 induce an additional low - frequency relaxation in the dielectric spectra of clustered biological cells even though the coupling is quite small .",
    "needle - like objects , such as elongated spheroids or long cylinders , have similar polarizability features .    in this paper",
    "we consider rotationally symmetric linear clusters made of up to 4 identical particles covered by thin insulating membranes and connected by junctions of variable tightness .",
    "convenient and flexible representations for the surfaces describing these objects are provided .",
    "the number of relaxations in the dielectric spectrum of the linear clusters , their time constants and their relative strengths are analyzed in terms of the eigenmodes of the linear response operator specific to the given shape .",
    "we consider a suspension of identical , randomly oriented particles of arbitrary shape and dielectric permittivity , @xmath0 , immersed in a dielectric medium of dielectric permittivity , @xmath1 .",
    "the dielectric permittivities are in general complex quantities and the theory described here applies also for time - dependent fields , providing that the size of a particle is much smaller than the wavelength . when an applied uniform electric field interacts with the suspension , the response of the system is linear with the applied field and an effective permittivity for the whole sample can be measured and is defined by @xcite : @xmath2 this result is obtained in the limit of low concentration , weak intensity of the stimulus field , and using an effective medium theory within the dipole approximation . here",
    "@xmath3 is the volume fraction of all @xmath4 particles , each of volume @xmath5 , with respect to the total volume of the suspension @xmath6 .",
    "the averaged normalized polarizability @xmath7 of a particle is defined as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electric field perturbation created inside the particle under a normalized applied electric excitation with direction @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the solid angle element generated by that direction .",
    "the above normalized polarizability is dimensionless and is obtained by multiplying the standard polarizability of a particle with the factor @xmath12 . in the following",
    "we will refer only to normalized polarizability , thus , without any confusion , the normalized polarizability @xmath7 will be simply called polarizability",
    ". the directional average in is equivalent to the averaged sum over three orthogonal axes due to the fact that the problem is linear with respect to the applied field .",
    "the latter is more convenient from computational point of view .",
    "the electric field inside a particle is obtained by solving the following laplace equation for the electric potential @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the euclidian 3-dimensional space and @xmath16 is the surface of the particle .",
    "the derivatives are taken with respect to the normal vector @xmath17 to the surface @xmath16 .",
    "due to the mismatch between the polarization inside and outside the object , electric charges accumulate at the interface @xmath18 and create an electric potential which counteracts the uniform electric field stimulus .",

    ", if @xmath27 is a right eigenvector of @xmath23 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a left eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath31 , @xmath32 , then @xmath33 with the scalar product defined as the integral over the interface @xmath18 , @xmath34    the value 1/2 is always the largest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath23 , regardless the geometry of the object .",
    "this is immediately seen if the object is considered to be conductor ( @xmath35 ) , and then the interior electric field has to be zero . in that case @xmath36 , and the charge density that generates a vanishing internal electric field obeys the equation @xmath37 , and therefore 1/2 is an eigenvalue of @xmath23 .",
    "however , this eigenmode is not dipole - active and does not contribute to the total polarization of the object .",
    "the operator is insensitive to a scale transformation , which means that its eigenvalue and eigenvectors depend only on the shape of the object and not on its size , or electrical properties .    by employing the spectral representation of the resolvent of the operator @xmath23 @xmath38 the solution of equation",
    "is obtained for @xmath39 as @xmath40    the polarizability of the homogeneous particle is obtained by using the distribution to build the solution of the laplace equation and use it in equation .",
    "it has been shown that , operationally , the polarizability is simply the dipole moment of the distribution over unit volume @xcite    @xmath41    where @xmath42 are three mutually orthogonal vectors ( directions ) of unit norm .",
    "the factor @xmath43 is a generalized clausius - mosotti factor .",

    "for example , @xmath67 is    @xmath76    the field generated by the the two distributions @xmath54 and @xmath55 outside the particle is the same as the field generated by an equivalent single layer distribution @xmath77 where @xmath78 and the equivalent permittivity @xmath79 is defined for each eigenmode as : @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the distribution is similar with the distribution obtained for a homogeneous particle , except that @xmath82 has to be replaced for each mode with an equivalent quantity @xmath83 .",
    "equation can be applied recursively for a multi - shelled structure .",
    "the strict separation of electric and geometric properties is weakened in this case , because the shape - dependent eigenvalue @xmath84 appears now in the electric equivalent quantity @xmath85 .",
    "the polarizability of the shelled particle is obtained by using the distribution to build the solution of the laplace equation and use it in equation , to get @xmath86 equation is obtained by replacing @xmath82 with @xmath85 in eq . .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 in eq . is the total volume of the cell ( the core and the shells ) . in the limit of a dilute suspension of identical shelled particles , with a low volume fraction @xmath87 ,",
    "the effective permittivity is @xmath88      in general , the effective permittivity @xmath89 of a suspension of objects with @xmath90 shells will have _ _",
    "m__+1 debye relaxation terms for each dipole active eigenmode .",
    "the proof is recursive and is based on partial fraction expansion with respect to variable @xmath91 of equations and , provided that the complex permittivity of various dielectric phases is @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the permittivity of the free space ( @xmath95 f / m ) .",
    "thus the first debye term comes out from and the remaining @xmath90 debye terms result from by the homogenization process described for shelled particles .",
    "hence , a suspension of cells with @xmath90 shells ( and @xmath96 interfaces ) has a dielectric spectrum containing a number of debye terms equal to @xmath96 times the number of dipole - active eigenvalues .",
    "the suspension effective permittivity @xmath89 has the expansion @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the high - frequency permittivity , and @xmath100 is the low - frequency conductivity ; @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the dielectric decrement and the relaxation time of the _ kj _ debye term , respectively ; index @xmath46 enumerates the dipole - active eigenmodes and index @xmath103 enumerates interfaces .",
    "although the measurable bulk quantities in equation are directly correlated with the microscopic ( electric and shape ) parameters , a solution of the inverse problem , which aims at obtaining the microscopic information non - intrusively , from the effective permittivity , is in general difficult , if not impossible for the general multi - shell structure .",
    "however , biological cell has a thin and almost non - conductive membrane , and several simplifications and approximations can be made .",
    "two debye relaxation terms in the effective permittivity @xmath89 are expected for each dipole - active eigenmode , corresponding to the two interfaces which define the membrane .",
    "the first relaxation is derived from the equivalent permittivity which can be written also as debye relaxation terms : @xmath104 the relaxation time @xmath105 that is given by the poles of @xmath106 in is a quite good approximation of the first relaxation time @xmath107 @xmath108 the main reason is as follows . at frequencies close to @xmath109",
    "there is a huge change in @xmath106 of order @xmath110 , and consequently a significant change in the total permittivity @xmath111 given by .",
    "therefore @xmath105 provides an approximate value for the relaxation time @xmath107 of the suspension effective permittivity @xmath111 .    for a non - conductive shell @xmath112 , or",
    "more precisely when @xmath113 , the relaxation time is : @xmath114 showing a strong dependence on the thickness of the shell and on the shape of the particle , through the eigenvalue @xmath28 .",
    "due to the small parameter @xmath115 in the first relaxation ( i. e. , membrane relaxation ) tends to have a lower frequency than the second relaxation , which is present even for particles with no shell ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "in addition , cumbersome but straightforward calculations provide the dielectric decrement @xmath116 in @xmath117 that is very large due to the same strong dependence on the thickness of the shell .",
    "the effect is even more dramatic when the second largest eigenvalue is very close to the largest eigenvalue , @xmath118 , like in the case of two cells connected by tight junctions .    for a suspension of shelled spheres @xmath119 and @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the thickness of the membrane ,",
    "@xmath122 is inner radius , and @xmath123 is the total radius .",
    "thus both @xmath107 and @xmath116 are proportional to @xmath122 and @xmath124 and inverse proportional to @xmath121 like in the pauly - schwan theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dielectric decrement @xmath116 in is a generalization of equation ( 54a ) in ref . @xcite . in the same time",
    ", the relaxation time differs with respect to equation ( 56a ) in ref .",
    "@xcite only by the conductivity term . we will show elsewhere that a more appropriate treatment of the relaxation times recovers also the relaxation time given by equation ( 54a ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , a non - conductive and thin shell / membrane produces a large relaxation of the complex permittivity of the suspension @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidences further support these theoretical facts : when attacking the membrane with a membrane disrupting compound ( for example a detergent ) the relaxation almost vanishes as the cellular membrane is permeated @xcite .    for frequencies higher than @xmath125 the cell permittivity is essentially determined by the dielectric properties of the cytoplasm , and does not depend on membrane s properties .",
    "the second debye relaxation occurs at higher frequencies than the first ( membrane ) relaxation , and has the relaxation time @xmath126 derived from the pole of equation .",
    "the corresponding dielectric decrement is @xmath127 the last two equations are similar to the ones that are given for spherical particles in ref .",
    "@xcite ( equations ( 46 ) and ( 49 ) in the aforementioned reference ) .",
    "the relaxation given by @xmath128 is basically the relaxation of a homogenous particle embedded in a dielectric environment and was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite by a closely related spectral method .",
    "if the conductivity of the cytoplasm is comparable to the conductivity of the outer medium , the decrement of the second relaxation is small such that it can not be distinguished in the spectrum . on the contrary , if the conductivity of the outer medium is much greater or smaller that that of cytoplasm , than a second observable relaxation occurs .",
    "unlike the membrane relaxation , this second relaxation depends only weakly on the shape . by assuming that @xmath129 and by using a finite - difference method ,",
    "this resonance was also obtained in @xcite and it was instrumental in explaining the experimental data on the fission of yeast cells of asami _ et al . _ @xcite by lei _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the shape of the particle is important because it affects the number of dipole - active eigenvalues and their strengths . in principle , each dipole - active eigenvalue introduces a new relaxation in the dielectric spectrum , providing this relaxation is well separated from the others .",
    "a cluster with complex geometry can have several dipole - active eigenvalues , but unless the cluster is larger in one dimension then in the others , or there are tight junctions , the relaxations overlap to create broad features in the spectrum .",
    "an extra relaxation is introduced when the particles are covered by thin membranes .",
    "in addition , if @xmath130 for that eigenvalue , then the shell induced relaxation has low frequency , large relaxation time and large dielectric decrement .",
    "based on the spectral bie method , it is therefore possible to explicitly relate the dielectric spectra of cell suspensions to cell s geometry and electric parameters , and , even design fitting procedures to evaluate these parameters from measurements .",
    "the calculation of the effective permittivity for a suspension uses equations or , and reduces then to finding the eigenvalues @xmath28 and eigenvectors @xmath131 and @xmath132 of the linear response operator @xmath23 .",
    "this problem is solved by employing a finite basis of _ nb _ functions defined on the surface @xmath16 . a natural basis for a surface not far from a sphere is the generalized hyperspherical harmonics functions @xmath133 where @xmath134 is related to the surface element through @xmath135 and @xmath136 is the solid angle element .",
    "another choice could be based on chebyshev polynomials of the first kind @xcite @xmath137 both bases are complete and orthogonal in the hilbert space of square integrable functions defined on @xmath16 .    in this paper , we model the linear cluster of particles as an object with axial symmetry .",
    "we seek to find a surface of revolution for which the thickness of the interparticle joints can be varied without perturbing the overall shape of the object .",
    "we use two representations for the surface @xmath16 : ( a ) for clusters of two particles we use spherical coordinates @xmath138 , and ( b ) for clusters with more than two particles we specify the surface in terms of a function @xmath139 as @xmath140 .    in the case",
    "b , the surface element is @xmath141 and the normal to surface @xmath18 is @xmath142    in the basis of generalized hyperspherical harmonics the operator @xmath23 has matrix elements given by    @xmath143    where @xmath144 and @xmath145^{3/2}}\\ ] ]    after the angle integration in equation and by using the elliptic integrals given in the appendix , the matrix elements are obtained by numerical evaluation of the resulting ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 ) double integral using an _ nq_-point gauss - legendre quadrature @xcite . because of the integrable singularity apparent in the kernel of the operator @xmath23 in equation , the mesh of @xmath146 must be shifted from the mesh of @xmath147 by a transformation which insures that there is no overlap between the two meshes .",
    "the delta symbols @xmath148 in equation reflects the fact that we consider only objects with rotational symmetry in this paper .",
    "moreover , for fields parallel with the cluster axis @xmath149 , while @xmath150 for perpendicular fields .    the convergence of the results is obtained in two steps .",
    "first , the number _ nq _ of quadrature points is increased until the matrix elements of @xmath23 converge , and then the size _ nb _ of the basis set is increased until the relevant eigenvalues @xmath28 and their corresponding weights @xmath49 have acquired the desired accuracy .",
    "a necessary test for convergence is the fulfillment of the sum rules @xmath151 and @xmath152 with sufficient accuracy @xcite .",
    "usually the convergence is fast in both the number of quadrature points and the size of basis , unless the system has a tight junction where some care must be considered in order to achieve the required accuracy of the eigenmodes with the eigenvalues close to @xmath153 .",
    "for a sphere there is just one dipole - active eigenmode which has eigenvalue @xmath154 and weight @xmath155 , while for an ellipsoid there is one dipole - active eigenmode along each axis .",
    "fast and accurate solutions are achieved for spheroids with a basis size of _ nb _",
    "= 20 and with _ nq _ = 64 quadrature points . in general , the size of the basis and the number of the quadrature points increase with the number of cells in the cluster and with the decreasing of the junction size .",
    "thus , for our numerical examples a basis with _ nb_=35 - 40 and _ nq _ = 128 quadrature points are enough for a converged solution in the case of the dimers and _ nb_=50 and _ nq _ = 200 quadrature points in the case of the clusters with up to four cells .",
