    "nanoscale magnetic materials are the subject of a currently increasing interest which is related both to the novel fundamental aspects of magnetic structure and dynamics on the nanometer - scale , and promising future technological applications , such as magnetic data storage elements , sensors or spin electronic devices ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "one novel approach to engineer single , i.e. well separated and individually addressable nanoscale magnets , is to utilize self - organization of nanostructures , such as carbon fullerenes , carbon nanotubes , silicon - carbon - nanorods and others .",
    "however , owing to a weak magnetic exchange between unpaired spins these materials often exhibit only a very small magnetic moment so that external magnetic fields barely interact with these nanostructures .",
    "one possible way to overcome this problem is to prepare self - organized nanoscale materials based on transition - metal ( tm ) oxide low - dimensional ( low - d ) structural units where complex strong electronic correlations in the spin- and charge sectors are expected .",
    "indeed , a variety of fascinating phenomena related to spin- and charge correlations in low - d tm oxides were found in the past years , ranging from high - temperature superconductivity in 2d - cuprates , a spin - peierls transition or a haldane spin - gap behavior in 1d - spin chain compounds , to superconductivity in 1d - spin ladder materials ( for recent reviews see e.g. ref .  ) .",

    "recently a new class of nanoscale spin magnets , mixed valence vanadium oxide multiwall nanotubes ( vo@xmath3-nts ) , has been introduced.@xcite the structure of the vo@xmath3-nt walls @xcite is closely related to that of barium vanadium oxide bronze bav@xmath4o@xmath5h@xmath6o ( fig .",
    "[ structurevox]).@xcite one finds there a v - metal ion in distorted octahedral and tetrahedral coordination , respectively .",
    "v - octahedra are coupled in edge - sharing zig - zag vo - chains .",
    "arrays of vo - chains form a double layer with tetrahedral v - sites lying between the two layers .",
    "mixed valence vanadium oxides , vo@xmath3 ( @xmath7 ) , are themselves very rich in electronic and magnetic properties owing to an intimate interplay between spin , orbital and charge degrees of freedom.@xcite when assembled in nanotubes ( nt ) using dodecylamine , c@xmath8h@xmath9nh@xmath6 , as a structure - directing surfactant molecule , vo@xmath3-nts show up diverse properties ranging from spin frustration and semiconductivity to ferromagnetism by doping with either electrons or holes.@xcite such a rich behavior makes this material very interesting from the viewpoint of fundamental research as well as regarding possible future applications mentioned above . in particular , its magnetic properties can be widely tuned by intercalation or electrochemical doping ( e.g. by lithium or iodine ) , thereby offering the possibility to realize novel nanoscale magneto - electronic devices .",
    "a detailed analysis of the magnetic properties is , therefore , important in order to correlate them with structure and morphology of vo@xmath3-nts for tailoring the magnetic properties of this nanostructured material .    in order to obtain a deeper insight into the magnetism of vo@xmath3-nts we have measured magnetization and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) of pristine , i.e. li - undoped , samples .",
    "the static magnetic data give evidence for the occurrence of magnetically nonequivalent vanadium sites in the structure .",
    "these sites can be presumably attributed to v@xmath10 ( @xmath11 , @xmath0 ) ions in the octahedral and tetrahedral oxygen coordination , respectively .",
    "the spins in the octahedral sites ( chain sites ) , are strongly antiferromagnetically correlated .",
    "one part of them is coupled in dimers and exhibits a spin - gap behavior . the other part forms trimers .",
    "they , together with much weaker correlated tetrahedral magnetic sites , dominate the low - temperature static magnetic response .",
    "nmr measurements on @xmath12v nuclei reveal relaxation channels with two distinctly different relaxation rates .",
    "though the longitudinal relaxation rate @xmath13 exhibits a strong temperature dependence the manifestation of a spin gap is obscured due to the presence of an appreciable amount of magnetic sites at low temperatures .",
    "we discuss possible mechanisms of vanadium nuclear spin relaxation and their interplay with the static magnetic properties .",
    "in particular , both nmr and the static susceptibility data give strong indications that owing to the pronounced structural low - dimensionality and mixed valency of vo@xmath3-nts different spin arrangements , namely individual spins , spin dimers and trimers , coexist in comparable amounts in this complex material .     in an external magnetic field of @xmath14 t (",

    "the nanotubes occur in two topological modifications , i.e. concentric shell tubes with closed edges of the vo@xmath3 sheets and scrolled tubes with open edges , with the latter topology being a predominant one . @xcite as one can see in fig .  1 of ref .  , however , the tube walls in our samples consist of a large number ( @xmath16 ) of vo@xmath3 layers .",
    "therefore one expects that such differences in the microscopic topology , yielding absence or presence of open vanadium edge sites plausibly different from those in the bulk of the wall , should not affect appreciably the bulk magnetic properties .    here",
    ", static magnetization measurements have been performed in the temperature range 2 - 500k with a squid magnetometer from quantum design in magnetic fields up to 5  t and with a home - made vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) in fields up to 15  t. upon heating , however , we observed indication that , above @xmath17370k , the material degenerates so that we restrict the data presented here to temperatures below 370k .",
    "presumably this sample degradation is due to the changes of the oxygen stoichiometry .",

    "_ we will start the discussion of the magnetization data by considering the response at @xmath50k , where the susceptibility can be described well in terms of non - interacting dimers and the curie - weiss law .",
    "different contributions to the magnetic susceptibility can be related to the occurrence of nonequivalent vanadium sites in the crystal structure of vo@xmath3-nts.@xcite the octahedrally coordinated v(1 ) and v(2 ) sites are found in the double layers ( fig .",
    "[ structurevox ] ) .",
    "tetrahedrally coordinated v(3 ) sites occur between the layers .",
    "the bond valence sums calculated for a closely related material bav@xmath4o@xmath5h@xmath6o suggest that vanadium in the v(3 ) position has a valency close to 4 + ( @xmath11 , @xmath0 ) , whereas vanadium in the positions v(1 ) and v(2 ) may be 4 + as well as 5 + ( @xmath51 , @xmath52).@xcite the mixed - valency in vo@xmath3-nts is confirmed by recent eels measurements which yield 60% of v@xmath10 and 40% of v@xmath53 in our samples.@xcite thus the concentration of magnetic v sites with @xmath34 amounts to 60% .",
    "this estimate is consistent with our nmr data ( see section  [ nmr ] below ) but , however , at first glance numerically contradicts the static magnetization data .",
    "indeed , the number of magnetically active sites contributing to the curie - weiss susceptibility and to the dimer susceptibility makes up @xmath54%+@xmath55%=45% only .",
    "the number @xmath56 , however , does not necessarily count only single @xmath34 v sites , which we will discuss in the following .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that owing to magnetic frustration the v(3 ) spins between the layers are interacting very weakly and that all magnetic v(3 ) sites are therefore contributing to the curie - like behavior of the static susceptibility.@xcite the amount of v(3 ) sites in the unit cell is @xmath57% .",
    "a larger number of weakly interacting curie - like 1/2-spins @xmath29% estimated from the analysis of the susceptibility ( fig .",
    "[ chit ] ) suggests that quasi - free spins are not confined to the interlayer v(3 ) sites only .",
    "the mixed valency of vanadium in vo@xmath3-nts results in a heterogeneous charge distribution in the zig - zag chains comprising the walls ( fig .",
    "[ structurevox ] ) . assuming that most of tetrahedral v(3 ) sites are magnetic ( @xmath58% ) and recalling that the eels data yield 40% of nonmagnetic v@xmath53 ions in the structure which",
    "thus should mostly reside in the chains , one finds almost equal number of spin- ( @xmath0 ) and spinless ( @xmath52 ) sites in the chains .",
    "thus , about a half of the sites in the chain are magnetic .",
    "recalling our estimate of the concentration of spins in dimers @xmath33% which all should reside in the chains , we obtain that those spins constitute there almost 2/3 of magnetic chain sites .",
    "hence , there is still a significant number of spins in the chains amounting to @xmath59 of all v sites in the unit cell , which are not coupled in dimers .",
    "if they were individual quasi - free spins , they would be expected to contribute to the curie - weiss susceptibility , similar to the v(3 ) interlayer sites .",
    "this would yield the total concentration of curie - like spins @xmath60 , which is almost twice as large as the experimentally determined value @xmath29% .",
    "therefore , this apparent discrepancy suggests that the remaining spins in the chain which are not involved in antiferromagnetic dimers are not independent but might form longer spin - chain fragments .",
    "indeed , it has been recently shown both theoretically and experimentally that the ground state configuration of a strongly hole - doped antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain is composed of spin chain fragments of different length , i.e. of spin dimeres , trimers and monomers ( individual spins ) etc.@xcite remarkably , for small external fields , trimers respond similarly to free spins at low temperatures ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "thus @xmath29% of curie - like spins estimated from our susceptibility data may comprise magnetic interlayer v(3 ) sites , i.e. quasi - free spins , as well as trimers in the v chain .    in case of antiferromagnetic trimers ,",
    "the number of magnetically active spins involved in the curie - like response is three times larger than for single spins , i.e. for a number of spins @xmath61 arranged in trimers only @xmath62 will be counted in @xmath56 . assuming that the remaining spins in the chains which are not involved in dimers , all form trimers , i.e. @xmath63% , one obtains a correct estimate of the total concentration of magnetic @xmath0 sites in the sample @xmath64% , which is in a good agreement with the eels data . to summarize",
    "the above discussion the approximate fractional weights of different spin species are depicted in the diagram in fig.[diagram ] .",
    "the above data analysis hence strongly suggests the occurrence in the v chains of spin - chain fragments of different lengths , i.e. individual spins , antiferromagnetic dimers and trimers .",
    "one might speculate if even longer fragments occur .",
    "the presence of chain fragments with an even number of sites , e.g. of quadrumers , however , can be ruled out by the experimental data : for quadrumers , one would expect the gap @xmath65k , @xcite which is not observed in our data .",
    "we also note , that the singlet - triplet excitation in the trimer occurs at @xmath66 which can not be investigated since the sample thermally degenerates at 370k .    -nts .",
    "( for details see the text ) ]    finally , we discuss the magnetization data at a low temperature @xmath41k ( fig.[mh ] ) which reveals a substantially different magnetic response as compared to the results at @xmath67k . in particular , the concentration of quasi - free spins , i.e. monomers ( individual spins ) or trimers , is strongly reduced down to 3% .",
    "this clearly indicates that most of the monomers / trimers are coupled antiferromagnetically at this temperature .",
    "this scenario is corroborated by the observation of a significant linear contribution @xmath68 to the @xmath42 vs. @xmath69 curve .",
    "the fact that @xmath70 is constant in the whole field range implies that the antiferromagnetic coupling of the monomers / trimers is larger than the energy @xmath71 of the applied field of 15 t .",
    "this scenario of antiferromagnetic coupling , however , does not straightforwardly explain the _ additional _ contribution to @xmath72 below @xmath37k ( cf .",
    "fig.[chis ] ) .",
    "one may speculate that anisotropic coupling mechanisms , like e.g. the dzyaloshinskii - moriya exchange , have to be considered .",
    "this requires , however , a detailed symmetry analysis of the exchange paths between vanadium spins in vo@xmath3-nts .      _ experiment . _",
    "the @xmath12v - nmr experiments were carried out in a field of 7.05  t in a temperature range 15 - 285k .",
    "@xmath12v nucleus has a spin @xmath73 and possesses a nuclear quadrupole moment .",
    "therefore it is sensitive to both , the magnetic degrees of freedom and to the charge environment .",
    "the nmr spectra were acquired by a point - by - point frequency sweeping . at each frequency point",
    "the signal has been obtained by a fourier transformation of the hahn spin echo @xmath74 with the pulse separation time @xmath75 .",
    "the final frequency - swept spectrum has been calculated by sequential summing of the signals at three successive frequency points . in fig.[spectrum ] a spectrum at @xmath76k is shown as an example .",
    "the spectrum is broadened due to a different orientation of nanotubes in a powder sample and contains several unresolved quadrupole satellites .",
    "the relaxation times @xmath77 and @xmath78 were measured at the frequency of the maximum intensity of the spectrum which was assigned to the main @xmath79 nmr transition .",
    "the transversal relaxation time @xmath77 has been determined from the hahn spin echo decay which can not be described by a single exponent . however it could be very well fitted assuming the two - exponential behavior with two distinctly different relaxation times . to measure the longitudinal relaxation time @xmath78",
    "a method of stimulated echo employing a pulse sequence @xmath80 with @xmath81 has been used .",
    "the time dependence of the stimulated spin echo intensity @xmath82 , which is a measure of the decay of the longitudinal magnetization characterized by the relaxation time @xmath78 , has been analyzed following the standard equation for the spin @xmath73 derived in ref .  .",
    "also in this case the decay of @xmath82 can not be described by a one - center fitting .",
    "the fit requires the presence of two contributions of different weights with distinctly different relaxation rates .",
    "thus for the following discussion it is useful to define the  fast  and the  slow  relaxation processes .",
    "the temperature dependence of the  fast  and  slow  transverse and longitudinal relaxation rates @xmath83 and @xmath13 is shown in fig.[rates ] .",
    "slow  contribution to @xmath83 is temperature independent whereas the  fast  one as well as both contributions to @xmath13 increase with increasing temperature .",
    "the ratio of the weights of these two contributions to the relaxation decay @xmath84 at @xmath76k is close to 2.4 .",
    "however the weight of the  slow  component strongly increases with decreasing temperature yielding @xmath85 at @xmath86k ( fig.[ratio ] ) .     and @xmath83 : ( a ) as a function of temperature ; ( b ) as a function of inverse temperature .",
    "dashed line denotes the expected behavior of @xmath13 according to eq .",
    "( [ spingap ] ) due to the opening of the spin gap @xmath87k . ]    _ discussion .",
    "_ as discussed in section  [ statmag ] vanadium ions in vo@xmath3-nts occur in different valence states and can be magnetic and nonmagnetic .",
    "the ions possessing an electronic magnetic moment produce a fluctuating magnetic field at the nuclei .",
    "it leads to a fast relaxation of the nuclei of the magnetic ions due to the on - site hyperfine interaction .",
    "the magnitude of the transferred hyperfine field at the nuclei of nonmagnetic ions is much smaller and the relaxation is more slow .",
    "the temperature independent  slow  component of @xmath83 can obviously be assigned to the conventional magnetic dipolar interaction ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . however with",
    "increasing temperature a more effective relaxation channel appears .",
    "the fact that the temperature dependence of the  fast  @xmath83 contribution is similar to that of the both components of @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ rates ] ) gives evidence that the origin of this contribution is the relaxation due to the fluctuating magnetic field produced by electron spins at the nuclei . in this case",
    "according to the redfield s theory @xcite @xmath13 and @xmath83 are determined by the magnitude of the transferred field @xmath88 ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) and the correlation time @xmath91 of the electron spins : @xmath92\\tau_0/(1+\\omega_n^2\\tau_0 ^ 2),\\\\ t_2^{-1}=\\gamma_n^2[\\overline{h_z^2}\\tau_0 + \\overline{h_y^2}\\tau_0/(1+\\omega_n^2\\tau_0 ^ 2)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath93 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath94 is the nmr frequency , respectively . in the regime of fast fluctuations , @xmath95 , which is expected far away from magnetically ordered phases , the observed strong increase of the relaxation rates with temperature ( fig .",
    "[ rates]a ) suggests the enhancement of @xmath88 at the positions of the nuclei owing to , e.g. , an increase of the concentration of the spin centers .",
    "moreover , the change of the ratio of the weight coefficients of two contributions to the relaxation decay @xmath84 with temperature ( fig .  [ ratio ] ) can be explained by taking into account the magnetic susceptibility data which indicate that part of magnetic ions form antiferromagnetic dimers and exhibit a spin gap behavior . usually owing to a spin gap",
    "the huge slowing down of relaxation with decreasing temperature is observed , as , e.g. in the case of the low - dimensional vanadium oxides , it has been observed in the nmr relaxation measurements of a two - leg spin - ladder cav@xmath6o@xmath96,@xcite or a quarter - filled ladder compound nav@xmath6o@xmath96.@xcite the occurrence of a spin gap @xmath39 yields an exponential temperature dependence of the longitudinal relaxation rate @xmath13 for @xmath97 : @xcite @xmath98 . \\label{spingap}\\ ] ] with the dimer gap @xmath35 k deduced from our magnetization data one would expect a strong decrease of the nuclear relaxation below 100k , which is not observed experimentally ( cf .",
    "fig.[rates ] ) .",
    "obviously , in our case this picture is disguised by the presence of nondimerized magnetic ions providing fast relaxation even at low temperature .",
    "these magnetic centers can be assigned to the interlayer v(3 ) sites as well as to trimers in the v chains ( see section  [ statmag ] ) .",
    "the nuclei in dimerized ions are slowly relaxing at low temperatures because of the non - magnetic singlet ground state of a dimer and fast relaxing at high temperatures owing to thermally activated singlet - triplet excitations across the dimer gap .",
    "hence the existence of a spin gap should be seen as a change of the weight coefficients of the respective @xmath13 contributions .",
    "moreover , thermal activation of dimers at high temperatures should effectively look like an increase of the concentration of magnetic centers .",
    "this should enhance the magnitude of the fluctuating magnetic field and the relaxation rate of the  slow - relaxing  nuclei .",
    "indeed , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] with increasing temperature the relaxation rate of the  slow  nuclei grows stronger than that of the  fast  ones .",
    "the common temperature dependence of the ratios of the weights and of the relaxation times of two contributions ( fig .  [ ratio ] ) justifies the same origin of both dependences which can be due to the occurrence of the spin gap for a part of magnetic vanadium ions .",
    "the weight coefficients at high temperatures provides the ratio of the fast and slow relaxing centers approximately as 70%:30% .",
    "this ratio is in a fair agreement with the eels estimation of the ratio between magnetic v@xmath10 and nonmagnetic v@xmath53 amounting to 60%:40%.@xcite therefore in the high temperature regime it is reasonable to associate the fast- and the slow - relaxing centers with v@xmath10 and v@xmath53 sites , respectively . from the weight ratio @xmath84 at low temperatures",
    "one obtains the number of  slow - relaxing ",
    "nuclei amounting to @xmath99 which comprises the nonmagnetic v@xmath53 sites as well as the dimerized centers .",
    "as the high - temperature nmr estimate of the v@xmath53 sites amounts to @xmath100 , the concentration of the magnetic @xmath0 v@xmath10 sites coupled in antiferromagnetic dimers is , therefore , about 30% of all vanadium , in a good agreement with the estimate @xmath33% from the static magnetization data ( section  [ statmag ] ) .",
    "the nmr estimate of the  fast - relaxing  , i.e. paramagnetic centers , at low temperatures yields @xmath101 which is significantly larger than the concentration of the curie - like spins @xmath102% obtained from the analysis of the curie - like susceptibility @xmath103 ( eq .  [ chicw ] ) .",
    "this apparent contradiction can be resolved if not only individual spins but also trimers would contribute to @xmath103 at low temperatures , as has been suggested in the analysis of the static magnetic data in section  [ statmag ] . assuming that the nuclei in a trimer belong to the  fast - relaxing ",
    "centers , owing to a magnetic ground state of a trimer , all @xmath61 sites involved in trimers will be counted in the weight of the respective contribution to the nmr relaxation rate @xmath13 , whereas effectively only @xmath62 of those sites is counted in @xmath104 .",
    "thus the analysis of the nmr data strongly supports the static magnetic results , both justifying the occurrence of comparable amounts of individual spins , antiferromagnetic dimers and trimers as depicted in fig.[diagram ] .",
    "in summary , magnetization and @xmath12v  nmr measurements of the samples of multiwalled vanadium - oxide nanotubes reveal a complex evolution of the static and dynamic magnetic properties as a function of temperature .",
