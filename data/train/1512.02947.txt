    "<S> backreaction in the cosmological context is a longstanding problem that is especially important in the present era of precise cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the standard model of a homogeneous background plus density perturbations is most probably oversimplified and is expected to fail to fully account for the near - future observations of sub - percent precision . from a theoretical point of view , the problem of backreaction is very complicated and deserves careful examination . </S>",
    "<S> recently , green and wald claimed in a series of papers to have developed a formalism to properly describe the influence of density inhomogeneities on average properties of the universe , i.e. , the backreaction effect </S>",
    "<S> . a brief discussion of this framework is presented , focussing on its drawbacks and on misconceptions that have arisen during the `` backreaction debate '' .     </S>",
    "<S> startsectionsection1@-10pt plus-3pt minus-6pt3pta brief history of the `` backreaction debate '' the subject of backreaction in cosmology has quite a long history , given that modern cosmology itself is a young discipline . in general , backreaction can be understood as the influence of density inhomogeneities on average properties of the universe that are usually described by the friedman  </S>",

    "<S> robertson  walker ( flrw ) metric , and in turn , their influence on light propagation and observables . </S>",
    "<S> several approaches have been developed to estimate the magnitude of backreaction , with a wide range of results , depending on the method used . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest effects are found in the perturbative regime , and the biggest for scalar averaging and for exact solutions . disregarding the issue of the magnitude of backreaction , </S>",
    "<S> most of the methods show that this effect may act like dark energy , i.e. , produce an effective large - scale expansion in addition to that of a strictly flrw model .    here , we focus on a particular framework proposed to address the problem of backreaction , the green and wald formalism , which reaches the opposite conclusions , i.e. , that backreaction is trace - free and can not mimic a dark energy component . </S>",
    "<S> this claim contradicts the results obtained by several different methods , and thus became a subject of debate which we refer to here as the `` backreaction debate '' .    </S>",
    "<S> key `` backreaction debate '' articles , for ( @xmath0 ) and against ( @xmath1 ) backreaction _ potentially _ being able to mimic dark energy , include the following :    @xmath1    = 0.5ex ishibashi and wald : _ `` can the acceleration of our universe be explained by the effects of inhomogeneities ? '' _ @xcite  the authors claim that backreaction is negligible based on the smallness of the derivatives of metric deviations .    the green and wald formalism : _ </S>",
    "<S> `` new framework for analyzing the effects of small scale inhomogeneities in cosmology '' _ @xcite  the authors claim to have developed a formalism for a mathematically rigorous treatment of backreaction , with surprising results : the only effect that the density inhomogeneities can have on the background dynamics is via gravitational radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> examples by green and wald : _ `` examples of backreaction of small - scale inhomogeneities in cosmology '' _ @xcite  the authors present two examples of their framework : a vacuum space  time , and a metric with an associated stress  </S>",
    "<S> energy tensor that violates the weak energy condition .    </S>",
    "<S> rebuttal by buchert et al . : _ </S>",
    "<S> `` is there proof that backreaction of inhomogeneities is irrelevant in cosmology ? '' _ @xcite </S>",
    "<S>  this paper presents a critical analysis of the green and wald formalism ;    response to the rebuttal , by green and wald : _ `` comments on backreaction '' _ @xcite  the authors reassert their main results from previous articles .    </S>",
    "<S> there is an important difference between the first and second of these articles . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , the authors use the arguments from standard perturbation theory , i.e. , that not only does the metric of the real universe barely deviate from the flrw metric , but its derivatives are also small . </S>",
    "<S> the same applies to stress  </S>",
    "<S> energy tensor perturbations , and the perturbed einstein equation reads @xmath2 this formulation has as an obvious limitation in describing our universe  we know that density perturbations are much greater than one in amplitude at recent epochs , on length scales well above those of `` black holes and neutron stars '' @xcite , implying  through the einstein equation  the importance of curvature ( i.e. , second derivatives of the metric ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as noted by green and wald in ref .  , there is no particular reason why the metric derivatives should also be small . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , the metric first derivatives are allowed to be large but finite , and no constraints are placed on the second derivatives ( in practice , however , for the formalism to give a non - zero result , specific constraints have to be put on the second derivatives @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , no constraints are made on the stress - energy tensor . </S>",
    "<S> all of these are desired features of a good backreaction model ; green and wald s effort to take these into account deserves credit . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , in our opinion , the authors failed to provide a physically valid general statement , as we outline below .     </S>",
    "<S> startsectionsection1@-10pt plus-3pt minus-6pt3ptthe green and wald formalism in this section we briefly describe the green and wald formalism ( see ref .   for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism is based on the existence of a @xmath3-dependent family of metrics @xmath4 on an arbitrary background manifold ( @xmath5 ) that are close to a background metric @xmath6 , and which converge to the latter point - wise as the scalar parameter @xmath3 approaches zero . </S>",

    "<S> green and wald examined an `` effective '' stress - energy tensor @xmath31 , inferring that :    @xmath31 is trace - less , i.e. @xmath32 ; [ t1 ]    @xmath31 obeys the weak energy condition i.e. @xmath33 [ t2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> to put it in words : @xmath31 can not mimic dark energy .     </S>",

    "<S> al @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> shortly after this appeared on the _ arxiv _ preprint server , green and wald published a response in which they uphold their previous statements . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , they clarify the domain of applicability of their formalism in relation to popular approaches to backreaction . in particular , green and wald state that their formalism does not apply to situations </S>",
    "<S> when :    * the actual metric ( e.g. , at recent epochs ) is far from flrw ; or * one wishes to construct an effective metric ( or other effective quantities ) through some averaging procedure    this , in principle , ends the debate about whether backreaction has been excluded as a dark energy candidate : the green and wald formalism does not apply to the main body of backreaction research ; backreaction remains a viable dark energy candidate . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly outline some characteristics that the formalism lacks .     </S>",
    "<S> startsectionsubsection2@-10pt plus-3pt minus-6pt2ptbackreaction without backreaction let us introduce a more precise definition of backreaction ( setting @xmath34 for simplicity ) . </S>",
    "<S> assume that we know the inhomogeneous metric describing the real universe and that we want to derive its averaged dynamical behaviour on a certain scale . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by applying a procedure such that by smoothing over larger and larger scales of inhomogeneities , we end up with a background metric ( on a scale that we accept as homogeneous ) . however , to construct the einstein tensor , and thus to describe the averaged dynamics , we need not only the metric but also the metric derivatives and products of derivatives . in general , averaging and differentiating or taking products of derivatives are non - commuting operations @xcite . thus , while it is trivially true that , provided that an averaging procedure @xmath35 is properly defined , @xmath36 , we can not expect that @xmath37 backreaction ( @xmath38 ) is then the term compensating the discrepancies coming from this non - commutativity : @xmath39 this term should , in principle , be present at each intermediate scale between a small scale and the homogeneous scale .    </S>",
    "<S> let us take a look at ( [ eq - gw - assump - i ] ) , i.e. green and wald s assumption ( i ) , which becomes @xmath40 which we can treat , from the lack of any other options , as a definition of the @xmath3-dependent family of stress  energy tensors . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that for some @xmath7 , @xmath10 is smoother than the inhomogeneous , unsmoothed stress - energy tensor @xmath41 , thanks to an averaging procedure . </S>",
    "<S> then a backreaction term @xmath42 must appear in the @xmath3-dependent einstein equation , due to the non - commutativity of averaging ( [ e - tau - backreaction ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> but this contradicts ( [ eq - gw - assump - i - lambda - zero ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the green and wald formalism , the only averaging allowed for @xmath7 is exactly commutative averaging ( @xmath43 ) , and a backreaction term @xmath44 suddenly blips on at @xmath45 , discontinuously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is difficult to find a physically meaningful interpretation of this limiting procedure .     </S>",
    "<S> startsectionsubsection2@-10pt plus-3pt minus-6pt2ptaveraging without averaging there is no overall agreement on a physically meaningful way to average the einstein equation . </S>",
    "<S> one can quite quickly run into conceptual problems trying to perform averaging of fields on manifolds in a unique and gauge - independent way . in their formalism , green and wald bypass these difficulties by being very general , and yet they are able to extract some crucial features of averaged equations . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the averaging operator is played by the weak limit specified up to some arbitrary well - behaving test tensor field used to contract the averaged quantities . according to green and wald , </S>",
    "<S> the action of the weak limit can be interpreted as follows ( @xcite ) : `` _ roughly speaking , the weak limit performs a local space - time average of @xmath46 before letting @xmath47 _ '' , where @xmath46 is a one - parameter family of tensor fields . for this to be non - trivial , the limit operator and the integral can not commute : @xmath48 , since otherwise </S>",
    "<S> , the averaging would be performed on the background value of the tensor field and the integration would become redundant for the homogeneous background .    r0.5     however , for a fixed domain of integration , fulfilling this requirement of non - commutativity requires breaking one of the dominant convergence theorem assumptions ( e.g. , figure  [ f1 ] ) . indeed , in the examples provided by green and wald , the derivatives and the products of derivatives , while being continuous in the space  time coordinates , do not have pointwise limits as @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ f1 ] shows the behaviour of a toy model @xmath50 ( analogous to the usual density @xmath51 that relates to the second derivatives of the metric via the einstein equation ) , where @xmath52 approaches zero pointwise , while @xmath51 is @xmath3-discontinuous ( it does not have a pointwise limit ) . instead of successive coarse - graining </S>",
    "<S> , the density profile approaches homogeneity by a _ </S>",
    "<S> fine_-graining process , which is the opposite of what we would expect from an averaging procedure . </S>",
    "<S> ( in contrast , gw s procedure _ does _ have features likely to be relevant to gravitational radiation . )    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , integrating by parts , we have ( e.g. for @xmath53 ) : @xmath54 thus , the apparently non - local integration of derivatives in gw s procedure reduces to pointwise operations ; it misses generic features of averaging : non - locality and scale - dependence .     </S>",
    "<S> startsectionsection1@-10pt plus-3pt minus-6pt3ptconclusions the green and wald formalism is not mathematically general  see ref .   for the hidden assumptions  and its physical interpretation is far from obvious . </S>",
    "<S> an unaware reader might be tempted to think that mathematically general arguments against common approaches to backreaction ( e.g. , exact inhomogeneous cosmological solutions or the buchert equations ) were presented , but this is not the case . </S>"
