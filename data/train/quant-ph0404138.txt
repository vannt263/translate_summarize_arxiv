    "it is well - known that light may carry both angular and linear momentum .",
    "when a light field interacts with matter , exchange of momentum and angular momentum between light and matter can occur .",
    "laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) light modes are known to carry orbital angular momentum .",
    "if one employs the paraxial approximation for the light field , simple expressions for the field amplitudes and its average angular momentum can be derived @xcite .",
    "an easy way to produce such beams is using spiral phase plates @xcite .",
    "another important question is the separability of the total angular momentum into orbital and spin parts @xcite .",
    "the orbital part is associated with the phase distribution of the light field , and the spin part is connected with its polarization .",
    "this question is essential in the context of momentum transfer from light to the atom when one includes atomic internal degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been shown that spin and orbital angular momentum of the photon are transferred from the quantized light field to , respectively , the internal and the external angular momentum of the atom .",
    "the interaction with a lg mode is a possible way to entangle internal and external degrees of freedom of an atom @xcite .",
    "the transfer of the angular momentum of light to particles has been also experimentally demonstrated in @xcite , where trapped massive particles are set into rotation while interacting with the light field .",
    "other authors have studied the cooling properties for atoms using lg beams @xcite .",
    "also lg beams have been proposed as a @xmath0 trapping potential for bose condensates @xcite .    whereas angular momentum exchange between light and matter is a relatively new topic , the linear momentum exchange is a well - established issue @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that two counterpropagating waves lead to a more efficient exchange of linear momentum between an atom and the light field than a single travelling wave . using quantum language for a classical light field",
    ", one can describe such an interaction as a sequence of successive single photon absorption and emission events .",
    "this suggests that one may expect more efficient angular momentum exchange between a light field and an atom if one uses two lg modes with opposite helicity , e.g. counterrotating waves .",
    "we start with radiation fields propagating along the @xmath1-axis with wave number @xmath2 and carrying orbital angular momentum ( laguerre - gaussian beams ) .",
    "if one considers the paraxial limit of these waves , the expressions for the light fields are particularly simple @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the cylindrical coordinates , @xmath5 is the frequency and the integer index @xmath6 is indicates the helicity of the lg beam . for two laguerre - gaussian beams with opposite helicity , namely @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ", the total field can be written as @xmath8 we indicated already in the introduction , that one expects a more efficient exchange of angular momentum between the light field and the atom in the configuration ( [ standing lg ] ) than in a single lg mode .",
    "this expectation is based on the corresponding situation of momentum exchange between an atom and a standing light wave .",
    "in addition to the light field ( [ standing lg ] ) , the atomic motion in the radial direction is assumed to be confined by an extra trapping potential @xmath9 with cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the @xmath10dependence of the amplitude @xmath11 is slow and can be ignored . properly shaping the lg mode , the radial dependence of @xmath12",
    "can be ignored on the characteristic width of the trapping potential @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath13 is constant . for a two - level atom the hamiltonian in the rotating - wave approximation",
    "can then be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the rabi frequency of each of the travelling waves that create the standing wave , @xmath5 is the laser frequency , and @xmath16 is the hamiltonian for a free atom , with @xmath17 the momentum operator of the atom , @xmath18 and @xmath19 indicate the ground and excited states , and @xmath20 defines the transition frequency of a free atom .",
    "the dynamics of the atom is rather simple if the laser is far detuned .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 where the detuning @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 for an atom in the ground state , the excited state can be adiabatically eliminated , which leads to an effective hamiltonian in the well - known form @xmath24 where the light - shift potential is specified by @xmath25 with @xmath26",
    "some general conclusions on the bound states of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_far ] ) directly follow from its symmetry properties .",
    "we introduce the unitary translation operator @xmath27 defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 indicates the states with fixed azimuthal angle . since the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_far ] ) is invariant for rotation about an angle @xmath30 , it follows from a rotational version of the bloch theorem that the eigenstates of this hamiltonian are also eigenstates of @xmath27 .",
    "the eigenvalue relation can be expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is referred to as angular quasimomentum and @xmath33 identifies the energy band .",
    "we consider a single energy band , and we suppress the index @xmath33 .",
    "we can restrict @xmath32 to the first brillouin zone given as @xmath34 the eigenstates @xmath35 should be periodic in @xmath36 with period @xmath37 , because a rotation over @xmath37 must leave the wave function invariant@xmath38 the finite range of @xmath39 leads to a discretization of angular quasimomentum . on the other hand , a rotation over @xmath37 is equivalent to the action of the operator @xmath40 .",
    "since it follows from eq .",
    "( [ quasimomentum ] ) that @xmath41 we conclude that the only possible values of the angular quasimomentum are determined from the condition @xmath42 hence @xmath32 must be integer , and each band contains @xmath43 bloch states .",
    "for example , for @xmath44 the first brillouin zone contains only the four values @xmath45 of the angular quasimomentum .",
    "also , in analogy to the case of an infinite linear lattice , one can introduce localized wannier states @xmath46 in the usual manner , as fourier transforms of the bloch states @xmath47 obviously , the number of wannier states within an energy band is equal to @xmath48 , just as the number of bloch states .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot the trapping potential ( [ trapping_pot ] ) @xmath49 for @xmath50 in cartesian coordinates .",
    "when the potential is sufficiently deep , atoms can be bound in the angular wells , and the wannier states are confined to a single well .",
    "an additional confining potential @xmath51 is required to trap particles in the radial direction , and to avoid their escape .",
    "then the potential ( [ trapping_pot ] ) can create a circular lattice , where particles are located near the minima of the periodic potential .",
    "a circular optical lattice has many applications , as discussed recently by several authors @xcite .",
    "since the potentials have a cylindrical symmetry , it is convenient to express the kinetic energy in cylindrical coordinates , and we write @xmath52 the dynamics along the @xmath1 axis is completely free . for simplicity , we assume that the radial potential @xmath51 is narrow , so that the radial motion is restricted to a ring with radius @xmath53 , and we ignore radial dispersion in the present section .",
    "we return to it in sec .",
    "vi , where the effect of the radial dispersion is estimated . the motion of an atom in the angular direction is then described by the one - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath54 which has the azimuthal angle as the only coordinate .",
    "the quantity @xmath55 is the moment of inertia .",
    "this hamiltonian is the circular counterpart of the hamiltonian for simple linear diffraction .",
    "the main difference is that the coordinate @xmath39 is periodic , which forces the angular wave number @xmath6 to be integer .",
    "diffraction of a single atom described by such a linear hamiltonian has been extensively studied theoretically and experimentally by several groups @xcite .    just as is usually done for linear diffraction",
    ", we consider the situation that an initially localized atom interacts with the optical potential during a small interaction interval @xmath56 $ ] , where the atom picks up momentum from the lattice .",
    "the transition from the near field immediately after the interaction and the far field is described by free evolution .",
    "we assume the atom to be initially in its ground state and situated in a small segment of the ring . since the angular wave function @xmath57 of the atom must be periodic at all times",
    ", we can not represent a localized wave packet by a gaussian .",
    "the initial state at the beginning of the interaction interval is taken as @xmath58 with @xmath59 to be a large natural number , and @xmath60 is the normalization constant @xmath61 the state ( [ psi(0 ) ] ) can be written as a fourier series , which is just an expansion in the angular - momentum eigenstates .",
    "this gives @xmath62 with @xmath63 the initial state ( [ psi(0 ) ] ) is localized around @xmath64 , which is clear from the asymptotic form @xmath65 for large @xmath59 .",
    "the half width in the azimuthal angle is of the order of @xmath66 . from the asymptotic form of the binomial coefficient @xmath67 we find the asymptotic expression of the fourier coefficient @xmath68",
    "this demonstrates that the half width in angular momentum is of the order of @xmath69 .",
    "if we take the duration @xmath70 of the light pulse short and the moment of inertia @xmath71 is large , so that @xmath72 , no propagation occurs , and the kinetic - energy term can be neglected during the interaction .",
    "this is the equivalence of the standard raman - nath approximation applied by cook et al @xcite .",
    "then the final state at time @xmath73 after the interaction is @xmath74 this state can be expressed as an expansion in angular - momentum eigenstates , in the form fourier series , which is just an expansion in the angular - momentum eigenstates .",
    "this gives @xmath75 where @xmath76 in terms of the ordinary bessel functions .",
    "states with large angular momentum @xmath77 are initially not populated , whereas all angular momentum states get populated after the interaction .",
    "thus , the configuration with two lg modes leads to more efficient exchange between the light field and the atom than a single lg beam .",
    "the physical interpretation is the same as for diffraction in the field of classical counterpropagating waves : an atom picks up a photon from the light beam with one helicity and emits a photon into the opposite one . in figure 2",
    "we present a typical diffraction pattern calculated for the case that @xmath78 more precisely , we plot the angular - momentum coefficients @xmath79 before the interaction , and the coefficients @xmath80 after the interaction with the circular lattice , for @xmath81 in the latter case , the momentum peaks correspond to different values of @xmath82 .",
    "the distance between neighboring peaks is equal to @xmath43 .",
    "the half width of each peak is of the order of @xmath83",
    "as shown above , the angular - momentum distribution of an atom after the interaction with a pair of counterrotating lg beams can be broad .",
    "however , as a result of the raman - nath approximation , the angular distribution of the atom has not been modified during the interaction , so that @xmath84 . in this chapter",
    "we investigate the spatial form of the atomic distribution in the far field , i. e. after free evolution of the atom over the ring .",
    "as before , the motion along the @xmath1 axis is completely free and the radial motion is restricted on a ring .",
    "the initial state of this free evolution is given by eq .",
    "( [ wave_function ] ) , with the expansion in angular - momentum states given by eqs .",
    "( [ ampl_momentum0 ] ) and ( [ am ] ) . for positive times , the atomic motion is still restricted to the ring with radius @xmath53 by the confining potential @xmath51 , and the evolution of the angular wave function @xmath57 is governed by the hamiltonian ( [ ham_azimuthal ] ) with @xmath85 . with the initial state ( [ ampl_momentum0 ] ) , the time - dependent wave function is given by the expansion @xmath86 where @xmath87 , and the coefficients @xmath88 are given in eq .",
    "( [ am ] ) . as displayed in fig .",
    "2 , the distribution @xmath89 typically separates in a number of peaks centered at @xmath90 , where @xmath91 @xmath92which are separated by @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the superposition state ( [ ampl_free ] ) can be considered as a series of elementary wave packets centered at @xmath94 in the angular - momentum space .",
    "each of these peaks gives a separate contribution to the wave function that moves with its own angular group velocity @xmath95 .",
    "the angular separation between neighboring wavepackets is given by @xmath96 , which is proportional to @xmath97 since wave packets with opposite angular - momentum values will move in opposite directions , i. e. clockwise and anticlockwise , they will eventually meet again at some time @xmath98 and start to interfere .    in order to estimate the time value that interference sets in",
    ", we use the fact that for not too small arguments @xmath99 the bessel function @xmath100 with the maximal value is the one with @xmath101 .",
    "hence , the meeting time of the pair of the strongest counterpropagating packets is @xmath102    the exact expression for the time - dependent wave function can be expressed in an integral form by using the mathematical identity @xcite @xmath103 , \\label{math_rel}\\ ] ] which can be checked by performing the integration . when substituting this identity in the right - hand side of eq .",

    "it is crucial that the integration be performed over all values of @xmath105 , while using that the wave function @xmath106 is periodic .",

    "the fourier transform of the initial state determines not only the momentum wave function , but also the asymptotic form of the coordinate wave function , scaled by a factor that varies linearly with time .",
    "characteristic for the present case of evolution on a circle is that each interval of length @xmath37 serves as a separate source , each giving a contribution to @xmath122 .",
    "since the fourier transform of the wave function determines the angular - momentum amplitudes , we may conclude that the wave function for not too small times has the same form as the initial distribution of angular momentum , scaled by the factor @xmath123 .",

    "one notices that the counterrotating components give rise to clear interference fringes",
    ". these fringes will be quite sensitive to any perturbation in one of the arms .",
    "this suggests to use the present scheme as an atomic interferometer @xcite .",
    "usually , interferometers have two key components , namely a beam splitter and a mirror . a coherent incoming atomic beam is split into spatially separated components by the beam splitter .",
    "two arms are getting formed , which freely propagate and may undergo different phase shifts , which are probed by recombining the two arms .",
    "the interference pattern contains the information of the phase perturbation in one of the arms .",
    "recombination usually requires atomic mirrors . in atom optics , beam splitters and mirrors",

    ", only a single pulse is required that splits the initial atomic wave packet into components rotating to the left and to the right .",
    "no mirrors are employed in this scheme .",
    "instead , one uses the radial potential @xmath132 , to constrain the atomic motion to a ring .",
    "radial potentials can be realized by hollow light beams , which are widely used in atomic interferometric schemes .",
    "in this chapter we consider the radial dynamics of the diffracted wave function during its free evolution , after the passage of the circular lattice .",
    "we assume that the wave function at time @xmath133 , after the diffracting pulse , is factorized as @xmath134 where the radial part @xmath135 of the wave function is sharply peaked at @xmath136 , and the angular wave function is specified by eq .",

    "so just as discussed in sec .",
    "iv , the angular distribution separates in different wave packets that are counterrotating .",

    "the average radius displays oscillations , which can be understood as arising from the outward motion due to the centrifugal potential , followed by reflection at the hard wall of the cylinder .",

    "the revival of the oscillation can be understood from the discrete nature of the contributing energy eigenvalues , when the phase factors due to neighboring eigenenergies have built up a phase difference @xmath37 . because of the conservation of angular momentum , the probability density near the origin remains zero .",
    "the interference between the counterrotating wave packets is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , for the ring at radius @xmath171 .",
    "6a shows the short - time separation of the angular wave packets .",
    "6b displays the interference that arises as soon as overlap occurs around @xmath172 between the clockwise and the anti - clockwise rotating packets .",
    "this demonstrates that the radial wave functions @xmath173 for different values of @xmath145 have sufficient overlap , so that the angular interference survives the effect of radial dispersion .",
    "in this paper we describe the diffraction of an atomic wave by a circular optical lattice .",
    "such a lattice can be formed by the superposition of two laguerre - gaussian beams with opposite helicity , which gives rise to a standing wave in the angular direction .",
    "such a light field will split a single localized atom into clockwise and anticlockwise rotating components . if the system is in a trapping potential in the form of a ring or in a cylindrical box , these counterrotating components give rise to interference .",
