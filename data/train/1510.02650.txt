    "when @xmath0 is a lie group and @xmath5 is a closed subgroup of @xmath0 , one can use the linear action of @xmath5 on the vector space @xmath6 to define a new lie group @xmath7 @xmath1 the semidirect product @xmath8 .",
    "this group is known as the contraction of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath5 , and it is famous in mathematical physics : the poincar group of special relativity admits as a contraction the galilei group of classical inertial changes , and it is itself a contraction of the de sitter group which appears in general relativity .",
    "+ since the unitary irreducible representations of the poincar group are well - known to yield particle state spaces for quantum physics , it is quite natural to wonder whether there is a relationship between the representation theories of @xmath0 and @xmath7 . for",
    "most lie groups , including the poincar group , unitary representations do not behave well under the contraction : in general the parameters needed to identify representations of @xmath0 and @xmath7 are rather different , and this is important for physics @xmath1 a consequence of the bad behaviour in the case of the poincar group is that the notion of ( rest ) mass has different meanings in special and galilean relativity .   + in 1975 however , george mackey - who had single - handedly developed the representation theory of semidirect products like @xmath7 in the 1950s - noticed that in the special case where @xmath0 is a semisimple lie group and @xmath5 is a maximal compact subgroup of @xmath0 , there is a coincidence between the parameters needed to describe rather large ] subsets of the unitary duals of @xmath0 and @xmath7 , and some analogies in the way to build these subsets . in this case , @xmath2 is often called the cartan motion group of @xmath0 : it acts through rigid motions on the flat symmetric space @xmath9 , while @xmath0 is the isometry group of the negatively curved @xmath10 .",
    "+ it is rather surprising that there should be a deep analogy between the representation theories of these two groups , and not only because the algebraic structures of @xmath0 and @xmath7 are very different .",
    "when @xmath11 is a lie group , let us write @xmath12 for its reduced ( ! ) unitary dual - gathering the equivalence classes of unitary irreducible representations which are weakly contained in the regular representation ; mackey s theorems then make the description of @xmath13 quite accessible , while describing @xmath14 is a formidable task which took all of harish - chandra s talent and energy .",
    "mackey nevertheless went on to conjecture that there should be a natural one - to - one correspondence between large enough subsets of @xmath14 and @xmath13 :   +    _ in view of the facts outlined above for @xmath15 it is natural to wonder to what extent one can find a correspondence between `` most '' of the irreducible representations of @xmath0 and those of the semidirect product @xmath2 . _",
    "+    the groups @xmath0 and @xmath7 fit into a continuous one - parameter family ( see section 2 ) , and in 1985 dooley and rice proved @xcite that the operators for principal series representations of @xmath0 do weakly converge , as the contraction is performed , to operators for a generic representation of @xmath2 ( i discuss some of their results in section 4 ) . although the initial reactions to mackey s ideas seem to have been rather skeptical , an interest in mackey s suggestions later sprang from the deformation theory of @xmath16-algebras : as baum , connes and higson pointed out in @xcite , the baum - connes conjecture for @xmath0 ( in its  smooth \" version due to connes and kasparov , proved by wasserman since then ) is a precise counterpart to mackey s analogy at the level of cohomology .   + but the interest for mackey s proposal seems to have waned since then , and it is scarcely @xmath1 if at all @xmath1 mentioned in the recent representation - theoretic literature ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "one of the reasons for the subject not having been pursued further , even after the mentioned developments in operator algebras , may be the fact that at the level of representation spaces , for the deeper strata of the unitary duals ( as one moves away from the principal series of @xmath0 or the generic representations of @xmath7 ) , the analogy seems doomed to be rather poor : for instance , there are unitary irreducible representations of @xmath2 whose carrier spaces are finite - dimensional , while all unitary irreducible representations of @xmath0 are infinite - dimensional ( the trivial one excepted ) .",
    "thus , as mackey says ,    _ above all [ the analogy ] is a mere coincidence of parametrizations , with no evident relationship between the constructions of corresponding representations .",
    "_    however , nigel higson recently revived the subject @xcite , starting back from the connes - kasparov conjecture and showing that a precise elaboration on mackey s ideas leads to new proofs of the conjecture : the @xmath16-algebra point of view involves shifting the attention from the representation spaces to their matrix coefficients , and higson noticed that when @xmath0 is complex semisimple , there is a deep , though not obvious , analogy between the structure of reduced @xmath16-algebras of @xmath0 and @xmath2 : they turn out to be assembled from identical building blocks , and fit into a continous field to @xmath2 which , from section 2 onwards , will play a key role in these notes . ] which turns out to be assembled from constant fields through morita equivalences , extensions and direct limits .",
    "he also made the important side observation that while mackey s suggestions treated the unitary dual as a borel space , the @xmath5-theory in the connes - kasparov phenomenon treats it as a topological space , and there is no natural way to relate these two points of view .",
    "this suggests that mackey s analogy should extend to the full tempered dual of @xmath0 , yielding an interesting bijection between @xmath17 and all of @xmath14 ; this i will take up in section 3 below .",
    "+ in these notes , my aim is to consider mackey s proposal from a rather naive perspective : i will start with spaces realizing elements of @xmath14 and try to describe what happens to the ( smooth , k - finite ) vectors as one proceeds to the contraction .",
    "my hope is to give in this way a somewhat simpler picture than is usual for the relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath18 , and to try to understand why the various strata in the unitary duals behave very differently .",
    "+ as we shall see , the part of mackey s analogy which relates spherical principal series representations of @xmath0 to generic class - one representations of @xmath7 can be rephrased as transferring harmonic analysis on a symmetric space of the noncompact type to classical fourier analysis on its ( euclidean ) tangent space at a given point .",
    "this is a much - studied problem with beautiful ramifications @xcite , and higson s account of the connes - kasparov phenomenon shows that bringing mackey s point of view into the picture is not at all devoid of interest in this case .",
    "+ now at the other end of the tempered spectrum , if @xmath0 has discrete series representations , mackey s proposal is that we should relate them to irreducible representations of @xmath5 ; what makes this reasonable is the fact that a discrete series representation has a unique minimal k - type .",
    "if @xmath7 is to be brought into the picture here , my task is then to understand how its minimal k - type can emerge from a discrete series representation as the contraction from @xmath0 to @xmath7 is performed .",
    "+ the methods i will use here are not original in any way : on the contrary , i will try to take full advantage of the geometric realizations of unitary representations of @xmath0 which were set forth in the years immediately following mackey s proposal .",
    "these realizations provide natural topologies , defined on ( dense subsets of ) the hilbert spaces , that are different from the hilbert space norm : at least for principal series and discrete series representations , the smooth vectors in the hilbert spaces for tempered representations of @xmath0 can be seen as functions on , or sections of homogeneous bundles on , the symmetric space g / k . in these notes",
    "i will trace mackey s analogy to phenomena which are invisible to the hilbert space topology , but become obvious when the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of @xmath10 comes in .   + here",
    "is an outline of my notes .",
    "i will start with a description of the cartan motion group , its unitary dual , and some aspects of the contraction from @xmath0 to @xmath2 in section 2 .",
    "after these preliminaries , i will write down a bijection between @xmath14 and @xmath13 ; for this extension of higson s analysis in the complex case , the main tool is vogan s minimal k - type parametrization of the tempered irreducible representations of @xmath0 which have real infinitesimal character . from section 3.3 onwards",
    "i focus on individual representation spaces , pursuing evidence for a phenomenon described in section 3.3 and summarized as theorem 3.4 there .",
    "sections 4 and 5 examine what happens in the case of the spherical principal series representations and the discrete series representations , respectively : both start with a presentation of the geometric realizations i will use , then watch a vector evolve as one proceeds to the contraction from @xmath0 to @xmath2 .",
    "since the full tempered dual of @xmath0 can be in some sense assembled from the discrete series of reductive subgroups , i then use the results on the discrete series and the ideas ( and lemmas ) of the spherical principal case to work out the general case in sections 6 ( real infinitesimal character ) and 7 ( general case ) .",
