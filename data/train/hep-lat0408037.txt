    "precise determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements from the b , d , and k decays is one of the major goals in flavor physics . by measuring both the sides and the angles of the unitarity triangle",
    ", one can test the consistency of the standard model , which can either verify the standard model or probe a signal of new physics .",
    "although useful for the consistency check against @xmath3 , the ckm matrix element @xmath0 is one of the most poorly known quantities at present . it would be important to reduce the uncertainties further .",
    "there are two ways to determine @xmath0 , i.e. the determination from the inclusive semileptonic decay @xmath4 , and the determination from the exclusive semileptonic decay @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "since both methods suffers from different systematic errors from the experiment and the theory , having independent results from the inclusive and the exclusive processes are necessary for the reliable determination of @xmath0 .    in the former method ,",
    "the hadronic matrix element in the inclusive process is the operator product expansion ( ope ) in @xmath7 .",
    "it is suggested by bauer _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that with an appropriate choice of the combined kinematical cut ( @xmath8 and @xmath1 ) to remove the charm background , theoretical errors from various higher order corrections in ope are controlled so that @xmath0 can be determined at the level of around 10% or below .",
    "the latter method requires the computations of the form factors which describe the hadronic weak matrix elements for the exclusive processes .",
    "lattice qcd is a promising tool for this purpose .",
    "however at large recoil , the cutoff effects of order @xmath9 becomes non negligible where @xmath10 is the lattice spacing and @xmath11 is the recoil energy of the daughter mesons such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "therefore the precise computation of the form factor is limited only for large @xmath1 region in the lattice qcd method .",
    "although b factory experiments can measure the differential decay rate at high @xmath1 regime , they are statistically limited while the rich experimental data for the low @xmath1 region will remain untouched",
    ". it would be ideal if one could make a precise prediction of the semileptonic decay form factors for the whole @xmath1 range .",
    "lellouch proposed a statistical method in which one uses the form factor values with theoretical errors for @xmath5 at high @xmath1 from lattice qcd to give a distribution of the dispersive bound for the form factors for the small @xmath1 region  @xcite .",
    "although the idea is attractive , with his original idea one could only obtain a loose bound for the form factor .",
    "later several authors pointed out that this bound can be improved with additional inputs near @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "recently cleo gave the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath5 decay  @xcite .",
    "although the overall normalization for the form factor is unknown up to @xmath0 , the cleo results give a strong constraint on the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath5 form factor . in this paper",
    ", we propose to use the information on the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath5 from the experiment to restrict the statistical distribution of the dispersive bound .",
    "we show that this additional input leads to a better determination of @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in [ sec : basic ] , we explain our basic idea for @xmath0 for determination using lattice data , dispersive bounds , and the experimental data .",
    "the explicit method how to combine those data explained in detail in section  [ sec : method ] . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] , our results on the improved bound for the form factor as well as @xmath0 are presented . in section  [ sec : errors ] , we discuss the systematic errors .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the appendix is devoted to a review of dispersive bound .",
    "the matrix element of the heavy - to - light semileptonic decay @xmath2 is parameterized as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath1 ranges from @xmath17 gev@xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the differential decay rate is written as @xmath20^{3/2 }     |f^+(q^2)|^2.\\ ] ]    since the discretization error becomes uncontrollable for the momentum much larger than @xmath21 , the calculation of the form factors is feasible only in the large @xmath1 ( small recoil ) region ( @xmath22 16  gev@xmath18 ) , where the spatial momentum of pion is lower than roughly 1  gev .",
    "the ckm matrix element @xmath0 can be obtained by combining the experimental data integrated above some @xmath1 value , and the lattice results for the form factor @xmath23 integrated in the same region with an appropriate kinematical factor . however , due to the limited statistics the experimental measurement for this energy range still has a large error .",
    "although in principle there is nothing wrong with this method , one disadvantage is that the experimental data for the rest of the kinematic range with much better statistics can not be used .",
    "an alternative way is to extrapolate the form factor to all kinematic range and combine with the full experimental data . for this purpose , we need to have the following three ingredients    1 .",
    "the experimental data of the partial decay rate @xmath24 for the kinematic ranges @xmath25 , 2 .   the lattice results on the form factor @xmath26 for large @xmath1 region , 3 .   a reliable method to extrapolate the form factor to lower @xmath1 region .",
    "in order to avoid model dependences , we exploit the dispersive bound to extrapolate the form factor .",
    "the dispersive bound is an exact bound on the form factors @xmath27 and @xmath26 for all kinematic range of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this is derived from the dispersion relation and the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the two - point correlation function of the heavy - light ( bu ) current in deep euclidean region .",
    "if we have an additional information on the form factors @xmath28 at some physical kinematic points @xmath29 ( from the lattice calculation , for instance ) , the bound can be improved further . in this case , the upper and the lower bounds are the solutions of the quadratic equations whose coefficients are determined by the lattice inputs as well as other inputs such as ope results . for a set of lattice data @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the upper and lower bounds are uniquely determined as a function of @xmath1 as long as the solution of the quadratic equation exists .",
    "let us denote the bounds as @xmath33     for one example set of inputs @xmath34,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +   for one example set of inputs @xmath34,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    the top figure shows the independent bounds for @xmath35 and @xmath36 and the bottom figure shows the bounds with the kinematical constraint @xmath37 [ fig : disp_no_error ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : disp_no_error ] shows a typical shape of the dispersive bound using a mock data and it is suggested that the inputs at three points could give rather stringent constraints .",
    "one problem is that in practice the additional inputs from the lattice calculation always has some theoretical errors so that this bound has uncertainties .",
    "lellouch proposed a statistical treatment and derived a probability distribution the dispersive bound  @xcite .",
    "he made a random sample set of form factors which obey the gaussian distributions where the central value and the deviations are taken from the central values and the error of the lattice data .",
    "for each sample set , the quadratic equations which determine the upper and lower bounds are solved .",
    "he imposed the following condition ,     condition a : :    ( consistency condition ) :    +    * the quadratic equations to determine the upper / lower bounds should    have real solutions .    *",
    "the solutions of the upper / lower bounds should allow the kinematical    condition @xmath37 .",
    "the sample is accepted when condition a is satisfied and discarded otherwise .",
    "then he makes a distributions of the upper and lower bounds from only the accepted solution , which are conditional distributions .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp_cl ] , the confidence level bound at @xmath38 and @xmath39 has a huge spread .",
    "although the dispersive bound method gives bounds at certain confidence levels , they are not strong enough to constrain the ckm matrix element @xmath0 with high accuracy .    in the following",
    "we would like to consider how to make the best use of the experimental data and the theoretical results .",
    "the large width of the dispersive bound arises because the statistical bound was obtained at each @xmath1 without considering the correlation in @xmath1 .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , each sample of the dispersive bound from the monte carlo sample based on the lattice data gives a very stringent bound and the @xmath1 dependence can be obtained with , say , 10% accuracy . on the other hand , from cleo experiment we also know the @xmath1 dependence up to an overall normalization from unknown factor @xmath0 .",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath1 dependence of the form factors from both the theory and experiment can be an additional input for the determination of @xmath0 . to extract @xmath0 , instead of combining the experimental data and the lattice results for a single @xmath1 bin",
    ", we make a kind of simultaneous fit for all the @xmath1 bins . precisely speaking ,",
    "since the lattice results are transformed into the distributions of the upper and lower bounds , a little modifications are necessary , namely rather than fitting @xmath0 we obtain a conditional distributions of @xmath0 using all information from the experimental and the lattice results . in other words , we can reweight the statistical distribution of the form factor bounds using the @xmath1 distribution from the experiment as an additional input , which we will explain more in detail in the next section",
    ".    we also note that the soft pion theorem can also be used for additional inputs .",
    "the soft pion predicts that the form factor near the zero pion recoil limit ( @xmath40 ) , the form factor behaves as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 coupling and @xmath44 are the decay constants of @xmath45 and @xmath46 mesons  @xcite .",
    "therefore provided that @xmath42 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are known , the soft pion relation can be used to gives additional inputs of the form factor at @xmath14 for the dispersive bounds .",
    "in the previous section , we explained the basic idea for extracting the ckm element @xmath0 by combing the lattice results , experimental data , and the dispersive bound . in this section",
    "we explain our method more in detail .    due to",
    "limited statistics and limited energy resolution in @xmath1 etc , usually the whole kinematic range is divided into @xmath49 bins ( @xmath50 ) and we only know the partial decay rates for those @xmath1 bins @xmath51 this partial decay rates are indeed measured by cleo collaboration  @xcite .    by integrating the dispersive bounds of the form factor @xmath52 , we can predict the upper and lower bounds of the partial decay rate over certain @xmath1 bins up to the overall factor @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 where the theoretical upper / lower bounds of the partial decay rates are latexmath:[$\\gamma^{up",
    "/ lo}_i({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ f$}})=     let us now explain our methods , which is composed of five steps .    1 .",
    "we generate samples of @xmath34 from the gaussian distribution with central values and errors from the lattice data .",
    "the samples of @xmath43 coupling @xmath42 and @xmath56 are also generated from the some distributions based on the best knowledge of @xmath42 and @xmath47 , from which the samples of @xmath57 are produced .",
    "they can be used as additional data of the form factor for the dispersive bounds .",
    "2 .   from each sample of @xmath58 , the dispersive bounds @xmath59 ( and @xmath60 ) are derived and each sample is accepted or rejected under the condition a , so that a conditional distribution is produced .",
    "3 .   for each accepted sample , we compute the upper and lower bounds of the partial decay rate @xmath61 s for a given set of @xmath1 bins .",
    "we create samples of @xmath0 and @xmath62 s .",
    "we assume @xmath0 distributes uniformly within a conservatively wide range , i.e. @xmath63 $ ] . and",
    "@xmath62 s are distributed by a gaussian around their central values with variances given by the cleo data .",
    "we further impose the following physical condition for the set of samples @xmath64 .",
    "+   condition b : :    ( physical condition ) :    +    * the experimental data @xmath62 s should lie    within the upper and lower bounds from the theory simultaneously for    all @xmath65 , i.e. +    @xmath66 ( i=@xmath67 ) . + try this test for all samples , select only those combinations which satisfies the condition b and reject others .",
    "this makes another conditional distribution of the set of samples @xmath68 which satisfies both condition a and b.    mathematically the original probability for the set of samples @xmath69 is given by the following product @xmath70 where n is the normalization constant .",
    "the probability @xmath71 are gaussian distributions based on theoretical or experimental data , where as @xmath72 are uniform distributions .    after imposing the condition",
    "a , the probability becomes @xmath73 where @xmath74 is another normalization constant to make the total probability unity . by further imposing the condition",
    "b , the probability then becomes @xmath75 where @xmath76 is another normalization constant .",
    "using this last conditional distribution @xmath77 , the distributions of any quantities defined from the set of samples @xmath78 , can be derived , which of course includes that of @xmath0 .",
