    "a pressure gradient can only exist along the axial direction and , therefore , the pressure is constant in the pipe cross - section .",

    "this implies that @xmath125 , which necessarily requires a constant fluid temperature along the entire pipe . for this particular example , the pressure drop  calculated by integrating the momentum equation  equates exactly to the total dissipation , however , this equality seems unlikely for turbulent or transitional flows . for parabolic laminar flow , the advection term in the momentum equation vanishes , which is not the case for turbulent pipe flows . for us ,",
    "the determination of the friction factor from the integration of the stresses at the pipe boundary , is incomplete because we are missing all the dissipative processes in the core of the flow .",
    "thus , we believe that a pressure drop expressed in terms of the total dissipation , instead of the wall shear stress , is the most appropriate way to obtain a friction factor .",
    "to investigate the connection between the pressure drop and viscous dissipation in a turbulent flow , we integrate eq .",
    "( a15 ) and apply a time average , that is ,    _ a h * * u**d*a * = _ a ( + ) d**a * * + _ * * u**d [ eqn : enthalpy6 ]    where @xmath126 indicates a fluctuation , and @xmath127 and @xmath128 a time average .",
    "since the velocity is zero at walls , the surface integrals reduce only to the inlet and outlet . for a fully ",
    "developed turbulent flow , the magnitude of pressure and velocity fluctuations are translation - invariant along the axial direction and , thus , the integration of @xmath129 vanishes . for a turbulent fully developed pipe flow ,",
    "the time - averaged pressure @xmath130 is constant in the pipe cross section , hence    _ a h * * u**d*a * = ( _ out-_in ) va + _ * * u**d [ eqn : enthalpy7 ]    for the laminar case it was proved that the enthalpy of the fluid is constant , but no such mathematical proof can be obtained for the turbulent case .",
    "however , and since the pressure drop is the only injection of energy to the system ( adiabatic case ) , we have that .",
    "if the energy introduced into the fluid is not fully dissipated , then there can not by a statistical steady state .",
    "thus , to have a fully developed turbulent pipe flow , the pressure drop must balance the total dissipation .",
    "hence ,    p= -_**u**d .",
    "[ eqn : pressure_drop_methods ]    an obvious experimental validation of our conclusion seems to be simple , but to the best of our knowledge , there is not a single experiment dedicated to measuring directly a possible viscous heating in pipe flow .",
    "sukanek and laurance @xcite measured indirectly the viscous `` heating '' by measuring the torque needed to rotate two concentric cylinders with an intervening viscous fluid . since they used a fluid with a viscosity highly dependent on temperature , they argued that a departure from linearity between the shear stress and strain rate would indicate a temperature increase .",
    "indeed , they observed this departure from linearity , but the measured values for the shear stress were much lower than the theoretical ones .",
    "the authors attributed this discrepancy to possible air trapped in between the two cylinders .",
    "if that is the case , a small amount of trapped air can significantly change the problem .",
    "our analysis is valid strictly for an incompressible flow , and compressibility effects can arise in two - phase flows @xcite at much lower speeds than sound speed of the phases composing the two - phase mixture .",
    "when the pressure terms in eq .",
    "( a15 ) are omitted , the only logical conclusion is that the temperature must increase due to viscous heating , but this is a conclusion based on an incomplete derivation of the enthalpy equation .",
    "if our derivation of the enthalpy equation is wrong and the pressure terms must indeed be omitted , then based on an equilibrium between the injected energy and the dissipation , the enthalpy change must equal the pressure drop .",
    "thus , the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet should be given by @xmath131 .",
    "this would mean that the pressure drop is completely converted into sensible heat .",
    "our conclusion could be validated or discredited by simply measuring the pressure drop and temperature at the inlet and outlet of a very well insulated long pipe .",
    "to determine the dissipation scale @xmath64 , we can make use of our definition of the pressure drop in terms of the total dissipation eq . ( [ eqn : pressure_drop_methods ] ) . this equation can be written as    f = _ _ 0 d + _ _0 d    as discussed in the text , the component associated to @xmath132 vanishes for high reynolds numbers .",
    "thus , to have a constant friction factor as @xmath133 , the second term must be constant . defining the dissipation scale as    = _ _0",
    "d    we arrive at once to    = c _ [ eqn : dissipation_scale ]    with @xmath134 a dimensionless constant .",
    "this dissipation scale is consistent with the upper bound derived by doering and constantin @xcite in shear driven turbulence , which supports our definition for the pressure drop .",
    "using the phenomenological spectrum , the turbulent component of the fraction factor is written as"

    "<S> after decades of experimental , theoretical , and numerical research in fluid dynamics , many aspects of turbulence remain poorly understood . the main reason for this </S>",
    "<S> is often attributed to the multiscale nature of turbulent flows , which poses a formidable challenge . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , properties of these flows whose roles and inter - connections have never been clarified fully . in this article , we present a new connection between the pressure drop , viscous dissipation , and the turbulent energy spectrum , which , to the best of our knowledge , has never been established prior to our work . </S>",
    "<S> we use this finding to show analytically that viscous dissipation in laminar pipe flows can not increase the temperature of the fluid , and to also reproduce qualitatively nikuradse s experimental results involving pressure drops in turbulent flows in rough pipes .    for centuries </S>",
    "<S> , turbulence has remained stubbornly one of the most challenging problems to solve in classical physics . </S>",
    "<S> the multiscale character of turbulent flows , and the poorly understood fundamental mechanisms for distributing the kinetic energy among the large number of harmonics which constitute the fluctuating velocity field , are among the main difficulties that complicate significantly the analysis of turbulent flows . </S>",
    "<S> it is well accepted that vortex stretching is one of the main mechanisms responsible for transferring energy from low to high wave numbers . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism , however , only exists in viscous , three - dimensional turbulence , and has no analogue in quantum @xcite , as well as two - dimensional turbulence @xcite . the pictorial energy cascade proposed by richardson @xcite , and then recovered theoretically first by kolmogorov @xcite , and </S>",
    "<S> then , independently , by onsager @xcite , does not reveal much about the energy transfer between consecutive harmonics ; it only represents an ` equilibrium ' state of energy distribution arising from a balance between the fluxes of energy going up and down the cascade . </S>",
    "<S> despite the fact that viscous dissipation is irrelevant for quantum turbulence , the scaling laws dominating its energy cascade are the same as those in viscous , three - dimensional turbulence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what , then , is the true role of viscous dissipation in the formation of the energy cascade , and what is the actual physical meaning of ` dissipation ' and its connection to macroscopic quantities such as the pressure drop ?    </S>",
    "<S> we start our discussion with the enthalpy equation for a pure single phase incompressible flow , ( see appendix for a detailed derivation ) , where @xmath0 is the material derivative , @xmath1 the enthalpy per unit mass , @xmath2 the heat flux , @xmath3 the pressure , and @xmath4 the viscous stress tensor . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown ( see appendix ) that for a fully - developed laminar , and adiabatic flow in a cylindrical pipe , the integration of the enthalpy equation in the whole domain @xmath5 , leads to a pressure drop that balances exactly the total viscous dissipation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mean flow velocity , and @xmath8 the pipe cross - sectional area . </S>",
    "<S> this linear relationship between the total dissipation , given by the volumetric integral in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : pressure_drop_1 ] ) , and the external forcing , corresponding to the pressure drop , is one of the central results of the present study . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a linear relationship between dissipation and external stimuli has recently been observed in turbulent quantum gases ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2e in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : pressure_drop_1 ] ) implies that for incompressible , fully - developed pipe flow , a fluid can not increase its temperature due to viscous dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to be a somewhat counterintuitive conclusion because the energy per unit volume injected into the fluid , in the form of pressure at the pipe inlet , must be dissipated into some form of microscopic energy . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a detailed derivation of the entropy equation ( see appendix ) shows that the entropy of the fluid does change with the viscous dissipation , that is , .    </S>",
    "<S> a change in the entropy of the system indicates that viscous dissipation is indeed a form of heat , but not necessarily of the sensible type . from a statistical mechanics view point , </S>",
    "<S> the entropy , @xmath9 , defined in terms of microstates probabilities @xmath10 as @xmath11 , is a measure of the total number of accessible microstates to a system , @xmath12 , under a given pressure and temperature . by changing the internal energy of a microstate , we alter its probability and , therefore , the entropy of the system . by applying a higher pressure at the inlet of a pipe , </S>",
    "<S> we restrict molecules from sampling certain configurations , which at lower pressures , are readily available . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when the pressure drops along the pipe , the entropy increases by having a larger number of accessible molecular configurations . </S>",
    "<S> when we perform isothermal ( i.e. neglecting the energy equation ) incompressible direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows , we are implicitly satisfying eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : pressure_drop_1 ] ) . a different scenario exists for compressible flows , where fluid compression leads to an enthalpy change .    to investigate the relevance of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : pressure_drop_1 ] ) and its connection to the energy spectrum , we follow the work of gioia and chakraborty @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they investigated the relationship between the friction factor , @xmath13 ( expressed in terms of the wall shear stress @xmath14 ) , and the phenomenological turbulent energy spectrum . considering the darcy - weisbach equation , we can express the time - averaged ( denoted by angular brackets ) pressure drop as @xmath15 where @xmath16 the hydraulic pipe diameter , @xmath17 the fluid density and @xmath18 the pipe length . the negative sign is to enforce a decrease in the pressure along the pipe . by taking the time average of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : pressure_drop_1 ] ) and substituting it into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : darcy - weisbach ] ) , we can express the friction factor in terms of the viscous dissipation , instead of the wall shear stress : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the kinematic viscosity , and is defined as the total time - averaged dissipation with @xmath21 and @xmath22 . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have used the reynolds decomposition for the velocity field @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the reynolds number , @xmath24 , is defined in terms of the hydraulic pipe diameter , @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> the main difficulty faced by gioia and chakraborty @xcite , was the determination of the wall shear stress , and how to relate it to the turbulent energy spectrum and the surface roughness . </S>",
    "<S> they postulated that the wall shear stress can be expressed in terms of a momentum transfer between the bulk flow and the flow near the wall , characterized by a velocity scale @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> expressing the wall stress as @xmath26 , the problem reduces to finding the velocity scale , which might also vary with the amplitude of the surface roughness . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , to determine the velocity scale they assumed the validity of the phenomenological energy spectrum in the proximity of the wall , which is questionable . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known , however , that to derive the phenomenological spectrum , the turbulent structures must be rotationally- and translationally - invariant ; that is , the flow is isotropic and homogenous , which is not the case near the wall . </S>",
    "<S> aware of this limitation , gioia and chakraborty @xcite argue that even for anisotropic and inhomogeneous flows , the phenomenological theory still represents a good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by using directly the energy spectrum @xmath27 ( including corrections for the energetic and dissipative ranges ) , they obtain the velocity scale as @xmath28 . here , the integration is carried out for wave numbers higher than @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is not to be confused with the entropy ) , where @xmath31 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath32 the size of the surface roughness , and @xmath33 the kolmogorov length scale . </S>",
    "<S> hence , they are effectively filtering out all eddies larger than @xmath30 in the calculation of the velocity scale .    </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that for @xmath34 , the friction factor in the work of gioia and chakraborty @xcite scales as @xmath35 despite the absence of viscous dissipation correction : without this , the total dissipation diverges when using the kolmogorov spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the authors recovered the proper scaling for the friction factor , observed in nikuradse s experimental results , only by selecting an appropriate cutoff wave length ( @xmath36 ) in the integration of the energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of physical meaning of a constant friction factor , in the absence of a correction in the dissipation range , is what motivated us to investigate a different approach to explain nikuradse s findings .    in our analysis , we start by investigating the direct connection between the friction factor , defined in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : friction ] ) with the turbulent energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we now introduce the tensor correlation @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the components of the fluctuating velocity field and @xmath40 the direction in which the correlation is being calculated . since @xmath41 can be chosen independently from @xmath42 , @xmath43 is a 3-rank tensor , with eighteen independent components . </S>",
    "<S> the position and orientation - dependent energy spectrum is directly obtained by applying the fourier transform to the tensor correlation , this is , . </S>",
    "<S> since no assumption has been made in the definition of the tensor correlation , this definition of the energy spectrum is exact . using a taylor expansion to express the tensor correlation in terms of a position and orientation - independent correlation plus a corrections </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath44 . here , @xmath45 is the homogeneous tensor correlation under rotational invariance , which has six independent components . </S>",
    "<S> we assume now that the taylor expansion is convergent and that first - order corrections are the leading terms . </S>",
    "<S> the first and second terms represent the departure from homogeneity and isotropy , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the homogeneous isotropic tensor @xmath45 can be interpreted as a spherical average followed by space average of @xmath43 . with this </S>",
    "<S> , the energy spectrum can be finally written as @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to calculate each component of the viscous dissipation easily , that is , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> these expressions are exact and the subscripts @xmath49 indicate a spectrum obtained along @xmath50 . hence , the connection between the energy spectrum and the pressure drop is directly realized trough eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : darcy - weisbach]-[eqn : friction ] ) , without the need of any _ ad hoc _ wavelength cutoff in the integral . </S>",
    "<S> following taylor s @xcite identities for isotropic turbulence , we have that the fluctuating component of the dissipation rate can be approximated by .    </S>",
    "<S> we now analyze the asymptotic behavior of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : friction ] ) . for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the appropriate scaling for laminar flow @xmath54 is recovered directly . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for @xmath34 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which is a result obtained from imposing a constant friction factor for high reynolds numbers . </S>",
    "<S> since our hypothesis is that only viscous dissipation plays a role in the friction factor ( or pressure drop ) , the important question is to know whether the two scalings , observed in rough pipe flows , @xmath57 and @xmath58 as @xmath34 , can be explained solely in terms of the fluctuating component of the viscous dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> we , therefore , center our attention on the second integral in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : friction ] ) . neglecting the correction due to anisotropy and inhomogeneity in the fluctuating part of the viscous dissipation , this integral reduces to @xmath59 , with @xmath5 the pipe volume . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath60 is isotropic and homogeneous , we will also make use of the phenomenological spectrum to determine this integral . </S>",
    "<S> since we are interested in the dissipative range of the spectrum , we consider a correction @xmath61 only for this regime . </S>",
    "<S> a correction for the inertial regime like the one used by gioia and chakraborty @xcite , is only needed to obtain a finite integral length scale defined as @xmath62 . without the correction for the inertial regime , </S>",
    "<S> the integral length scale diverges . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we choose @xmath63 , with @xmath8 a dimensionless constant and @xmath64 a dissipation rate scale ( which must not be confused with @xmath65 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from this result that without the correction for the dissipative regime , the total dissipation diverges .    to recover the proper scaling for the turbulent friction factor </S>",
    "<S> , the problem reduces to choosing an appropriate correction @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we can recover the correct scaling by selecting @xmath68 \\eta q \\right)$ ] , with @xmath69 $ ] a dimensionless function , @xmath70 the kolmogorov s length scale , and @xmath71 a dimensionless constant . by choosing ( see appendix ) </S>",
    "<S> we recover the scaling @xmath72 and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the blending function @xmath74^{-1}$ ] , with @xmath75 , bridges the blasius and strickler regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the constants @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 were determined from a fit to nikuradse s data . </S>",
    "<S> goldenfeld@xcite postulated that the turbulent friction factor can be expressed in general as @xmath79 for the blasius and strickler regimes , with @xmath80 an unknown function of the reynolds number and the relative surface roughness @xmath81 . by plotting nikuradse s data as @xmath82 vs @xmath83 </S>",
    "<S> , goldenfeld was able to collapse almost perfectly the experimental points onto a single curve . by utilizing a second function @xmath84 \\right)$ ] to bridge the laminar and turbulent regimes , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( </S>",
    "<S> also determined from a fit ) , we can reproduce goldenfeld s findings over the entire range of @xmath87 including the laminar regime . thus , by expressing the friction factor as @xmath88 , we can closely match nikurade s results , as demonstrated in fig . 1 .     [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : image ]    elaborate procedures to fit nikuradse s data have already been presented @xcite ; obtaining an optimal fit to these experimental data is not our purpose . </S>",
    "<S> we have used nikuradse s data only to show that when the kolmogorov scale in the correcting factor for the dissipative range is re - scaled properly to account for surface roughness effects , the appropriate scaling for the friction factor is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> we also note the work of mejia - alvarez and christensen @xcite , who studied experimentally the effects of surface roughness on the velocity fluctuations near a wall , showed that the intensity of the velocity fluctuations is significantly higher for rough surfaces relative to smooth ones . </S>",
    "<S> their results support our findings in two ways : first , larger fluctuations indicate higher dissipation in agreement with a higher pressure drop . </S>",
    "<S> second , turbulent structures developed at or near the rough wall , penetrate into the main flow up to a certain depth . therefore , in this wall - affected region , the dissipation scale ( and therefore the kolmogorov scale ) must be modified to account for the stronger energy sinks .    in conclusion , we have uncovered a new connection between the pressure drop and the turbulent energy spectrum for incompressible flows , which necessarily implies that the energy of the fluid ( per unit volume ) stored in the form of pressure , is not dissipated in the form of sensible heat . </S>",
    "<S> for fully - developed turbulent flows , the turbulent kinetic energy is translationally - invariant and , therefore , does not decay along the pipe . </S>",
    "<S> this is only possible because the pressure , not the kinetic energy , is the quantity that is being dissipated into heat . </S>",
    "<S> we tested the new relationship between pressure drop and the turbulence energy spectrum , by introducing a variable correction to the phenomenological spectrum in the dissipative regime . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the kolmogorov scale must be modified in the presence of surface roughness , to properly account for the penetration of turbulent structures , developed near rough walls , into the main stream , and the consequent higher viscous dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> these new findings are currently being used to unveil a new relationship between the eddy viscosity with the reynolds number , which is expected to shed new light on the ` closure ' problem . </S>",
