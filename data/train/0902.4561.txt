    "in this paper , we give further consideration to the 1-d continuum model for adhesion / diffusion of biological cells developed by anguige and schmeiser in @xcite , which took the form of the nonlinear diffusion equation = ( d ( ) ) , [ cont_rho]with quadratic diffusivity d()= 3(-)^2 + 1- , [ d]for the scaled cell density @xmath0 $ ] , and the adhesion coefficient @xmath1 $ ] , the boundary condition being just @xmath2 at @xmath3 .",
    "these equations were obtained as the formal continuum limit of the fundamental biased - random - walk model    = ^+_i-1_i-1+^-_i+1_i+1-(^+_i+^-_i)_i  , [ walk ] with transitional probabilities ^_i = ( 1-_i1)(1-_i1)/h^2 , [ ti ] on a lattice of points @xmath4 , by taking taylor expansions about @xmath5 , and letting @xmath6 . in the derivation of this equation , @xmath7 was interpreted as a ( microscopic ) measure of cell size .",
    "we recall from @xcite that ( [ cont_rho])-([d ] ) is globally well posed if @xmath8 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath9 then ( [ cont_rho])-([d ] ) is ill - posed iff the initial density profile protrudes into the ` unstable ' interval i_= ( ^ ( ) , ^()):= ( , ) , [ rhointerval ] since in that case @xmath10 is positive iff @xmath11 , and positivity is preserved by the maximum principle .",
    "for completeness , note that in the borderline case @xmath12 , equation ( [ cont_rho ] ) is just the porous - medium equation with quadratic diffusivity and possible change of sign about @xmath13 . for initial data which stays away from @xmath13 (",
    "either above or below ) , ( [ cont_rho ] ) is uniformly parabolic , and global existence of a smooth solution follows as for @xmath8 , while for degenerate initial data one is merely guaranteed a ( unique ) globally existing weak solution @xcite .",
    "the ill - posedness of ( [ cont_rho ] ) for @xmath9 is related to the presence of fine ( wavelength @xmath14 ) spatial oscillations , as well as plateau formation , in solutions of the discrete system ( [ walk ] ) , and the absence of a straightforward existence theory for ( [ cont_rho ] ) leads one to ask just what model should be taken as a reasonable continuum limit of ( [ walk ] ) in the high - adhesion regime .",
    "one approach , and the one we shall adopt in this paper , is to circumvent the problem of ill - posedness by simply declaring that @xmath15-values in @xmath16 are forbidden , and considering solutions to ( [ cont_rho])-([d ] ) which may jump across @xmath16 ( possibly multiple times ) , but which are otherwise smooth .",
    "mathematically , one is then dealing with a kind of ( multi - phase ) stefan problem for the density @xmath17 and the jump locations @xmath18 , such that the @xmath19 are dynamically determined by local conservation of mass , or , in other words , by the rankine - hugoniot condition .    in @xcite ,",
    "the analysis of ( [ walk ] ) was aided by considering higher - order modifications of the leading - order equation ( [ cont_rho ] ) .",
    "one such @xmath20-modification takes the form of the fourth - order pde [ mod - equ ] = ( k ( ) + h^2((-1 ) - ( ) ^2 + ) ) , where the cubic @xmath21 is a primitive for @xmath10 .",
    "this equation is rather similar to the viscous cahn - hilliard equation @xcite , and is a regularisation of ( [ cont_rho ] ) in the sense that it is ( at least locally ) well - posed on @xmath22 , for each fixed value of the microscopic parameter @xmath7 , and for all @xmath23 .",
    "presumably , solutions continue to exist globally , as for cahn - hilliard , but a proof is currently lacking .",
    "the steady - state equation for ( [ mod - equ ] ) can , after a change of variables , be written as a hamiltonian dynamical system , and amongst the solutions there is , for each @xmath24 , a unique heteroclinic cycle .",
    "these heteroclinic cycles correspond to ( two - level ) plateau solutions of ( [ mod - equ ] ) , are close ( for small @xmath7 ) to square - wave weak solutions of ( [ cont_rho ] ) , and their critical points , denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , match very well the numerically - observed long - time plateau values in solutions of ( [ walk ] ) ( see @xcite ) . for these reasons , we demand in our stefan - problem framework that any jumps across @xmath29 should connect @xmath25 to @xmath26 . furthermore , in order to avoid the degeneracies at @xmath30 , we require that the initial data satisfy @xmath31 in low - density phases , and @xmath32 in high - density ones .",
    "we emphasise that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are determined by the particular choice of microscopic model ( [ walk])-([ti ] ) ; other model choices are possible , and these will result in different @xmath15-values .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we develop a partial existence theory and perform a steady - state analysis for the simplest stefan problem , namely , that for which there is only a single discontinuity in the density ; solution behaviour is further clarified with the aid of several numerical simulations . in section 3 , we extend the analysis to the general multi - phase case , which , in particular , allows for the annihilation of phases via coalescence events . finally , in the appendices , we collect a number of results from classical parabolic theory which are used throughout the paper .",
    "we begin the analysis by considering the simplest possible case , in which there are just two phases , connected by a single jump from @xmath33 to @xmath34 ; this situation is depicted in figure 1 . for definiteness , we will assume that the low - density phase lies to the left , and the high - density phase to the right , of the discontinuity ; the converse arrangement can , of course , also be treated .",
    "let the location of the jump discontinuity be denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "the stefan problem for a given @xmath9 then consists of looking for a function @xmath17 on @xmath36\\times[0,t]$ ] which satisfies = ( d ( ) ) ; 0<x < s(t),[lphase]g subject to ( 0,t ) = 0,(s^-(t),t ) = _ 1 ( ) , and = ( d ( ) ) ; s(t)<x<1 , subject to ( 1,t ) = 0,(s^+(t),t ) = _ 2().[rphase ]    the evolution of @xmath35 is determined by the rankine - hugoniot jump condition    = , [ rh ] where the fluxes are given by @xmath37 , this equation being obtained by differentiating the statement of conservation of mass    _",
    "0^s(t ) ( x , t )  dx + _ s(t)^1 ( x , t )  dx = m,[mass ] and using ( [ lphase])-([rphase ] ) .",
    "the initial datum for @xmath15 , satisfying the boundary and jump conditions , is chosen to be smooth away from the initial discontinuity , with @xmath31 in the low - density phase and @xmath32 in the high - density phase . by construction , @xmath10 is then initially positive on each phase , and , by virtue of the maximum principle , we can reasonably expect the stefan problem to be well posed . in the sequel",
    ", we will refer to the coupled system ( [ lphase])-([rh ] ) as @xmath38 ; analogous problems @xmath39 , with @xmath40 jumps , will be treated in section 3 .",
    "finally , note that we allow for the possibility that @xmath35 may hit the domain boundary at @xmath41 or @xmath42 in finite time . in this case , provided the gradient remains bounded as the boundary is approached , the solution can be continued via the ordinary neumann problem for ( [ cont_rho ] ) , which we will call @xmath43 . as a convention ,",
    "a solution continued in this way will still be referred to globally as a solution of @xmath38 .",
    "if the total mass @xmath44 satisfies @xmath45 then there is precisely one discontinuous steady - state solution of @xmath38 , given by the step function ^(x ) & = & \\ {    ccc _ 1 & : & x    .",
    "+ s^ & = & , [ s_star ] while if @xmath46 or @xmath47 then no such discontinuous solution exists .",
    "moreover , @xmath38 clearly has the uniform steady - state solution ( x)=m ,  0x1 if and only if @xmath48 or @xmath49 .    for the two possible kinds of steady state we have the following stability results",
    ":    suppose we have a global smooth solution pair , ( @xmath50 ) , for @xmath38 , with initial data @xmath51 , such that @xmath52 . then +   + ( i ) if @xmath53 , @xmath17 converges exponentially to @xmath54 in @xmath55-norm , and @xmath35 converges exponentially to @xmath56 , as @xmath57 , +   + ( ii ) if @xmath58 ( resp .",
    "@xmath59 ) , and @xmath60 in the low ( high ) phase , the solution is attracted towards @xmath61 as in ( i ) , +   + ( iii ) if @xmath62 ( resp .",
    "@xmath63 ) , then @xmath35 hits @xmath64 in finite time , and the continued solution converges to the uniform steady state @xmath65 , exponentially in @xmath55 .",
    "+   + ( iv ) if @xmath66 ( resp .",
    "@xmath67 ) , then @xmath68 @xmath69 as @xmath70 , some @xmath71 , with the possibility that @xmath72 , and @xmath17 approaches @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) exponentially in @xmath55 in the low ( high ) phase as @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath71 is finite , the continued solution of np converges to the uniform steady state @xmath65 , exponentially in @xmath55 .",
    "_  to prove ( i ) , first note that , by ( [ mass ] ) and the fact that @xmath15 can not enter @xmath73 , 0<s_mins(t)s_max<1  , t , where s_min(m ) & = & ( ^-m)/^ , + s_max(m ) & = & ( 1-m)/(1-^ ) .    next note that , on the subinterval @xmath74 , we have    ( -_1 ) = ( d()(-_1 ) ) .",
    "hence , multiplying through by @xmath75 , integrating by parts , and using the mixed boundary conditions gives    _ 0^s(t)(-_1)^2  dx = -_0^s(t)d()(_x(-_1))^2  dx , which implies -_1 ^ 2_l^2(0,s ) -_x(-_1)^2_l^2(0,s),[l2 ] where @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath77 at @xmath78 , we also have the poincar inequality    -_1_l^2(0,s)s_x(-_1)_l^2(0,s ) , and hence ( [ l2 ] ) implies    -_1 ^ 2_l^2(0,s)(t)-_1 ^ 2_l^2(0,s)(0)e^-t / s^2_max .",
    "an analogous inequality on the subinterval @xmath79 is obtained in exactly the same way .",
    "next , from ( [ mass ] ) we have    _ 0^s(t ) ( ( x , t)-_1 )  dx  +  _ 1s(t )  +  _ s(t)^1 ( ( x , t)-_2 )  dx  +  _ 2(1-s(t ) ) = m , and hence , rearranging and using the @xmath55-decay just shown ,        substituting the definition of @xmath56 from ( [ s_star ] ) into ( [ s_est1 ] ) gives us        to prove ( ii ) , note , for example , that if @xmath58 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 then @xmath65 is a supersolution in the low phase . from this",
    ", it follows once again that @xmath35 remains bounded away from @xmath82 and @xmath42 , by conservation of mass .",
    "convergence to @xmath61 is proved as before .",
    "the same argument goes through for @xmath59 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 .    for ( iii ) , if @xmath62  ( resp .",
    "@xmath63 ) then the only candidate for a steady - state solution is given by @xmath65 and @xmath85 , and , by @xmath55-decay in the low ( high ) phase and conservation of mass , @xmath35 is forced to hit the boundary in finite time ; @xmath55-convergence for the subsequent @xmath43 is proved via the usual energy estimate    finally , if @xmath66 ( resp .",
    "@xmath34 ) , then the only possible steady state is @xmath77 @xmath86 for @xmath87 . clearly , @xmath35 remains bounded away from @xmath82 ( @xmath42 ) and therefore @xmath88 decays to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , exponentially in @xmath55 on @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , as we have already seen .",
    "the @xmath55-decay implies that @xmath68 ( @xmath82 ) as @xmath91 increases , but the convergence may take infinitely long in this exceptional case ; if the convergence takes place in finite time then the subsequent @xmath43 is as in ( iii ) .",
    "this proves part ( iv ) @xmath92 +   + we conclude this discussion by noting that , for the cases not covered by theorem 2.1 , namely    1 .   @xmath93  for some @xmath94 , 2 .",
    "@xmath95  for some @xmath96 ,    we have not been able to find a clean analytical criterion for determining which of the two possible steady states will be approached at large times , for given initial data .",
    "however , in the next subsection we show that the discontinuous steady state ( [ s_star ] ) is always linearly stable in a certain sense , whenever it exists , and , moreover , we report on numerical simulations which suggest that @xmath35 can hit the domain boundary in finite time , provided condition 1 or 2 ( directly above ) is satisifed , and the initial density profile is sufficiently far from ( [ s_star ] ) ; in other words , @xmath38 appears to be bistable for some values of the total mass .",
    "we can make a connection between our moving - boundary problem @xmath38 and the traditional two - phase stefan problem for the melting of ice in water by identifying @xmath15 as the specific latent heat , and @xmath97 as the temperature . in the traditional formulation ,",
    "our low - density phase is thought of as the solid , and our high - density phase as the liquid phase . given this ,",
    "one imposes the physically reasonable condition _ 0_1  _ 0_2  , [ class_data ] and then one can write down a favourable weak formulation of the problem , which can be shown to have a unique solution for bounded data ( see appendix c ) . furthermore",
    ", this weak solution turns out to be a global - in - time smooth solution of the original problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    for @xmath38",
    ", however , the restriction on the initial data is just _",
    "0<^  _ 0>^  , [ sp_1_data ] which is weaker than ( [ class_data ] ) . in particular",
    ", this entails that @xmath21 can no longer be assumed monotonically increasing , and , consequently , that there is no nice weak formulation of the problem .",
    "we note that , in the literature , uniqueness of solutions , given ( [ class_data ] ) , is usually proved using the weak formulation @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the basic proof of local existence of smooth solutions as presented in @xcite , for example , it is not so easy to discern whether the restriction ( [ class_data ] ) can be relaxed to ( [ sp_1_data ] ) . for these reasons ,",
    "we now present a concise , reasonably self - contained , classical existence - and - uniqueness theory for @xmath38 , with data subject merely to ( [ sp_1_data ] ) , which employs the standard hlder and sobolev estimates of linear parabolic theory .      in order to solve the moving - boundary problem @xmath38 ,",
    "we employ , in each phase , the standard trick of rescaling the spatial variable ( see , for example , @xcite ) , such that ( [ lphase ] ) and ( [ rphase ] ) become a pair of fixed - boundary problems , coupled by the ( rescaled ) rankine - hugoniot condition .",
    "specifically , for @xmath98 we introduce the coordinate transformation    ( x , t ) ( , ) : = , = t , while for @xmath99 we take    ( x , t ) ( , ) : = , = t .    in terms of these new coordinates , and writing @xmath100 for @xmath98 , @xmath101 for @xmath99 , equations ( [ lphase ] ) and ( [ rphase ] ) become , upon dropping hats ,    = ( d(v ) ) + x,[v ] for @xmath102 , subject to @xmath103 , and , respectively ,    = ( d(w ) ) + , [ w ] for @xmath102 , subject to @xmath104 , while the jump condition ( [ rh ] ) assumes the form    = - ( - ) ( _ 2-_1)^-1,[rescaled_rh ] and we also have the rescaled conservation - of - mass equation    s(t ) = .[resc_com ]    finally , for the application of classical parabolic theory , the initial data and the dirichlet condition at @xmath105 must satisfy a certain first - order compatibility condition , which is obtained by setting @xmath106 and @xmath107 equal to zero in ( [ v ] ) and ( [ w ] ) , and substituting the initial data , evaluated at the phase boundary , into the right - hand sides of ( [ v ] ) , ( [ w ] ) , and ( [ rescaled_rh ] ) .",
    "the most compact way of writing this compatibility condition is to go back to the original coordinates and introduce the dependent ( temperature ) variable @xmath108 , in terms of which the relevant equations are simply -_x^+(_x^+ - _ x^- ) & = & d(_1)_xx^+ , + -_x^-(_x^+ - _ x^- ) & = & d(_2)_xx^- , where , for example , @xmath109 .",
    "we are able to prove the following :    given initial data @xmath110 , such that @xmath111 ,  @xmath112 ,  @xmath52 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and such that the first - order compatibility condition is satisfied , the system of equations ( [ v ] ) , ( [ w ] ) , ( [ rescaled_rh ] ) ( and hence problem @xmath38 ) has a unique classical solution on some small time interval @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "_  the proof proceeds via an iterative scheme of successive approximations , and to get the required strong - convergence properties , we work in the setting of ` parabolic ' hlder spaces .",
    "first of all , we set @xmath116\\times[0,t]$ ] , and , as in @xcite , @xcite , for example , let @xmath117 , @xmath112 non - integer , denote the banach space of functions @xmath118 with continuous derivatives @xmath119 , for @xmath120 , equipped with the norm     d^r_td^s_xu^(l-[l])_x , q_t + _ 0<l-2r - s<2d_t^rd_x^su^(l-2r - s)/2_t , q_t , where , for @xmath121 ,    v^()_x , q_t & = & _ ( x , t),(x,t)q_t\\{|v(x , t)-v(x,t)||x - x|^- } , + v^()_t , q_t & = & _ ( x , t),(x , t)q_t\\{|v(x , t)-v(x , t)||t - t|^-}.    now we describe our iterative scheme for obtaining new approximate solutions of ( [ v ] ) , ( [ w ] ) , ( [ rescaled_rh ] ) from old ones .",

    "next , determine the approximant @xmath126 by solving the nonlinear ode    = - ( - ) ( _ 2-_1)^-1,[iterated_rh ] which , for the given datum @xmath127 , has a unique smooth solution on @xmath115 $ ] , provided @xmath128 is chosen small enough ( picard s theorem ) .",

    "these equations are parabolic , by the choice of @xmath123 , and therefore have unique smooth solutions @xmath134 on @xmath124 , by lemma a.1 ( see appendix a ) , which is a convenient summary of relevant results from classical parabolic theory @xcite ; the updated approximants also have corresponding positive diffusivities , by the maximum principle .",

    "specifically , we use a method - of - lines approach in which the diffusion terms in ( [ v ] ) and ( [ w ] ) are discretised using the random - walk model ( [ walk ] ) , while the advection terms are discretised by means of a standard , explicit upwinding scheme . a simulation",
    "in which the global - existence criterion ( [ class_data ] ) is satisfied is shown in figure 2 , and one in which it is violated is shown in figure 3 . in each case",

    "several other simulations have been carried out in the case where ( [ class_data ] ) is violated , and no singularities have been observed to develop .    turning to the question of bistability for cetain values of the mass @xmath44 , we next show in figure 4 a close - up of a solution with @xmath231 and @xmath232 , for which the phase boundary hits the domain boundary in finite time .",
    "this should be compared with the simulation shown in figure 5 , in which the solution has the same mass and adhesion coefficient , but this time evolves to the unique discontinuous steady state as @xmath57 .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that such bistability can not occur if the traditional restriction ( [ class_data ] ) is imposed on the initial data , by theorem 2.1 .",
    "we now consider the general case of our stefan - problem set - up , in which the initial density profile jumps @xmath40 times across the the unstable region @xmath16 .",
    "this initial / boundary - value problem will be denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "the problem @xmath39 consists of looking for a piecewise - smooth @xmath15 which satisfies the diffusion equation ( [ cont_rho ] ) away from @xmath40 discontinuities @xmath18 , with @xmath233 , such that @xmath15 always jumps between @xmath33 and @xmath34 at the @xmath19 , which evolve according to the rankine - hugoniot condition = , [ rh_i ] where @xmath234 , and @xmath235=(\\rho(s_i^+,t)-\\rho(s_i^-,t))$ ]  ( @xmath236 ) , and the neumann condition is again imposed at the domain boundary @xmath237 ; a schematic for @xmath39 is given in figure 6 .",
    "we also allow for the possibility that @xmath238 or @xmath239 may hit the domain boundary in finite time , or that neighbouring discontinuities could collide , leading to the annihilation of a phase .",
    "should any of these events occur , the solution can be continued via @xmath240 or @xmath241 , as appropriate , and so on . a solution continued in this way",
    "will still be referred to globally as a solution of @xmath39 .",
    "the steady - state picture for @xmath39 , given @xmath242 is more complicated than that for @xmath38 .",
    "first of all , for a given mass @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45 , there is a continuum of two - valued , @xmath40-jump steady states , each of which is given by a choice of the @xmath19 which merely has to be compatible with @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , discontinuous steady states with fewer than @xmath40 jumps can also be considered permissible - these could be approached dynamically by ( multiple ) coalescence events , and/or by ( successive ) collisions of phase boundaries with the domain boundary . each steady state with more than one discontinuity is expected to be merely neutrally stable , since the total mass is invariant under small translations of an internal phase ( i.e. , one which does _ not _ touch the domain boundary ) .",
    "if the stronger condition @xmath53 holds , then there is no possible continuous steady state , and thus , for a global solution of @xmath39 , at least one discontinuity must remain as @xmath57 . if , instead , @xmath58 or @xmath59 , then the uniform steady state exists alongside the discontinuous family already discussed . in this regard , note that figures 4 and 5 could be considered as simulations of one half of a reflection - symmetric @xmath243 , with @xmath244 , in which the central high - density phase is either annihilated in finite time ( figure 4 ) or preserved as @xmath57 ( figure 5 ) , depending on the proximity of the initial data to the ( unique ) discontinuous , symmetric steady state .    in general",
    ", it is difficult to say anything analytical about the stability of steady states of @xmath39 , although in each phase the solution will still decay to @xmath33 or @xmath34 , as appropriate , exponentially in @xmath55 , by essentially the same calculation as in section 2.2 , as long as the relevant phase boundaries stay away from the domain boundary .",
    "finally , note that if @xmath47 or @xmath46 , then there is only one possible steady state , namely the uniform one , and , by @xmath55-decay , phase boundaries for a global solution must disappear in finite time ( or possibly infinite time in the exceptional cases @xmath245 ) via coalescence events , or by merging with the domain boundary .",
    "for the subsequent @xmath43 , exponential @xmath55-convergence to the uniform steady state @xmath65 follows as before .",
    "the multi - phase problem , @xmath39 , is solved , locally in time , in the same way as @xmath38 ; in each phase the spatial variable is rescaled in order to fix the moving boundary ( or boundaries ) , and the same estimates go through as before .    to be explicit ,",
    "on the interval @xmath246 $ ] we make the coordinate transformation ( x , t ) ( , ) : = , = t , such that , writing @xmath247 , the governing pde ( [ cont_rho ] ) becomes , upon dropping hats = ( s_i+1-s_i)^-2(d(v_i ) ) + , [ v_i ] on @xmath36\\times[0,t]$ ] , for @xmath248 , where we adopt the conventions @xmath249 and @xmath250 .    on an internal phase ,",
    "this equation is to be solved subject to the appropriate dirichlet conditions at @xmath237 , while on an extremal phase the mixed neumann / dirichlet conditions are used , as in the two - phase case ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the rescaled family of rankine - hugoniot conditions takes the form = -(-)(_2-_1)^-1,[rescaled_rh_i ] for @xmath251 .",
    "equations ( [ v_i ] ) , ( [ rescaled_rh_i ] ) are solved by the same kind of iteration employed for @xmath38 ; the required hlder estimates are obtained via linear parabolic theory and picard s theorem for systems of odes .",
    "the upshot of all this is    given initial data @xmath252 , @xmath251 , for which the @xmath253 and @xmath254 belong to the hlder space @xmath255 , @xmath112 , and such that the first - order compatibility conditions are satisfied , the system of equations ( [ v_i ] ) , ( [ rescaled_rh_i ] ) , and hence problem @xmath39 , has a unique classical solution on some small time interval @xmath115 $ ] .      with the same notation as in sect .",
    "2.4 , and by a similar calculation , it is straightforward to see that the gradient of a local solution of @xmath39 satisfies , for @xmath175 , the _ a priori _ estimate ( _ x)^m^2_l^2((0,1))()_i[]_i(_x(s_i^+)-_x(s_i^-))(_x^2m(s_i^+)-_x^2m(s_i^- ) ) .",
    "thus , @xmath201 , and hence also the @xmath256 and @xmath257 , are bounded for all time , provided [ ] _ i(_x(s_i^+)+_x(s_i^-))0,i .",
    "this condition holds if , for example ,    _ 0_1,_0_2,[grad_cond2 ] which is the multi - phase analogue of ( [ class_data ] ) .    inequalities ( [ grad_cond2 ] ) therefore guarantee global existence of the corresponding solution to @xmath39 , modulo coalescence events , and the possibility that an extremal discontinuity might hit the boundary in finite time .      in order to continue a solution of @xmath39 after the coalescence of two phases ,",
    "it is necessary to extend our existence theory ( which has thus far required the initial data to lie in @xmath255 ) to the case where the initial density profile may have a ` corner ' in one of the phases .",
    "this can be seen by considering the situation illustrated in figure 7 , in which two high - density phases coalesce , thus annihilating a low - density phase .",
    "if we make the assumption that condition ( [ grad_cond2 ] ) holds , then , in fact , the required extension for such phase - wise @xmath215 data follows from theorem 14 , sect.v of @xcite , and hence , putting together the results of this section , we therefore arrive at    given @xmath40 initial jump locations @xmath258 , and a phase - wise smooth initial density profile @xmath259 satisfying the first - order compatibility conditions at phase boundaries , along with the gradient condition ( [ grad_cond2 ] ) , the multi - phase stefan problem @xmath39 has a unique , global classical solution , on the understanding that phases may in time be annihilated via coalescence events , or that an extremal discontinuity may hit the domain boundary in finite time .",
    "moreover , @xmath201 is monotonically decreasing for all time .",
    "we end by noting that it is not clear whether even a local existence theorem for @xmath39 can be proved for merely @xmath215-data if ( [ grad_cond2 ] ) is not satisfied ; one can , for example , proceed by approximating @xmath215 data with smooth data , but it seems that the _ a priori _ bound on @xmath180 implied by ( [ grad_cond2 ] ) is required to get the necessary convergence .",
    "the results of this paper can be interpreted as saying that cell - cell adhesion is enough to stabilise sharp - edged aggregations of diffusing cells if there is enough mass present in the biological domain , and that diffusion homogenises the cell density in each given high- or low - density phase . for low masses ,",
    "however , narrow high - density regions can become annihilated even if the adhesion is very strong - that is to say , diffusion in the low - density regions wins , leading to a globally uniform cell density at large times . in the case of intermediate masses , bistability becomes possible - either adhesion or diffusion can win out , depending on the profile of the initial data .",
    "next , while being motivated by the adhesion - diffusion equations ( [ cont_rho ] ) and ( [ mod - equ ] ) , it should be clear that the analysis carried out in this paper does not require that the diffusivity @xmath10 have the special form ( [ d ] ) ; indeed , all arguments go through for _ any _ equation of the form @xmath260 , provided the @xmath196 function @xmath261 is increasing outside an unstable interval of @xmath15 values , and provided @xmath262_i=0 $ ] at jump locations @xmath19 .",
    "finally , one rather obvious biologically - relevant extension of the work described here would be to carry out a similar analysis with a chemotactic term factored into the right - hand side of ( [ cont_rho ] ) .",
    "in that situation , one could imagine beginning with a low - density initial datum , evolving the solution until , through chemotactic aggregation ,  @xmath15 hits the unstable region @xmath16 at some point @xmath263 , and then continuing the solution via a stefan problem with an initial spike at @xmath263 which jumps from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "the transition from well - posed neumann problem to stefan problem is somewhat singular in that case , and is the subject of ongoing analytical investigation .",
    "the author wishes to thank christian schmeiser for suggesting this problem , and for several helpful discussions along the way .",
