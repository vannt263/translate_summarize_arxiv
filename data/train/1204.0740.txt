    "light - by - light ( lbl ) scattering is a prediction of the quantum theory @xcite which thus - far has not been directly observed , mainly due to smallness of the cross section . on the other hand , the process of @xmath4 fusion ( by quasi - real photons @xmath1 or virtual photons @xmath2 ) into leptons and hadrons",
    "has been observed at nearly all high - energy colliders , see e.g.  @xcite for reviews .",
    "the two phenomena  lbl scattering and @xmath5 fusion  must be related by causality , similar to how the refraction index of light is related to its absorption in the kramers - kronig relation .",
    "the main goal of this work is to establish such relations and use them to investigate the structure of hadrons in the realm of quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction provides a clean probe and the two - photon state allows to produce hadrons with nearly all quantum numbers ( with @xmath6 ) , in contrast to the well studied single - photon scattering or production processes , which only accesses the vector states .",
    "when producing exclusive final states such as in the @xmath7 process , one accesses meson transition form factors ( ffs ) , which are some of the simplest observables where the approach to the asymptotic limit of qcd is studied along with the quark content of mesons described by distribution amplitudes ( das ) .",
    "the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd is also playing a profound role in these ffs at low momentum transfers .",
    "for example , the transition ffs of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons depend on the interplay of various symmetry breaking mechanisms in qcd , i.e. : @xmath10 symmetry breaking  @xcite , dynamical and explicit chiral symmetry breaking . in addition , the @xmath7 transition ffs are important for providing and improving constraints on the light - by - light hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath11 .",
    "the hadronic contributions to @xmath11 are at present the major uncertainty in the search for new , beyond standard model , physics in this high - precision quantity  @xcite .    in recent years , new experiments at high luminosity @xmath12 colliders such as babar and belle",
    "have vastly expanded the field of @xmath3 physics .",
    "the result of a measurement of the @xmath13 ff at large momentum transfers by the babar collaboration  @xcite came as a surprise , as this form factor seems to rise much faster than the perturbative qcd predictions for momentum transfers up to 40 gev@xmath14 .",
    "a @xmath3 physics program is planned now by the bes - iii collaboration  @xcite , which will allow to provide high - statistics results at intermediate momentum transfers for a multitude of @xmath15 observables .    in this work",
    "we use the dispersion theory to relate the two phenomena of lbl scattering and @xmath0 fusion , and express the low - energy lbl scattering as integrals over the @xmath0-fusion cross sections , where one photon is real while the second may have arbitrary ( space - like ) virtuality .",
    "these integrals , or ` sum rules ' , lead to interesting constraints on @xmath3 decay widths or @xmath0 transition ffs of @xmath16 states , and more general meson states .",

    "while the gdh - type sum rule provides a stringent constraint on the polarized @xmath3 fusion , the sum rules for the lecs allow one in principle to fully determine the low - energy lbl interaction through measuring the linearly polarized @xmath3 fusion .    in this work",
