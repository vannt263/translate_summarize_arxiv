    "it is not our aim to discuss in this paper the existence and uniqueness of minimal models , nor the methods how to construct such models explicitly .",
    "let us say only that for a large class of operads and these minimal models can be constructed using the koszul duality  @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that instead of a minimal model of @xmath2 we may use in the following constructions any cofibrant ( in a suitable sense ) resolution of @xmath2 .",
    "but since explicit minimal models of @xmath2 exist in all cases of interest we will stick to minimal models in this note .",
    "this will simplify some technicalities .",
    "assume we are given a homomorphism @xmath5 describing a @xmath2-algebra @xmath13 .",
    "to define its cohomology , we need to choose first a minimal model @xmath14 of @xmath2 .",
    "the composition @xmath15 makes @xmath6 an @xmath16-module ( in the sense of  @xcite ) , one may therefore consider the graded vector space of derivations @xmath17 . for @xmath18 define @xmath19 .",
    "it follows from the obvious fact that @xmath20 , implied by the triviality of the differential in @xmath2 , that @xmath21 is again a derivation , so @xmath22 is a well - defined endomorphism of @xmath17 which clearly satisfies @xmath23 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath17 is a non - positively graded vector space equipped with a differential of degree  @xmath11 .",
    "finally , let @xmath24 be the suspension of the graded vector space @xmath17 with reversed degrees .",
    "the differential @xmath22 induces on @xmath25 a degree @xmath26 differential denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "the _ cohomology of @xmath13 with coefficients in itself _",
    "is then defined by @xmath28 see  @xcite .    for `` classical '' algebras",
    ", the cochain complex @xmath29 agrees with the `` standard '' constructions .",
    "thus , for associative algebras ,  ( [ tel - aviv ] ) gives the hochschild cohomology , for associative commutative algebras the harrison cohomology , for lie algebras the chevalley - eilenberg cohomology ,  & c. more generally , for algebras over a quadratic koszul operad the above cohomology coincides with the triple cohomology .",
    "therefore nothing dramatically new happens here .",
    "this situation changes if we consider ( bi)algebras over a general  @xmath2 . to our best knowledge ,",

    "the result announced in the abstract follows from the following :    [ main ] let @xmath13 be a ( bi)algebra over a  @xmath2 .",
    "then there exist a graded lie algebra bracket on the cohomology @xmath36 induced by a natural @xmath0-structure @xmath37 on the defining complex @xmath29 .",
    "we will see in section  [ 1bis ] and also in section  [ 3 ] that the @xmath0-structure of theorem  [ main ] can be given by explicit formulas that involve the differential @xmath12 of the minimal model @xmath16 .",
    "it will also be clear that this @xmath0-structure uses all the information about the minimal model @xmath16 of @xmath2 and that , vice versa , the minimal model @xmath16 can be reconstructed from the knowledge of this @xmath0-structure .",
    "therefore the brackets @xmath38 can be understood as massey products that detect the homotopy type of the  @xmath2 .",
    "since the minimal model @xmath16 is , by definition , free on a @xmath39-bimodule @xmath40 , @xmath41 , it is graded by the number of generators .",
    "this means that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is spanned by `` monomials '' composed of exactly @xmath44 elements of @xmath40 .",

    "[ main1 ] if the differential of the minimal model @xmath16 of @xmath2 used in the definition of the cohomology  ( [ tel - aviv ] ) is quadratic , then the higher brackets @xmath47 of the @xmath0-structure vanish , therefore @xmath29 forms an ordinary dg lie algebra with the bracket @xmath48:= l_2(-,-)$ ] .    the minimal model of a quadratic koszul operad @xmath1",
    "is given by the cobar construction on its quadratic dual @xmath49 and is therefore quadratic .",
    "thus , for algebras over such an operad , the complex @xmath50 is a lie algebra whose bracket coincides with the classical intrinsic bracket given by identifying this complex with the space of coderivations of a certain cofree nilpotent @xmath49-coalgebra , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  ii.3.8 ) .",
    "the similar observation is true also for various types of `` bialgebras '' defined over quadratic ( in a suitable sense ) , such as lie bialgebras  @xcite , infinitesimal bialgebras  @xcite and @xmath51bialgebras  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , as we will see in section  [ gs ] , the gerstenhaber - schack complex of an @xmath3-bialgebra carries a fully fledged @xmath0-algebra structure .",
    ".3em * relation to previous results . * as indicated in the above paragraph , it is well - known that , for an algebra @xmath13 over a quadratic koszul operad @xmath1 , the cochain complex @xmath50 is a dg - lie algebra with the structure given by a generalization of schlessinger - stasheff s intrinsic bracket  @xcite . for algebras over a general operad ,",
    "an @xmath0-generalization of this structure was obtained by van  der  laan  @xcite as follows .",
    "van  der  laan noticed that , for each homotopy cooperad ( in an appropriate sense ) @xmath40 and for each operad @xmath52 , the @xmath39-module @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , is a homotopy operad ( again in an appropriate sense ) , which generalizes the convolution operad of  @xcite .",
    "he also proved that , for each homotopy operad @xmath55 , the `` total space '' @xmath56 has an induced @xmath0-structure which descents to an @xmath0-structure on the symmetrization @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath52 and @xmath40 as above , the graded vector space @xmath58 is a natural @xmath0-algebra .    on the other hand ,",
    "let @xmath59 be a minimal model of @xmath1 .",
    "van  der  laan observed that the differential @xmath12 makes the @xmath39-module of generators @xmath40 a homotopy cooperad and that , for @xmath60 , @xmath61 combining the above facts , he concluded that @xmath25 is a natural @xmath0-algebra and proved that the map @xmath62 defining the @xmath1-algebra @xmath13 determines a maurer - cartan element @xmath63 .",
    "he then constructed the @xmath0-structure on @xmath50 as the @xmath64-twisting , in the sense recalled in section  [ sh ] , of the @xmath0-algebra given by the identification  ( [ zavody_ve_dvore_zacaly_a_porad_prsi ] ) .",
    "we were recently informed about an on - going work  @xcite whose central statement proves the existence of an @xmath0-structure on the space of @xmath65-graded extended morphisms from a free dg  to an arbitrary  from which laan s arguments and their generalization to follow .    the methods of this article are independent of the above mentioned papers . while our approach is not very conceptual , it is straightforward and immediately produces , from a given differential in the minimal model , explicit formulas for the induced @xmath0-structure .    .3em * relation to derived spaces of algebra structures .",
    "* as argued in  @xcite , for an operad @xmath1 and a _ finite - dimensional _ vector space @xmath66 , there exists a scheme @xmath67 parameterizing @xmath1-algebra structures on @xmath66 .",
    "it is characterized by the property that for each commutative dg - algebra @xmath68 , morphisms @xmath69 are in bijection with @xmath70-algebra structures on the dg-@xmath68-module @xmath71 .",

    "the existence of an @xmath0-structure on @xmath80 would then follow from general properties of dg - schemes and is in fact equivalent to specifying a local coordinate system at the smooth point @xmath77 $ ] of @xmath73  ( * ? ? ?",

    "denote by @xmath82 the  @xmath83 considered as an @xmath16-module with the action induced by the homomorphism  @xmath84 .",
    "we will prove in theorem  [ e ] of section  [ 2bis ] that the desuspended space @xmath85 of derivations has a natural @xmath0-structure . by the definition  ( [ joshua_v_praze ] ) of @xmath86 ,",
    "theorem  [ main ] follows from theorem  [ e ] by taking @xmath16 a minimal model of the @xmath2 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 the composition @xmath89 , where @xmath5 describes the algebra @xmath13 and @xmath90 is the map of the minimal  model .    in the light of  (",
    "* proposition  2.5.8 ) , theorem  [ e ] translates to the statement that for each free dg-  @xmath16 and each homomorphism @xmath81 , the space @xmath91 forms a smooth dg - scheme .",
    "the derived scheme @xmath74 of  @xcite is then , for @xmath2 the operad @xmath1 and @xmath66 a finite - dimensional vector space , the specialization of this construction at the point represented by @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it this sense , the results of the present paper are meta - versions of constructions in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3.2 ) that completely avoid all assumptions required by the ` classical ' geometry , namely the fact that the target of the map @xmath84 is the endomorphism  of a finite - dimensional vector space .",
    "the present paper thus finishes the program to find a `` universal variety of structure constants '' formulated in  @xcite .    .3em",
    "* the master equation .",

    "one usually shows that an element @xmath95 , represented by a bilinear map ( or by a collection of bilinear maps ) , is a deformation of the @xmath1-algebra structure @xmath68 if and only if it solves the `` classical '' master equation @xmath96 $ ] .    for a ( bi)algebra @xmath13 over a general  @xmath2 , the cochain complex @xmath97 forms only an @xmath0-algebra , but we will prove , in section  [ sh ] , that solutions @xmath98 of the `` quantum '' master equation @xmath99 are deformations of @xmath13 .",
