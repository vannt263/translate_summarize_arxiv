    "there has been considerable discussion recently about strange matrix elements of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "much impetus for this was generated by the deep - inelastic scattering experiments with polarized targets at cern and more recently at slac @xcite , which seemed to imply a large polarized strange quark distribution in the proton . at about the same time",
    "a measurement of the elastic neutrino  proton scattering cross section @xcite at lower values of @xmath0 had also suggested a non - zero value for the strange axial vector form factor of the proton @xcite .",
    "these observations spurred many investigations of other processes in which traces of strangeness in the nucleon could be detected .",
    "it was argued @xcite for example that semi - leptonic neutral current scattering experiments could be used to extract the strange vector as well as axial vector form factors .",
    "parity - violating electron scattering experiments were proposed as a means of probing neutral current form factors @xcite . approved parity - violating experiments at mit - bates @xcite and",
    "jefferson lab @xcite will provide information on the strangeness form factors at low and intermediate @xmath0 values , and more precisely determine the strange radius and magnetic moment of the nucleon . at higher @xmath0",
    ", the ccfr collaboration @xcite has recently investigated a possible asymmetry between the strange and antistrange quark distributions in neutrino deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "perturbative qcd alone would be expected to produce identical @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions , while any asymmetry would imply the presence of non - perturbative effects in the nucleon at deep - inelastic scales .",
    "of course the strangeness content of the nucleon is not a scale - invariant concept  strange matrix elements are not renormalization group invariant . the evolution with @xmath0 of the moments of the polarized deep - inelastic strange quark distribution can be studied using the altarelli - parisi equations , so that a zero value for @xmath4 at a low scale is not necessarily incompatible with a non - zero value at a higher scale @xcite .",
    "naturally , extending such analyses to very low values of @xmath0 is problematic  at some stage non - perturbative techniques or models of qcd need to be invoked when describing data .",
    "recently tang and ji @xcite attempted to link the strangeness radius of the nucleon with the densities of strange and antistrange deep - inelastic quark distributions , arguing on the basis of quark `` locality '' that the distributions in coordinate space and momentum space should be correlated . in order to investigate this proposal more quantitatively , we will explore this relationship within a simple model , namely the meson cloud model .    in the meson cloud model ,",
    "the strangeness of the nucleon is assumed to be carried by the kaon ",
    "hyperon components of the physical nucleon .",
    "this model has in the past been utilized to calculate corrections to low energy nucleon properties @xcite , and has also been invoked to describe flavor symmetry breaking in nucleon sea quark distributions @xcite . however , direct comparison of results for the strange matrix elements in meson cloud models has thus far not been possible due to the fact that form factors and structure functions are usually calculated within different theoretical frameworks . while the natural framework for analyzing strange quark distributions is the light - cone @xcite , strange form factor calculations",
    "have usually been performed within covariant perturbation theory in instant - form quantization @xcite .",
    "( a light - cone constituent quark model was used in ref.@xcite to obtain the coupling of the photon to the kaon ",
    "hyperon cloud of the nucleon , however the kaon dressing itself was not described in terms of light - cone dynamics . )",
    "meaningful comparison of meson cloud corrections to light - cone quark distributions and low-@xmath0 form factors obviously requires a single framework to be used for both . in the present work we shall present for the first time a light - cone analysis of the strange nucleon form factors , using the same framework in which structure functions are calculated @xcite .",
    "we believe this is the only systematic way to test the hypothesis of ref.@xcite that the properties of the nucleon sea at low and high @xmath0 might somehow be correlated .",
    "in sec.ii we briefly outline the pertinent features of the meson cloud model on the light - cone .",
    "more detailed accounts can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we explain that the advantage of this framework lies in that it allows for a more consistent treatment of the hadronic meson  baryon vertex functions . unlike previous calculations within covariant perturbation theory , which have usually had to make _ ad hoc _ assumptions about the dependence of the vertex functions on various loop momenta",
    ", one can formally avoid this on the light - cone , while simultaneously satisfying charge and momentum conservation .",
    "the kaon cloud model is applied in sec.iii to the calculation of the @xmath0 dependence of the strange vector and axial vector form factors of the nucleon , from which the strangeness radius , strange magnetic moment and strange axial charge are extracted .",
    "sec.iv discusses the contribution from the kaon cloud to the deep - inelastic strange quark distribution , and to a possible strange  antistrange asymmetry in the nucleon .",
    "we find that the asymmetry is consistent with the latest neutrino deep - inelastic scattering data , within experimental errors .",
    "we also estimate the contribution to the polarized strange quark distribution from kaon loops . finally our findings are summarized in sec.v .",
    "the basic hypothesis of the meson cloud model of the nucleon is that the nucleon on the light - cone has internal meson and baryon degrees of freedom .",
    "the physical nucleon state ( momentum @xmath5 ) can then be expanded ( in the one - meson approximation ) as a series involving bare nucleon and two - particle meson  baryon states : @xmath6 the function @xmath7 is the probability amplitude for the physical nucleon @xmath8 to be in a state consisting of a baryon @xmath9 and meson @xmath10 , having transverse momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and carrying longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath13 and 1@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the bare nucleon probability is denoted by @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the @xmath17 coupling constant .",
    "the one - meson approximation in eq.([fock ] ) is valid as long as the meson cloud is relatively soft ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "it will progressively break down for harder @xmath17 vertex functions , at which point one will need to include two - meson and higher order fock state components in eq.([fock ] ) .",
    "the strangeness of the nucleon in this model is carried by the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc .",
    "fock state components , and we shall consider only these henceforth . therefore the properties of the bare nucleon state ( such as its intrinsic form factor , or its structure function ) will not be relevant for considerations of the nucleon strangeness content .",
    "for the sake of presentation we will consider the @xmath21 hyperon as representative in our discussions , although contributions from the @xmath22 will be included in the numerical results in secs.iii & iv .",
    "all expressions for the @xmath23 distributions can be obtained from the @xmath24 by appropriate replacement of masses , coupling constants and isospin factors .",
    "contributions from heavier mesons and hyperons , such as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , etc . can easily be added , although their role is insignificant as long as the @xmath17 vertex functions are not very hard @xcite .    according to eq.([fock ] ) , the probability to find a @xmath21 inside a nucleon with light - cone momentum fraction @xmath27 is given by the @xmath28 splitting function ( to leading order in the coupling constant ) : @xmath29 charge and momentum conservation require that this must also be the probability to find a kaon inside a nucleon with light - cone momentum fraction @xmath30 .",
    "the kaon distribution function , @xmath31 , should therefore be related to the baryon distribution function by @xmath32 for all @xmath27 , if the above interpretation is valid .",
    "this guarantees equal numbers of mesons emitted by the nucleon , @xmath33 , and virtual baryons accompanying them , @xmath34 :    [ cons ] @xmath35 this is just the statement that the nucleon has zero net strangeness .",
    "momentum conservation imposes the further requirement that @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the average momentum fractions carried by kaon and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "equations ( [ ncons ] ) and ( [ mcons ] ) , and in fact similar relations for all higher moments of @xmath39 , follow automatically from eq.([sym ] ) .",
    "any consistent treatment of the meson cloud model must therefore reproduce this symmetry relation .",
    "the advantage of a light - cone formulation @xcite is that one can construct a covariant framework in which eq.([sym ] ) is manifestly preserved , regardless of the dynamics of the meson  baryon system . if the dynamics are parametrized in terms of an effective hadronic meson  baryon vertex function , the symmetry relations ( [ sym])([cons ] ) can be satisfied if the vertex functions are functions of the invariant mass squared , @xmath40 , of the @xmath24 system : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the masses of @xmath21 and kaon , respectively , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 their four - momenta .",
    "note that the variable @xmath40 is related to the virtualities of the kaon ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath47 ) by : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 . a hadronic vertex function which is a function of @xmath40",
    "will automatically have the correct crossing symmetry structure in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 channels @xcite ( see eqs.([ff ] ) , ( [ fft ] ) below ) .    in instant - form calculations , on the other hand , the functions @xmath39 are usually evaluated in terms of @xmath53 vertex functions taken from fits to @xmath54 scattering data @xcite , where the vertex functions are assumed to depend only on the virtuality @xmath51 of the off - shell kaon .",
    "in this case the @xmath55 symmetry is lost , and the relation ( [ sym ] ) can not be maintained , making verification of the charge and momentum conservation relations , eqs.([cons ] ) , very difficult @xcite . actually , the non - preservation of the relation ( [ sym ] ) is not surprising since the splitting functions @xmath39 refer to probability distributions of specific _ particles _ , and a probabilistic interpretation does not hold in all reference frames ( since particle number is not preserved by lorentz boosts ) . indeed , for structured particles",
    "the factorization of the @xmath56 cross section itself into @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) cross sections is not valid in all frames of reference @xcite .",
    "such factorization , or convolution , can in fact only be achieved by eliminating antiparticle degrees of freedom , which can formally be done only in the infinite momentum frame @xcite , or on the light - cone .",
    "we will be interested in the strange matrix elements @xmath61 of operators @xmath62 , where @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "while these have been investigated in earlier studies within the meson cloud model @xcite , we will present here the first analysis of the strange form factors on the light - cone , in which the distribution functions of kaons and hyperons in the nucleon have the correct symmetry properties as specified in eq.([sym ] ) .",
    "this will be our main contribution to the form factor discussion .",
    "other aspects of the problem , such as the modeling of the intrinsic @xmath65 and @xmath21 form factors , or the truncation of the fock state expansion in eq.([fock ] ) , are not developed here beyond what exists already in the literature .",
    "the momentum dependence of the matrix elements of the strange vector current @xmath66 is conventionally written : @xmath67 where @xmath5 and @xmath68 are the initial and final nucleon momenta , and @xmath69 is the momentum transferred to the nucleon .",
    "the form factors @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the dirac and pauli strange form factors , and @xmath72 is the free dirac spinor of the nucleon . for convenience we work in a lorentz frame ( viz . the breit frame ) where the photon momentum @xmath73 is purely transverse , so that @xmath74 .",
    "the various particle momenta are parameterized as in ref.@xcite .",
    "zero net strangeness in the nucleon requires the vanishing of the dirac form factor at the on - shell photon point , @xmath75 . on the light - cone",
    "the form factors can be evaluated by choosing the @xmath76 ( or `` good '' ) component of the current @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "usually one introduces more convenient combinations of @xmath78 , in the form of the sachs electric ( @xmath79 ) and magnetic ( @xmath80 ) form factors :    @xmath81    the conventional definition of the strangeness radius of the nucleon is in terms of @xmath79 :    @xmath82    an alternative definition of the strangeness radius is in terms of the dirac form factor : @xmath83 the strange magnetic moment of the nucleon is defined by :    @xmath84    the contributions of the kaon cloud to the strange form factors are represented in fig.1 . to maintain the analogy with the structure function calculations in sec.iv",
    ", we will present the results for @xmath78 , and evaluate @xmath85 from these .",
    "therefore we define : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 refer to the @xmath21 and @xmath65 interaction diagrams in figs.1(a ) and ( b ) , respectively . the @xmath21 contribution to @xmath89",
    "can be written : @xmath90 where the @xmath21 light - cone distribution functions @xmath91 are :    [ f12l ] @xmath92    for the @xmath53 vertex we assume a pseudoscalar @xmath93 interaction ( the same results are obtained with a pseudovector coupling ) , with @xmath94 the coupling constant and @xmath95 the hadronic vertex function .",
    "note that identical expressions to these can be obtained using time - ordered perturbation theory in the infinite momentum frame @xcite .",
    "for the sign of the strangeness we adopt the convention of jaffe @xcite , so that @xmath96 is the strangeness charge of the @xmath21 . the intrinsic @xmath21 form factor @xmath97 contains possible @xmath0 dependence in the @xmath59 interaction vertex . the squared center of mass energies in eqs.([f12l ] )",
    "are :    @xmath98    with @xmath40 defined in eq.([m2 ] ) .",
    "the contributions to @xmath78 from the coupling to the kaon in fig.1(b ) are written : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is defined to be the strangeness charge of the kaon , and where the kaon light - cone distribution functions @xmath101 are :    [ f12k ] @xmath102    the @xmath24 squared center of mass energies are :    @xmath103    as discussed in sec.ii , on the light - cone it is natural to take the @xmath53 vertex function to be a function of @xmath104 , which guarantees local gauge invariance @xcite as well as energy - momentum conservation , as embodied in eq.([sym ] ) . in",
    "instant - form approaches gauge invariance has sometimes been enforced through introduction of seagull diagrams @xcite , which can be generated according to various prescriptions @xcite in order to satisfy the ward - takashi identity .",
    "however , as observed by musolf and burkardt @xcite , such prescriptions are not unique , since additional seagull terms which individually satisfy the ward - takahashi identity are also allowed .",
    "furthermore , inconsistencies with some of the prescriptions , when applied to loop calculations , have also recently been pointed out by wang and banerjee @xcite .    with @xmath40 dependent vertex functions the functions @xmath105 and @xmath106 in eqs.([f1k ] ) and ( [ f1l ] ) at @xmath107",
    "satisfy the relation ( [ sym ] ) explicitly , which they must because of strangeness conservation .",
    "the functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 at @xmath107 , on the other hand , do not need to satisfy such a relation , because they have their origin in the different spin couplings of the @xmath110 to the spin-0 @xmath65 and spin-1/2 @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , the contribution to the strange magnetic moment of the nucleon would be zero if @xmath111 exhibited such a symmetry . from eqs.([f2l ] ) and ( [ f2k ] ) one can see in fact that @xmath112 in the kaon cloud model is always @xmath113 .",
    "although it is clear that in order to preserve the relation ( [ sym ] ) the vertex function should be a function of the @xmath24 invariant mass , its specific functional dependence is not prescribed , and several forms have been suggested in the literature @xcite . in our numerical studies",
    "we will use a simple monopole - type function : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the cut - off mass parameter . in the light - cone formulation",
    "the cut - off directly determines the probability of finding the physical nucleon in a @xmath24 configuration , which provides a constraint on the range of @xmath115 for which the average kaon number density can be viewed as reliable .",
    "( in covariant instant - form calculations the probability for each individual fock state component is frame - dependent , since particle number is not invariant under lorentz boosts . ) for values larger than @xmath116 gev the average probability to find kaons in the nucleon would be @xmath117 , so that without including higher fock state components , the one - meson approximation in eq.([fock ] ) could not be considered trustworthy .",
    "therefore cut - off masses between @xmath118 and @xmath119 gev , for which @xmath120 37% , can be considered as representative of a reasonable range for which the model ( [ fock ] ) is a valid approximation ( for these values the corresponding probability to find pions in the nucleon is @xmath121 30%50% ) .    on the other hand",
    ", one can also try to constrain @xmath115 phenomenologically by fitting , within the kaon cloud model , the available strange quark distribution data @xcite , as well as the inclusive @xmath122 production data @xcite . for the monopole parametrization ( [ ff ] )",
    "one typically finds values of @xmath123 gev , with larger cut - offs difficult to accommodate @xcite ( see also sec.iv ) . in instant - form calculations @xcite",
    "one has often tried to connect the vertex function cut - offs with those obtained from @xmath124 potential model fits @xcite , where the vertex function is assumed to depend on the virtuality @xmath51 of the kaon , @xmath125 here the vertex function cut - offs are found to be typically @xmath126 1.21.5 gev .",
    "note that the form ( [ fft ] ) is an approximation to the @xmath40 dependent light - cone vertex function in eq.([ff ] ) , obtained by taking @xmath127 and @xmath128 , see eq.([stu ] ) .",
    "a typical value of @xmath129  gev would therefore correspond to @xmath130  gev .",
    "the function @xmath131 in eq.([fik ] ) , like @xmath97 in eq.([filam ] ) , reflects the possible @xmath0 dependence in the interaction vertex in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the simplest approximation is to assume point - like @xmath57 and @xmath59 couplings , @xmath132   @xcite .",
    "of course the virtual @xmath65 and @xmath21 do have finite size , and their coupling to @xmath110 should in reality exhibit some @xmath0 dependence . the most natural way to model this @xmath0 dependence is through the vector meson dominance model , in which the virtual photon at low @xmath0 couples to the kaon or @xmath21 through its fluctuations into correlated @xmath133 pairs @xcite . since the photon has @xmath134 , the states with the correct quantum numbers to which the @xmath110 can couple are the vector mesons , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath136 and @xmath137 mesons can act as an extra source of strangeness in the nucleon through this mechanism .",
    "a detailed treatment of the vector meson dominance model in strange form factors was presented in refs.@xcite , where it was found that @xmath138 increased by a factor @xmath139 with respect to the kaon loop only result ( @xmath112 is of course not affected by any changes in the @xmath0 dependence ) .",
    "other , quark - type models have also been used to estimate the intrinsic form factors of the bare particles @xcite . however , as outlined in sec.i , our aim here is more to explore the relationship between strange quark distributions in coordinate and momentum space within a single specific model , rather than present a comprehensive analysis of the form factors and structure functions themselves .",
    "therefore in order to avoid diluting the result from the kaon cloud model by introducing extra degrees of freedom into the calculation , for our purposes we will begin by investigating the contributions to the @xmath0 dependence of the strange form factors arising from kaon loops alone .    the @xmath0 dependence of the strange sachs electric and magnetic @xmath79 and @xmath80 form factors is shown in figs.2 and 3 for cut - off masses @xmath140 and @xmath119 gev .",
    "the values of the masses and couplings used in the numerical calculations are @xmath141 mev , @xmath142 mev , @xmath143 mev , @xmath144 mev and @xmath145 , @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "the results in figs.2 & 3 contain contributions from both @xmath24 and @xmath23 components , with the latter contributing @xmath147 of the total , which reflects the ratio @xmath148 expected from su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "contributions from @xmath149 loops to the strange form factors , where @xmath26 represents the @xmath150 decouplet hyperons , are suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude relative to the @xmath24 loops .",
    "the sign of @xmath79 is positive , while that of @xmath80 negative , in agreement with the instant - form kaon cloud model results of refs.@xcite .",
    "the magnitude depends strongly on @xmath115 , although even for the largest cut - off of @xmath119 gev it is still somewhat smaller than in refs.@xcite .",
    "the strangeness ( sachs ) radius is found to be small and negative , ranging from @xmath151 @xmath152 for @xmath153 gev to @xmath154 @xmath152 for @xmath155 gev .",
    "this is slightly smaller than that obtained in previous kaon cloud model calculations @xcite , although still within the same order of magnitude .",
    "the strange dirac radius is somewhat smaller still , @xmath156 @xmath152 for the two cut - off masses .",
    "the strange magnetic moment is also found to be negative as in earlier studies @xcite although somewhat smaller , @xmath157 . to obtain the same numerical values for",
    "the form factors and radii as in refs.@xcite would require values for the vertex function cut - off of @xmath158 gev , as seen in fig.4 , where the @xmath115 dependence of @xmath138 , @xmath159 and @xmath112 is plotted ( note that @xmath112 is scaled down by a factor 10 ) .",
    "for such hard vertex functions , however , one would find it difficult to be consistent with the data on the @xmath2@xmath3 asymmetry , as we shall discuss in the next section .",
    "furthermore , the average number of kaons in the nucleon for such a cut - off mass would be @xmath160 , which is clearly beyond the limits of a perturbative treatment of the meson cloud .",
    "the matrix elements of the strange axial vector current @xmath161 are parametrized in terms of the axial form factors @xmath162 : and @xmath163 : @xmath164 the strange pseudoscalar form factor @xmath165 is not observable in semi - leptonic neutral current reactions @xcite , and is therefore not considered here .",
    "because the kaon has spin 0 , the strange axial vector form factor @xmath166 receives contributions only from the @xmath59 coupling in fig.1(a ) . in this case one has : @xmath167 where the light - cone axial distribution function @xmath168 is given by : @xmath169 the @xmath0 dependence of the axial @xmath166 form factor is shown in fig.5 for three values of the @xmath53 vertex function cut - off , @xmath140 and @xmath119 gev . at zero transferred momentum the ratio @xmath170 where @xmath171 from nucleon @xmath172-decays , measures the strange isovector axial charge of the proton . for @xmath53 vertex function factor cut - offs between @xmath118 and @xmath119 gev , @xmath173",
    "is found to be very small , ranging between @xmath174 and 0.002 .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath173 ( and @xmath166 ) is _ positive _ , becoming negative only for @xmath175 gev , as seen in fig.5 . as we discuss in more detail in sec.iv b",
    ", this fact illustrates that kaon loops alone can not explain the apparent large strange component of the proton spin .",
    "the meson cloud model of the nucleon has been successful in providing understanding of the origin of some of the symmetry breaking amongst the proton s sea quark distributions observed in recent experiments .",
    "a pion cloud , for example , naturally allows one to account for the excess of @xmath176 quarks over @xmath177 in the proton @xcite . in a similar vein ,",
    "the kaon cloud of the nucleon gives rise to the observed su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking in the proton sea @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it also leads to different strange and antistrange quark distributions in the nucleon , as first pointed out by signal and thomas @xcite .",
    "this question has recently come to prominence again with the availability of new neutrino and antineutrino deep - inelastic scattering data , which were analyzed for a possible non - zero @xmath2@xmath3 difference @xcite .",
    "such an asymmetry arises naturally in a kaon cloud picture of the nucleon , since the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks have quite different origins in this model .",
    "indeed , it has been argued @xcite that because the @xmath2 quark comes from the @xmath21 , its distribution should be valence - like , while the @xmath3 , originating in the lighter kaon , should be much softer and resemble a typical sea distribution .",
    "on the other hand , the experimental @xmath178 ratio was found to be consistent , within large errors , with unity , @xmath179 , prompting suggestions @xcite that the meson cloud model is ruled out by these data .    in this section",
    "we discuss how the above argument is modified when one takes into account the different @xmath65 and @xmath21 distribution functions in the nucleon .",
    "the difference @xmath2@xmath3 turns out to be very sensitive to the details of the hadronic vertex functions used in calculating these distributions .",
    "when calculated consistently in terms of the light - cone vertex functions discussed in the previous sections , the kaon cloud model predicts a very small excess of @xmath3 over @xmath2 at large @xmath1 , which is not in contradiction with the neutrino deep - inelastic data @xcite .      within the same impulse approximation in which the form factors in sec.iii are calculated ,",
    "the deep - inelastic quark distribution ( at a scale @xmath180 ) in the meson cloud model can be written as a one - dimensional convolution of the meson or hyperon light - cone distribution function and the intrinsic quark distribution in the meson or hyperon .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quark distributions , generated from figs.1(a ) and ( b ) , respectively , can be written @xcite :    [ conv ] @xmath181    where the @xmath28 splitting functions are related to the @xmath21 and @xmath65 distribution functions in eqs.([f1l ] ) and ( [ f1k ] ) by :    [ fdis ] @xmath182    the net strangeness in the nucleon being zero implies that the distributions must be normalized such that : @xmath183 as can be explicitly verified from eqs.([conv ] ) .",
    "as for the intrinsic form factors of the virtual @xmath65 and @xmath21 , the intrinsic @xmath65 and @xmath21 structure functions are essentially unknown .",
    "however , the advantage of the light - cone approach is that the intermediate state particles are on - mass - shell , thus allowing the on - mass - shell structure functions of the kaon and @xmath21 to be used @xcite . in a covariant instant - form formulation where the @xmath65 and @xmath21 are off their mass shells",
    ", one needs to make additional assumptions about the extrapolation of the structure functions into the off - shell region , and indeed about the definition of the structure function of an off - shell @xmath65 or @xmath21 itself @xcite . according to the usual prescription adopted in the literature , in the instant - form calculations",
    "it is usually simply assumed that the off - mass - shell structure function is the same as that on - shell . while possibly a reasonable approximation for heavy baryons , the justification for such an ansatz is certainly not clear for the kaon , which is typically much further off - mass - shell .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution in kaons is obtained from measurements of final states in inclusive @xmath184 target @xmath185 reactions , where @xmath186 in drell - yan production @xcite , or @xmath187 in inclusive meson production @xcite .",
    "one finds that the ratio of the @xmath65 structure function to the much better determined @xmath188 structure function @xcite is consistent with unity over most of the range of @xmath1 , dropping slightly at large @xmath1 , @xmath189 @xcite . for the @xmath2 quark distributions in @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "one can expect the su(3 ) symmetric relations @xmath190 and @xmath191 to be reasonable approximations .    with these distribution functions , and the splitting functions in eqs.([f12l ] ) , ( [ f12k ] ) and ( [ fdis ] ) ,",
    "the resulting @xmath2@xmath3 asymmetry is plotted in fig.6 at @xmath192 gev@xmath193 , for different values of the @xmath53 vertex function cut - off , @xmath194 and @xmath119 gev .",
    "( note that it would not be meaningful to compare the calculated @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions in eq.([conv ] ) separately with the structure function data , since the distributions calculated in the kaon cloud model do not contain any contributions from the perturbative process @xmath195 . )",
    "the asymmetry in the kaon cloud model turns out to be very small , and for not too large values of @xmath115 , broadly consistent with the ccfr experiment within the given errors @xcite .",
    "to obtain the difference @xmath2@xmath3 we have used the absolute values of @xmath196 from the parametrizations of refs.@xcite .",
    "we should point out , however , that there exists some controversy regarding the overall normalization of the deep - inelastic neutrino data from which the strange quark distribution was extracted , resulting from an apparent inconsistency between the neutrino data and data on inclusive charm production @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ccfr data were collected with fe nuclei targets , so that one needs to consider possible nuclear emc corrections in the data analysis @xcite before making any definitive conclusions about the @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions . in view of these uncertainties in the data themselves",
    ", one can certainly not conclude that the meson cloud model is inconsistent with the data from deep - inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "the sign of the difference @xmath2@xmath3 is very sensitive to the vertex function used at the @xmath53 vertex . with a vertex function that depends only on the virtuality of the off - mass - shell kaon , such as in eq.([fft ] ) ,",
    "the covariant perturbation theory calculation @xcite leads to @xmath197 at large @xmath1 .",
    "the origin of this difference can be traced back to the fact that the light - cone @xmath65 distribution function peaks at larger values of @xmath27 compared with the instant - form distribution with the vertex function ( [ fft ] ) , which is somewhat less symmetric about @xmath198 , fig.7 . upon convoluting the more symmetric light - cone distribution with the @xmath199 and @xmath200 distributions , the @xmath201 behavior of @xmath199 and the harder @xmath202 behavior of @xmath200",
    "are translated into a harder overall @xmath3 distribution compared with the @xmath2 . on the other hand , since at small @xmath27 the instant - form distribution @xmath203 , the original @xmath1 dependence in @xmath199 and @xmath200 is skewed to such an extent that the resulting @xmath2 distribution actually becomes dominant at large @xmath1 . as discussed in sec.ii , however , the instant - form function @xmath204 , evaluated with the @xmath51-dependent vertex function ( [ fft ] ) , does not satisfy the probability conservation relation in eq.([sym ] ) .",
    "hence we believe that the results for the @xmath2@xmath3 difference in fig.6 are more realistic for the light - cone distribution functions .      given the simplicity with which one can describe symmetry breaking in the nucleon s sea quark distributions with the meson cloud model , it is tempting to attribute the large violation of the ellis - jaffe sum rule @xcite to a kaon cloud of the nucleon . by carrying away some orbital angular momentum of the nucleon , a kaon cloud could naively be expected to reduce the intrinsic spin carried by quarks , and give rise to a negatively polarized strange quark distribution , @xmath205 .",
    "the effect of the meson cloud on the polarized nucleon quark distributions has been addressed by several authors @xcite .",
    "although the kaon cloud picture can provide a simple framework within which the non - perturbative sea could be understood qualitatively , it is clearly important to determined whether such a picture can provide , or even be consistent with , a more quantitative description . in view of the sensitivity of the sign and magnitude of the strange form factors and the unpolarized @xmath2@xmath3 difference to the hadronic vertex functions , we shall use the light - cone framework to re - examine the question of what role kaons play in the proton spin problem .",
    "the contribution to the polarized strange quark distribution in the nucleon from kaon loops can be written :    [ dconv ] @xmath206    where @xmath207 is zero for the same reason that the @xmath166 form factor receives contributions only from the @xmath59 interaction diagram in fig.1(a ) .",
    "the helicity - dependent @xmath208 splitting function is given by : @xmath209 with @xmath210 defined in eq.([dfl ] ) .",
    "if one had available information about the spin - dependent @xmath1-distribution of the strange quark in the bare @xmath21 , one could predict the resulting @xmath1-dependence of @xmath205 arising from kaon loops .",
    "unfortunately , there is no information about polarized quark distributions in any hadron other than the nucleon .",
    "nevertheless , one can still get an estimate of the size of the kaon loop contribution by considering the first moment of @xmath205 . in the su(6 ) symmetric model the spin of the @xmath21 is carried entirely by the @xmath2 quark .",
    "it may seem reasonable therefore to expect that @xmath211 at some low scale @xmath180 , even taking into account su(6 ) symmetry - breaking effects , or some of the spin residing on gluons or in the form of angular momentum .",
    "evolution to larger values of @xmath180 would imply that @xmath212 @xcite . in this case",
    "the total strange quark contribution to the proton spin would be : @xmath213 for cut - offs @xmath1181.3 gev this would give @xmath214 .",
    "this is to be compared with values @xmath215 quoted in connection with determinations of @xmath4 from the spin - dependent structure functions in ref.@xcite .",
    "these results therefore suggest that a kaon cloud alone can not be expected to reproduce the observed deviation from the ellis - jaffe sum rule .",
    "other mechanisms for generating a non - zero @xmath4 , such as ones based on the gluon axial u(1 ) anomaly , need to be invoked to account for the data .",
    "we have presented a framework for studying strange form factors and quark distributions of the nucleon consistently in terms of the meson cloud model .",
    "working on the light - cone , one avoids many of the problems and ambiguities associated with the choice of momentum dependent hadronic vertex functions encountered in instant - form calculations .    within the uncertainty range of the input parameters , the strangeness ( sachs ) radius",
    "is found to be very small and negative , in the vicinity @xmath216 @xmath152 for @xmath53 vertex function cut - offs of @xmath153@xmath119 gev .",
    "the strange dirac radius is somewhat smaller , @xmath217 @xmath152 .",
    "the strange magnetic moment is found to be @xmath157 , which is two to three times smaller than in previous estimates .",
    "the strange axial vector charge is also small , @xmath218 , but in addition comes with the opposite sign compared with instant - form calculations with the meson cloud model .",
    "combined , these results suggest that the strangeness content of the nucleon at low @xmath0 is indeed very small , and may represent a challenge to experimentalists seeking to verify its presence .    using the same light - cone framework , we have estimated the asymmetry between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quark distributions in the nucleon , which has been the subject of recent experimental investigation @xcite .",
    "we find the magnitude of the @xmath2@xmath3 difference to be very small , with the @xmath3 distribution slightly harder than the @xmath2 , but somewhat sensitive to the shape of the hadronic @xmath53 vertex function . within the current experimental errors",
    "this is consistent with the recent experimental determination of the asymmetry from neutrino deep - inelastic scattering , if moderately soft @xmath53 vertex functions are used .",
    "for very hard vertex functions , the predicted asymmetry seems to be somewhat large in comparison with the data of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , to be more definitive , more statistics on the charm production data are needed , and the apparent discrepancy between the inclusive deep - inelastic muon and neutrino data and those on @xmath219 production must be resolved @xcite . finally , the contribution of the kaon cloud to the polarized @xmath4 quark distribution is very small and _ positive _ , @xmath220 , and therefore is unlikely to feature prominently in any final explanation of the proton spin puzzle .    aside from the experimental uncertainties , the small values for both",
    "the slope of the strangeness form factor and the @xmath2@xmath3 difference within the simple model considered here gives some support to the suggestion of ref.@xcite that the coordinate and momentum space strange quark distributions are correlated .",
    "this relationship will be clarified when new , more precise data from deep - inelastic neutrino scattering become available .",
    "measurement of the @xmath0 dependence of strange matrix elements at low and intermediate values of @xmath0 at mit - bates , jefferson lab and elsewhere will also be very valuable @xcite .",
    "the dynamical source of intrinsic strangeness can also be explored in semi - inclusive experiments involving coincidence measurement of scattered leptons and specific hadronic final states @xcite .",
    "measurement of the spin transfer from target protons to recoiling @xmath21 hyperons in the target fragmentation region could discriminate between kaon cloud models , in which the spins are highly correlated , and parton fragmentation models , for which the correlations are very weak @xcite .",
    "similar effects have also been discussed in hadronic reactions , @xmath221 @xcite . while the upcoming experiments will be difficult , if successful they should provide quite important information on the role of strangeness in the nucleon , as well as its dynamical origin .",
