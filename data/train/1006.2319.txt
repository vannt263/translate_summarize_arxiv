    "roughly speaking , this approach requires finding periodic functions @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and under some conditions on the dependence of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath8 , it guarantees the existence of some periodic solution @xmath9 between them .    as a model",
    ", we may think on the @xmath1-periodic problem for the _ damped pendulum equation _ :",
    "@xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are given parameters . we observe that @xmath13 are , respectively , lower and upper solutions .",
    "they enclose the @xmath3periodic solution @xmath14 , which is unstable .",
    "moreover , this equation possesses other solutions which are asymptotic to @xmath9 ; infinitely many in the past and also infinitely many in the future .",
    "a second look at this example shows that @xmath15 also make up an ordered pair of lower and upper solutions .",
    "this time there are several periodic solutions , with different dynamics , between them .",
    "for instance , @xmath16 is stable in the future ( throughout this paper stability is understood in the the lyapunov sense ) .",
    "but the _ minimal _ and the _ maximal _ periodic solutions of ( [ eu00 ] ) which lie between @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , respectively , @xmath19 and both of them are unstable ( we call instability to the logical negation of lyapunov stability ) . indeed , both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are again the limit of infinitely many asymptotic solutions .",
    "in this paper we generalize this fact for more general equations ( [ eu0 ] ) having an ordered pair @xmath4 of periodic lower and upper solutions . assuming that , for instance , @xmath22 does * not * solve our equation ( [ eu0 ] ) we show that the minimal periodic solution @xmath20 lying between @xmath22 and @xmath23 is unstable",
    "; moreover , it is the limit of many asymptotic solutions , in the past and in the future ( theorem [ th1 ] and corollary [ cor1 ] ) .",
    "of course , a similar statement holds for the maximal periodic solution @xmath21 if @xmath23 does not solve ( [ eu0 ] ) .",
    "this result raises the question about the case in which @xmath24 are ordered @xmath3_periodic solutions _ of our equation ( [ eu0 ] ) .",
    "is it still possible to find an unstable solution between them ?",
    "the answer is affirmative in the conservative case @xmath25 ( corollary [ cor3 ] ) . for general , derivative - depending equations it may not true , but we shall see that when the periodic solutions are _ neighboring _ , then one of them must be unstable and possess many asymptotic solutions ( theorem [ th2 ] and corollary [ cor2 ] ) .",
    "the instability of the periodic solutions obtained by the method of lower and upper solutions was previously studied by dancer and ortega @xcite .",
    "when the lower and upper solutions are strict and the number of periodic solutions between them is finite , they showed that at least one of them must be unstable .",
    "this result was obtained as an application of a general theorem on the index of stable fixed points in two dimensions whose proof depended on a nonelementary result of planar topology : brouwer s lemma on translation arcs .    even though the main result of this paper can be seen as a generalization of proposition 3.1 of @xcite , our approach , which is inspired on the aubry - mather theory as presented by moser @xcite ,",
    "is based on the more elementary concepts of maximal and minimal solutions of dirichlet and periodic boundary value problems .",
    "moreover , we do not need to assume the finiteness of the set of periodic solutions comprised between the lower and upper solutions and we shall obtain more precise information on the dynamics : the existence of branches of asymptotic solutions .",
    "this paper is distributed in five sections . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we make precise the framework which we shall use and collect some basic facts on upper and lower solutions which will be needed in the proofs .",
    "we do not pretend any originality in this section , whose contents are mostly well - known in slightly different frameworks . to keep the pace of the exposition , the proofs of these results",
    "will be postponed to the appendix ( section [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "the main results of this paper are stated and proved in sections [ sec3 ] ( where we study the dynamics between an ordered pair of lower and upper solutions ) and [ sec4 ] ( devoted to the dynamics between two ordered solutions ) .    some remarks on the notation ( previously employed ) .",
    "through most of the paper the greek letters @xmath22 and @xmath23 will be kept , respectively , for lower and upper solutions ; however , in section [ sec4 ] they will represent two ordered periodic solutions .",
    "we shall also utilize different notations to distinguish solutions depending on the kind of boundary conditions that they satisfy . in this way",
    ", periodic solutions will be usually written as @xmath9 , the letter @xmath26 will be used to emphasize that our solution satisfies some dirichlet conditions , and @xmath27 will stand for other solutions , not necessarily verifying any particular boundary condition . finally , it will be convenient to adopt the following convention : given functions @xmath28 defined on respective domains @xmath29 , and some set @xmath30 , we shall simply say @xmath31 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath32 ) on @xmath33 instead of @xmath34 ( resp . , @xmath35 ) for any @xmath36 .",
    "when there is no possible ambiguity on the domain we shall say @xmath31 or @xmath32 meaning that the inequality holds pointwise . given functions @xmath37 we shall say that _",
    "@xmath38 lies between @xmath27 and @xmath39 on @xmath40 _ to mean @xmath41 on @xmath40 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that periodic minimizers are unstable .",
    "i am indebted to prof .",
    "p. omari for pointing out to me that it implies the instability of periodic solutions given by the lower and upper solutions method when the problem has a variational structure and formulating the question about the nonvariational case .",
    "last but not least , i want to express my gratitude to prof . r.",
    "ortega directing me to moser s book @xcite , as well as for his invaluable advice on many aspects of this paper , including the regularity result on lower and upper solutions described in the appendix .",
    "in this paper , the nonlinearity @xmath42 , @xmath43 will _ always _ be assumed to be continuous and @xmath1-periodic in time .",
    "the function @xmath44 is called a _",
    "lower solution _ of the periodic problem @xmath45 provided that it is lipschitz - continuous and @xmath1-periodic , and verifies the inequality @xmath46 in the distributional sense on the real line . with other words , @xmath47 for any nonnegative @xmath48 having compact support .",
    "upper solutions @xmath23 are defined similarly after changing the sign of inequalities ( [ eu1],[eu2 ] ) .    of course , if @xmath22 is a @xmath49 function , then ( [ eu2 ] ) is equivalent to ( [ eu1 ] ) holding pointwise .",
    "but the definition above includes also some functions displaying angles .",
    "we point out an example which will be used later .",
    "let @xmath50\\to\\mathbb r$ ] be a solution of our equation ( [ eu0 ] ) such that @xmath51 but @xmath52 , and extend it to the real line by periodicity .",
    "the resulting , piecewise @xmath49 function , is a lower solution of @xmath53 , as one may easily check using an integration - by - parts argument .",
    "notice also that our concepts of lower and upper solutions are nonstrict ; periodic solutions are examples of lower and upper solutions .",
    "the distributional notion of lower and upper solutions adopted in this paper is routinely used in pde problems but may seem unnecessarily general here . indeed , our main arguments could be carried out using only piecewise-@xmath49 lower and upper solutions , even though the results obtained in this way would lose some generality .",
    "our choice will imply some relatively small variations with respect to other versions in the literature when showing the results of this section , but otherwise it will not lead to additional difficulties in the proofs .",
    "incidentally we observe that lower and upper solutions in the distributional sense must be somewhat more regular than merely lipschitz - continuous ; for instance , the derivative should have side limits at each point ( it will be shown in the proof of lemma [ ml ] in the appendix ) .",
    "if @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath8 , then the existence of an ordered pair @xmath4 of lower and upper solutions for @xmath53 implies the existence of a solution between them .",
    "however , this result fails to hold for general , derivative - dependent nonlinearities as considered in this paper , see @xcite , example 4.1 , pp .",
    "43 - 44 . to ensure that the method of lower and upper solutions works for @xmath53 one must add some further condition , which may consist on a special form of our equation ( the rayleigh equation , the linard equation ... ) or some assumption on the growth of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath8 ( such as the bernstein condition or some kind of nagumo condition ) ; see @xcite , chapter i , section 4 for a detailed study of all these possibilities . in this paper",
    "we opt for the classical , two - sided nagumo condition :    1 .   there exists a continuous function @xmath55 with @xmath56 and such that @xmath57 if @xmath58    this assumption makes the usual existence result for the periodic method of lower and upper solutions hold :    [ prop0 ] let @xmath53 have an ordered pair @xmath4 of lower and upper solutions and assume * [ n]*. then there exists a solution @xmath9 of @xmath53 with @xmath59 .",
    "lower and upper solutions are nowadays standard notions , and have been studied in depth",
    ". we shall be particularly interested on the structure of the set of solutions of @xmath53 lying between a given ordered pair @xmath4 of lower and upper solutions .",
    "this set always contains a minimal and a maximal solution , and the following improvement of proposition [ prop0 ] is well - known :    [ upp - low]let @xmath53 have an ordered pair @xmath4 of lower and upper solutions and assume * [ n]*. then there are solutions @xmath60 of @xmath53 with @xmath61 and such that any third solution @xmath9 of @xmath53 with @xmath62 verifies @xmath63    since the dependence of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath64 was only required to be continuous , initial value problems associated to our equation ( [ eu0 ] ) may have many periodic solutions .",
    "sometimes we shall merely look for global branches of asymptotic solutions to a given periodic motion and it will be not problematic . but other results of this paper explicitly deal with the instability of certain periodic solutions ; in these cases , uniqueness for initial value problems will be assumed in combination with * [ n]*. we emphasize a connection between these assumptions and the method of lower and upper solutions :    [ prop1]assume that there is uniqueness for initial value problems associated to ( [ eu0 ] ) and @xmath4 are lower and upper solutions of @xmath53 . finally ,",
    "assume also * [ n]*. then either @xmath65 for any @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "concerning this result we remark that the lower and upper solutions @xmath68 are * not * assumed to be strict .",
    "in particular , it also applies when either @xmath22 or @xmath23 are periodic solutions .",
    "we shall use this form of proposition [ prop1 ] in the proof of corollary [ cor1 ] .    in this paper we shall also consider dirichlet - type boundary value problems : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are given . by a lower solution to @xmath72 we mean a lipschitz - continuous function @xmath73\\to\\mathbb r$ ] such that @xmath74 and ( [ eu1 ] ) holds in the distributional sense on @xmath75 . with other words , a lipschitz - continuous function @xmath22 verifying ( [ eu4 ] ) and such that ( [ eu2 ] ) holds for any nonnegative @xmath48 with compact support contained in @xmath75 .",
    "upper solutions @xmath23 for this problem are then defined similarly by changing the sign of the inequalities .    in this framework",
    "it is also well - known that the presence of an ordered pair of lower and upper solutions does not necessarily imply the existence of a solution between them .",
    "we might use a related nagumo condition , but for the purposes of this paper it will suffice to consider the more restrictive class of nonlinearities which are bounded between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i.e. , there exists some constant @xmath76 such that @xmath77 $ ] .",
