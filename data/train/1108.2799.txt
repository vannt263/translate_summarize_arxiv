    "the existence of an equilibrium phase transition into the spin glass ( sg ) phase has not yet been convincingly established for some spin glasses .",
    "the development of the _ parallel tempered _",
    "monte carlo ( tmc ) algorithm @xcite has enabled one to observe , bypassing anomalously long relaxation processes , sg models in _ equilibrium _ at low temperatures .",
    "thus , correlation lengths @xmath11 have been determined from the equilibrium behavior of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is for a spin at site @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for a thermal average and for an average over quenched randomness , respectively .",
    "there is evidence , from monte carlo simulations , that @xmath11 grows as linear system size @xmath17 in ( i ) the edwards - anderson ( ea ) model@xcite at some nonzero temperature @xmath6 in three dimensions , in ( ii ) geometrically frustrated systems , such as strongly site - diluted ising models , with nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic ( af ) bonds , on fcc lattices , @xcite and in ( iii ) strongly site - diluted ising models with dipole - dipole interactions , such as in liho@xmath18y@xmath19f@xmath20 .",
    "@xcite we refer to the latter systems as disordered ising dipolar ( did ) systems.@xcite at least for did systems , some numerical evidence that is unfavorable for the existence of a phase transition also exists.@xcite the divergence of @xmath11 implies the divergence of the so called spin - glass susceptibility @xmath1 at @xmath6 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the number of spins .",
    "convincing experimental evidence for the existence of an equilibrium phase transition into the sg phase is harder to obtain .",
    "this is mainly ( i ) because very long relaxation processes make equilibrium observations difficult , and ( ii ) because neither @xmath11 nor @xmath1 can be directly observed . instead , the sg transition is usually characterized by the nonlinear magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite it is defined by @xmath23 assuming @xmath24 .",
    "canella and mydosh@xcite were first able to measure ( in gold - iron alloys ) huge values of @xmath10 : @xmath25 ( from here on , we let boltzmann s constant and bohr s magneton equal @xmath26 ) near @xmath27 .",
    "later , @xmath28 was shown @xcite to diverge in other canonical sgs as a power of @xmath29 .",
    "for the ea model,@xcite originally inspired by the discovery of canella and mydosh , chalupa @xcite showed long ago that @xmath30 if no field is applied .",
    "thus , the critical behavior of @xmath10 and @xmath1 , which one observes in simulations , can , at least for the ea model , be clearly related to the critical behavior of @xmath10 , which one observes experimentally .",
    "the three models we study are governed by the hamiltonian , @xmath31 where the sum is over all @xmath14 and @xmath32 lattice sites , @xmath33 is model specific , @xmath34 is a quenched random variable , and @xmath35 is a ( @xmath36 ) ising spin at site @xmath14 .",
    "all sites are occupied with the same probability , @xmath37 , where the @xmath38 subscript stands for a quenched average over all site occupancy arrangements .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find how @xmath39 , an experimentally measured quantity , and @xmath1 , a quantity which is often calculated , are related in site - diluted sgs .",
    "more specifically , numerical results from tmc are sought for ( i ) ising spins , with ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) interactions,@xcite which are randomly located on a small fraction of all lattice sites , ( ii ) a geometrically - frustrated ising spin system , mainly , randomly located ising spins , with nearest neighbor af interactions , on a @xmath4 fraction of all sites of an fcc lattice , and ( iii ) did systems on a small fraction of all lattice sites .",
    "the outcome of these calculations is unknown , because eq . ( [ cuatro ] ) has not been derived for site diluted sgs . on the other hand , @xmath10 and @xmath1",
    "can exhibit the same critical behavior in site diluted sgs if they and the ea model belong to the same universality class .",
    "this has been predicted@xcite to be so for the first of the above three models , but not so , as far as we know , for the other two models.@xcite    an outline of the paper follows .",
    "details about the procedure we follow in our calculations are given in sec .",
    "[ pro ] . for various sizes of each of these systems ,",
    "we obtain @xmath40 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 .",
    "data for @xmath40 is used to establish the phase transition temperature @xmath6 between the paramagnetic and sg phases .",
    "we then compare how @xmath1 and @xmath10 vary with system size and with temperature in the vicinity of @xmath6 .",
    "the results obtained for each system are given in each of the subsections of sec .",
    "[ results ] . very briefly , these results follow .",
    "we find that @xmath10 approximately follows eq .",
    "( [ uno ] ) in strongly diluted systems of ising spins with rkky interactions . on the other hand , @xmath5 is a over a couple of orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath1 in a ( @xmath41 ) site - diluted af ising model on an fcc lattice .",
    "nevertheless , both @xmath10 and @xmath1 appear to have the same critical behavior . finally , in did systems , @xmath5 and @xmath1 seem to diverge similarly at @xmath6 .",

    "to calculate @xmath10 , we make use of @xmath49 where @xmath50 , which holds for @xmath51 .",

    "this is justified for finite systems with up - down symmetry if averages are taken over infinite times , since @xmath56 then for all odd @xmath57 .",
    "the order in which system sizes and averaging times are taken to infinity is irrelevant for the paramagnetic phase",
    ". equations ( [ cuatro ] ) and ( [ mn ] ) , as well as all the results below are only claimed to hold for @xmath58 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ mn ] ) is valid for each realization of quenched disorder .",
    "chalupa derived eq .",
    "( [ cuatro ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ mn ] ) for the ea model by first averaging over all system samples , and noting ( i ) that both @xmath59 and @xmath60 involve sums over four - spin terms , such as @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , and ( ii ) that any term in which one or more subindices is unpaired vanishes . to see this ,",
    "assume the @xmath63 index is unpaired in either of the two sums over @xmath64 indices .",
    "now , consider all exchange bonds @xmath65 between the @xmath63-th and any other site .",
    "let s assume the probabilities for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for all @xmath67 while all other exchange constants remain unchanged are equal .",
    "( this requires exchange bonds to be _ independently _ random . )",
    "it follows that the probabilities for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for any given configuration of all the other spins , are equal .",
    "this is the gist of the proof . for further details ,",
    "the proof fails for site - diluted systems , because exchange bonds are not then _ independently _ random .",
    "we simulate a set of identical systems at temperatures @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 following standard tmc rules .",
    "@xcite we choose @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and all @xmath75 such that at least @xmath76 of all attempted exchanges between systems at @xmath3 and @xmath77 are successful for all @xmath3 .",
    "we let each system equilibrate for a time @xmath78 and take averages over an equally long subsequent time @xmath78 .",

    "the point where @xmath40 curves for various system sizes meet as @xmath3 decreases defines @xmath6 for us .",
    "all systems we report on below have a common feature : fractional errors for @xmath10 are an order of magnitude larger than the ones for @xmath1 and for @xmath88 . unless otherwise stated , error bars are given for @xmath10 and related quantities , but not for @xmath1 or @xmath89 , which are all smaller than icons for their data points .",
    ".the number of samples @xmath81 and the number of monte carlo sweeps @xmath78 that were taken both for equilibration and for the subsequent averaging times are given in thousands of monte carlo sweeps .",
    "there are @xmath90 lattice sites in rkky and fcc systems , but @xmath91 lattice sites for did systems .

    "since only a single state comes into the calculation , no monte carlo simulation is necessary .",
    "this enables us to calculate @xmath93 for very large systems .",
    "the fact that only an @xmath82 fraction of lattice sites are occupied in site diluted sgs is _ approximately _ taken into account by letting @xmath98 everywhere .",
    "inhomogeneities in sgs are thus neglected .",

    "these curves do not fit the data points too well . on the other hand , a good fit for small system sizes",
    "should not be expected .",
    "we can nevertheless conclude with some confidence that @xmath92 does not diverge as @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , @xmath101 is most likely within the @xmath103 range .",
    "furthermore , observation of fig .",
    "[ theory]b indicates that @xmath104 at @xmath27 varies over three or four orders of magnitude as system shape varies from cubic to infinitely thin needle - like .",

    "finally , note that the classical or quantum nature of did systems does not play any role in this section .",
    "it does not matter either whether a transverse field is applied , because it does not affected up - down symmetry .",
    "these equations can therefore be applied , as an illustration , to li@xmath107ho@xmath18y@xmath20 , under a transverse field , as in ref .",

    "by the tempered monte carlo method@xcite we have tested whether the relation @xmath2 , which is known@xcite to hold for the edwards - anderson model , also holds for several site - diluted spin glasses of ( @xmath36 ) ising spins , with ( i ) rkky interactions , ( ii ) antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbor spins on fcc lattices , and ( iii ) dipole - dipole interactions . as a byproduct",

    "this suggests @xmath116 and @xmath7 have the same critical behavior .",
    "since the rkky interaction decays as the inverse of the cube of the distance , these results must hold for lower values of @xmath82 if the temperature is scaled with @xmath82 .",
