    "one may wonder whether mcmullen s result is valid without the hypothesis that @xmath49 is bounded , namely is it true that the closure of any @xmath5-orbit in @xmath6 ( or even the orbit itself ) contains a well - rounded lattice ?",
    "we answer these questions affirmatively for _ closed _ orbits in  [ sec : closed orbits ] . to this end",
    "we use results of tomanov and the second - named author @xcite , as well as a covering result ( which we learned from michael levin ) generalizing one of the results of @xcite ; this topological result appears to be well - known to experts , but in order to keep this paper self - contained , we give the proof in the appendix .",
