    "hawking discovered that the black hole radiation possesses an exactly thermal spectrum of temperature depending on the surface gravity of the black hole  @xcite . particularly , the radiation does not depend on the details of the structure of the object that collapsed to form the black hole .",
    "thus , an initially pure quantum state will evolve into a mixed thermal state as the black hole radiates .",
    "this phenomenon , known as the paradox of black hole information loss , obviously violates the quantum unitarity for the closed system .    since its appearing",
    ", many attempts  @xcite have been made to resolve this paradox . in the previous investigations ,",
    "the radiation is always treated as possessing the thermal spectrum and the space - time geometry is fixed .",
    "recently , based on the wkb approximation , the tunneling probability for the hawking radiation was derived in the framework of dynamical geometry .",
    "it turns out surprisingly that the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal  @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "it is found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the successively radiated two particles are correlated , and thus no information is lost in the radiation  @xcite . actually , by using the same approach as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hawking radiation spectra of various black holes have been obtained  @xcite .",
    "these results verify the correlation between the successive radiations and the conservation of the information in the radiation  @xcite .",
    "we find that the chain rule for the probability is essential for the information conservation in the black hole radiation , and we verify case by case that the chain rule indeed holds for various hawking radiations coincidentally .",
    "we observe that the above mentioned coincidence can be exactly explained by the no - hair theorem of black hole together with the law of energy conservation .",
    "in fact , from our  one hair \" postulate based on the no - hair theorem and the law of energy conservation , we are able to derive a general form of the tunneling probability of hawking radiation without resorting to the details of the black hole , such as its geometric structure .",
    "we are thus able to prove that for the tunneling probability obtained from the wkb approximation , the chain rule is satisfied automatically and the above mentioned coincidence is of physical necessity",
    ". it should be clear that our results demonstrate the advantage of treating the black hole radiation as a tunneling process .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] , our postulate is stated based on the no - hair theorem . in sec .  [ sec : iii ] , a general formula for the tunneling probability is derived from the postulate . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] , the tunneling rate for the schwarzschild black hole is obtained without referring to its geometry . in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] , the case by case verification of our postulate is given for various black hole radiations .",
    "it is well known that all black hole solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations of gravitation and electromagnetism in general relativity can be completely characterized by only three externally observable classical parameters : mass , electric charge , and angular momentum .",
    "this result is referred to as no - hair theorem of steady black hole . for our purpose",
    ", we generalize this theorem for the dynamic black hole as follows : the tunneling probability for the hawking radiation only depends on the final state of the steady black hole and the total energy @xmath0 after simultaneously radiating n particles with the energies @xmath1 . here",
    ", there is only one hair \" quantity @xmath2 and the tunneling probability has nothing to do with its partition .    to investigate the above  one - hair \" postulate ,",
    "let us consider the two processes in the hawking radiation , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiation ] :    * the black hole radiates a single particle with the energy @xmath3 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiation](a ) .",
    "the mass of the black hole reduces to @xmath4 .",
    "the tunneling probability is defined as @xmath5 .",
    "the black hole can also simultaneously radiate two particles with the energies @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the probability of this process is denoted by @xmath8 based on the no - hair theorem of black hole and the law of energy conservation , we postulate the one - hair theorem for black hole radiation : if @xmath9then @xmath10",
    "+ actually , we can imagine that after the hawking radiation the radiated particle immediately splits into two particles with the energy @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , and in the split no particular energy partition between the two particles is preferred .",
    "the one - hair theorem simply means that all the splits satisfying the law of energy conservation possess the same tunneling probability .",
    "* the black hole firstly radiates a particle with the energy @xmath6 and then radiates another particle with the energy @xmath13 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiation](b ) .",
    "the mass of the black hole also reduces to @xmath4 .",
    "the tunneling probability for this process is @xmath14 where the conditional probability @xmath15 reflects the fact that the the mass of the black hole reduces to @xmath16 after it radiats the particle of energy @xmath17 .",
    "+ we remark here that , the first radiated particle is correlated to the second one , since the conditional tunneling probability of the second one actually depends on the energy @xmath6 of the first one .",
    "most recently , this correlation is employed to account for the information loss in the black hole radiation process  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we only consider the steady state of the black hole .",
    "it will take a longer time to reach the steady state than the relaxation time of each radiation . in this case , the one - hair theorem for black hole radiation can be re - expressed as @xmath18 or @xmath19here , as only the steady solutions of the black hole radiation are concerned , we have identified the two processes of simultaneously and successively radiating two particles . for the multi - particle case , we can recover the chain rule as @xmath20 based on this two - particle case .",
    "thus , to verify the chain rule for various hawking radiation , we need only to prove the postulation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : postualte ] ) .    to justify the above observation ,",
    "let us briefly review some results derived from the dynamic calculation based on the generalized wkb approximation . in reference",
    "@xcite , the tunneling probability for a particle out of the black hole is defined as @xmath21where @xmath22 is the action for an @xmath23-wave outgoing positive particle .",
    "the exact form of the imaginary part of the action reads@xmath24here , the hamiltonian @xmath25 is defined through the radial null geodesics equation , and particularly @xmath26 for the schwarzschild black hole . it is easily seen that @xmath27 naturally satisfies the above stated postulate .",
    "then it can be concluded that the conservation of information will not be broken if hawking radiation is treated as tunneling process , as has been proved in many references  @xcite .    .",
    "( b ) the black hole radiates firstly a particle with energy @xmath28 and successively another particle with energy @xmath29.,width=340 ]",
    "in this section , we will present a derivation of the general form of the tunneling probability based only on the `` one hair '' postulate . without losing the generality , we assume @xmath30 , \\]]where @xmath31 is actually the tunneling entropy for the black hole radiation .",
    "it then follows from equation eq .",
    "[ eq : postualte ] that @xmath32substituting the taylor expansion form @xmath33 of the function @xmath34 into this equation and comparing the coefficients of the terms with the same orders of @xmath35 , we obtain the following system of recursive equations @xmath36differentiating the left hand right hand sides of the above equations with respect to @xmath6 then results in the equation @xmath37 for each @xmath38 . thus we have the recursion formula @xmath39and the black hole entropy can be rewritten as @xmath40define the entropy @xmath41 for the black hole radiation through @xmath42the black hole entropy then reads @xmath43this is the main result of this paper .",
    "obviously , @xmath44 in eq .",
    "(  [ eq : gform ] ) is a conservation quantity . according to the above result ,",
    "after a black hole of mass @xmath45 radiates a tunneling particle with energy @xmath46 , its entropy decrease is @xmath47    in deriving the above result , it is tacitly assumed that the black hole does not carry charge . for charged black hole a similar result",
    "can easily be obtained by the above method .",
    "in fact , when a charged black hole with charge @xmath48 radiates a particle with charge @xmath49 , the tunneling probability can be derived as @xmath50",
    "in this section , we will derive the tunneling probability for the hawking radiation of the schwarzschild black hole without referring to its dynamic geometry .",
    "we assume that the entropy for black hole radiation is corrected to the second order of the tunneling energy @xmath46 , namely @xmath51where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are mass - dependent functions to be determined",
    ". then equation (  [ eq : entrop ] ) takes the form @xmath54gives the following equations about @xmath52 and",
    "@xmath55 @xmath56it then follows that @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the entropy of black hole radiation is obtained as @xmath59where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are constants .",
    "if we take @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then we recover the well - known result by parikh and wilczek : @xmath64 .",
    "\\label{spec}\\]]we would like to emphasize again that , in obtaining the above result , we only make the assumption that the entropy of the black hole is a polynomial of the radiated energy @xmath46 , and the details of the dynamic geometry do not come into the derivation .",
    "if the entropy is a polynomial of @xmath46 of degree @xmath65 , then we have @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant independent of the mass @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the conventional thermal spectrum @xmath68 does not satisfy eq .",
    "(  [ eq : entrop ] ) about the conditional probability . in that case",
    ", @xmath69 is the usual entropy for the schwarzschild black hole , and is usually called bekenstein - hawking entropy of black hole .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the above spectrum function (  [ spec ] ) indicates that the two successively radiated particles are actually correlated . since hawking radiation",
    "can carry information through this correlation between the radiated particles , the conservation of total information can be restored by taking this correlation into account .",
    "in this section , we will check the radiation spectra of some well known black holes to see if they satisfy the one - hair postulate expressed by eq .",

    "in this letter , we suggest the one - hair postulate to describe hawking radiation as tunneling process based on the no - hair theorem and the energy conservation law .",
