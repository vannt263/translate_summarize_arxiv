    "in many nonlinear continuous systems dissipative structures branch out of a homogeneous basic state when the external stress exceeds a critical threshold .",
    "examples for these transitions are taylor - couette flow , rayleigh - bnard convection , binary - fluid convection , flame - front propagation , and some chemical or biological processes @xcite .",
    "often , for a fixed configuration of parameters and boundary conditions a continuous or discrete family of patterns with different wave numbers is stable .",
    "their stability regime , e.  g. , a band of wave numbers might be limited by the possibility of resonant triad interactions of modes like those described by the eckhaus or benjamin - feir mechanism @xcite .",
    "the stable structures within such a band can be generated by appropriately engineered time histories of the parameters and/or by properly changing the boundary conditions , e.  g. , the system size .",
    "the most intensively investigated examples in this respect are the structures of taylor vortices @xcite in an annulus between concentric cylinders of which the inner one rotates and convective roll patterns in horizontal layers of one - component fluids @xcite or binary mixtures heated from below @xcite .",
    "this multiplicity of solutions of the underlying nonlinear partial differential equations that stably coexist for a fixed configuration of parameters and boundary conditions seems to disappear in an open - flow system : recent numerical simulations of rayleigh - bnard convective rolls traveling downstream in an imposed horizontal poiseuille flow showed @xcite that their structure is uniquely selected ",
    "i.  e. it is independent of parameter history , initial conditions , and system size  in the absolutely unstable regime .",
    "this is the parameter regime of an open - flow system in which the secondary pattern starting , e.  g. , from a spatially localized perturbation can grow in upstream as well as in downstream direction @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in the convectively unstable regime @xcite initial perturbations are blown out of the system  both , the upstream as well as the downstream facing front of the growing structure move downstream . in the absolutely unstable regime",
    "the structure expansion proceeds until the upstream ( downstream ) moving front encounters in a finite system the inlet ( outlet ) and adjusts to the inlet ( outlet ) boundary condition .",
    "the final pattern resulting in such a situation shows a characteristic streamwise profile of the amplitude growing with increasing distance from the inlet and of the wave number variation , and a characteristic global oscillation frequency associated with the downstream motion of the pattern .    in this work",
    "we elucidate in numerical and analytical detail how such a uniquely selected spatiotemporal pattern structure can be understood as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with the oscillation frequency being the eigenvalue and the profiles of pattern intensity and wave number determining the corresponding eigenfunction .",
    "we also show how this pattern selection process is related to the one occurring behind a front or `` domain wall '' that spatially separates an unstable , homogeneous state from a stable , structured state . to that end",
    "we present results of extensive numerical and analytical investigations of vortex patterns in the annulus of the taylor - couette setup with an externally imposed axial through - flow . for small through - flow rates and small rotation rates of the inner cylinder the structure of propagating vortex  ( pv ) flow with vortices being advected in downstream direction is rotationally symmetric . only for higher through - flow rates , which are not investigated here , there is a bifurcation @xcite to spirals @xcite .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of the full , rotationally symmetric , two dimensional  ( 2d )  navier - stokes equations  ( nse ) .",
    "they are compared with our numerical and analytical results obtained from the appropriate @xcite 1d  ginzburg - landau amplitude equation  ( gle ) approximation to the problem of pv  flow and with experimental results @xcite    the eigenvalue problem of the pattern selection by the imposed flow can best be analyzed and explained within the gle  framework . therein , the complex amplitude @xmath0 of the pv  flow depends in the absolutely unstable regime on the streamwise position @xmath1 and on time @xmath2 in a multiplicative way only , @xmath3 after transients have died out .",
    "the @xmath1-independent frequency @xmath4 and the complex , @xmath1-dependent amplitude @xmath5 that describes the streamwise variation of pattern modulus and wave number are simultaneously fixed via a solvability condition in the form of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem .",
    "the selection of @xmath4 and @xmath5 seems to result from requiring the spatial variation of the amplitude to be as small as possible under the imposed boundary conditions for @xmath6 at the ends of the annulus .",
    "approaching the border between the absolutely and convectively unstable regimes the pattern selection mechanism becomes linear : for driving and through - flow rates on this border line the selected frequency is the one resulting from a linear front whose spatiotemporal behavior is governed by the fastest growing linear mode .",
    "the latter is identified by a particular saddle of the complex linear dispersion relation over the complex wave number plane @xcite .",
    "now , the linear dispersion relations of nse @xcite and gle differ for supercritical control parameters . and",
    "therefore the pv  structures selected by nse or gle differ in a characteristic way .",
    "it should be emphasized that the structural dynamics of pattern formation in the convectively unstable regime at larger through - flow rates and/or smaller driving rates substantially differs from the one investigated here in the absolutely unstable regime .",
    "the latter regime is governed by nonlinear contributions in the balance equations ; the resulting patterns are uniquely selected and insensitive to initial conditions , parameter history , and small perturbations . on the other hand ,",
    "in the convectively unstable regime that has attracted more experimental activities lately @xcite the growing patterns are sensitive to initial conditions and perturbations .",
    "thus , e.  g. , the noise sustained patterns @xcite occurring in this regime depend on details of the spatiotemporal properties of the perturbation source .",
    "the taylor - couette system @xcite with an imposed axial through - flow has been investigated as a well defined open - flow system theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite since the beginning 1930s .",
    "linear stability analyses of the basic state to traveling axisymmetric vortices were performed using various approximations , e.  g.  , for the narrow - gap limit , or simplified azimuthal velocity , or axial through - flow profiles @xcite , and later on for various aspect ratios fixed by the diameters of both cylinders @xcite . also , many experiments and comparisons with the theoretical predictions were done @xcite .",

    "<S> a unique pattern selection in the absolutely unstable regime of a driven , nonlinear , open - flow system is analyzed : the spatiotemporal structures of rotationally symmetric vortices that propagate downstream in the annulus of the rotating taylor - couette system due to an externally imposed axial through - flow are investigated for two different axial boundary conditions at the in- and outlet . </S>",
    "<S> detailed quantitative results for the oscillation frequency , the axial profile of the wave number , and the temporal fourier amplitudes of the propagating vortex patterns obtained by numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equations are compared with results of the appropriate ginzburg - landau amplitude equation approximation and also with experiments . unlike the stationary patterns in systems without through - flow the spatiotemporal structures of propagating vortices are independent of parameter history , initial conditions , and system s length . </S>",
    "<S> they do , however , depend on the axial boundary conditions in addition to the driving rate of the inner cylinder and the through - flow rate . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the amplitude equation shows that the pattern selection can be described by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with the frequency being the eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> the complex amplitude being the corresponding eigenfunction describes the axial structure of intensity and wave number . </S>",
    "<S> small , but characteristic differences in the structural dynamics between the navier - stokes equations and the amplitude equation are mainly due to the different dispersion relations . approaching the border between absolute and convective instability the eigenvalue problem becomes effectively linear and the selection mechanism approaches that one of linear front propagation . </S>"
