    "long time ago , the relevance of multiple hard partonic collisions taking place within a single hadronic scattering , the so called multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) , has been addressed and studied  @xcite .",
    "although mpi are higher twist , i.e.  they are suppressed by a power of @xmath0 with respect to single parton interactions , being @xmath1 the partonic center - of - mass energy in the collision , experimental evidence of these kind of processes has been obtained , already some years ago @xcite .",
    "mpi are of great relevance for lhc physics , where they represent a background for the search of new physics .",
    "it is not surprising therefore that a strong debate around mpi has been arising in recent years , when several dedicated workshops have been organized , starting from that illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we concentrate on double parton scattering ( dps ) processes .",
    "it is now understood that dps contributes , e.g. , to same - sign @xmath2 and same - sign dilepton production  @xcite and represents a background for higgs studies in the channel @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "evidence of the occurrence of dps at lhc has been already established  @xcite .",
    "two comprehensive papers reporting the status of the art theoretical knowledge of these processes have recently appeared @xcite .",
    "new signatures of dps producing double drell - yan processes have been studied recently  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical origin of double parton correlations , having potential effects in dps , in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering and in hard exclusive processes , has been the subject of recent comprehensive studies @xcite .    in the original work",
    "@xcite , the dps cross section was written in terms of double parton distribution functions ( dpdf ) @xmath4 , describing the joint probability of having two partons with flavors @xmath5 , longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath6 and transverse separation @xmath7 inside a hadron : @xmath8 the partonic cross sections @xmath9 represent the hard , short - distance processes , while @xmath10 is a symmetry factor arising if identical particles are present in the final state . in eq .",
    ", contributions due to diparton flavor , spin and color correlations are neglected , as well as parton - exchange interference contributions  @xcite .",
    "these correlations are present in qcd and could be phenomenologically relevant .",
    "two main assumptions are usually made in dps analyses : + i ) the dependence on the transverse separation and on the momentum fractions or parton flavors are not correlated : @xmath11 ii ) a factorized form is chosen also for the @xmath6 dependence : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the usual parton distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "@xmath14 introduces the kinematic constraint @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is a parameter to be fixed phenomenologically .",
    "dpdfs , describing soft physics , are nonperturbative functions .",
    "positivity bounds on dpdfs have been recently derived @xcite .",
    "dpdfs can not be evaluated in qcd but , as it happens for the usual pdfs , they can be at least estimated at a low scale , @xmath17 , the so called hadronic scale , using quark models .",
    "the evolution of dpdfs , namely the way they change from a given momentum scale @xmath18 to a given momentum scale @xmath19 is being a matter of debate  @xcite .",
    "the resolution of this debate will be instrumental to relate not only data from different experiments but also model calculations at the hadronic scale to lhc data . in this way , the analysis of data involving dps can be guided .",
    "a first important calculation of this kind is the one recently presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a bag model framework for the proton  @xcite has been considered to evaluate dpdfs in the valence region . as in any model where the valence quarks carry all the momentum , in the bag model the initial scale @xmath20 has to be taken quite low .",
    "if the bag were assumed to be rigid , as in important early calculations , corresponding to the so - called cavity approximation  @xcite , the quarks would be independent and none of the relevant correlations described by dpdfs would be found . in ref .",
    "@xcite , therefore , a prescription to recover momentum conservation , leading to quark correlations in the bag , already applied in model calculations of parton distributions , has been used  @xcite . the main outcome of ref .",
    "@xcite is that , in the modified mit bag model , the approximation eq .",
    "holds reasonably well , but eq .   is strongly violated .",
    "problems with eq .   had already been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite is retaken here in a constituent quark model ( cqm ) framework .",
    "cqm calculations of parton distributions have been proven to be able to predict the gross features of pdfs @xcite , generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) @xcite .",
    "similar expectations motivated the present analysis . with respect to the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the non relativistic ( nr ) dynamics used here includes from the very beginning correlations into the scheme , so that , for example , the dynamical origin of the breaking of the approximation eq .",
    "is clarified .",
    "as it will be seen , this analysis helps to understand which , among the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , are model dependent .",
    "it is important to stress from the very beginning that this kind of analysis , as the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , is valid at the low hadronic scale corresponding to the model and only in the valence quark region . for this study to be directly used in the lhc data analysis , having for the moment high statistics only for very small values of @xmath21 ,",
    "far therefore from the valence region , and corresponding to high momentum transfer , additional studies , in particular the introduction of the qcd evolution of the model results , are necessary .",
    "this investigation , like the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , is therefore a first exploratory estimate , thought to understand the dynamical origin of the different momentum correlations and to guide experimental measurements accordingly .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    ", the formalism to evaluate the dpdfs in a cqm is clarified and the main equations presented . in the third one ,",
    "results are illustrated and discussed .",
    "eventually , conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "as already stated in the introduction , we are going to use a cqm framework and therefore only correlations for two valence quarks of flavor @xmath22 can be studied .",
    "let us work in momentum space , in terms of the fourier - transformed distribution @xmath23 , defined as follows : @xmath24 the formalism introduced in ref .",

    "the color - summed dpdf for two quarks @xmath22 with polarization @xmath25 in the proton , is : @xmath26 where light cone components , given by @xmath27 for a generic 4-vector @xmath28 have been used for the quark and proton momenta and the two quark , spin dependent , off diagonal momentum distribution @xmath29 has been introduced , using momentum space wave functions . in eq .",

    "the factor 3 in eq .",
    "( [ manybody ] ) represents the number of valence quark pairs in the proton .",
    "it arises from the fact that any pair is equivalent to each other , since the proton ground state wave function is symmetric , once the color degrees of freedom are factorized out .    by taking into account properly the corresponding flavor and spin projectors , any kind of spin and flavor correlations can be easily evaluated . for the sake of definiteness , in this paper we will concentrate on spin averaged dpdfs , which we call , for brevity , distributions @xmath32 . in a cqm framework , using translational invariance , they have therefore , according to eqs .",
    "( [ uno ] ) and ( [ manybody ] ) , the following form : @xmath33 where the intrinsic wave function @xmath34 has been introduced and @xmath35 .",
    "a similar expression was presented already in ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained as the nr limit of the general definition of the dpdfs , given in terms of light - cone quantized operators and states .",
    "this equation allows one to evaluate @xmath32 in any cqm , by using the corresponding intrinsic momentum space wave functions .    in our presentation , we will use two different cqm :    @xmath36 a simple harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential model , assuming an su(6 ) spin - flavor structure , with the proton representing the ground state . in this case , the intrinsic wave function",
    "can be written : @xmath37 where the spectroscopic notation @xmath38 , with @xmath39 being the symmetry type , has been used and @xmath40 is the usual su(6 ) spin - flavor proton wave function ( @xmath41 refers to spin , @xmath42 to flavor ) : @xmath43 whose explicit expression is given in textbooks and not repeated here .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 of the ho potential is fixed to the value 1.35 @xmath45 , in order to reproduce the slope of the proton charge form factor at zero momentum transfer . despite of its simplicity , it is perfectly clear that in this model dynamical correlations between the quarks are present from the very beginning , due to the @xmath46 term in the wave function , preventing it from being a simple product of two ho ground state wave functions .",
    "it is remarkable that this does not happen in the mit bag model , whose simplest realization describes just independent , uncorrelated particles . in ref .",
    "@xcite , correlations are introduced by properly modifying the simplest bag model scenario . in a potential model",
    ", we have them even in the simplest case .",
    "we think therefore it is very appropriate to study double parton correlations in this framework .    @xmath47 the cqm of isgur and karl ( ik ) @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the proton wave function is obtained by adding a one gluon exchange contribution to a confining ho potential , along the line addressed already in ref .",

    "6 , where the ratio @xmath102 is shown .",
    "the ratio we obtain is actually rather flat for @xmath103 , while some structures are seen in the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in closing this section ,",
    "an important caveat is in order .",
    "we reiterate that the present estimate of quark correlations , as the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , showing important violations of the often assumed approximations eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zfact ] ) and ( [ eq : xfact ] ) , is expected to be reliable only in the valence quark region , i.e. for @xmath104 , and at the low energy scale described by the cqm .",
    "actual data from lhc are dominated by the very low @xmath21 region ( @xmath105 ) , at a very high scale of momentum transfer .",
    "any comparison of this kind of results with data is instructive only once perturbative qcd effects are implemented by using qcd evolution to the experimental scale .",
    "certainly , due to the coupling of quarks and gluons , correlations will be generated even if exact factorization is assumed at the low energy scale of the model .",
    "in many phenomenological applications , relevant , e.g. , for the lhc experimental program , parton correlations are neglected in modelling double parton distribution functions .",
    "the latter quantities are therefore factorized in two terms , one depending on the longitudinal momentum fractions of the two quarks , @xmath93 and @xmath92 , and another on the transverse momentum separation , @xmath87 , e.g. a sort of @xmath106 factorization is assumed .",
    "in addition to that , also an @xmath107 factorization assumption is usually made , e.g. , the distribution on the longitudinal momenta @xmath108 is taken to be uncorrelated .",
    "this study aims at establishing to what extent constituent quark models support the two types of factorization , comparing the results with those of an important previous analysis , performed in a properly modified version of the simplest bag model . in this way",
    ", model - dependent features can be distinguished from model - independent ones .",
    "an analysis of double quark correlations has been therefore performed in the valence quark region , for spin averaged double parton distribution functions .",
    "two different constituent quark models have been used , i.e. , a simple non relativistic su(6 ) symmetric model and its generalization , the model of isgur and karl , corresponding to a mild su(6 ) breaking due to the exchange of one gluon . for the aim of studying correlations and of understanding their dynamical origin",
    ", the framework used here , correlated from the very beginning through the interquark potential , is to be preferred with respect to models where correlations are added through prescriptions modifying independent particle models , such as the simplest version of mit bag model .",
    "the conclusions of our work are as follows . in both constituent quark models ,",
    "the @xmath107 factorization is strongly violated , confirming a similar conclusion obtained already in the bag model framework .",
    "this feature seems therefore a model - independent one . in the su(6 ) symmetric model , where the proton is described by a pure symmetric @xmath109 wave , exact @xmath110 factorization is obtained .",
    "this features is mildly spoiled in the isgur and karl model , as it happens in the bag model framework . with respect to the latter",
    ", the present approach allows to understand more clearly the dynamical origin of the breaking of the @xmath111 factorization , and its relation to the orbital angular momentum of the quarks .",
    "it is also found that the amount of violation of the @xmath111 factorization is a model dependent feature .",
    "certainly this effect is a small one in the scenario discussed here , where the symmetric @xmath109 wave is dominating . models with more sizable contributions from components of the wave function with higher values of the orbital angular momentum would certainly show a stronger violation . in closing , it is important to stress that , for the results of model calculations of double parton distributions , obtained either in a bag model or in a constituent quark one , to be phenomenologically relevant to the lhc physics programme , the evaluation of their qcd evolution is crucial",
    ". this will be the subject of further studies , together with the evaluation of the same observables using relativistic , light - front approaches . in this framework , successfully applied in hadronic physics in general ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and for the calculation of pdfs in particular ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , important contributions from high values of the relative orbital angular momentum naturally arise .",

    "<S> double parton correlations , having effects on the double parton scattering processes occurring in high - energy hadron - hadron collisions , for example at the lhc , are studied in the valence quark region , within constituent quark models . in this framework , </S>",
    "<S> two particle correlations are present without any additional prescription , at variance with what happens , for example , in independent particle models , such as the mit bag model in its simplest version . from the present analysis , conclusions similar to the ones obtained recently in a modified version of the bag model </S>",
    "<S> can be drawn : correlations in the longitudinal momenta of the active quarks are found to be sizable , while those in transverse momentum are much smaller . </S>",
    "<S> however , the used framework allows to understand clearly the dynamical origin of the correlations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is shown that the small size of the correlations in transverse momentum is a model dependent result , which would not occur if models with sizable quark orbital angular momentum were used to describe the proton . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis permits therefore to clarify the dynamical origin of the double parton correlations and to establish which , among the features of the results , are model independent . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to test experimentally the studied effects is discussed . </S>"
