    "emission lines from be - like ions have provided useful electron density and temperature diagnostics for a variety of astrophysical plasmas .",
    "many ions in this series , such as c  iii , n  iv , ti  xix and fe  xxiii , are also important for the study of fusion plasmas . for n",
    "iv @xcite have measured the 2s@xmath3 @xmath4s@xmath52s2p @xmath4p@xmath6 line at 76.5 nm in the swarthmore spheromak experiment to diagnose the plasma impurities .",
    "similarly , @xcite have measured three impurity lines of n  iv ( @xmath7 765 , 923 and 1719 @xmath8 ) in the nova - unicamp tokamak plasma . however , for plasma modelling accurate atomic data are required , particularly for energy levels , radiative rates ( a - values ) , and excitation rates or equivalently the effective collision strengths ( @xmath0 ) , which are obtained from the electron impact collision strengths ( @xmath9 ) . given that , we have already reported such data for a number of be - like ions , namely c  iii , al  x , cl  xiv , k  xvi , ti  xix and ge  xxix ",
    "see @xcite and references therein . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on n  iv .",
    "several emission lines of n  iv have been observed in the sun @xcite .",
    "in addition , forbidden lines , mostly belonging to the 2s@xmath3 @xmath4s  2s2p @xmath10p@xmath11 multiplet ( @xmath7@xmath7 1483,1486 @xmath8 ) , have been observed in the ultraviolet spectra of low - density astrophysical plasmas , such as planetary nebulae and symbiotic stars ",
    "see for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these doublet lines are also detected in ly@xmath12 emitting galaxies ( @xcite and @xcite ) and in low - mass and low - luminosity galaxies @xcite .",
    "an early analysis of solar emission lines of n  iv was undertaken by @xcite . in the absence of direct calculations of collisional data , they interpolated @xmath0 from the existing results for c  iii and o  v. subsequently , @xcite calculated such data adopting the r - matrix code .",
    "these calculations are in @xmath13 coupling ( russell - saunders or spin - orbit coupling ) and include the 12 states of the 2s@xmath3 , 2s2p , 2p@xmath3 and 2s3@xmath14 configurations .",
    "subsequent results for fine - structure transitions were obtained through an algebraic re - coupling scheme , and stored in an earlier version of the chianti database at http://www.chiantidatabase.org/.    recently , @xcite have performed much larger calculations for a series of be - like ions , including n  iv . they have considered 238 fine - structure levels , belonging to the @xmath15 7 configurations . for the generation of wave functions ,",
    "i.e. to determine energy levels and a - values , they adopted the _ autostructure _ ( as ) code of @xcite and for the subsequent calculations of @xmath9 and @xmath0 , the r - matrix code of @xcite .",
    "however , they also primarily obtained @xmath9 in @xmath13 coupling , and the corresponding results for fine - structure transitions were determined through their intermediate coupling frame transformation ( icft ) method , similar to the one adopted by @xcite .",
    "the as code does not include higher - order relativistic effects , which are important for heavier systems ( such as ge  xxix ) , but not for a comparatively light ion , such as n  iv .",
    "therefore , their calculations should represent a significant extension and improvement over the earlier results of @xcite .",
    "however , our work on a number of be - like ions ( al  x , cl  xiv , k  xvi , ti  xix and ge  xxix ) indicated that the data of @xcite were highly overestimated for a significant number of transitions , and over a wide range of electron temperatures @xcite .",
    "these be - like ions are comparatively highly ionised , but similar discrepancies have also been noted for transitions in c  iii @xcite as well as for al - like fe xiv @xcite , and most recently for ar - like fe ix @xcite .",
    "no two independent atomic data calculations are ever exactly the same , but there are two major differences between our work and that of @xcite , namely the methodology and the size . for the scattering calculations we have adopted the fully relativistic dirac atomic r - matrix code ( darc ) , in comparison to their semi - relativistic r - matrix method through the icft approach . however , in principle both approaches should provide comparable results for a majority of transitions and over a wide range of temperature , as has already been observed in several cases  see for example the work of @xcite on fe  iii and references therein . therefore , the discrepancies noted in the values of @xmath0 for a range of be - like ions are perhaps not due to the methodologies but their implementation , as already discussed in detail by us @xcite . since such large discrepancies are worrying and need to be addressed so that data can be confidently applied to plasma modelling , @xcite made an extensive analysis of these discrepancies taking al  x as an example .",
    "they rather concluded that the differences in the calculations of @xmath0 lie in the corresponding differences in the determination of _ atomic structure _ , and not in the implementation of the scattering methods as we suggested .",
    "since they could perform much larger calculations than us ( and indeed others such as @xcite ) , they not only defended their work but also concluded their results to be more accurate .",
    "in general , it is undoubtedly true that a larger calculation should be superior ( i.e. comparatively more accurate ) , because of the inclusion of resonances arising from the higher - lying levels of the additional configurations .",
    "however , these should not increase values of @xmath0 by orders of magnitude , and not for a significant number of transitions and over an entire range of temperatures . unfortunately , until now it was not possible for us to match the size of the @xcite calculations , because of the limitations of the computational resources available to us . however , one of our colleagues ( dr .",
    "connor ballance ) has now implemented the parallelised version of the darc code and therefore we are able to perform as large a calculation as @xcite .",
    "we do this for an important be - like ion , i.e. n  iv , to make direct comparisons with their work .    [",
    "cols=\">,<,<,>,>,>,>,>,>,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     since we want to resolve discrepancies between our calculations of @xmath0 and those by @xcite , we have performed two full calculations , i.e. darc1 and darc2 .",
    "our darc1 calculations are similar to those for c  iii @xcite , i.e. the energy resolution ( @xmath16e ) is generally 0.001  ryd , although in a few small energy ranges it is 0.002  ryd .",
    "resonances have been resolved at a total of 3622 energies in the thresholds region . by comparison ,",
    "our darc2 calculations are much more extensive because over most of the energy range @xmath16e is as small as 0.000  045  ryd .",
    "thus the darc2 calculations have been performed at over 52  000 energies .",
    "clearly , our darc1 calculations are ( comparatively much ) coarser , but have still taken several months to compute . similarly , the darc2 calculations have also taken several months in spite of using a parallelised version of the code for this work , as this calculation is much larger , in both the size of the h matrix as well as the energy resolution .    before we discuss our results of @xmath0 , in fig .",
    "2 ( a , b and c ) we show resonances ( from the darc2 calculations ) for three transitions , namely 2s@xmath3 @xmath4s@xmath52s2p @xmath10p@xmath6 ( 13 ) , 2s@xmath3 @xmath4s@xmath52p@xmath3 @xmath4s@xmath5 ( 110 ) and 2s2p @xmath10p@xmath62s2p @xmath4p@xmath17 ( 35 ) .",
    "the first is an inter - combination transition whereas the other two are forbidden .",
    "similar dense resonances have been detected for many more transitions .",
    "our calculated values of @xmath0 ( darc2 ) are listed in table  8 over a wide temperature range up to 2@xmath110@xmath18 k , suitable for application to a wide range of astrophysical ( and laboratory ) plasmas .",
    "data at any intermediate temperature can be easily interpolated , because ( unlike @xmath9 ) @xmath0 is a slowly varying function of t@xmath19 .",
    "our corresponding results from darc1 are not listed here but can be obtained from the first author ( kma ) on request . as noted in section  1 , the most recent and extensive corresponding data available for @xmath0 are those by @xcite . similar to our work , they have adopted the ( semi - relativistic ) r - matrix code , resolved resonances in a fine energy mesh ( @xmath200.000  09  ryd ) , averaged @xmath9 over a maxwellian distribution of electron velocities , and reported results for ( fine - structure ) transitions among 238 levels , over a wide range of electron temperature up to 3.2@xmath110@xmath21 k. however , they divided their calculations into two parts . for @xmath22 11.5",
    "they performed electron _",
    "exchange _ calculations but neglected this for higher @xmath23 values .",
    "this should not affect the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "however , for higher @xmath23 their @xmath16e was coarser ( 0.009  ryd ) , which sometimes may be a limiting source of error in calculating @xmath0 .",
    "by contrast , our calculations have the same energy resolution for all partial waves .",
    "similarly , they calculated values of @xmath9 up to an energy of about 17  ryd , and beyond that dipole and born limits were used to extrapolate results up to infinite energy , whereas we have determined @xmath9 up to 35 and 45  ryd for darc1 and darc2 , sufficient to calculate @xmath0 in the temperature range of interest .",
    "this is ( perhaps ) a crucial difference between the two methodologies and hence a major source of discrepancy , as already noted in @xcite . to address the discrepancies in @xmath0",
    ", we now undertake detailed comparisons between different sets of results .",
    "we first compare our values of @xmath0 from darc1 and darc2 , to test the conclusion of @xcite that differences in atomic structure ( i.e. the size of a calculation ) can give rise to the large discrepancies noted by them .",
    "we confine this comparison to transitions among the lowest 78 levels , because all calculations have the same ordering for these , as seen in table  1 .",
    "we have made these comparisons at three temperatures of : te1=3.2@xmath110@xmath10 , te2=1.6@xmath110@xmath24 and te3=8.0@xmath110@xmath24  k. te1 is the lowest temperature at which @xcite have calculated their results and te2 is closer to the most appropriate value for astrophysical applications @xcite . at te1 , among the lowest 78 levels ( 3003 transitions ) , the @xmath0 from darc1 and darc2 differ by over 20% for 21% of the transitions . for most , @xmath25 are larger , generally within a factor of two , but for about 1% of the transitions the discrepancies are up to a factor of 10 .",
    "these differences are clearly understandable , mainly because ( i ) this is a very low temperature and hence sensitive to the position and magnitude of resonances , ( ii ) our @xmath16e in darc1 is coarse ( 0.001  ryd equivalent to 158  k ) and hence not suitable for calculations at such low temperatures , and ( iii ) our darc2 calculations include more resonances .",
    "a similar comparison at te2 shows discrepancies for only 8% of the transitions , mostly within a factor of two as shown in fig .",
    "3 . for about half of the transitions , @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 , and",
    "the reverse is true for the rest .",
    "in fact , all those transitions which show ( comparatively ) larger discrepancies ( less than a factor of 4 ) belong to levels higher than 70 , and this is clearly due to the inclusion of resonances from additional levels in darc2 .",
    "a similar conclusion applies at te3 , as for only 7% of the transitions are there differences of over 20% , and almost all agree within a factor of two .",
    "indeed , if the same fine(r ) energy resolution had been adopted in darc1 , then the differences between the two sets of @xmath0 might have been even less .",
    "therefore , our conclusion is clearly different ( see @xcite and particularly their fig .",
    "3 ) from those of @xcite .",
    "a larger calculation certainly improves the accuracy of the calculated @xmath0 , but for most transitions ( and particularly at temperatures of relevance ) the discrepancies are generally within @xmath2020% .",
    "we now compare our values of @xmath0 from darc2 with the icft results of @xcite .    in fig .",
    "4 ( a , b and c ) we show the ratio r = @xmath25/@xmath28 ( negative values plot @xmath28/@xmath25 and indicate @xmath28 @xmath29 ) for all transitions among the lowest 100 levels of n  iv at three temperatures of te1=3.2@xmath110@xmath10 , te2=1.6@xmath110@xmath24 and te3=1.6@xmath110@xmath2  k. the ratio r is shown as a function of transitions from _ lower _ levels i. at te1 , values of @xmath0 for about 22% of the 4950 transitions differ by over 20% , and for a majority of these the @xmath28 are larger ( by up to a factor of 6 ) . for transitions for which @xmath25 are larger",
    "the factor is generally below 3 , except for three  see fig .",
    "4a . considering the fine energy resolution in both calculations and the inclusion of the same number of levels ,",
    "such discrepancies are not expected . at te2 , a more relevant temperature for plasma modelling applications , the discrepancies are even worse because the @xmath28 are larger by up to a factor of 25 in most cases",
    " see fig .",
    "this comparison , although similar to the one shown and discussed earlier @xcite for other be - like ions , we believe , calls into question the reliability of the calculations by @xcite .",
    "te3 corresponds to @xmath2010  ryd , and therefore the contribution of resonances should not be as dominant as at lower temperatures ( note that the highest threshold considered is at 6.1  ryd  see table  1 ) .",
    "therefore , one would expect a ( comparatively ) better agreement between @xmath25 and @xmath28 .",
    "unfortunately , the discrepancies become even greater than at lower t@xmath19 , as shown in fig .",
    "4c , because @xmath28 are larger by up to a factor of 80 in some instances . to obtain a clearer view of the discrepancies we show these again in fig .",
    "4d , in which the negative vertical scale has been reduced to 30 .",
    "the @xmath0 of @xcite appear to be anomalous for many transitions and over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "we discuss these further below .",
    "@xcite have argued that instead of the lower levels i in fig . 4 , one should use the _ upper _ levels j to obtain a better comparison of the two calculations , because in a larger calculation the transitions among the lower levels should not be ( much ) affected  see their fig .",
    "5b . that should indeed be the case , although it does not apply in the present instance because both calculations are of the same size",
    "nevertheless , in fig . 5 ( a , b , c and d ) we show similar comparisons as those in fig .",
    "4 , but replacing i with j. only transitions among the lowest @xmath2050 levels show a reasonably satisfactory agreement , and discrepancies are very large for those belonging to higher levels .",
    "this is extremely unsatisfactory , considering that there are 188 levels above the lowest 50 .",
    "since both calculations have the same size of atomic structure and use the same r - matrix method a better agreement for transitions among a larger number of levels is expected .",
    "the comparisons of @xmath0 shown in figs .",
    "4 and 5 are only for transitions among the lowest 100 levels , as the aim is to provide a clear idea of the discrepancies .",
    "considering all 28  203 transitions among the 238 levels , about 41% , 38% and 44% of these differ by over 20% at te1 , te2 and te3 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , not only are the values of @xmath28 larger in a majority of cases , the discrepancies are also greater than shown in figs . 4 and 5 , namely up to four orders of magnitude .",
    "examples of such transitions are 59 ",
    "79/85/86 ( 2p3d  @xmath4p@xmath6 ",
    "2s6s  @xmath10s@xmath30 , 2s6d  @xmath10d@xmath30 , 2s6d  @xmath10d@xmath31 ) and there is no ambiguity in the ordering of these levels in our calculations and those of @xcite .",
    "all of these ( and many other ) are inter - combination transitions , but the a- values between the two sets of calculations agree within 20% .",
    "furthermore , the f - values for these are @xmath2010@xmath32 and therefore , such weak transitions should behave as forbidden .",
    "indeed this is the case in our calculations but not in those of @xcite .",
    "additionally , since one of the authors ( luis fernndez - menchero ) has kindly provided the @xmath9 data for these transitions , we can confirm that the differences in @xmath0 values are not due to resonances .",
    "nevertheless , their @xmath0 at te3 are 2.4@xmath110@xmath33 , 1.4@xmath110@xmath33 and 2.3@xmath110@xmath33 , respectively , compared to our results of 3.1@xmath110@xmath34 , 2.5@xmath110@xmath34 and 4.1@xmath110@xmath34 , respectively .",
    "similar discrepancies are found towards the lower end of the temperature range , and are partly due to different @xmath35 , but mostly due to incorrect trends .",
    "finally , we discuss just one more example . for the 30232/233/235 ( 2s4s  @xmath4s@xmath5 ",
    "2p7d @xmath10d@xmath36 , @xmath10p@xmath37 , @xmath10p@xmath38 ) transitions , the values of @xmath28 are larger than @xmath25 by about two orders of magnitude . these transitions are _ forbidden _ and resonances have ( practically ) zero contribution .",
    "therefore , both @xmath9 and @xmath0 should decrease with increasing energy / temperature .",
    "this is the case in our work , but not that of @xcite .",
    "between t@xmath19 = 3.2@xmath110@xmath10 and 1.6@xmath110@xmath2  k , the @xmath0 of @xcite increase from 1.08@xmath110@xmath34 , 8.38@xmath110@xmath39 , and 1.77@xmath110@xmath39 to 9.43@xmath110@xmath34 , 1.07@xmath110@xmath40 and 2.18@xmath110@xmath34 , respectively , whereas our results decrease from 5.24@xmath110@xmath39 , 5.83@xmath110@xmath39 , and 1.13@xmath110@xmath39 to 7.99@xmath110@xmath41 , 1.13@xmath110@xmath39 and 2.11@xmath110@xmath41 , respectively . unfortunately , for these transitions also neither the @xmath35 nor the trends in the icft calculations are correct . therefore , based on the comparisons shown here in figs . 4 and 5 , and the above discussion as well as those in @xcite",
    ", we confidently believe that the @xmath0 results listed by @xcite are indeed overestimated for a large number of transitions and over the entire range of temperatures .",
    "the reasons for this could be several as already stated @xcite .",
    "to recapitulate , these may be : ( i ) using two different ranges of partial waves with differing amount of @xmath16e in the thresholds region , ( ii ) extrapolation of @xmath9 over a very large energy range , and/or ( iii ) presence of some very large spurious resonances .",
    "in particular , we stress that the errors may be in the implementation of the icft , not the methodology itself .",
    "indeed this is ( in a way ) confirmed by the @xmath9 data provided by luis fernndez - menchero , because ( i ) is unlikely to be a major source of error and the authors of the icft calculations have checked for ( iii ) , which also does not apply particularly to the 30232/233/235 transitions .",
    "apart from the high energy behaviour of @xmath9 in the icft calculations , their approach ( of converting the @xmath13 results into @xmath42 ) unreasonably affects the background values of @xmath9 for some inter - combination transitions .",
    "in this work we have performed two sets of calculations for energy levels , radiative rates , collision strengths , and most importantly effective collision strengths ( equivalently electron impact excitation rates ) for transitions in be - like n  iv . in the first model , 166 levels of the @xmath15 5 configurations are considered , whereas the second one is larger with 238 levels , up to @xmath43 = 7 .",
    "this is mainly to assess the impact of a larger model over that of a smaller one on ( particularly ) the determination of @xmath0 and to make a direct comparison with the similar calculations of @xcite .    for the determination of energy levels and a - values ,",
    "the grasp code has been adopted , and ( the standard and parallelised versions of ) darc for the scattering calculations .",
    "these calculations are similar in methodology to our earlier work on other be - like ions @xcite , but much larger . for the lowest 10 levels , discrepancies in energies with measurements",
    "are up to 6% , but agreement is better than 1% for the remaining 228 . additionally , there are no significant discrepancies , in both magnitude or orderings , between our work and that of @xcite .",
    "the a - values for e1 , e2 , m1 and m2 transitions have also been reported .",
    "for most transitions there are no ( major ) discrepancies between the two models or with other available data , particularly for a majority of the strong e1 transitions .",
    "lifetimes calculated with these a - values are also found to be in good agreement with other available theoretical and experimental work , and hence ( to an extent ) confirm the accuracy of our calculations .",
    "based on several comparisons as well as the ratio of the velocity and length forms of the a - values , our listed results are probably accurate to better than 20% for a majority of the strong e1 transitions .",
    "data have also been reported for collision strengths over a wide range of energy , but only for resonance transitions . however , corresponding results for effective collision strengths are listed for all transitions among the 238 levels of n  iv and over a wide range of temperature up to 2.0@xmath110@xmath18 k , well in excess of what should be needed for modelling astrophysical and fusion plasmas . in our smaller model ( darc1 )",
    "the energy resolution for resonances in thresholds region is comparatively coarser ( 0.001  ryd ) , but is very fine in the larger one , i.e. 0.000  045  ryd .",
    "nevertheless , for most transitions among the lowest 78 levels , there are no major discrepancies between the two sets of @xmath0 .",
    "however , discrepancies with the corresponding results of @xcite are very large ( up to four orders of magnitude ) for over 40% of the transitions , and over the entire temperature range .",
    "these discrepancies are similar to those already found for other be - like ions @xcite , and do not support the conclusion of @xcite that these are due to the size of a calculation .",
    "our assessment is that for a majority of transitions , particularly among most of the lower levels , a larger calculation may improve the accuracy of @xmath0 , but the differences should not be very large .",
    "therefore , the discrepancies found for transitions in many be - like ions are not due to differences in the size of the atomic structure , but rather the implementation of the method for calculating data . based on several comparisons shown here and in previous papers",
    ", we confidently believe that for most transitions the @xmath0 data of @xcite for be - like ions are much overestimated . as this is perhaps most likely due to the implementation of icft , rather than the code itself , a re - examination of their calculations would therefore be helpful .",
    "this work has been carried out within the framework of the euro fusion consortium and has received funding from the euratom research and training programme 20142018 under grant agreement no 633053 and from the rcuk energy programme ( grant number ep / i501045 ) .",
    "the views and opinions expressed herein do not necessarily reflect those of the european commission .",
    "we are very thankful to our colleague dr .",
    "connor ballance for his help in generating data from the darc2 calculations .",
    "we also thank dr .",

    "<S> there have been discussions in the recent literature regarding the accuracy of the available electron impact excitation rates ( equivalently effective collision strengths @xmath0 ) for transitions in be - like ions . in the present paper we demonstrate , once again , that earlier results for @xmath0 are indeed overestimated ( by up to four orders of magnitude ) , for over 40% of transitions and over a wide range of temperatures . to do this we have performed two sets of calculations for n  iv , with two different model sizes consisting of 166 and 238 fine - structure energy levels . as in our previous work , for the determination of atomic structure the grasp ( general - purpose relativistic atomic structure package ) is adopted and for the scattering calculations ( the standard and parallelised versions of ) the dirac atomic r - matrix code ( darc ) are employed . </S>",
    "<S> calculations for collision strengths and effective collision strengths have been performed over a wide range of energy ( up to 45  ryd ) and temperature ( up to 2.0@xmath110@xmath2  k ) , useful for applications in a variety of plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding results for energy levels , lifetimes and a - values for all e1 , e2 , m1 and m2 transitions among 238 levels of n  iv are also reported .    </S>",
