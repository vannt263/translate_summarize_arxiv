    "vector mesons ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc . ) play a significant role in hadronic physics .",
    "their interactions , though not constrained by low - energy theorems , apparently follow the broad pattern of vector meson dominance ( vmd )  @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous efforts to incorporate vector mesons into field - theoretical frameworks .",
    "historically , the yang - mills theory was discovered in an early attempt to treat the @xmath2 meson  @xcite .",
    "more recently , interesting schemes based on `` hidden local symmetries '' ( hls ) were developed by bando _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in the original model  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath2 meson is the boson of a spontaneously broken gauge group .",
    "the model has been extended to two hidden gauge groups  @xcite ; then it also incorporates the lowest axial vector meson @xmath5 . with suitable parameters",
    ", these models can be quite successful phenomenologically , although they can not be systematically derived from qcd ( except in the limit of very light @xmath2 , if such a limit could be reached  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore theories with very large , and even infinite number @xmath0 of hidden local symmetries .",
    "our motivation is twofold .",
    "first and most straightforwardly , there are excited states in the vector and axial vector channels ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc .",
    "@xcite ) , which must become narrow resonances in the limit of large number of colors @xmath9 .",
    "it is tempting to treat them as gauge bosons of additional broken gauge groups . ,",
    "@xmath10 , etc . as a `` chain structure ''",
    "was made in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "the second motivation comes from recent theoretical developments .",
    "many strongly coupled gauge theories are found to have a dual description in terms of theories with gravity in higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the string theory dual to large-@xmath9 qcd must have strings propagating in five dimensions , in which the fifth dimension has the physical meaning of the energy scale  @xcite . in the framework of field theory ,",
    "the fifth dimension can be `` deconstructed '' in models with a large number of gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "we discovered that the continuum limit @xmath1 can lead to results that qualitatively , and in many cases even quantitatively , agree with phenomenology .",
    "most remarkably , the vector meson dominance , which in the hls theories required a tuning of parameters , becomes a natural consequence of the @xmath1 limit .",
    "another advantage of the limit @xmath1 is the possibility of matching to the asymptotic behavior of the current - current correlator known from perturbative qcd .",
    "as anticipated , a natural interpretation of this limit is a discretization , or deconstruction , of a 5-dimensional gauge theory .",
    "further , to our amusement , in the calculation of current - current correlators we found a relation very similar to the one employed in the ads / cft correspondence : the current - current correlator in 4d theory is expressed in terms of the variations of the classical 5d action with respect to the boundary values of the bulk gauge fields on the 4d boundaries .",
    "we limit our discussion to the isospin-1 sector of qcd .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the discussion to the isospin-0 sector ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 mesons ) .",
    "the detailed treatment of the @xmath14 problem , chiral anomaly , wess - zumino - witten term , and baryons is deferred to future work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the open moose model . in section  [ sec : observables ] we compute different physical observables : the vector meson mass spectrum , the decay constants of the pion and the vector mesons , the coupling between the vector mesons and the pions , and the pion electromagnetic form factor .",
    "we also check the validity of weinberg s spectral sum rules , and discover that the limit @xmath1 automatically leads to exact vmd for the pion formfactor .    in section  [ sec :",
    "continuum ] we take the limit of infinite number of the hidden groups @xmath1 .",
    "we show that the theory can be understood as a 5d yang - mills theory in an external metric and dilaton background .",
    "we establish an ads / cft - type prescription for calculating the current - current correlators .",
    "we consider two concrete realizations of the open moose in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "we find that a `` cosh '' background metric interpolating between two ads boundaries leads to correct asymptotic behavior of the current - current correlator .",
    "this allows us to establish a relationship between hadron parameters such as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the qcd parameter @xmath9 . in section  [ sec : baryon ] we show that the instanton , which is a quasiparticle in @xmath17 dimensions , becomes a skyrmion upon reduction to 4d , and thus describes the baryon .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "the model under consideration is described by the following lagrangian , but write all indices as lower indices for simplicity , unless it could lead to a confusion . ]",

    "the solution we wish to use to describe a baryon is static , i.e. , @xmath307 , and there is no dependence on @xmath308 . to see the behavior of the pion field we need to look at @xmath309 ( see ( [ sigmacont ] ) ) : @xmath310 we see that at every fixed @xmath162 the solution is a hedgehog , thus having the same topology as the skyrmion made of the pion field",
    ".    we shall now show that for an arbitrary background metric the topological charge of the instanton is equal to the baryon charge of the pion - field skyrmion .",
    "our discussion is very similar to that of refs .",
    "the 5d yang - mills theory possesses a conserved topological current , @xmath311 here @xmath312 is defined so that its elements are @xmath313 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath283 is a constant and absorb it into the gauge field , and drop the hat in the 5d lorentz indices in subsequent formulas .",
    "the boundaries are assumed to be @xmath257 .",
    "that this current is conserved , @xmath314 , can be shown by using the bianchi identity @xmath315}=0 $ ] .",
    "the topological charge of a static solution is @xmath316 the numerical coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ 5dtopcurr ] ) was chosen so that the static instanton has unit total charge .",
    "now consider a field configuration where the pion field , given by the wilson line along the @xmath162 coordinate ( [ sigmacont ] ) has a nontrivial winding , and @xmath317 goes to 0 at the boundaries . to compute the topological charge of this configuration , it is convenient to perform a gauge transformation to set @xmath318 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath319 according to ( [ sigmacont ] ) , @xmath320 .",
    "thus while @xmath321 remains 0 at the left boundary @xmath322 , it becomes nonzero at the right boundary : @xmath323 by using the identity @xmath324 one can rewrite the topological charge ( [ qff ] ) as @xmath325 since at @xmath322 @xmath326 and @xmath327 . by using eq .",
    "( [ aibound ] ) one transforms this expression to @xmath328.\\ ] ] it is now obvious that the topological charge becomes the winding number of the pion field .",

    "we considered a theory of an `` open moose '' given by lagrangian ( [ l ] ) illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : k ] .",
    "this model describes a multiplet of massless goldstone bosons and a tower of vector and axial vector mesons . we developed a formalism for calculating the mass spectrum and the coupling constants in this theory for arbitrary parameters of the moose , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and determine their values in the continuum limit , when the number of hidden symmetry groups @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "we applied this formalism to two exactly solvable realizations of the model and found that the physics of the lowest modes match quite well with the phenomenology of the @xmath83 , @xmath2 and @xmath78 mesons .",
    "we also find that the open - moose theory naturally incorporates the phenomenon of vector meson dominance .",
    "for example , the pion form factor is saturated by poles from a tower of vector mesons . moreover , since couplings between mesons are given by overlap integrals , the couplings of highly excited @xmath2 s to the pion are suppressed by the oscillations of their wave functions in the fifth dimension .",
    "this means that the pion form factor should be well approximated by the sum of contributions from a few lowest @xmath2 s . in the second example we considered ( the `` cosh '' background ) the situation",
    "is brought to an extreme : the pion form factor is saturated by a single pole  @xmath2-meson dominance .",
    "we verified that both weinberg s spectral sum rules are automatically obeyed , in a nontrivial way , in any open - moose theory .",
    "one of our original motivations was to include the excited vector mesons beyond the lowest @xmath78 .",
    "with respect to that goal , we achieved only limited success , at least within the two exactly solvable models we considered . on the one hand , we do find that vector and axial vector mesons alternate in the spectrum , as it seems to be the case in qcd , at least for a few excited states . on the other hand , in both our simple models ,",
    "the mass of an @xmath80-th state @xmath66 is @xmath329 at large @xmath80 , which seems to be in contradiction with the real world , and with the theoretical prejudice that @xmath330 .",
    "further study of different backgrounds might provide a model that reproduces desired features of excited mesons and help understand constraints that phenomenology and qcd theorems impose on functions @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "alternatively , it is also possible that the excited vector mesons have `` stringy '' nature and can not , in principle , be incorporated into our field - theoretical scheme . by a suitable choice of background , even an exactly solvable one .",
    "but we did not find such models viable in other respects . ]",
    "the success that the model enjoys in describing the lowest states can be attributed to an apparent property of low - energy qcd : at intermediate distances correlation functions are reasonably well saturated by a single pole . in the `` cosh '' model the excited mesons ensure the correct behavior of the ( averaged ) spectral densities , thus playing the role of the continuum .",
    "this explains why some results of qcd sum rules are well reproduced .",
    "we hope that the study of the open moose theories will deepen our understanding of qcd at the fundamental level .",
    "one intriguing fact discovered in these theories is the similarity to the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the procedure of calculating current - current correlators is essentially equivalent to the well - known ads / cft prescription : the correlators are given by the variational derivatives of the classical 5d action of the dual theory with respect to the sources living on the 4d boundary .",
    "there is overwhelming evidence that the @xmath331 supersymmetric yang - mills theory is described by a string theory .",
    "perhaps , an open moose theory is a low - energy limit of the string theory dual to qcd . in this regard ,",
    "the result we found in the `` cosh '' model , @xmath332 is reassuring in view of a general expectation that such a dual theory should have a coupling proportional to @xmath333 in the t hooft limit .    among the questions left for further study",
    "is the detailed phenomenology of isoscalar mesons ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , etc . ) .",
    "these mesons are described by an additional 5d abelian gauge field , which should be introduced into the action  ( [ 5ds ] ) .",
    "most of our results should generalize straighforwardly to this case .",
    "however , there is an important new issue that the isoscalar sector brings into the theory .",
    "the global u(1)@xmath334 symmetry must be explicitly broken , e.g. , @xmath11 should not be massless .",
    "it is very encouraging that the 5d formulation of the theory provides a very natural mechanism for this .",
    "it is the topological 5d chern - simons term of the form @xmath335 where @xmath336 is the 5d vector field describing isoscalars .",
    "this term breaks the u(1)@xmath334 symmetry in the desired way .",
    "in particular , it is not invariant under u(1)@xmath334 transformations on the 4d boundary ( although it is invariant under local transformations in the bulk of 5d ) .",
    "it is easy to see that it also provides @xmath337 and other anomalous processes in qcd .",
    "the coefficient of the term ( [ aff ] ) can be fixed by matching to qcd chiral anomaly , and is therefore proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "the term ( [ aff ] ) also couples the @xmath12 meson field to the baryon current , providing a hard - core repulsion between baryons , and preventing the baryon / instanton from shrinking to zero size ( this effect is the origin of the stabilization of the skyrmion observed in ref .",
    ". it would be also interesting to see how the open - moose theory realizes di  vecchia - veneziano - witten lagrangian  @xcite and the corresponding phenomenology .",
    "other avenues for future study are the incorporation of finite quark masses , extension to three flavors and realization of the wess - zumino - witten topological term ( which does require a 5th dimension  @xcite ) .",

    "<S> motivated by phenomenological models of hidden local symmetries and the ideas of dimensional deconstruction and gauge / gravity duality , we consider the model of an `` open moose . '' </S>",
    "<S> such a model has a large number @xmath0 of hidden gauge groups as well as a global chiral symmetry . in the continuum limit </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 the model becomes a 4 + 1 dimensional theory of a gauge field propagating in a dilaton background and an external space - time metric with two boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the model reproduces several well known phenomenological and theoretical aspects of low - energy hadron dynamics , such as vector meson dominance . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the general formulas for the mass spectrum , the decay constants of the pion and vector mesons , and the couplings between mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider two simple realizations , one with a flat metric and another with a `` cosh '' metric interpolating between two ads boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> for the pion form factor , the single pole @xmath2-meson dominance is exact in the latter case and approximate in the former case . </S>",
    "<S> we discover that an ads / cft - like prescription emerges in the computation of current - current correlators . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate on the role of the model in the theory dual to qcd . </S>"
