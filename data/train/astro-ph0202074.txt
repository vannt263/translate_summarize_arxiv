    "models for sources producing ultrahigh energy neutrinos can be divided into hadronic and non - hadronic ones , depending on whether protons play a key part in the neutrino production . in this work",
    "we shall limit ourselves to the former class of models , referring the reader to @xcite for a discussion of non - hadronic source models such as the decay of relic particles .",
    "independent of the specific source under consideration , the main idea behind hadronic neutrino production is that a beam of accelerated protons ( taken to be of power - law form , @xmath0 ) hitting a target produces pions , which subsequently decay and thus yield neutrinos . here , the target may consist of either protons or photons .    in case of a target made of protons ,",
    "if the pions decay prior to any interaction with the surrounding medium , the resulting neutrino production spectrum is of the same form as the original spectrum of accelerated protons , i.e. @xmath1 .",
    "otherwise , the neutrino spectrum is steepened @xcite .",
    "an important example of a photon target is given by the cosmic background radiation , which leads to the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmn cutoff .",
    "in neutrino sources , target photons may be produced by means of synchrotron radiation .",
    "assuming that the synchrotron photon spectrum is of the form @xmath2 , one may show that the corresponding neutrino spectrum is also a power law , @xmath3 @xcite .    in the following , we mention several examples of source models which have been proposed for ultrahigh energy neutrino production :",
    "neutrinos produced by cosmic - ray interactions in the terrestrial atmosphere can be detected with present - day water - based erenkov telescopes and thus serve as an important benchmark @xcite .",
    "the same processes responsible for neutrino production in the terrestrial atmosphere can also take place in the sun",
    ". however , the neutrino flux thus to be expected is so low that it will only be discernible with next - generation neutrino detectors @xcite .",
    "neutrons resulting from the photodisintegration of iron nuclei may be accelerated in the outer gap of the crab pulsar and may subsequently decay into protons . if these interact with matter in the nebula , pions and thus neutrinos can be produced @xcite .",
    "protons may be shock accelerated and by means of collisions in the remnant may produce pions and thus neutrinos @xcite .      in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , protons may be shock accelerated either in the accretion disk of the central black hole or in the jets .",
    "depending on the site of acceleration , either the thermal photons of the accretion disk or the synchrotron radiation in the jet may serve as the target needed for pion production ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that the detection of neutrinos emitted by agns would be a smoking gun for hadron acceleration .",
    "the ionized gas in a galaxy cluster might act as the target for cosmic rays escaping from cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "protons might be accelerated in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the main advantage of gamma - ray bursts is that they allow a precise timing , which reduces the background considerably .",
    "in addition , assuming that two neutrinos emitted at the same moment in a grb located at a distance @xmath4 arrive at different times @xmath5 and @xmath6 , one may compute the speed difference @xmath7 of the two neutrinos by means of @xmath8 hence grbs could offer a possibility for checking neutrino dispersion .",

    "the shaded region is the allowed range for the mpr flux bounds .",

    "( grb ) _ and the flux bound obtained by @xcite _ ( wb)_. no neutrino flavor oscillations are assumed.,width=313 ]",
    "the multitude ( and uncertainty ) of neutrino source models suggests the question whether one can obtain a generic upper neutrino flux bound , thus constraining the number of events to be expected from future neutrino telescopes . in order to construct such a bound ,",
    "we start by assuming that in a neutrino source all protons are confined within the acceleration region ( while neutrons and neutrinos may escape ) , that there is a power law target photon spectrum with index @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and that the upper limit on the cosmic ray proton spectrum as observed on earth has the form @xmath12 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "particle physics considerations then show that the neutrino production rate @xmath15 within the source is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the neutron production rate @xcite .",
    "the source contributes to the cosmic ray proton flux , if the neutron escape probability @xmath18 does not vanish . indeed , the cosmic ray production rate can be estimated as @xcite @xmath19 here @xmath20 constitutes the neutron optical depth for the source radius .",
    "finally , we note that the bolometric photon and neutrino luminosities are related by @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 @xcite",
    ".    we can now give a formal recipe for constructing generic upper flux bounds",
    "@xcite :    1 .   get the neutron production rate @xmath17 .",
    "note that due to the rescaling in step 4 , @xmath17 need to be known up to a factor of proportionality only .",
    "2 .   by means of eqs .",
    "[ eq : qnu ] and  [ eq : qcr ] compute the corresponding neutrino and cosmic ray proton production rates ( i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "3 .   integrate the neutrino and cosmic ray proton production rates over all sources in the universe to obtain the neutrino and cosmic ray proton intensities @xmath26 at the earth .",
    "formally , this may be done using the formula @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the redshift , @xmath29 the luminosity distance , @xmath30 the comoving volume , and @xmath31 the source density , which analogously to @xmath17 in step 1 needs to be known only up to a factor of proportionality .",
    "the modification factor @xmath32 takes into account the attenuation processes along the line of flight . for neutrinos , @xmath33 .",
    "the factor @xmath34 in the argument of @xmath35 describes the energy degradation due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "4 .   normalize @xmath36 and thus @xmath37 so that @xmath36 is tangent to the observational upper limit of the cosmic ray proton intensity or so that @xmath38-rays are nt overproduced ( whichever is the more stringent condition ) .",
    "it should be noted that the bounds thus computed pertain to hadronic source models only , so that there might be an additional contribution from non - hadronic sources .",
    "one may now use this recipe for computing various bounds :    generic bounds @xcite are obtained , if one assumes that the neutron production spectrum is given by @xmath39 with a cutoff energy @xmath40 and that the source distribution follows that of galaxies and agns .",
    "the corresponding cosmic ray proton flux as a function of @xmath40 is fitted to the observational bound .",
    "we shall refer to these bounds as the mannheim - protheroe - rachen ( mpr ) flux bounds .    in order to get a bound for egret blazars @xcite",
    ", we assume that the production rate of accelerated protons is of the form @xmath41 , corresponding to non - relativistic fermi acceleration , and that the spectral index of the target photon spectrum has the value @xmath22 . from @xmath42 and",
    "the proton loss time scale one may compute the proton spectrum @xmath43 in the source , and from @xmath43 and the timescale of @xmath44 the neutron production rate @xmath17 , which may serve as the starting point for the general recipe outlined above . here , as the production rates depend on the luminosity , the average over the luminosity function @xmath45 is used : @xmath46    for grbs @xcite one takes the spectrum of accelerated protons to be of the form @xmath47 , but assumes that the photon target spectral index is given by @xmath24 .",
    "the calculation can then be carried out analogously to that for the blazar bound .    finally , if it is assumed that the proton input spectrum is of the form @xmath47 and that the sources are optically thin for neutrons , one obtains the waxman&bahcall bound @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] various upper flux bounds for the muon neutrino flux from hadronic sources are shown .",
    "the decay of a charged pion leads to the production of one electron and two muon neutrinos , where here and in the following no distinction between particles and antiparticles is made .",
    "this implies that initially the ratio of the various neutrinos should be given by @xmath48 .",
    "however , during the flight to earth neutrino flavor oscillations should occur , leading to an equipartition among the various flavors @xcite .",
    "hence the flux ratio as measured on earth should have the value @xmath49 so that a considerable amount of tauon neutrinos is to be expected , although virtually no tauon neutrinos are produced within neutrino sources .",
    "neutrinos reaching a detector from below have to cross the inner earth first .",
    "this propagation can formally be described by means of the set @xcite @xmath50 of cascade equations , where @xmath51 denotes the total neutrino cross section of flavor @xmath52 , the sum runs over all flavors , and @xmath53 covers both neutrino - nucleon and leptonic neutrino interactions , and the decay of tauons . for the parton distributions we use the cteq5dis functions @xcite , and we discretize the transport equations .",
    "the resulting set of equations can then be solved semi - analytically .    as a rough approximation to the event rate @xmath54 due to neutrino detection in water - based erenkov telescopes",
    ", we employ the formula @xmath55 here again @xmath52 denotes the flavor .",
    "@xmath56 constitutes the effective detector area , @xmath57 the detector height , @xmath58 the matter density , and @xmath59 the proton mass .",
    "@xmath60 is the energy ( of the lepton @xmath52 ) which is degraded to @xmath61 along a path of length @xmath62 . in the following",
    ", we shall assume @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "whereas the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : detection ] describes fully contained events , the second term covers leptons originating outside the detector .",
    "it may be neglected for electrons and tauons .",
    "finally , it ought to be noted that the decay of tauons results in the production of both electrons and muons and hence contributes to the respective event rates .",
    "the formalism outlined in the previous section can be used to obtain the event rates corresponding to various of the flux bounds discussed in sect .  [",
    "sec : bounds ] .",
    "this has been carried out for the waxman&bahcall and the mpr flux bounds .",
    "the results ( for a lower energy cutoff of 100 gev ) are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundevents ] .    as in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundevents ] different bins correspond to the same solid angle , the form of the curves is a direct measure of attenuation effects due to crossing the earth .",
    "this suggests that one might use the event rate as a function of the nadir angle in order to perform a tomography of the inner earth @xcite .    to this end , we start by noting that the column density @xmath66 may be considered as the one - dimensional radon transform of the number density @xmath58 : @xmath67 here , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the distance from the middle of the earth and the normal vector of the line of integration , respectively . now",
    ", using the inversion formula for two - dimensional radon transforms @xcite one can show that @xmath70 and that one may thus invert eq .  [ eq : radon1d ] by means of @xmath71 where @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "however , if the initial neutrino spectrum ( before crossing the earth ) is assumed to be known , one may deduce the column density directly from the observed event rate .",
    "then eq .",
    "[ eq : inversion ] yields the density , so that a tomography is indeed possible .",
    "unfortunately , there is an important caveat : due to the statistical error @xmath74 in the detection rates , the column densities can be known only with a rather limited precision .",
    "we take this into account by either adding or subtracting @xmath74 throughout and comparing the results thus obtained with that for @xmath75 .",
    "the results of this analysis for a one - year run are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tomography ] for an mpr and for the waxman&bahcall flux bound .",
    "one can see that the maximum event rates to be expected for next - generation neutrino telescopes put severe constraints on a tomography of the inner earth ."
