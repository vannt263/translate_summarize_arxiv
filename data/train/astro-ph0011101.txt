    "contrary to a merging scenario ( maoz et al .",
    "1995 ) , which would seem to be precluded by the lack of significant tidal effects beyond the inner few hundred parsecs , these features more likely indicate an orbital dynamic at work in the inner disk . at an interpolated orbital velocity of 140 km / s and corresponding shear rate of -1360 km@xmath13 kpc@xmath31 ( see section 6 ) ,",

    "4a * ) was created by median smoothing the r - band image over a @xmath32 window and then subtracting the smoothed image from the original .",

    "the archival hst / wfpc2 v - band image of this region resolves the flocculent structure into spiral dust lanes of high pitch angle which cross through the nearly circular ring .",
    "the @xmath25 color image ( * fig . 4b * ) shows reddening along the western spiral arc seen in ( * fig . 4a * ) and in another arc to the ne , along with blue knots in the starburst ring .",
    "_ none of the fine - scale structures and reddened features in the optical inner disk have counterparts in the uit / fuv image . _ therefore , neither emitting nor absorbing structures , nor reddening dust lanes in the _ old disk _ can be defining the observed concentric fuv arcs to the sw and ne .",
    "we infer that the fuv arcs are recently - generated structures of emitting b and a - type stars and/or scattering clouds of low dust optical depth .",
    "we further speculate that the emitting and/or scattering fuv sources , being relatively young , are distributed in a much thinner disk than that associated with the optical fine - scale structures and reddened features , thus explaining the morphological differences between these two wavelength regimes .",
    "further insights on the stellar content of the inner disk can be gained from the iue spectroscopy presented in section 6 .",
    "the inner starburst ring in m94 is the single dominant emission feature in the fuv , h@xmath0 , and radio continuum bands .",
    "rectification of the galaxy to its nominal face - on orientation ( pa = 120@xmath8 @xmath33 [ mulder & van driel 1993 ] ) shows that the ring is almost perfectly circular , with a mean radius of 47@xmath1 ( 1.1 kpc ) and fwhm of 21@xmath1 ( 0.49 kpc ) .",
    "the latter measurement is based on doubling the measured hwhm of the emission _ beyond _ the mean radius , thereby excluding the diffuse contribution interior to the ring .",
    "adopting an inclination of 35@xmath8 , as in the dispersion orbit model of buta ( 1988 ) , would yield a finite but small ellipticity of 0.063 , with a 16@xmath8 offset between the kinematic line of nodes and projected major axis .",

    "a comparison of the fuv and h@xmath0 morphologies reveals strong similarities . *",
    "figure 5a * shows the h@xmath0 emission , and * figure 5b * shows the ratio of h@xmath0 and fuv intensities in the inner disk and ring .",
    "except for the spiral - like ridges of enhanced h@xmath0 emission to the wnw and ese , very little coherent variation in this ratio is evident in the ring . in particular , the intensity ratios do not show any radial displacement in the fuv emission relative to that at h@xmath0 . from this lack of radial structuring in the h@xmath0/fuv ratio , we can conclude that _ little evidence is found for outward or inward propagating starburst activity _ , as explained below .",
    "a morphological comparison of h@xmath0 and fuv emitting regions provides a useful means of tracking sequential patterns of star formation in disk galaxies .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission is dominated by the most massive and short - lived stars ( m @xmath34 20 m@xmath35 ) , while the fuv emission arises mostly from less massive , longer- lived stars ( 20 @xmath28 m / m@xmath35 @xmath28 2.5 ) . for an evolving star cluster with an imf typical of local star - forming regions , the h@xmath0 emission typically reaches a maximum within a million years of the star - forming episode , and",
    "quickly decays with an e - folding timescale of about 3 myr .",
    "by contrast , the fuv emission reaches a maximum at about 3 myr ( due to the onset of b - type supergiants ) , decaying to 1/e in yet another 3 myr .",
    "the h@xmath0/fuv ratio is seen to decrease by 2 orders of magnitude after 10 myr ( e.g. hill et al .",
    "subsequently , the h@xmath0 emission will vanish , while the fuv declines slowly for the next few 100 myrs .",
    "in the outward propagating starburst scenario , the h@xmath0 emission would concentrate where the propagating wavefront is located  on the outer perimeter of the fuv - emitting ring .",
    "inward propagating scenarios would have the h@xmath0 emission interior to the fuv ring .",
    "spatial displacements of h@xmath0 and fuv emission have been observed across the spiral arms of m51 ( oconnell 1997 ; petit et al .",
    "1996 ) , m74 ( marcum et al . 1997 ) , and ngc 4258 ( courtes et al . 1993 ) .",
    "these displacements have been interpreted as the result of spiral density waves concentrating gas along the insides of the spiral arms and subsequent migration of the evolving clusters past the spiral wave fronts .",
    "given the resolution of our images ( @xmath2100 pc ) and characteristic timescale between h@xmath0 and fuv maxima ( 3 myr ) , any residual propagation of starburst activity would have to proceed at a speed less than 35 km / s to avoid detection .",
    "implications of this propagation speed limit are discussed in section 7 .",
    "the arm - like enhancements in the h@xmath0/fuv ratio correspond to similar features in a recent co mapping with the bima interferometer ( wong et al .",
    "these arm - like extensions away from the ring have further analogues at b - band , where a complex spiral pattern is evident ( see next subsection ) .",
    "one of the most remarkable aspects of m94 s fuv emission morphology is the pair of knots on diametrically opposite sides of the nucleus .",
    "both knots have projected radii of approximately 130@xmath1 ( 2.9 kpc ) .",
    "a line drawn through the knots intersects the nucleus at a position angle of 105@xmath8 , intermediate between the pas of the inner starburst ring ( 127@xmath8 ) and the oval disk ( 95@xmath8 ) ( mollenhoff et al .",
    "the two knots are roughly 20@xmath1 ( 500 pc ) in size , with the eastern knot showing the more complex structure .",
    "only the eastern knot shows significantly in our continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 image ( * figure 5 * ) .",
    "other much smaller knots of fuv emission appear at low s / n to the sw , ssw , ene , and nne .",
    "the sw , ssw , and ene knots have faint counterparts in the light of h@xmath0 , while all of these features have counterparts at b - band ( see below ) .    * figure 6a * and * figure 6b * respectively show the b - band image before and after spatial filtering .",
    "the filtering in this case involves median smoothing over a @xmath36 window and then dividing the original image by this smoothed image .",
    "median normalized spatial filtering",
    "_ reveals fine - scale structure over a wide range of surface brightnesses ( e.g. waller et al .",
    "1998 ) . here , it highlights the starburst ring and bisymmetric knots as significant enhancements above the disk at b - band .",
    "the filtered image also reveals many flocculent spiral arms outside of the ring , whose relation with the knots is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "the western knot appears part of a dominant arm with a `` shingled '' morphology connecting to the ring in the northeast .",
    "the eastern knot appears to be associated with several arms , including one which would be the symmetric counterpart to the arm that links the western knot to the ring .",
    "the marginally detected fuv knots to the sw , ssw , ene , and nne all show enhanced b - band emission from associations of massive stars among the myriad spiral arms .    in summary , the bi - symmetric fuv knots have b - band counterparts which appear to be part of the complex spiral arm structure at these radii .",
    "their symmetric prominence on opposite sides of the nucleus , however , requires a dynamical explanation that is spatially more specific than that of the arms .",
    "similarly , the starburst ring can be regarded as an especially bright , tightly wound component of the overall spiral pattern , whose prominence also indicates special dynamical circumstances .",

    "therefore , it is possible that the @xmath89-yr old stellar population detected in the inner disk is the result of such an outward propagating wave .",
    "the striking difference in emission morphologies at fuv and red wavelengths provides further support for the starburst ring being a transient phenomenon which does not persist at any one radius for very long . either these resonant phenomena come and go , as the oval distortions undergo secular evolution , or their operating radii migrate in response to other dynamical influences on the stars and gas ( cf .",
