    "this system can also be seen as a generalization of the lorentz gas problem to the multi - particle case  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this system can be regarded as a model of binary mixtures with a disparate size ratio  @xcite .",
    "the immobile obstacles in the random media are interpreted as large particles in the binary liquids because of the huge asymmetry in time scales between the small and large particle components .    in recent years",
    ", various molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have been performed to study the slow dynamics of the fluids in random media  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the slow dynamics of mobile hard spheres in the presence of the immobile hard spheres of the same size has been intensively investigated using the replica method combined with the mode - coupling theory ( rmct )  @xcite .",
    "these studies have examined the dynamic phase transition from liquid to non - ergodic arrested states .",
    "two notable results were predicted .",
    "the first is that the slow dynamics can be characterized by two types of dynamics : type @xmath0 and type @xmath1 dynamics  @xcite .",
    "when the mobile particle density , @xmath2 , is large and the immobile particle density , @xmath3 , is small , the system undergoes a conventional glass transition , in which the onset of slow dynamics is signaled by the _",
    "discontinuous _ emergence of two - step relaxation in the density correlation function .",
    "this is referred to as type @xmath1 transition .",
    "as the immobile density @xmath3 increases , the glass transition point of the mobile particles decreases drastically . at an even larger @xmath3 ,",
    "the dynamics qualitatively changes ; one - step slow relaxation sets in at large wavelengths , in which the tail of the relaxation curve continuously grows and progressively propagates toward the smaller wavelengths as @xmath3 increases , until the dynamics of the mobile particle freezes .",
    "this freezing is a localization transition due to blocking by the percolating network of the immobile particles .",
    "this is called type @xmath0 transition . the crossover from type @xmath1 to type",
    "@xmath0 transition is reminiscent of the behaviors observed in many heterogeneous systems such as the glass - to - gel crossover of attractive colloids  @xcite and the glassy slow dynamics of binary mixture systems with a disparate size ratio  @xcite .",
    "the second prediction is the existence of a reentrant transition in the small @xmath4 regime , in which the arrested mobile particles melt as the mobile particle density @xmath4 _ increases _ at a fixed @xmath5 .        to verify these theoretical predictions , we  @xcite and kurzidim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have independently and numerically investigated fluids in immobile obstacles .",
    "all of these studies have confirmed that there is a crossover from type @xmath1 to type @xmath0 transition as the immobile particle density increases .",
    "these studies also found no reentrant transition for the system that was studied by rmct .",
    "we have also found that the dynamic arrest line ( or more precisely iso - relaxation - time line ) sensitively depends on the protocol that is used to generate the configuration of the randomly distributed immobile particles  @xcite .",
    "two types of these protocols have been studied ; the first is the quenched - annealed ( qa ) system , in which the immobile particles are initially equilibrated before their positions are quenched ( see fig .",
    "[ cartoon](a ) ) .",
    "mobile particles are then inserted into the system and their dynamics are monitored after equilibration .",
    "this qa protocol offers a natural choice to model the experimental setups of random media ( such as porous materials ) and has been adopted in the theoretical analysis of rmct  @xcite and in numerical studies by kurzidim _",
    "et al . _",
    "the second protocol studied is the equilibrated mixture ( em ) protocol , in which all of the particles are run in the simulation box and , after their equilibration , the motions of a fraction of the particles are quenched ( see fig .",
    "[ cartoon](b ) ) .",
    "the dynamics of the mobile component is monitored after waiting long enough for the mobile particles to equilibrate in the presence of the immobile particles .",
    "this protocol is appropriate as a model of the dynamics of the fast ( small ) particle component in binary mixtures with a disparate size ratio , in which the two time scales of each component are well separated .",
    "we found no reentrance for the system prepared with the qa protocol , but surprisingly , we did observe reentrance using the em protocol  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this reentrance is distinct from that predicted by rmct .",
    "it was speculated that this reentrance can be attributed solely to the configurations of the immobile particles prepared by the em protocol ; the configuration of immobile particles is automatically `` optimized '' to provide more pathways for the mobile particles than those prepared in the absence of mobile particles ( using the qa protocol ) .    in the present paper , we investigate the dynamical properties of the fluids in random obstacles ( which were also examined in our previous papers  @xcite ) in more detail , focusing on various quantities that characterize the slow dynamics near the glass and the localization transition .",
    "we evaluate the nonlinear dynamic susceptibility , the non - gaussian parameter , and the fragility across the entire parameter space of @xmath6 .",

    "we found that all of these quantities exhibited qualitative changes as the density of the mobile / immobile particles was varied . at the limit of small immobile particle density ,",
    "all of the observed quantities indicated the strong signs of dynamic heterogeneities near the glass transition point , such as the enhanced nonlinear dynamic susceptibility , the increased peak heights of the non - gaussian parameter , and the fragile behavior of the relaxation time in its temperature dependence . at the opposite limit , in which a small number of mobile particles diffuse amid abundant obstacle particles , the signs of the dynamic heterogeneities were all suppressed .",
    "the nonlinear dynamic susceptibility and the non - gaussian parameter exhibited no peak , and the temperature dependence of the relaxation time was almost arrhenius . to understand the underling physics behind the reentrant transition near the type @xmath1 to type @xmath0 crossover , we have carefully quantified how the statistical properties of configuration of the random matrix can be altered by the different protocols used to generate them by calculating the pore - size distribution generated by the immobile particles . throughout this paper , we refer the change from type @xmath1 to type @xmath0 dynamics as the crossover . according to rmct  @xcite ,",
