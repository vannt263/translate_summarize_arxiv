    "weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) direct detection experiments aim to directly detect non - baryonic dark matter via the elastic scattering of wimps on detector nuclei , and are presently reaching the sensitivity required to detect neutralinos ( the lightest supersymmetric particle and an excellent wimp candidate ) .",
    "since the expected event rates are very small ( @xmath0 counts @xmath1 ) distinguishing a putative weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) signal from backgrounds due to , for instance , neutrons from cosmic - ray induced muons or natural radioactivity , is crucial .",
    "the earth s motion about the sun provides two potential wimp smoking guns : i ) an annual modulation  @xcite and ii ) a strong direction dependence  @xcite of the event rate . in principle the dependence of the differential event rate on the atomic mass of the detector ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) is a third possibility , however this would require good control of systematics for detectors composed of different materials .",
    "the dama ( * da*rk * ma*tter ) collaboration have , using @xmath2 of nai crystals and an exposure of @xmath3 , observed an annual modulation in their event rate  @xcite , which they interpret as a wimp signal .",
    "taken at face value the allowed region of wimp mass and cross - section parameter space is incompatible with the exclusion limits from other experiments ( such as the * c*ryogenic * d*ark * m*atter * s*earch , edelweiss and zeplin i )  @xcite , however the form of the wimp annual modulation signal , in particular its phase , depends sensitively on the local wimp velocity distribution  @xcite  .",
    "it is , however , difficult to exclude the possibility that the annual modulation could be due to some previously unidentified background .",
    "the direction dependence of the wimp scattering rate has several advantages over the annual modulation .",
    "firstly , the amplitude of the annual modulation is typically of order a few per - cent  @xcite while the event rate in the forward direction is roughly an order of magnitude larger than that in the backward direction  @xcite .",
    "secondly it is difficult for the directional signal to be mimicked by backgrounds ; in most cases ( a point source in the lab is a possible exception ) a background which is anisotropic in the laboratory frame will be isotropic in the galactic rest frame as the , time dependent , conversion between the lab and galactic co - ordinate frames will wash out any lab specific features .",
    "furthermore the mean direction , in the lab , of wimp induced recoils will vary over a sidereal day due to the rotation of the earth  @xcite . designing a detector capable of measuring the directions of sub-100",
    "kev nuclear recoils is however a considerable challenge .",
    "prototype directional detectors based on roton anisotropy in liquid he  @xcite , phonon anisotropy in baf crystals  @xcite and the anisotropic scintillation properties of stilbene  @xcite have been tested , however low pressure gas time projection chambers ( tpcs ) , such as drift ( * d*irectional * r*ecoil * i*dentification * f*rom * t*racks )  @xcite and newage  @xcite , seem to offer the best prospects for a workable detector . in discriminating a wimp signal from isotropic backgrounds",
    "it is therefore crucial to take into account the accuracy with which recoil directions can be measured by such a detector .",
    "furthermore , the direction dependence of the recoil rate depends on the local wimp velocity distribution  @xcite . whilst this opens up the exciting possibility of experimentally probing the local dark matter distribution if wimps are detected ( i.e. doing wimp astronomy ) , it is also crucial that uncertainties in this distribution are accounted for when designing tests for discriminating a wimp signal from isotropic backgrounds .",
    "earlier studies have found that as few as 30 events would be required to distinguish a wimp induced signal from isotropic backgrounds  @xcite and that with of order hundreds of events it may be possible to distinguish between different models for the galactic halo  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we improve on these works by including the uncertainty in the reconstruction of the nuclear recoil direction and applying non - parametric tests to unbinned data . in sec .",

    "a , b and c we outline the calculation of the earth s orbital velocity , the statistics used and the hypothesis testing formalism respectively .",
    "the simplest possible model of the milky way ( mw ) halo is an isotropic sphere with density distribution @xmath4 , in which case the velocity distribution at all positions within the halo is maxwellian : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , the velocity dispersion , is related to the asymptotic circular velocity ( which we take throughout to be @xmath7 ) by @xmath8 .",
    "observations and numerical simulations indicate that galaxy halos are in fact triaxial and anisotropic and contain substructure .",
    "numerical simulations produce both prolate ( @xmath9 ) and oblate ( @xmath10 ) halos ( where @xmath11 are the lengths of the long , intermediate and short principal axes of the density distribution respectively )  @xcite .",
    "to date only cluster sized halos have been simulated in large numbers . ref .",
    "@xcite found that the shape parameters of such large halos lie in the ranges @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however the axial ratios vary with radius within a given halo , depending at least partly on the merger history of the halo . ref .",
    "@xcite studied two high resolution simulations of mw size halos , one halo had @xmath14 , the other @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these simulations contain only collision - less matter , and the addition of baryons leads to halos that are less triaxial , especially in the central regions  @xcite .",

    "we consider two anisotropic and/or triaxial halo models : the logarithmic ellipsoidal model  @xcite and the osipkov - merritt model  @xcite .",
    "we summarize these models briefly below",
    ". for further details see either the original papers  @xcite or refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic ellipsoidal model  @xcite is the simplest triaxial , scale free generalization of the isothermal sphere , its shape and velocity anisotropy being independent of radius .",
    "this model was studied in detail , in the context of wimp direct detection , by evans , carollo and de zeeuw  @xcite and has since been used widely in calculations of the expected wimp signals  @xcite . in this model",
    ", it is assumed that the principle axes of the velocity distribution are aligned with conical co - ordinates , and in any of the planes of the halo conical co - ordinates coincide with local cylindrical polar co - ordinates and the local wimp distribution can be approximated by a multi - variate gaussian : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the radial , azimuthal and polar velocity dispersions respectively .",
    "these dispersions are given in terms of parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 that are related to the halo axis ratios and @xmath28 which is related to the isotropy parameter @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "osipkov - merritt models  @xcite provide self - consistent radially anisotropic velocity distribution functions for halos with spherically symmetric density profiles , with velocity anisotropy @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the anisotropy radius .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and assume that the mw has an nfw profile  @xcite with scale radius @xmath31kpc   whatever profile is used . ] and fix @xmath32 and @xmath33 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , corresponding to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and calculate the local velocity distribution using the fitting functions in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the parameters of the fiducial halo models which we consider are chosen to span the range of halo properties discussed above and are summarized in table  [ hm : param : def ] .",
    "some of the triaxial models ( numbers 6 - 9 ) are rather extreme ( with @xmath36 ) , however they serve as a best / worse case scenario allow us to assess whether the deviation of the recoil spectrum from that produced by the standard halo is detectable / problematic .",
    "the extent to which the local wimp distribution is smooth is an open question  @xcite , however it is certainly possible that a stream of high velocity particles from a late accreted sub - halo could be passing through the solar neighborhood  @xcite and would produce a potentially distinctive signal in direct detection experiments  @xcite .",
    "indeed one of the tidal tails of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( sgr ) passes close to the solar neighborhood  @xcite .",
    "helmi et al .",
    "@xcite previously discovered a group of halo stars in the solar neighborhood moving coherently with mean velocity in galactic coordinates @xmath37 and freese et al .",
    "@xcite have argued that these stars are in fact part of the sgr tidal stream .",
    "this interpretation is somewhat controversial .",
    "firstly ( as noted by freese et al .",
    ") there is a discrepancy between the measured velocity of these stars and that expected for the sgr stream .",
    "secondly , there is a second lower density stellar stream in the solar neighborhood moving in the opposite direction  @xcite which is not expected for debris associated with sgr .",
    "finally the comparison of detailed simulations of the kinematics of the sgr stream with measured radial velocities of sgr stream stars appears to indicate that the stream does not pass through the solar neighborhood  @xcite .",
    "none the less there is a debris stream passing through the solar neighborhood regardless of whether or not it originated from the sgr dwarf galaxy .",
    "we therefore follow ref .",
    "@xcite and assume that there is dark matter associated with the stream and model its velocity distribution of wimps as a maxwellian distribution with bulk velocity @xmath38 , and velocity dispersion @xmath39 : @xmath40 we take @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , ( towards the lower and upper ends of the range of values suggested in ref .",

    "( [ beta ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     overall , the two coordinate dependent tests of isotropy , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , have the lowest @xmath47 values and are thus the most powerful tests for rejecting isotropy .",
    "all the coordinate independent tests typically require 1.5 - 2 times more events to reject isotropy for a given halo model ( for both vectorial and axial data ) .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising for the models 1 - 11 however , the coordinate dependent tests are also the most powerful for rejecting isotropy in model 12 which includes a @xmath48 contribution to the local wimp density from a tidal stream .",
    "the vectorial coordinate independent tests ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) all have very similar values of @xmath47 and are hence equally powerful for rejecting isotropy of recoils .",
    "the same is true of the axial coordinate independent tests ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , however @xmath47 is of order ten times larger for these tests than for the vectorial tests , and there is much greater variation between the fiducial halo models .",
    "both of these effects are due to the form of the recoil direction distribution and the way in which lack of knowledge of the recoil sense changes this form .",
    "while most of the recoil arrival directions lie in the forward hemisphere , @xmath54 , a non - negligible ( halo model dependent ) number lie in the backward hemisphere .",
    "for the vectorial tests , these backward events are not a problem as the tests can distinguish between the forward and backward hemispheres .",
    "when only the recoil axis is known , events in the backward hemisphere are effectively ` added ' to the forward hemisphere , reducing the degree of anisotropy .",
    "halo model 6 has the smallest rate in the backward hemisphere and thus the lowest @xmath47 for both vectorial and axial tests , while model 10 has the largest backward rate and therefore has higher @xmath47 values with axial tests . in general the broader the local wimp velocity distribution , the greater",
    "the number of events in the backward hemisphere , and hence a larger number of events are required to reject isotropy if the sense of the recoil directions are not known .    ignoring the detector response",
    "only marginally reduces the number of events required for the vectorial tests , however the number of events required for the axial tests are decreased by a factor of roughly two . for the hypothetical detector with perfect reconstruction and zero energy threshold the number of events required increases , relative to the 20 kev perfect reconstruction case , by a factor of @xmath55 for the vectorial ( axial ) statistics .",
    "the number of events required increases since , as is well known  @xcite , the anisotropy of the recoil directions decreases with decreasing recoil energy .",
    "the total recoil rate with a 0 kev threshold is roughly twice that with a 20 kev threshold , therefore for the vectorial statistics the exposure required to detect a wimp signal is essentially unchanged , while for the axial statistics ( i.e. if it is not posible to measure the senses of the recoils ) the lower threshold would actually increases the exposure required .",
    "we now translate the number of events required to reject isotropy for the realistic detector into the equivalent detector exposure , @xmath56 , required to observe this number of events .",
    "if the senses of the recoil directions are observed , isotropy could be rejected at @xmath57 confidence in @xmath57 of experiments for @xmath58 and @xmath59 with an exposure of @xmath60 ( i.e. a 100 kg detector operating for a period of 2 - 3 years ) . for a detector only capable of measuring the recoil axes a @xmath61 exposure would be able to reject isotropy at the same confidence level and acceptance down to @xmath62 .",
    "once an observed anomalous recoil signal is found to be incompatible ( at some confidence level ) with isotropy the next question to pose is ` is the observed distribution consistent with a spherical halo ? ' .",
    "a generic feature of triaxial halo models is a flattening of the recoil distribution towards the galactic plane , or more generally , flattened along one principal axis of the local velocity distribution .",
    "this type of distribution can be probed using tests for rotational symmetry about a specified direction or axis . in the case of smooth halo models this direction / axis",
    "is the direction of motion of the earth through the mw halo , which over the year , averages to the direction of motion of the sun , @xmath63  .",
    "we focus here on the two fiducial halo models for which the recoil distribution deviates most from that produced by the standard halo model : the logarithmic ellipsoidal models 5 ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , long axis ) and 7 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath66 , intermediate axis )   and find the number of events required to reject rotational symmetry , @xmath69 , using the kuiper statistic @xmath70 as defined in appendix  [ rotsymtest : a ] .",
    "we find that halo model 5 has @xmath71 over a large range of @xmath72 values , and of order 5000 - 8000 events would be required to reject rotational symmetry at @xmath73 confidence with similar acceptance .",
    "in contrast for halo model 7 ( which is more extreme ) @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "so while rotational symmetry of the recoil distribution can be rejected at high confidence and acceptance for this , rather extreme , halo model , it requires 10 - 50 times the number of events required to reject isotropy ( depending on whether vectors or axes are measured in the latter case ) .",
    "converting these numbers to the equivalent exposures in @xmath76 gives @xmath77 .",
    "hence for the @xmath78 exposure considered in the previous subsection , rotational symmetry could be rejected at @xmath79 confidence down to @xmath80 for @xmath81 , independent of whether the senses of the recoils can be measured .",
    "the sensitivity of a tpc - based directional detector for rejecting a spherical halo if the real mw halo is significantly triaxial using this statistic , is therefore several orders of magnitude lower than for rejecting isotropy of recoil directions .",
    "devising other tests that may be a more powerful probe of the flattening of the recoil distribution produced by non - spherical halo models is therefore an important task .",
    "tidal streams will typically have a velocity dispersion which is small compared to their velocity relative to the solar system and therefore the recoil distribution due to wimps from a stream will be peaked in the hemisphere whose pole points in the direction of the stream velocity .",
    "the net ( stream plus smooth background wimp distribution ) peak direction depends on the fraction of the local density that the tidal stream contributes .",
    "[ sgr : angle ] shows the angle between the direction of the sun s motion @xmath82 and the direction of the peak in the recoil distribution produced by a maxwellian halo plus a stream with velocity @xmath83 as a function of the local wimp density contributed by the stream . for the @xmath84 range of stream densities suggested by  @xcite ,",
    "the angle is in the range @xmath85 .",
    "this feature suggests that the presence of a wimp stream in the solar neighborhood could be tested for by comparing the median direction of the observed recoil vectors with the ( known ) direction of solar motion .",
    "function of the fraction of the local wimp density contributed by the stream , @xmath86.,width=321 ]    for @xmath87 ( which is at the upper end of the range of values suggested in  @xcite , and therefore provides a lower limit on the number of events required ) , we find that the minimum number of events required to reject @xmath88 as the median direction , @xmath89 , using the @xmath90 test as defined in appendix  [ dirtest : a ] is @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "comparing these numbers with those required to reject isotropy of recoils for this stream density , it can be seen that @xmath93 times more events are needed to reject the direction of the solar motion as the median recoil direction .",
    "these numbers of events would be achievable with a @xmath61 exposure for wimp - proton cross sections down to @xmath94 for @xmath95 .    in the case of axial recoil directions ,",
    "the @xmath90 test can not be applied , however , the rotational symmetry test presented in appendix  [ rotsymtest : a ] can be used since the recoil distribution will not be rotationally symmetric about @xmath88 in the presence of a stream and we find @xmath96 for @xmath92 .",
    "these numbers are roughly twice those for the @xmath90 test , and also for rejecting isotropy with axial data .",
    "thus with only axial data , a @xmath61 exposure would be sufficient to identify the presence of a tidal stream with properties as described in sec .",
    "[ stream ] comprising @xmath48 of the local wimp density for wimp - proton cross sections down to @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we caution that these numbers have been calculated for parameter values at the optimistic ends of the ranges estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. high density and low velocity dispersion . a lower stream density and/or a higher velocity dispersion would give a peak recoil direction closer to the mean direction of motion of the sun , and make the deviation due to the stream harder to detect .",
    "for the most pessimistic case of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the net wimp flux and recoil rate are virtually indistinguishable from those for the standard halo model and tens of thousands of events would be needed to detect the stream .",
    "in general the directional detectability of cold streams of wimps will clearly depend on how much their bulk velocity deviates from the direction of solar motion .",
    "we have studied the application of non - parametric tests , developed for the analysis of spherical data  @xcite , to the analysis of simulated data as expected from a tpc - based directional wimp detector  @xcite , taking into account the uncertainties in the reconstruction of the nuclear recoil directions .",
    "these tests , unlike likelihood analysis , do not require any assumptions about the form of the local wimp velocity distribution .",
    "this is advantageous as even if the properties ( i.e. shape , velocity anisotropy , and density profile ) of the mw halo at the solar radius were accurately determined there would likely be a wide range of local velocity distributions consistent with these properties .    for a range of fiducial anisotropic and/or triaxial halo models , with parameters chosen to reproduce the range of properties found in simulations / observations of dark matter halos , we calculate the number of events required to distinguish the wimp directional signal from an isotropic background using a variety of tests .",
    "the most powerful test is the , co - ordinate system dependent , test of the mean angle between the observed nuclear recoils and the direction of motion of the sun , which takes advantage of the fact that , for a smooth halo , the recoil rate is peaked in the direction of the sun s motion . we find that if the senses of the recoils are known then of order ten events will be sufficient to distinguish a wimp signal from an isotropic background for all of the halo models considered , with the uncertainties in reconstructing the recoil direction only mildly increasing the required number of events .",
    "if the senses of the recoils are not known the number of events required is an order of magnitude larger , with a large variation between halo models and the recoil resolution is now an important factor .",
    "the number of events required would be significantly larger if the wimp velocity distribution _ in the rest frame of the detector _ is close to isotropic  @xcite , which could be the case if the mw halo is co - rotating or if the local dark matter density has a significant contribution from a cold flow with direction so as to cancel out the front - rear asymmetry from the smooth background distribution  @xcite , however for halos formed hierarchically ( as is the case in cold dark matter cosmologies ) neither of these possibilities are expected to occur ( see e.g. ref .",
    "our conclusions for the case where the recoil senses are known are in broad agreement with the results of ref .",
    "it is reassuring that the realistic modeling of detector properties and the use of statistics that can be applied to real data do not significantly degrade the expected detection power of directional experiments .",
    "halo models which produce significantly different wimp flux distributions , unfortunately give very similar recoil rates .",
    "we find that distinguishing between halo models , in particular determining whether the mw halo is ( close to ) spherical , using tests of rotational symmetry will require thousands of events .",
    "gondolo has shown that the recoil momentum spectrum is the radon transform of the wimp velocity distribution  @xcite . in theory",
    "the transform could be inverted to directly measure the wimp velocity distribution from the measured recoil momentum distribution , however the inversion algorithms available in the literature require large numbers of events  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as we have shown , the uncertainties in the reconstruction of the recoil directions due to multiple scattering and diffusion have a significant effect on the observed recoil distribution and it is not possible to apply this inversion to real data . developing techniques to distinguish between the recoil distributions expected from different halo models , for finite amounts of data and taking into account the experimental resolution , is therefore of key importance for the full astronomical exploitation of data from directional detectors .",
    "if a significant fraction of the local dark matter is in a cold flow ( with velocity dispersion far smaller than its bulk velocity ) then the peak recoil direction will deviate from the direction of the solar motion .",
    "in fact a stream of halos stars has been found in the solar neighborhood  @xcite and using values for the properties of the stream at the optimistic end of the ranges estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite this deviation could be detected with of order a hundred events even if the sense of the nuclear recoils is not measurable .",
    "this illustrates that if the galactic dark matter is in the form of wimps then wimp directional detectors , such as drift  @xcite , will be able to do ` wimp astronomy ' .",

    "the modified kuiper statistic is defined as @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the ( unmodified ) kuiper statistic @xmath165 and @xmath166 as there is no general formula for the distribution of @xmath167 under the null hypothesis of rotational symmetry , we use monte carlos to generate the null probability distribution assuming the standard halo model   would give the same null distribution for @xmath168 . ] .      for vectorial data ,",
    "the median direction is defined as the direction @xmath169 which minimizes the sum of arclengths between @xmath169 and the sample vectors  @xcite , and can found by minimizing the quantity @xmath170 while for axial data an estimate of the principal axis of the distribution is provided by the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the scatter matrix @xmath133 .",
    "a test of compatibility between the measured median direction and a hypothesized median direction @xmath158 for vectorial data can be performed  @xcite by first rotating the data so that the polar angles are measured relative to a pole in the direction of the sample median @xmath169 and then calculating the matrix @xmath171 @xmath172 where @xmath173 from the rotated sample vectors .",
    "the sample vectors are rotated again so that their polar angles are measured relative to a pole in the direction of the hypothesized median using and the vector @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the azimuthal angle of the ith sample vector relative to a pole at @xmath158 is calculated .",
    "finally the test statistic @xmath176 , is defined as @xmath177 and is distributed as @xmath178 for samples drawn from a distribution with median direction @xmath158 .",
    "for each halo model considered we use monte carlo simulations to generate @xmath72 recoil scattering events in each of @xmath179 experiments , for values of @xmath72 between 5 and 400 ( the lower value corresponding to the point at which an anomalous recoil signal would first be identified at high confidence ) . for each experiment",
    "the test statistic @xmath180 is calculated from the @xmath72 recoil directions used to give the probability distribution of the statistic , @xmath181 , as a function of the number of recoil events .",
    "the probability distribution for the null hypothesis of isotropy , @xmath182 , is calculated using analytical expression where available and otherwise via monte carlo simulations . as in standard hypothesis testing",
    ", the overlap between these two distributions allows the probability   with which the null and alternative hypotheses can be rejected or accepted to be calculated . for a given value @xmath183 , the rejection factor",
    "@xmath184 is the probability of measuring @xmath185 if the null hypothesis is true : @xmath186 the rejection factor thus gives the confidence level with which the null hypothesis can be rejected given a particular value of the test statistic @xmath187 .",
    "for the same value of the test statistic @xmath183 , the acceptance factor @xmath188 is the probability of measuring @xmath189 if the alternative hypothesis is true @xmath190 equivalently , under the frequentist definition of probability , it is the fraction of experiments in which the alternative hypothesis is true that measure @xmath189 and thus reject the null hypothesis at confidence level @xmath184 .    by calculating @xmath184 and @xmath188 from the probability distributions of the test statistic for the null and alternative hypothesis as a function of @xmath72 , an ` acceptance - rejection ' plot",
    "can be built up for each value of @xmath72 and for any given level of rejection , @xmath191 , the level of acceptance @xmath192 achievable for each recoil sample size @xmath72 calculated .",
    "in other words we find the @xmath72 such that ` for @xmath72 observed recoils , the null hypothesis is rejected at the @xmath193 confidence level in @xmath194 of experiments in which the alternative hypothesis is true ' .",
    "clearly , a high value of @xmath191 is required to reject the null hypothesis at high confidence .",
    "a high acceptance is also required ; if , for instance , @xmath195 then only 1 in 10 experiments will be able to reject the null hypothesis at the given @xmath191 , furthermore if @xmath192 is low , the null hypothesis could sometimes be erroneously rejected at a given confidence level with a low number of events due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "we therefore use @xmath196 as our criteria , and calculate the corresponding minimum number of events required .",
