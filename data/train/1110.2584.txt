    "the existence of states at precise zero energy in the spectrum of a relativistically invariant dirac equation with underlying topological defects @xcite , recently attracted ample interest , following the successful fabrication of _ graphene_. the extent of the spectrum over the positive and the negative energies provides robustness to such states at the middle of the spectrum against _ weak _ local perturbations . the number of zero energy states , however , depends only on the universal properties : total magnetic flux enclosed by the system @xcite , kink of the mass @xcite , and the vorticity of a mass vortex @xcite .",
    "for example , a half - filled landau level at zero energy , leads to the formation of hall plateaus at fillings @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the existence of zero energy modes can lead to fractionalization of quantum numbers , e.g. , _",
    "@xcite , majorana modes in the core of the superconducting vortex @xcite or half - vortex @xcite and additional competing order parameters in the core of the vortex @xcite .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) scaling of longitudinal resistivity ( @xmath1 ) in neutral graphene strongly suggests the possibility of vortex excitations in graphene subject to the magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "vortex - zero modes in the dirac spectrum can exist in the presence of either real _ or _ pseudo magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the nature of the electronic ground state in the presence of fictitious gauge field lately gained attention following the experimental realization of the strain induced fields @xcite . in the presence of uniform real ( @xmath2 ) _ and _ pseudo ( @xmath3 ) magnetic fields , quantized hall conductivity in graphene is expected to discern plateaus at _ all _ integer values of @xmath4 , however , at _ noninteger fillings _",
    ", when the former is kept stronger",
    ". the plateau of hall conductivity with @xmath5 , can be formed by developing a _ ferrimagnet _ order , due to distinct degeneracies of two inter - penetrating relativistic landau levels living in the vicinity of two inequivalent dirac points .",
    "otherwise , their degeneracies are proportional to the effective gauge fields near the dirac points , @xmath6 , respectively @xcite .",
    "+ a fundamental question is , therefore , raised : does the vortex like defect have any zero energy mode when graphene is subject to both the real _ and _ the pseudo magnetic fields ?",
    "deposition of graphene on a metallic substrate at relatively high temperatures , followed by cooling , produces a strain induced pseudo ( axial ) magnetic field due to the mismatch in compressibility with the substrate @xcite .",
    "this system can then be placed in a real magnetic field .",
    "recently , a hexagonal honeycomb lattice has been realized in an optical lattice system ( ols)@xcite .",
    "one can , therefore , study the proposed scenario in honeycomb ols as well . in the ols ,",
    "a magnetic field is introduced via synthetic gauge potentials , and its strength can be varied over a wide range @xcite . on the other hand , a pseudo magnetic field can arise from specific modulations of the nearest - neighbor hopping ( nnh ) amplitudes _ only _ @xcite .",
    "+ in graphene possible candidates with requisite u(1 ) symmetry are antiferromagnet ( af ) , qquantum spin hall orders projected onto the easy plane and the kekul bond density wave ( kbdw ) .",
    "the former two can acquire an easy plane in the magnetic field due to the zeeman coupling @xcite .",
    "otherwise , af and qsh phases are energetically favored by strong onsite @xcite and second - neighbor repulsions , respectively @xcite .",
    "kbdw can be stabilized by electron - phonon interactions @xcite .",
    "however , a qsh phase can be realized even at sufficiently weak next - neighbor repulsion when a fictitious magnetic field penetrates graphene @xcite .",
    "immaterial of the vortex nature of dirac quasi - particles we find that there are always _ two _ zero energy modes .",
    "however , categorically two different situations arise : when the underlying order parameters do not couple two inequivalent dirac points , e.g. , af and qsh orders , zero energy modes have two different characteristic lengths . with underlying kbdw order ,",
    "two zero energy modes differ from the ones in the absence of pseudo fields only by an overall factor , hence , enjoy a unique length scale . in the former situation , we show that the zero modes can be delocalized from each other arbitrarily by tuning the relative strength of the fields _ only_. the present mechanism can , therefore , allow one to localize a single zero mode near , while pushing the other one far from , the vortex - core .",
    "the charge and the magnetization then exhibit _ oscillatory _ behavior , while restoring their usual quantization only at large distances .",
    "a previous study shows that in the absence of gauge fields the zero energy modes have the same decay lengths , hence , exact quantization is restored everywhere @xcite . additionally ,",
    "if there exists a half - skyrmion of af order , however weak , which otherwise splits the zero modes if uniform , maximally lowers the energy by filling the state with shorter length scale .",
    "the zero energy states can be computed exactly if the fields are uniform , although they always exist for any arbitrary flux profile and/or shape of the vortex mass .",
    "tuning the strength of the synthetic gauge fields and/or modulated nnh , thereby of pseudo magnetic fields , one can grasp peculiarities of these zero modes on honeycomb olss .",
