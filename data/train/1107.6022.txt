    "the study of frustration in magnetism has been a very active field of research in the recent past , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "while experimentally - realizable frustrated magnets typically have a closer correspondence to quantum ( i.e. , heisenberg or @xmath7 ) spin models than to classical , ising - like ones , their behavior turns out to be rather intricate .",
    "thus , theoretical and/or numerical investigation of frustrated classical spin systems may , by virtue of their simplified character , help unravel some basic features which are common to frustrated magnets in general . in this paper",
    "we investigate two - dimensional spin-@xmath0 ising systems on a square lattice with first- and second - neighbor couplings , both antiferromagnetic , in the presence of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , nn and nnn stand respectively for next - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor pairs , and @xmath11 . here",
    ", all fields , coupling strengths and temperatures are given in units of @xmath9 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we have kept @xmath12 in all calculations reported in this work , except at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : h=0 ] , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 were briefly considered ( both for @xmath15 ) .    in line with the initial considerations given above ,",
    "this may be considered a classical approximation for the @xmath16 ( heisenberg ) model  @xcite . nevertheless , as shown in the following , the model described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : def ] ) exhibits intricate features of its own , several of which are not fully understood so far .",
    "depending on the relative strength of the associated parameters , such setup of competing interactions can generate various types of ordered phases at low temperature ; more often than not , the transitions between these and the high - temperature ( paramagnetic ) state do not belong to the standard ising universality class  @xcite .",
    "the problem studied here has been analyzed by several numerical techniques in the past ; refs .",
    "provide excellent summaries of earlier work , as well as illustrations of the use of up - to - date monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation techniques for this case .",
    "we use transfer - matrix ( tm ) methods  @xcite , in conjunction with finite - size scaling  @xcite and conformal invariance  @xcite concepts , to determine the location of the phase boundaries of systems described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : def ] ) , and the universality classes of the associated phase transitions .",
    "tm methods , especially in the strip geometry used in this work , are to some extent complementary to mc simulations , in that they provide straightforward procedures for evaluation of the conformal anomaly , or central charge  @xcite , as well as the decay - of - correlations exponent @xmath6 ( via the amplitude - exponent relationship  @xcite ) .",
    "both quantities play an important role in the identification of the universality classes pertaining to phase transitions in two - dimensional systems , and neither is directly accessible via mc methods ( although direct estimates of @xmath6 can be produced by following the decay of spin - spin correlations with distance in an mc context , no simple relationship applies , such as the one given by conformal invariance on strips  @xcite ) . on the other hand , similarly to mc techniques",
    ", tm calculations also provide estimates of critical temperatures , specific heats , magnetizations , and susceptibilities .",
    "in section  [ sec : calc ] we recall the calculational methods used , as well as the finite - size scaling concepts and techniques employed in the analysis of our results .",

    "results for @xmath22 are available  @xcite .    with @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the two largest eigenvalues ( in absolute value ) of the tm ,",
    "the dimensionless free energy per site is given by @xmath25 , while @xmath26 is the inverse correlation length on a strip of width @xmath18 sites  @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that we do not make any assumptions about symmetry properties of the tm s eigenvectors .",
    "starting from the full set of @xmath27 basis vectors , the eigenvector @xmath28 , corresponding to @xmath23 , is isolated by the power method , while @xmath29 is again extracted via the power method , combined with repeated gram - schmidt orthogonalization to @xmath28 . this way we make sure that the most strongly diverging correlation length is evaluated , that is , the one which truly corresponds to the order parameter for the transition under scrutiny .",
    "this is especially relevant in the present case , where critical lines corresponding to order parameters of differing symmetries can become very close ( see section  [ sec : h>0 ] below ) .",
    "here we assume that the transition is always of second order , which is implicit in the statements made in the preceding paragraph .",
    "by now this seems out of doubt , at least for @xmath30 which is the parameter range of interest here  @xcite . for fixed @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,",

    "estimates of the thermal exponent @xmath46 are given by  @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 are temperature derivatives of the inverse correlation lengths , taken at @xmath33 .",

    "one initially obtains a sequence of exponent estimates via two - point fits of susceptibility data , and then proceeds to extrapolating such a sequence via three - point fits  @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization @xmath62 is difficult to calculate in a finite - size scaling context , because it is identically zero for a finite system . for quantum chains at @xmath63",
    "this problem can be overcome  @xcite , by exploiting the fact that there the largest eigenvalue of the tm gives the internal energy : in a first - order degenerate perturbation scheme , appropriate consideration of non - diagonal matrix elements enables one to extract the magnetization in the zero - field limit . for classical spins on strips ,",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue of the tm gives the free energy instead , and the perturbation - theory procedure used for quantum systems  @xcite can not be translated to our case .    in this work we estimated the finite - size magnetization exponent @xmath64 by calculating the average squared magnetization per column at @xmath44 , @xmath65 .",
    "considering , for example , a ferromagnet , denoting by @xmath66 the @xmath27 column basis states , and with @xmath67 , @xmath68 being respectively the dominant left and right eigenvectors of the tm , one has  @xcite : @xmath69 at the critical point , one should have : @xmath70 for a square - lattice antiferromagnet with only first - neighbor interactions , @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : magsq ] ) must be replaced by @xmath72 , so the staggered character of the order parameter is properly taken into account . the corresponding adaptation for the system of interest here",
    "is discussed in section  [ sec : nr ] below .",
    "we tested this procedure , with the appropriate ( uniform or staggered ) version of the magnetization , on the following square - lattice ising systems : ( i ) ferromagnet with nearest - neighbor couplings only ; ( ii ) ferromagnet with first- and second - neighbor interactions , @xmath12 ; and ( iii ) antiferromagnet with first- and second - neighbor interactions , @xmath21 ( for which the ordered state is nel - like  @xcite ) .",
    "in all three cases , @xmath44 is known either exactly or to a very good approximation , and the transition is in the ising universality class  @xcite , so @xmath4 . in order to gauge the likely systematic errors for our intended final application ( see section  [ sec : nr ] ) , we considered @xmath19 , and only even @xmath18 .",

    "these are in rather good agreement with the respective values @xmath244 and @xmath245 , quoted in ref .  .    near @xmath15 , the phase boundary has the expected parabolic shape  @xcite : @xmath246 where we found @xmath247 by fitting data corresponding to @xmath248 .    as noted previously in ref .   and above",
    ", we generally found finite - size effects to be much larger for the high - field ( @xmath249 ) part of the phase diagram .",

    "although alternative procedures to our _ ad hoc _ parabolic extrapolations against @xmath76 can certainly be devised , it must be noted that for this same field intensity the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : prg ] ) is @xmath253 already for @xmath151 , and decreases systematically with increasing @xmath18 .    at @xmath254 , the initial slope @xmath255 of the critical curve",
    "gives an estimate of the reduced critical chemical potential @xmath256 for the hard - square lattice gas with first- and second - neighbor exclusion , via @xmath257  @xcite .",
    "our result for the chemical potential is @xmath258 , to be compared with @xmath259  @xcite , and @xmath260  @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that our extrapolation procedures slightly underestimate the extent of the row - shifted @xmath5 phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta_cc ] shows our results for @xmath6 and @xmath1 along the extrapolated location of the collinear - paramagnetic border , parametrized by @xmath35 .",
    "these are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eta_prg ] ) and  ( [ eq : c ] ) , respectively . in part ( a ) , comparison between @xmath151 estimates and the final @xmath45 extrapolation illustrates that residual finite - size effects contribute towards overestimating the exponent @xmath6 , for all @xmath261 ( the approximate point where all finite-@xmath18 curves cross ) . on the other hand , for higher @xmath35 the finite - size corrections change sign .",
    "the extrapolated @xmath262 curve is to a large extent horizontal , near both the low- and high - temperature ends of the phase boundary .",
    "we estimate @xmath263 for @xmath264 , and @xmath265 for @xmath266 . in the intermediate region",
    "there is a crossover which becomes rather sharp around @xmath267 , at the upper end of the reentrant part of the phase diagram .",
    "the conformal - anomaly estimates in part ( b ) show the same behavior found for @xmath15 in section  [ sec : h=0 ] , and in ref .  , in that they are always slightly above unity . similarly to the @xmath15 case , we also found that , upon fitting free - energy data in the range @xmath268 $ ] , the estimates of @xmath1 always decrease upon increasing @xmath269 .",
    "thus , an interpretation of the present results as consistent with @xmath171 , albeit affected by strong crossover effects , seems credible .",
    "we evaluated critical magnetizations , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_comb ] ) , along the collinear - paramagnetic phase boundary .",
    "our calculations did not converge for @xmath270 , which approximately coincides with the reentrant region .",
    "thus , for the part of the critical boundary where we managed to produce estimates of @xmath64 , there is a one - to - one correspondence between field and temperature .",
    "our results are shown in figure  [ fig : beta ] , parametrized by @xmath32 .",
    "this way , it is easier to follow the evolution of quantities for low fields than if we used @xmath35 for the horizontal axis , because of the parabolic shape assumed by the critical curve in that region .",
    "one sees that the quality of fits generally deteriorates as @xmath32 increases ; the shallow dip around @xmath271 is possibly related to slight inaccuracies in the determination of the extrapolated critical line in that region .",
    "a more persistent trend is that towards increasing values for larger @xmath32 . we interpret this as signalling the onset of the physical effects which give rise to reentrant behavior for even larger fields",
    "indeed , a plausible explanation for the reentrance is , to quote ref .  , `",
    "the appearance of @xmath5 `` clusters '' that help to sustain the [ @xmath84collinear@xmath84 ] order at low temperatures even when the external field is slightly bigger than @xmath272 ' .",
    "this sort of cluster is not taken into account in our column - magnetization calculations , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_comb ] ) .",
    "we also know that the general effect of neglecting relevant contributions to the magnetization is to increase the apparent value of @xmath64 ; for instance , if @xmath144 is discarded in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_comb ] ) , the estimate of @xmath64 at @xmath273 , @xmath15 goes from @xmath274 to @xmath275 . according to this interpretation , for @xmath276 or thereabouts , @xmath5 configurations which are locally energetically favorable start contributing to ordering in the @xmath45 limit , but are not captured in the scheme of eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_comb ] ) . with decreasing @xmath35 and increasing @xmath32 ,",
    "the effect of such configurations becomes more relevant , providing a mechanism through which the apparent exponent increases , although the real one , we conjecture , possibly increases a little but stays slightly below @xmath277 .",
    "this would be in line with the behavior of @xmath6 , depicted in part ( a ) of figure  [ fig : eta_cc ] .",
    "calculation of the thermal exponent @xmath80 via eq .",
    "( [ eq : y_prg ] ) in the reentrant region gave negative values , an artifact already noticed in refs .",
    "however , evaluation of critical finite - size susceptibilities at @xmath278 gives @xmath61 in the range @xmath279 , depending on the details of corrections to scaling assumed for data fitting .",
    "although lacking in accuracy , this range of values is broadly consistent both with the corresponding @xmath6 estimate , and with the hypothesis that critical behavior obeys weak universality all along the collinear - paramagnetic critical line .",
    "turning now to the high - field part of the phase diagram , we illustrate in figure  [ fig : eta_hf ] our results for @xmath6 along the approximate critical lines , the latter obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : prg ] ) for @xmath233 .",
    "the curve for @xmath20 corresponds to that shown in figure 2 of ref .  .",
    "by comparing the evolution of @xmath6 along the approximate critical lines with the evolution of the lines themselves against increasing @xmath18 , shown in figure  [ fig : hfpd ] , one anticipates that calculating @xmath6 on the extrapolated phase boundary will give results very close to zero , or even slightly negative .",
    "indeed , this was what we found .",
    "it would appear that this is at least partly because our extrapolation procedures underestimate the extent of the row - shifted @xmath5 phase .",
    "evaluation of @xmath1 along the extrapolated critical line also gave physically inconsistent results .",
    "even though we are not able to produce numerically accurate estimates of @xmath6 for the high - field part of the phase diagram , the gist of the results shown in figure  [ fig : eta_hf ] is that this must be below @xmath280 , and possibly even zero .",
    "we return to this point in the next section .",
    "for the model described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : def ] ) , with @xmath12 , we have established a physical picture for the collinear - paramagnetic phase boundary , which is consistent with continuously - varying exponents along the critical line . together with various pieces of numerical evidence , collected at selected points , overall support for this is given by the conformal anomaly results depicted in part ( b ) of figure  [ fig : eta_cc ] .",
    "there is also clear evidence that such continuously - varying exponents satisfy , at least approximately , a weak - universality scenario  @xcite .",
    "however , as shown for the exponent @xmath6 in part ( a ) of figure  [ fig : eta_cc ] , our results indicate small but consistent deviations from the corresponding ising values .    furthermore , such deviations are internally consistent , in the sense that both @xmath6 and @xmath64 take on values lower than the ising ones , while @xmath61 is always found to be higher than the ising result . for @xmath64 ,",
    "the apparent reversal of this trend found for @xmath281 has been explained in section  [ sec : h>0 ] , as a likely effect of the same sort of locally stable @xmath5 configurations which , at lower @xmath35 and higher @xmath32 , become significant enough to induce reentrant behavior .    notwithstanding",
    "the compensation just referred to , our estimates of @xmath282 in general exceed @xmath94 , though never by more than @xmath283 times the respective ( combined ) error bar .",
    "however , it must be recalled that here @xmath61 is essentially one order of magnitude larger than @xmath6 , and both quantities have similar relative uncertainties , thus the calculated combined uncertainty is practically only that associated with @xmath61 . in such circumstances ,",
    "the apparent violation of a fundamental scaling relation reflects the fact that the relative uncertainty in @xmath61 was estimated as @xmath284 parts in @xmath285 .",
    "had this been doubled , all the basic conclusions from this work would still stand , and the mismatch would be essentially lost within the revised error bars .",
    "returning to @xmath6 as displayed in part ( a ) of figure  [ fig : eta_cc ] , the small but consistent shift between the high- and low-@xmath35 approximately constant values [ @xmath84respectively , @xmath286 and @xmath287 indicates a crossover between two distinct weak - universality classes .",
    "such small variations could probably be accounted for in the context of compactified boson theory  @xcite , in which continuously - varying critical indices are put in direct correspondence with the ( also continuously - varying ) radius @xmath288 associated with the underlying field theory .    in general , both for @xmath15 and @xmath17 ( the latter , along the collinear - paramagnetic critical line ) our results for the location of critical points , and exponents such as @xmath80 , @xmath61 , and @xmath64 , are mostly compatible , within error bars , with estimates available in the literature . on the other hand , for the row - shifted ( @xmath289-paramagnetic phase boundary at high fields , we have found a discrepancy of some @xmath290 between our estimate and that given in ref .",
    ", for the highest transition temperature at @xmath251 . even allowing for the ( rather plausible ) likelihood that our extrapolation procedures underestimate the extent of the ordered phase , for prg with the largest size available ( @xmath291 ) one has @xmath292 , already @xmath293 below @xmath294 quoted in ref .  . at this point",
    ", such discrepancy remains unexplained .",
    "we have not succeeded in gathering as much information regarding critical properties of the row - shifted ( @xmath289-paramagnetic boundary line , as we did for its collinear - paramagnetic counterpart .",
    "however , the behavior of @xmath6 illustrated in figure  [ fig : eta_hf ] reminds one of the low - temperature behavior of the two - dimensional @xmath7 model .",
    "indeed , with @xmath295 being the upper limit of the kosterliz - thouless critical phase , the exponent @xmath6 of the @xmath7 model grows smoothly and monotonically from @xmath296 at @xmath63 to @xmath297 at @xmath295 ( with most of the increase confined to higher @xmath35 : at @xmath298 , @xmath299 )  @xcite .",
    "so the very low values of @xmath6 found in the present case may , or may not , indicate the presence of incipient @xmath7-like behavior along at least part of the high - field critical line .",
