    "the accretion of gas through a disk , and ultimately on to a star or black hole , powers the intense luminosity of a great many astrophysical objects .",
    "the classical theory of disk accretion assumes that ( a ) correlated turbulent motions in the disk apply a torque that drives the observed transport , and that ( b ) the resulting radial - azimuthal component of the stress @xmath5 is proportional to the gas pressure @xmath2 , i.e.@xmath6 ( lynden - bell & pringle 1973 , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "this model permits the closure of the system of governing equations , allowing researchers to construct disk solutions with which to interpret observations .    at present",
    "the consensus is that the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) generates disk turbulence , at least in disks that are sufficiently ionised ( balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the mri in unstratified local domains certainly yield appropriate values for @xmath0 in cases where the computational domain is penetrated by a strong magnetic field ( hawley et al .",
    "1995 , simon et al .",
    "in contrast to the measurement of @xmath0 , however , there have been relatively few attempts to test whether @xmath5 is in fact proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "four studies exist : hawley et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereafter hgb95 ) , sano et al .",

    "( 2009 , shb09 ) and most recently minoshima et al .",
    "( 2015 , mhs15 ) which appeared when this paper was in draft form .",
    "all four were undertaken in unstratified shearing boxes , and show that @xmath5 depends on @xmath2 to a very weak power or not at all ( see also blackman et al .",
    "2008 ) . taken on face value ,",
    "these results imply that the mri saturates with little or no recourse to compressibility , and moreover cast doubt on the validity of the @xmath0-model , and the many structure and stability results that issue from it .    in this paper",
    ", we re - examine the relationship between the mri - induced turbulent stress and the gas pressure with numerical simulations in local unstratified boxes .",
    "we employ the codes ramses ( teyssier 2002 , fromang et al .",
    "2006 ) . in our main runs",
    "the gas is permitted to heat up , via turbulent dissipation , and we compare the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath2 during this phase .",
    "special care has been taken to minimise the influence of the box size on our results , and so we have set @xmath7 in most runs , where @xmath8 is the ` scale height ' ( the characteristic distance travelled by a sound wave over one orbit ) and @xmath9 is the vertical and radial box lengths .",
    "this is key . in the opposite regime , @xmath10 ,",
    "the turbulent eddies are always limited by the box ( a numerical effect ) and not by compressibility ( a physical effect ) . as a consequence , the relationship between mri saturation and compressibility is lost .",
    "note that the previous simulations of hgb95 , sits04 , shb09 , and mhs15 almost always use @xmath10 , and hence suffer from this shortcoming",
    ".    runs with @xmath11 , yield a @xmath5 that depends on @xmath2 in a stronger way than in earlier work .",
    "when there is no net magnetic flux and no explicit diffusion coefficients , we obtain @xmath12 with @xmath13 in both heating and cooling runs .",
    "in fact , the simulations indicate that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the grid length .",
    "this result shows that the stress is unconverged with respect to the numerical parameters  a pathology of this particular set - up ( see also fromang & papaloizou 2007 ) . a suite of isothermal simulations of differing box sizes and differing resolutions confirms this basic idea .",
    "the incorporation of physical diffusivities , however , elicits strikingly different behaviour : the stress and pressure are then almost proportional , with @xmath16 .",
    "on the other hand , both net - toroidal and net - vertical flux simulations yield @xmath17 . in these cases",
    "@xmath18 depends on the strength of the background magnetic field .",
    "the stronger the imposed flux , the weaker the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath2 .    despite these various complications",
    ", we have demonstrated that compressibility is important in the saturation of the mri .",
    "the exact form of the stress - pressure relationship , however , is difficult to extract from local simulations because of the issue of numerical convergence and the strength of any imposed flux .",
    "this makes local simulations of thermal stability particularly difficult to interpret .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next two sections we outline a very basic theoretical framework with which to interpret our results , and then give details of the numerical model and methods with which we attack the problem .",
    "our results appear in sections 4 and 5 , which treat zero - net - flux and net - flux configurations separately .",
    "we bring everything together in section 6 and discuss implications for the saturation of the mri and the possibility of thermal instability .",
    "in this section we restate the heuristic , and essentially hydrodynamical , arguments that justify the @xmath0-prescription .",
    "we then show how an insufficiently large box impinges on the stress s dependence on @xmath2 . finally , we speculate on how the presence of magnetic fields may change this picture .",
    "our initial assumption is that shear turbulence will act so as to eradicate the destabilising conditions from which it sprung . in other words",
    ", it will transport as much angular momentum outward as is possible .",
    "we next assume that the only restriction on the efficiency of this transport comes from the finite thickness of the disk and from compressibility : turbulent eddies can not be larger than @xmath8 , and turbulent speeds can not exceed the sound speed @xmath19 . if the motions were faster , enhanced dissipation from shocks would slow them till they were subsonic . in",
    "order to maximise transport , however , the turbulence will induce flows as close to @xmath19 as it can .",
    "note that we are assuming there is not a more stringent restriction , arising from a separate incompressible mechanism , that limits the turbulence to shorter scales .",
    "consequently , we may write @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the characteristic radial and azimuthal speeds of the largest eddies , and @xmath23 is their characteristic size . letting either @xmath24 or @xmath25 yields the alpha prescription , and we have @xmath26 , for some constant @xmath27 . in terms of the scale height , @xmath28",
    ".    an alternative argument uses dimensional analysis , a version of which we now briefly give .",
    "imagine a ` perfect ' shearing box simulation , perfect in the sense that its outcome is independent of the numerical domain size or the small scales .",
    "there are three relevant physical quantities , @xmath5 , @xmath19 , @xmath29 ( whose dependence on time is implicit ) , and two physical dimensions , mass density , and speed .",
    "there is hence only one way to relate these quantities , @xmath30 , and we arrive at the alpha model once again may be more complicated . ] .",
    "consider numerical simulations performed in unstratified boxes with a vertical and radial size of @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath31 , then the computational domain should play a negligible role , and the above argument will hold : @xmath32 . if , on the other hand , @xmath33 then the turbulent eddies will be limited not by @xmath8 but by @xmath9 . with @xmath34 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath35 , and the stress becomes a constant , independent of @xmath8 ( and hence @xmath2 ) .",
    "this could be considered the ` incompressible limit ' .",
    "when @xmath36 these two limits should smoothly join up , and in fig .",
    "1 we provide a sketch showing how this might look .",
    "the simulations of hgb95 , sits04 and shb09 allow the box to heat up due to turbulent dissipation .",
    "hence the scale height @xmath8 increases monotonically over time , reaching values , in some cases , many orders of magnitude greater than its starting value @xmath37 . in fig",
    ".  1 we may treat @xmath38 as a proxy for time , with the evolution of the stress following the blue curve to the right , rising with @xmath8 and then plateauing once the eddies hit the box size .",
    "importantly , @xmath39 in all the shb09 runs and in all but a handful of the sits04 and mhs15 runs .",
    "thus their simulations initial states fall mainly to the right of the red dot in fig .  1 .",
    "this means that the stress s evolution is strongly constrained by the box , capable of increasing marginally , if at all . as a consequence ,",
    "these studies are unable to truly test how strongly @xmath5 depends on @xmath2 .    to remove the artificial effect of the box size we must begin to the left of the red dot , ideally to the left of the red star .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to present runs with initial states as deep into this regime as possible .",
    "mri turbulence involves magnetic fields , obviously , which we expect to spoil this attractively simple picture . for starters , simulations without a net flux",
    "highlight the smallest scales over the largest . in the absence of physical diffusivities ,",
    "the characteristic eddy scale @xmath23 prefers to sit near the fixed grid scale @xmath15 , and as a result simulations return @xmath40 ( fromang & papaloizou 2007 , simon et al .",
    "this dependence of the stress on @xmath15 may partly wash out the dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "when physical diffusivities are incorporated the situation is not much improved : the ensuing turbulent dynamo depends on the magnetic prandtl number , and thus on the ( fixed ) small scales ( fromang et al .",
    "2007 , riols et al .  2013 , 2015 ) .",
    "having said that , large - scales are not completely irrelevant . in boxes of different aspect ratios",
    "the dynamo exhibits long term oscillations with coherent magnetic field reversals on the box size ( lesur & ogilvie 2008a , b ) .",
    "evidently , the dynamics are complicated and may involve interactions between multiple scales .",
    "certainly , the stress - pressure relationship could differ from the picture described in section 2.1 .    on the other hand , simulations involving a net flux witness the excitation of large - scale coherent motions , such as channel flows .",
    "our simple picture of transport via turbulent eddies may be complicated by these features , which periodically emerge from the turbulent melee and dominate the angular momentum transport ( hgb95 , inutsuka & sano 2001 , bodo et al .",
    "2008 , shb09 ) .",
    "compressibility fails to limit the development of channel flows , instead concentrating them into thin jets and current sheets ( latter et al .  2009 , lesaffre et al .",
    "if these flows dominate @xmath5 it is likely that the @xmath8 dependence explored above is muddled or completely lost .",
    "more generally , turbulent transport in mhd is dominated by an anisotropic tangle of flux linkages which take time to develop and also to destroy .",
    "how these magnetic structures respond as the pressure rises and falls is unclear , but appreciable time lags may build up between the variations in pressure and in magnetic transport , involving no doubt the efficiency of magnetic reconnection . as a consequence , the relationship between stress and pressure may not be a simple power law , but may include memory effects , for example ( cf .",
    "ogilvie 2003 , pessah et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "though not an mhd effect per se , but one that relates to time lags , is the issue of causation : is @xmath2 driving @xmath5 or vice versa ?",
    "section 2.1 argues that as pressure increases , the stress follows .",
    "but a variation in stress can also force a change in the temperature ( and hence pressure ) due to its associated variation in dissipation ( see arguments in hirose et al .",
    "though this interdependence is undoubtedly a complication , the timescales of the two processes differ and can be partly separated ; the stress s action on the pressure occurs on shorter timescales than the pressure s action on the stress ( latter & papaloizou 2012 ) .",
    "we have flagged quite a number of issues in this subsection , mainly for reference .",
    "in practice , not all directly impinge on our results . in what follows",
    "we explore primarily the significance of the small scales and the strength of any net flux .",
    "but before we show our results we present the details of our physical model and numerical set - up .",
    "in this paper we solve the equations of compressible mhd in the unstratified shearing box approximation ( goldreich and lynden - bell 1965 ) .",
    "it uses a local cartesian frame of reference which is corotating with a keplerian disk at some arbitrary radius , @xmath41 , with angular frequency @xmath42 . as is conventional , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45",
    "are taken to be the unit vectors in the radial , azimuthal and vertical directions respectively . in this frame of reference",
    ", the equations of motion can be written as    @xmath46    where @xmath29 is the mass density , @xmath47 is the velocity , @xmath2 is the gas pressure @xmath48 is the magnetic field , and @xmath49 is the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the ( molecular ) viscous stress is given by @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the shear viscosity .",
    "in most runs , @xmath52 .",
    "we adopt either an isothermal or an ideal gas equation of state . in the former @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fixed isothermal sound speed .",
    "otherwise , we must solve for the internal energy @xmath55 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the sum of the viscous heating and the resistive heating and @xmath58 is a cooling function .",
    "for an ideal gas @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the adiabatic index .",
    "we typically take @xmath61 . in non - isothermal runs ,",
    "the sound speed is then given by @xmath62 and the pressure scale height by @xmath63 .",
    "finally , when non - zero , the cooling law is usually @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are constants .",
    "some runs , however , set @xmath58 to be some fixed fraction of the dissipated energy .",
    "the set of equations just described are solved using ramses , a finite volume code based on the muscl - hancock algorithm ( teyssier 2002 ; fromang et al .",
    "our version of the code solves the shearing box equations on a uniform grid , and has been tested with an isothermal equation of state in fromang & stone ( 2009 ) , latter et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and fromang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .    instead of the total @xmath67-momentum equation",
    ", we evolve the equivalent conservation law for the angular momentum fluctuation @xmath68 , with @xmath69 the keplerian velocity .",
    "the azimuthal advection arising from @xmath69 is solved using an upwind solver . shearing box source terms in the momentum equation ( due to tidal gravity and coriolis forces ) are implemented following the crank - nicholson algorithm described in stone & gardiner ( 2010 ) .",

    ", its conservation law is written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the total pressure tensor @xmath73 the left hand side eq .",
    "is the usual energy conservation law , which we solve using the muscl - hancock algorithm .",
    "the treatment of the two terms on the right hand have been modified : the azimuthal advection of energy is solved with an upwind solver , and the second term involving the maxwell and reynolds stresses is added as a source term .",
    "several numerical tests of this implementation are presented in appendix  a. the simulations presented in this paper used the hlld riemann solver ( miyoshi & kusano 2005 ) , and the multidimensional slope limiter described in suresh ( 2000 ) .",
    "we adopt the same units as hgb95 , so that @xmath74 , the initial density is @xmath75 , and the initial sound speed @xmath76 in diabatic runs , or @xmath77 in isothermal runs .",
    "thus the initial scale height is @xmath78 , though often we retain the notation explicitly for clarity .",
    "note that , in contrast , @xmath8 is a function of @xmath2 and thus changes in thermally evolving simulations , increasing as the box heats up , and decreasing as it cools down .",
    "finally , we denote by @xmath79 the period of one orbit .    three initial configurations of magnetic field are considered : ( a ) zero net - flux , for which @xmath80 , ( b ) net - toroidal flux , @xmath81 , and ( c ) net - vertical flux , @xmath82 .",
    "we define a plasma beta in code units through @xmath83 , which we set to @xmath84 unless otherwise stated . to induce the mri",
    "we introduce random velocity perturbations in all principle directions with amplitudes @xmath85 .",
    "typically the radial and vertical sizes of the computational domain ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) are the same and denoted by @xmath9 , some multiple of @xmath37 .",
    "the azimuthal size is @xmath88 . unless otherwise stated , the resolution for the thermally evolving simulations is @xmath89 , and is the same in all directions .",
    "physical diffusion is neglected in all but a handful of zero - net - flux simulations for which @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "these values correspond to a magnetic prandtl number of @xmath92 , and reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers of @xmath93 and @xmath94 . these guarantee sustained turbulence and converged results ( fromang 2010 ) .",
    "the transport of angular momentum is dictated by the turbulent stress which is given by the sum of the reynolds and maxwell stresses @xmath95 it is the behaviour of this quantity as @xmath2 varies that we are most interested in . during diabatic simulations we calculate @xmath96 , where the angled brackets indicate an instantaneous box average and @xmath97 is the initial pressure . in isothermal simulations we are interested in the time and box averaged rate of angular momentum transport , which corresponds to the usual definition of the alpha parameter :",
    "@xmath98 the double angle brackets represent averages over both volume and time , the latter taken once we judge the system to have entered its saturated state .    in order to quantify the relationship between @xmath99 and @xmath2 we assume that @xmath100 for some number @xmath18 which we must determine . in heating runs , the pressure increases monotonically , while the stress increases for some period of time and then plateaus once the box size intervenes ( in accord with fig .  1 ) . by plotting the log of @xmath99 versus the log of @xmath2 during the growth phase",
    "we may obtain @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , the calculation of @xmath18 is not unambiguous .",
    "the stress is often bursty and the time of the growth phase relatively short .",
    "we hence can only give a rough estimate for @xmath18 .    finally , a useful diagnostic used by lesur and longaretti ( 2007 ) is the vertical correlation length .",
    "we define this correlation length by @xmath101 where the inner angled brackets represent an average over the @xmath102 direction and the outer angles brackets signify an average over 1 orbit .",
    "we cover the three possible topologies of the magnetic field in two separate sections , starting with zero - net flux .",
    "first we present our main results which display the effect of increased gas pressure on the stress , and how the box size and the diffusion scales impact on this behaviour .",
    "cooling runs are presented next , where a similar dependence is observed . finally , we look at isothermal simulations of differing sizes to see if these trends are reproduced in simulations that are in quasi - equilibrium .",
    "we place additional tests in appendix b that reinforce our results .",
    "we start off by considering boxes with no cooling ( @xmath103 ) and no explicit diffusion ( @xmath52 ) . the simulations , however , heat up by numerical dissipation which is captured by our total energy conserving scheme .",
    "we examine boxes with radial and vertical extents of @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , all with @xmath107 .",
    "the time histories of the pressure and stress of the @xmath108 simulation may be viewed in fig .",
    "[ fig::znf4st ] .",
    "while the pressure shows the monotonic increase expected , the stress s evolution is more complicated .",
    "first , it undergoes an exponential growth , corresponding to the onset of the linear instability , followed by a rapid decrease in stress as the initially ordered flow breaks down into turbulence .",
    "this phase only takes a handful of orbits . for the next 60 orbits , the stress exhibits significant growth , of almost a factor of 3 . during the same phase",
    ", the pressure has increased by a factor of about 5 . after 60 orbits",
    "the system enters a third phase : the pressure carries on growing but the stress plateaus and suffers large amplitude bursts ( in contrast to the more placid earlier stages ) . in summary ,",
    "the system , adheres rather closely to the expectations outlined in section 2.2 : after the linear phase , the box heats up , with the stress following behind , but once the turbulent eddy sizes hit the box size they can grow no more and the stress reaches a constant level .    in fig .",
    "[ zn4hstressvsp ] we plot the stress as a function of pressure , in order to estimate @xmath18 . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "this is not without ambiguity and we overplot lines of @xmath109 and @xmath110 to indicate possible ranges for this quantity . despite the uncertainty it is clear that , before the box size interferes , there is a relatively strong correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath99 .",

    "though the determination of @xmath18 is made difficult by the enhanced burstiness of the signal , the result is clear : the @xmath37 box is too small to adequately describe the growth of the stress .",
    "in addition , the fact that @xmath117 in both the @xmath105 and @xmath106 boxes suggests that @xmath18 has converged with respect to @xmath9 in the @xmath105 box .",
    "it must be emphasised that the result @xmath117 is still very much determined by the numerical parameters .",
    "on dimensional grounds ( cf .",
    "section 2.1 ) , any deviation from @xmath118 _ must _ arise from either a dependence on the box size , on the grid scale , or on both . in the previous subsection we investigated the influence of @xmath9 , in this subsection",
    "we investigate @xmath15 .",
    "fromang & papaloizou ( 2007 ) found that the stress is proportional to the grid scale @xmath15 in their isothermal simulations . suppressing the box size dependence for the moment",
    ", these results suggest the scaling @xmath119 in agreement with the @xmath117 we find . to reproduce this scaling in our heating runs we took the @xmath120 box and tried resolutions of @xmath121 , in addition to the fiducial @xmath122 . in all cases @xmath117 .",
    "in addition , during both the growth phase and the plateau phase , the magnitude of the stresses is proportional to @xmath15 , with the stress plateau taking values @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the three @xmath15s tried .    in summary",
    ", this sequence suggests that the stress scales as @xmath125 during the first stages of the simulation ( when the influence of the box size is mitigated ) .",
    "afterwards it scales as @xmath126 during the plateau stage , once @xmath8 grows sufficiently large .",
    "certainly , these results do not meet all the predictions of sections 2.1 and 2.2 .",
    "though @xmath18 increases in larger boxes , it does not approach the value 1 .",
    "moreover , the maximum stresses achieved are too small , proportional to @xmath9 not @xmath127 .",
    "obviously , the grid is obstructing the growth of the stress , preventing it from ( a ) fully responding to the pressure and ( b ) from obtaining larger values .",
    "as first shown by fromang & papaloizou ( 2007 ) , mri turbulence prefers to anchor itself on the grid scale , and this imposes a constraint comparable to that enforced by the acoustic radiation .",
    "in fact , if the fluid velocities follow @xmath19 but the turbulent lengthscales are stuck on the grid , so that @xmath128 , then we obtain the simulated result @xmath117 .    to test this idea we calculate the correlation length for the @xmath106 box and plot the outcome in fig .",
    "[ fig::znf4cor ] .",
    "if @xmath23 was stuck on the grid then the correlation length would stay constant with time .",

    "over 60 orbits this is some @xmath129 , after which @xmath130 plateaus . considering that the stress only grows by a factor 3 ,",
    "the increase in @xmath130 is not negligible and reveals that the correlation length is not entirely anchored to @xmath15 , though it can not wander too far away .    in conclusion",
    ", these results indicate that it may be impossible to obtain numerical convergence when determining the stress - pressure relationship in zero - flux simulations of this type .",
    "though the influence of the box size may be mitigated to some extent , the influence of the grid size is fundamental and can not be escaped .",

    "fromang ( 2010 ) found that , in isothermal runs , the stress is approximately independent of the reynolds number for @xmath134 when @xmath135 takes values between @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "in addition , the stress increases to larger values than earlier .",
    "physical diffusion elicits dramatically different behaviour vis - a - vis the numerical grid .",
    "it would appear that the former does not constrain the turbulent eddies nearly so forcefully , leading to a stress that can grow more freely .",
    "[ fig::znf4cor ] the correlation length is plotted , which further illustrates the contrast between the two cases .",
    "the reason for why @xmath18 is not exactly 1 may be due to the residual influence of the box , or possibly the influence of the reynolds numbers .",
    "the fact that the viscous scales are only marginally resolved could also play a role .",

    "the reason seems to be that the plateau phase starts before @xmath8 reaches the box size , such that @xmath8 increases by a factor only @xmath142 during the growth phase of the stress , and not the anticipated factor 4 ( fig .",

    "the measured @xmath18 is little different to the smaller box with the maximum horizontal correlation length @xmath182 .",

    ", one could explore the connection between @xmath18 and @xmath167 . but",
    "decreasing @xmath167 further leads to more prominent channel activity because the system is closer to criticality ; these bursts complicate the heating and stress behaviour and hence the extraction of a reliable @xmath18 .",

    "we leave open the question of the @xmath167 dependence of @xmath18 to future work , but expect similar outcomes to section 5.1 .",
    "the main aim of our paper is to highlight the importance of box size in the relationship between mri - induced stress and pressure . in most previous simulations the pressure scale height @xmath8 was greater than the vertical size of the computational domain @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , turbulent eddies were not restricted by the compressibility effects assumed by the alpha model , and so the associated stresses were unable to manifest a meaningful dependence on pressure .    in order to bring out the true relationship between @xmath99 and @xmath2 we present simulations in the opposite regime , when @xmath7 .",
    "generally , we find a stronger dependence , and in zero - net flux simulations with explicit diffusivities we almost reproduce @xmath203 , as required by the @xmath0-disk model . the same simulations without explicit diffusivities , however , can not escape the influence of the grid and remain unconverged with respect to the numerical parameters .",
    "toroidal - net - flux simulations witness a weakening of the stress - pressure relationship once the imposed magnetic field gets too large .",
    "it is possible that this is to do with enhanced magnetic tension , and consequently a greater proximity of the mri to criticality , though how this works out physically is unclear .",
    "weaker fields in both net - toroidal and vertical runs ( @xmath204 ) roughly suggest the scaling @xmath205 , which is consistent with ggsj09 , though its origin is also mysterious and the role of numerical factors is still to be fully determined .    our results present various puzzles and problems that future simulations should pursue .",
    "further work is required to understand the zero - net - flux simulations with explicit diffusivities .",
    "in particular , why does the growth in @xmath99 halt ` prematurely ' ? simulations in large boxes and different reynolds numbers may help probe this behaviour . other angles to take include potential prandtl number or box aspect ratio dependencies .",
    "our toroidal flux simulations omit explicit diffusivities but it would be beneficial to see what changes occur , especially in @xmath18 , when they are present . in the strong field , low @xmath167 , regime the adjustment should be marginal . for weaker fields ,",
    "when the alfvn length is small , we anticipate more noticeable discrepancies .",
    "the @xmath18-@xmath167 connection in vertical - flux simulations could also be explored more fully .",
    "finally , it would be beneficial to extend our isothermal simulations .",
    "of most interest would be zero - flux runs with explicit diffusion , and toroidal - flux runs exploring different @xmath167 .",
    "an obvious generalisation of this work would be to include vertical stratification .",
    "unstratified boxes can cleanly test the most fundamental idea of the alpha model : that acoustic radiation limits the development of disk turbulence . however , when @xmath155 , the vertical structure of the disk should really be included .",
    "pressure controls the disk thickness and this geometric effect ( omitted in unstratified boxes ) presents a second way that pressure may influence @xmath99 .",
    "future work in this direction is challenging . in zero - net - flux simulations it may be difficult to escape the influence of the grid , due to resolution constraints .",
    "net - vertical flux simulations , on the other hand , may be complicated by the emergence of outflows ( fromang et al .",
    "2013 , bai & stone 2013 , lesur et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "we finish with a short discussion on thermal instability in accretion disks , the main impetus for this work .",
    "essentially , thermal instability must rely on the competing dependencies of the heating and cooling on temperature . to establish stability or instability",
    "we then must have knowledge of how @xmath99 depends on pressure .",
    "the classical instability of radiation - pressure dominated accretion flows assumes that the stress is proportional to total pressure ( lightman & eardley 1974 , shakura & sunyaev 1976 , piran 1978 ) .",
    "of course , radiation pressure is omitted in our simulations , but a useful first step is to establish how @xmath99 depends on gas pressure alone and to highlight constraints on the stress s evolution .",
    "this may then aid in the interpretation of more advanced simulations , especially as they appear to produce contradictory stability behaviour ( hirose et al .",
    "2009 , jiang & stone 2013 ) .",
    "in particular , divergent results are obtained in boxes of different @xmath86 .",
    "a natural question is : does the stability s box - size dependence issue from the kind of variable stress - pressure relationship explored in our paper ?",
    "another question is : how captive are these stability results to the numerical parameters , in particular the grid scale @xmath15 ?",
    "as shown in zero - net - flux runs , the stress is propotional to @xmath15 hence weakening its dependence on @xmath2 and denying it numerical convergence . in the light of that ,",
    "how are we to interpret these simulations and then apply them to real systems ?",

    "we test initial conditions and confirm that our choice of resolution is adequate when using explicit diffusion coefficients .      in section 4",
    "we consider zero - net - flux systems that are out of equilibrium and evolving with time .",
    "the phenomena that we are primarily interested in occur relatively early in the simulations and so the initial conditions may not have been completely forgotten and may be influencing our results .",
    "we check how robust they are to the choice of initial condition . instead of small amplitude noise",
    "we use as an initial condition a turbulent quasi - equilibrium . to generate this quasi - equilibrium we used the same computational set - up as the fiducial @xmath115 zero - net - flux simulation but we introduce a cooling law @xmath232 into the energy equation .",
    "this prescription ensured a stable non - zero thermal equilibrium point from which we could restart the simulation with out any cooling .",

    "it is necessary to check that the grid is sufficient small to ensure negligible numerical diffusion and dissipation .",
    "our approach was to consider the contributions to the volume averaged internal energy @xmath236 .",
    "the rate of change in @xmath236 can be written as @xmath237 where @xmath238 and @xmath239 are the volume averaged contributions from physical and numerical dissipations respectively .    for our choice of parameters to be appropriate",
    "we must have @xmath240 .",
    "we compute these quantities for a @xmath131 zero net - flux box with the above choice of parameters .",

    "this shows that the total time averaged numerical diffusion is significantly less than the total physical dissipation but roughly equal to the ( subdominant ) viscous dissipation .    to further check that a resolution of @xmath235 gives appropriate results for our chosen @xmath135 and @xmath241",
