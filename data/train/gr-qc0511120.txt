    "the two most successful physical theories of the twentieth century were quantum mechanics , culminating in quantum field theory and the standard model of particles and interactions , and general relativity , einstein s geometric theory of gravitation .",
    "these two theories , refined and verified to extraordinary accuracy , are beautiful mathematical descriptions of the physical universe .",
    "the fact that they have been found fundamentally incompatible stands as the greatest failure of twentieth century science , and provides the greatest challenge at the dawn of the twenty - first century .",
    "many attempts have been made to unify these two theories .",
    "the most popular current approaches , based on string theory , extend the methods and applications of qft to various scenarios in a mathematically consistent but somewhat convoluted manner only tenuously connected to the standard model and gr .",
    "although it is possible further development of string theory will lead to a coherent picture  and the development of beautiful mathematics is certainly , itself , a noble pursuit ",
    "several decades of intensive research have failed to produce a single successful experimental prediction .",
    "the one solid prediction of string theory , the existence of super - particle partners to the existing standard model particles , has so far failed to materialize .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to take a step backwards , reconsider the fundamental elements of gr and the standard model , and consider other approaches to unification following a more conservative path .",
    "the fundamental fields of the standard model are gauge fields , spinors , and scalars over four dimensional spacetime .",
    "these elements have mathematical descriptions , respectively , as fiber bundle connections , clifford algebra elements with anti - commuting components , and higgs fields .",
    "qft calculations arising from the standard model also require the introduction of brst `` ghost '' fields to properly account for gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "general relativity , in contrast , is about the geometry of spacetime itself  using a metric as well as a spin connection .",
    "but the spinor field lagrangian of the standard model requires that the metric be alternatively described by a vierbein field , also known as a frame or tetrad , as a fundamental field .",
    "any unified description of nature must employ all of these elements .",
    "also , since the naive application of qft methods to linearized gr fail , qft must be generalized for a unification program to succeed .",
    "a necessary question is how to extend qft so it works for quantizing gr as well as reproducing existing methods . the best current attack on this problem is loop quantum gravity @xcite and similar approaches .",
    "the main modification to qft suggested by lqg is that quantum transition amplitudes should not be considered between field observables at different spacetime points , but rather between boundary surfaces , with boundary surface states described by spin networks .",
    "this and other approaches to quantum gravity use a connection as the fundamental field of gr . some very interesting recent work @xcite revives an idea by macdowell and mansouri that the @xmath0 spin connection may be broken into a @xmath1 connection and vierbein , with the action for gr given by a restricted bf action .",
    "this restricted bf action may then be submitted to the methods of qft , with a perturbative expansion about the purely topological bf action .",
    "lqg and related programs of conservatively generalizing qft to accommodate gravity seem , from an outsider s viewpoint , the most likely to succeed . in effect",
    ", they constitute the first step in a program of unification launched from the gr side rather than the particle theory side  the final goal being to extend the geometric description of general relativity to encompass qft and the standard model .",
    "the purpose of this article is to sketch how this unification may happen at the level of the fundamental fields , as simply as possible . in sum , the frame and spin connection 1-forms of gr may be unified in a clifford algebra valued connection on a bundle , @xmath2 , as in the mm method .",
    "this connection may then be incorporated in a larger clifford fiber with the gauge and higgs fields of the standard model , @xmath3 . in previous work ,",
    "it was shown that anti - commuting clifford fields arise naturally from the brst method , and the standard model fermion multiplets may be placed in a brst extended connection , @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting brst extended curvature may then be used in a restricted bf lagrangian , giving the standard model plus gravity from a brst extended , clifford algebra valued connection .",
    "each step of this construction , building up to the full standard model plus gravity , will be described in detail using basic differential geometry so the reader may readily skim , reproduce , or absorb the material .",
    "an `` @xmath5 dimensional '' clifford algebra fiber , @xmath6 , is a @xmath7 dimensional graded lie algebra built from @xmath8 basis vector generators , @xmath9 , satisfying@xmath10 with @xmath11 the generalized diagonal minkowski metric having @xmath12 positive and @xmath13 negative entries .",

    "the above identities imply that the sub - algebra of anti - symmetric products of bivectors of an @xmath5 dimensional clifford algebra , @xmath30 , is equivalent to the algebra of anti - symmetric products of vector and bivector elements of an @xmath31 dimensional clifford algebra .",
    "this sub - algebra of vectors and bivectors is nearly , but not , equivalent to the poincare algebra of corresponding dimension . also , the even graded sub - algebra of an @xmath5 dimensional clifford algebra is equal to an @xmath31 dimensional clifford algebra .",
    "the fundamental clifford identity ( [ eq : eta ] ) , and thus the clifford algebra itself , is invariant under the clifford group adjoint operation,@xmath32 in which , for infinitesimal transformations , @xmath33 for some `` small '' multivector @xmath34 .",
    "this operation gives the form of the transition functions acting on fiber basis elements over the base manifold .",
    "of special algebraic interest is the clifford pseudo - scalar , @xmath35 , which squares to@xmath36 implying @xmath37 for dimension @xmath38 .",
    "multiplication by @xmath39 acts as the clifford duality transformation , taking a clifford @xmath27-vector to its `` clifford dual '' @xmath40-vector,@xmath41 in which @xmath42 are the @xmath40-vector basis elements with indices raised by @xmath43 and@xmath44}^{n-1}=\\left\\langle \\gamma_{\\alpha\\ldots\\delta}\\gamma^{-1}\\right\\rangle\\ ] ] is the anti - symmetric permutation symbol .",
    "the pseudo - scalar always commutes with even graded elements , @xmath45 , and anti - commutes with odd graded elements only in even dimensions , @xmath46 .",
    "so for even @xmath5 we have @xmath47 .",
    "the covariant derivative acting on basis elements , consistent with the transition functions , encodes how the basis vectors change as we move around on the base manifold,@xmath48 and does not necessarily preserve the grade of the basis elements when @xmath49 is a clifford valued connection 1-form of arbitrary grade .",
    "this implies that for any section , @xmath34 ( a clifford valued field over the base manifold ) , its covariant derivative is    @xmath50 with @xmath51 the exterior derivative operator .",
    "the spin connection of general relativity , @xmath52 , is a bivector valued 1-form , encoding how the basis vectors rotate as we move around  it does preserve the grade of the basis elements .",
    "for example , an observer moving along a path @xmath53 parameterized by @xmath54 with velocity @xmath55 would have the basis vectors changing over them by@xmath56 in which the vector - form contraction rule employed above is traditionally written less compactly as @xmath57 .",
    "it is pedagogically useful to mark all tangent bundle vectors and forms with accents indicating their grade so as to better identify their nature and commutative properties .",
    "if there is a section of the bundle , a field @xmath58 , an observer moving along a path would see this field change over them as a function of @xmath54 to @xmath59 .",
    "a section is said to be parallel transported by the spin connection over their path iff@xmath60 evaluated along the path .",
    "since the section and its derivatives are only evaluated along the path , this extends to describe a fiber element defined only over the path , @xmath61 , that is said to be parallel transported if it satisfies the same equation .",
    "the frame , a clifford vector valued 1-form,@xmath62 encodes a metric on a base manifold of dimension @xmath5 through contraction with vectors,@xmath63 and has an inverse , @xmath64 , such that@xmath65    it turns out to be remarkably fruitful to consider the frame and spin connection together in a clifford connection,@xmath66 of mixed grade 1 and 2 .",
    "although this is algebraicly equivalent to a bivector connection in one higher dimension , it seems natural to consider this combined connection in @xmath67 over a four dimensional base manifold .",
    "the geometry of a fiber bundle is described by the curvature of its connection .",
    "just as the connection arises as the description of how sections change over the paths of observers traveling on the base , the curvature continues this description to second order in path length and determines how fiber elements change when parallel transported around small loops .",
    "any clifford multivector , @xmath34 , is parallel transported along a parameterized curve , @xmath53 , with velocity @xmath68 iff@xmath69 for a specified clifford connection .",
    "parallel transport transforms the multivector via a path dependent clifford valued adjoint operator , @xmath70 , as it moves along the curve,@xmath71 with initial condition @xmath72 .",
    "this parallel transport operator is independent of @xmath34 and , from ( [ eq : ctransp ] ) , must satisfy the parallel transport equation:@xmath73 for small distances along a path , @xmath74 , this operator may be approximated to arbitrary order . to first order@xmath75 and to second order@xmath76\\left[1-\\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon^{k}\\omega_{k}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\   & \\simeq1-\\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon^{i}\\omega_{i}+\\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon^{ij}\\left[-\\partial_{j}\\omega_{i}+\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{i}\\omega_{j}\\right]\\label{eq : u2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the second order path dependence above defined as@xmath77 continuing the series suggests the formal expression@xmath78    the curvature is a geometric object determining the approximate change in any multivector parallel transported around a small loop .",
    "a loop may be specified by choosing two orthonormal vectors , @xmath79 and @xmath68 , at a point @xmath80 and making a square - ish path by going @xmath81 in the @xmath79 direction , then @xmath81 along @xmath68 , @xmath81 along @xmath82 , then @xmath81 along @xmath83 back to @xmath80 .",
    "these four parameterized path segments are given by@xmath84 and produce an anti - symmetric path dependence,@xmath85 implying the loop is described by a tangent 2-vector,@xmath86 from ( [ eq : u2 ] ) , the operator for parallel transport completely around a small loop is approximately,@xmath87=1+\\frac{1}{4}l^{ij}\\left[\\partial_{i}\\omega_{j}-\\partial_{j}\\omega_{i}+\\omega_{i}\\times\\omega_{j}\\right]=1+\\frac{1}{4}l^{ij}f_{ij}=1-\\frac{1}{2}{\\accentset{\\rightharpoonup}{{\\accentset{\\rightharpoonup}{l}}}}{\\underaccent{\\rightharpoondown}{{\\underaccent{\\rightharpoondown}{f}}}}\\ ] ] with the clifford valued curvature 2-form coefficients here emerging as@xmath88 and the index free clifford valued curvature 2-form written as@xmath89 the wedge product between forms is not written since forms always wedge , and the cross product occurs only between clifford basis elements .",
    "any clifford element , @xmath34 , parallel transported around a small loop is changed to@xmath90 to first order in loop area .    for a bivector valued spin connection , the bivector valued riemann curvature 2-form is@xmath91",
    "for which , in components,@xmath92 the writing of the cross between the product of any two identical 1-forms is redundant , @xmath93 , since basis 1-forms anti - commute .",
    "the clifford curvature of a combined vector and bivector connection ( [ eq : omega ] ) naturally splits into clifford vector and bivector graded parts,@xmath94 identifiable as the torsion vector valued 2-form , the riemann curvature bivector , and the bivector area 2-form .",
    "the curvature may also be obtained by twice applying the covariant derivative,@xmath95      over a four dimensional base manifold a restricted bf action equivalent to that of general relativity may be written with clifford @xmath67 as@xmath96 employing the clifford pseudo - scalar , @xmath97 , a new vector and bivector valued 2-form variable , @xmath98 , and using an under - bar to designate forms of large or arbitrary grade . since clifford basis orthogonality implies the scalar part of two multiplied clifford elements splits into terms of multiplied equal graded parts , this lagrangian splits into@xmath99 varying the action with respect to @xmath98 , the vector part , @xmath100 , is a lagrange multiplier enforcing zero torsion , @xmath101 , and the bivector part gives the equation@xmath102 in which @xmath103 is the bivector part of the curvature . plugging this back in",
    "gives the lagrangian purely in terms of the curvature,@xmath104 since the clifford pseudo - scalar commutes with even graded clifford elements , basis 1-forms anti - commute , and the exterior derivative is nilpotent , the riemann squared term in ( [ eq : ffg ] ) is a chern - simons boundary term,@xmath105 so the lagrangian is equivalent , up to this boundary term , to the lagrangian for einstein - cartan gravity including a cosmological constant term,@xmath106 in which @xmath107 is the volume 4-form and @xmath108 is the curvature scalar .",
    "the appearance of the cosmological constant is made explicit by the appropriate vierbein scaling ",
    "rescaling @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "the equivalence of terms written in clifford valued form notation to those written in components is seen by expanding in basis elements and employing the orthogonality rules .",
    "although the methods and action described so far are equivalent to those of macdowell - mansouri and others , the formulation here allows the action to be written naturally in terms of the clifford dual and does not require symmetry breaking to step down from @xmath0 . also , the clifford algebra approach easily generalizes to additional interesting systems , such as clifford algebras and sub - algebras of different signatures and dimensions . as in the mm approach ,",
    "the main observation is that the dynamics of gr may be described purely in terms of a connection , without needing a metric on the base manifold .",
    "viewed in this light , the scale of the vierbein should properly be interpreted as a higgs field  an idea that will pop up again later .",
    "the first equation of motion is the vanishing of the torsion,@xmath111 which , for @xmath67 , may be solved explicitly for the spin connection in terms of the exterior derivative and inverse of the vierbein,@xmath112    varying the action ( [ eq : oaction ] ) with respect to @xmath49 gives@xmath113 and hence the second equation of motion,@xmath114 which includes the odd and even graded parts,@xmath115 incorporating the first equation of motion ( [ eq : beom ] ) and the `` second '' bianchi identity,@xmath116 these become@xmath117 using the vanishing torsion , the last equation becomes @xmath118 and the only remaining equation is@xmath119 einstein s equation , where @xmath120 has been used , presuming even @xmath5 .",
    "the equations of motion may alternatively be obtained by varying @xmath49 in ( [ eq : ffg ] ) to get@xmath121 combining with the clifford bianchi identity , @xmath122 , and breaking into graded parts gives vanishing torsion , einstein s equation , and the `` first '' bianchi identity , @xmath123 .      under a gauge transformation ( [ eq : adj ] ) , parameterized by clifford element @xmath124 , the connection transforms to@xmath125 which may be written as@xmath126 and the curvature transforms to@xmath127 giving @xmath128 .",

'' an equation that holds only when the equations of motion are enforced is said to be true `` on shell , '' and one that holds even when they are not enforced is true `` off shell .

    "one alternative is to interpret @xmath360 as the connection for a cartan geometry with lie group @xmath361  with a lie subgroup , @xmath362 , formed by the generators of elements other than @xmath109 , and the spacetime `` base '' formed by @xmath363 .",
    "another particularly appealing interpretation is the kaluza - klein construction , with four compact dimensions implied by the higgs vector , @xmath364 , and a corresponding translation of the components of @xmath360 into parts of a vielbein including this higher dimensional space .",
    "the model may also be extended to encompass more traditional unification schemes , such as using a ten dimensional clifford algebra in a @xmath365 gut .",
    "all of these geometric ideas should be developed further in the context of the model described here , as they may provide valuable insights .    in conclusion , and in defense of its existence , this work has concentrated on producing a clear and coherent unified picture rather than introducing novel ideas in particular areas .",
    "the answer to the question of what here is really `` new '' is : `` as little as possible . ''",
