    "the third possible approach is to utilize some ultraviolet ( uv ) finite quantity .",

    "@xcite , on the other hand , a local product of gauge fields for a positive flow time can be expanded by renormalized local operators of the original gauge theory with finite coefficients .",
    "those coefficients satisfy certain renormalization group equations that , combined with the dimensional analysis , provide information on the coefficients as a function of the flow time . because of the asymptotic freedom",
