    "phase transitions in interacting electron systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium are an exciting , relatively young field of research , both for fundamental theoretical reasons and for application purposes .",
    "while the theory of equilibrium phase transitions is well developed , a theory for phase transitions out of equilibrium is much more difficult to formulate , largely because in the most general case the thermodynamic states of the system are not characterized by a minimum of the free energy and because often the temperature @xmath0 as a state variable driving the transition is not even defined . on the other hand , nonequilibrium phase transitions are of high technological potential , since a mesoscopic electron system can be driven out of equilibrium in a highly controlled way , and controlling a nonequilibrium phase transition by externally applied fields can be envisaged .",
    "it opens up the prospect of fast switching between different magnetic or conducting states of a mesoscopic system , e.g. by applying a transport bias voltage or by an applied laser field , with possible spintronics applications .",
    "a thermodynamic phase transition _ in equilibrium _ is in general controlled by the minimum of the free energy @xmath2 i.e. by the balance of the internal energy @xmath3 and the entropy @xmath4 .",
    "the dependence on the control parameter temperature favors an ordered phase at low @xmath0 and a disordered phase at high @xmath0 . in a _",
    "stationary nonequilibrium situation _ internal energy and entropy are statistically still well - defined quantities .",
    "one may , therefore , conjecture that a relation analogous to eq .",
    "[ eq : f ] holds even in this case .",
    "the different phases of a stationary non - equilibrium system would then again be determined by the minimum of the free energy . however , in the above relation ( [ eq : f ] ) the entropy coefficient @xmath0 would have to be generalized , since temperature @xmath0 is in general not defined in nonequilibrium . based on general thermodynamic arguments we propose in the present article a definition of such a generalized control parameter @xmath5 which allows to describe electron systems driven out of equilibrium by an applied stationary bias voltage @xmath1 in a unified way .    to be specific",
    ", we consider the voltage - driven magnetic phase transition of a stoner ferromagnet .",
    "such a system can be realized as a mesoscopic sample of a magnetic metal , contacted by two paramagnetic electron reservoirs or leads at chemical potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated that the fabrication of such devices , which sustain a high nonequilibrium bias , is technologically feasible using metallic nanobridges with high lead - to - bridge aspect ratio @xcite or using resistive nanowires.@xcite as will be seen below , the ferromagnetic transition in the mesoscopic sample can be controlled both by the reservoir temperature @xmath0 and by the voltage @xmath8 applied between the reservoirs .",
    "the magnetic state of the sample may be probed by a third , ferromagnetic electrode , attached to the sample via a tunnel junction .",
    "this electrode stays in equilibrium with itself , independent of the transport voltage @xmath1 , so that it remains in the ferromagnetically ordered state throughout the transition of the sample , and its tunneling conductance depends strongly on the magnetization in the sample . a related proposal of controlling magnetism by a nonequilibrium transport bias",
    "has recently been put forward in ref .",
    "however , in that proposal the magnetization was induced in a paramagnetic metal sample by ferromagnetism in the leads , and the sample was assumed to be zero - dimensional in the sense that it was smaller than the electrons elastic mean free path @xmath9 , implying ballistic transport and a position independent electron distribution function in the metal sample . in the present work we consider the more realistic case of a resistive , ferromagnetic sample whose lateral size @xmath10 is greater than the elastic mean free path , @xmath11 , but still smaller than the inelastic and spin relaxation lengths , @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the transport is diffusive , leading to a nonequilibrium electron distribution function which depends on the location along the sample .",
    "we develop a mean field theory for the temperature- or voltage - driven stoner transition .",
    "one might think that this transition , driven by the transport voltage at reservoir temperature @xmath13 might be a quantum phase transition , since it is controlled by a parameter different from the temperature .",
    "however , at any finite voltage @xmath14 the nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution is such that there exists a finite phase space for inelastic scattering ( see , e.g. , section 2.1 ) , so that the quantum dephasing rate in the sample , @xmath15 , remains finite even for reservoir temperature @xmath13 .",
    "thus , critical divergencies of correlation functions at the phase transition are dominated by classical , statistical fluctuations rather than quantum fluctuations , i.e. the transition belongs to the universality class of classical rather than quantum phase transitions , in contrast to the assertion of ref .  [ 4 ] .",
    "remarkably , the authors of ref .  [ 4 ] do , however , find that the transition is governed by the classical critical exponents .",
    "in fact , as will be seen in section 3 , the roles of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are completely analogous , as far as thermodynamic properties are concerned .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we define the stoner model in a steady - state nonequilibrium situation with finite bias .",
    "the quantum boltzmann equation for a resistive wire with a stoner mean - field interaction is derived in section 2.1 , and the stoner mean - field equations in the presence of finite bias are presented in section 2.2 , along with their numerical solution for various temperatures and voltages . in section 3",
    "we provide general thermodynamic arguments which allow us to introduce a control parameter @xmath16 , depending on the reservoir temperature @xmath0 and the bias voltage @xmath1 , as a generalization of the temperature to the voltage - biased non - equilibrium situation , as far as thermodynamic properties are concerned .",
    "we demonstrate explicitly that this provides a universal description of the voltage - driven stoner transition .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section 4 .",

    "we assume that any antiferromagnetic instabilities that could be induced by nearest neighbor hopping on a cubic lattice are frustrated , e.g. , by an appropriate lattice structure or by a next - nearest neighbor hopping included in the band structure @xmath19 .",

    "if inelastic relaxations can be neglected , @xmath28 is known @xcite to have a double - step form according to the two fermi edges in the reservoirs , and to depend linearly on the position @xmath30 along the sample axis ( see fig .  [ fig1]a ) ) . in a ferromagnet , however , the stoner splitting may in general depend on @xmath31 as well , inducing nontrivial position and spin dependences to @xmath28 even in the absence of inelastic or dynamical spin flip processes . in the following",
    "we derive the distribution function for the case of a mesoscopic ferromagnet , where ineleastic and spin flip processes can be neglected .",

    "@xmath41 is the electron group velocity and @xmath42 the force acting on the electrons due to an external field @xmath43 .",
    "the latter includes both , the external bias voltage and the electrostatic potential generated by the random impurities . since we consider a stationary situation and assume that the sample is smaller than the inelastic and the spin relaxation lengths , the explicit time derivative and the collision integral @xmath44 vanish in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) . after summation over @xmath25 the force term vanishes as well .",
    "this is because of the relation @xmath45 here the second term implies an integration over the surface of the 1st brillouin zone , where @xmath46 is either 0 or 1 , i.e. @xmath47 and @xmath48 . the same @xmath25-summation also introduces the particle and the current density in eq .",

    "this will be done in a forthcoming publication.@xcite in the present paper we wish to focus on universality related issues , which can be discussed as well for the particle - hole symmetric case .",
    "therefore , we will assume in the following that the dos is flat within the energy window defined by the applied bias voltage @xmath1 .",

    "this suggests that it should be possible to define a single , unified state variable , involving both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in terms of the internal energy .",

    "remarkably , @xmath107 does not depend on the position @xmath31 where the energy density is considered , as long as the dos is flat , in accordance with the results of section 2.2 .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : deltau ] ) can now be used to extract a generalized state variable , @xmath108 , that uniquely determines the internal energy of the reference system , and thus the thermodynamics of any stationary electron system controlled by the state variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the lorentz number , and @xmath111 .",
    "note that the form of the expression for @xmath108 is equivalent to the effective temperature of a voltage - biased , hot electron system that has equilibrated due to strong inelastic processes.@xcite however , in our line of arguments above no assumption has been made about whether or not there are inelastic processes involved .",
    "this supports the universality of the definition eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "we have tested whether the stoner transition can be described by @xmath108 in a universal way . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have plotted all the data contained in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] as a function of @xmath108 .",
    "indeed there is a perfect collapse of all data onto a single curve , as expected .",
    "even the simple stoner model of a ferromagnetic transition can exhibit interesting behavior when considered in a non - equilibrium situation .",
    "we have used this model to define a generalized control parameter @xmath16 which allows to describe the voltage and temperature dependence of the stoner transition in a unified way .",
    "the model has been evaluated within mean - field theory where the critical exponent of the magnetization in dependence of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath112 .",
    "we emphasize that the generality of our thermodynamic arguments that led to the definition of @xmath113 strongly suggest that it not only allows for a universal description of the magnetization but also of the complete thermodynamics of the stoner model , and that this holds true even beyond mean field theory .",
    "in particular , correlations will certainly change the value of @xmath114 , but it will remain the same for the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 dependence . moreover , the thermodynamic arguments suggest that not only stoner ferromagnets but the thermodynamics of any interacting electron system controlled by the reservoir temperature @xmath0 and a nonequilibrium transport voltage @xmath1 can be described by @xmath16 in a universal way .",
    "conversely , it is obvious that dynamical and spectral properties are influenced by @xmath0 and @xmath1 in quite different ways , which can not be captured only by the @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependence of the internal energy .",
    "therefore , no unified behavior is expected for these quantities .",
    "as mentioned above , the magnetization @xmath98 will acquire an @xmath31-dependence , as soon as the density of states in the sample as function of energy is not flat . in this case the interaction - induced correlation length will also influence the spatial dependence of @xmath98 .",
    "the thermodynamics of voltage - driven systems , the influence of correlations in general and the position dependence of the magnetization in particular will be subjects of further research .",
