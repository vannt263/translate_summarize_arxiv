    "multiferroic materials , in which ferromagnetic , ferroelectric , and/or ferroelastic orderings coexist , have attracted significant research interest since many years @xcite due to their potential applications in data storage media , spintronics and ferroelectric random - access memories .",
    "the co - existence of ferro-orders in multiferroics allows the possibility that the magnetization can be tuned by an applied electric field and vice versa . among the limited choices offered by the multiferroic materials , bifeo@xmath4 ( bfo ) , one of the single - phase multiferroic materials at room temperature , exhibits the co - existence of ferroelectric ordering with curie temperature ( t@xmath8 ) of 1123 k and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering with a nel temperature ( t@xmath9 of 643 k @xcite . in bifeo@xmath4 ,",
    "magnetic ordering is of antiferromagnetic type , having a spiral modulated spin structure ( smss ) with an incommensurate long - wavelength period of 62 nm @xcite .",
    "this spiral spin structure cancels the macroscopic magnetization and inhibits the observation of the linear magnetoelectric effect @xcite .",
    "these problems ultimately limit the use of bulk bifeo@xmath4 in functional applications .",
    "recent investigations demonstrated that in order to perturb the smss and improve the magnetic properties of bifeo@xmath4 , partial substitution of bi by rare - earth ions @xcite or alkaline - earth ions @xcite and also substitution of fe by transition metal ions @xcite is an effective route .",
    "it is also reported that simultaneous minor substitution of bi and fe in bifeo@xmath4 by ions such as la and mn , la and ti , nd and sc etc .",
    ", respectively @xcite also enhanced the magnetism and ferroelectricity in bifeo@xmath4 .",
    "recently , we have observed that simultaneous substitution of gd and ti in place of bi and fe , respectively in bifeo@xmath4 multiferroics improved their morphological , dielectric and magnetic properties at room temperature @xcite .",
    "later on , another group also observed fascinating magnetic , optical and dielectric properties in this gd and ti co - doped bifeo@xmath4 ceramic system at room temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this investigation , we were interested to conduct experiments on temperature dependence of magnetic properties of gd and ti co - doped bi@xmath0gd@xmath1fe@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath4 ( x = 0.00 - 0.20 ) multiferroic materials .",
    "in particular , our interest is to investigate the effect of temperature on remanent magnetization , coercive fields and exchange bias ( eb ) fields of these bulk polycrystalline materials .",
    "notably , the eb phenomenon which manifest itself by a shift of a magnetic hysteresis loop in systems containing ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic bilayers has been studied extensively since many years due to its importance in spintronic applications @xcite .",
    "the eb effect usually occurs when the system is cooled down in an external magnetic field through the magnetic ordering temperatures .",
    "most of the research in this field is focused on specially prepared systems , however , recent investigations reported the presence of eb effect in perovskite manganites @xcite , cobaltites @xcite , heusler alloys @xcite and multiferroics @xcite .",
    "although eb has been observed in various bulk materials , the effect in most cases has been limited to far below room temperature ( @xmath10100 k)@xcite , thus making the systems less attractive for applications .    in our previous investigation",
    ", the magnetization vs. magnetic field ( @xmath11 ) hysteresis loops indicated the presence of exchange bias effect in the gd and ti co - doped bi@xmath0gd@xmath1fe@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath4 ( x = 0.00 - 0.20 ) ceramics at room temperature although the biasing field was very small @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present investigation , we have explored exchange bias effect in this material system at different temperatures ranging from 20 k to 300 k. we have also investigated the influence of cooling magnetic fields at temperatures 150 k and 250 k to observe a tunable exchange bias in sample composition bi@xmath0gd@xmath1fe@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath4 ( this composition is referred as sample x = 0.10 throughout the manuscript ) .",

    "both the coercive fields and remanent magnetizations are higher for sample x = 0.10 than those for x = 0.00 and x = 0.20 . therefore , it is clear that the substitution of 10% ti in place of fe in bi@xmath0gd@xmath1feo@xmath4 compound significantly increased h@xmath13 and m@xmath18 .",
    "however , a further increment of ti to 20% in place of fe reduced h@xmath13 and m@xmath18 although their net values are still higher than that of ti undoped bi@xmath0gd@xmath1feo@xmath4 sample .",
    "as was reported in our previous investigation @xcite , the larger values of h@xmath13 and m@xmath14 in sample x = 0.10 are related with the microstructure of the composition i.e. with homogeneous small grain size of the material . in the case of la and nb co -",

    "m@xmath14 are higher over a wide range of temperatures in sample x = 0.10.,width=340 ]    the remarkable feature observed from figure [ fig2](a ) is that the coercivity of these ceramic samples increases with temperature .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows , as a typical example for x = 0.10 sample , that while the coercivity increases with increasing temperature , the maximum magnetization ( m@xmath22 ) at 50 koe decreases with increasing temperature @xcite . for all studied samples , the coercivity show a strong temperature dependency and the h@xmath13 values are significantly higher at room temperature than that at 20 k. for example , the h@xmath13 value at room temperature for sample x = 0.10 is three times higher than that at 20 k.    the usual trend in a typical magnetic system is for the coercivity to increase with decreasing temperature @xcite since the anisotropy decreases much more sharply than does the magnetization with increasing temperature @xcite . in similar multiferroic material systems , e.g. la doped bifeo@xmath4 @xcite and lufe@xmath23o@xmath24 @xcite , the h@xmath13 values were found to increase at low temperature than that at room temperature .",
    "the unexpected decreasing trend of h@xmath13 at low temperature as compared with the room temperature values for all compositions investigated here may be explained by the presence of magnetoelectric coupling in these multiferroic materials @xcite .",

    "it is worth mentioning that in bifeo@xmath4 ceramic system the exchange bias effect was observed without any magnetic - field - annealing process through t@xmath39 @xcite which is the conventional method of inducing unidirectional anisotropy @xcite .",

    "the @xmath7 values shown in figure [ fig4 ] is observed without applying any cooling magnetic field and therefore the biasing strength is weak and random . in the case of a fm / afm bilayer system , it is well known that cooling magnetic field plays an important role in establishing a strong unidirectional anisotropy due to the exchange coupling @xcite .",
    "hence , in the following experiments , the magnetic hysteresis loops of bi@xmath0gd@xmath1fe@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath4 material were carried out at temperatures 150 k and 250 k by cooling down the sample from 300 k in various cooling magnetic fields ( @xmath6 ) ranging from 20 koe to 60 koe . in each experiment related to cooling magnetic fields ,",

    "the temperature dependent zfc and fc measurements ( figure [ fig3 ] ) demonstrate the absence of any bifurcation from 300 k down to 5 k and therefore , we had conducted the field cooling experiments by cooling the sample from 300 k down to 150 k and 250 k. by using the squid magnetometer ( quantum design mpms - xl7 , usa ) , it was not possible to heat the sample above 300 k ; therefore , the field cooling experiments were not possible to conduct by cooling down this sample through t@xmath39 which is around 520@xmath40 k for bi@xmath0gd@xmath1fe@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath4 ceramic measured from temperature dependent dielectric measurements ( data not shown here ) . as was mentioned earlier , the eb has been observed in various bulk materials , however , the effect in most cases has been limited to low temperatures @xcite .",
