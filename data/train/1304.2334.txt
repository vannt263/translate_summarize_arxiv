    "recent years have seen great progress in neutrino physics @xcite .",
    "thanks to a number of elegant solar , atmospheric , accelerator and reactor neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , two neutrino mixing angles are found to be quite large ( i.e. , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , while two independent neutrino mass - squared differences @xmath9 and @xmath10 are measured with a good degree of accuracy ( i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "the latest results from the daya bay @xcite and reno @xcite experiments reveal that @xmath13 is relatively large , which is very crucial to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy ( i.e. , the sign of @xmath14 ) and to discover the leptonic cp violation ( i.e. , the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath15 ) in the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments . however , the absolute scale of neutrino masses and whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles are still unknown .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "a satisfactory description of tiny neutrino masses and leptonic mixing pattern is still lacking .",
    "although the seesaw mechanisms can be responsible for the generation of light neutrino masses @xcite , they leave the lepton flavor structure intact . in fact",
    ", it was shown one decade ago that the large leptonic mixing can be achieved by taking two independent elements of majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 to be zero , in the flavor basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath16 is diagonal @xcite .",
    "recently , several authors have demonstrated that these seven two - zero textures of @xmath1 still survive the current neutrino oscillation data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out that those texture zeros can be realized by implementing the @xmath17 flavor symmetry in the type - ii seesaw model , where the higgs triplets are introduced to account for tiny majorana neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "apart from texture zeros in the neutrino mass matrix , possible correlations between two matrix elements of @xmath1 have recently been investigated @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we perform a systematic study of @xmath1 with one texture zero and two equal nonzero elements , which has been termed as  hybrid texture \" in the literature @xcite .",
    "the motivation for such an investigation is three - fold .",
    "first , from the phenomenological point of view , either one texture zero or an equality between two independent entries in @xmath1 imposes one constraint condition and thus reduces the number of real free model parameters by two .",
    "hence the hybrid textures are as predictive as the well - known two - zero textures , and deserve a detailed analysis .",
    "see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and @xcite , for previous studies of hybrid textures .",
    "the textures with two equalities and other phenomenological assumptions have also been considered @xcite .",
    "second , it has been proved that a texture zero in any position in @xmath1 can be realized by using abelian flavor symmetries @xmath17 @xcite or @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , the equality between two nonzero matrix elements should come from a non - abelian flavor symmetry .",
    "third , now that a good knowledge about three neutrino mixing angles and two neutrino mass - squared differences has been obtained , it is timely to reexamine the possible structure of @xmath1 and explore the underlying symmetry in the lepton sector .",
    "taking into account current neutrino oscillation data at the @xmath6 level , we have found that thirty - nine out of sixty logically possible hybrid textures of @xmath1 are viable .",
    "if the @xmath19 ranges of neutrino mixing parameters are considered , only thirteen hybrid textures can survive .",
    "the remaining part of our paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , we introduce the hybrid textures and present some useful analytical formulas . then , the stability of texture zeros and equalities in @xmath1 against quantum corrections is briefly discussed by using the one - loop renormalization group equation .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analytical analysis of six viable patterns , which serve as typical examples of hybrid textures .",
    "we show that three neutrino masses @xmath2 and three cp - violating phases @xmath3 can fully be determined from neutrino mixing angles @xmath20 and neutrino mass - squared differences @xmath21 . in section  4 , a thorough numerical analysis has been performed , and the allowed parameter space of the chosen six viable patterns is given .",
    "to illustrate how to realize a hybrid texture , we give a concrete example in section  5 , where a type - ii seesaw model with an @xmath22 flavor symmetry is considered .",
    "finally , we summarize our main conclusions in section  6 .",
    "at low energies , lepton mass spectra and flavor mixing are determined by the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath16 and the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 . we assume massive neutrinos to be majorana particles , as in various seesaw models @xcite , so @xmath1 is in general a @xmath23 symmetric complex matrix .",
    "if one of six independent matrix elements of @xmath1 is taken to be zero and two of the rest are equal , we finally arrive at @xmath24 logically possible textures .",
    "we enumerate all the 39 hybrid textures , which are compatible with current neutrino oscillation data at the @xmath6 level and can be classified into six categories : @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29 @xmath30 where the triangles  @xmath31 \" denote equal and nonzero elements , while the crosses  @xmath32 \" stand for arbitrary and nonzero ones .",
    "if one more element of @xmath1 is assumed to be zero ( or two more elements are equal ) , the number of free parameters in @xmath1 will be further reduced and the viable textures should be much less ( see , for example , ref .",
    "however , we have numerically checked that all those textures have already been excluded by current neutrino oscillation data at the @xmath6 level .      in the basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath16 is diagonal , the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 can be reconstructed from the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath33 and three neutrino masses : @xmath34 the leptonic mixing matrix",
    "can be parametrized as @xmath35 , where the unitary matrix @xmath36 contains three mixing angles @xmath37 and one dirac - type cp - violating phase @xmath15 , namely , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a diagonal matrix with @xmath40 and @xmath41 being two majorana - type cp - violating phases . here",
    "we have defined @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 . for later convenience ,",
    "we rewrite @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "if one matrix element is zero [ e.g. , @xmath49 and two other elements are equal [ e.g. , @xmath50 , where three different independent elements of @xmath1 are considered , we obtain @xmath51 which lead to @xmath52 with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eps.lambda ] ) , one can figure out two neutrino mass ratios @xmath53/2 $ ] and @xmath54/2 $ ] . as we shall show later , these important relations are quite useful in the determination of both neutrino mass spectrum and leptonic cp - violating phases from current experimental observations .",
    "if both @xmath37 and @xmath15 are precisely measured in neutrino oscillation experiments , the unitary matrix @xmath36 is fixed , thus both @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be determined from eq .  ( 11 ) .",
    "the neutrino mass ratios @xmath57 and @xmath58 are related to the ratio of two independent neutrino mass - squared differences as @xmath59 and to three neutrino masses as @xmath60 at present , the cp - violating phase @xmath15 is essentially unconstrained in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "if one of the hybrid textures is assumed , and three neutrino mixing angles and two neutrino mass - squared differences are given , then @xmath15 can be predicted from eq .",
    "( 12 ) . for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy , the latest global - fit analysis yields at the @xmath61 level @xcite @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy , the @xmath6 ranges of neutrino mixing angles and mass - squared differences are slightly different ,",

    ", one can demonstrate that the texture zeros in @xmath1 at a high - energy scale remain there at low - energy scales .",
    "in this subsection , we examine the stability of texture zeros and equality between two matrix elements against quantum corrections .",
    "to be explicit , we consider the unique dimension-5 weinberg operator of massive majorana neutrinos in an effective field theory after the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out @xcite : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the cutoff scale , @xmath68 denotes the left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the standard - model higgs doublet , and @xmath71 stands for the effective neutrino coupling matrix . after spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking",
    ", @xmath72 gains its vacuum expectation value @xmath73 with @xmath74 gev .",
    "we are then left with the effective majorana mass matrix @xmath75 for three light neutrinos from eq .",
    "if the dimension-5 weinberg operator is obtained in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model , one will be left with @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of two higgs doublets .",
    "( 16 ) or its supersymmetric counterpart can provide a simple but generic way of generating tiny neutrino masses .",
    "there are a number of interesting possibilities of building renormalizable gauge models to realize the effective weinberg mass operator , such as the well - known seesaw mechanisms at a superhigh energy scale @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the running of @xmath1 from @xmath67 to the electroweak scale @xmath78 ( or vice versa ) is described by the rge s @xcite . in the chosen flavor basis and at the one - loop level , @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "are related to each other via @xmath81 where the rge evolution function @xmath82 denotes the overall contribution from gauge and quark yukawa couplings , and @xmath83 ( for @xmath84 ) stand for the contributions from charged - lepton yukawa couplings @xcite .",
    "because of @xmath85 as a consequence of @xmath86 , they can modify the texture of @xmath1 . in comparison , @xmath87 only affects the overall mass scale of @xmath1 .",
    "note , however , that the texture zeros of @xmath1 are stable against such quantum corrections induced by the one - loop rge s .",
    "taking * pattern * @xmath88 of @xmath1 for example , we have @xmath89 at @xmath67 , and thus @xmath90 at @xmath91 .",
    "although the texture zero is stable , the equality @xmath92 at @xmath67 is spoiled at the weak scale @xmath91 .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown that @xmath93 ( for @xmath84 ) hold as an excellent approximation in the standard model .",
    "this interesting feature implies that the important relations obtained in eq .  ( 11 ) hold approximately both at @xmath67 and @xmath91 . in other words ,",
    "if a seesaw or flavor symmetry model predicts a hybrid texture of @xmath1 at @xmath67 , one may simply study its phenomenological consequences at @xmath91 by taking account of the same texture zero and equality .",
    "however , the absolute values of neutrino masses are indeed changed when running from a high - energy scale to low - energy scales .",
    "first of all , we point out that there exists a permutation symmetry , which relates one texture to another in eqs .  ( 1)(6 ) . more explicitly , the permutation between 2- and 3-rows of @xmath1 , and that between 2- and 3-columns at the same time , change the position of one zero and two equal elements , giving rise to another hybrid texture @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath1 can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix @xmath36 with mixing parameters @xmath95 , while @xmath94 by a unitary matrix @xmath96 with mixing parameters @xmath97 , it is straightforward to show that these two sets of mixing parameters are related as follows @xcite : @xmath98 moreover , @xmath1 and @xmath94 have the same eigenvalues @xmath99 ( for @xmath100 ) . among 39 viable patterns , one can immediately verify that such a permutation symmetry exists between @xmath101 so the analytical results in eq .",
    "( 11 ) for one hybrid texture can be obtained from those for the corresponding paired one .",
    "hence we are left with only twenty independent patterns .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that @xmath102 is invariant under the permutations of 2- and 3-rows and columns .    in the following ,",
    "we focus on the approximate analytical results for the six patterns @xmath88 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 and explore their implications for neutrino mass spectrum and the leptonic cp - violating phases .",
    "the detailed numerical studies will be given in section 4 .",
    "the analytical approximations for the other patterns can be discussed in a similar way , but they are more or less dependent on whether the mixing angle @xmath108 is close to @xmath109 and whether the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath15 is nearly @xmath110 .",
    "another important motivation to choose these six patterns for illustration is that they provide very concrete predictions either for the mixing angles , or for the neutrino mass hierarchy , or for the dirac cp - violating phase , or for the neutrinoless double - beta decays , which make them phenomenologically more interesting and experimentally more testable than the other patterns .",

    "( 69 ) , with @xmath313 , @xmath314 , @xmath315 , and @xmath316 .",
    "on the other hand , we have to ensure that the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath16 is diagonal .",
