    "loosely speaking , we refer to the sequence of representations @xmath15 as the @xmath0-adic expansion - adic expansion at a fixed @xmath2-th root of unity , not to be confused with an ohsuki - style expansion when @xmath2 goes to infinity ( hence @xmath23 goes to @xmath24 ) which is discussed in @xcite .",
    "] of the tqft representation @xmath10 .",
    "note that each @xmath15 factors through a finite group , since @xmath25 is of finite rank over @xmath17 , which itself is finite .",

    "thus the @xmath0-adic expansion approximates the tqft - representation @xmath10 by representations into bigger and bigger finite groups .",
    "we believe these representations into finite groups deserve further study .",
    "unfortunately , the known formulas for @xmath10 are not well suited to computing the @xmath0-adic expansion explicitly in practice , and new techniques are needed . in this paper",
    "we complete the first step in this direction . that is : we compute explicit matrices for the @xmath0-adic expansion in the case when @xmath30 is a genus one surface with one boundary component .",
    "our formulas give partial information in higher genus as well , but as we do nt yet have a complete answer , we wo nt discuss formulas for the @xmath0-adic expansion in the higher genus case in this paper .",
    "we refer to @xmath31 as a one - holed torus .",
    "as is customary in the tqft world , when dealing with surfaces with boundary , in practice one caps off the boundary circles by disks containing one colored banded point each in their interiors .",
    "( a banded point is a small oriented interval . ) when doing this for @xmath31 , we denote the resulting closed torus by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the color of the banded point ; here @xmath33 can be any even integer satisfying @xmath34 .",
    "mapping classes have to preserve the banded point , so that the dehn twist @xmath35 about a simple closed curve @xmath36 encircling the colored banded point is non - trivial .",
    "thus we are indeed dealing with @xmath37 , the mapping class group of the one - holed torus .",
    "this group has presentation @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are dehn twists @xmath39 and @xmath40 about essential simple closed curves @xmath41 and @xmath42 which avoid the colored banded point and intersect exactly once .",
    "one has @xmath43    we denote by @xmath44 and @xmath45 the endomorphisms of @xmath46 given as @xmath10 of certain lifts of @xmath39 and @xmath40 to the extended mapping class group .",
    "the notation @xmath45 is motivated by the fact that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are adjoint with respect to a symmetric bilinear form @xmath47 called the hopf pairing which will play a crucial role in this paper . to describe the tqft representation @xmath10 in our situation , it suffices to write down matrices for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in the tqft defined over the cyclotomic _ field _",
    "@xmath7 , it is well - known how to do this , because the endomorphism @xmath44 can be diagonalized over @xmath7 using a certain basis of ` colors ' , and the entries of @xmath48 in this basis can then be computed from an appropriate ( generalized ) @xmath49-matrix .",
    "however this basis in which @xmath44 is diagonal is _ not _ an @xmath13-basis for the lattice @xmath46 .",
    "for example , the coefficients of the matrix of @xmath45 in this basis do not lie in @xmath13 .",
    "hence we can not compute the @xmath0-adic expansion of the representation @xmath10 using this basis .    on the other hand , for an arbitrary surface @xmath1 equipped with colored banded points , a @xmath13-basis for the lattice @xmath3 was constructed explicitly in our paper @xcite . in this _ lollipop basis _ , all mapping classes are represented by matrices with coefficients in @xmath13",
    ". however , the explicit formulas we get from @xcite are still not good enough to compute the @xmath0-adic expansion in a nice way .    in the present paper",
    ", we will describe a modification of the construction of @xcite .",
    "the crucial additional property of the bases obtained here is that they are orthogonal with respect to a hopf - like pairing @xmath50 which generalizes the one mentioned above in the genus one case .",
    "we refer to this new basis as the _ orthogonal lollipop basis .",
    "_ we perform its construction in the general situation of a surface @xmath1 equipped with colored banded points , as the higher genus case presents no extra difficulty , and give two immediate applications ( see remarks [ appl1 ] and [ appl2 ] )",

    "let us end this introduction with a brief description of how the tqft - representation @xmath10 looks like in the orthogonal lollipop basis for the one - holed torus , and discuss an application we find interesting .",
    "the lattice @xmath46 has rank @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "the basis we ll construct is denoted by @xmath53 one of its main features is that @xmath44 is upper triangular and @xmath45 is lower triangular in this basis , as will be shown in section  [ ptorus ] .",
    "this fact is also the main reason why the new basis is better than the one described in @xcite , where only one of @xmath44 and @xmath45 would be given by triangular matrix .",
    "the matrix coefficients of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in this basis will be denoted by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , and we will give explicit formulas for them in section  [ ptorus ] .",
    "these formulas can be used to compute the @xmath0-adic expansion of @xmath54 and @xmath55 ; in particular , they make it evident that @xmath54 and @xmath55 lie in @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath44 is upper triangular and @xmath45 is lower triangular is reminiscent of the action of @xmath56 on homogeneous polynomials in two variables .",
    "motivated by this observation , we will show in section  [ sec5 ] that the representation @xmath20 on the @xmath19-vector space @xmath57 factors through @xmath58 and is , in fact , isomorphic to the representation of @xmath58 on the space of homogenous polynomials over @xmath19 in two variables of the appropriate degree @xmath59 .    in order to put this last result into perspective",
    ", we remark that when @xmath60 , it is known @xcite that the representation @xmath10 itself factors through ( a finite central extension of ) @xmath61 , as the situation then reduces to the classical case of the closed torus .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath62 , there is no reason to believe that the representation should factor through @xmath61 . indeed , we conjecture that the representation @xmath10 does _ not _ factor through any finite group , although , of course , each @xmath15 does , as was explained above .",
    "it would follow that the quotient group of the extended mapping class group which acts effectively under the representation @xmath15 must get bigger and bigger as @xmath63 increases , and one of our motivations for this paper was to develop techniques to compute the representations @xmath15 explicitly and efficiently .",
    "the contrast between the cases @xmath60 and @xmath62 are , of course , expected to be related to geometry : a closed torus is euclidean , whereas a torus with non - empty boundary is hyperbolic .",
    "we remark that it is shown in unpublished work of the second author @xcite that for @xmath64 , any pseudo - anosov mapping class @xmath65 in @xmath37 is represented by a matrix of infinite order under @xmath10 if @xmath2 is big enough .",
    "( see @xcite for a proof of the analogous result for the mapping class group of a four - holed sphere . ) in this situation , it follows that the order of @xmath66 must go to infinity as @xmath63 increases , showing in particular that the above - mentioned conjectural picture is correct at least in this case .",
