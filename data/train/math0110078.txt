    "any finite group acts ( smoothly and ) freely preserving orientation on some @xmath1-dimensional handlebody , and the number of inequivalent actions of a fixed @xmath0 on a fixed genus of handlebody can be arbitrarily large @xcite .",
    "consequently , the following imbedding property of such actions may appear surprising at first glance :    let @xmath0 be a finite group acting freely and preserving orientation on two handlebodies @xmath5 and @xmath6 , not necessarily of the same genus .",
    "then there is a @xmath0-equivariant imbedding of @xmath5 into @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , this result is almost a triviality , as is the following theorem of which it is a special case :    let @xmath0 be a finite group acting freely and preserving orientation on a handlebody @xmath2 and on a connected @xmath1-manifold @xmath3 . then there is a @xmath0-equivariant imbedding of @xmath2 into @xmath3 .",
    "[ thm : always ]    by a result of d. cooper and d. d. long @xcite , any finite group acts freely on some hyperbolic rational homology @xmath1-sphere .",
    "so theorem  [ thm : always ] shows that a free @xmath0-action on a handlebody always has an extension to an action on such a @xmath1-manifold . also , by a result of s. kojima @xcite , for any finite @xmath0 there is a closed hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold whose full isometry group is @xmath0 , and kojima s construction actually produces a free action .",
    "so there is an extension to a free action on a closed hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold whose full isometry group is  @xmath0 .",
    "one might ask for a more natural kind of extension , to a free @xmath0-action on a closed @xmath1-manifold @xmath7 , for which @xmath2 is one of the handlebodies in a @xmath0-invariant heegaard splitting of @xmath7 . simply by forming the double of @xmath2 and taking an identical action on the second copy of @xmath2 , one obtains such an extension with @xmath7 a connected sum of @xmath8 s . a better question is whether @xmath2 is an invariant heegaard handlebody for a free action on an irreducible @xmath1-manifold .",
    "our main result answers this affirmatively .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite group acting freely and preserving orientation on a handlebody @xmath2 .",
    "then the action is the restriction of a free @xmath0-action on a closed irreducible @xmath1-manifold @xmath7 , which has a @xmath0-invariant heegaard splitting with @xmath2 as one of the handlebodies .",
    "one may choose @xmath7 to be seifert - fibered .",
    "provided that @xmath2 has genus greater than @xmath9 , one may choose @xmath7 to be hyperbolic .",
    "in both cases , there are infinitely many choices of @xmath7 .",
    "[ thm : irreducible extension ]    we remark that any orientation - preserving action of a finite group on a closed @xmath1-manifold , free or not , has an invariant heegaard splitting . for the quotient is a closed orientable @xmath1-orbifold with @xmath9-dimensional ( possibly empty ) singular set .",
    "one may triangulate the quotient so that the singular set is a subcomplex of the @xmath9-skeleton . then , the preimage of a regular neighborhood of the @xmath9-skeleton is invariant and is one of the handlebodies in a heegaard splitting .    in the remaining sections of this paper ,",
    "we prove theorems  [ thm : always ] and  [ thm : irreducible extension ] . in @xcite , a number of results about free @xmath0-actions on handlebodies are obtained using more algebraic methods .",
    "recall that two @xmath0-actions on spaces @xmath3 and @xmath10 are _ equivalent _ if there is a homeomorphism @xmath11 such that @xmath12 for all @xmath13 and all @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath0 acts properly discontinuously and freely on a path - connected space @xmath3 , then the quotient map @xmath15 is a regular covering map , so by the theory of covering spaces the action determines an extension @xmath16 since we have not specified basepoints , the homomorphism @xmath17 is well - defined only up to an inner automorphism of @xmath0 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath0 is finite and acts freely and preserving orientation on a handlebody @xmath2 .",
    "the quotient manifold @xmath18 is orientable and irreducible with nonempty boundary , so @xmath19 is torsionfree .",
    "a torsionfree finite extension of a finitely generated free group is free ( by  @xcite any finitely generated virtually free group is the fundamental group of a graph of groups with finite vertex groups , and if the group is torsionfree , the vertex groups must be trivial ) .",
    "so @xmath19 is free , and theorem  5.2 of  @xcite shows that @xmath18 is a handlebody . in this context",
    ", we obtain a simple algebraic criterion for equivalence .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 acts freely and preserving orientation on handlebodies @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with quotient handlebodies @xmath20 and @xmath21 , determining homomorphisms @xmath22 . the actions are equivalent if and only if there is an isomorphism @xmath23 for which @xmath24 .",
    "[ lem : equivalence ]    an equivalence of the actions @xmath25 induces a homeomorphism @xmath26 for which @xmath27 .",
    "conversely , suppose @xmath28 exists .",
    "since both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are orientable , there is a homeomorphism @xmath29 . using well - known constructions of homeomorphisms of @xmath21 ( as for example in  @xcite ) ,",
    "all of nielsen s @xcite generators of the automorphism group of the free group @xmath30 can be induced by homeomorphisms , so @xmath31 may be selected to induce @xmath28 .",
    "the condition that @xmath24 then shows that @xmath31 lifts to a homeomorphism of covering spaces @xmath25 , and moreover ensures that @xmath12 .",
    "now we prove theorem  [ thm : always ] .",
    "let @xmath32 be the quotient handlebody of the action on @xmath2 , let @xmath33 , and let @xmath34 and @xmath35 be the homomorphisms determined by the actions .",
    "there is an imbedding @xmath36 so that @xmath37 . for we can regard @xmath32 as a regular neighborhood of a @xmath9-point union @xmath38 of circles ,",
    "so that @xmath39 , and construct a map @xmath40 of @xmath38 into @xmath10 for which @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath38 is @xmath9-dimensional , @xmath40 is homotopic to an imbedding , and since @xmath32 and @xmath10 are orientable , this imbedding extends to an imbedding @xmath42 of @xmath32 into @xmath10 . since @xmath37 , the preimage of @xmath43 in @xmath3 is connected , and by lemma  [ lem : equivalence ] the restricted @xmath0-action on it is equivalent to the original action on  @xmath2 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : always ] extends to the case when some elements of @xmath0 reverse the orientation .",
    "the equivariant imbedding exists if and only if the subgroups of elements of @xmath0 that reverse orientation on @xmath2 and on @xmath3 are identical .",
    "the proof is affected only at the step when the imbedding of @xmath38 into @xmath10 is extended to an imbedding of @xmath32 into @xmath10 .",
    "the equality of the orientation - reversing subgroups is precisely the condition needed for the extension to exist .",
    "if the genus of @xmath2 is @xmath44 , then @xmath0 is trivial and we take @xmath45 .",
    "if the genus of @xmath2 is @xmath9 , so that @xmath46 , then ( using lemma  [ lem : equivalence ] ) every free @xmath0-action is equivalent to a cyclic rotation in the @xmath47-factor . regarding @xmath2 as a trivially fibered solid torus in the hopf fibering of @xmath48 , the action extends to a free action on @xmath48 with @xmath2 an invariant heegaard splitting ( it also extends to free actions on infinitely many lens spaces containing @xmath2 as a fibered heegaard torus ) .",
    "so we may assume that the genus of @xmath2 is greater than @xmath9 .",
    "the quotient handlebody @xmath49 has genus at least  @xmath4 ( since @xmath2 and consequently @xmath32 have negative euler characteristic ) .",
    "we first construct the seifert - fibered extension . as in section",
    "[ sec : always ] , there is a homomorphism @xmath34 that determines the action .",
    "let @xmath50 be the genus of @xmath32 , and let @xmath51 be any positive integer divisible by the orders of all the elements of @xmath0 .",
    "we consider a collection of simple closed curves @xmath52 , @xmath53 in the boundary @xmath54 , as shown in figure  [ fig : heegaard ] for the case when @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "each @xmath57 winds @xmath51 times around one of the handles of @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath58 be the image of @xmath57 under the @xmath59 power of a dehn twist of @xmath54 about the curve @xmath60 .",
    "the union of the @xmath57 does not separate @xmath54 , so neither does the union of the @xmath58 .",
    "so we can obtain a closed @xmath1-manifold @xmath10 with @xmath32 as a heegaard handlebody by attaching @xmath4-handles along the @xmath58 and filling in the resulting @xmath4-sphere boundary component with a @xmath1-ball .",
    "let @xmath61 , @xmath62 be a standard set of generators of @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is represented by a loop that goes once around the @xmath65 handle . in @xmath63 , @xmath57 represents @xmath66 ( up to conjugacy ) , and @xmath58 represents @xmath67 .",
    "since every element of @xmath0 has order dividing @xmath51 , it follows that @xmath17 carries each @xmath58 to the trivial element of @xmath0 , so induces a homomorphism @xmath68 . if @xmath36 is the inclusion , then @xmath37 .",
    "the covering space @xmath7 of @xmath10 has a free @xmath0-action and an invariant heegaard splitting , one of whose handlebodies is the covering space of @xmath32 corresponding to the kernel of @xmath17 , that is , @xmath2 .",
    "we will show that @xmath10 is seifert - fibered , from which it follows that @xmath7 is seifert - fibered .",
    "choose imbedded loops in the interior of @xmath32 : @xmath69 near and parallel to @xmath60 , and @xmath70 , @xmath71 near and parallel to loops @xmath72 in @xmath54 with each @xmath72 going once around the @xmath65 handle , meeting @xmath57 in one point .",
    "the loop @xmath73 appears in figure  [ fig : heegaard ] . by a standard procedure , as explained for example on pp .",
    "275 - 278 of @xcite , whose notation we follow , we may change the attaching curves for the discs by dehn twists about @xmath60 and the @xmath72 , at the expense of performing dehn surgery on @xmath69 and the @xmath74 .",
    "first we twist @xmath51 times along @xmath60 , introducing a @xmath75 coefficient on @xmath69 and moving each @xmath58 back to @xmath57 .",
    "then , @xmath76 twists along each @xmath72 move @xmath57 to a loop @xmath77 in @xmath54 that looks like @xmath57 except it goes only once around the handle .",
    "this creates surgery coefficients of @xmath78 on the @xmath74 .",
    "we may change the attaching homeomorphism of the heegaard splitting by any homeomorphism of @xmath79 that extends over @xmath32 , without changing @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , we may perform left - hand twists in the meridinal @xmath4-discs of the @xmath4-handles to move the @xmath77 to the @xmath72 .",
    "this subtracts @xmath9 from the surgery coefficients of the @xmath74 , and subtracts @xmath50 from the coefficient of @xmath69 , yielding the diagram in figure  [ fig : dehn ] .",
    "the @xmath72 are the attaching curves for the discs of a heegaard description of @xmath48 , so @xmath10 is obtained from @xmath48 by dehn surgery using the diagram .",
    "we can already see a seifert fibering , but we will work out the exact seifert invariants .",
    "the complement of a regular neighborhood of @xmath69 is a solid torus @xmath80 , for which the @xmath74 are fibers of a product fibering .",
    "a cross - sectional surface in this fibering contained in a meridian disc of @xmath80 meets the boundary of a regular neighborhood of each @xmath74 in a meridian circle and meets the boundary of a regular neighborhood of @xmath69 in the negative of the longitude , while the fiber meets them in longitude circles and a meridian circle respectively .",
    "a surgery coefficient @xmath81 means that a solid torus is filled in so that @xmath82 becomes contractible , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are a meridian - longitude pair for a boundary torus of a regular neighborhood of the link component .",
    "a seifert invariant @xmath85 determines a filling in which @xmath86 becomes contractible , where @xmath87 is the cross - section and @xmath88 is the fiber .",
    "so the surgery coefficients of our link produce one exceptional fiber with seifert invariant @xmath89 for each @xmath74 , and one with seifert invariants @xmath90 for @xmath69 .",
    "in the notation of @xcite , the unnormalized seifert invariants of @xmath10 are @xmath91 , where there are @xmath92 exceptional orbits .",
    "the normalized invariants are @xmath93 .",
    "now , we will construct the extension of the @xmath0-action on @xmath2 to a hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold .",
    "as before , let @xmath51 be any positive integer divisible by the orders of all the elements of @xmath0 .",
    "assume for the time being that @xmath94 .",
    "we take the same curves @xmath95 and @xmath96 as in the seifert - fibered construction , but for @xmath60 we take the image of the loop @xmath97 shown in figure  [ fig : hyperbolic2 ] under the homeomorphism of @xmath32 which is a right - hand twist in a meridinal disc in each of the two @xmath9-handles .      as",
    "before , we take the images of the @xmath57 under the @xmath59 power of a dehn twist about @xmath60 as the attaching curves , form the closed manifold @xmath10 , and use the induced homomorphism @xmath98 to obtain the original @xmath0-action as an invariant heegaard handlebody of a free @xmath0-action on a covering space @xmath7 of @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath73 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath69 be as before .",
    "we choose the @xmath74 to lie closer to the boundary of @xmath32 than @xmath69 .",
    "again , change the attaching curves first by the inverse of the @xmath51 dehn twists about @xmath60 , introducing a surgery coefficient of @xmath75 on @xmath69 , then by the @xmath76 twists about the @xmath72 , introducing surgery coefficients @xmath78 on the @xmath74 . applying left - hand twists in the meridian discs of the two @xmath9-handles of @xmath32 , we move the attaching curves to the @xmath72 , obtaining the surgery description of @xmath10 shown in figure  [ fig : whitehead ] .",
    "this time , the coefficient of @xmath69 is still @xmath75 , because @xmath69 has algebraic intersection @xmath44 with each of the meridian discs of the handles of @xmath10 where the left - hand twists were performed .",
    "the complement of this link is a @xmath4-fold covering of the complement of the whitehead link , so is hyperbolic . by @xcite , dehn surgery on",
    "the link produces a hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold , provided that one avoids finitely many choices for the coefficients of each component .",
    "so all but finitely many choices for @xmath51 yield a hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold for @xmath10 , and hence for @xmath7 .",
    "finally , to adapt the construction to arbitrary genus , one simply adds more components to @xmath97 to obtain the @xmath102 circles shown in figure  [ fig : hyperbolic ] . in the surgery description for @xmath10 , the chain @xmath103 in figure  [ fig : whitehead ] is replaced by a chain of length @xmath104 , in which @xmath105 , @xmath106 alternate with components from @xmath97 , and the component @xmath71 links the chain as did @xmath101 in figure  [ fig : whitehead ] .",
    "the @xmath74 have surgery coefficients @xmath107 as before , and the components coming from @xmath97 have coefficient @xmath75 , since each had algebraic intersection @xmath44 with the union of the meridian discs .",
    "the link complement is the @xmath108-fold covering of the whitehead link complement , so is hyperbolic , and the argument is completed as before ."
