    ". the launch will be in 2012 using a soyuz-2 rocket from bajkonur into an orbit around l2 .",
    "the payload consists of the x - ray instruments erosita ( extended roentgen survey with an imaging telescope array ) and art - xc ( astronomical roentgen telescope  x - ray concentrator ) .",
    "the seven erosita telescopes are based on the existing design launched on the abrixas mission plus an advanced version of the pnccd camera successfully flying on xmm - newton . in order to optimize erosita for the dark energy studies ,",
    "the effective area is increased by a factor of five , the angular resolution is improved by a factor of two , and the field of view is also increased by a factor of two with respect to abrixas .",
    "such a design has been drawn to match the outcome of the most recent calls for ideas on dark energy observations ( like e.g. by nasa , doe , esa , eso and others ) .",
    "similarly to erosita art - xc contains 7 telescopes working in the energy range between 6 and 30 kev .",
    "the telescopes are conical approximations of the wolter - i geometry with cdte detectors in their focal planes ( pavlinsky et al . , 2010 , this volume )",

    "the galaxy cluster population provides information on the cosmological parameters in several complementary ways :    1 .",
    "the cluster mass function in the local universe mainly depends on the matter density @xmath7 and the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   the evolution of the mass function f(m , z )",
    "is directly determined by the growth of structure in the universe and therefore gives at the same time sensitive constraints on dark matter and dark energy .",
    "3 .   the amplitude and shape of the cluster power spectrum , p(k ) and its growth with time , depend sensitively on dark matter and dark energy .",
    "baryonic wiggles due to the acoustic oscillations at the time of recombination are still imprinted on the large scale distribution of clusters ( i.e. in their p(k ) and the autocorrelation function ) and thus can give tight constraints on the curvature of space at different epochs .",
    "the constraints provided by the different cosmological tests with clusters are complementary in such a way , that degeneracies in the parameter constraints in any of the tests can be broken by combinations .",
    "the simultaneous constraint of @xmath7 and @xmath8 by combining method 1 and 3 above is one such example @xcite .",
    "in addition the combination of several tests provides important consistency checks as explained below .",
    "in addition to the above applications , galaxy clusters have been used as cosmological standard candles to probe absolute distances , analogous to the cosmological tests with supernovae type ia .",
    "the assumption that the cluster baryon fraction is constant with time combined with observations of this quantity provides constraints on dark matter and dark energy , e.g. @xcite ) . in a very similar way , combined",
    "x - ray and sunyaev - zeldovich - measurements provide a mean for absolute distance measurements and constraints of the geometry of the universe , e.g. @xcite .",
    "+ large , well defined and statistically complete samples of galaxy clusters ( which are dynamically well evolved and for which masses are approximately known ) are obvious prerequisites for such studies .",
    "a substantial progress in the field requires samples of tens to hundreds of thousands of clusters .",
    "surveys at several wavelengths are used or planned to be used to achieve this goal .",
    "more in general , in x - ray surveys , galaxy clusters are detected by the radiation of the hot intracluster medium and x - ray observations are still the most efficient tools to select clean cluster samples . in addition",
    "x - ray observations provide accurate estimates of the cluster physical parameters .",
    "indeed the x - ray luminosity is tightly correlated to the gravitational mass , temperature and core radius @xcite .",
    "therefore most cosmological studies involving galaxy clusters are based on x - ray surveys ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the mirror replication technique was developed for xmm - newton and has then been applied to the small satellite mission abrixas , which had scaled the xmm - newton telescopes down by a factor of about 4 .",
    "the abrixas optical design and manufacturing process are adopted for erosita partially because the inner 27 mirror shells and therefore the focal length are kept the same .",
    "the mirror system consists of 7 mirror modules with 54 mirror shells each and a x - ray baffle in front of each module . unlike on abrixas ,",
    "the seven optical axes are co - aligned . compared to a large single mirror system ,",
    "the advantages of a multiple mirror system are : shorter focal length ( reduced instrumental background ) and reduced pileup when observing bright sources .",
    "this configuration allows a more compact telescope and multiple but identical cameras which automatically provides a 7-fold redundancy .",
    "the capabilities of the x - ray mirror system are described by effective area , vignetting function , and psf .",
    "the production of the flight mirrors has already started .",

    "the 384 channels are read out in parallel .",
    "the nominal integration time for erosita will be 50 msec .",
    "the integrated image can be shifted into the frame store area by less than 100 msec before it is read out within about 5 msec .",
    "ccd together with the two camex and the ( passive ) front - end electronics are integrated on a ceramic printed circuit board ( ccd - module ) and is connected to the `` outer world '' by a flexlead . the flight - ccds have already been fabricated . for operation",
    "the ccds have to be cooled down to -80 @xmath4c by means of passive elements ( heatpipes and radiator ) .",
    "fluorescence x - ray radiation generated by cosmic particles is minimized by a graded shield consisting of aluminum and boron carbide . for calibration purposes ,",
    "each camera housing contains a radioactive fe@xmath12 source and an aluminum target providing two spectral lines at 5.9 kev ( mn - k@xmath13 ) and 1.5 kev ( al - k@xmath13 ) .",

    "also the telescope structure is also qualified .",
    "the optical bench connects the mirror system and the baffles on one side with the focal plane instrumentation on the other side .",
    "additionally it forms the mechanical interface to the s / c bus .",
    "the flight model manufacturing is ongoing .",

    "the effective area of erosita is about twice that of one xmm - newton telescope in the energy band below 2kev , whereas it is three times less at higher energies .",
    "this is a consequence of the small f - ratio ( focal length vs. aperture ) of the erosita mirrors .",
    "an advantage of the short focal length is also larger field of view .",
    "the erosita angular resolution is 15 arcsec on - axis . due to the unavoidable off - axis degradation of a wolter - i telescope",

    "2 ) . we will scan the entire sky for four years ( rosat 1/2 year ) .",
    "therefore the erosita sensitivity during this all - sky survey will be approximately 30 times rosat . with the current scanning strategy",
    ", we expect an average exposure of @xmath13 ks in the all - sky survey , with two deep fields at the ecliptic poles with an exposure of the order of 20 - 40 ks , depending on the actual mission strategy .",
    "we have performed simulations of the radiation environment in l2 and determined , by including the cosmic components , a background intensity of 5.63 cts s@xmath18 deg@xmath19 and 3.15 cts s@xmath18 deg@xmath19 in the 0.52 kev and 210 kev energy bands , respectively .",

    "the proposed survey will identify 50,000  100,000 clusters depending on the capabilities in disentangle moderately - low extended sources from agn . concerning the number of agn we can use the logn - logs measurement in moderately wide field surveys , like xmm - cosmos @xcite , @xcite , to predict the detection 3 - 10@xmath1110@xmath24 sources , up to z@xmath17 - 8 , depending on the detection threshold .",
    "a simulation of a 3 ks erosita observation of a typical extragalactic field is shown in figure 3 .",
    "multi - band optical surveys to provide the required photometric and spectroscopic redshifts are already in the planning stages , and will be contemporaneous with or precede our survey .",
