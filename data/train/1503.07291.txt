    "the performance of wireless systems is fundamentally constrained by limited device battery life . as frequent battery replacement /",
    "recharging by manual operation is often costly and inconvenient , numerous energy - conservation methods have been proposed to prolong the operating lifetime of wireless communication networks , via transmit power control , energy - aware medium access control ( mac ) and routing selection , etc @xcite .",
    "alternatively , radio frequency enabled ( rf - enabled ) _ wireless power transfer _",
    "( wpt ) technologies provide an attractive solution to power wireless devices ( wds ) over the air @xcite . by leveraging the far - field radiative properties of microwave",
    ", wds could harvest energy remotely from the rf signals radiated by the dedicated energy transmitter @xcite .",
    "currently , rf power in milliwatt ( mw ) level could be effectively transferred to wds from a distance of more than @xmath0 meters .",
    "the received rf energy is sufficient to power the activities of many low - power devices , such as sensors and rf identification ( rfid ) tags , where some commercial rf - enabled wpt products have already been developed by powercast corp .",
    "besides , the recent development of mimo technology significantly boosts the energy transfer efficiency @xcite , which also opens up more potential applications for rf - enabled wpt in the future .",
    "the practical advantages of wpt have recently attracted increasing efforts to develop wireless powered communication systems @xcite . among them , wpt for broadband networks is of particular interest , where both wireless information and power transfer could benefit from the broadband channel diversity @xcite .",
    "however , unlike information transfer , wpt does not introduce detrimental interference to unintended co - channel receivers .",
    "this fundamental difference motivates this study to redesign the _ mac mechanism _ in wpt - enabled broadband systems for efficient charging coordination among the distributed wds , which are of general power usage besides communication purpose .",
    "efficient wpt control in broadband systems requires the energy transmitter to have accurate knowledge of both the channel state information ( csi ) and battery state information ( bsi ) of wds .",
    "while accurate csi could effectively enhance the energy transfer efficiency , well - informed bsi helps reduce energy outage rate by transmitting on the sub - channels in favor of those close - to - outage wds .",
    "although being assumed by many previous studies for the simplicity of analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in practice , however , achieving perfect knowledge of csi / bsi consumes significant amount of energy for the wds to perform csi estimation and csi / bsi feedback .",
    "the energy cost to the wds may even offset the power gain obtained from more refined transmit power allocation .",
    "in this paper , we propose a new cost - effective charging control method in wpt - based broadband networks .",
    "the proposed method has the following main features and advantages :    1 .",
    "a multi - criteria charging policy is proposed based on the analysis of expected network lifetime of wpt - based systems .",
    "specifically , different metrics are used to evaluate the energy - harvesting performance of the wds depending on their residual battery levels or bsi .",
    "2 .   the charging control policy is implemented by a novel limited csi estimation mechanism embedded with partial bsi , which incurs very low complexity and energy cost on csi / bsi feedback . in particular ,",
    "simulations show that good system performance is achievable even with very limited csi feedback , e.g. , by estimating at most @xmath1 out of @xmath2 sub - channels for a wd to feed back .",
    "the network lifetime performance of the proposed multi - criteria method is _ robust _ against different network deployment , and could be further optimized by tuning the control parameters according to specific applications .",
    "the performance advantage of the proposed multi - criteria charging control method is evaluated through extensive simulations and comparisons with other heuristically designed single - criterion based benchmark schemes .",
    "we consider a wpt - enabled broadband wireless network , where an energy node ( en ) is connected to a stable power source and broadcasts rf energy to power @xmath3 distributed wds .",
    "each wd has an rf energy harvesting circuit and rechargeable battery of capacity @xmath4 to store the harvested energy and power the activities of the wd , e.g. , event sensing or data transmission .",
    "the bandwidth of the system is @xmath5 hz , which is equally divided into @xmath6 sub - channels each with bandwidth @xmath7 .",
    "the wireless channels are assumed to be reciprocal in the uplink and downlink , and independent among the wds .",
    "for the simplicity of exposition , we assume that the channel experiences block fading , where the sub - channel gains remain constant in a transmission block of length @xmath8 and vary independently over different blocks .",
    "notice that the block fading assumption does not affect the validity of our analysis or the operation of the proposed protocols .    in the @xmath9-th transmission block , @xmath10",
    ", we use @xmath11 to denote the channel power gain of the @xmath12-th sub - channel between the en and the @xmath13-th wd , @xmath14 to denote the transmit power of the en on the @xmath12-th sub - channel .",
    "the total transmit power is bounded by @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "then , the harvested energy by the @xmath13-th wd within the block is @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 $ ] is a fixed parameter denoting the energy harvesting efficiency which is assumed to be known by the en .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the residual energy of the @xmath13-th wd at the end of @xmath9-th transmission block , and @xmath20 denote the amount of energy consumed within the transmission block .",
    "within each block , we assume that the energy consumption rate is constant so that the energy level increases or decreases monotonically .",
    "then , the residual energy at the end of the @xmath21-th block is @xmath22 in this paper , @xmath20 is assumed to follow a general distribution with an average consumption rate @xmath23= \\mu_k t$ ] , @xmath24 .",
    "the output voltage of a battery decreases with the residual energy level .",
    "we say an _ energy outage _ occurs if the remaining energy of a wd @xmath13 is no larger than a certain threshold @xmath25 , such that normal device operation could not be maintained . without loss of generality , we set @xmath26 throughout this paper .",
    "given the initial battery level @xmath27 $ ] , we define _ network lifetime _ as the duration until a wd is in energy outage .",
    "whenever an energy outage occurs , the device in energy outage will enter a hibernation mode , which harvests rf energy and returns to normal operation only after the battery level reaches a prescribed threshold @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this is a common practice to avoid frequent energy outage for continuous device operation .",
    "notice that the results obtained from homogeneous battery assumption here could also be extended to heterogeneous case ( i.e. , wds have different capacities and threshold parameters ) by scaling the respective channel gains and energy consumption rates accordingly .",
    "due to channel diversities among the wds over both time and frequency , the network lifetime is determined by the transmit power allocation strategy @xmath30 $ ] over time @xmath31 . besides , the knowledge of csi and bsi , although costly to obtain , is critical to the performance of transmit power allocation . in the following ,",
    "we first analyze the impact of charging control method to the network lifetime . based on the analysis",
    ", we then propose an efficient charging control method with limited csi / bsi feedback mechanism .",
    "a point to notice is that the network lifetime is affected by many factors besides transmit power allocation , such as en placement , total transmit power and channel distributions . in this section",
    ", we assume that all the other parameters are fixed to focus on the design of transmit power allocation policy .",
    "we denote @xmath32 as the expected network lifetime achieved by a charging policy @xmath33 . specifically , a charging control policy @xmath33 specifies the transmit power allocation in each transmission block , and thus the harvested energy @xmath34 , for @xmath35 and @xmath31 . to void trivial results",
    ", we assume that the expected network lifetime is finite regardless of the charging policy used , i.e. , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the set of all feasible policies that satisfy the transmit sum - power constraint , @xmath38 . in other words",
    ", @xmath38 is assumed to be sufficiently small , so that the total energy harvesting rate is always lower than the consumption rate , to be consistent with the condition in ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "in fact , as verified later by simulations , a charging policy @xmath33 that achieves a longer @xmath32 under a given transmit power budget also requires lower transmit power to achieve near - perpetual network operation ( i.e. , @xmath32 is a very large number ) .",
    "therefore , finding the optimal charging policy under finite network lifetime assumption also has important implication in practical system designs with the guarantee of sufficiently large @xmath32 .",
    "the actual battery dynamic in ( [ 2 ] ) complicates the analysis because of the max / min operators , yet unable to provide extra insight into charging policy design . to make the problem tractable ,",
    "we adjust the battery model as follows :    1 .",
    "the energy level could surpass the battery capacity at the end of a transmission block , but such an overcharged battery can not harvest any energy in the following transmission block(s ) until the energy level drops below the capacity due to power usage ; 2 .",
    "when an energy outage occurs , the residual energy could be negative at the end of the current transmission block .",
    "the first modification helps remove the min operator in ( [ 2 ] ) , while ensuring that the energy level is approximately upper bounded by the capacity @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , it overestimates the harvested energy when battery is fully - charged in a transmission block , but underestimates the harvested energy in the following transmission block(s ) .",
    "the second modification removes the max operator in ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "both modifications have limited effect to the modeling accuracy , because a practical transmission block length is sufficiently small , such that the energy harvested / consumed within a block is marginal compared to the battery capacity . with the two minor modifications , we could express the battery dynamics as a random process @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the harvested energy in the @xmath21-th transmission block of the modified battery model , with @xmath41 given in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the average energy harvesting rate is determined by the control policy @xmath33 , and denoted by @xmath42/t$ ] .",
    "accordingly , an energy outage occurs if @xmath43 .",
    "equivalently , the charging problem could be modeled by a gambling game with the @xmath3 wds as gamblers .",
    "@xmath19 is the balance of gambler @xmath13 , who continuously plays a betting game with @xmath44 as the income and @xmath45 as the loss in the @xmath21-th bet , @xmath16 .",
    "the game starts with each gambler holding @xmath46 initial balance , and stops once a gambler s balance becomes zero or negative .",
    "then , the stopping time of the game is also the network lifetime .",
    "evidently , the game is unfair because the average income and loss of each bet are not equal in general , i.e. , @xmath47 . in particular ,",
    "a gambler @xmath13 receives zero income in the @xmath21-th bet when @xmath48 . in the following , we derive the expected stopping time of the above gambling game by constructing an auxiliary fair game , such that martingale stopping time theorem @xcite could be applied .",
    "we first introduce an auxiliary random process @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath16 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath52 could be considered as the cumulative compensation given to gambler @xmath13 up to the @xmath9-th bet , where the gambler is compensated for @xmath53 in the @xmath9-th bet if its balance before the bet , i.e. , @xmath54 , is less than @xmath4 .",
    "otherwise , it receives @xmath55 if @xmath56 .",
    "the following lemma shows that the random process @xmath57 is a martingale .",
    "_ lemma 1 : _ the random process @xmath58 is a martingale , or equivalently the bet is a fair game .    _",

    "condition @xmath59 ) holds from the assumption that @xmath62 ( the number of bets ) is finite . for condition @xmath63 ) , we have for each @xmath13 @xmath64 \\\\ = & z_k^j + \\mathbb{e}\\left[\\bar{q}_{k}^{j } - \\mathbb{e}_{k}^{j}\\right ] + \\mathbf{1}_{kj}^{c}\\cdot \\mu_k t + \\left(1- \\mathbf{1}_{ij}^{c}\\right)\\cdot(\\mu_k-\\lambda_k^{\\psi})t = z_k^j , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is an indicator function that equals @xmath59 if @xmath66 and @xmath67 otherwise .",
    "this completes the proof . @xmath68",

    "similarly , at the end of the @xmath5-th bet , we have @xmath77 = \\mathbb{e}\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^k x_k^w\\right ] + \\mathbb{e}\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^k y_k^w\\right ] \\\\   &",

    "for the second condition , the optimal policy is the _ max - rate _ approach , i.e. , maximizing the total harvested energy by all the wds in each transmission block . for the third condition ,",
    "the optimal policy is the _ min - max _ approach , i.e. , minimizing the maximum residual energy among the wds after each transmission block . in a practical wireless powered network , however , the above three charging policies may conflict with each other . for instance , the max - rate approach is strongly biased towards nearby wds with high average channel gains .",
    "the power allocation of the max - min approach , however , is in favor of wds that are far - away from the en with smaller channel gains .",
    "this simple fairness - efficiency tradeoff indicates that the three objectives could not be satisfied by a single - criterion charging policy in general .    to balance the three objectives",
    ", we therefore consider a multi - criteria approach .",
    "our observation is that overcharging only occurs to close - to - capacity wds .",
    "thus , the en should apply a min - max criterion to the close - to - capacity wds , to discourage allocating power to the sub - channels that may lead to overcharge in the coming transmission block(s ) .",
    "besides , using max - min approach to charge the currently close - to - outage wds could effectively reduce @xmath85 , because otherwise larger amount of energy will be harvested by the wds of moderate / high energy levels in the subsequent transmission block(s ) , leading to higher @xmath85 . for those wds of moderate energy levels ,",
    "the max - rate approach is most suitable , because charging them with the highest efficiency does not have immediate effect to either @xmath78 s or @xmath85 , but could effectively enhance the sum charging rate @xmath87 .",
    "the above analysis motivates a multi - criteria charging control method that jointly considers the csi and bsi .",
    "however , a practical question arises on how to efficiently feed back csi / bsi to the en in an energy - constrained broadband system with a large number of wds and sub - channels . to tackle this problem ,",
    "we propose in the following a simple yet efficient charging control protocol based on limited csi / bsi feedback .",
    "in this section , we propose a multi - criteria charging control protocol using a limited csi feedback mechanism .",
    "the protocol operates in the following steps and is illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath88 . without causing confusions ,",
    "we omit the transmission block index @xmath9 in this section for the brevity of notation .    1 .   at the beginning of a transmission block",
    ", the en sends pilot signals on the @xmath6 sub - channels .",
    "then , each wd @xmath13 estimates its own sub - channel power gains , i.e. , @xmath89 s ; 2 .",
    "depending on the residual energy @xmath90 , each wd @xmath13 sends back to the en orthogonal narrowband pilot signals on its @xmath91 strongest sub - channels , with @xmath92 where @xmath93 are positive integers , and @xmath94 are two predetermined energy thresholds . the subset of sub - channels reported by wd @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath95 , @xmath35 .",
    ", we assume that the channel estimation by the en is perfect . besides the knowledge of the channel gains , i.e. , @xmath96 , the en is also aware of the quantized bsi of each wd by counting the number of pilots sent by the wds , i.e. , @xmath91 s . the en then optimizes its transmit power allocation on all the sub - channels using a policy detailed later in ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "4 .   the wds harvest rf energy in the remaining transmission block .",
    "then , the iteration repeats from step @xmath97 .    instead of sending pilots on all the sub - channels , each wd only reports on a small subset of sub - channels with the largest channel gains , which significantly reduces the energy cost .",
    "the intuition behind is that transmit power is in general only allocated to relatively strong sub - channels , thus the knowledge of weak sub - channels csi has marginal effect to the power allocation solution . although consuming more energy to send pilots on a larger number of sub - channels , from ( [ 10 ] ) , a wd of lower residual energy could in fact benefit from a more favorable power allocation due to the better knowledge of csi by the en . on the other hand",
    ", the number of pilots sent by a wd also contains partial bsi indicating the energy level , which will be exploited by our proposed power control .",
    "in addition , the values of @xmath98 could be tuned in different scenarios , e.g. , setting @xmath99 such that a wd sends energy request only when it is close to outage .",
    "the impact of these parameters will be shown by simulations .",
    "the knowledge of csi and bsi enables a multi - criteria charging policy as discussed in section iii.c .",
    "in particular , from the values of @xmath91 s , the en is aware of the subsets of wds in low , moderate and high residual energy levels , denoted by @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "we design the en to allocate transmit power @xmath102 to the @xmath12-th sub - channel , @xmath103 , by solving the following linear programming ( lp ) problem : @xmath104 where @xmath105 denotes the estimated harvested energy by the @xmath13-th wd , given by @xmath106 , where @xmath107 , & i\\notin   \\mathcal{m}_k . \\end{cases}\\ ] ] the three terms in the objective of ( [ 5 ] ) denote the weighted energy harvested by wds in @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . @xmath108 and @xmath109 are two positive weights set for balancing the three terms .",
    "specifically , the first term maximizes the minimum harvested energy of the close - to - outage wds .",
    "the second term maximizes the total harvested energy by the wds with moderate energy level .",
    "the last term discourages the en to charge the close - to - capacity wds . generally speaking , a larger ( smaller )",
    "@xmath108 would enhance the energy harvesting efficiency ( fairness ) .",
    "a larger @xmath109 would increase the penalty to charge the wds that are close - to - capacity .",
    "in general , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are set much smaller than @xmath59 to ensure that priority is given to the close - to - outage wds .",
    "note that from ( [ 6 ] ) , @xmath105 is calculated using both the _ explicit _ csi reported on @xmath95 , and the _ implicit _ csi for those sub - channels not reported by wd @xmath13 . in ( [ 6 ] )",
    ", we use conditional expectation to calculate @xmath110 given that the channel gains of unreported sub - channels are lower than the known channel gains in @xmath95 .",
