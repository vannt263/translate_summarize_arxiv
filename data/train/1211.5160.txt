    "hidden sectors , especially with light extra u(1 ) gauge bosons , arise naturally in different standard model extensions like string theory and supersymmetry .",
    "they recently attracted much attention since the so - called `` hidden photon '' could account for the discrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite and , in addition , dark matter ( dm ) interacting through a light dark force has been considered as explanation for recent astrophysical observations  @xcite .",
    "the only interaction between the hidden sector and the standard model is through kinetic mixing of the hidden photon @xmath0 with the ordinary photon , generated for example by integrating out heavy particles charged under both u(1)s  @xcite .",
    "therefore we assume the kinetic mixing , parametrized by @xmath1 , to be of the order of a loop factor @xmath2 and impose the following relation with the hidden gauge coupling @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an @xmath6 factor depending on the masses of the particles in the loop .",
    "the low energy effective lagrangian of the most simple hidden sector containing only an extra u(1 ) symmetry and the corresponding hidden photon @xmath0 is then given by @xmath7 with the field strength @xmath8 of the ordinary electromagnetic field @xmath9 and the field strength @xmath10 of the hidden u(1 ) field @xmath11 .",
    "the mass @xmath12 of the hidden photon , generated either by the higgs or the stckelberg mechanism , can naturally be obtained at the gev - scale  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give an update on the experimental constraints on @xmath1 vs @xmath12 in sec .",
    "[ sec - hp ] and discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec - dm ] different models for dm interacting through a hidden photon with respect to the relic density and signature in direct detection , based on our analysis presented in  @xcite .",
    "different laboratory experiments constrain the hidden photon through its coupling to sm fermions .",
    "in addition to the limits summarized in  @xcite several new exclusions arose over the last year . they will be described in the following and are shown in colour in fig .",
    "[ fig - hplimits ] on the left .",
    "neutrino experiments at cern place constraints on hidden photons since neutral pseudoscalar mesons generated in the proton beams can produce spin-1 particles in their radiative decay .",
    "limits have been derived for nomad and ps191 using @xmath13 decays in  @xcite ( brown double - dash - dotted line ) and for charm from @xmath14 and @xmath15 decays in  @xcite ( orange dash - dotted line ) .",
    "the constraint from the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron @xmath16 , which was derived in  @xcite together with the one of the muon , has recently been updated in  @xcite ( green dashed line ) .",
    "another limit , derived in  @xcite from the kaon decay @xmath17 ( magenta dotted line ) , would have improved the former constraint of @xmath16 but is not competitive with the improved one .",
    "constraints from electron beam dump experiments searching for the decay of hidden photons produced in bremsstrahlung have been derived in  @xcite for the e141 and e137 experiments at slac as well as e774 at fermilab . in  @xcite we considered two additional experiments at kek in japan  @xcite and at the orsay linac in france  @xcite .",
    "the former was originally searching for axionlike particles and for the latter , designed to look for light higgs bosons , the possibility to constrain @xmath18-bosons ( similar to @xmath0 but additional axial couplings ) had also been suggested in  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the new limits we reanalysed the earlier ones including the experimental acceptances which we obtained from monte carlo simulations with madgraph .",
    "the resulting renewed    r0.69         limits are shown in gray in fig .",
    "[ fig - hplimits ] ( left ) together with the new ones from kek ( red long - dashed line ) and orsay ( blue solid line ) .",
    "the experiment at the da@xmath19ne @xmath19-factory in frascati has recently released a new limit  @xcite ( pink dash - double - dotted line ) for hidden photons produced in @xmath19 decays and subsequently decaying into @xmath20 which improved their previous bound  @xcite .",
    "we assume the simplest possible hidden sector containing a hidden photon and one additional dirac fermion as dark matter candidate ( cf .  @xcite ) .",
    "the hidden photon mediates both the dm annihilation and the dm scattering on nuclei thereby determining both the dm relic abundance and direct detection rate .",
    "applying relation  ( [ eq - kappa ] ) with @xmath21 we find that dm with a mass of 6 gev has the correct relic abundance in the dark green band in fig .",
    "[ fig - hplimits ] ( right ) while it provides a subdominant contribution to the total dm density in the light green area . in the latter case ,",
    "the spin - independent ( si ) scattering cross section @xmath22 was rescaled by the relic abundance .",
    "we find that the cross sections in the purple band ( 90% cl lighter , 99% cl darker purple ) can explain the cogent signal for a standard halo model .",
    "constraints from cdms    r0.34     and xenon do not apply to dm masses as light as 6 gev and are thus not displayed .",
    "the excluded grey areas are the same as displayed in the left plot .",
    "the dm mass , being a free parameter of the model , can be scanned over and thereby allows to cover the entire parameter space as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - scattplot ] . again",
    ", dark green corresponds to the correct relic abundance , light green to subdominant dm and purple to points in agreement with cogent ( all points are allowed by all other direct detection limits ) .",
    "further results for different dm masses , values of @xmath5 and halo models are presented in  @xcite .      with the aim to construct more sophisticated and better motivated models ,",
    "we consider the simplest possible anomaly - free supersymmetric hidden sector model without adding dimensionful supersymmetric quantities .",
    "therefore , we take the superpotential @xmath23 with the dimensionless coupling  @xmath24 and three chiral superfields @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are charged under the hidden u(1 ) .",
    "we assume the mssm in the visible sector , however , the dm phenomenology of the hidden sector is largely independent of this choice and instead determined by    r0.69         the way the hidden gauge symmetry is broken .",
    "if the hidden gauge symmetry is broken via the effective fayet - iliopoulos term induced in the hidden sector through kinetic mixing with the visible higgs d - term , the dm can be either a dirac or a majorana fermion .",
    "the former has si scattering with a similar phenomenology as in the case of the toy - model .",
    "scanning over a range of dm masses and @xmath28 , the scatter plot on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig - susyscattplot ] shows again in dark green the points that give the correct relic abundance and in purple those consistent with cogent for a standard halo model .",
    "the majorana fermion on the other hand has mostly axial couplings and therefore the scattering is spin - dependent ( sd ) and only weakly constraint by direct detection experiments . because of the higgs - portal term ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) si scattering is possible but cross sections are several orders of magnitude below and without any chance of explaining signals in si direct detection experiments . in the case where the hidden gauge symmetry breaking is induced by the running of the yukawa coupling @xmath24 ,",
    "a majorana fermion remains as lightest particle in the spectrum .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - susyscattplot ] , it can produce the total relic abundance ( dark green ) or give a subdominant contribution ( light green ) but as the scattering is again mostly sd it is not able to account for the signals in si direct detection experiments .",
    "hidden sectors are motivated both from a top - down ( string theory , susy ) and bottom - up ( g-2 , dm ) perspective . possibly containing gauge and matter fields they can be phenomenologically of interest for dark forces and dm .",
    "there is much experimental activity to constrain hidden photons .",
    "we presented here an overview of the latest limits . for hidden sectors containing also dm we showed that a simple toy - model with dirac fermion dm is consistent with relic abundance and direct detection requirements and additionally able to have the correct cross section for cogent .",
    "a more sophisticated supersymmetric hidden sector gives a similar dm phenomenology if the breaking of the hidden gauge symmetry is induced by the visible sector .",
    "furthermore , in this case or for radiatively induced breaking , it is also possible to have a majorana fermion with dominant sd scattering as dm candidate .",
    "thus , supersymmetric models with gravity mediation give viable dm candidates with interesting signatures in experiments .",
