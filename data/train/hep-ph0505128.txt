    "the effective picture in this framework relies upon @xmath1channel `` reggeized '' gluons interacting with each other via standard gluons in the @xmath2channel .",
    "although this simple structure must be modified at higher energies in order to introduce unitarization corrections , there is a window at present and future colliders where the bfkl predictions should hold .",
    "the leading logarithmic ( ll ) approximation in bfkl resums terms of the form @xmath3 to all orders .",
    "in such a limit diagrams contributing to the running of the strong coupling do not appear and @xmath4 remains as a constant free parameter . also the factor needed to scale the energy in the logarithms is not fixed ,",

    "the situation improves already in the next  to  leading logarithmic ( nll ) approximation where diagrams with an extra power in the coupling without introducing an extra logarithm in energy are taken into account . in this case",
    "the coupling is allowed to run and the energy scale is fixed .",
    "the calculation of the nll corrections to the bfkl equation was lengthy and completed in ref .",
    "it was needed to evaluate corrections to the gluon trajectory  @xcite and real emission kernel  @xcite , as well as to check that the bootstrap conditions are fulfilled in order to ensure that the complete set of nll contributions are indeed correctly resummed  @xcite .    lately , to be able to perform phenomenological studies , the nll calculation and numerical implementation of particular impact factors , describing the nature of the interaction between the reggeized gluons and the scattering particles for different physical processes , is a remaining challenge  @xcite .    in the construction of bfkl cross ",
    "sections the gluon green s function is the element carrying the energy dependence and therefore it deserves a careful study .",
    "there has been a lot of theoretical work trying to understand its structure which , since the appearance of the nll kernel , has revealed as quite non  trivial .",
    "it was shown in ref  @xcite that , in the transverse momentum space , the nll green s function presents some instability .",
    "the origin of this instability and more convergent kernels including renormalization  group ( rg ) generated terms were presented in ref .",

    "in order to do so , an approximation to the original @xmath0shift will be performed .",
    "it will be shown how this approximation is an accurate one and the corresponding expression in transverse momentum space very simple .",
    "the main feature of the new rg  improved kernel will be that it does not mix transverse with longitudinal momentum components . from the practical point of view",

    "is written in the @xmath12 renormalisation scheme . alternatively , as in other calculations where a resummation of soft gluons is involved , the gb scheme  @xcite can also be used : @xmath13 both schemes will be under analysis in this work .    as it is well  known the collinear structure of this kernel can be extracted by projecting it on the modified ll eigenfunctions @xmath14 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath15 note that the prefactor @xmath16 generates a nll term which makes the @xmath5representation of the kernel invariant under the @xmath17 transformation  @xcite .",
    "although @xmath18 breaks the scale invariance , for the collinear analysis of the kernel it is enough to work with the scale invariant pieces which , at ll and nll accuracy , read @xmath19 @xmath20 all these expressions are re  written here just to set the notation . @xmath21 and @xmath22 for future reference it is important to remark that the terms with second derivatives in the @xmath23 function directly stem from the double logarithm in eq .",
    "( [ ktkernel ] ) .",
    "the pole structure of this kernel around @xmath24 is as follows : @xmath25 the cubic poles come directly from @xmath26 and @xmath27 throughout this paper for numerical analysis the value @xmath28 will be taken .    in this @xmath5space representation",
    "it is known that the cubic poles do compensate for the equivalent terms appearing when the symmetric regge  like energy scale @xmath29 is shifted to the @xmath30 choice in dis  like processes . this compensation takes place at nll , the accuracy at which the bfkl kernel is known .",
    "it turns out that higher order terms beyond nll , not compatible with rg evolution , are also generated by this change of scale .",
    "the nll truncation of the perturbative expansion is then the reason why the gluon green s function in the bfkl formalism develops oscillations in the @xmath31 ratio when this ratio is very far from unity . along these oscillations",
    "the green s function can have negative values .    at present collider energies",
    "it remains to be seen how important these oscillations are when a full nll bfkl ",
    "resummed calculation of a physical cross section , including impact factors , is carried out .",
    "nevertheless there have been attempts in the literature to improve the behaviour of the bfkl resummation in the @xmath31 variable .",
    "one of the original proposals , the subject of the present analysis , shows how it is possible to remove the most dominant poles in @xmath5space incompatible with rg evolution by simply shifting the @xmath0pole present in the bfkl scale invariant eigenfunction .",
    "this shift has to be performed with care not to double count terms and to match the nll accuracy of the original bfkl calculation . in the present study the focus will be on the scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath32 by iterating this expression new terms beyond the original bfkl calculation appear improving the convergence in @xmath31 of the expansion .",
    "it is worth noting that the shift immediately resums these new terms to all orders in the coupling .",
    "therefore , any attempt to modify this approach should retain this feature .",
    "the main idea underlying the present analysis is that the numerical solution to the equation @xmath33 can be approximated remarkably well by the all  orders resummed expression @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bessel function of the first kind .    before showing the calculations leading to this formula the expression in eq .",

    "the values corresponding to the ll bfkl kernel are also included in the plot .",
    "the @xmath0shift removes the poles at @xmath24 and affects the saddle point region by reducing the ll intercept from about 0.55 at a fixed coupling of @xmath36 to a value close to 0.31 .",
    "the approximated value obtained from the expression containing @xmath37 is 0.35 .",
    "it will be shown below how this approximation to the shift is even more accurate when the full nll corrections are included .",
    "on the last plot of fig .",
    "[ simplefigure ] one can see that the approximation is a stable one under variations of the strong coupling values .    in the following the full nll scale invariant terms",
    "are taken into account .",
    "in general one can consider the @xmath0shift of the form @xmath38 it is convenient to use the following representation of the ll eigenvalue of the bfkl kernel in eq .",
    "( [ loeigen ] ) : @xmath39 this representation reveals the singularity structure of @xmath40 which has an infinite number of poles at the @xmath41 points along the real axis . in this way the general shift can be written as @xmath42 in those regions close to the @xmath43 poles a good approximation to eq .",
    "( [ generalshift ] ) is @xmath44 with the straightforward solution @xmath45 the same logic applies to the regions around the @xmath46 poles . in the following",
    "it will be shown how , to a very good accuracy , the solution to the shift in eq .",
    "( [ generalshift ] ) can be obtained by simply adding all the approximated solutions at the different poles plus a term related to the virtual contributions of the ll bfkl kernel , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath47 from now on this expression will be indicated as the `` all  poles '' approximation . in the region of interest , @xmath48 , eq .",
    "( [ assumption ] ) simplifies because @xmath49 and one can also introduce the all  orders expansion of the square roots : @xmath50 at the @xmath51 poles this expansion generates the nll terms : @xmath52 therefore , to match the original kernel at nll , it is needed to set @xmath53 and @xmath54 from eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) .    to demonstrate that this expansion improves the convergence of the bfkl calculation in the same way as the original @xmath0shift",
    ", it is needed to include the full nll scale invariant kernel without double counting terms , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath55 + \\left\\{\\gamma \\rightarrow 1-\\gamma\\right\\}\\right\\}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this way , as in the original @xmath0shift , the nll results are untouched and only higher order terms are added to the kernel .",
    "the extra terms being resummed to all orders in @xmath56 will be important to find a closed form for the kernel with corresponding eigenvalues as in eq .",
    "( [ all - poles ] ) .",
    "it turns out that when the matching to nll is performed the `` all  poles '' result reproduces the @xmath0shift very accurately . this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fullfigure1 ] where the full @xmath0shift and the `` all  poles '' kernel are compared , together with the ll and nll results which are also included . the fact that the imaginary part of @xmath5 at the maximum of the nll scale invariant eigenvalue ( middle plot of fig .",
    "[ fullfigure1 ] ) is not zero results in the oscillations in the @xmath31 variable .",
    "this feature is removed when the rg ",
    "improved kernel is used , as it also happens for the `` all  poles '' kernel .",
    "the estimated intercept from the @xmath0shift is of about 0.27 , while that coming from the `` all  poles '' kernel is 0.26 ( for @xmath36 ) .",
    "the similarity between the `` all  poles '' kernel and the original @xmath0shift remains for different values of the coupling ( see bottom plot of fig .  [ fullfigure1 ] ) .",
    "the most striking feature of eq .",
    "( [ all - poles ] ) is that the @xmath0space is decoupled from the @xmath5representation , _ i.e. _ they no longer mix as it occurs in the original @xmath0shift .",
    "this has the implication that it should be possible to find an expression for a rg  improved bfkl kernel which does not mix longitudinal with transverse degrees of freedom . to find such a kernel",
    "it is convenient to define the following function related to a simple representation of the ll kernel : @xmath57 keeping in mind the coefficients of the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ all - poles ] ) the following summation can be constructed : @xmath58 in order to include the @xmath59 case it is needed to add a term corresponding to the virtual contributions in the ll bfkl kernel , ensuring , in this way , the infrared finiteness of the final result , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath60 by introducing this extra @xmath59 piece it is then possible to resum the expansion in terms of a bessel function and eq .",
    "( [ almostbessel ] ) is equivalent to @xmath61 in order to match this expression to the nll bfkl formulation it is sufficient to perturbatively expand eq .",
    "( [ besselya ] ) up to order @xmath62 : @xmath63 it is important to note that this expression does not depend on the angle between the @xmath64 and @xmath65 two  dimensional vectors , therefore this scale invariant resummation can be directly added to the original nll bfkl kernel without having to angular average .",
    "the `` all  poles '' approximation only affects the zero conformal spin sector of the theory .",
    "this is particularly interesting for the study of final states where angular correlations are relevant .",
    "moreover , these new higher order terms do not affect the cancellation of infrared divergences in the original kernel .",
    "it is also noteworthy to point out how the perturbative expansion of the `` all  poles '' kernel naturally generates the double logarithm already present in the original bfkl kernel ( see eq .",
    "( [ ktkernel ] ) ) .",
    "what this resummation then achieves ( as in the original @xmath0shift ) is to resum to all orders those most dominant transverse logarithms which will make the expansion compatible with renormalization group evolution in the collinear and anticollinear limits relevant in dis  like configurations .    for the sake of clarity , the only modification needed in the full nll kernel to introduce the `` all  poles '' resummation is to remove the term @xmath66 in the real emission kernel , @xmath67 , and replace it with @xmath68 from the asymptotic behaviour of the bessel function , when the coupling is small and the difference between the @xmath69 and @xmath70 scales is not very large then @xmath71 and the influence of the `` all  poles '' resummation is minimal .",
    "therefore the `` regge  like '' region in momentum space is not largely affected .",
    "but when the logarithm in the ratio of transverse momenta becomes larger due to a larger difference between the scales entering the real production vertex , then the asymptotic behaviour develops the oscillatory form @xmath72 automatically compensating for the unphysical oscillations present in the original formulation of the nll bfkl equation .",
    "in this section the study of the effect of changing the renormalisation point , and using the gluon  bremsstrahlung ( gb ) instead of the @xmath6 scheme , is performed .",
    "this is equivalent to the following redefinition of the position of the landau pole : @xmath73 with this choice the coefficient for the double poles in the nll kernel does not change while the one for the simple poles now reads @xmath74 in fig .  [ fullfigure2 ]",
    "this gb scheme is under analysis .",
    "there it is shown how again the `` all  poles '' kernel is a very good approximation to the @xmath0shift . with a @xmath6 value of @xmath36 the corresponding coupling in gb scheme",
    "is @xmath75 .",
    "the value of the intercept at ll is of @xmath76 while the rg  improved prediction is of @xmath77 , which coincides with that steming from the `` all  poles '' analysis .",
    "it is clear that the influence of the choice of renormalisation scheme will be larger when the full kernel is introduced and running coupling effects are also taken into account .    as a final remark , if running coupling effects are to be included , it is interesting to note that eq .",
    "( [ ktkernel ] ) corresponds to an angular  averaged representation of the gluon regge trajectory and the real emission kernel .",
    "if this angular integration is not performed then the cancellation of infrared divergencies can be written as @xmath78 where the gluon regge trajectory in this regularization reads @xmath79 the constant of integration can be fixed to be @xmath80 from the first reference in  @xcite and @xmath81 is the so  called `` cusp anomalous dimension '' of ref .",
    "@xcite . in principle",
    "it is possible to use @xmath82 , multiply the nll equation by the extra logarithm and obtain the gluon green s function as the solution to a diferential equation in @xmath5representation .",
    "an alternative is to solve the equation as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the targets of the present paper is to show how it is possible to introduce a rg  improved kernel which still allows for an exact solution of the nll bfkl equation as that proposed in ref .",
    "the solution there calculated is based on the iteration of the bfkl equation for the partial wave expansion of the green s function .",
    "this iteration has a multiple pole structure in the complex @xmath0space which allows for a simple inversion back into energy space .",
    "this inversion using a mellin transform would not be possible if an extra @xmath0dependence in the kernel , as the one in the @xmath0shift , is present . in this context",
    "the prescription proposed here in eq .",
    "( [ presc1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ presc2 ] ) allows for a straightforward implementation of the rg improvements given that it just modifies the real emission part of the nll bfkl kernel without introducing any extra @xmath0dependence . therefore the iterative procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite remains valid .",
    "in particular , if a different choice for the argument in the running coupling is considered the method used in ref .",
    "@xcite always provides the exact solution .",
    "the study of all these effects at the level of the gluon green s function will be performed in a coming publication .",
    "the original analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite for the improvement of the convergence in transverse momentum space of the nll bfkl kernel is revisited .",
    "an intrinsic feature of such renormalization group improved kernels is that the variables mellin  conjugated of the energy and the transverse momenta , @xmath0 and @xmath5 respectively , do mix due to the so  called @xmath0shift .",
    "this makes the study of these schemes quite complicated . in the present work",
    "it is shown how it is possible to avoid the difficulties of the @xmath0shift without loosing the physical insight .",
    "this is done by approximating the solution to the original equation at each of the poles of the original kernel .",
    "the result in @xmath5representation is that of eq .",
    "( [ all - poles ] ) named as the `` all  poles '' resummation .",
    "it turns out that the corresponding scale invariant kernel in transverse momentum space with eigenvalue as in eq .",
    "( [ all - poles ] ) can be found and has a very simple form .",
    "its structure in terms of a bessel function of the first kind is shown in eq .",
    "( [ presc2 ] ) .",
    "the main feature of this kernel is that it only depends on transverse momenta and not on longitudinal degrees of freedom .",
    "this representation of the collinear improved kernels can be implemented immediately using the iterative approach described in ref .",
