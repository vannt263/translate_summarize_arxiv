    "the sunyaev  zeldovich ( sz ) effect is the inverse - compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons from the hot plasma within clusters of galaxies ( @xcite , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the surface brightness of an sz signal does not depend on the redshift @xmath25 of the cluster and the integrated signal is only weakly dependent on @xmath26 via the angular diameter distance .",
    "hence an sz - effect flux - density - limited survey can provide a complete catalogue of galaxy clusters above a limiting mass ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .    detecting and imaging the sz effect has gradually become routine since it was first securely detected by @xcite and first imaged by @xcite . until recently ,",
    "sz observations have been directed almost entirely towards clusters selected optically or in x - ray , for example with ami ( @xcite ) , amiba ( @xcite ) , apex ( @xcite ) , cbi ( @xcite ) , cbi-2 ( @xcite ) , ocra ( @xcite ) , ovro / bima ( @xcite ) , rt ( @xcite ) , suzie ( @xcite ) , sza ( @xcite ) and the vsa ( @xcite ) .",
    "now , however , sz blind surveying is underway , with act and spt having produced initial results ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) is conducting a blind cluster survey at 16ghz in twelve regions , each typically one deg@xmath11 , which contain no previously recorded clusters .",
    "the ami cluster survey focuses on depth , aiming to detect weak sz - effect signals from clusters of galaxies with a mass above @xmath27 @xmath28 2 @xmath1 @xmath29@xmath30 , where @xmath27 corresponds to the total cluster mass within a spherical volume such that the mean interior density is 200 times the mean density of the universe at the current epoch .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : obs_info ]",
    ", we give a brief description of the instrument , observations , data reduction and map making techniques . identifying cluster candidates",
    "is described in section [ sec : method ]  we stress that some readers will wish to jump to the start of section [ sec : method ] which is an important overview of the three analysis methods and of their assumptions .",
    "we discuss how we apply a bayesian analysis to the ami data in section [ sec : bayes ] and present the results in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we assume a concordance @xmath31cdm cosmology , with @xmath32 = 0.3 , @xmath33 = 0.7 and h@xmath34 = 70 kms@xmath35mpc@xmath35 .",
    "the dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath36 is defined as @xmath36 = h@xmath34/(70 kms@xmath35mpc@xmath35 ) .",
    "all coordinates are given at equinox j2000 .",
    "sited at the mullard radio astronomy observatory , cambridge ( @xmath37 above sea level ) , ami consists of a pair of aperture - synthesis interferometric arrays optimised for sz - effect imaging centred at 16ghz , with six frequency channels .",
    "the large array ( la ) has a high resolution and flux - density sensitivity and is used primarily to detect contaminating sources which can then be subtracted from the small array ( sa ) maps .",
    "ami is described in detail in @xcite and the technical aspects of the arrays are summarised in table [ ami_tech ] .",
    "the sa has been operating since 2005 ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and the la since 2008 ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ". pointed sz observations have been straightforward but for blind observations we have felt it essential to get the best control of systematics that we can  for example , we found hard - to - unravel problems with la pointing and errors in the electrical lengths of the lags in both the la and the sa fourier - transform correlators that produce small position shifts  we now have corrections for these problems that are adequate .",
    "we also have very good control over the influence of radio source contamination ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .    .ami technical summary .",
    "note that the brightness sensitivity is highly dependent on the weighting of the visibilities  in this table we assume natural weighting . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have looked for optical identification of the cluster in the palomar all - sky survey and x - ray identification from rosatr extraterrestrische physik ( mpe ) at garching , germany . ]",
    " no cluster identification is evident .",
    "we plan to perform x - ray and optical follow - up observations .",
    "* we have presented a large , complex sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich structure in an ami blind field .",
    "the structure may be two separate components or be a single merging system . * a bayesian analysis using a physical model for the cluster ( including assumed priors on the number density of clusters )",
    "was used to constrain cluster parameters such as @xmath38 and @xmath26 . using the bayesian evidences we have calculated formal probabilities of detection taking into account point sources , receiver noise and the statistical properties of the primary cmb anisotropy . for the deeper component",
    "we find a formal probability of detection ratio of 7.9 @xmath1 @xmath3:1 when assuming the @xcite cluster number count and 2.1 @xmath1 @xmath4:1 when assuming @xcite as the true prior .",
    "we derive a cluster mass of @xmath5@xmath1 @xmath39 . * a bayesian analysis using a phenomenological model of the gas distribution",
    "was also used to quantify the significance of the detection and again taking into account point sources , receiver noise and the statistical properties of the primary cmb anisotropy . for the deeper component",
    "we find @xmath40 . * in our pointed follow - up observation",
    "the cluster system is detected with a high significance , with each map indicating that there is a 0.6mjy / beam peak decrement ( @xmath41 ) towards the deeper component and an integrated decrement flux density ( @xmath42 ) of @xmath43 .",
    "the other component has a 0.5mjy peak decrement and an integrated decrement of 0.7mjy . * using the approximation",
    "@xmath44 we anticipate that the ami blind cluster survey will detect clusters with @xmath45 @xmath1 @xmath39 at @xmath46 .",
