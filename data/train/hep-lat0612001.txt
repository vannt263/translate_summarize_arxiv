    "lattice qcd has established the existence of a transition from hadron gas to a new state of strongly interacting matter where quarks and gluons are no longer confined inside hadrons and which is usually called the quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the nature of this transition depends on the quark content and quark masses . for infinite or very large quark masses",
    "the transition is a 1st order deconfining transition . in the opposite case of zero quark masses",
    "one may have a 2nd order chiral phase transition for 2 flavors or a 1st order chiral phase transition for 3 flavors . for intermediate masses",
    "the transition is just a rapid crossover , meaning that thermodynamic quantities change very rapidly in a narrow temperature interval .",
    "the boundary of the 1st order transition region of 3 flavor qcd as a function of mass has been studied using improved ( p4 ) @xcite and standard staggered actions @xcite .",
    "there is a significant discrepancy regarding the value of the quark masses , or equivalently the value of the pseudo - scalar meson masses where the transition changes from crossover to 1st order . with an improved action",
    "it was found that the 1st order transition ends for a pseudo - scalar meson mass of about @xmath4 mev , while with the standard action it ends for pseudo - scalar meson masses of about @xmath5 mev @xcite or larger @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the pressure and energy density normalized by its ideal gas value shows almost the same behavior as a function of @xmath6 for su(3 ) pure gauge theory , 2 flavor , 2 + 1 flavor and 3 flavor qcd @xcite .",
    "thus flavor and quark mass dependence of these quantities in the first approximation , is determined by flavor and quark mass dependence of transition temperature @xmath7 .",
    "therefore it is very instructive to study the flavor dependence of the transition temperature .",
    "such a study has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite on lattices with temporal extent @xmath0 using the improved staggered p4 action .    in the past most simulations with 2 and 3 flavors of staggered fermions",
    "have been done using the hybrid molecular dynamics r ( hmdr ) algorithm @xcite , often called simply the r - algorithm .",
    "it has finite step - size errors of @xmath8 where a step - size @xmath9 is used in the molecular dynamics evolution .",
    "recently the rational hybrid monte carlo ( rhmc ) algorithm has been invented which allows simulations of theories with fractional powers of the fermion determinant , for example 2 and 3 flavors of staggered fermions , without finite step - size errors @xcite .",
    "therefore the most recent thermodynamics studies use the rhmc algorithm @xcite .",
    "it has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the use of the exact rhmc algorithm reduces the value of the critical quark mass where the transition turns to 1st order by @xmath10 in the case of the standard staggered action .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first we would like to study the transition in 3 flavor qcd , extending the previous studies to smaller quark masses and smaller lattice spacings using the improved p4 staggered fermion action .",
    "second we would like to compare the r - algorithm with the new rhmc algorithm .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the calculational set - up . in section iii",
    "we show our results for finite temperature calculations .",
    "section iv discusses the zero temperature simulations needed to set the scale and the transition temperature in physical units . in section v we present a comparison of the r and rhmc algorithms .",
    "finally , section vi contains our conclusions . a technical discussion of different fat link actions is given in appendix a. in appendix",
    "b we discuss the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the p4 action in the free field limit .",
    "most of the simulations discussed in this paper were done using the p4fat3 action , which is also simply called the p4 action @xcite . to improve the rotational symmetry , which is violated on the lattice , bent 3-link terms are added to the 1-link term of the standard staggered action @xcite .",
    "properly chosen coefficients of the 1-link and the 3-link terms can eliminate , at tree level , the @xmath11 errors in the dispersion relation for staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "the violation of flavor symmetry which is present in the staggered fermion formulation can be significantly reduced by replacing the normal link in the 1-link term by a fat link which is a sum a of normal link and 3-link staples @xcite .",
    "this 3-link fattening is the origin of the name p4fat3 .",
    "though this type of fat link action is a big improvement over the standard staggered fermion action , further improvement of the flavor symmetry can be obtained by adding 5- and 7-link staples @xcite .",
    "in fact one can eliminate the effect of flavor symmetry breaking at order @xmath12 using a suitable combination of 3- , 5- and 7- link staples leading to what is called the fat7 action @xcite .",
    "we have also done calculations with the p4 action with fat7 fat links .",
    "unfortunately it turns out that on the coarse lattices used in our study of 3 flavor qcd thermodynamics this action has some undesirable features .",
    "it leads to the occurrence of a bulk transition , which we will discuss in more detail in appendix a.    to study staggered fermions with less than four flavors , we use the rooting procedure , i.e. each fermion flavor is represented by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the staggered fermion dirac operator .",
    "for a recent discussion of this procedure see ref .",
    "most of our simulations have been done using the standard r - algorithm @xcite . as in ref .",
    "@xcite the step - size of the molecular dynamics evolution was set to @xmath15 for the staggered quark mass @xmath16 .",
    "we also performed calculations with the rhmc algorithm . in this algorithm",
    "an optimal rational approximation is used to evaluate the fractional power of the determinant @xcite .",
    "more precisely one finds the optimal approximation for @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the usual staggered fermion matrix and for the three flavors @xmath19 .",
    "using sufficiently high order polynomials the rational approximation can be made arbitrarily precise for the given spectral range of the fermion operator .",
    "for the standard staggered fermion action the spectral range of @xmath20 is well known , the smallest eigenvalue of this matrix is @xmath21 .",
    "the largest eigenvalue can be estimated in the free field limit to be @xmath22 .",
    "for the case of the p4 staggered action the smallest eigenvalue is the same , while the largest eigenvalue in the free case is @xmath23 . in appendix",
    "b we give the derivation of this result .",
    "it turns out that in all our simulations the largest eigenvalue was smaller than 5.0 , so we choose @xmath24 as the upper limit on it . for the range of the quark masses studied by us , which include quark masses as light as 1/20th of the strange quark mass , it is sufficient to use polynomials of degree 12 to achieve machine precision with the rational approximation",
    ". therefore in the metropolis accept / reject step we used polynomials of degree 12 . in the molecular dynamics evolution",
    "we used a less stringent approximation of the determinant since any errors in the evolution , including the @xmath25 step - size errors , are eliminated by the accept / reject step .",
    "it has been found that in most cases it is sufficient to use polynomials of degree 5 - 6 without compromising the acceptance rate .",
    "furthermore , the stopping criteria for the conjugate gradient inversions can be relaxed to @xmath26 in the molecular dynamics evolution without significant effect on the acceptance rate . in the monte - carlo",
    "accept / reject step we typically use @xmath27 for the conjugate gradient stopping criteria .",
    "the length of the trajectory was @xmath28 in units of molecular dynamics time .",
    "the gauge fields and quarks contribute different amounts to the force in the molecular dynamics evolution .",
    "the contribution of the gauge fields is larger than that of quarks . on the other hand",
    "the cost of the evaluation of the force coming from the gauge fields is small .",
    "the opposite is true for the part of the force coming from the fermions .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to integrate the gauge force on finer molecular dynamics time scale than the fermion force @xcite . in our simulations",
    "we typically used 10 gauge field updates per fermion update .",
    "the 3 flavors of staggered fermions are simulated as 1 + 1 + 1 , i.e. we used a factor @xmath29 for each fermion flavor .",
    "although this increases the number of inversions , the reduced force allows for a larger step - size @xmath30 for the same acceptance rate .",
    "the step - size @xmath9 was chosen such that the acceptance is about @xmath31 . to achieve this ,",
    "the stepsize was typically of the order of the strange quark mass used in our 2 + 1 flavor study @xcite .    .",
    "parameters of the numerical simulations [ cols=\"^,>,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have studied the phase transition in 3 flavor qcd at finite temperature using @xmath0 and @xmath32 lattices . for the quark mass corresponding to the second order end - point",
    "we find the critical temperature to be @xmath2 .",
    "the transition temperature in the chiral limit is about @xmath33 smaller than the above value . for a given pseudo - scalar meson mass",
    "the difference between the transition temperature in 3 flavor and 2 + 1 flavor case is less than @xmath34 .",
    "we also find that the cut - off dependence of the transition temperature in 3 and 2 + 1 flavor qcd is very similar .",
    "furthermore , we find that finite step - size errors present in the r algorithm are negligible , at least for the p4fat3 action at the quark masses studied .",

    "the work of c.s . has been supported through ldrd funds from brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "the majority of the calculations reported here were carried out using the qcdoc supercomputers of the riken - bnl research center and the u.s .",
    "in addition some of the work was done using the ape1000 supercomputer at bielefeld university",
    "in this appendix we are going to discuss the properties of the finite temperature transition in the case of the p4fat7 action and compare it to the p4fat3 case .",
    "in general the gauge transporter in the 1-link term of the p4 action can be replaced by combination of the link variable and different staples , called the fat link , without changing the naive continuum limit .",
    "this is true provided the coefficient of different terms in the fat link satisfy appropriate normalization conditions .",
    "for example in the case of the fat link with the three link staple only , this condition reads @xmath35 . introducing five and seven link staples in addition to the three link staples",
    "give the so - called fat7 link @xcite . in this case",
    "the normalization condition reads : @xmath36 .",
    "it is possible to eliminate the leading order coupling to the high momentum gluons with momenta @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , i.e. to suppress the flavor changing interaction at order @xmath40 if the coefficients are chosen as @xcite @xmath41 this gives then the value @xmath42 for the coefficient of the 1- link term to get the naive continuum limit .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbpfta7 ] we show the chiral condensate calculated on the @xmath0 and @xmath32 lattices .",
    "we can see that for small quark masses the transition becomes strongly first order .",
    "the value of the chiral condensate in the low temperature phase is also much larger than for the p4fat3 action discussed in the main text . for the smallest quark mass",
    "the discontinuity in the chiral condensate is about the same for @xmath0 and @xmath32 lattice , although we would expect it to decrease by roughly a factor of @xmath43 when going from @xmath0 to @xmath32 .",
    "this could mean that we are dealing with a bulk transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig : betac ] we also compare the pseudo - critical couplings for the p4fat3 and p4fat7 actions .",
    "we see that for large quark masses the @xmath44 dependence of the pseudo - critical coupling is similar , though their values are significantly different . for small quark masses",
    "the pseudo - critical couplings calculated for @xmath0 and @xmath1 come very close together , again suggesting that the transition may be a bulk transition .",
    "we did calculations also on @xmath45 lattice at @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : betac ] we compare the chiral condensate calculated on @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath45 lattices .",
    "we see a sharp drop in the value of the chiral condensate , which occurs at the same @xmath49 for @xmath32 and @xmath50 .",
    "this again indicates a bulk transition .",
    "( left ) and @xmath32 ( right ) lattices for p4fat7 action.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   ( left ) and @xmath32 ( right ) lattices for p4fat7 action.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    one may wonder which feature of the p4fat7 action is responsible for the bulk transition .",
    "the main difference of the p4fat7 action compared to p4fat3 action as well as to other fat link action ( e.g. asqtad ) is the negative sign of the one link term .",
    "close to the continuum limit the normalization condition @xmath51 should insure that the combination of 1- , 3- , 5- and 7-link terms will describe a conventionally normalized , positive dirac kinetic energy . however , at stronger coupling where the gauge field are more disordered , the staples with many links are expected to give a significantly smaller contribution and the 1-link term may dominate , resulting in an effective kinetic energy term with a possibly negative sign . while this would simply correspond to non - standard sign and normalization conventions for the dirac kinetic energy , it raises the possibility that this effective kinetic energy term will change sign as one passes from strong to weak coupling .",
    "such a sign change could induce a bulk transition .",
    "in addition , the change in magnitude of the coefficient in the effective kinetic energy ( small for strong coupling and large for weak coupling ) would appear reversed in the chiral condensate ( large for strong coupling and small for weak coupling ) consistent with the observed behavior . to verify this we did calculations with p4fat7 action but with different coefficients which we call the p4fat7 action .",
    "the coefficients were chosen to be @xmath52 for this action we found no evidence for a strong first order transition but only a crossover .",
    "this can be seen for example in the behavior of the chiral condensate shown in fig .",
