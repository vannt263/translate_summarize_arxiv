    "recently , a new framework for dark - matter physics has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "this new framework is called `` dynamical dark matter '' ( ddm ) , and previous discussions of ddm have focused on its overall theoretical properties  @xcite as well as on the theoretical and phenomenological implications of a specific model  @xcite that was constructed within this new framework . in this paper , we shall return to consideration of the general ddm framework as a whole , and discuss the detection prospects for a broad class of ddm models at colliders , and in particular at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the central hallmark of the dynamical dark - matter framework is that the dark sector consists not of one ( or merely a few ) stable dark - matter particles , but rather an _ ensemble _ of constituents which act collectively in ways that transcend the physics normally associated with more traditional dark sectors .",
    "such a ddm ensemble is not randomly assembled , but instead has certain internal structures which guarantee its phenomenological viability .",
    "for example , stability on cosmological time scales  normally considered to be a sacrosanct property for traditional dark - matter candidates  is not a requirement for such an ensemble .",
    "instead , lifetimes are balanced against cosmological abundances across the different constituents of this ensemble in such a way that those components with larger decay widths ( and consequently shorter lifetimes ) necessarily have smaller cosmological abundances , and vice versa . indeed , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , this balancing represents a novel way of satisfying phenomenological bounds on the dark sector without imposing stability as a whole , and ultimately represents the most general dark sector that can be imagined .",
    "most traditional dark - matter candidates can be characterized in terms of their masses and couplings to standard - model ( sm ) states , and indeed most phenomenological bounds in the dark - matter literature are phrased in terms of constraints on these variables  @xcite . by contrast , in the ddm framework the dark - matter `` candidate '' is the entire ensemble , and the parameters which ultimately characterize a ddm ensemble describe not only the couplings of its individual constituents to sm states , but also the internal structure of the ensemble itself . in general , such an internal structure might consist of relationships between the masses , relic abundances , and couplings of its components . as a result ,",
    "the natural parameters which characterize ddm models and their phenomenology are fundamentally different from those which suffice to describe traditional dark - matter candidates .",
    "indeed , the most fundamental parameters which characterize a ddm ensemble are those which describe how quantities such as the constituent - particle masses , abundances , decay widths , and cross - sections scale with respect to one another across the ensemble as a whole .",
    "this clearly represents a new way of thinking about a dark sector , but the need for such an approach is one of the primary features of the ddm framework .    in this paper",
    ", we shall focus on the implications of these fundamental differences for the collider phenomenology of ddm ensembles , and in particular for their discovery potential at the lhc .",
    "the canonical channels in which one generally expects to obtain evidence for a ddm ensemble involve substantial missing transverse energy ( hereafter denoted @xmath0 )  just as is the case for a traditional dark - matter candidate .",
    "it is therefore crucial to develop strategies for distinguishing between these two classes of models once an excess in one or more of these @xmath0 channels has been identified .",
    "one such strategy , which was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is to search for correlations between @xmath0 signatures and signals in other channels to which the ddm ensemble might simultaneously give rise  channels not normally associated with dark matter .",
    "indeed , in ddm models , only those portions of the ddm ensemble which are stable on collider time scales contribute to missing - energy signals at colliders .",
    "by contrast , it is possible that other portions of the ddm ensemble will have much shorter lifetimes and therefore manifest themselves in different channels entirely  channels that may not involve @xmath0 whatsoever . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a wide variety of ddm scenarios generically give rise to observable excesses in both classes of channels simultaneously",
    ". however , in a variety of other ddm contexts , such correlations among channels may not be possible due to the particulars of the model and the lifetimes of the constituent fields in the ensemble .",
    "in such contexts  and especially when those constituent fields manifest themselves only through @xmath0 signatures  alternative strategies for identifying ddm ensembles are necessary .",
    "such alternative strategies will be the primary focus of this paper .",
    "in particular , one of our central aims is to demonstrate that in many cases it is possible to distinguish ddm ensembles from more traditional dark - matter candidates based solely on results from channels in which the dark - matter particles manifest themselves as @xmath0 alone .",
    "for example , the invariant - mass distributions of sm states produced in association with the constituent fields in a ddm ensemble by the decays of heavy particles can exhibit qualitative features which transcend those usually associated with traditional dark - matter candidates . as we shall see , such invariant - mass distributions",
    "can therefore provide a powerful experimental discriminant between ddm ensembles and these traditional candidates .",
    "furthermore , because this technique relies solely on signatures in detection channels in which the component fields of the ddm ensemble appear as @xmath0 , these signatures are insensitive to the precise lifetimes of any component fields which leave an imprint on the invariant - mass distribution in question .",
    "hence , they are likewise insensitive to the characteristic instability of the ddm ensemble as a whole , and this remains true provided that these fields are all sufficiently long - lived so as not to decay within the detector volume .",
    "these aspects of our discussion therefore have a broad applicability even beyond the context of the ddm framework , and apply quite generally to any multi - component dark - matter scenario involving an additional heavy `` parent '' particle which decays to final states involving the dark - sector fields , or to any scenario involving multiple metastable neutral fields and such a parent particle .    in order to explicitly illustrate these themes , in this paper we shall consider the case in which each parent particle decays directly to a single constituent field within the ddm ensemble along with a pair of strongly - interacting sm particles ( , quarks or gluons ) . even in this simplest non - trivial case",
    ", we shall demonstrate that there exist a range of characteristic features which are imprinted on the invariant - mass distribution of the two resulting jets and which can permit one to distinguish a ddm ensemble from any traditional dark - matter candidate .",
    "moreover , we shall show that there exist production mechanisms for the parent particles ( such as pair - production via strong interactions ) with event rates sufficient to enable such a differentiation at the @xmath1 significance level within the first @xmath2 of integrated luminosity at the @xmath3  tev lhc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : production ] , we outline the general aspects of the collider phenomenology of ddm ensembles and discuss the strategies for indirectly observing those ensembles in different classes of ddm models from the perspective of effective - operator analysis . in doing so ,",
    "we devote particular attention to models in which the component particles in the ddm ensemble are produced via the decays of a heavy parent particle . in sect .",
    "[ sec : mijdistributions ] , we calculate the invariant - mass distributions associated with pairs of sm states produced in conjunction with each dark - matter particle via this mechanism and compare them to the invariant - mass distributions obtained in theories involving only a single particle stable on collider time scales . in sect .",
    "[ sec : significances ] , we assess the statistical significance with which such non - traditional invariant - mass distributions can be distinguished from those in more traditional dark - matter models . in sect",
    "[ sec : productionchannels ] , we provide an example of one production mechanism which naturally provides event rates of the order required for such a differentiation within the first @xmath2 of integrated luminosity at the @xmath4  tev lhc  namely , the pair - production of strongly - interacting parent particles with masses near the tev scale . finally , in sect  [ sec : conclusions ] , we provide an assessment of how various subtleties associated with certain production mechanisms for the parent particle ( such as the combinatorial background associated with incorrect pairings of final - state jets for processes which yield more than one such parent particle per event ) are expected to impact our results",
    ". we also comment on the broader applicability of our results to scenarios outside the ddm framework .",
    "one of the hallmarks of the ddm framework is that the dark sector consists of an ensemble of particles @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , with @xmath7 presumed to be relatively large , , @xmath8 . for convenience",
    ", we shall label these particles in order of increasing mass , , @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , these particles @xmath5 exhibit a broad spectrum of decay widths @xmath10 which scale inversely with their corresponding cosmological abundances @xmath11 . as a result of these different decay widths , different @xmath5 may manifest themselves in qualitatively different ways at colliders  even in situations in which the @xmath5 all have similar quantum numbers and are therefore produced via similar processes .",
    "those @xmath5 with lifetimes @xmath12  s are stable on collider time scales and appear in a collider detector as @xmath0 .",
    "by contrast , any of the @xmath5 with lifetimes @xmath13  s decay within the detector volume . provided these rapidly - decaying @xmath5 decay predominately to final states involving sm particles , evidence for a ddm ensemble could potentially be obtained via the observation of signals in complementary channels which individually provide evidence for @xmath5 within either of these @xmath14 regimes .",
    "such signatures are discussed in ref .",
    "however , for models in which @xmath12  s for all @xmath5  or for models in which the @xmath5 that decay within the detector volume are not collectively produced at rates sufficient to yield observable effects at colliders  such multi - channel correlation techniques are not useful . in such cases , alternative strategies must be found for distinguishing ddm models from more traditional dark - matter models .    in this paper",
    ", we will examine one such strategy , which is applicable to a broad class of ddm models possessing two key characteristics .",
    "first , in addition to the constituent fields @xmath5 of the ddm ensemble , the field content of the model must include one or more heavy particles @xmath15 which can be produced at a substantial rate at a hadron collider .",
    "for example , if the @xmath15 transform non - trivially under the sm @xmath16 gauge group , they can be produced copiously via their interactions with the quark and gluon fields .",
    "second , these additional , heavy particles must decay with a sizeable branching fraction into final states including at least two sm fields , along with one or more of the @xmath5 .",
    "decay topologies of this sort arise generically , for example , in a specific class of ddm scenarios in which both the parent particle @xmath15 and the constituents of the ddm ensemble are charged under an approximate symmetry .",
    "however , in such cases it is an important property of the general ddm framework that such a symmetry is neither required nor need be preserved exactly .",
    "therefore , the ensemble constituents need not ultimately be stable",
    ".    we shall demonstrate that it is possible to differentiate between traditional , single - particle models of dark matter and multi - component scenarios , such as those which arise in the ddm framework , by examining the invariant - mass distributions of the sm fields produced by @xmath15 decays .",
    "of course , in cases in which only a small number of the @xmath5 are kinematically accessible in @xmath15 decays , these invariant - mass distributions are distinguished by the presence of multiple kinematic edges .",
    "note that similar features arise in other contexts as well , most notably that in which a parent particle can decay into final states involving different _ multiplicities _ of the same stable dark - matter particle  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in cases in which the number of kinematically - accessible @xmath5 is large and the decay phenomenology of the @xmath15 particles depends more sensitively on the full structure of the ddm ensemble , qualitatively different features emerge .",
    "in particular , while individual kinematic edges are no longer manifest , the invariant - mass distributions can exhibit distinctive shapes not realized in single - particle dark - matter scenarios .",
    "these distributions can therefore provide a powerful experimental discriminant between ddm ensembles and more traditional dark - matter candidates .",
    "we note that the technique described above has a broad range of applicability because it is not predicated on the observation of signals of both collider - stable and promptly - decaying @xmath5 , but rather of collider - stable fields alone .",
    "moreover , for the same reason , this technique can also be applied more broadly to a wide variety of multi - component dark - matter models , or to other scenarios which involve multiple particles which are stable on collider time scales .",
    "such situations can arise in certain limits of traditional dark - matter scenarios in which the dark - matter candidate is stabilized by a parity symmetry such as @xmath17-parity in supersymmetric models or kk parity  @xcite in higher - dimensional theories in which the sm propagates in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "for example , while only the lightest parity - odd particle is absolutely stable in such scenarios , situations can arise in which the decay rates of heavier parity - odd particles with similar quantum numbers are suppressed ( either by kinematics or by some additional consideration ) to such an extent that they are also stable on collider time scales .",
    "in such cases , the invariant - mass distributions associated with the decays of even heavier fields in the theory include contributions from final states involving _ all _ such stable or metastable particles .",
    "these distributions can therefore yield valuable information about the overall coupling structure and mass spectrum of the theory .    in order to analyze the collider phenomenology of ddm ensembles ,",
    "it is first necessary to characterize the properties of such dark - matter candidates in a straightforward and physically meaningful manner .",
    "indeed , a ddm ensemble is not a single particle or a small group of particles , but rather a vast collection of individual states whose collective properties dictate the dark - matter phenomenology of the model . taken together ,",
    "therefore , an ensemble of such states constitutes a dark - matter candidate which can not be characterized in terms of a single well - defined mass , decay width , or set of cross - sections for processes involving sm fields .",
    "instead , a ddm ensemble is more aptly characterized by parameters which describe its aggregate internal structure .",
    "such parameters may include , for example , scaling exponents in certain relations between masses and cross - sections , or between cosmological abundances and decay widths , that hold across the ddm ensemble as a whole . more specifically ,",
    "one natural set of such parameters might include the density of states expressed as a function of the masses @xmath18 of the @xmath5 , and a set of exponents which describe the scaling behavior of the couplings of the @xmath5 to other fields present in the theory .    in any arbitrary ddm model , such couplings can be described by a set of operators @xmath19 , where the indices @xmath20 indicate the dark - sector fields @xmath21 involved and where the index @xmath22 labels the operator in question .",
    "we shall let @xmath23 denote the mass dimension of the operator @xmath19 .",
    "we shall assume for the sake of simplicity in what follows that the only @xmath19 which play a meaningful role in the collider phenomenology of the ddm ensemble are members of the subset @xmath24 of operators which involve only a single @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore have an effective interaction lagrangian of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cutoff scale of the effective theory , and where @xmath27 is the dimensionless operator coefficient associated with @xmath24 . in addition , we shall also assume that all the constituent particles in the ensemble have the same quantum numbers , and thus that the set of @xmath24 consistent with the symmetries of the theory shares a common operator structure for all @xmath28 .",
    "in other words , for any given @xmath22 , the only @xmath28-dependence appears in the mass @xmath18 of the field @xmath5 and the coefficient @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the distribution of @xmath27 across the ensemble depends solely on @xmath18 , and that both this distribution and the mass spectrum of the ensemble exhibit general scaling relations of the form @xmath29 where the ( positive ) mass - splitting parameter @xmath30 and the scaling exponents @xmath31 and @xmath32 are free parameters .",
    "note that @xmath33 by construction .",
    "all of these assumptions can , of course , be relaxed ; however , the qualitative results obtained below still continue to hold in more general cases as well .",
    "note that the @xmath24 are ultimately responsible both for the production of the @xmath5 at colliders , and for their decay phenomenology  both in terms of their lifetimes @xmath14 and in terms of their decay products .",
    "of course the @xmath24 which play a dominant role in the production of the @xmath5 need not be the same as those which play a dominant role in determining their decay properties .    in this paper",
    "we shall focus primarily on the @xmath5 which are stable on collider time scales , as discussed above ; hence our primary concern in what follows will be with production rather than decay .",
    "in fact , given the scaling relations and parameterizations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : efflagrangian ] ) and  ( [ eq : massandcouplingscalings ] ) , we can now characterize precisely which components of a given ddm ensemble contribute to @xmath0 signals once produced . assuming that a given @xmath5 decays primarily to final states comprising sm fields the sum of whose masses is much smaller than @xmath18 ,",
    "we find that @xmath10 scales roughly like @xmath34 as discussed above , the distribution of @xmath10 across the ddm ensemble has a significant impact not only on the cosmological aspects of that ensemble , but on its collider phenomenology as well .",
    "when the lifetime @xmath35 of the particle is short on collider time scales ( @xmath36  s ) , the particle decays promptly within the detector .",
    "when the lifetime is long ( @xmath12  s ) , the particle decays outside the detector and appears as @xmath0 . in the intermediate region ( @xmath37 ) , the particle may give rise to a displaced vertex .",
    "thus @xmath5 within different ranges of @xmath18 in the ensemble may manifest themselves either as @xmath0 or via their decay products , depending on the value of @xmath10 .",
    "for example , in the case in which a single operator @xmath24 governs the decay width of all relevant @xmath5 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : massandcouplingscalings ] ) and  ( [ eq : decayrateschematic ] ) together imply that the requirement for appearing as @xmath0 is @xmath38 where @xmath32 here denotes the particular scaling exponent associated with the operator which effectively controls the decay width of @xmath5 , and @xmath39 is the decay width of the lightest state in the ensemble .",
    "by and large , when a dark - sector field is produced at the lhc via the decay of a heavy parent particle @xmath15 , multiple sm fields can also be produced via the same decay .",
    "one useful variable that can assist in distinguishing models involving a single dark - matter candidate from those involving more complicated dark sectors in scenarios of this sort is the invariant mass of the additional sm particles produced by decays of the parent particle .",
    "the identification of features in invariant - mass distributions has been shown to be effective in differentiating between the different symmetries which might stabilize a dark - matter particle in traditional dark - matter models  @xcite . in this paper , we show that it is also effective in distinguishing between traditional and ddm dark sectors .    for purposes of illustration , we focus on the case in which each @xmath15 decay yields two sm particles and a single @xmath5 . indeed ,",
    "this is the simplest case in which a non - trivial invariant - mass distribution is obtained for the sm particles from the decay of a single @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , since strongly - interacting particles can be produced copiously at colliders , we shall focus on the case in which @xmath15 carries @xmath16 charge and decays to a pair of sm quarks or gluons which form hadronic jets , and the relevant kinematic variable is the invariant mass @xmath40 of the two jets thus produced .",
    "we assume that each @xmath15 decays primarily via three - body processes of the form @xmath41 .",
    "we discuss the alternative possibility in which @xmath15 decays to the same final state through cascade decays involving a on - shell intermediary in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . finally , we assume here for simplicity that the pair of final - state jets produced via the decay of each particular @xmath15 can be correctly identified in each event .",
    "such an identification is trivial in situations such as those in which @xmath15 is produced singly or in which there exist other decay channels for @xmath15 with branching fractions similar to @xmath42 whose decay products are readily distinguishable from jets .",
    "however , if no such alternative decay channels exist  , if decays of the form @xmath43 dominate the width of @xmath15  the analysis becomes significantly more complex because of the non - trivial combinatorial issues which arise due to the possibility of incorrect pairings among the final - state jets . however , a number of techniques have been developed which can assist in identifying the correct jet pairings in such situations .",
    "we shall discuss these techniques , and the effect of combinatorial issues in general , in more detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we begin our analysis of the invariant - mass distributions which arise in the context of the ddm framework by briefly reviewing the characteristics of the corresponding distributions which arise in traditional dark - matter models .",
    "this will be important for purposes of comparison when we consider the contrasting case of a full ddm ensemble . towards this end , let us consider a traditional dark - matter model in which a parent particle @xmath15 likewise decays predominately into a three - body final state comprising a dark - matter particle @xmath44 and a pair of strongly - interacting sm fields ( either quarks or gluons ) .",
    "the latter appear in the detector as hadronic jets , here labeled @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "irrespective of the lorentz or @xmath16 representations of these fields , the differential partial width @xmath47 associated with this decay channel is given by the general three - body decay - width formula @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the matrix element for the parton - level process ( averaged over the spin and color states of @xmath15 ) , @xmath40 is the invariant mass of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and @xmath50 is the invariant mass of @xmath46 and @xmath44 . the normalized invariant - mass distribution associated with these decays is therefore given by @xmath51 where the limits of integration are @xmath52\\ ] ] in the limit that parton masses can be neglected .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : invtmassdistnormalized ] ) vanishes for @xmath53 and for @xmath54 .",
    "the explicit form of the @xmath40 distribution which arises in any particular model depends on the coupling structure between @xmath15 , @xmath44 , and the sm quark or gluon fields . as a concrete example ,",
    "let us consider the case in which @xmath44 and @xmath15 are both fermions , and @xmath15 transforms in the octet representation of @xmath16 , while @xmath44 is neutral under all sm symmetries . in this case",

    "[ fig : stddmmijcurves ] , we display the @xmath40 distributions obtained in this case for @xmath63  gev and several different choices of @xmath64 .",
    "note that each distribution shown features a characteristic mass edge at the kinematic endpoint @xmath65 , which differs for each @xmath64 .",

    "we now consider how the decay phenomenology of @xmath15 in the context of the ddm framework differs from that associated with the traditional dark - matter scenarios discussed above . as we shall see ,",
    "while each individual constituent @xmath5 in the ddm ensemble contributes to the width of @xmath15 and to the overall @xmath40 distribution in a manner analogous to a traditional dark - matter candidate , the collective behavior of these @xmath5 gives rise to distinctly new phenomena .",

    "for example , @xmath15 may be produced singly or have competing decays . moreover , even in situations in which @xmath15 decays predominately via parton - level processes of the form @xmath207 , heavy - flavor tagging could assist in the identification of the correct pairings in events in which one parent particle decays to a final state involving light quarks and the other to a final state involving heavy quarks , , @xmath208 . in many situations ,",
    "however , it is not possible to identify the correct pairing of final - state jets based on the properties of the jets alone , and incorrect jet pairings give rise to a substantial combinatorial background .",
    "nevertheless , a number of techniques exist for eliminating this combinatorial background .",
    "these include the hemisphere method  @xcite , the use of additional kinematic variables such as @xmath209  @xcite , and background - subtraction strategies  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it would be interesting to assess the relative efficacy of these techniques in helping to discriminate between ddm models and more traditional dark - matter scenarios in the presence of combinatorial ambiguities  @xcite .",
    "we note that we have chosen to focus on the case in which the sm particles produced alongside the @xmath5 by @xmath15 decays are quarks or gluons solely because large event rates can generically be expected for strongly - interacting @xmath15 .",
    "however , the techniques that we have developed here can also be applied to situations in which @xmath15 decays to final states involving different combinations of sm particles as well .",
    "for example , the prospects for differentiating between ddm scenarios and traditional dark - matter models obtained for decay topologies such as @xmath210 , where @xmath211 denotes a charged lepton , will be identical to those obtained for @xmath41 , given the same total number of events @xmath135 .",
    "we also note that the techniques outlined here for differentiating between ddm ensembles and more traditional dark - matter candidates also have a range of applicability that extends beyond the ddm framework .",
    "indeed , not every particle which manifests itself as @xmath0 at colliders necessarily contributes significantly ( or at all ) to @xmath205 , and @xmath0 signatures of this sort can arise in a number of theories involving multiple neutral particles which are stable on collider time scales but not necessarily stable on time scales approaching the age of the universe . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : production ] , examples of such theories can be found among supersymmetric models with highly compressed spectra  @xcite , scenarios involving universal extra dimensions  @xcite , and a wide variety of additional extensions of the sm .",
    "finally , we note that in this paper we have focused on the case in which @xmath15 decays to a final state consisting of sm states and one or more of the @xmath5 directly , via an effective multi - body interaction vertex .",
    "alternatively , one could also consider the situation in which @xmath15 decays to such a final state primarily via decay chains involving on - shell intermediate states . indeed ,",
    "the kinematic distributions associated with the final - state sm fields in this latter case differ significantly from those obtained in the former .",
    "for example , in traditional dark - matter models , the @xmath40 distributions associated with @xmath212 processes which proceed via cascade decays involving an on - shell intermediary take a characteristic triangular shape .",
    "it would be interesting to examine the corresponding @xmath40 distributions which arise for ddm ensembles , and whether such dark - matter candidates can likewise conclusively be distinguished from traditional dark - matter candidates on the basis of these distributions  @xcite .",
