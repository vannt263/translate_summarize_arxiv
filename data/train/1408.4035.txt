    "ii  peg is a k2iv , rs cvn binary star with @xmath0=4750 k and @xmath1=6.72 days @xcite .",
    "it is known to be very active and that is why we included it in our pilot survey where we tried to detect linear polarization in a small sample of cool stars at a level sufficient for imaging @xcite .",
    "the survey was successful and we have managed to obtain two sets of observations of ii  peg with sufficient phase coverage for zeeman doppler imaging ( zdi ) .",
    "the first set contains 7 observations performed between 25 september - 1 october 2012 and the second set consists of 12 observations obtained during 15 june - 1 july 2013 .",
    "all observations were made at the canada - france - hawaii telescope with the spectropolarimeter espadons @xcite which has a resolving power of about 65000 and a wavelength coverage 370 - 1050 nm . we were not able to detect any linear polarization signatures in individual spectral lines and therefore applied the multi - line technique least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ) @xcite to increase the s / n . in order for lsd to be applicable ,",
    "all lines are assumed to be scaled versions of some mean profile .",
    "the traditional approach of using lsd profiles for zdi is to assume the observed lsd profiles behave like a real spectral line .",
    "the lsd profile is assigned some mean line parameters and is thereafter treated as a single line with those parameters .",
    "local single line profiles are calculated using these mean line parameters , and are then integrated over the stellar disk .",
    "the disk - integrated profiles are then compared to the observed lsd profiles .    a conceptual weakness of this approach concerns the fact that an lsd profile is an average over thousands of spectral lines .",
    "in general , its behavior can not be accurately reproduced with a single spectral line as demonstrated by @xcite . in their study",
    "they showed that the single - line approximation requires fields below about 2  kg for stokes @xmath2 and that it can not reproduce stokes @xmath3 profiles at all .",
    "since we have stokes @xmath3 observations we are using a new approach to lsd profile modeling @xcite . a grid of synthetic lsd profiles is calculated from full polarized synthetic spectra covering the entire espadons wavelength range where each profile corresponds to a different temperature , magnetic field strength , limb angle and magnetic field vector orientation .",
    "the local lsd profiles are obtained by an interpolation in this grid .",
    "these local profiles are then integrated over the disk into single lsd profiles which are compared to the observed lsd profiles .",
    "no assumptions are made about the behavior of the lsd profiles and they are used only to compress information and compare with observations . using this approach , all four stokes parameters can be interpreted regardless of magnetic field strength .",
    "in fig .  [ sep12_lines ] and",
    "[ sum13_lines ] the observed line profiles from the two observing periods are plotted together with the model profiles .",
    "these figures also show the corresponding reconstructed temperature and magnetic field maps using either stokes @xmath2 or stokes @xmath4 profile timeseries .",
    "the observed line profiles show that the activity seems to have been continuously high throughout both observing epochs .",
    "the difference in profile shape from one observing period to the other suggests the magnetic field has evolved during this time . when only stokes @xmath2 are used to reconstruct the magnetic field , the corresponding stokes @xmath3 model profiles of that magnetic map",
    "do not match the observed stokes @xmath3 profiles .",
    "however , when linear polarization is taken into account in the reconstruction process , the derived model profiles agree well with the observed stokes @xmath3 profiles .",
    "the influence of including stokes @xmath3 profiles in the inversion is reflected directly in the structure of the recovered map .",
    "when all four stokes parameters are used , stronger features of the magnetic field become visible and the overall topology is more complex compared to when only stokes @xmath2 is used .",
    "this means that the same set of observed stokes @xmath5 profiles can be fit by various different magnetic field distributions .",
    "it also suggests that stokes @xmath5 alone can only , at best , give a rough overall picture of the complex magnetic field topologies of cool stars .",

    "<S> magnetic fields in cool stars are ubiquitous but can still be challenging to characterize due to their complexity and relatively low strength . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization signature amplitudes are proportional to the field strength , and current studies of cool star magnetic fields are using circular polarization only since linear polarization is even weaker . however , circular polarization is only sensitive to the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field , meaning that many structural features are not recovered or may be misinterpreted when only circular polarization is used for reconstruction of stellar magnetic topologies . </S>",
    "<S> linear polarization , on the other hand , is sensitive to the transverse component of the magnetic field and would provide a more complete picture of the magnetic field topology if combined with circular polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified the first cool target , the rs cvn star ii  peg , suitable for full stokes vector analysis . </S>",
    "<S> using current instrumentation , we have succeeded in systematically detecting its linear polarization signatures with a precision and rotational phase coverage sufficient for magnetic mapping . here we present the very first temperature and magnetic field maps reconstructed for a cool star using all four stokes parameter spectra . </S>"
