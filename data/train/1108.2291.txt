    "one - dimensional markov processes ( such as random walks or brownian motion ) conditioned not to intersect form an important class of models which arise in the study of random matrix theory , growth processes , directed polymers , tilings and certain problems in combinatorics and representation theory ( see the surveys @xcite ) .",
    "the probability distribution for these collections of lines may be analysed using a technique which exploits the non - intersection property : in different guises this tool is the karlin - mcgregor formula , the lingstrom - gessel - viennot formula , and the physics method of free fermions .",
    "these methods yield exact expressions ( as determinants ) for the statistics of such conditioned processes .",
    "asymptotic analysis then gives rise to certain universal scaling limits in the sense of convergence of finite - dimensional distributions and accordingly provides exact expressions for these distributions .",
    "striking examples of this are the works of @xcite which give limit theorems for the finite - dimensional distribution of the fluctuations of the height functions for the polynuclear growth ( png ) model in terms of fredholm determinants involving the extended @xmath15 kernel ( see also @xcite ) . using exactly solvable methods , @xcite further proved a functional limit theorem and established the existence of a continuous version of a stochastic process with the above family of finite - dimensional distributions which is known as the airy ( or sometimes @xmath15 ) process .",
    "such scaling limits have often been studied by analysing exact ( and often determinantal ) formulas for finite - dimensional distributions and correlation functions .",
    "it is natural to think that such canonical random processes might also be studied by probabilistic techniques ; and this study seems all the more warranted in light of the numerous significant questions about these limiting processes which have remained unanswered by the existing approaches . in this paper",
    ", we begin such a probabilistic study and solve a number of these open questions .",
    "the main tool which we will employ is the notion of a _",
    "gibbs property_. let us illustrate this idea in an informal way , so as to avoid introducing unnecessary notation ( the specific _ brownian gibbs property _ which we will use is given explicitly in definition [ maindefbgp ] ) . in studying random processes ( or fields ) @xmath16 from @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 may be taken to be a discrete lattice , graph , or euclidean space ) , it is natural to consider the conditional distribution of @xmath16 inside a compact subset @xmath19 of @xmath18 , given its values on @xmath20 .",
    "there is a class of such processes with the property that these distributions depend only on the values of @xmath16 on the boundary of @xmath19 ( in the discrete case , we mean the exterior boundary ) .",
    "furthermore , given these values , the distribution of @xmath16 on @xmath19 is determined relative to a reference measure in terms of a radon nikodym derivative which is often written in terms of a hamiltonian , and which is measurable with respect to the sigma - field generated by @xmath16 on @xmath19 and its ( exterior ) boundary .",
    "this property , which is often called the gibbs property , may be regarded as a spatial version of the markov property .",
    "gibbs properties for random lattice indexed fields are ubiquitous in models of statistical physics ( for instance , in ising or potts models ) and have received extensive treatment since the seminal work of dobrushin @xcite .",
    "we dispense with generalities and focus on a simple , though highly relevant , example of the gibbs property .",
    "fix @xmath21 and let @xmath22 \\to { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{z}}}\\}_{k=1}^{n}$ ] denote a system of @xmath0 simple symmetric random walks ( starting at time @xmath23 and ending at time @xmath24 ) whose starting and ending points satisfy @xmath25 , and which are conditioned on the non - intersection requirement that @xmath26 for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "fix two integers @xmath29 and a line index @xmath30 . then , conditioned on the values of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 , the law of @xmath35 is uniform over the set of simple random walk paths of length @xmath36 between @xmath31 and @xmath32 that intersect neither @xmath37 nor @xmath38 .",
    "( if @xmath39 , there is only one path to be avoided . ) in other words , the line ensemble measure is invariant under resampling according to the usual random walk measure subject to the non - intersection condition .",
    "the continuum counterpart of this system is a variant of dyson s brownian motion given by several brownian bridges conditioned not to intersect .",
    "the resampling property has an analogue as well : the rule is the same , except that the underlying measure is now an independent system of brownian bridges between the given endpoints , rather than the uniform law on simple random walk paths .",
    "this property , which we call the _ brownian gibbs property _ and introduce formally in definition [ maindefbgp ] , is easily understood and in many ways unsurprising .",
    "the main contribution of this article is the observation of theorem [ mainthm2 ] , that this brownian gibbs property is preserved in the edge scaling limits of non - intersecting line - ensembles ( such as the random walk and brownian bridge examples which we have seen ) . from this perspective",
    ", the observation seems fairly intuitive ; however , the processes encountered in these scaling limits arise in many other perspectives from which this gibbs property is neither straightforward nor intuitive  in fact , this observation has not previously appeared in the literature .    before discussing the consequences of the brownian gibbs property",
    ", we briefly discuss the two main difficulties in the proof of the result .",
    "each difficulty derives from the edge scaling limit results for such systems having only been proved in terms of finite - dimensional distributions .",
    "the first problem is whether the limiting consistent family of finite - dimensional distributions , which is called the multi - line airy process @xcite , has a version which is supported on continuous , non - intersecting curves .",
    "restricting to just the top line , the existence of a continuous version was shown in @xcite by the exactly solvable systems approach involving asymptotic analysis of fredholm determinant expressions .",
    "the second difficulty is to show convergence in distribution of the finite system of brownian bridges to this limiting ensemble .",
    "once these two difficulties are settled , a coupling argument serves to prove that the brownian gibbs property is maintained in the limit .",
    "in fact , we resolve both difficulties simultaneously by proving a functional limit theorem for the brownian bridge line ensembles ( which is in essence tightness for this family of curves ) , thus showing the existence of the _ airy line ensemble_. in proving such tightness ( as well as the non - intersecting nature of the limit ) , one can not appeal entirely to the finite - dimensional distributions , as they pertain only to a finite number of deterministic times and not random exceptional times at which there may be a small gap between lines or a large modulus of continuity for some line .",
    "the proof must also handle the squeezing of space that occurs under edge scaling .",
    "the determinantal approach seeming to fail here , we appeal to a probabilistic perspective .",
    "we employ the brownian gibbs property of @xmath0 brownian bridges to show that , focusing on the top @xmath28 curves in a rescaled window of size @xmath40 $ ] , the following three events occur with high probability : ( i ) the collection of curves remains uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath28 brownian bridges ; ( ii ) the minimal gap between consecutive curves remains uniformly bounded from below ; ( iii ) the top curve and the @xmath28-th curve remain uniformly bounded from above and below .    that the scaling limit has the brownian gibbs property has a number of significant consequences . in particular , in proposition [ propabscon ]",
    "we show that the top line of the airy line ensemble ( often known as the airy process ) is absolutely continuous with respect to brownian motion ( with diffusion parameter 2 ) on any fixed interval ( this is also true for every other line ) .",
    "this leads to a proof of conjecture 1.5 of @xcite ( stated here as theorem [ propjoh ] ) , a long - standing claim that the airy process minus a parabola achieves its maximum at a unique point . as we explain in section [ absconsec ] , this conjecture leads to theorem [ maxdist ] , which identifies and proves the convergence of the law of the endpoint of a geometrically weighted ground state directed polymer ( i.e. , of the point - to - line maximizing path in last passage percolation ) . appealing to the brownian",
    "absolute continuity result we prove herein , @xcite has employed the airy process continuum statistics of @xcite to give and prove an exact formula for the law of this endpoint .",
    "proposition [ propabscon ] also extends results of @xcite and proves a functional central limit theorem for the airy process on short time scales . in the process of proving our main theorem",
    ", we record several results of independent interest ( see section [ absconsec ] ) , including the proof of conjecture 1.21 of @xcite .",
    "the extensive literature on non - intersecting line ensembles suggests many directions in which to pursue the approach introduced here .",
    "the non - intersecting random walkers model described above goes by the name _ vicious walkers _ and was introduced by de gennes @xcite as a model of directed fibrous structures in @xmath41 dimensions .",
    "this model was then studied in @xcite .",
    "this area has remained of interest due to its connections with symmetric function theory ( specifically schur functions and enumeration of young tableaux as in @xcite ) , discrete analogues of random matrix theory ( for instance @xcite ) , and 2d yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "the non - intersecting brownian line ensembles that we consider are variants of dyson brownian motion @xcite and can be considered as continuum versions of the vicious walkers model .",
    "part of the attention which they attract is due to the description that they offer of random matrix eigenvalue processes @xcite .    within the above literature",
    "are a number of interesting and important scaling limits and perturbations to the basic model considered in this paper .",
    "perturbations to the first few brownian particles result in perturbed airy - like limiting line ensembles @xcite ( see our section [ airylikesec ] ) . scaling limits in the vicinity of the bulk of the brownian bridges",
    "lead to the dyson sine process , and large - scale perturbations ( such as separating half of the starting points and/or ending points ) lead to perturbations in the limiting processes such as the pearcy @xcite or tacnode processes @xcite . likewise , limiting processes",
    "have been derived when the brownian bridges are replaced by alternative path measures such as brownian excursions @xcite , or bessel processes @xcite .",
    "the approach developed in this paper may be extended to study line ensembles with a gibbs property which penalises but does not exclude crossing of curves with consecutive labels . in an upcoming article @xcite , we employ our probabilistic techniques to construct the _ kpz line ensemble _ ( related to the multi - layer extension of the stochastic heat equation constructed in @xcite ) and prove that is has such a `` soft '' brownian gibbs property .",
    "the top labeled curve of this line ensemble is the fixed time hopf - cole solution to the kpz equation with narrow - wedge initial data ( see @xcite ) . as a result of the gibbs property we are able to prove that this solution to the kpz equation is locally absolutely continuous with respect to brownian motion ( analogously to proposition [ propabscon ] ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "non - intersecting brownian paths play the key role ; in @xcite , this role is assumed by diffusions associated to the quantum toda lattice hamiltonian .",
    "oconnell @xcite discovered these diffusions and their relationship to directed polymers ( and hence also to the kpz equation ",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "returning to discrete line ensembles , there are a variety of examples coming from the study of growth processes ( such as the various png line ensembles @xcite ) which have the same large @xmath0 limits as in the brownian case @xcite .",
    "measures on rhombus tilings are closely related to representation theory as well as to vicious walkers . in that setting",
    ", @xcite relates gibbs properties of discrete sine line ensembles to the associated determinant kernel .",
    "the papers @xcite construct infinite - dimensional gibbs line ensembles corresponding to the bulk scaling limits of these tiling related line ensembles .",
    "rhombus tilings also represent perfect matchings for the honeycomb lattice . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that models based on perfect matchings ( on any weighted doubly - periodic bipartite graph @xmath42 in the plane ) are exactly solvable in a rather strong sense .",
    "the authors of @xcite not only derive explicit formulas for the surface tension ; they classify the gibbs measures on tilings and explicitly compute the local probabilities in each of them .",
    "these results are a generalization of @xcite where similar results for @xmath43 with constant edge weights were obtained .",

    "we mention that the effect identified by proposition  [ propconcave ]  that in a system of mutually avoiding processes , low quality boundary data is rare because it entails that the avoidance condition is likely to be quickly violated  is vaguely reminiscent of the separation of arms in planar critical percolation ( see the appendix of @xcite ) and separation of level set contours in two - dimensional random surfaces ( see section 3.5 of @xcite ) .    in the proofs in this section , three devices",
    "to which we will often appeal are ( i ) the strong gibbs property ( lemma [ stronggibbslemma ] ) , to argue that we may consider random intervals whose size is measurable with respect to the external sigma - fields ( called stopping domains ) as if there were deterministic ; ( ii ) monotone couplings of non - intersecting brownian bridge ensembles ( lemmas  [ monotonicity ] and [ lemmonotonetwo ] ) , to understand the behavior of the full @xmath0 line ensembles in terms of that of @xmath28 line ensembles ; and ( iii ) the brownian gibbs property , to translate regularity of boundary data into regularity of the internal collection of lines .",
    "the proof of the following lemma already illustrates in a small way the guiding theme of the paper : the brownian gibbs property is not merely an expression for the conditional distributions of the line ensemble ; rather , the property offers a valuable probabilistic resampling technique by which to prove regularity of line ensembles which enjoy it .",
