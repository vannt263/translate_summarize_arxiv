    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) contain supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with masses in the range of @xmath6 , and their evolution is believed to be closely related to their host galaxies ( e.g. , magorrian et al 1998 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "it is , however , still not understood why such relation exists .",
    "one way to approach this issue is to search for and study smbhs in their growing phase .",
    "smbhs are considered to grow up by accretion and/or merging .",
    "marconi et al . ( 2004 ) suggested that the growth of local smbhs ( redshift @xmath7 ) is mainly governed by accretion , and that accretion is likely to play an important role in the growth process of smbhs .",
    "if accretion is indeed a major process of black hole ( bh ) growth , growing smbhs are expected to have a combination of relatively low masses and high accretion rates .",
    "in fact , recent studies found agns harboring candidate intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) with masses @xmath8 @xmath1 by using optical emission line widths to estimate bh mass ( filippenko & ho 2003 ; barth et al .",
    "2004 ; greene & ho 2004 , 2007a ; dong et al .",
    "greene & ho ( 2007a ) selected 174 agns with candidate imbhs from the forth data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and showed that these agns are radiating at high fractions of their eddington limits with a median eddington ratio of 0.4 .",
    "this class with relatively low - mass bhs with high accretion rates is a candidate of growing bhs and is crucial to study physical processes of accretion and mass growth .",
    "high energy emission , which is from the vicinity of central bhs , is an essential probe of accretion processes and x - ray observations of agns with imbhs are of great interest . among studies with x - rays ( greene & ho 2007b , desroches et al .",
    "2009 , dewangan et al .",
    "2008 , miniutti et al .",
    "2009 ) , relatively good quality x - ray spectra were obtained with _ xmm - newton _ for agns with candidate imbhs selected from the sample of greene & ho ( 2004 ) .",
    "at least four objects show clear signature of the presence of soft excess emission represented by a multicolor disk blackbody model ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) with an inner temperature 0.150.2 kev ( dewangan et al . 2008 ) , which is similar to that observed in more massive smbhs ( gierliski & done 2004 ; crummy et al . 2006 ; bianchi et al . 2009 ) .",
    "photon indices for their sample are in the range of 1.62.4 , which are also in the range seen in smbhs ( lu & yu 1999 ; shemmer et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ; risaliti et al .",
    "these studies are limited to relatively x - ray bright objects selected by the optical band , and a new method using x - rays to select imbh candidates would be useful to compile x - ray bright imbhs for further studies of x - ray properties and accretion physics .",
    "x - ray variability is a well - known property of agns , and its timescale is related to a size of x - ray emitting region .",
    "bh masses can be estimated from x - ray variability by assuming that the size of the emitting region is proportional to bh mass .",
    "for instance , machardy et al . ( 2006 ) estimated bh masses by using power spectral density ( psd ) , which can be used to identify characteristic timescales . on the other hand , the variability amplitude was often quantified by the normalized excess variance ( nxs ) . since nxs represents an integration of the psd in a certain frequency range normalized by the mean count rate squared ( vaughan et al . 2003 ) , nxs can be also used to estimate bh masses .",
    "an anti - correlation between nxs and bh masses was found by various authors ( lu & yu 2001 ; bian & zhao 2003 ; papadakis 2004 ; oneill et al .",
    "2005 ; miniutti et al . 2009 ; nikoajuk et al . 2009 ; zhou et al . 2010 ) . indeed , optically selected agns with imbhs show large amplitude variability on short timescales ( dewangan et al .",
    "these results indicate that highly variable agns are strong candidates for hosts of imbhs and that x - ray variability can be used to find imbhs .",
    "one advantage of a method utilizing x - ray variability to search for imbhs compared with a method based on optical spectra is that imbhs can be found even if they are moderately obscured ( up to @xmath9  @xmath10 ) .",

    "these slopes were chosen because psd slopes of most agns likely lie within this range .",

    "the scaling factor for @xmath144 and 3.00 divided by those for @xmath145 at 14.8 ks are 0.47 and 2.4 , respectively .",
    "if nxs multiplied by 0.47 or 2.4 are substituted for @xmath146 in equation ( 5 ) , bh masses become smaller or larger by @xmath147% , respectively .    the bh masses for our sample were estimated by using equation ( 5 ) , and are in the range of @xmath148 .",
    "the estimated masses for relatively low - mass bhs could be incorrect due to the effect of a break in psd .",
    "nxs represents an integration of the psd in a certain frequency range normalized by the mean count rate squared ( vaughan et al .",

    "we calculated the break times of the estimated bh masses for our sample using the equation in markowitz et al .",
    "the break times of seven sources ( j0113@xmath111442 , j0136 + 1549 , j0324@xmath110256 , j1201@xmath111848 , j1347 + 1734 , j2008@xmath114440 , and j2131@xmath114251 ) are shorter than 50 ks .",
    "the estimated break times for all the other objects are longer than 50 ks and the length of their light curves .",
    "bh masses of these sources are likely to be underestimated , since nxs are overestimated due to the scaling using an inappropriate psd .",
    "we tried to obtain their bh masses taking into account the effect of the break , by assuming a universal shape of psd , a power law of frequency @xmath150 with @xmath151 and 2.25 at lower and higher frequencies than the break frequency , where @xmath152 is a normalization .",
    "first , we calculated the integrals of the psd with and without the break from @xmath153 to @xmath154 , where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are 50 ks and 256 s , respectively .",
    "the integration of the psd with the break divided by that of the psd without the break was calculated .",
    "we multiplied this value by scaled nxs listed in table  5 to obtain new nxs and re - estimated bh mass based on new nxs by using equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the true bh mass should be lower than this re - estimated mass , since the re - estimated mass is calculated by using the break time for the underestimated mass .",
    "we then found a self consistent solution for a mass , nxs , and a break frequency inside the mass range determined by the upper and lower bound of mass derived above .",
    "finally , we obtained the bh masses of the four sources listed in table  5 .",
    "thus , the bh mass range for our sample becomes @xmath157 , and bh masses of the seven sources are @xmath158 or less , which are in the range for imbhs . if the psd slope of 1.50 or 3.00 is used instead of 2.25 , the bh masses estimated by these steps are changed by only @xmath159% .",
    "growing bhs are expected to have a combination of relatively low - masses and high accretion rates .",

    "<S> we present the results of x - ray variability and spectral analysis of a sample of 15 new candidates for active galactic nuclei with relatively low - mass black holes ( bhs ) . </S>",
    "<S> they are selected from the second _ xmm - newton _ serendipitous source catalogue based on strong variability quantified by normalized excess variances . </S>",
    "<S> their bh masses are estimated to be @xmath0 @xmath1 by using a correlation between excess variance and bh mass . </S>",
    "<S> seven sources have estimated bh masses smaller than @xmath2 @xmath1 , which are in the range for intermediate - mass black holes . </S>",
    "<S> eddington ratios of sources with known redshifts range from 0.07 to 0.46 and the mean eddington ratio is 0.24 . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that some of our sources are growing supermassive black holes , which are expected to have relatively low masses with high eddington ratios . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray photon indices of the 15 sources are in the range of @xmath3 , and 5 among them have steep ( @xmath4 ) photon indices , which are the range for narrow - line seyfert 1s . </S>",
    "<S> soft x - ray excess is seen in 12 sources , and is expressed by a blackbody model with @xmath5 ev . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a correlation between x - ray photon indices and eddington ratios , and find that the x - ray photon indices of about a half of our sources are flatter than the positive correlation suggested previously . </S>"
