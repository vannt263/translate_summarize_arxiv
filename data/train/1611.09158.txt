    "teams looking to improve their chances of winning will naturally seek to understand their performance , and also that of their opposition . from a data mining perspective , @xcite and @xcite used cluster and principal component analysis techniques in order to identify the drivers that most affect the probability to win a match .    from a different perspective , nowadays ,",
    "analyzing players trajectories using spatio - temporal data is becoming cool .",
    "there are a number of it systems in use that capture these data from team sports during matches .",
    "spatio - temporal data are characterized by a sequence of samples containing the timestamp and location of some phenomena . in the team sports domain ,",
    "two types of spatio - temporal data are commonly captured : object trajectories capture the movement of players or the ball ; event logs record the location and time of match events , such as passes , shots at goal or fouls .",
    "the movement of players or the ball around the playing area are sampled as a timestamped sequence of location points in the plane .",
    "the trajectories are captured using optical- or device - tracking and processing systems .",
    "optical tracking systems use fixed cameras to capture the player movement , and the images are then processed to compute the trajectories @xcite . in other cases ,",
    "device tracking systems rely on devices that infer their location , and are attached to the players clothing or embedded in the ball .",
    "it is a common procedure to discretize the playing area into regions and assign the location points contained in the trajectory to a discretized region .",
    "a common approach is to subdivide the playing area into rectangles of equal size @xcite .",
    "understanding the interaction between players is one of the more important and complex problem in sports science .",
    "trajectories allow to analyze movements of a single player as well as interactions of all players as a synchronized group , in order to asses the importance of such players to the team .",
    "methods used to analyze these movements using trajectories borrow from many disciplines , such as machine learning , network and complex systems , gis , computational geometry , computer vision and statistics .",
    "for example , the central goal of social network analysis is to capture the interactions between individuals @xcite . as a consequence , in the last decade numerous papers applied social network analysis to team sports , mainly focusing on passing networks and transition networks .",
    "centrality techniques has been used with the aim of identifying key ( or _ central _ ) players , or to estimate the interaction and the cooperation between team members @xcite .",
    "furthermore , control space is considered a key factor in the team s performance .",
    "a player dominates an area if he can reach every point in that area before anyone else .",
    "literature makes use of the tool of the dominant region @xcite , which is equivalent to the _ voronoi _ region @xcite , when acceleration is constant .",
    "another approach regards measuring the average distance of the players in the court , and its evolution over time .",
    "many works are devoted to analyze as the space is occupied by players - when attacking and when defending - or in crucial moments of the match .",
    "we can find examples in football @xcite or in futsal @xcite    another issue regards to model the evolution of football play from the trajectories of the players , which has been researched extensively , particularly in the computer vision community @xcite .",
    "for example @xcite predicted the location of the ball at a point in the near future .",
    "predefined plays are used in many team sports to achieve some specific objective : teammates who are familiar with each other s playing style may develop ad - hoc productive interactions that are used repeatedly .",
    "@xcite addressed the question how to describe analytically the spato - temporal movement of particular sequences of passes ( i.e. the last 25 passes before a score ) .",
    "moreover , segmenting a match into phases is a common task in sports analysis , as it facilitates the retrieval of important phases for further analysis .",
    "@xcite developed a system for visual exploration of phases in football .",
    "as described above , a variety of approaches and methods has already been proposed to solve different issues related to the relation between trajectories and performances in team sports .",
    "this paper provides a simple and ad - hoc strategy to visualize the spatio - temporal movement of a player as well as the synchronized movements of all players of the team .",
    "the aim is to support researchers on preliminar stages of their analysis as well as to facilitate the interpretation of results . to this scope",
    ", i propose to use motion charts .",
    "a motion chart is a dynamic bubble chart which allows efficient and interactive exploration and visualization of multivariate data .",
    "motion charts map variables into time , 2d coordinate axes , size and colors , and facilitate the interactive display of multidimensional and temporal data .",
    "the best known motion chart , popularised by hans rosling in his ted talks , is probably the one provided within ` googlevis ` package in r , ` gvismotionchart ` .",
    "this function allows the user to visualize data stored in r data frames directly in a web browser .    in section [ sec : motionchart ]",
    "i introduce the ` gvismotionchart ` function in ` googlevis ` package , and i discuss this method in relation to team sports",
    ". section [ sec : case ] presents a case study based on trajectories data of basketball players . in this section",
    "i empirically show how the use of ` gvismotionchart ` could gives us clues for further analysis .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] concludes and suggests future developments .",
    "when talking of a motion chart we can think at a dynamic bubble chart .",
    "a bubble chart is a type of chart that displays three dimensions of data .",
    "each entity with is a triplet of associated data , which is plotted expressing two of the three values through the xy - axes and the third through its size .",
    "bubble charts can facilitate the understanding of social , economical , medical , and other scientific relationships .",
    "bubble charts can be considered a variation of the scatter plot , in which the data points are replaced with bubbles .",
    "motion chart allows efficient and interactive exploration and visualization of space - time multivariate data and provides mechanisms for mapping ordinal , nominal and quantitative variables onto time , 2d coordinate axes , size and colors which facilitate the interactive display of multidimensional and temporal data .",
    "motion charts provide a dynamic data visualization that facilitates the representation and understanding of large and multivariate data . using the familiar 2d bubble charts ,",
    "motion charts enable the display of large multivariate data with thousands of data points and allow for interactive visualization of the data using additional dimensions like time , size and color , to show different characteristics of the data .",
    "the central object of a motion chart is a bubble .",
    "bubbles are characterized by size , position and appearance . using variable mapping ,",
    "motion charts allow control over the appearance of the bubble at different time points .",
    "this mechanism enhances the dynamic appearance of the data in the motion chart and facilitates the visual inspection of associations , patterns and trends in space - time data .",
    "the ` gvismotionchart ` is a function of ` googlevis ` package @xcite which reads a _",
    "data.frame _ object and creates text output referring to the google visualisation api .",
    "it can be included into a web page , or as a stand - alone page . the actual chart is rendered by the web browser in flash .",
    "the function generates a motion chart , that is a dynamic chart which is traditionally designed to explore several indicators over time .",
    "motion charts are intensively used and publicized by ans roslin trought ted . `",
    "gvismotionchart ` is used in a wide range of topics , such as students learning processes . @xcite",
    "used different visualization methods available in _ googlevis _ ; @xcite is an example of works where motion charts are adopted as a visual instrument in linguistic and semantic studies of the dynamic of linguistic change over the time .",
    "motion charts are applied different subfields of economics , for example in finance , to visualize sales data in an insurance context @xcite and for the study of inequality and income @xcite . in @xcite motion charts",
    "was applied to aggregated liver transplantation data .",
    "visualization of water quality sampling - events in florida are analyzed by means of motion charts in @xcite .",
    "analytically , the ` gvismotionchart ` function reads as follow :    ` gvismotionchart(data , idvar = i d , timevar = time , xvar =   , yvar =   , colorvar =   , sizevar =   , date.format = y / m / d , options = list ( ) , chartid ) `    where    * ` data ` is a data.frame object .",
    "the data has to have at least four columns with subject name ( ` idvar ` ) , time ( ` timevar ` ) and two columns of numeric values .",
    "further columns , numeric and character / factor are optional .",
    "the combination of ` idvar ` and ` timevar ` has to describe a unique row .",
    "the column names of the ` idvar ` and ` timevar ` have to be specified .",
    "further columns , if not specified by the other arguments ( ` xvar , yvar , colorvar , sizevar ` ) will be assumed to be in the order of the arguments . * ` idvar ` is a column name of data with the subject to be analysed . *",
    "` timevar ` is a column name of data which shows the time dimension .",
    "the information has to be either numeric , of class date or a character which follows the pattern yyyywww ( e.g. 2010w04 for weekly data ) or yyyyqq ( e.g. 2010q1 for quarterly data ) . *",
    "` xvar ` : column name of a numerical vector in data to be plotted on the x - axis . * ` yvar ` : column name of a numerical vector in data to be plotted on the y - axis . *",
    "` colorvar ` : column name of data that identifies bubbles in the same series .",
    "use the same value to identify all bubbles that belong to the same series ; bubbles in the same series will be assigned the same color .",
    "series can be configured using the ` series ` option . * ` sizevar ` : values in this column are mapped to actual pixel values using the sizeaxis . *",
    "` options ` : list of configuration options for google motion chart .",
    "the options are documented in detail by google online ,    now , i contextualize the use of ` gvismotionchart ` for the teams sports movement .",
    "let suppose having data about a number of players : in our _ data.frame _ object we should have a variable that uniquely identifies these players .",
    "this is the ` idvar ` variable .",
    "our _ data.frame _ should also contains a variable uniquely identifying the time dimension in which players movements are tracked ; this is the _ timevar _ variable .",
    "a record in the _",
    "data.frame _ should be uniquely identified by the combination of _ idvar _ and _",
    "timevar_. moreover , our _ data.frame _ should contains two additional variables containing the input for the x - axis and the y - axis . for the x - axis we have the position of the player in ( let say ) the court length and for the y - axis the position in ( let say ) the court width .",
    "these are , respectively , ` xvar ` and ` yvar ` .",
    "the ` plot ` function can be used as to represent the ` googlevis ` motion chart using browser .",
    "` options ` command can be used to define the court s dimension . by default , ` gvismotionchart ` displays a squared chart ( i.e. same length and width ) . with ` options ` we can transform the court to be rectangular and with the right proportions .    summarizing , a _ data.frame _ containing the four variables above described permits to visualize the dynamic of more than one player together : different players can be reported with different ( unique ) colors ( please see the middle chart in figure [ mchart1 ] ) .",
    "other variables should be supplied to the function in order to , for example , set the bubbles dimension ( see the bottom chart in figure [ mchart1 ] ) : when having available the x - axis and y - axis coordinates in successive moments of time , it is easy to compute the speed .",
    "a speed variable should be inputed to characterize the bubbles dimension .",
    "it is possible to visualize the movement of one or more players together by ticking them in the appropriate box in the browser ( top chart of figure [ mchart2 ] ) . in the same vein",
    ", we can activate players trails : it will leave a line in the chart as bubbles play over time ( middle chart of figure [ mchart2 ] ) .",
    "finally , it is possible to set the speed by regulating the _ playback speed _ key ( please refer to bottom chart of figure [ mchart2 ] ) .",
    "basketball is a sport generally played by two teams of five players each on a rectangular court .",
    "the objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter and mounted at a height of 10 feet ( 3.05 m ) to backboards at each end of the court .",
    "this sport was invented in springfield ( canada ) in 1891 by dr .",
