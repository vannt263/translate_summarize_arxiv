    "this paper is the follow - up of the paper @xcite , in which we derived the exact value of intersection exponents between brownian motions in a half - plane . in the present paper",
    ", we will derive the value of intersection exponents between planar brownian motions ( or simple random walks ) in the whole plane .",
    "this problem is very closely related to the more general question of the existence and value of critical exponents for a wide class of two - dimensional systems from statistical physics , including percolation , self - avoiding walks , and other random processes .",
    "theoretical physics predicts that these systems behave in a conformally invariant way in the scaling limit , and uses this fact to predict certain critical exponents associated to these systems .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed account on this link and for more references on this subject .",
    "let us now briefly describe some of the results that we shall derive in the present paper .",
    "suppose that @xmath13 are @xmath14 independent planar brownian motions started from @xmath15 different points in the plane .",
    "then it is easy to see ( using a subadditivity argument ) that there exists a constant @xmath16 such that @xmath17 \\cap b^j [ 0,t ] = \\emptyset   \\bigr ]   = t^{-\\zeta_n + o ( 1 ) } \\ ] ] when @xmath18 .",
    "we shall prove that    [ main1 ] for all @xmath19 , @xmath20    this result had been conjectured by duplantier - kwon @xcite ( see also , more recently , duplantier @xcite ) , using ideas from theoretical physics ( conformal field theory , quantum gravity , and analogies with some other models for which exponents had also been conjectured ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the exponent @xmath21 equals the corresponding exponent for simple random walks ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this result was sharpened in @xcite , where estimates were derived up to multiplicative constants .",
    "it follows from these results and theorem [ main1 ] that if @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote two independent simple random walks started from neighboring vertices in @xmath24 , then for some constant @xmath5 @xmath25 \\cap s ' [ 0 , k ] = \\emptyset \\bigr ]   \\leq c k^{-5/8},\\ ] ] for all @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , @xcite and theorem [ main1 ] imply @xmath27 \\cap b^2[0,t ] = \\emptyset ]         \\leq c t^{-5/8},\\ ] ] for all @xmath28 , assuming that the distance between @xmath29 and @xmath30 is @xmath31 , say .",
    "one can define more general exponents , allowing intersection between some brownian motions , but forbidding intersection between different packs of brownian motions .",
    "for instance , there exists a constant @xmath32 such that if @xmath13 and @xmath33 denote @xmath34 independent planar brownian motions started from points such that @xmath35 for all @xmath36 and @xmath37 , then @xmath38 \\cap { b'}^j [ 0,t ] = \\emptyset \\bigr ] = t^{- \\zeta + o(1 ) } \\ ] ] when @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , one can define exponents @xmath39 corresponding to non - intersection between @xmath40 packs of brownian motions .",
    "it is easy to see ( e.g. , @xcite ) that there is a natural extention of the definition of @xmath41 to pairs @xmath42 , where @xmath15 is a positive integer and @xmath43 is any positive real . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that there is also a natural definition of @xmath44 where the @xmath45 are positive reals with @xmath46 . in the present paper",
    ", we shall derive the value of the exponents for a certain class of @xmath40-tuples @xmath47 ( see theorem [ main3 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we shall prove    [ main2 ] for all real @xmath48 , @xmath49    it has been shown by lawler @xcite that some of these critical exponents are closely related to the hausdorff dimension of exceptional subsets of a planar brownian path .",
    "recall that a of a connected set @xmath50 is the set of points @xmath51 such that @xmath52 is disconnected .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of the set of cut - points of the brownian path @xmath9 $ ] is @xmath53 almost surely @xcite .",
    "consequently , we get the following corollary from theorem [ main1 ]",
    ".    [ c - cut ] let @xmath0 be brownian motion in the plane . then the hausdorff dimension of the set of cut - points of @xmath9 $ ] is @xmath10 almost surely .",
    "recall that the of a bounded set @xmath54 is its outer - boundary , i.e. , the boundary of the unbounded connected component of @xmath55 .",
    "the exponents @xmath56 are closely related to the multifractal spectrum of the brownian frontier @xcite . in particular @xcite , the hausdorff dimension @xmath57 of the frontier of @xmath9 $ ]",
    "is almost surely @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is called the for two brownian paths .",
    "( this is not the definition of the disconnection exponent used in @xcite ; however , the two definitions are equivalent ; see @xcite . )",
    "it had been conjectured by mandelbrot @xcite ( by analogy with the conjectures for planar self - avoiding walks ) that @xmath60 .",
    "upper and lower bounds for @xmath61 from @xcite , combined with the fact that @xmath62 @xcite , showed that @xmath63 .",
    "( see also @xcite for another proof of @xmath64 . ) in the present paper , we derive the values of @xmath65 only for @xmath48 , so that we can not directly apply our results to show that @xmath66 .",
    "however , in the subsequent paper @xcite , we prove that :    [ alllamb ] the function @xmath67 is real analytic on @xmath68 .    combining this with theorem [ main2 ] shows immediately that ( [ m2 ] ) holds for all @xmath69 , and therefore @xmath66 .",
    "this completes the proof of mandelbrot s conjecture :    [ 4/3 ] the hausdorff dimension of the brownian frontier is almost surely @xmath11 .    the formula for the multifractal spectrum of the brownian frontier also follows .",
    "this formula has been conjectured in @xcite as a consequence of the conjectures of duplantier - kwon @xcite and of the functional relations between generalized brownian exponents derived in @xcite ; see also recent physics work on this subject by duplantier @xcite .",
    "the of @xmath0 are the image under @xmath0 of the set of times @xmath70 such that @xmath71 is in the frontier of @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the dimension of the set of pioneer points of @xmath0 is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 .",
    "below , we show that @xmath74 for all sufficiently large @xmath43 ( see ( [ n=1 ] ) ) .",
    "in @xcite it will be proven that @xmath75 is analytic for @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , by analytic continuation of the above formula for @xmath75 , it follows that @xmath77 .",
    "hence , using the above mentioned result of @xcite , we obtain    [ pion ] the hausdorff dimension of the set of pioneer points of brownian motion is @xmath78 almost surely .",
    "let us briefly mention that there is a ( nonrigorous ) link between our results and the conjectures concerning two - dimensional self - avoiding walks .",
    "for instance , there is a heuristic argument ( see @xcite ) which uses the brownian intersection exponents and explains why the number of self - avoiding walks of length @xmath79 on a planar lattice increases asymptotically like @xmath80 , for some ( lattice - dependent ) constant @xmath81 , as conjectured by nienhuis  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a mathematical account ) .",
    "just as in @xcite , a central role in the present paper will be played by / , the stochastic loewner evolution process with parameter 6 , which is conjectured @xcite to correspond to the scaling limit of two - dimensional critical percolation cluster boundaries . in @xcite the processes / were introduced , and it was shown that @xmath82 is the scaling limit of loop - erased random walk , assuming the conjecture that the latter has a conformally invariant scaling limit .    actually , there are two versions of /.",
    "in the first version , which we now call / , one has a set @xmath83 growing from a boundary point of the unit disk to the interior point @xmath84 , while in / , the set @xmath83 grows from a point in @xmath85 to @xmath86 within the upper half plane .",
    "( the precise definitions will be recalled in section [ sledef ] . ) by applying conformal maps , these processes can be defined in any simply connected proper subdomain of the plane .    after recalling the definition of / , we study in section [ s.3 ] some of its properties .",
    "in particular , the / analogues of the exponents @xmath75 , @xmath87 , are computed . from cardy s formula for / ( that we proved in @xcite ) we then derive the asymptotic decay of the probability that / crosses a long rectangle without touching the upper and lower boundaries of this rectangle , and show that chordal and radial / are very closely related .",
    "we then turn our attention to the brownian intersection exponents . in section [ s.5 ] ,",
    "the definition and some properties of the exponents are recalled . in particular , it is explained how to formulate these exponents in terms of non - intersection between two - dimensional brownian excursions .",
    "then , these facts ( properties of / , exponents for / , description of the brownian exponents in terms of brownian excursions , properties of these brownian excursions ) are combined to derive the value of the brownian intersection exponents .",
    "throughout this paper , @xmath88 will denote the unit disk in the complex plane @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 will denote the unit circle . for any @xmath91",
    ", @xmath92 will denote the circle of radius @xmath93 centered at 0 .",
    "@xmath94 will denote the upper half - plane @xmath95 . when @xmath96 are two points on the unit circle @xmath97 , then @xmath98 will denote the counterclockwise arc of @xmath97 from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "just as in @xcite , it will be convenient to use @xmath101-extremal distances of quadrilaterals : this just means @xmath101 times the usual extremal distance .",
    "( extremal distance is also known as extremal length .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for the definition and basic properties of extremal length and conformal maps ) .",
    "the @xmath101-extremal distance between sets @xmath102 and @xmath0 in a set @xmath103 will be denoted by @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath105 and @xmath106 be functions , and let @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "we say that @xmath109 when @xmath110 , if @xmath111 .",
    "we write @xmath112 , if @xmath113 , and we write @xmath114 , if @xmath115 is bounded above and below by positive finite constants when @xmath116 is sufficiently close to @xmath117 .      in @xcite , we studied chordal / as a random increasing family @xmath118 of bounded subsets of the upper half - plane @xmath94 ( or , more generally , their image under a conformal map ) .",
    "as @xmath70 increases , the set @xmath83 grows , and @xmath119 is unbounded .",
    "one can say that @xmath83 is growing towards @xmath86 , which we think of as a boundary point of @xmath94 .    similarly , when looking at the conformal image of @xmath120 under the map @xmath121 that maps @xmath94 onto the unit disk and @xmath86 to @xmath31 , we get an increasing family of subsets of the unit disk that is growing towards @xmath31 .    in the present paper , we will mainly use a variant of this process , called , where @xmath122 is an increasing family of subsets of the unit disk that grows towards @xmath84 .",
    "the main distinction is that @xmath84 is an interior point of @xmath88 , instead of a boundary point .",

    "consider for each @xmath125 , the solution @xmath126 of the ordinary differential equation @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "this equation ( and the corresponding equation for @xmath129 ) was first considered by loewner ( see @xcite , also @xcite ) and is called loewner s differential equation . for each @xmath125",
