    "model membranes consisting of mixtures of saturated lipids , unsaturated lipids , and cholesterol have received considerable attention in recent years because they can be regarded as model systems of biological cell membranes . below a certain temperature ,",
    "the membrane undergoes a lateral phase separation between a liquid - ordered phase ( rich in saturated lipid and cholesterol ) and a liquid - disordered phase ( rich in unsaturated lipid ) .",
    "the resulting lipid domains are sometimes called  rafts \" , and are believed to play an important role in various bio - cellular processes such as signal transduction and cooperative membrane trafficking  @xcite .",
    "a large number of experimental studies have been carried out to further explore the consequences of domain formation in model membranes and their relation with biomembrane functioning .",
    "they include , among others , studies of domain morphology  @xcite , domain budding  @xcite , growth dynamics of domains  @xcite , and formation of periodic lateral structures  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we note that lateral phase segregation was directly observed for lipids at the air - water interface and for giant lipid vesicles using fluorescence microscopy  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in an attempt to understand these experimental findings , several theoretical models have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "more recently , several experimental works have been conducted in order to understand how electrostatic interactions affect the phase separation of model membranes composed of charged and neutral lipids  @xcite .",
    "as charged lipids are everpresent in biomembranes , the role of electrostatic interactions is important also for biological cells .",
    "the phase - coexistence region was reported to be fully suppressed in lipid bilayers consisting of a three - component mixture of neutral saturated lipid dppc ( 1,2-dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine ) , negatively charged unsaturated lipid dops ( 1,2-dioleoyl - sn - glycero-3-phospho - l - serine ) , and cholesterol , because of the electrostatic repulsion between charged lipids  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the extent of the phase - coexistence region appears when salt ( cacl@xmath0 ) is added , an effect that can be understood by the screening of electrostatic interactions in presence of added salt . in a related experimental study , it was shown that for mixtures of dppc , negatively charged dopg ( l-@xmath1 - 1,2-dioleoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphoglycerol ) and cholesterol , the phase - separation temperature becomes higher as salt is added  @xcite .",
    "such effects were also considered in several theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of biomembranes is the compositional asymmetry between their inner and outer leaflets .",
    "collins and keller investigated the phase behavior in asymmetric lipid bilayers , and showed that the domain formation in each leaflet is coupled through an inter - leaflet interaction  @xcite . in some cases , it was reported that phase separation in one of the leaflets induces a phase separation in the second leaflet , while in other cases , the lack of phase separation in one leaflet suppresses domain formation in the second leaflet .",
    "theoretical models based on regular solution theory  @xcite or landau theory  @xcite attempted to take into account inter - leaflet interactions and explored their consequences on the bilayer phase diagram .    in related works based on the poisson - boltzmann theory ,",
    "a model describing the immiscibility transition in _ asymmetric and charged _ membranes was proposed by may and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "their model took into account an inter - leaflet _ electrostatic _ coupling between two rigid and charged planes modeling a bilayer membrane .",
    "the spinodal line , characterizing the phase coexistence , and the critical point were derived and depend on the ionic strength of the solution as well as on the inter - leaflet electrostatic coupling .",
    "one of the main conclusions was that a stronger inter - leaflet coupling enhances the lateral phase separation .",
    "however , it was equally assumed by the authors that the two aqueous solutions in contact with the two leaflets have the same salt concentration .",
    "we note that this assumption is an over - simplification for cellular biomembranes , where due to ionic channels and other active processes , the ionic strength is different on the two sides of the membrane ( the inner- and extra - cellular regions ) .",
    "this difference in ionic strength , in turn , contributes to an additional gap between the surface potential on the two sides of the bilayer and plays an important role , for example , in neuro - transmission processes .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend the model of refs .",
    "@xcite in order to mimic asymmetric biomembranes in a more complete way . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce a model based on poisson - boltzmann theory to describe phase separation for asymmetric charged bilayers  sandwiched \" between two ionic solutions having different ionic strength . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , the variation of the critical point and the entire phase diagram as a function of the ionic strength ( debye length ) and inter - leaflet electrostatic coupling is explored .",
    "it is shown that the phase separation is enhanced as the salt concentration is increased , and is due to the enhanced electrostatic screening .",
    "when an electrostatic coupling between the leaflets is introduced , the lateral phase separation occurs at higher temperatures as compared with the no coupling case .",
    "we also show that the phase - separation temperature increases when the concentration difference between the two salt reservoirs becomes larger . finally , discussion and comparison with other works are presented in sec .  [ discussion ] .",
    "the system is modeled as a binary lipid - bilayer composed of a mixture of negatively charged and neutral lipids .",
    "although many experiments are done in the presence of added cholesterol as a third component , it is reasonable to stay within the simpler case of a binary lipid mixture .",
    "as cholesterol is non - charged , its presence will not change in any major way our predictions on the role of electrostatics .",
    "the bilayer consists of two undeformable and parallel leaflets , lying in the @xmath2-plane and in contact , respectively , with the two monovalent salt solutions , as is shown in fig .",
    "let us label all quantities residing on the inner leaflet by the subscript 1 and those on the outer one by 2 .",
    "the inner leaflet ( leaflet 1 ) is located at @xmath3 and is in contact with the inner reservoir located at @xmath4 , while the outer leaflet ( leaflet 2 ) is located at @xmath5 and is in contact with the outer reservoir at @xmath6 . in some experiments spontaneous budding of charged domains toward the vesicular interior",
    "was reported  @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by considering the increase in the osmotic pressure coupled with the change in spontaneous curvature of the outer leaflet .",
    "however , in the present study we assume that the bilayer remains flat and neglect the effect of the osmotic pressure generated across the bilayer .",
    "our model is further based on three principal assumptions : ( i ) because we do not consider membrane undulations and their curvature , the two leaflets have the same area @xmath7 .",
    "( ii ) the neutral and negatively charged lipids have the same cross - sectional area per lipid @xmath8 .",
    "this is supported by many experiments on fluid - like membranes .",
    "( iii ) furthermore , each leaflet is taken as an incompressible two - dimensional fluid .",
    "hence , the two leaflets consist of the same total number of lipid molecules @xmath9 .",
    "the total free energy per lipid molecule is given by @xmath10 where all energies are measured in units of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath13 the temperature ) , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the mole fractions of the negatively charged lipid in leaflets 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the free energy @xmath16 consists of two non - electrostatic @xmath17 terms ( one for each leaflet ) , and an electrostatic one @xmath18 that induces an inter - leaflet coupling .",
    "the non - electrostatic @xmath17 is the flory - huggins free energy of lateral mixing in each of the leaflets separately @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ( non - electrostatic ) interaction parameter between the two different lipids .",
    "quite generally , @xmath20 is taken to vary inversely with the temperature .",
    "the free energy @xmath17 is a sum of the ideal entropy and enthalpy of mixing between the two lipid species . in the absence of the electrostatic interaction , @xmath21 , the two - phase coexistence region in the ( @xmath20,@xmath22)-plane is delimited by a demixing curve that terminates at the critical point : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the electrostatic free energy @xmath18 can be calculated through the charging process  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the dimensionless surface potentials on leaflets 1 ( @xmath3 ) and 2 ( @xmath5 ) , respectively , and @xmath28 is the elementary charge , while the electric potential inside the lipid hydrocarbon core region ( @xmath29 ) is denoted by @xmath30 . within mean - field theory ,",

    "the boundary conditions of the two leaflets are given by @xmath42 where @xmath8 is the cross - sectional area per lipid head group and @xmath43 is the dielectric constant of the lipid hydrocarbon core - region . far from both sides of the membrane ,",
    "the bulk electric potential is taken to be zero , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    under these boundary conditions ,",
    "the above equations can be solved analytically , yielding transcendental expressions for the two surface potentials , @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the membrane potential gap . throughout the paper",

    "the ratio @xmath52 is related to the ratio between the two debye screening lengths , @xmath53 , of the two solutions , and @xmath54 is the rescaled electrostatic coupling parameter between the two leaflets . by further defining @xmath55 and @xmath56 as effective mole fractions of the negatively charged lipid in each leaflet",

    "let us first discuss the case of equal ionic strength ( @xmath87 ) of the two solutions and review some of the results reported already in ref .",

    "based on the model described in the previous section , we present results for the critical point and phase diagrams in the case of two coupled and charged leaflets .",
    "in particular , we focus on the difference between a symmetric case in which the two solutions have the same ionic strength ( @xmath87 ) and the asymmetric case in which they differ ( @xmath102 ) .    we start by giving some estimates for the physical choices of the parameter values of @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the cross - sectional area of a lipid headgroup is set to about @xmath105@xmath106 ( taken to be the same for the two lipids ) , and the membrane thickness is @xmath107 . from these values together with @xmath108 , @xmath109 ( @xmath110 is the vacuum permittivity ) and @xmath111k , we obtain @xmath112 where @xmath113 is measured in angstroms , and @xmath114 . in the following , we use a range of values @xmath115 and extended the @xmath54 range to cover @xmath116 . in the case of monovalent salt ,",
    "the values @xmath115 correspond , respectively , to @xmath117   or to @xmath118 m , @xmath119 mm , @xmath120 mm .",

    "hence it should be taken just to indicate trends with changing the salinity .",

    "[ fig4](b ) , ( e ) and fig .",

    "all other phase diagrams correspond to asymmetric situations , @xmath102 .",
    "the phase - coexistence region becomes relatively larger when @xmath147 , corresponding to strongly screened systems .",
    "however , @xmath127 for the asymmetric case is smaller than that of the symmetric case . when @xmath148 , most of the tie - lines are nearly parallel to either @xmath14- or @xmath15-axis .",
    "this implies that the phase separation in each leaflet takes place almost independently and without any noticeable correlation with the second leaflet . on the other hand , for @xmath149 ,",

    "the three - phase - coexistence regions are indicated by shaded triangles in the phase diagrams .",
    "the tie - lines in the vicinity of the three - phase - coexistence regions are almost orthogonal to the principal diagonal @xmath88 , indicating that @xmath14 is small when @xmath15 is large and vice versa .",
    "this occurs when the local concentration of charged lipid in one of the leaflets is increased , while the concentration in the second leaflet is decreased conversely .",
    "this behavior is caused by the electrostatic coupling between the leaflets , as is discussed in the next section .",
    "several points merit further discussion .",
    "first , we compare our theoretical results with experiments , where it was reported that the phase separation is enhanced when salt is added to charged bilayers  @xcite .",
    "such a tendency is well reproduced in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] when the salt concentration in solution 2 is increased or equivalently @xmath104 is decreased .",
    "a similar trend was also presented in previous works  @xcite for charged membranes without any electrostatic inter - leaflet coupling .",
    "in addition , it was reported by vequi - suplicy _ et al . _  @xcite that the phase - separation temperature increases in the presence of salt .",
    "in previous experimental studies  @xcite , vesicles were first dispersed in the aqueous solution , and only then salt was added , affecting only the ionic strength of the solution outside the vesicles . for this experimental procedure the value of @xmath137 is smaller than unity ( recalling that @xmath150 corresponds to the outer reservoir ) .",
    "this situation is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where @xmath151 decreases as @xmath141 becomes smaller , in accord with the experimental observations .",
    "in addition , we find that also for @xmath142 , @xmath127 is decreased even if the electrostatic screening is weak . in order to confirm this behavior in experiments , only the outer solution should be diluted in order to yield @xmath142 .",
    "controlled experiments done on asymmetric charged membranes with asymmetric in and out ionic strengths are needed to confirm the predictions of the present work . because the lipid composition in each leaflet prepared by gentle hydration or electroformation is not well controlled ,",
    "it is better to prepare vesicles by transferring water - in - oil droplets coated by lipids from an oil phase to a water phase  @xcite or by using asymmetric montal - mueller planar bilayers  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the physical reason why @xmath127 decreases for @xmath142 .",
    "such a tendency is more pronounced for larger @xmath152 , because the electrostatic coupling between the two leaflets becomes stronger .",
    "notice that the electrostatic coupling depends on @xmath103 and @xmath104 as well as on @xmath54 .",
    "as schematically presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the electrostatic coupling is weaker when the salt concentration in solution 2 is higher ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , and the phase separation is suppressed .    on the other hand , when the salt concentration in solution 2 is low ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , the screening is not as efficient , and phase separation is induced due to the strong electrostatic coupling .",
    "note that in the latter case , the strong demixing in leaflet 1 is induced by changing the salt concentration in other reservoir ( solution 2 ) , which is coupled directly with the opposite leaflet .",
    "this is indeed an interesting situation because the higher salinity in solution 1 relative to 2 triggers the phase separation in leaflet 1 due to the strong inter - leaflet electrostatic coupling .",
    "the region where the tie - lines are almost parallel to the @xmath14 axis means that the phase separation mainly takes place in leaflet 1 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( c ) and ( f ) as well as in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( c ) and ( f ) , such an region becomes much larger than the region where the phase separation strongly occur in leaflet 2 for large @xmath104 . on the other hand",
    ", the phase separation also occurs in leaflet 2 , although the concentration difference between two phases is very small . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , @xmath127 is slightly decreased when @xmath103 is smaller , and can be understood by noting that the screening sufficiently weakens the electrostatic coupling .    in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we have shown that @xmath127 is smaller for larger @xmath54 , i.e. , when the electrostatic interaction across the membrane is large . because of the electrostatic coupling , the local charge accumulation in one of the two leaflets suppresses the charge accumulation in the other leaflet , and it is energetically unfavorable for the charged domains on each leaflet to face each other . as a result , a phase separation is induced in the other leaflet driven by the electrostatic coupling .",
    "next we elaborate on the physical meaning of the slope of the tie - lines in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] . when the tie - lines are located close to the three - phase region ( triangle ) and/or when @xmath54 is large , the tie - lines tend to be almost orthogonal to the principal diagonal .",
    "these tie - lines connect two points on the binodal line that have a large compositional asymmetry between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it indicates that the charged domains in one leaflet do not prefer to face the charged domains in the other leaflet .",
    "the model by baciu and may  @xcite as well as the present model deal with the compositional coupling between the two leaflets arising exclusively from electrostatic interactions .",
    "consequently , it is energetically favorable for the charged domains on each leaflet not to face each other .    in order to see the contribution of the electrostatic coupling clearly",
    ", we consider the electrostatic coupling in the symmetric case ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the free energy of the inter - leaflet interaction @xmath153 is obtained by subtracting the contributions of individual leaflets from the total free energy @xmath154 for small composition differences , the potential difference across the membrane is approximately given by @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the average composition of the charged membrane . by substituting eq .",
    "( [ approx_psi ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ coupling ] ) , the free energy of the inter - leaflet interaction can be expanded  @xcite in terms of @xmath157 , @xmath158 from eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) , it is clear that @xmath153 is negative and becomes smaller when the difference between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is large , because the coefficient of @xmath159 is negative .",
    "this is consistent with the diagonal tie - lines in the phase diagrams , and a similar tendency can be seen even for the more general asymmetric systems .",
    "in general , the physical origin of the coupling between the two leaflets can vary and does not have to rely exclusively on electrostatics interaction .",
    "examples of such non - electrostatic effects were considered in previous works  @xcite and include cholesterol flip - flop , dynamic chain interdigitation , van der waals interaction or composition - curvature coupling .",

    "so we neglected any possible bilayer deformation that can occur because of osmotic pressure difference resulting from a difference in ionic concentrations ( @xmath125 ) on the two membrane sides . in experiments ,",
    "phase - separated domains produce budding toward the interior of the vesicle and this is a direct consequence of the osmotic pressure on the spontaneous curvature  @xcite . in future studies",
    "it may be of advantage to consider the combined effect of the phase separation and membrane deformation .",
    "( ii ) we have used the poisson - boltzmann theory for symmetric monovalent salt in order to describe the electrostatic potential .",

    ", we have considered the phase separation in a charged and asymmetric lipid bilayer , located between two ionic solutions having different ionic strengths .",
    "considering the electrostatic effects on the phase separation , we have introduced the electrostatic coupling between the two leaflets .",
    "we studied the effect of the ionic strength difference between the two solutions , @xmath125 , and the electrostatic coupling , @xmath54 , on the membrane phase behavior .",
    "when the electrostatic coupling @xmath54 is introduced , @xmath163 becomes smaller than for the uncoupled case .",
    "moreover , even if the screening effect is small , @xmath127 decreases by increasing the asymmetry in the salt concentrations .",
