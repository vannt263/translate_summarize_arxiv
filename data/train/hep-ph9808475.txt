    "in this very short note we can only present some results for the @xmath0 and energy dependence of elastic vectormeson production and the proton structure function @xmath1 and have to refer for technical steps , discussions and comparison with related works to our original publication @xcite .",
    "the building block of our calculation is the dipole - dipole scattering amplitude .",
    "it is calculated in the framework of the model of the stochastic vacuum ( msv ) @xcite . within this framework",
    "elastic hadron - hadron scattering @xcite , hadron - dipole scattering @xcite , photo- and electroproduction of vectormesons @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite and the proton structure function @xmath1 @xcite were calculated but the cm - energy was always fixed at @xmath3 .",
    "we now extend this approach to higher energies by coupling a soft - pomeron , which trajectory is given by the donnachie - landshoff parameterization @xcite , to large dipoles ( both dipoles larger than a new introduced cut @xmath4 ) and a hard - pomeron with an intercept of 1.28 and a vanishing slope to small dipoles ( at least one dipole smaller than @xmath4 ) . because the msv can not be used for very small dipoles we cut these contributions if one of the dipoles is smaller than a second new cut @xmath5 . by that way we can already describe the data for not to large @xmath6 . in this regime one",
    "observes the transition from the soft to the hard behavior and it is the regime of our main interest .",
    "if we want to extend our approach to even harder processes we include for very small dipoles ( smaller than @xmath5 ) the leading perturbative contribution with a running coupling which is frozen in the infra - red to be @xmath7 . by smearing this dipole - dipole scattering with",
    "process dependent wavefunctions , which we take from the cited references , we obtain different effective energy dependencies due to the different dipole sizes mainly involved .",
    "the two cuts @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the important new parameters .",
    "we did not perform a fit to the data but started with physical values and adjusted a little bit with the result : @xmath8 .",
    "all our old results , where only large dipoles contributed , are unchanged at @xmath9 and we obtain an energy dependence through the soft - pomeron in agreement with experiment .",
    "an example is elastic hadron - hadron scattering or photoproduction of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for the @xmath12",
    "already small dipoles contribute and the energy dependence is much stronger ( see fig.[photojpsi ] ) .     as compared to data @xcite .",
    "fit 1 represents an exponential fit @xmath13 and fit 2 is a fit with two powers which describes our results also for small @xmath14 .",
    "there are also preliminary h1 data for larger @xmath14 ( see for example reference @xcite).,width=283 ]    for electroproduction the effective pomeron slope increases with @xmath0 as can be seen from fig.[electrorho ] for the @xmath15 .",

    "the experimental data are from @xcite for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "there are new preliminary hera data ( see for example @xcite).,width=283 ]    the rising of @xmath19 with @xmath0 shows that by increasing the virtuality one probes smaller and smaller dipoles which are coupled to the hard - pomeron .",
    "this rise of the effective pomeron power with @xmath0 is in agreement with the experiment . for the @xmath12",
    "this effect is smaller since already for photoproduction the dipoles are quite small .      using the different photon wavefunctions depending on the polarization we obtain the total cross sections @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the proton structure function @xmath1 and @xmath25",
    "can be calculated @xmath26 the energy @xmath14 can be expressed by @xmath27 . in our approach",
    "we are limited to large energies , @xmath28 , and small @xmath29 because we only take the pomeron and not the regge contributions into account . in fig.[f2 ] we compare our result for @xmath1 with the experimental data for few values of @xmath30 .     for fixed values of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath31 .",
