    "many - body quantum systems and models have been extensively studied in the last decades in connection with novel materials , offering a fresh view on the fundamentals and the interpretation of statistical mechanics .",
    "the systematic analysis of the phenomena of thermalization and the limitations of a statistical treatment within isolated many - body quantum systems have been recently motivated by experiments on cold atoms in optical lattices , revealing very slow relaxation to thermal equilibrium @xcite , but as well by prototype integrable many - body quantum systems as the one - dimensional heisenberg model realized in real materials @xcite .",
    "specific for lattice many - body quantum systems discussed in the above connection is ( in contrast to single - body quantum systems ) the exponential growth of the hilbert space and the number of eigenstates with the lattice size @xmath0 . here",
    ", one of the fundamental questions is to what extent even a single eigenstate or a single chosen initial wave - function could be the representative of the canonical ensemble average within the given system , both for static and dynamical quantities . for generic many - body quantum systems",
    "one of the central statements is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) @xcite that for a few - body observable @xmath1 diagonal matrix elements @xmath2 at a given energy show only exponentially ( in @xmath0 ) small deviations from the average , being a smooth function of the energy only . since at the same time the off - diagonal matrix elements are as well exponentially small , the time - average of the observable is determined by diagonal terms only .",
    "therefore for any initial wave - function with a small energy uncertainty the long - time average is also equal to the thermal average , this being the general condition for the quantum thermalization process @xcite .",
    "we note that such a hypothesis is also underlying some numerical methods for the calculation of finite - temperature properties , in particular the microcanonical lanczos method @xcite for @xmath3 static and dynamical properties of lattice many - body quantum systems .",
    "it seems also evident that the eth is intimately related to general properties of eigenenergy spectra , i.e.  level statistics and dynamics in generic many - body quantum systems , which reveal wigner - dyson level statistics with the origin in level repulsion and analogy to random matrix spectra @xcite .",
    "the deviations from the eth and normal thermalization have been detected in several directions .",
    "the hypothesis is not obeyed in integrable many - body quantum systems @xcite , although some observables can still thermalize , i.e. , approach the equilibrium ( canonical ensemble average ) value , in particular if the gibbs statistical ensemble is generalized to include all local conserved quantities in this case @xcite . the thermalization can become very slow and the validity of eth can become restricted if an initial state is far from equilibrium @xcite as relevant for sudden quenches in cold - atom systems .",
    "the latter question is intimately related to the deviation from integrability @xcite and the size of isolated many - body quantum systems @xcite . on the other hand , the eth does not resolve the question of the relation to off - diagonal matrix elements ( even in generic non - integrable systems ) which are , e.g. , relevant for transport properties and dissipation in the d.c .",
    "limit @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the validity of the eth and thermalization within a quantum spin - chain system in one dimension , i.e. , the antiferromagnetic and anisotropic @xmath4 heisenberg model , including integrable and non - integrable cases .",
    "while we confirm in the generic non - integrable case the eth for diagonal matrix elements of several local observables , we find large deviations and fluctuations for the integrable case .",
    "in particular , we show that the spread of diagonal matrix elements can be qualitatively and even quantitatively understood from the model of noninteracting fermions . with the aim to resolve the problem of the breakdown of the eth in finite systems we perform the finite - size scaling in non - integrable systems revealing that the crossover from the integrable regime to the eth - consistent behavior is determined by a single scale @xmath5 , coinciding with a transport scattering length .",
    "another finding is that the off - diagonal matrix elements at low frequency ( small difference of corresponding eigenenergies ) and diagonal matrix elements are not universally related even in non - integrable systems , hence the eth does not directly address the low - frequency dynamics and the d.c .",
    "transport quantities , and the generalization of the eth is necessary .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the model and the considered observables , i.e. , `` kinetic '' energy , spin current , and energy current . in sec .  [ dme ]",
    "we analyze the distribution of diagonal matrix elements for integrable and non - integrable cases .",
    "we particularly present a systematic analysis of the distribution widths as a function of system size and observe in the non - integrable cases a crossover to eth - consistent behavior at a certain length scale , which we connect quantitatively to a transport mean free path .",
    "section  [ odme ] is devoted to the relation between off - diagonal and diagonal matrix elements as well as the impact of this relation on low - frequency dynamics and d.c .",
    "transport quantities . in sec .",
    "[ conc ] we finally summarize our results .",
    "as the prototype model we study in the following the anisotropic @xmath4 heisenberg model on a chain with @xmath0 sites and periodic boundary conditions , @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are spin @xmath9 operators at site @xmath10 and @xmath11 represents the anisotropy .",
    "the nearest - neighbor model is an integrable one and we introduce the next - nearest - neighbor @xmath12-interaction with @xmath13 in order to break its integrability .",
    "it should be reminded that via the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be mapped on the @xmath14-@xmath15-@xmath16 model of interacting spinless fermions with the hopping @xmath17 , the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath18 , and the next - nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath19 .",

    "gaussian functions are indicated ( dashed curves ) . ]",
    "it is a nontrivial question whether the fluctuations of off - diagonal and diagonal matrix elements follow the same scaling with @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate the ratio of off - diagonal and diagonal matrix elements fluctuations @xmath116 results for the spin and energy current are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , shown vs.  @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath117 .",
    "they indicate that @xmath118 is not universal ( depends on @xmath119 and model parameters ) and smoothly varies with @xmath40 , but most important is the independence of @xmath0 . we can conclude that for the cases considered here @xmath120 are not following relations within the random - matrix theory @xcite implying generally @xmath121 for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( and @xmath122 for the gaussian unitary ensemble ) .",
    "on the other hand , the ratio still remains within an order of magnitude in contrast to the integrable case where in the gapless regime the ratio appears to vanish leaving finite only diagonal matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the above observation becomes relevant in the evaluation of d.c .",
    "transport quantities , which are within linear response theory related to the low-@xmath123 absorption @xcite , e.g. ,  the spin conductivity ( diffusivity ) and thermal conductivity , respectively , are in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ stiff ] ) , @xmath124 where the d.c .",
    "limit should be considered as @xmath125 and can be expressed as @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the many - body quantum density of states . from our analysis",
    "it follows that in general @xmath128 can not be represented by diagonal @xmath129 , although the qualitative behavior appears closely related ( and even quantitative for @xmath130 as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) . note that for the case of @xmath31 diagonal matrix elements can be also expressed as the sensitivity of many - body levels to a fictitious flux @xmath131 ( or boundary conditions ) , i.e.  @xmath132 , and",
    "the latter relation has been previously employed to evaluate the d.c .",

    "inset in ( a ) : finite - size dependence of @xmath135 . ]",
    "let us in conclusion summarize our results , which may be generic beyond spin - chain systems . the behavior of the considered non - integrable systems we find consistent with the eth for all considered quantities .",
    "if we consider the time evolution of an observable , it can be in terms of ( finite - system ) eigenstates represented as @xmath136 in a system obeying eth , the off - diagonal contribution vanishes for long times @xmath137 , due to the exponential smallness of off - diagonal matrix elements ( compare insets of fig .  [ fig2 ] and fig .  [ fig4 ] ) as well due to dephasing @xcite .",
    "if the initial state @xmath138 is a microcanonical one with a narrow distribution @xmath112 [ with @xmath139 , and due to eth @xmath140 , the first term leads to the microcanonical average @xmath141 in a large system coinciding with the canonical thermodynamical average at a finite @xmath3 , where @xmath142 .",
    "such a scenario is then consistent with the `` normal '' quantum thermalization .    in an integrable spin chain",
    "the distribution of diagonal matrix elements is large , the long - time average [ still neglecting off - diagonal terms in eq .",
    "( [ at ] ) ] in general depends on @xmath138 and corresponding @xmath143 , even for a small energy uncertainty @xmath112 . in order to satisfy @xmath144",
    "one needs assumptions on the distribution of coefficients @xmath143 .",
    "e.g. , in a large enough system randomly chosen @xmath143 would plausibly be adequate .",
    "in fact , the microcanonical lanczos method for the evaluation of @xmath3 properties @xcite , based on the microcanonical states and the lanczos procedure , contains such a choice achieved by random sampling .",
    "hence , a random microcanonical state in a large many - body quantum system would mostly obey the thermalization process .",
    "still , this is not at all the case for particular states as , e.g. , reached by ( strong ) quenching in an integrable system , but as well not in a generic system @xcite since the initial state after the quench is not necessarily the microcanonical one with small @xmath112 .",
    "analyzing the extent of the validity of the eth and thermalization in a finite - size many - body quantum system , we find effectively that perturbed integrable systems beyond the crossover length @xmath5 behave as generic non - integrable ones . since in a `` normal '' spin system only total spin and energy are conserved , one can design two relevant diffusion scales and plausibly the largest would determine @xmath5 , which then appears to dominate the scaling of all quantities , as shown in fig .",
    "the understanding and the determination of @xmath5 is evidently an important theoretical goal , relevant also for experiments dealing with systems close to integrability @xcite .",
    "the eth addresses thermalization and statistical description of static quantities in many - body quantum systems , with the behavior determined by diagonal matrix elements . on the other hand , d.c .",
    "transport quantities and low-@xmath123 dynamics involve only off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "we note that in a generic system , properties analogous to the eth can be defined for off - diagonal matrix elements close in energy , in particular obeying the gaussian distribution and exponential dependence on size . also , the relation between diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements is independent of size @xmath0 , but still the ratio is not universal . in this sense ,",
    "our results show that for such considerations the generalization of the eth is needed but also is straightforward , and it can include the response to weak external fields and dissipation phenomena in many - body quantum systems .",
