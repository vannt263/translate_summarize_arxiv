    "multiscalar - tensor gravity ( mstg ) generalizes the scalar - tensor gravity ( stg ) of a scalar field @xmath3 nonminimally coupled to curvature @xmath4 , to the case of multiple scalar fields @xcite .",
    "nonminimal couplings are typically generated by quantum corrections and arise in the effective models of higher dimensional theories .",
    "diverse versions of mstg appear in fundamental physics and cosmology in various constructions and under different disguises .",
    "first , there are several phenomenological motivations to consider nonminimally coupled scalars .",
    "the standard model higgs field is an su(2 ) complex doublet , in the case it is endowed with a nonminimal coupling to curvature also the goldstone modes may play a role in higgs inflation @xcite and the subsequent dark energy era @xcite .",
    "otherwise a nonminimal higgs may be paired with another nonminimal scalar ( e.g.  a dilaton ) @xcite , or the inflation and dark energy could be run by two nonminimally coupled scalars @xcite .",
    "more general mstg inflation or dark energy models have @xmath5 fields with noncanonical kinetic terms and arbitrary potential @xcite ( also considered for stellar models @xcite ) , or are embedded into a supergravity setup @xcite .",
    "the most general multiscalar - tensor gravitational action with second order field equations includes derivative couplings and is a generalization of horndeski s class of theories , so far worked out for the two fields case @xcite .",
    "second , different proposed extensions and modifications of general relativity can be also cast into the form of mstg by a change of variables .",
    "it is well - known that , if the gravitational lagrangian is nonlinear in curvature , @xmath6 , or more generally @xmath7 , the theory is dynamically equivalent to stg with the potential depending on the form of the function @xmath8 @xcite",
    ". likewise we get an mstg when the original lagrangian is a more complicated function of multiple arguments of @xmath4 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , gauss - bonnet topological term , or weyl tensor squared @xcite , as each such argument can contribute a scalar nonminimally coupled to @xmath4 .",
    "( a function of arbitrary curvature invariants can be also turned into scalars , but the tensor part will not generally reduce to linear @xmath4 alone @xcite . ) if the metric and connection are treated as independent variables , defining curvature scalars @xmath4 and @xmath11 , the resulting general hybrid metric - palatini @xmath12 gravity is equivalent to mstg with two scalars @xcite .",
    "a related construction called c - theory which continuously interpolates between metric and palatini gravities , also possesses a biscalar - tensor representation @xcite . in case",
    "the lagrangian is a function of higher derivatives of the curvature , @xmath13 , each such argument can be converted to a nonmimimal scalar in mstg .",
    "moreover , a lagrangian of nonlocal gravity , characterized by derivatives in the inverse powers , @xmath14 , can be made local by again introducing auxiliary scalar fields nonminimally coupled to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the parametrized post - newtonian formalism ( ppn ) is designed to describe slow motions in weak gravitational fields @xcite , and can be utilized to confront the theory with high precision measurements in e.g.  the solar system .",
    "the original stg computation by nordtvedt @xcite , which assumed that the potential ( mass ) of the scalar field vanishes , has been generalized to studies of higher order effects @xcite and for models with altered kinetic term or extra scalar - matter couplings @xcite . an important lesson learned in the stg case",
    "is that making the scalar field massive by the inclusion of the potential modifies the ppn parameters @xcite , so that the theory becomes viable in a much larger domain .",
    "this has been especially relevant for understanding the ppn behavior of @xmath6 gravity @xcite , equivalent to a subclass of stg .",
    "of course , a similar effect is also present in the generalized stg or horndeski theory @xcite , but curiously misses in scalar - torsion gravity , where the scalar is nonminimally coupled to torsion in the teleparallel framework @xcite .    in the pioneering mstg paper damour and",
    "esposito - farse derived the ppn parameters in the einstein frame and assuming the potential vanishes @xcite .",
    "the effect of the potential was also not considered in the jordan frame computation for the constant diagonal kinetic term @xcite and more recently for a generic kinetic term @xcite .",
    "these results were generalized to arbitrary frame and scalar field parametrization by using the formalism of invariants @xcite .",
    "the ppn parameters for c - theory have been determined by relying on the correspondence with a subclass of mstg in the massless ( vanishing potential ) limit @xcite , while the ppn parameter @xmath0 for specific nonlocal gravity models has been found using the biscalar representation @xcite as well as independently of mstg @xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to calculate the ppn parameter @xmath0 for a jordan frame mstg with generic kinetic terms and arbitrary potential ( but without derivative couplings ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec_2 ] we recall the jordan frame mstg action in different parametrizations . in the process",
    "we define a covariant metric on the space of scalar fields and the vector of nonminimal coupling , these allow us to clarify the invariant notion of ghosts and the meaning of nonminimal coupling .",
    "next in sec .",
    "[ sec_3 ] we carry out the ppn computation for a point mass source and find that the effective gravitational constant as well as the ppn parameter @xmath0 in general depend on the distance from the source .",

    "likewise we can also reparametrize the scalar fields , changing the form of the functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and possibly recasting the theory into a form more amenable for computations and physical interpretation .",
    "we have adopted a system of units where the speed of light and planck s constant are set to equal one , @xmath30 .",
    "the variation of the action ( [ eq : mstg : action_kuusk ] ) with respect to the metric gives a generalization of the einstein s equation , @xmath31 while the variation with respect of the scalar fields and eliminating the @xmath4 term by using the trace of eq .",

    "@xmath36 and @xmath35 reduces to @xmath37 as the factor in front of the scalar kinetic terms , then its negative eigenvalue implies a `` wrong '' sign kinetic term for one of the scalar degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "analogously , a zero eigenvalue of @xmath35 tells that one of the scalar degrees of freedom is nondynamical ( like @xmath38 for a single field brans - dicke case ) and one should better integrate it away @xcite .",
    "we assume the matrix @xmath35 has an inverse @xmath39 , i.e.  @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ". then we may multiply the scalar field equations ( [ eq : mstg : scalarfeq ] ) with @xmath42 from the left , to establish @xmath43 where the kinetic and potential terms are collected into @xmath44 and the influence of matter energy - momentum is mediated by @xmath45    we may call the object with components @xmath46 a vector of nonminimal coupling since it is constructed from the derivatives of the nonminimal coupling function @xmath27 and it transforms as a vector under the scalar field redefinitions . in mstg the gravitational interaction",
    "is mediated by the metric and the nonminimal scalars : the dynamical equation for the metric ( [ eq : mstg : jffeq1 ] ) is sourced by the energy - momentum tensor of the matter fields , @xmath47 , while the dynamics of the scalars ( [ eq : kastfi ] ) is sourced by the trace of the matter energy - momentum , @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath49 has a zero component then in this particular parametrization of the scalar fields the respective @xmath15 field is not directly coupled to the curvature .",
    "analogously , if @xmath46 has a zero component , the field @xmath50 is not sourced by the matter .",
    "however , through the interactions between the scalars as encoded in the potential and kinetic terms of the action all scalars will still be indirectly coupled to curvature and matter in general .",
    "only if all components of the vector of nonminimal coupling are identically zero , can we deem that the scalars as a collection are minimally coupled .",
    "for theories with positive definite metric @xmath51 on the space of the scalar fields , if the length of the nonminimal coupling vector , @xmath52 vanishes , then the scalars are minimally coupled .",
    "the latter statement is frame and parametrization independent since the combination ( [ k squared ] ) remains invariant under the redefinitions of the scalar fields as well as under the rescalings of the spacetime metric @xcite .",
