    "one of the most striking results in observational cosmology over the past five years has been the report of rapid evolution in the space density of x  ray clusters out to @xmath7 .",
    "the strongest evidence for such evolution has been presented by @xcite & @xcite ( h92 ) using a sample of clusters serendipitously detected in _",
    "ipc pointings ( the _ einstein _ extended medium sensitivity survey : emss ) .",
    "they report that the luminosity function of x  ray selected clusters steepens significantly as a function of redshift with the most distant cluster sample having nearly an order of magnitude less x  ray luminous clusters ( @xmath8 ) than the present epoch .    in recent years",
    ", observations by the rosat x  ray satellite have focused on extending the redshift baseline of these evolutionary studies and overall , the results qualitatively agreed with the original findings of @xcite .",
    "for example ,",
    "all the specific deep pspc pointings towards known optically rich , distant clusters of galaxies ( @xmath9 ) have yet to discover a single x ",
    "ray bright cluster ( @xcite , @xcite & @xcite ) .",
    "these studies however , may be biased since most of their original targets were drawn from optically selected catalogues .    in the long term",
    ", such bias can be removed by compiling serendipitous samples of distant x  ray clusters from the large archive of rosat pspc pointings in the same vein as the emss .",
    "several groups have already begun this task and their combined effort should provide a powerful database for quantifying the degree of observed x  ray cluster evolution ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite & @xcite ) .",
    "this work is still in its infancy , mainly because of the large amount of optical follow ",
    "up needed to verify the presence of a distant x  ray cluster and to exclude possible contaminants like stars and agns .",
    "preliminary results from these rosat surveys either appear to be consistent with the emss sample ( see @xcite ) , or , advocating no evolution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical consequences of x  ray cluster luminosity evolution are significant , suggesting that the large  scale structure in the universe evolved hierarchically over a relatively short look ",
    "back time .",
    "however , the present results are inconsistent with simple scale  invariant hierarchical clustering models , since these actually predict an increase in x  ray bright clusters with increasing redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "several authors have resolved this discrepancy but at the expense of breaking scale  invariance and allowing significant energy input into the gas at high redshift ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the problem could be alleviated by steepening the slope of the initial density power spectrum on cluster scales , yet this would be inconsistent with popular cold dark matter theories of structure formation ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "considering the underlying theoretical importance of cluster evolution , we report here a re  examination of the emss cluster sample since this database is the most robust , well  understood catalogue of x  ray clusters out to @xmath5 presently available .",
    "the emss , as a whole , has received intense optical scrutiny over the past decade and many of its 835 x ",
    "ray sources now have a secure identification ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the next section ,",
    "we describe new data available from the rosat pointing archive on nearly half of the @xmath0 emss clusters used by h92 in their evolutionary study .",
    "these new data therefore , provide an important check since many of these distant emss clusters were only @xmath10 sigma detections in the _ einstein _ data , _",
    "i.e. _ there is a large uncertainty on their x  ray fluxes .",
    "the rosat re  observations of these clusters represent a significant improvement on this for three reasons : first , the clusters received , on average , longer exposure times ; second , rosat has a much lower particle background thus improving its sensitivity to low surface brightness , extended objects ; third , the satellite has greater on  axis angular resolution .    this new rosat dataset has allowed us to test two critical concerns about the emss cluster sample : _ i ) _ the accuracy of the x  ray cluster fluxes and therefore , their luminosities ; _ ii ) _ the classification of the x  ray emission as a hot , intracluster medium .",
    "the latter point is very important with regards to identication since x  ray point sources such as stars and agns dominate the x  ray source counts .",
    "therefore , only a small error in classifying these objects as clusters , and vice versa , will make a large difference to the final x  ray cluster subsample .",
    "therefore , the most secure signature of cluster emission is x  ray extent .",
    "this re  examination of the emss is part of a large project aimed at searching the rosat data archives for serendipitous observations of distant x  ray clusters ; serendipitous high  redshift archival rosat cluster ( sharc ) survey ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath11 and @xmath12 to be consistent with previous work .",
    "we present , in table 1 , all the @xmath0 emss clusters , from table 2 of h92 , for which new data are available including re - observations by the rosat satellite and/or further optical identification work by gioia & luppino ( 1994 ; gl94 ) and others .",
    "column 1 gives the emss name of the clusters followed by , in column 2 , the rosat pointing identification number .",
    "column 3 presents the measured redshift of the clusters which were taken from gl94 or carlberg _",
    "et al._(1996 ) .",
    "columns 4 , 5 & 6 give the results of our x  ray source analysis and indicates whether we find the cluster x  ray emission extended or not ( the numbering given in column 6 is the same as that in figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "column 7 gives the pspc off  axis angle ( in pixels ) of the clusters and indicates cases where the cluster was the original requested target of rosat ; @xmath13 of our rosat emss cluster re  observations were again accidental .",
    "column 8 is the averaged pspc exposure time ( vignetted corrected ) , while column 9 gives the net source counts ( within the bandpass @xmath14kev ) .",
    "many of the re  observed emss clusters are detected to significantly higher signal  to  noises in our data than that used by h92 .",
    "columns 10 & 11 are the measured source and background x  ray count rates and the final four columns are the x  ray fluxes and total luminosities computed from these observed count rates in both the rosat and _ einstein _ bandpasses .",
    "the pspc pointing data used in this paper were obtained from the gsfc rosat data archive and reduced using a suite of programs we have developed as part of the sharc survey .",
    "we refer the reader to our forthcoming paper , @xcite , that describes in detail our data reduction techniques .",
    "however , for completeness , we briefly highlight the main features of our analysis here .",
    "the raw x ",
    "ray data were initially reduced using the methodology outlined by @xcite . for each pointing ,",
    "an individual exposure map was constructed from the satellite s orbital information and divided into the binned x ",
    "ray photon data ( 15 arcsecond pixels ) .",
    "we concentrated on the `` hard '' rosat band , @xmath15kev , since this substantially reduces the background count rate .",
    "the exposure and vignetted corrected images were then analysed using our own source detection algorithm which is based on a mexican  hat wavelet transform .",
    "this particular wavelet is well  suited to analysing pspc data since it is the second derivative of a gaussian and therefore , this underlying function matches closely the ( radially averaged ) shape of the rosat point spread function ( psf ) which can be approximated by a gaussian .",
    "a crucial part of our re  analysis of the emss sample was to determine if the observed x  ray cluster emission was extended or not .",
    "for this reason , we present this particular stage of the analysis in greater detail .",
    "the extent of all sources in a pointing was determined directly from our wavelet data taking advantage of the fact that the width of the mexican hat filter , at it s zero  crossing points , is equal to the width ( between inflection points ) of the original gaussian it was constructed from .",
    "therefore , we grew each source outwards from its initial centroid until we reached zero in wavelet  space .",
    "this source boundary , in wavelet  space , is then a measurement of the size of that source and is simply the product of the size of the mexican  hat ( we define this as @xmath16 which is the dispersion of the underlying gaussian ) and the size of the observed source , which in most cases will be the psf . a final centroid analysis",
    "is then carried out on each candidate source , using only the pixels within this zero  crossing boundary , and their major and minor axes determined .",
    "this procedure was independently carried out for three different mexican  hat sizes ; @xmath17 3 , 6 and 9 pixels .",
    "the power of this approach is that the different size filters are sensitive to different regimes of the off - axis psf .",
    "the smallest filter is best suited to the inner region of the pspc field  of  view , while further off  axis , the larger filter sizes become more powerful as the psf increases . for example , at large off - axis angles , the smallest filter tends to break  up",
    "sources because the surface brightness profiles of sources flattens due to increases in the psf and reduction in the rosat telescope effective collecting area .",
    "the @xmath17 6 and 9 pixel filters help to recover from this .",
    "therefore , by changing the filter size in our analysis , we naturally accommodate for a changing psf thus allowing us to probe further out into the rosat field  of  view .",
    "figures 1 and 2 shows the distribution of the major and minor axes , as a function of off - axis angle , for 1637 high signal  to  noise sources detected in the @xmath18 wavelet maps of 407 deep rosat pspc pointings .",
    "the size of the these sources is the convolution of the wavelet size with the intrinsic source size and therefore , they are larger expected .",
    "these pointings have been reduced as part of the sharc survey which is presently investigating all extended sources seen in these data .",
    "the other @xmath16 maps are very similar and are therefore , not shown .",
    "the only difference , as highlighted above , is the area over which the psf locus is well  defined has been shifted to higher off - axis angles .",
    "clearly visible in figure 1 is the expected increase in the rosat psf with off  axis angle above which we must determine if a source is extended or not .",
    "also shown is a line which represents sources that are @xmath19 extended and was empricially determined , as a function of off  axis angle , from these sources ( see @xcite for further information ) .",
    "the off  axis angle and major and minor axes of all emss clusters detected in the 3 pixel wavelet map are presented in table 1 ( column 6 ) and are plotted in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "an emss cluster is designated as extended if its major and/or minor axis is above this @xmath20 line in any of the 3 wavelet maps , for example , ms0811.6 + 6301 was selected as extended based solely on the @xmath21 wavelet information . a question mark in table 1 signifies clusters that do not satisfy these criteria , but appear to lie away from the point  source locus in two or more of its wavelet representations .",
    "the x  ray count rates of the emss clusters were measured interactively using the iraf / pros software package .",
    "this differs from the approach used in the sharc survey and therefore , we describe it fully here . in the original emss ,",
    "the cluster count rates were computed within a fixed angular aperture ( @xmath22 arcmins ) and were later corrected , via a cluster model , to the total x  ray flux . we , however , had the freedom to select a fixed metric aperture thus scaling it sppropriately with redshift and the psf for each individual cluster ( we convolved the angular size of the metric aperture with the expected size of the psf ) .",
    "for aa assumed king profile with a core radius of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we computed the angular size of an aperture for each cluster that would encompass 85% of the total cluster flux , irrespective of redshift and off  axis angle ( the fluxes and luminosities given in table 1 are corrected for the 15% of light expected outside the aperture ) .",
    "furthermore , the interactive approach allowed us examine the environment of each cluster and exclude any nearby sources ( both in the background and source apertures ) . wherever possible",
    ", the background was estimated from an annulus around the source aperture having a similar number of pixels as the source aperture .",
    "if this was not possible , a nearby area devoid of sources was used , ensuring that it was at the same off - axis distance as the source so the vignetting corrections would be comparable .",
    "these measured count rates were finally converted to fluxes ( @xmath25 ) by integrating a 6kev raymond ",
    "smith ( rs ) spectrum through the rosat response function and accounting for absorption using hi column densities interpolated from stark _",
    "( 1992 ) and the model by morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "this therefore , gave us the x  ray cluster flux in the rosat bandpass outside our own galaxy .",
    "we then converted the rosat fluxes to that expected in the _ einstein _ bandpass again using a 6kev rs spectrum .",
    "we chose this model cluster spectrum to be fully consistent with the h92 analysis .",
    "the cluster luminosities ( including k ",
    "corrections ) for both the rosat and emss bandpasses are given in columns 14 & 15 of table 1 respectively .",
    "ideally , we would like to convert our rosat count rates to _ einstein _ fluxes using the individual spectra of these emss clusters .",
    "however , for a vast majority of the emss such data does not exist . therefore , to quantify this potential systematic effect , we re  computed the expected _ einstein _ fluxes of all our rosat emss detections using the luminosity  temperature relationship of @xcite and iterated it until we gained a stable solution ( within 0.1% between iterations ) .",
    "this usually took @xmath26 passes and always changed the final iterated cluster luminosity by less than 6% .",
    "for example , ms0015.9 + 1609 shifted from @xmath27  which is given in table 1  to @xmath28 for an iterated temperature of 11.35kev .",
    "our count rate to flux conversion was also relatively insensitive to variations in the rs metal abundance and varied by less than 10% over a reasonable range of metallicities .",
    "in figures 3 and 4 , we present all available rosat data on the distant @xmath0 emss clusters discussed in this paper .",
    "the size of the individual plotting windows in figure 3 is equal to the diameter of the aperture used to compute the cluster count rates . also shown",
    "is the measured position angle of the observed x  ray emission and the radial direction towards the center of the pspc . in figure 4 , we present the rosat radial x  ray surface brightness profiles for the clusters as well as the appropriate off - axis rosat psf . for the pspc data , this was computed from the point ",
    "source locii seen in figures 1 and 2 ( not the @xmath20 line ) . for the hri data , we used the model of david _ et al._(1993 ) for the psf .",
    "these plots clearly show that many of the re  observed emss clusters are high signal  to  noise x  ray detections and are extended .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "one of the motivations of our work was to check the robustness of the emss flux measurements . in h92 ,",
    "the total flux was computed , using a king model , from the detected flux within a fixed angular aperture .",
    "in contrast , we attempt to measure the total flux directly using a fixed metric aperture .",
    "for the 21 rosat ",
    "emss clusters , figure 5 presents the difference between our rosat mesurement of the total flux of the emss clusters in the _ einstein _ bandpass ( column 13 in table 1 ) and that given by h92 , versus our total rosat  emss flux .",
    "the error bars plotted in figure 5 were derived from the propagation of the errors published on the net counts by h92 and in table 1 of this paper ( column 9 ) . using a @xmath29 test ,",
    "we have compared the data in figure 5 with the expected relationship _",
    "i.e. _ the zero line in figure 5 .",
    "for all the data points , we find @xmath30 for 20 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f ) which is highly improbable .",
    "however , much of this disagreement is due to the two points at the highest total flux ( ms0451.5 + 0250 and ms0735.6 + 7421 ) . therefore , if we constrain our analysis to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we find @xmath33 ( 18 d.o.f ) and @xmath34 ( 12 d.o.f ) respectively . these indicate that the observed scatter ( 28% ) at lower flux levels is consistent with the observed errors on the two datasets ( ours and h92 ) .",
    "a more interesting plot to make is to plot the flux differences in figure 5 as a function of redshift .",
    "this is shown in figure 6 . in this case , there does appear to be a noticeable decrease in the flux differences with increased redshift .",
    "this is quantified by splitting the sample at @xmath35 , with the lower redshift clusters having a mean absolute difference of 39% , while for the higher redshift data , the mean absolute difference is only 19% .",
    "the standard error on both these means is @xmath36 , since both were determined using @xmath37 clusters .",
    "therefore , this observed drop in the mean absolute flux difference is marginally significant .",
    "such a decrease with redshift is consistent with the h92 methodology since at higher redshifts there would be a greater amount of the clusters total flux within the fixed angular aperture compared to lower redshifts , thus the required correction would be smaller .",
    "it is imperative that the classification of all emss clusters should be made as secure as possible .",
    "this is straightforward using the measured extent of the observed x ",
    "ray emission from the cluster .",
    "figures 1 and 2 present the observed extent of our rosat  emss clusters against that expected for x  ray point  sources ( as a function of off - axis angle ) .",
    "overall , 14 of the 21 clusters with new rosat data are flagged extended in table 1 ( column 4 ) . for 3 of these extended sources , h92 also detected an extent in the _ einstein _ data ( these clusters are highlighted in table 1 ) . by combining our extent results with h92 ,",
    "a total of 25 @xmath0 emss clusters now have sufficient x  ray information to measure a significant x  ray extent ( @xmath38 of the whole emss sample ) .",
    "constraining ourselves to @xmath39 , this figure drops to @xmath40 . for these extended clusters , therefore , we are most probably seeing x  ray emission from a hot , intracluster gas which undoubably strengthens their classification as x  ray clusters .",
    "next we discuss the clusters marked as non  extended , or uncertain , in our database .",
    "some of these are the result of low signal  to  noise , low intrinsic x ",
    "ray luminosity and/or uncertainties in the psf at large off  axis angles .",
    "for example , ms0418.33844 is very close to the rosat rib structure resulting in an unrealistic major and minor axis in all 3 wavelet maps and therefore , we only present a lower limit to the cluster size in table 1 .",
    "the same problem occurred for ms811.6 + 6301 in the @xmath18 wavelet map , but it was observed to be extended in the larger wavelet maps .    for emss clusters ms1209.0 + 3917 , ms1219.9 + 7542 , ms1512.4 + 3647 and ms2137.3 - 2353 , there exists significant archival rosat hri data which can help classify these systems . in the pspc data , they all lie on  or near  the observed point source locus in all three wavelet maps ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "they also appear unextended in figure 4 considering the length of exposure time gained in these pspc data , we suggest that these clusters either have compact cores , or , that they are mis - identifications . for ms1209.0 + 3917 and ms1219.9 + 7542",
    ", the hri indicates that these x  ray sources are point  like with little evidence for any x  ray extent .",
    "the optical ccd image of ms1209.0 + 3917 by gl94 , and their own suspicions , supports the idea that this cluster is a mis - identification . for ms1219.9 + 7542 ,",
    "this system is a poor group with a dominant galaxy showing moderate [ oii ] emission in its optical spectrum ( gl94 and stocke _",
    "et al._1991 ) .",
    "the x  ray and optical data combined , appears to indicate that the x - ray emission for these two emss clusters may be due to an agn and not a hot , intracluster medium .",
    "we therefore , remove these clusters in any further analysis of the emss sample .    for ms2137.3 - 2353 and ms1512.5 + 3647",
    ", the hri data indicates that the x  ray emission from these systems is extended compared to the psf .",
    "we fitted a king model to the hri data and measured core radii of @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) arcseconds for ms2137.3 - 2353 and ms1512.5 + 3647 respectively .",
    "clearly , both clusters could not have been expected to be resolved by the pspc instrument since even on - axis , the pspc psf has a @xmath45 arcseconds fwhm ( illustrated in figure 4 ) . for both systems , the angular extent of the x  ray emission represents a metric core radius of less than @xmath46 kpc ; significantly smaller than the rest of the emss sample . for ms2137.3 - 2353 , the lensing work of mellier _",
    "et al._(1993 ) agrees with this metric core radius , while the optical appearance of this system is dominated by a single , large cd  like galaxy with a similar metric size as the observed x  ray emission ( gl94 ) . for ms1512.5 + 3647 , stocke",
    "et al._(1991 ) has classified this system as a `` cooling  flow galaxy '' which is defined to be a galaxy with similar optical characteristics as the dominant galaxy in a cooling flow clusters but which is no associated with a rich , optical cluster of galaxies ( see the ccd image in gl94 ) .",
    "et al._1996 has extensive redshift information on this emss cluster and measure a velocity dispersion of @xmath47 .",
    "however , this system appears to have substantial redshift contamination ( as seen in figure 1 of their paper ) and may indicate that ms1512.5 + 3647 is a projection effect .",
    "more data are required on these two systems to unambiguously classify them .",
    "we do not remove ms2137.3 - 2353 and ms1512.5 + 3647 in our later analysis , but note that our results were quite insensitive to their inclusion , or , removal .",
    "no high quality rosat hri data exists for the remaining 2 clusters marked as non  extended , or uncertain , in table 1 ( ms1208.7 + 3928 & ms1617.1 + 3237 ) .",
    "for these two , we therefore performed monte carlo simulations to assess whether we had the required signal  to  noise to observe an extent or not ( these simulations are presently being developed as part of the sharc survey to help characterise the selection function of that survey and will be presented in detail in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "briefly , the simulations used here involved adding false clusters to the relevent rosat pspc pointings ( table 1 ) using an underlying king profile of core radius @xmath48 mpc and @xmath24 .",
    "these false clusters were given the same signal  to  noise as the real real detections and were positioned at the same off  axis angle ( usually opposite the real cluster in the pspc field  of  view ) .",
    "for each cluster , 10 iterations were constructed and passed through our source detection software .",
    "this allowed us to determine the frequency with which these false sources were flagged as extented . using these simulations as a guideline",
    ", it would appear that ms1208.7 + 3928 is more compact than expected since it was always detected as extended in the simulations .",
    "ms1617.1 + 3237 , however , remains uncertain since the simulations indicated that we do not have high enough signal  to  noise to unambigously detect an extent given this nominal profile ( it was flagged as extended only @xmath49 of the time ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the most striking result to come out of the emss cluster sample is evidence for rapid negative evolution in the x  ray cluster luminosity function ( xclf ; h92 ) . considering the amount of new information gained on the emss sample of clusters over the past few years",
    ", we have revisited the h92 result here .",
    "our motivation for this are two  fold : first , to determine if actual changes in specific clusters make a significant systematic difference to the observed xclf ; secondly , to assess the robustness of the result to small , yet significant , changes in the overall cluster population .",
    "for instance , if the xclf was radically altered , in any sense , by changes to a few clusters , it would indicate that the sample was not stable and remove much of its predictive power . in conjunction , we have re - assessed the statistical significance of x  ray evolution originally reported by h92 .",
    "we initially re  computed the xclf using the same @xmath50 test as employed by h92 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this involved computing the maximum observable volume ( @xmath51 ) for each cluster ,    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the area of the emss survey to a given sensitivity limit ( see table 3 in h92 ) , @xmath54 is the total number of different sensitivity limits ( 19 in total from table 3 in h92 ) and @xmath55 is the lower redshift limit for a given redshift shell . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the smaller of either the maximum detectable redshift for a given cluster , or , the high redshift limit in a given redshift shell was used .",
    "the maximum detectable redshift was computed in the same fashion as in h92 ( eqn . 2 in their paper ) using the sensitivity limits in table 3 of h92 and either our new rosat determination of the cluster luminosity ( using the same csomology and k  corrections ) or that given in table 2 of h92 ( for clusters with no new rosat information ) .",
    "these individual cluster volumes were then converted into a xclf by binning them as a function of luminosity according to    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the number of clusters in the luminosity bin @xmath59 wide .",
    "again , we use new rosat measurements of the clusters x  ray luminosities where appropriate . before we discuss our new determinations of the emss xclfs",
    ", we note that we reproduced the binned h92 xclfs as shown in figure 2 of their paper using only the data given in table 2 of h92 .",
    "the re  determinations of the h92 xclfs are shown in figure 7 for comparison and serve as a good check of our methodology .",
    "meanwhile , figure 8 shows our new determinations of the emss xclfs in the same three redshift shells as used by h92 ; z=0.14 to 0.2 , 0.2 to 0.3 and 0.3 to 0.6 .",
    "we have used , where appropriate , the new data presented in table 1 of this paper , which includes removing clusters that we have flagged as either unextended or uncertain ( see the discussion above and table 1 where we have marked removed clusters with a @xmath60 ) . for clusters with no new information associated with them , we simply used the original fluxes and luminosities quoted in h92 .",
    "poisson error bars are shown and were obtained from the confidence limits tabulated by @xcite .",
    "c|ccc redshift shell & number & @xmath61 & @xmath62 + 0.14 - 0.2 & 19 & @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) & @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) + 0.2 - 0.3 & 21 & @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) & @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) + 0.3 - 0.6 & 21 & @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) & @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) + 0.14 - 0.3 & 40 & @xmath75 & @xmath76 +   + 0.14 - 0.2 & 19 & @xmath77 & @xmath78 + 0.2 - 0.3 & 21 & @xmath79 & @xmath80 + 0.3 - 0.6 & 21 & @xmath81 & @xmath82 +    clearly , the three new xclfs presented in figure 8 are similar to those shown in h92 and figure 7 .",
    "this indicates that the emss sample is internally robust , since 50% of the clusters used in our new emss xclfs have either a changed classification ( cluster or not ) , a new flux measurement ( different by up to 60% ) , and/or a new redshift .",
    "certain clusters have changed substantially in luminosity , populating different bins in our xclf than they did in the h92 result .",
    "this is certainly true in the highest redshift shell where the 2 clusters ms0015.9 + 1609 and ms0451.6 - 0305 have been elevated in total luminosity to occupy a previously unoccupied bin centered at @xmath83 .",
    "we note here that other re  determinations of the rosat flux for these two clusters are in good agreement with ours ( hughes , private communication , neumann & bhinger 1996 , donahue & stocke 1995 ) .",
    "however , these binned xclfs do not allow us to judge the statistical significance of our work and therefore , we parameterised our luminosity functions using a power - law luminosity function of the form , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the clusters luminosity in units of @xmath86 ( h92 ) . for every cluster in a particular redshift shell ,",
    "we compute the probability that we would see this cluster , at that luminosity , given the sensitivity limits of the emss ( in h92 table 3 ) and the model .",
    "this probability ( @xmath87 ) can be expressed in full as ,    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the observed luminosity of a cluster ( taken from table 1 of this paper or table 2 from h92 ) , @xmath90 is the available volume within which that cluster could have been seen and @xmath91 is a delta function which is unity at @xmath92 and zero for all other values of @xmath93 .",
    "this , therefore , assumes no error on the observed luminosities ( see below ) and eqn .",
    "3 can be reduced to    @xmath94    where @xmath51 is given in eqn .",
    "1 ( the available search volume of the cluster ) and @xmath59 is chosen to be vanishingly small so only a @xmath92 cluster can fall within this interval ( see cash 1979 for full details ) . in eqn . 3 and 4 , @xmath54 is the normalisation such that    @xmath95    intergrated over the entire same range of luminosities .",
    "the likelihood of a given model is therefore ,    @xmath96    using equations 3,4 and 5 .",
    "since our ml method is slightly different from the approach implemented by h92 , we ensured that our ml fits to the original h92 data were compatible with those published in their paper .",
    "in other words , we attempted to fully reproduce the h92 result using only the data in table 2 of their paper .",
    "we summarise these results in table 2 and the fits are shown in figure 7 .",
    "overall , we obtained excellent agreement with the h92 results with only one significant discrepancy ; we see a @xmath97 large error on the low redshift xclf than h92 ( in tables 2 and 3 , we present in parentheses the slopes , and errors , on all 3 emss xclfs as published in h92 ) .",
    "the source of this discrepancy remains unclear but may be the result of us have a different likelihood distribution , for this low redshift shell , than h92 and gioia _",
    "et al._(1990a ) .",
    "this would effect our error analysis because we integrated the observed likelihood distribution directly , while h92 and gioia _",
    "et al._(1990a ) used an analytical approach which assumes the likelihood distribution is a gaussian ( gioia , private communication ) .",
    "we performed this latter approach on our data and did find a smaller error on the slope of the low redshift emss xclf compared to that presented in table 2 .",
    "however , it was not large enough to fully explain this discrepancy between us and h92 .",
    "table 3 summaries the ml parameterisations of our new emss xclfs and includes ( in parentheses ) the original h92 results for comparison .",
    "the normalisation of the power  law xclf ( k ) was computed by requiring eqn .",
    "5 to give the observed number of clusters .",
    "our ml parametric representations are in reasonable agreement with those published by h92 .",
    "this should not be too surprising given the visual similarity in the binned xclfs .",
    "the largest discrepancy is in the slope of the highest redshift xclf , where we find a shallower slope than h92 by @xmath98 .",
    "this change is almost exclusively due to the increased dynamic range in luminosity we are probing since we have a new highest luminosity bin compared to h92 .",
    "we also find that our determination of the low redshift xclf has a steeper slope compared to the original h92 result ( we were able to re  produce the h92 slope when we used only their data ) .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since we have only changed 4 clusters in this redshift shell ( 2 changed in luminosity and 2 clusters were removed ; see table 1 ) .",
    "we have investigated this discrepancy by re  computing the low redshift xclf removing each of these 4 clusters one at a time .",
    "the most significant effect is noticed when ms2318.7 - 2328 is removed because of a lower redshift measurement by romer ( 1994 ) .",
    "this cluster is the highest luminosity cluster in the original h92 determination of the low redshift xclf and therefore , it is understandable that its removal has the largest effect on our xclf re  determination ( also it explains why we see a steeper slope since we have removed the highest luminosity cluster in that shell ) .",
    "overall , this low redshift shell is poorly determined since it is very sensitive to small changes in the dataset .    to quantify the statistical significance of our ml fits , we present in tables 2 and 3 the computed errors on our ml parameters .",
    "these were computed by re  normalising the observed likelihood distributions ( by integrating over the whole distribution and dividing it by the total ) for the three redshift shells and determining the interval that enclosed 68% of the values .",
    "figure 9 presents our observed likelihood distributions for the three redshift shells and can be approximated by a gaussian .",
    "this figure is extremely enlightening , since it shows that the slope ( @xmath61 ) of the low redshift parametric xclf is insufficiently constrained since it has a wide likelihood distribution .",
    "overall , the high redshift xclf parameterisation is only mildly inconsistent with the low redshift data .",
    "the probability of not getting the high redshift slope  from the low redshift data  is only 93% .",
    "this is caused by a combination of the low dynamic range  in luminosity  that the low redshift data extends over and the changes in the xclf slopes mentioned above .",
    "moreover , the difference in slope between the low and middle redshift xclfs is clearly insignificant with the probability of obtaining the middle redshift shell maximum likelihood slope  from the low redshift data",
    " being 51% .",
    "since the error on the xclfs is crucial to any measurement of xclf evolution , we tested our ml error analysis by performed monte carlo simulations ( @xmath99 iterations per xclf ) .",
    "this involved generating fake cluster databases  with the same total number of clusters as the real data  drawn at random from the parameterised h92 xclfs .",
    "for all three redshift shells , the mean of the subsequent distribution of fitted xclf slopes measured for these fake cluster catalogues was identical to the original input values .",
    "moreover , the distributions were gaussian  like and had dispersions very similar to those presented in tables 2 and 3",
    ". therefore , our error estimates on the real xclfs given in tables 2 and 3 are consistent with the scatter expected for these number of clusters ( in each redshift shell ) .      in this section",
    "we move beyond the analysis used by h92 to incorporate different statistical tests and independent xclf results published over the last few years .",
    "we also investigated splitting the sample into different redshift shells .",
    "our analysis has highlighted that the low redshift emss xclf is insufficiently constrained .",
    "recently , however , ebeling _",
    "et al._(1995 , 1996 ) has published a new low redshift xclf using the rosat all  sky survey ( rass ) brightest cluster sample comprising of 173 @xmath100 x  ray clusters . from their analysis",
    ", they found that the data was consistent with no xclf evolution out to @xmath35 .",
    "this can be seen in figure 10 , where we compare this new rass xclf with our re  determiations of the emss xclfs .",
    "we have now combined the lower two redshift emss shells ( _ i.e. _ @xmath101 to 0.3 ) since our analysis indicates that there is little statistical difference between the two .",
    "furthermore , it helps in our search for evidence for xclf evolution because it increases the dynamic range  in cluster luminosities  studied thus providing a greater constraint on the fitted ml parameters ( see figure 9 and table 3 ) .",
    "clearly , there is excellent agreement between the rass xclf and our combined lower redshift emss xclf .",
    "this is very impressive since the two samples cover different redshift regimes _ i.e. _ the rass sample only has @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) of its clusters at @xmath0 ( @xmath104 )  the lower limit of the emss data  and all having @xmath105 ) .",
    "the fact that these two xclfs , from different surveys over different redshift ranges , agree so well justifies our original motivation for combining the two lower emss samples .",
    "clearly , the emphasis should now be on determining the degree of evolution above @xmath35 .",
    "we say this irrespective of our own work , since ebeling _",
    "et al._(1995 , 1996 ) sees no evidence for evolution at redshifts lower than this using a much larger sample of clusters .",
    "we have therefore , compared this new combined lower redshift emss xclf with that derived at high redshift .",
    "although the fitted ml slopes of these two emss xclfs are different ( @xmath101 to 0.3 compared to @xmath35 to 0.6 ) , a close inspection of figure 9 and table 3 highlights that this discrepancy is only mildly significant .    to quantify this significance ,",
    "we have implemented a 2d kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( ks ) test , in the @xmath106@xmath107 plane , comparing the two redshift shells , 0.14 to 0.3 and 0.3 to 0.6 , from our improved emss sample .",
    "the @xmath107 was calculated using the approach outlines in avni & bahcall ( 1980 ) using a uniform density distribution .",
    "this statistical analysis removes the need for any binning , or fitting , of the data and directly test the hypothesis that these two distributions were drawn from the same underlying parent distribution .",
    "therefore , for this application , it is a very powerful method .",
    "figure 11 shows the data displayed in the @xmath106@xmath107 plane for the two redshift shells mentioned above .",
    "a ks test of these two gives a probability of 15% that they were drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "this drops only slightly to 11% if we limit ourselves to comparing the @xmath101 to 0.2 shell to the high redshift shell . in these ks tests ,",
    "we have constrained the data to @xmath108 since below this limit the high redshift shell starts to become seriously incomplete ( the emss does not have the sensitivity to probe such clusters at these high redshifts ) .",
    "if we compare all the data without a luminosity cut , the above ks probabilities  that the two distributions are the same  are 9% and 5% respectively .    for comparison , we also computed the mean @xmath107 in the high redshift shell ( over the same range of @xmath109 ) for both our improved emss sample and the original h92 sample .",
    "we found @xmath110 for our data and @xmath111 for h92 ( the standard error on the mean is quoted ) .",
    "this again indicates that the evidence for evolution in the high redshift shell has decreased since our measured mean @xmath107 is now consistent with the expected value ( 0.5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "most statistical analyses of xclfs do not include observed luminosity errors .",
    "as can be seen in figures 5 and 6 , this can be a large effect and a function of redshift .",
    "for completeness therefore , we re  computed our ml parameterisations of the xclfs but replacing the delta function in eqn . 3 by a gaussian whose width is equal to the observed luminosity error ( using either the error on the flux given in table 2 of h92 or our error on the rosat flux in table 1 of this paper ) .",
    "this is computationally intensive since for each cluster the probability of it being observed is now an integral over a range of possible luminosities ( because of the error in the luminosity ) .",
    "the search volume for each possible luminosity is re  computed ( eqn .",
    "1 ) since @xmath112 changes with luminosity .    in table 3",
    ", we present these new ml parameterisation of the low , middle and high redshift emss xclfs . as can be seen ,",
    "their are two effects in adding such errors .",
    "first , all the slopes have steepened with respect to their previous determinations ( with no errors ) .",
    "second , the degree to which they have steepened is different for each redshift shell , with the lower redshift shells changing the most .",
    "therefore , the statistical significance of any steepening with redshift of these slopes is now lessened ; the low and high redshift shells are only inconsistent at the @xmath4 level .    finally , we turn our attention to the form of the very high redshift xclf _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath113 to @xmath114 .",
    "in the past few years , several groups have used the rosat satellite to extend the study of xclf evolution into this redshift regime ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , further optical follow  up by gl94 has revealed two new emss clusters that have @xmath9 ( see also luppino & gioia 1995 ) .",
    "although the data are still very limited , we have plotted the volume density of these two very high redshift emss clusters as a single point in figure 10 .",
    "also plotted is the lower limit for lower luminosity clusters in this redshift shell as derived by @xcite . in both case , these data are consistent with the lower redshift emss xclfs .    using the emss sensitivity limits given by h92 , we have computed that the lowest detectable cluster luminosity in this very high redshift shell is @xmath115 .",
    "given the low redshift xclf parameterisation ( redshift 0.14 to 0.3 ; table 3 ) , we estimate that the emss should have detected a total of 10 clusters brighter than this limit at these very high redshifts ( we would expect three of these clusters to have @xmath116 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is either evidence for evolution in the bright end of the xclf at these high redshifts , or , a reflection of the emss classification procedure ( the highest redshift clusters are the hardest to find and measure ) .",
    "we present in this paper a thorough re - examination of the emss cluster sample using new data from the rosat pspc pointing archive .",
    "furthermore , we include the latest information on the optical follow  up of this sample of clusters . in total ,",
    "32 of the original 67 @xmath0 emss clusters used by h92 to study x  ray cluster evolution have new information associated with them , of which , 21 have new x ",
    "ray data obtained from the rosat archive . for these clusters , we find no systematic difference , as a function of x  ray flux , between the original emss flux estimates and our rosat re  determinations ( @xmath117 scatter ) .",
    "our analysis did however , indicate that this scatter may be correlated with cluster redshift with the high redshift clusters having a lower scatter by a factor of two .",
    "this is consistent with the expected trend given that the original emss fluxes were computed within a fixed angular aperture .",
    "we determined the extent for 21 of the rosat re - observed clusters , of which , 14 were clearly extended compared to the rosat point  spread function . combining this with results from h92 ,",
    "40% of the @xmath0 emss clusters are extended in the x ",
    "rays thus securing their classifications as x  ray clusters . for the other 7 clusters ,",
    "only 2 were definitely classed as point  like x  ray sources and the optical follow  up",
    "work of these clusters supports the idea that these maybe mis  classifications .",
    "the remaining 5 clusters are uncertain , either due to a lack of signal  to  noise to make a conclusive statement on their extent , or , they simply resist easy categorisation ( ms2137.32353 , ms1512.4 + 3647 ) .",
    "this exercise also highlights the power of the sharc analysis methods .",
    "we were able to extract known distant x  ray clusters from the rosat pspc data archive based upon their observed x  ray extent ( clusters make up a small fraction of all x  ray emitting sources ) . in cases where we did not detect an extent , there is a clear and well  understood reason for missing the cluster .",
    "for example , certain systems ( @xmath118 of the emss ) have intrinsically compact cores compared to typical x  ray clusters and the rest of the emss sample and may represent as a new class of x  ray source ( see stocke _ et al._1991 ) . full details of the sharc survey selection function will be presented in future papers .",
    "we have used this improved emss catalogue to revisit the question of x  ray cluster luminosity evolution . the original work of h92 suggested a steepening of the slope of the xclf with redshift with a statistical significance of @xmath20 .",
    "we employed similar statistical analysis as h92 ( binned @xmath119 test and maximum likelihood analysis ) to our data and found that , in general , we find similar xclfs as presented by h92 .",
    "however , we found two significant differences .",
    "first , figure 9 shows that the emss provides a poor determination of the local x  ray cluster luminosity function and shows that the low redshift emss xclf is consistent with all the other emss xclfs .",
    "secondly , we find a shallower slope for the high redshift emss xclf , which immediately reduces the significance of any claimed x ",
    "ray cluster luminosity evolution .",
    "we have compared our determinations of the emss xclfs with those found in the literature . for this comparison ,",
    "we have combined the two lower redshift emss xclf since there is little statistical evidence that these functions are significantly different .",
    "this combined low redshift xclf ( @xmath101 to 0.3 ) agrees well with that derived from the rass ( ebeling _ et al._1995 , 1996 ) and strongly suggests there is no evidence for xclf evolution below @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , a 2d ks test between this combined low @xmath120 xclf and the high @xmath120 xclf indicates that the significance of any evolution between the two is only 85% .",
    "if we compare the original low @xmath120 emss shell ( 0.14 to 0.2 ) with the high @xmath120 shell , the significance of any observed evolution only rises to @xmath121 .",
    "these findings are now consistent with those of @xcite .    at greater redshift ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "the data remains scarce , but at low cluster luminosities the xclf does not appear to be radically different . at high luminosities ( @xmath122 ) , the fact that the emss does not detect such clusters may be indicative of evolution .",
    "overall , figure 10 summaries our new determinations of the emss xclfs within the framework of other work in this field and , we believe , demonstrates that the significance of any claimed evolution with redshift can only be mild at best .",
    "several projects are already underway ( _ i.e. _ the sharc survey ; @xcite ) which will help clarify the situation by constructing larger samples of x  ray clusters from the rosat data ( both rass and archival data ) .",
