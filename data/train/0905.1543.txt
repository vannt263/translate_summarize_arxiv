    "characterizing the capacity region of wireless relay networks is one of the fundamental problems . however ,",

    "the works in @xcite have considered deterministic relay networks and the work in @xcite has studied finite - field erasure networks . since the channels are time - varying , destinations can decode their messages without interference by transmitting them through a series of particular channel instances during multihop transmission . as an example , consider the binary - field two - hop network in fig .",

    "the works in @xcite have also shown that , by using particular channel instances jointly , one can improve achievable rates of single - hop networks .",
