    "in the last decade , many theoretical works devoted to the study of plasma oscillations in three-(3d ) and two - dimensional(2d ) electron - hole structures . the plasma oscillations of the one component electron gas in the 3d bulk crystals [ 1 ] as well as in 2d layers characterized by the square of the frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the corresponding electron densities .",
    "das sarma and madhukar [ 2 ] considered the two - component 2d electron gas(2deg ) .",
    "two operators of the density fluctuations @xmath5 and @xmath6 corresponding to each layer combine in phase and in opposite phases forming the optical and acoustical plasmon oscillations with the frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the range of small wave vectors q. kasyan and coautors [ 3 , 4 ] investigated the interconnected plasmon - phonon excitations in 2d structures .",
    "excitations of the 2deg in a strong perpendicular magnetic field are completely different to the case discussed above in that the kinetic energy is suppressed by the landau quantization and magnetic field .",
    "girvin , macdonald and platzman [ 5 ] proposed a magnetoroton theory of collective elementary excitations in 2deg in conditions of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) .",
    "it occurs in low - disordered , high - mobility samples with partially filled lowest landau levels with filling factor of the form @xmath9 , where q is an integer @xmath10 . in this case",
    "the excitation is a collective effect arising from the many - body correlations due to coulomb interaction .",
    "decisive progress has been achieved by laughlin [ 6 ] toward understanding the nature of the many body ground state due his variational wave function .",
    "the theory of the collective excitation spectrum proposed by [ 5 ] is closed analogous to feynman s theory of superfluid helium [ 7 ] .",
    "the main feynman s arguments lead to the conclusion that on general ground the low lying excitations of any system will include density waves . in the case of filled landau level @xmath11 because of pauli exclusion principle the lowest excitations are necessarily the cyclotron modes in which particles are excited in the next landau levels .",
    "just this case was studied by kallin and halperin [ 8 ] . but in the case of fqhe the lowest landau level(lll ) is fractionally filled .",
    "the pauli principle no longer excludes low - energy intra - landau - level excitations . for the fqhe case",
    "the primary importance have the low - lying excitations , rather than the high - energy inter - landau - level cyclotron modes [ 5 ] . the energy spectrum obtained in [ 5 ]",
    "has an energy gap at zero wave vector @xmath12 .",
    "it exhibits a deep magnetoroton minimum at dimensionless wave vector @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the magnetic length , quite analogous to the roton minimum in helium .",
    "fertig [ 9 ] investigated the excitation spectrum of two - layer and three - layer electron systems .",
    "the case of two - layer system in a strong perpendicular magnetic field with filling factor @xmath15 of the llls of each layer was considered .",
    "the spontaneous coherence of two - component 2deg was introduced , which is equivalent to the bcs - type ground state of the superconductor .",
    "it represents the coherent pairing of the conduction electrons in one layer with the holes in the same conduction band of another layer .",
    "such unusual excitons are named as fqhe excitons .",
    "their excitations are expected to have the energies @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the energy of exciton with the wave vector @xmath18 .",
    "such result was obtained by paquet , rice and ueda [ 10 ] , who studied the electron - hole system in a single layer . in the asymmetric case ,",
    "when the distance between the layers is different from zero , the energy spectrum of elementary excitations is characterized by linear dependence on the wave vector in the region of long wavelengths as well by the roton type behavior at the intermediary values of wave vectors [ 9 ] . in the symmetric case , when the distance between the layers vanishes and the coulomb interactions inter - layers and intra - layers are the same , the linear region of the energy spectrum is transformed into the quadratic dependence .",
    "such type energy spectrum of elementary excitations in two - layer electron system was discussed also in the ref . [ 11 ] .",
    "moskalenko and coauthors [ 12 ] investigated the intra - landau level excitations of the 2d electron - hole liquid ( ehl ) under the influence strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "it was shown that such excitations are characterized by two branches of the energy spectrum .",
    "one of them is the acoustical plasmon type branch with the linear dispersion law in the range of small wave vectors and monotonically increasing with saturation behavior at higher wave vectors .",
    "the second branch of the elementary excitations is an optical - plasmon branch with quadratic dispersion law at small wave vectors with a roton - type dispersion at intermediary wave vectors and with a similar behavior as the acoustical branch at higher wave vectors . in [ 13 ]",
    "was considered the plasmon oscillations in the 2deg under influence the spin - orbit splitting .",
    "it was shown that transitions between different spin states produce narrow absorption band in the degenerate 2deg .",
    "as a result , the plasmon spectrum was modified in the new type of oscillations namely , a spin - plasmon polariton .",
    "xu and coautors [ 14 ] investigated influence the rashba spin - orbit interaction ( rsoi ) on the fast - electron optical spectrum of the 2deg .",
    "they found that for a spin - split 2deg , the spectrum of optical absorption is mainly induced by plasmon excitation via inter - so electronic transition . in [ 15 ]",
    "was proposed a concept of surface plasmon - polariton amplification in the structure comprising interface between dielectric , metal , and asymmetric quantum well .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the section ii the starting hamiltonian",
    "is introduced and the motion equations for the operators and green s function are deduced . in section",
    "iii the energy spectrum of the collective elementary excitations is obtained .",
    "section iv contains the conclusions .",

    "n equals to @xmath27 where s is the surface layer area and l is the magnetic length @xmath28 .",
