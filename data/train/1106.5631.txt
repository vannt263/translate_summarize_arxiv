    "the experimental observation @xcite of a hysteresis loop in the i / v characteristic of double - barrier resonant tunneling structures prompted intense theoretical activities to gain a microscopic understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "several authors have been able to reproduce the hysteresis behavior by treating the coulomb interaction at a mean field level @xcite .",
    "self - consistent calculations have revealed the presence of bistable solutions , one of the solution being characterized by a considerable accumulation of charge in the potential well .",
    "subsequent experimental work on double - barrier resonant tunneling diodes has , however , demonstrated that hysteresis loops do not always occur @xcite .",
    "the suppression of the intrinsic bistability has been attributed to exchange - correlation effects @xcite .    with the advent of molecular electronics @xcite the study of intrinsic bistability in nanoscale devices",
    "has gained attention due to the possibility of developing , for example , molecular diodes .",

    "was reported by negre _ et .",

    "the mechanism of bistability and the calculation of switching times between two different states are mostly unexplored and the question how correlations affect the bistability has received very scarce attention . the purpose of the present exploratory paper is twofold : to extend the analysis to the time - domain and to study the role of memory effects in a bistable interacting resonant level model ( irlm ) .",
    "two complementary theoretical approaches will be used for calculating the time - dependent current and density , namely time - dependent ( td ) dft and many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) .",
    "tddft @xcite provide an exact framework to account for correlation effects both in the leads and the central region @xcite .",
    "within tddft the basic quantities that are propagated in time are the one - particle orbitals which depend on only one time variable .",
    "this property renders the implementation computationally favorable @xcite .",
    "most approximations to the tddft potential , however , do not include memory effects and the exchange - correlation part is approximated by local or semi - local functionals of the density .",
    "the lack of more sophisticated approximations represents , at present , a major obstacle for an accurate first principle description of td quantum transport through interacting regions .",
    "mbpt has the advantage over tddft of allowing for a systematic inclusion of relevant physical processes through a selection of feynman diagrams .",
    "thus , mbpt provides an important tool to proceed beyond the commonly used adiabatic approximations and to quantify the importance of memory effects through advanced approximations to the self - energy .",
    "we recently proposed @xcite a time dependent mbpt formulation of quantum transport , based on the real - time propagation of the green function @xcite for open and interacting systems .",
    "first the dyson equation for the connected system is solved to self - consistency on the imaginary axis .",
    "after that the green function is propagated with the kadanoff - baym equations using different level of conserving approximations . as the green function depends on two time variables the implementation of the mbpt scheme is more demanding than that of the tddft scheme .",
    "we expect that the interplay between mbpt and tddft will be essential to develop accurate approximation for systems more complex than the one studied here .",
