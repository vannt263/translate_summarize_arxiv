    "intelligent transportation systems have gained significant importance in the recent past with various initiatives taken both by the federal and state transportation agencies in collaboration with the automotive industry .",
    "two major applications in this context are vehicular safety and autonomous driving .",
    "a key requirement for both these applications is precise , sub - meter vehicle localization @xcite typically enabled through ranging ( i.e. , distance estimation ) .",
    "existing technologies such as lidar @xcite or rtk - gps @xcite that provide such precise ranging have the drawback of being costly to deploy .",
    "there is hence a need for precise ranging solutions that are in addition cost effective and commercially viable . as a possible solution to this problem ,",
    "we explore in this work the use of affordable wifi hardware for obtaining precise range estimates between vehicles .",
    "the underlying concept of ranging using radio - frequency signals exploits that the propagation delay of the wireless signal from the transmitter to the receiver is proportional to their distance .",
    "time - of - arrival ( toa ) ranging @xcite typically assumes that the transmitter and receiver are time synchronized in order to calculate the propagation delay .",
    "time - difference - of - arrival ( tdoa ) ranging @xcite uses a small number of time - synchronized reference nodes allowing the other nodes in the system to obtain ranging measurements from these reference nodes without themselves being time synchronized .",
    "finally , round - trip - time ( rtt ) ranging @xcite eliminates the need for time synchronization by exchanges two messages between the transmitter and receiver , from which the common clock offset can be canceled .",
    "these two messages need to be exchanged within a short time interval , since otherwise clock drifts can introduce significant ranging errors .",
    "time synchronization is hard to achieve in vehicular applications particularly when the synchronization accuracy needs to be in the order of nanoseconds to achieve sub - meter level accuracy .",
    "this precludes the use of toa based ranging schemes .",
    "similarly , it may not be practical to establish synchronized reference nodes , which are needed for tdoa based schemes .",
    "rtt could be used to obtain relative range estimates between the vehicles . however , a unicast mechanism like rtt requires a significant number of message exchanges especially when the number of vehicles in the network is large",
    ". in particular , the number of messages scales _ quadratically _ with the number of vehicles .      in this work",
    ", we develop a broadcast mechanism for range estimation that can drastically reduce the number of required message exchanges .",
    "in particular , in our proposed scheme , the number of messages being broadcast scales only _ linearly _ with the number of vehicles .",
    "the broadcast mechanism is motivated by the dedicated short - range communications ( dsrc ) standard @xcite , which is a modification of the wifi standard .",
    "the dsrc standard prescribes periodic broadcasting of safety messages by every vehicle .",
    "we propose to use these broadcasted safety messages to perform ranging without the need for any additional messaging .",
    "our scheme does require additional information to be transmitted in each dsrc packet , and we introduce a compression mechanism to minimize this overhead .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * we develop an algorithm and protocol for range estimation between vehicles based on broadcast message exchanges wherein each vehicle periodically broadcasts a packet with certain timing information .",
    "using this periodic broadcast ranging approach , the number of required message exchanges scales only linearly with the number of vehicles as opposed to quadratically when using standard unicast rtt ranging .",
    "* the time interval between broadcast transmissions can be on the order of @xmath0 ms . as a consequence ,",
    "we need to explicitly account for the relative clock offset and clock drift between the vehicles .",
    "further we also need to account for the motion of the vehicles during this time interval .",
    "* we also propose a novel compression algorithm to efficiently quantize and transmit timestamp information in the broadcast packets in order to reduce the protocol overhead .",
    "this is particularly significant in the context of dsrc , in which packets have constrained payload size .",
    "* we conduct experiments using qualcomm - proprietary wifi hardware that supports ranging capabilities .",
    "we show that sub - meter level accuracies are achievable with the proposed algorithm .",
    "finally , the proposed algorithm suffers only a small loss in ranging performance as compared to rtt - based ranging .",
    "thus , the reduction from quadratic number of messages in rtt to linear number of messages in our proposed periodic broadcast ranging algorithm results in only a small loss in ranging performance .",
    "range estimation has been a topic of research interest for several decades starting with classical radar systems @xcite and gps @xcite to more recent technologies like wifi @xcite , bluetooth @xcite , and ultra - wide band @xcite to name a few .",
    "there is still active research in the community to develop inexpensive and precise ranging technologies that can work in various environments .",
    "these are enabling applications in the vehicular space @xcite , sensor networks @xcite , and robotics @xcite .",
    "gps works on the tdoa principle wherein the satellites are time synchronized .",
    "radar based systems typically work on the principle of electromagnetic reflection .",
    "the transmitted signal is reflected off a target object and the received reflected signal can be correlated with the transmitted signal to locate the target .",
    "some high - end cars have radar - like sensors that detect distances to obstacles and other vehicles . however , when multiple vehicles are present in the environment it is hard to distinguish between different reflectors .",
    "further , if all the vehicles transmit radar pulses without a synchronization protocol , then the resulting interference between the signals can degrade the ranging accuracy .",
    "rtt - based systems are popular and well studied in various contexts .",
    "the ieee 802.11mc task group defines a fine - timing - measurement ( ftm ) protocol @xcite for rtt ranging in the wifi signal spectrum .",
    "as described before , this eliminates the need for clock synchronization , but is inherently unicast in nature .",
    "there are quite a few works in the literature that consider the problem of range and location estimation in the presence of unknown clock offsets @xcite .",
    "most of these are in the context of location estimation , wherein the location of a node or a set of nodes needs to be estimated from ranging measurements .",
    "these works explore the joint estimation of locations and clock offsets .",
    "the problem of joint estimation of clock parameters and distances between pairs of mobile nodes is considered in @xcite , which makes use of the local smoothness of the node trajectories to solve for the unknown variables .",
    "we consider a collection of moving vehicles , each equipped with a radio transmitter and receiver , that emit periodic broadcast messages with approximate period of @xmath1 seconds .",
    "our goal is to estimate the distances between the vehicles using time of departure and arrival information from these broadcast messages .",
    "this scenario is motivated by the dsrc standard , in which vehicles broadcast so - called basic safety messages with an approximate period of @xmath2 s. we will use dsrc as a running example throughout this paper , however the results apply more generally .        for ease of presentation ,",
    "we restrict ourselves for now to a scenario with two vehicles , a local and a remote vehicle .",
    "the generalization to arbitrary number of vehicles is discussed in section  [ sec : main_multiple ] .",
    "we assume that the vehicle clocks are not synchronized .",
    "since the message departure and arrival times are measured with respect to each vehicle s own clock , we need to explicitly account for the relation between the two clocks .",
    "formally , we denote by @xmath3 and @xmath4 the departure times of the @xmath5th message sent by the local and remote vehicle , respectively . similarly , we denote by @xmath6 and @xmath7 the arrival times of these messages .",
    "these arrival and departure times are piggybacked on the broadcast messages as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeline ] .",
    "we assume that the local time @xmath8 and the remote time @xmath9 are related via the linear relationship @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the clock offset ( measured in seconds ) and @xmath12 is the clock drift ( a unitless quantity ) .",
    "typical values of @xmath12 are on the order of @xmath13 , which is usually expressed as a drift of @xmath14 parts per million ( ppm ) ; see also fig .  [",
    "fig : drift ] .     as a function of time .",
    "the experiment is carried out in a static setting , and the parameter @xmath12 is estimated by differencing consecutive measurements . ]    in the periodic broadcast ranging approach analyzed in this paper , the delay between a message departure and the following message arrival is on the order of @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the clock drift during this period is on the order of @xmath16 .",
    "for example , in the dsrc case with @xmath17 s , the drift of a @xmath14 ppm clock during that time is on the order of @xmath18 @xmath19s .",
    "when left uncompensated , this clock drift of @xmath18 @xmath19s will result in a ranging error of approximately @xmath20 m !    careful modeling and dealing with clock drifts is hence critical for successful ranging using the periodic broadcast approach .",
    "continuing with the dsrc example , assume we aim for a ranging accuracy on the order of @xmath21 m , then we can tolerate an uncompensated clock drift of at most @xmath22 ppm between successive samples .",
    "[ fig : drift ] suggests that we can therefore model the clock drift as being approximately constant for a window of a few seconds ( corresponding to a few tens of dsrc message exchanges ) . during this time , the model   with constant @xmath12 is valid .",
    "the departure and arrival timestamps can then be related as follows :    [ eq : trel ] @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the inter - vehicle distances at times @xmath3 and @xmath6 , where @xmath26 is the speed of light , and where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are additive receiver noise terms assumed to be with mean zero and variance @xmath29 .",
    "the timestamp relation   assumes that the vehicle movement and the clock drift are negligible during the packet time of flight between the two vehicles .",
    "since this time of flight is less than @xmath30 ns for vehicle distances less than @xmath0 m , this assumption is reasonable .",
    "the relation   links the departure and arrival timestamps to the inter - vehicle distances @xmath24 and @xmath25 . because of the movement of the vehicles , these distances are time - varying ( i.e. , change as a function of @xmath5 ) . a typical vehicle trajectory and the corresponding distances of the vehicle to the fixed receiver",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : movement ] .",
    "since the vehicle distances can change by several tens of meters per second , this time - varying nature of the distances needs again to be taken into account when using periodic packet broadcasts for ranging .",
    "for example , in dsrc with @xmath17 s , the change in distances can be on the order of several meters between successive message arrivals .",
    "recall from fig .",
    "[ fig : timeline ] that at time @xmath6 of the arrival of message @xmath5 at the local vehicle , this vehicle has access to all its own measured timestamps @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 . from the received messages , it has also access to the remotely measured timestamps @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37 ( note that , due to hardware limitations , @xmath4 is _ not _ available at the local vehicle at time @xmath6 ) . using this information ,",
    "our goal in the remainder of this paper is to estimate at time @xmath6 the distance @xmath25 between the vehicles at that time instant .",
    "one standard approach to measure distances between unsynchronized communication devices is to use unicast rtt based ranging . in this approach",
    ", a first communication device sends a unicast ranging request to a second communication device .",
    "the second communication device responds with a unicast acknowledgment . by measuring this round - trip time",
    ", the first device can then estimate the distance between the two devices .    in the formalism of this paper ,",
    "rtt ranging computes the distance estimate @xmath38 in typical rtt applications , the time @xmath39 between transmitting the ranging request and receiving the corresponding acknowledgment is small .",
    "for example , in the rtt - based wifi fine - timing measurement protocol , the delay between these two events is on the order of @xmath22 ms . assuming a @xmath12 of @xmath14 ppm , the clock drift during that time is on the order of @xmath40 ns , resulting in a ranging error of approximately @xmath41 cm , which is negligible for most applications .",
    "put differently , @xmath42 at the same time , the vehicular movement during those @xmath22 ms is at most @xmath40 cm , so that the change in distances over this period can be ignored as well .",
    "put differently , @xmath43 hence , for unicast rtt ranging , @xmath44 is an accurate estimate of the vehicular distances at time @xmath6 , and both drift and vehicular movement can be completely ignored .",
    "as already alluded to earlier , the situation changes completely for periodic broadcast ranging considered in this paper , where @xmath1 can be quite large . in the dsrc example , @xmath17 s. as a result the clock drift error term @xmath45 can be on the order of @xmath20 m , and the vehicular movement error term @xmath46 can be on the order of several meters .",
    "hence , the simple rtt range estimator   fails in the periodic broadcast setting , and more sophisticated estimators , explicitly taking into account clock drift and vehicular movement , are needed .",
    "we present such an estimator in the next section .",
    "we now describe an algorithm for ranging based on periodic broadcasts . the main estimation algorithm is presented in section  [ sec : main_poly ] .",
    "section  [ sec : main_compression ] proposes a compression scheme for the remote timestamps . how these algorithms can be extended to handle arbitrary number of vehicles",
    "is discussed in section  [ sec : main_multiple ] .",
    "recall from   that the local time @xmath8 and the remote time @xmath9 are related through a clock offset @xmath11 and a clock drift @xmath12 .",
    "the clock offset can be handled in a straightforward way by defining the timestamp differences @xmath47 observe that these quantities were chosen such that @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are all available at the local vehicle at time @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : timeline ] in section  [ sec : system ] ) .    the timestamp relation   can then be rewritten as    [ eq : dtrel ] @xmath52    with    [ eq : dz ] @xmath53    thus , the transformed measurements are invariant with respect to the clock offset @xmath11 .",
    "one could further transform the measurements to achieve invariance with respect to the clock drift @xmath12 as well ( see section  [ sec : main_compression ] ) .",
    "however , this would lead to significant noise amplification , and we instead opt to explicitly estimate the nuisance parameter @xmath12 .    as was pointed out in section  [ sec : system ] , the clock drift @xmath12 can be assumed to be constant during a window of a few seconds . from fig .",
    "[ fig : movement ] in section  [ sec : system ] , we see that during the same timescale the inter - vehicular distances vary smoothly .",
    "similar to @xcite , we make a polynomial approximation of the variation of these inter - vehicle distances as a function of time .",
    "due to the sharp peaks occurring when two vehicles pass each other , we choose the degree of this local polynomial approximation to be two .",
    "formally , we are thus making the approximation    [ eq : poly ] @xmath54    fix a window size @xmath55 , and assume both the clock drift and the distance approximations are valid over @xmath55 time periods . from   and  , the polynomial coefficients @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the nuisance parameter @xmath12 can then be estimated via least - squares as the minimizer @xmath59 of @xmath60    this equation can be rewritten in matrix form as @xmath61 with @xmath62 and where we have used the notation @xmath63 the minimizer of this least - squares problem is @xmath64 from which we can recover the desired distance estimate @xmath65 as we will see next , this estimate can be improved upon by taking the correlated nature of the transformed ranging noise into account .",
    "recall from   that the transformed noise @xmath66 and @xmath67 is no longer white .",
    "in fact , setting @xmath68 and @xmath69 we can write @xmath70 with @xmath71 hence , @xmath72    thus , @xmath73 whitens the transformed ranging noise .",
    "the corresponding whitened least - squares problem is @xmath74 with solution @xmath75 the estimate @xmath76 can be recovered from this as before ( see ) .",
    "the computation of @xmath76 is performed at the local vehicle at each time step @xmath5 to estimate the distance @xmath25 from the remote vehicle at the current time @xmath6 .",
    "we point out that all measurements required to perform the computation of the estimate @xmath76 are available at the local vehicle at time @xmath6 .     monte - carlo simulations ) as a function of time for several fixed window sizes .",
    "the top figure shows the corresponding actual distances.,title=\"fig : \" ]   monte - carlo simulations ) as a function of time for several fixed window sizes .",
    "the top figure shows the corresponding actual distances.,title=\"fig : \" ]    since we are estimating four parameters , and since there are two measurements at each time step , the window size @xmath55 needs to be at least two for the matrix @xmath77 to be invertible .",
    "larger values of @xmath55 result in larger noise suppression . on the other hand ,",
    "too large a value of @xmath55 will lead to biased estimates due to model mismatch ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : window ] ) . for the setting considered in this paper ,",
    "a window size of @xmath78 is a reasonable choice .        by performing experiments with known vehicle distances , the ranging noise terms @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath27 can be directly measured .",
    "[ fig : qqplot ] shows the q - q plot for the ranging noise , comparing the empirical ranging noise quantiles to the quantiles of a standard normal distribution .",
    "for gaussian ranging noise , the points in the q - q plot should be linearly related .",
    "[ fig : qqplot ] indicates that the ranging noise is well modeled by a gaussian random variable except for the right tail , where the ranging noise exhibits significant outliers .",
    "these outliers are caused by non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) range measurements , in which the direct path between the transmitter and the receiver is obstructed , and the signal is instead observed via a longer path containing reflections . dealing with these large nlos outliers is hence critical , as will be discussed next .",
    "local polynomial regression can be made more robust to such nlos outliers by carrying out the least - squares procedure several times and reducing the weight of those observations with large residuals  @xcite .",
    "formally , denote by @xmath79 the vector of residuals in  .",
    "compute the median @xmath80 of @xmath81 and the robustness weights @xmath82 then recompute a weighted least - squares solution with weights @xmath83 .",
    "this procedure is repeated a few times . for our setting , five repetitions yielded good performance .",
    "recall from fig .",
    "[ fig : timeline ] in section  [ sec : system ] that the departure and arrival timestamps @xmath4 and @xmath7 are transmitted from the remote to the local vehicle and similarly for the timestamps @xmath3 and @xmath6 from the local to the remote vehicle .",
    "while for ranging between two vehicles the number of bits that need to be transmitted is manageable , this may no longer be the case when distances need to be estimated frequently and between many vehicles .",
    "as an example , consider again the vehicular dsrc standard ( which is a variant of wifi as mentioned before ) .",
    "the periodic broadcast messages are called basic safety messages ( bsm ) in the dsrc standard .",
    "each such bsm has a size of @xmath84 bytes ( in the simplest form ) @xcite .",
    "now , consider a scenario with @xmath85 cars within radio range of each other , whose relative distances we aim to estimate",
    ". a scenario of this size could easily arise in a multi - lane highway setting , for example .",
    "each vehicle then needs to piggyback @xmath85 timestamps on each of its broadcast messages ( one time of departure from its previously broadcast message , and @xmath86 times of arrival of the broadcast messages of the other cars , see also the discussion in section  [ sec : main_multiple ] ) .",
    "the ftm protocol of the wifi standard allocates @xmath87 bits to the transmission of each of these arrival and departure timestamps quantized to a resolution of @xmath40 ns @xcite .",
    "this results in a total of @xmath88 bytes of data that need to be piggybacked on the broadcast message .",
    "thus , the timestamp overhead to enable the ranging is comparable to the size of the original bsm packet itself .    in this section ,",
    "we discuss a method to compress the measured timestamps to reduce the overhead of communicating them .",
    "the proposed method achieves this compression by making use of prior positional information .",
    "specifically , by using previously received and measured timestamps and by assuming that the vehicles are moving at some bounded speed .",
    "the compression of the timestamps is performed by discarding their most - significant bits .",
    "the intuition is that since each vehicle is getting periodic ranging and position estimates from the neighboring vehicle , an approximate distance estimate at the current time is known .",
    "this approximate distance information allows to reconstruct the most - significant timestamp bits .",
    "it is only the lower - order bits that are needed to enhance the estimation accuracy , and which consequently need to be transmitted .",
    "formally , denote by @xmath89 $ ] the compressed timestamp corresponding to @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath90 \\defeq 10^{10}\\cdot{\\delta s_a}(n ) \\bmod 2^l,\\ ] ] for some fixed positive integer @xmath91 to be specified later .",
    "assuming that @xmath49 is measured in integer multiples of @xmath40 nanoseconds , then the quantity @xmath89 $ ] can be encoded using @xmath91 bits .",
    "these @xmath91 bits are then transmitted from the remote to the local vehicle .",
    "to recover @xmath49 from @xmath89 $ ] , observe that @xmath92+k_a(n ) 2^l\\ ] ] for some integer @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the aim of the local vehicle is to find @xmath93 . to this end , we make use of the fact that , by  , @xmath94 so that @xmath95 where the approximation is that @xmath96 , i.e. , that the intervals between broadcast transmissions are approximately constant .",
    "if the relative speed of vehicle movement is bounded , and having probabilistic bounds on the behavior of the ranging noise , this implies that @xmath97 with high probability for some positive constant @xmath98 . for a concrete example , in the dsrc context , @xmath17 s and we can assume a relative vehicle speed of at most @xmath0 m / s .",
    "further , assume a ranging noise @xmath66 of less then @xmath99 , corresponding to a ranging error on the order of @xmath14 m. then , @xmath100 ( a unitless quantity ) .",
    "assume for the moment that @xmath101 and hence also @xmath102 are known , and we want to recover @xmath93 .",
    "this can be achieved by finding the value of @xmath103 such that @xmath104+\\hat{k}_a(n)2^l}{10^{10}\\cdot{\\delta t_d}(n ) } \\approx \\frac{{\\delta s_a}(n-1)}{{\\delta t_d}(n-1)}.\\ ] ] or , put differently , @xmath105\\bigr)/2^l       \\bigg\\rceil,\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath106 rounds its argument to the closest integer .",
    "observe that @xmath48 and @xmath107 are available at the local vehicle since they are locally measured and @xmath102 is available by assumption .",
    "from   we see that if @xmath108 then @xmath109 is equal to @xmath93 , and we can recover @xmath49 from its compressed value @xmath89 $ ] .",

    "thus , instead of transmitting @xmath87 bits as in the ftm standard , we only need @xmath112 bits with the proposed compression method . in our experiments ,",

    "note that the time delay between the ftm request and the alternate ack s is on the order of @xmath132 ms .",
    "thus the effects of clock drifts will be prominently seen in the timestamps and need to be accounted for .",
    "further , this method also helps us to compute distance estimates using rtt based ranging for a baseline comparison by using the acks that are immediately sent for every ftm request .",
    "all measurements were carried out at a bandwidth of @xmath133 mhz which is the largest wifi band supported by the mdp device .",
    "the received signal is then filtered to different lower bandwidths to compare the ranging accuracy as a function of the bandwidth .",
    "the ground - truth device consists of a novatel gps module that has a specification of decimeter accuracy in open sky environments .",
    "this device was mounted on the vehicle after initially determining the ground truth of the static mdp .",
    "the ground - truth device provides location fixes at a rate of @xmath0 per second .",
    "these are downsampled to match the rate of range estimates obtained from the mdp .",
    "an important issue that needed to be resolved when using the ground - truth data was that of the time synchronization between the estimates obtained from the ground - truth device and those from the mdp .",
    "note that the ground - truth device provides measurements timestamped in both its own local clock and in gps time .",
    "the mdp devices however can only provide measurements timestamped in their local clock . to address this synchronization issue ,",
    "a python script was used to query the ground - truth device and the mdp board from a single laptop and timestamps were attached to the measurements in this local clock .",
    "this provides synchronization up to a few tens of milliseconds which is still comparable to the time duration between the measurements . in the post - processing stage a constant fixed delay between the ground truth and mdp measurements was therefore manually adjusted to minimize the alignment error .",
    "the trajectory of the vehicle motion is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmaptraj ] .",
    "the driving environment is largely strong line - of - sight ( los ) except at certain locations where the signal could be blocked by light poles or trees .",
    "there are also reflections from the ground and other parked cars that can degrade the estimation accuracy at lower bandwidths .",

    "one can see that the average errors during the first @xmath85 s are well within half a meter .",
    "there are some large errors mostly between the time instants @xmath134 s and @xmath135 s. these correspond to the locations where the car was driving in front of the building as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmaptraj ] .",
    "there are some light poles , trees and other parked cars that contribute to multipath ( between @xmath136 s and @xmath135 s ) and packet loss ( between @xmath137 s and @xmath134 s ) .",
    "in particular , large multipath errors in this time frame are potentially caused by signal reflection from the building adjacent to the car trajectory .",

    "[ fig : broadcast80 ] shows a comparison of the errors between the proposed periodic broadcast ranging ( pbr ) scheme and the ground truth .",
    "one can see that the average errors during the first @xmath85 s are again well within half a meter .",
    "thus the proposed algorithm is able to estimate the clock drift fairly accurately ( recall that these can result in errors of more than @xmath20 m if not taken care of ) .",
    "the plot looks smoother than rtt due to the local polynomial approximation .",
    "further this approach also eliminates some of the multipath errors due to the local polynomial constraint wherein outliers are rejected .",
    "for example , consider the multipath error in fig .",
    "[ fig : unicast ] occurring around time @xmath138 s. this is eliminated in the pbr scheme .",
    "however the other multipath errors are not eliminated since these occur in bursts , particularly the one close to @xmath135 s. further , the proposed scheme also has errors in certain cases where there are packet losses and the local polynomial prediction can be erroneous .",

    "the received @xmath133 mhz signal is an ofdm symbol with @xmath142 frequency tones .",
    "this is downsampled to @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 tones to generate signals occupying @xmath136 mhz , @xmath85 mhz , and @xmath14 mhz , respectively .",
    "the time - of - arrival is then estimated based on these downsampled signals . note that a factor of two reduction in the bandwidth increases the pulse width in time by a factor of two , thereby the accuracy is roughly expected to degrade by a factor of two particularly when we have multipath .",
    "this effect is observed in our results as well .",

    "the overall average error at the @xmath135 percentile is around @xmath41 m as seen from the cdf curves . in the linear section of the vehicle trajectory between @xmath14 s and @xmath85 s ,",
    "the errors are below @xmath141 m. in this case , there was clear los between the two mdps as opposed to the rest of the trajectory , during which either other parked vehicles or obstructions like light poles resulted in larger errors due to multipath .",
    "in this work , we investigated the problem of range estimation between vehicles using periodic broadcast transmissions .",
    "we proposed a broadcast ranging algorithm that achieves accuracies comparable to unicast rtt based ranging .",
    "thus , the number of message exchanges needed for ranging can be reduced from scaling quadratically in the number of vehicles for the unicast approach to only linearly in the broadcast approach with only a small loss in ranging performance .",
    "key challenges in broadcast ranging are the presence of clock offsets , clock drifts , and vehicle motion that need to be accounted for .",
