    "<S> the na60 experiment has studied low - mass muon pairs production in proton - nucleus collisions at 400 gev/@xmath0 at the cern sps . </S>",
    "<S> the mass spectrum is well described by the superposition of the two - body and dalitz decays of the light neutral mesons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the large collected statistics allows to isolate the contributions due to the dalitz decays of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons , from which the electromagnetic transition form factors of the two mesons have been extracted . </S>",
    "<S> the found values agree with the previous available measurements , improving their uncertainty thanks to the higher statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the results thus confirm the discrepancy with the prediction of the vector meson dominance model in the case of the electromagnetic form factor of the @xmath3 meson .    </S>",
    "<S> proton - nucleus studies have been part of the heavy - ion experimental program at the cern sps , of which the na60 experiment represents the most recent and one of the most fruitful efforts . beyond serving as a robust reference baseline for the heavy - ion data , </S>",
    "<S> proton - nucleus data also stimulate a genuine physics interest , allowing measurements in an environment of cold nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> this is in fact the case of the electromagnetic transition form factors of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons , which have been studied here through their dalitz decays @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in these @xmath8 processes , the mesons decay electromagnetically into a virtual photon with mass @xmath9 @xmath10 in turn converting into a lepton pair @xmath10 and a third body . assuming point - like particles , the mass distribution of the emitted lepton pair ( that is , the decay rate of the process as a function of @xmath9 ) can be exactly described by qed as firstly shown by n.m .  </S>",
    "<S> kroll and w.  wada  @xcite in the 1950s .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed mass distribution for the lepton pairs emitted in an @xmath8 decay differs from the point - like one , because of the internal electromagnetic structure of the decaying meson , which reveals at the vertex of the transition @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this difference can be formally described by a function of @xmath9 , usually expressed as @xmath12 , known as _ transition form factor_. experimentally , @xmath12 is directly accessible by comparing the measured invariant mass spectrum of the lepton pairs from the dalitz decays , with the point - like qed prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the transition form factors are usually given in terms of the pole parametrization : @xmath13 the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model gives theoretical predictions both for @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions have been tested by the lepton - g experiment @xcite using pion beams , and recently by the na60 experiment in in - in peripheral collisions @xcite . while the experimental values agree among each other both for the @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons , only the vmd model prediction for the @xmath1 meson </S>",
    "<S> is confirmed by the data , while the one for the @xmath3 meson is not , strongly underestimating the observed form factor . </S>",
    "<S> the na60 p - a data can now give a further significant contribution to the measurement , thanks to the high quality and the large statistics available .     + </S>",
    "<S> a description of the na60 apparatus can be found for example in @xcite . here , only few relevant details are given . </S>",
    "<S> the produced dimuons are identified and measured by the muon spectrometer , composed of a set of tracking stations , trigger scintillator hodoscopes , a toroidal magnet and a hadron absorber . </S>",
    "<S> the stopping of hadrons ( provided by more than 20 interactions lengths ) allows to select the highly rare dimuon events . on the other hand , the material which stops the hadrons also induces multiple scattering and energy loss on the muons , degrading the mass resolution of the measurement made in the spectrometer . to overcome this problem , </S>",
    "<S> na60 already measures the muons before the absorber with a tracking telescope , made of pixel silicon detectors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the muon tracks are found among the many other charged particle tracks by a correct matching , both in angular and momentum coordinates , with the reconstructed tracks in the muon spectrometer .   </S>",
    "<S> + the preliminary results presented here are obtained from the analysis of the data collected during three days within the 2004 proton run , with a system of nine sub - targets of different nuclear species , simultaneously exposed to an incident 400  gev proton beam . </S>",
    "<S> the first step of the analysis is a fit of the reconstructed mass spectrum ( see  [ fig : massspectrum ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fit is performed comparing the data with the superposition of the expected sources ( estimated via the mc ) . </S>",
    "<S> these sources are the dalitz decays of the @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons , the 2-body decays of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 and the contribution of the open charm process . before the comparison between data and mc </S>",
    "<S> is performed , the small component of combinatorial background ( originating from @xmath16 and @xmath17 decays ) is subtracted from the real data : its shape is estimated with an event mixing technique , while its normalization is established fixing the ls ( like - sign ) component coming out from the mixing , to the ls component of the data ( containing no signal from correlated pairs at the sps energies ) . the background accounts for less than @xmath18 of the integrated mass spectrum below 1.4  gev@xmath19 . the comparison between mixed and real sample gives an average uncertainty of @xmath18 , for both the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 components : given the rather low level of the combinatorial background contribution , this uncertainty hardly affects the evaluation of the shape for the dalitz decays under study . </S>",
    "<S> the processes which are not of interest for the measurement of the form factors of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 are then subtracted from the real data , using the normalizations fixed by the fit . </S>",
    "<S> only the dalitz decays of @xmath1 and @xmath3 are retained , together with the two - body decay of the @xmath2 : this latter is left in , making it much easier to control the systematics due to the small contribution coming from the low - mass tail of the @xmath2 in the mass region of interest here . </S>",
    "<S> the mass spectrum resulting after the subtraction is then corrected for the effects of geometrical acceptance and reconstruction efficiency . in order to do this , a correction profile as a function of the mass </S>",
    "<S> is built , weighting the profiles obtained from the mc for the three processes separately . </S>",
    "<S> after the correction for the acceptance  @xmath22  efficiency effects , the resulting mass spectrum @xmath10 now free from any acceptance distortion @xmath10 is compared with the superposition of the expected line shapes of the three processes @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .     +  [ fig : formfactors ] shows the fit on the acceptance - corrected mass spectrum ( black triangles ) , having isolated the contribution of the three processes @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the fit function is a superposition of the expected line shapes for the three processes , described by the following functions :    @xmath26      @xmath28    in the fit , the following parameters are left free :    * the three normalizations , one for each of the line shapes above * the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , contained in the form factors @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    concerning the line shape for the @xmath25 decay , the parameters @xmath33 ( entering in the definition of @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 and the effective temperature @xmath36 are fixed respectively to @xmath37  mev ( from the pdg ) , @xmath38  mev/@xmath39 ( also from the pdg ) and @xmath40  mev ( consistent with the expected value obtained by statistical model fits on particle ratios in @xmath41 interactions ) . </S>",
    "<S> all the parameters involved in the analysis procedure have been varied to study their influence on the fits and determine the systematic uncertainties on the results : the weights defining the acceptance@xmath22efficiency correction , the fit range ( and the choice of the free parameters ) , the value for the @xmath42 ratio , the charge correlation parameter for the combinatorial background and finally the level of the open charm contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis leads to the following values : @xmath43 once the final fit parameters and their errors are fixed , the contributions of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 processes are disentangled , making it then possible to present the two form factors in the usual way , in order to compare them with the previous experimental points , see  [ fig : formfactorsdisentagled ] . the pole parameters and their errors as obtained from the combined fit to both dalitz decays </S>",
    "<S> are shown as inserts . </S>",
    "<S> both figures include the na60 data obtained in peripheral  in - in , the lepton - g data , and the expectations from vmd for comparison . within the errors , </S>",
    "<S> perfect agreement between the three data sets is seen in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> irrespective of the much reduced errors , the form factor of the @xmath1 is still close to the expectation from vmd . </S>",
    "<S> the form factor of the @xmath3 , on the other hand , strongly deviates from the vmd , showing a relative increase close to the kinematic cut - off by a factor of @xmath44 .     </S>",
    "<S> fit on the acceptance - corrected mass spectrum . </S>",

    "<S> + in conclusion , we have presented a new measurement of the electromagnetic transition form factors of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons . the analysis has been performed by studying the dalitz decays @xmath45 and @xmath46 in p - a collisions at 400  gev/@xmath0 with the na60 apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> the new preliminary values presented here are in good agreement with those already available ; improving the precision of the measure by a factor @xmath47 , they confirm on more solid grounds the discrepancy between the vmd prediction for the @xmath3 and the experimental observations . </S>"
