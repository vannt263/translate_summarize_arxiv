    "physicists have long realized the importance of the earth s magnetic field and that this field originates in the earth s fluid core .",
    "the geodynamo is the process by which the rotating , convecting , electrically conducting molten iron in the earth s fluid core maintains the geomagnetic field against ohmic decay .",
    "the convective processes in the core that produce the velocity fields required for dynamo action are a combination of thermal and compositional convection .",
    "the full dynamo problem requires the examination of the full three dimensional partial differential equations governing convective , incompressible magnetohydrodyamics ( mhd ) . in the past decades",
    "computer models have been used to simulate the actual geodynamo . however , current computers and numerical methods require the imposition of diffusivities that are several orders of magnitude larger than those which are realistic .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to attempt to gain some insight into the geodynamo by considering a reduction of the full mhd equations to a system that is more tractable , but one that retains many of the essential features of the problem .",
    "the magnetogeostrophic equation proposed by moffatt and loper ( @xcite-@xcite ) is one such model .",
    "the physical postulates of this model are the following : slow cooling of the earth leads to slow solidification of the liquid metal core onto the solid inner core and releases latent heat of solidification that drives compositional convection in the fluid core .",
    "the arguments for the appropriate ranges of the characteristic length , velocity , and perturbation density are based on these physical postulates .",
    "we first present the full coupled three - dimensional mhd equations for the evolution of the velocity vector @xmath0 , the magnetic field vector @xmath10 and the buoyancy ( or temperature ) field @xmath1 in the boussinesq approximation and written in the frame of reference rotating with angular velocity @xmath11 .",
    "the physical forces governing this system are coriolis forces , lorentz forces , and gravity . following the notation of moffatt and loper @xcite we write the equations in terms of dimensionless variables .",
    "the orders of magnitude of the resulting nondimensional parameters are motivated by the physical postulates of the moffatt and loper model :    @xmath12&=-\\nabla p+e_2\\cdot\\nabla b+r_m b\\cdot\\nabla b+n^2\\theta e_3+\\varepsilon_\\nu \\delta u,\\label{1.1 - 1}\\\\ r_m[\\partial_t b+u\\cdot\\nabla b - b\\cdot\\nabla u]&=e_2\\cdot\\nabla u+\\delta b,\\label{1.1 - 2}\\\\ \\partial_t\\theta+u\\cdot\\nabla\\theta&=\\varepsilon_\\kappa\\delta\\theta+s,\\label{1.1 - 3}\\\\ \\nabla\\cdot u&=0,\\nabla\\cdot b=0\\label{1.1 - 4}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath13 is a given smooth function that represents the forcing of the system .",
    "the mathematical statement of the geodynamo problem asks whether there are initial data for the mhd system for which the evolution of the perturbation of the magnetic field @xmath14 grows for sufficiently long time .",
    "this can be interpreted as a question of the existence of instabilities of - .",
    "the notation in - is the following .",
    "the cartesian unit vectors are denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that the axis of rotation and the gravity @xmath17 are aligned in the direction of @xmath16 .",
    "we have assumed that the magnetic field @xmath10 consists of the sum of an underlying constant field @xmath18 and a perturbation @xmath14 .",
    "our choice of @xmath18 as the underlying magnetic field is consistent with the models where the magnetic field is believed to be predominantly toroidal ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the dimensionless parameters in - are @xmath19 ( the inverse elsasser number ) , @xmath20 ( the rossby number ) , @xmath21 ( the magnetic reynolds number ) , @xmath22 ( the inverse square of the hartman number ) and @xmath23 ( the inverse peclet number ) . the definitions of these numbers in terms of the relevant dimensionless quantities are given in @xcite where the authors argue that in the region of the fluid core that they are modeling the parameters have the following orders of magnitude : @xmath19 is order unity while @xmath20 is order @xmath24 and @xmath21 is relatively small .",
    "the moffatt and loper model neglects the terms multiplied by @xmath20 and @xmath21 in comparison with the remaining terms .",
    "essentially this means that the evolution equations for the velocity and magnetic field take a simplified `` quasi - static '' form and are linear in the perturbation vector fields @xmath0 and @xmath14 .",
    "the diffusion parameters @xmath22 , which is proportional to the viscosity @xmath25 , and @xmath23 , which is proportional to the thermal diffusivity @xmath26 , are plausibly extremely small .",
    "however their roles are to multiply the laplacian which is the highest spatial derivatives in the system and these terms are retained in the model .    in the moffatt - loper model the dominant balance of the leading order terms in equations - gives the following reduced system    @xmath27    the linear system - determines the differential operators that relate the vector fields @xmath0 and @xmath14 with the scalar buoyancy ( or temperature ) @xmath1 .",
    "these operators encode the vestiges of the physics in the problem , namely coriolis force , lorentz force , and gravity .",
    "vector manipulations of - give the expression @xmath28",
    "^ 2+n^4(e_3\\cdot\\nabla)^2\\delta\\right\\}u =- n^2[\\varepsilon_\\nu\\delta^2-(e_2\\cdot\\nabla)^2]&\\nabla\\times(e_3\\times\\nabla\\theta)\\notag\\\\ \\qquad&+n^4(e_3\\cdot\\nabla)\\delta(e_3\\times\\nabla\\theta).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sole remaining nonlinearity in the system comes from the coupling of with the equation for the time evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "we call this nonlinear active scalar equation the _ magnetogeostrophic _ ( mg ) equation .",
    "the physically relevant boundary for a model of the earth s fluid core is a spherical annulus .",
    "however for the purposes of studying the mathematical properties of the mg equations we consider the more tractable case of the active scalar equation in the domain @xmath29 ^ 3\\times(0,\\infty)$ ] ( i.e. with periodic boundary conditions ) . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that @xmath30 for all @xmath31 , since the mean of @xmath32 is conserved by the flows .",
    "we study the active scalar equation @xmath33,\\theta(x,0)=\\theta_0(x ) \\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] via an examination of the fourier multiplier operator @xmath34 obtained from , which relates @xmath35 and @xmath32 .",

    "we point out that @xmath45 and hence the velocity field @xmath35 given by is indeed divergence - free .    in a series of recent papers (",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) properties were proved for the _ inviscid _ mg equation ( i.e. the system - when the viscosity @xmath22 is set to zero ) . in this case",
    "the fourier multiplier symbols @xmath46 , given by - with @xmath47 are not bounded in all regions of fourier space . more specifically in `` curved '' regions where @xmath48 , @xmath49 the symbols are unbounded as @xmath50 with @xmath51 for some positive constant @xmath52 .",
    "thus the relation between the velocity field @xmath35 and the scalar @xmath32 is given by a _",
    "singular _ operator of order 1 .",
    "the implications of this fact for the inviscid mg equation are summarized in the survey paper friedlander - rusin - vicol @xcite . in particular , it is proved that when the thermal diffusivity @xmath23 is set to zero , the inviscid mg equation is _ ill - posed _ in the sense of hadamard in sobolev spaces .",
    "in contrast when @xmath7 , the inviscid but thermally dissipative mg equation is globally well - posed .",
    "in this present article we study the _ viscous _ mg equation ( i.e. @xmath53 ) .",
    "the situation is then dramatically different because the operator @xmath34 whose symbols are given by - now is bounded on @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus the constitutive law for the _ viscous _ mg model produces two orders of smoothing .",
    "we remark that the mg equations fall into a hierarchy of active scalar equations arising in fluid dynamics in terms of the nature of the operator that produces the drift velocity from the scalar field :    1 .   for the inviscid mg equation the operator is singular of order 1",
    ". 2 .   for the surface quasi - geostrophic equation",
    "the operator is the riesz transform which is singular of order zero .",
    "3 .   for the 2d euler equation in vorticity form the operator is smoothing of degree one .",
    "4 .   for the viscous mg equation the operator is smoothing of degree two .    in this sense",
    "the viscous mg equation , even without thermal diffusion , is `` better behaved '' than the 2d euler equation . in the following sections of this article we will prove strong properties of the system - that are a consequence of this fact .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , we state the main results of this article which are summarized in various theorems . in section  3 , we introduce some notations and recall some useful embeddings which can be found in the literature . in section 4 , we study the case when @xmath2 . we prove that initial data @xmath56 implies the existence of unique , global weak solutions ; while for @xmath57 we obtain the single exponential growth in time on @xmath58 . in section  5 , we consider the thermally dissipative case ( @xmath7 ) and prove that the solution @xmath59 exists for all time .",
    "in particular , we show that the solution is instantaneously @xmath8-smoothed out and in the class @xmath60 for all positive time with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in section  6",
    ", we address the convergence of @xmath63 as @xmath23 approaches to zero . under the assumption that @xmath56 , the sequence of solutions @xmath64 to - with @xmath7 converges to @xmath1 weakly in @xmath65 for all @xmath9 , where @xmath1 is the solution to - when @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath66 , then for all @xmath67 , the term @xmath68 tends to zero as @xmath69 . in section 7 , we illustrate some dynamical features of the _ forced _ mg equation by demonstrating that the moffalt and loper model can sustain very rapid exponentially growing instabilities .",
    "we examine perturbations of a background temperature gradient and we construct unstable eigenvalues in the spectrum of the linearized equation .",
    "we use a suitable modification of the method of continued fractions first introduced in the context of the navier - stokes equations by meshalkin and sinai @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy of the mg symbols @xmath70 given by ( 1.10)-(1.13 ) permits eigenvalues that are very large when the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are extremely small .",
    "we now give a precise formulation of our results .",
