    "the nuclear matter , i.e. the infinite system of interacting nucleons was introduced in order to simplify the problem of investigation of finite nuclei . by introducing the nuclear matter the problems of @xmath0 interaction in medium with non - zero baryon density and those of individual features of specific nuclei were separated . however , the problem of the nuclear matter is far from being solved .",
    "as we understand now , it can not be solved in consistent way , being based on conception of @xmath0 interactions only .",
    "this is because the short distances , where we can not help considering nucleons as composite particles , are very important .",
    "there is limited data on the in - medium values of nucleon parameters .",
    "these are the quenching of the nucleon mass @xmath1 and of the axial coupling constant @xmath2 at the saturation value @xmath3 with respect to their vacuum values .",
    "the very fact of existing of the saturation point @xmath3 is also the `` experimental data '' , which is the characteristics of the matter as a whole .",
    "the nowadays models succeeded in reproducing the phenomena although the quantitative results differ very often .    on the other hand , the knowledge about the evolution of hadron parameters is important for understanding the evolution of the medium as a whole while the density @xmath4 of distribution of the baryon charge number increases .",
    "( when @xmath4 is small enough , it is just the density of the distribution of nucleons ) .",
    "there can be numerous phase transitions . at certain value of density @xmath5",
    "the fermi momenta of the nucleons will be so large , that it will be energetically favourable to increase @xmath4 by adding heavier baryons instead of new nucleons .",
    "the nuclear or , more generally , hadronic matter may accumulate excitations with the pion quantum numbers , known as pion ( or even kaon ) condensations . also the matter can transform to the mixture of hadrons and quark - gluon phase or totally to the quark - gluon plasma , converting thus to baryon matter .",
    "the last but not the least is the chiral phase transition .",
    "the chiral invariance is assumed to be one of the fundamental symmetries of the strong interactions .",
    "the chiral invariance means that the lagrangian as well as the characteristics of the system are not altered by the transformation @xmath6 of the fermion fields @xmath7 .",
    "the model , suggested by nambu and jona - lasinio ( njl ) @xcite provides a well - known example .",
    "the model describes the massless fermions with the four - particle interactions . in the simplest version of njl model",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath8\\ .\\ ] ] if the coupling constant @xmath9 is large enough , the mathematical ( empty ) vacuum is not the ground state of the system . due to the strong four - fermion interaction in the dirac sea",
    "the minimum of the energy of the system is reached at a nonzero value of the fermion density .",
    "this is the physical vacuum corresponding to the expectation value @xmath10 .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking '' . in the physical vacuum",
    "the fermion obtains the mass @xmath11 caused by the interaction with the condensate . on the other hand",
    ", the expectation value @xmath12 is expressed through the integral over the dirac sea of the fermions .",
    "of course , we have to introduce a cutoff @xmath13 to prevent the ultraviolet divergence caused by the four - fermion interaction @xmath14 thus eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) compose self - consistent set of equations which determine the values of the condensate and of fermion mass @xmath1 in the physical vacuum .",
    "originally the njl model was suggested for the description of the nucleons .",
    "nowadays it is used for the quarks .",
    "the quark in the mathematical vacuum , having either vanishing or very small mass is called the `` current '' quark .",
    "the quark which obtained the mass , following eq.(2 ) is called the `` constituent '' quark . in the nonrelativistic quark model",
    "the nucleon consists of three constituent quarks only .",
    "return to the nuclear matter . to understand , which of the hadron parameters are important , note that we believe nowadays most of the strong interaction phenomena at low and intermediate energies to be described by using effective low - energy pion - nucleon or pion - constituent quark lagrangians .",
    "the @xmath15 coupling constant is : @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the pion decay constant .",
    "this is the well - known goldberger- treiman ( gt ) relation @xcite .",
    "it means , that the neutron beta decay can be viewed as successive strong decay of neutron to @xmath18 system and the decay of the pion .",
    "thus , except the nuclear mass @xmath19 , the most important parameters will be the in - medium values @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand , the baryonic matter as a whole is characterised by the values of the condensates , i.e. by the expectation values of quark and gluon operators .",
    "even at @xmath23 some of the condensates do not vanish , due to the complicated structure of qcd vacuum .",
    "the nonzero value of the scalar quark condensate @xmath12 reflects the violation of the chiral symmetry . in the exact chiral limit , when @xmath24 ( and the current quark masses vanish also ) , the nucleon mass vanishes too .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to think about the effective nucleon mass @xmath19 and about the other parameters as the functions of the condensates .",
    "of course , the values of the condensates change in medium .",
    "also , some condensates which vanish in vacuum may have the nonzero value at finite density .    at the same time , while calculating the expectation value of the quark operator @xmath25 in medium , one finds that the contribution of the pion cloud depends on the in - medium values of hadron parameters .",
    "hence , the parameters depend on condensates and vice versa .",
    "thus we came to the idea of self - consistent calculation of hadron parameters and of the values of condensates in medium .",
    "the idea of self - consistency is , of course , not a new one .",
    "we have seen just now , how njl model provides an example .",
    "we shall try to apply the self - consistent approach to the analysis of more complicated systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in sec.2 we review the present knowledge on the in - medium condensates . in sec.3",
    "we present the ideas and results of various approaches to calculation of the hadron parameters in medium .",
    "we review briefly the possible saturation mechanisms provided by these models . in sec.4",
    "we consider the first steps to self - consistent calculation of scalar condensate and hadron parameters .",
    "the experience appeared to be very instructive .",
    "say , the analysis led to the conclusion , that in any case the chiral phase transition takes place at the smaller values of density than the pion condensation . hence , the goldstone pions never condense .",
    "however , analysis of the behaviour of the solutions of the corresponding dispersion equation at larger densities appears to be useful .",
    "suggesting qcd sum rules at finite density as a tool for a future complete self - consistent investigation , we show first how the method works .",
    "this is done in sec.5 . in sec.6",
    "we present more detailed self - consistent scenario .",
    "we present the results for symmetric matter , with equal densities of protons and neutrons .    everywhere through the paper",
    "we denote quark field of the flavour @xmath26 and colour @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "we shall omit the colour indices in most of the cases , having in mind averaging over the colours for colourless objects .",
    "as usually , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are spin and isospin pauli matrices and 4 dirac matrices correspondingly . for any four - vector @xmath31",
    "we denote @xmath32 . the system of units with @xmath33 is used .",
    "the quark scalar operator @xmath25 is the only operator , containing minimal number of the field operators @xmath7 , for which the expectation value , in vacuum has a nonzero value .",
    "one can find in the textbooks a remarkable relation , based on partial conservation of axial current ( pcac ) and on the soft - pion theorems @xmath34\\right]|0\\rangle\\ ] ] with @xmath35 standing for the mass and the decay constant of pion , @xmath36 being the density of the hamiltonian of the system , while @xmath37 are the charge operators , corresponding to the axial currents , b is the isospin index .    presenting ( effective ) hamiltonian @xmath38 with @xmath39 conserving ( explicitly breaking ) the chiral symmetry , one finds that only @xmath40 piece contributes to eq.(4 ) . in pure qcd @xmath41 with @xmath42 standing for the current quark masses .",
    "this leads to well known gell - mann  oakes  renner relation ( gmor ) @xcite @xmath43 of course , assuming su(2 ) symmetry , which is true with the high accuracy , one finds @xmath44 .",
    "numerical value @xmath45 can be obtained from eq.([gmor ] ) .",
    "the quark masses can be obtained from the hadron spectroscopy relations and from qcd sum rules  see the review of gasser and leutwyler @xcite .",
    "thus the value of the quark condensate was calculated by using eq.([gmor ] ) .",
    "the data on the lowest order gluon condensate ( @xmath27 is the colour index , @xmath46 is the qcd coupling constant ) @xmath47 was extracted by vainshtein et al .",
    "@xcite from the analysis of leptonic decays of @xmath4 and @xmath48 mesons and from qcd sum - rules analysis of charmonium spectrum @xcite",
    ".      in this approximation the nuclear matter is treated as ideal fermi gas of the nucleons . for the spin - dependent operators @xmath49 the expectation value in the matter @xmath50 , although for the separate polarized nucleons @xmath51 may have a nonzero value .",
    "for the operators @xmath52 which do not depend on spin the deviation of the expectation values @xmath53 from @xmath54 is determined by incoherent sum of the contributions of the nucleons .",
    "thus for any su(2 ) symmetric spin - independent operator @xmath52 @xmath55 with @xmath4 standing for the density of nuclear matter and @xmath56 since @xmath57 does not depend on @xmath58 , eq.([10 ] ) can be presented as @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the volume of the nucleon .",
    "the quark condensates of the same dimension @xmath61 can be built by averaging of the expression @xmath62 with @xmath63 being an arbitrary @xmath64 matrix over the ground state of the matter .",
    "however , any of such matrices can be presented as the linear combination of 5 basic matrices @xmath65 : @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the unit matrix .",
    "one can see , that expectation value @xmath68 vanishes in any uniform system , while those of @xmath69 vanish due to conservation of parity .",
    "the expectation value @xmath70 takes the form @xmath71 in the rest frame of the matter .",
    "it can be presented as @xmath72 with @xmath73 standing for the number of the valence quarks of the flavour @xmath74 in the proton ( neutron ) .",
    "due to conservation of the vector current eq.(14 ) presents exact dependence of this condensate on @xmath4 . for the same reason the linear dependence on @xmath4 is true in more general case of the baryon matter @xmath75    as to the expectation value @xmath76",
    ", it is quite obvious that eq.([9 ] ) is true for the operator @xmath77 if the nucleon density is small enough .",
    "the same refers to the condensates of higher dimension .",
    "the question is : when will the terms nonlinear in @xmath4 become important  ?    before discussing the problem we consider the lowest dimension condensates in the gas approximation .      it has been suggested by weinberg @xcite that the matrix element of the operator @xmath78 in a hadron is proportional to the total number of the quarks and antiquarks of flavour @xmath74 in that hadron .",
    "the quantitative interpretation is , however , not straightforward .",
    "it was noticed by donoghue and nappi @xcite that such identification can not be exact , since the operator @xmath79 is not diagonal and can add quark ",
    "antiquark pair to the hadron .",
    "it was shown by anselmino and forte @xcite that reasonable assumptions on the quark distribution inside the hadron eliminate the non - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "however there are still problems of interpretation of the diagonal matrix elements .",
    "present the quark field of any flavour @xmath80\\ ] ] with @xmath81 and @xmath82 eliminating quarks and creating antiquarks with spin projection @xmath83 , correspondingly .",
    "this leads to @xmath84.\\ ] ]    here @xmath85 and @xmath86 stand for the number of quarks and antiquarks . in the works @xcite",
    "this formula was analysed for the nucleon in framework of quasi - free parton model for the quark dynamics . in this case",
    "the normalization conditions are @xmath87 with @xmath88 standing for the current mass .",
    "the further analysis required further assumptions .    in the nowadays picture of the nucleon its mass @xmath1",
    "is mostly composed of the masses of three valence quarks which are caused by the interactions inside the nucleon . in the orthodox nonrelativistic quark model , in which possible quark  antiquark pairs are ignored , we put @xmath89 and find @xmath90 . in more realistic , relativistic models ,",
    "there is also the contribution of the quark  antiquark pairs . note also that in some approaches , say , in the bag models @xcite or in the soliton model @xcite the motion of the valence quarks is relativistic .",
    "this reduces their contribution to the expectation value @xmath91 by about 30% , since @xmath92 .",
    "the conventional nowadays picture of the nucleon is that it is the system of three valence quarks with the constituent masses @xmath93 and the number of quark  antiquark pairs @xmath94 with @xmath95 , while @xmath96 stands for the number of quark  antiquark pairs with momentum @xmath97 .",
    "thus , the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq.([18 ] ) can be treated as the total number of quarks and antiquarks only under certain assumptions about the dynamics of the constituents of @xmath98 pairs .",
    "they should remain light and their motion should be nonrelativistic , with @xmath99 .",
    "in other models the deviation of the left - hand side ( lhs ) from the number 3 is a characteristic of the role of quark  antiquark pairs in the nucleon .",
    "the value of @xmath91 is related to the observables .",
    "nucleon @xmath100-term , defined by analogy with eq.([4 ] ) @xcite @xmath101\\right]|n\\rangle\\ ] ] provides by using eq.([6 ] ) @xmath102 with @xmath103 on the other hand , @xcite the @xmath100-term is connected to the pion  nucleon elastic scattering amplitude @xmath104 .",
    "denote @xmath105 as momenta of the nucleon and pion before ( after ) scattering . introducing the mandelstam variables @xmath106 ,",
    "@xmath107 we find the amplitude @xmath108 in the unphysical point to be @xmath109    the experiments provide the data on the physical amplitude @xmath110 leading to @xcite @xmath111 the method of extrapolation of observable on - mass shell - amplitude to the unphysical point was developed by gasser et al .",
    "they found @xmath112 note that from the point of chiral expansion , the difference @xmath113 is of higher order , i.e. @xmath114 .    the value @xmath115 mev corresponds to @xmath116 .",
    "this is the strong support of the presence of @xmath98 pairs inside the nucleon .",
    "however direct identification of the value @xmath117 with the total number of quarks and antiquarks is possible only under the assumptions , described above .",
    "the formula for the scalar condensate in the gas approximation @xmath118 or @xmath119 was obtained by drukarev and levin @xcite .",
    "of course , one can just substitute the semi - experimental value of @xmath100 , given by eq.([25 ] ) .",
    "however for the further discussion it is instructive to give a brief review of the calculations of the sigma - term .",
    "most of the early calculations of @xmath100-term were carried out in the framework of njl model  see eq.(1 ) .",
    "the results were reviewed by vogl and weise @xcite . in this approach",
    "the quarks with initially very small `` current '' masses @xmath120mev , @xmath121mev obtain relatively large `` constituent '' masses @xmath122mev by four - fermion interaction ,  eq.(1 ) .",
    "if the nucleon is treated as the weakly bound system of three constituent quarks , the @xmath100-term can be calculated as the sum of those of three constituent quarks .",
    "the early calculations provided the value of @xmath123mev , being somewhat smaller , than the one , determined by eq.([25 ] ) .",
    "the latter can be reproduced by assuming rather large content of strange quarks in the nucleon @xcite or by inclusion of possible coupling of the quarks to diquarks @xcite .",
    "in effective lagrangian approach the hamiltonian of the system is presented by eq.([5 ] ) with @xmath40 determined by eq.([6 ] ) while @xmath124 is written in terms of nucleon ( or constituent quarks ) and meson degrees of freedom .",
    "it was found by gasser @xcite that @xmath125 with @xmath126 the derivation of eq.([28 ] ) is based in feynman ",
    "hellmann theorem @xcite .",
    "the nontrivial point of eq.([28 ] ) is that the derivatives of the state vectors in the equation @xmath127 cancel .    recently",
    "becher and leutwyler @xcite reviewed investigations , based on pion  nucleon nonlinear lagrangian . in this approach",
    "the contribution of @xmath98 pairs is @xmath128 with the last factor in rhs @xmath129 as follows from eq.([gmor ] ) .",
    "the calculations in this approach reproduce the value @xmath130mev .    similar calculations @xcite were carried out in framework of perturbative chiral quark model of gutsche and robson @xcite which is based on the effective chiral lagrangian describing quarks as relativistic fermions moving in effective self - consistent field .",
    "the @xmath98 pairs are contained in pions .",
    "the value of the @xmath100-term obtained in this model is also @xmath130mev .",
    "the skyrme - type models provide somewhat larger values @xmath131mev @xcite and @xmath132mev @xcite .",
    "the chiral soliton model calculation gave @xmath133mev @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in other approaches are more controversial .",
    "two latest lattice qcd calculations gave @xmath134mev @xcite and @xmath135mev @xcite .",
    "the attempts to extract the value of @xmath100-term directly from qcd sum rules underestimate it , providing @xmath136mev @xcite and @xmath137mev @xcite .",
    "we shall analyse the scalar condensate beyond the gas approximation expressed by eq.([26 ] ) , in subsection 2.7 .",
    "following subsec.2.2 we write in the gas approximation @xmath138 with notation @xmath139 .",
    "fortunately , the expectation value @xmath140 can be calculated .",
    "this was done @xcite by averaging of the trace of qcd energy - momentum tensor , including the anomaly , over the nucleon state .",
    "the trace is @xmath141 with @xmath142 , while @xmath143 stands for the total number of flavours .",
    "however , @xmath144 does not depend on @xmath143 due to remarkable cancellation obtained by shifman et  al .",
    "@xcite @xmath145 here @xmath146 denotes `` heavy '' quarks , i.e. the quarks , whose masses @xmath147 are much larger than the inverse confinement radius @xmath148 .",
    "the accuracy of eq.(35 ) is @xmath149 .",
    "thus we only have to consider the light flavors @xmath150 to give a reasonable approximation since @xmath151gev@xmath152 .",
    "this leads to @xmath153 with @xmath26 standing for @xmath154 and @xmath83 .",
    "since on the other hand @xmath155 one comes to @xmath156    for the condensate @xmath157 drukarev and levin @xcite obtained in the gas approximation @xmath158 in the chiral limit @xmath159 and @xmath160    the expectation value @xmath161 is not known definitely .",
    "donoghue and nappi @xcite obtained @xmath162 @xmath163 assuming , that the hyperon mass splitting in su(3 ) octet , is described by the lowest order perturbation theory in @xmath164 .",
    "approximately the same result @xmath165 was obtained in various versions of chiral perturbation theory with nonlinear lagrangians @xcite .",
    "the lattice calculations provide larger values , e.g. @xmath166 @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the skyrme model @xcite and perturbative chiral quark model @xcite lead to smaller values , @xmath167 . since @xmath168 it is reasonable to treat the second term in the brackets of rhs of eq.([39a ] ) as a small correction .",
    "thus we can put @xmath169 which is exact in chiral su(3 ) limit in gas approximation .",
    "one can estimate the magnitude of nonlinear contributions to the condensate @xmath170 .",
    "averaging @xmath171 over the ground state of the matter one finds @xmath172 with @xmath173 standing for the binding energy of the nucleon in medium , while @xmath174 denotes nonlinear part of the condensate @xmath175 .",
    "one can expect the last factor to be small ( otherwise we should accept that strange meson exchange plays large role in @xmath176 interaction ) .",
    "hence we can assume @xmath177 with nonlinear terms caused by the binding energy @xmath173 .",
    "thus , at least at the densities close to saturation value , corrections to the gas approximation are small . at @xmath178 the value of the condensate @xmath170 differs from the vacuum value by about 6% .",
    "the condensates of higher dimension come from averaging of the products of larger number of operators of quark and ( or ) gluon fields .",
    "such condensates appear also from the expansion of bilocal operators of lower dimension .",
    "say , the simplest bilocal condensate @xmath179 is gauge - dependent ( recall that the quarks interact with the vacuum gluon fields ) . to obtain the gauge - invariant expression",
    "one can substitute @xmath180 with @xmath181 being the covariant derivatives , which replaced the usual partial derivatives @xmath182 @xcite . due to the lorentz invariance the expectation value @xmath183 depends on @xmath184 only .",
    "hence , only the terms with even powers of @xmath58 survive , providing in the chiral limit @xmath185 @xmath186 where @xmath187 are gell - mann su(3 ) basic matrices . the second term in right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq.([44 ] )",
    "can be obtained by noticing that @xmath188 and by applying the qcd equation of motion in the form @xmath189 the condensate @xmath190 is usually presented `` in units '' of @xmath191 , i.e. @xmath192 with @xmath193 having the dimension of the mass .",
    "the qcd sum rules analysis of belyaev and ioffe @xcite gives @xmath194 for @xmath195 and @xmath196 quarks .",
    "however instanton liquid model estimation made by shuryak @xcite provides about three times larger value .",
    "the situation with expectation values averaged over the nucleon is more complicated .",
    "there is infinite number of condensates of each dimension .",
    "this happens because the nonlocal condensates depend on two variables @xmath184 and @xmath197 with @xmath198 being the four - dimensional momentum of the nucleon .",
    "thus , even the lowest order term of expansion in powers of @xmath184 @xmath199 contains infinite number of condensates .",
    "say , @xmath200 with @xmath201 defined by expansion , presented by eq.([43 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath202 is the number of the valence quarks of the fixed flavour in the nucleon . presenting @xmath203 we find the function @xmath204 to be the asymptotics of the nucleon structure function @xcite and the expansion of @xmath205 in powers of @xmath197 is expressed through expansion in the moments of the structure function .",
    "the next to leading order of the expansion of @xmath206 in powers of @xmath184 leads to the condensate @xmath207 and @xmath208 the qcd sum rules analysis of braun and kolesnichenko @xcite gave the value @xmath209 .",
    "using qcd equations of motion we obtain relations between the moments of the functions @xmath210 and @xmath211 . denoting @xmath212 for any function @xmath213 we find , following drukarev and ryskin @xcite @xmath214    situation with the nonlocal scalar condensate is somewhat simpler , since all the matrix elements of the odd order derivatives are proportional to the current masses of the quarks .",
    "this can be shown by presenting @xmath215 followed by using the qcd equations of motion .",
    "hence , in the chiral limit such condensates vanish for @xmath195 and @xmath196 quarks .",
    "the condensate containing one derivative can be expressed through the vector condensate and thus can be obtained beyond the gas approximation @xmath216 in the chiral limit @xmath159 this condensate vanishes for @xmath195 and @xmath196 quarks .",
    "the even order derivatives contain the matrix elements corresponding to expansion in powers of @xmath184 which do not contain masses . in the lowest order",
    "there is the expectation value @xmath217  compare eq.([46 ] ) .",
    "it was estimated by jin et  al .",
    "@xcite in framework of the bag model @xmath218 together with another condensate of the mass dimension 5 @xmath219    considering the four - quark condensates , we limit ourselves to those with colourless diquarks with fixed flavours .",
    "the general formula for such expectation values is @xmath220 with @xmath221 matrices @xmath222 are introduced in eq.([12 ] ) . for two lightest flavours",
    "there are thus @xmath223 condensates . due to su(2 ) symmetry @xmath224 . due to parity conservation only the diagonal condensates @xmath225 and also @xmath226 and @xmath227 have nonzero value in uniform matter . since the matter is the eigenstate of the operator @xmath228 , we immediately find @xmath229 with @xmath230 standing for the density of the quarks of i - th flavour . in the case ,",

    "this makes the problem of exact vacuum expectation value to be very important .",
    "indeed , one of the usual assumptions is that @xcite @xmath236 this means that we assume the vacuum state @xmath237 to give the leading contribution to the sum @xmath238 over the complete set of the states @xmath239 with the quantum numbers of vacuum .",
    "novikov et  al .",
    "@xcite showed , that eq.([58 ] ) becomes exact in the limit of large number of colours @xmath240 .",
    "however , the contribution of excited states , e.g. of the @xmath100-meson @xmath241 can increase the rhs of eq.(59 ) . assuming the nucleon radius to be of the order of 1  fm we find the second and the third terms of the rhs of eq.([57 ] ) to be of the comparable magnitude .",
    "this becomes increasingly important in view of the only calculation of the 4-quarks condensate in the nucleon , carried out by celenza et  al .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",

    "note , however , that the results which predict the fast drop of @xmath21 have , at best , a limited region of validity .",

    "this means that the contribution of the lowest lying hadron was treated explicitly , while all the other excitations were approximated by continuum . in order to emphasise the contribution of the pole inverse laplace ( borel )",
    "transform was applied to both sides of eq.([91 ] ) in the papers mentioned above .",

    "the idea was to express the change of nucleon characteristics through the in - medium change of the values of qcd condensates .",

    "here we review briefly the main ideas of the method .",
    "there are several detailed reviews on the subject  see , e.g. , @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the points , which will be needed for the application of the approach to the case of nuclear matter .",
    "the main idea is to establish a correspondence between descriptions of the function @xmath9 , introduced in subsec.3.6 in terms of hadronic and quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "( recall that @xmath9 describes the propagation of the system with the quantum numbers of the nucleon ) .",
    "the method is based on the fundamental feature of qcd , known as the asymptotic freedom .",
    "this means , that at @xmath354 the function @xmath351 can be presented as the power series of @xmath361 and qcd coupling @xmath46 .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion are the expectation values of local operators constructed of quark and gluon fields , which are called `` condensates '' .",
    "thus such presentation , known as operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite , provides the perturbative expansion of short - distance effects , while all the nonperturbative physics is contained in the condensates .",
    "the correspondence between the hadron and quark - gluon descriptions is based on eq.([91 ] ) .",
    "the empirical data are used for the spectral function im@xmath356 in the rhs of eq.([91 ] ) .",
    "namely , we know , that the lowest lying state is the bound state of three quarks , which manifests itself as a pole in the ( unknown ) point @xmath549 . assuming , that the next singularity is the branching point @xmath550 , one can write exact presentation @xmath551 with @xmath552 being the residue at the pole . substituting rhs of eq.([136 ] ) into eq.([91 ] ) and employing @xmath361 power expansion in lhs , i.e. putting @xmath553 one finds certain connections between quark - gluon and hadron presentations @xmath554 of course , the detailed structure of the spectral density @xmath555 can not be resolved in such approach .",
    "the further approximations can be prompted by asymptotic behaviour @xmath556 at @xmath557 with @xmath343 denoting the discontinuity .",
    "the discontinuity is caused by the logarithmic contributions of the perturbative ope terms .",
    "the usual ansatz consist in extrapolation of eq.([139 ] ) to the lower values of @xmath319 , replacing also the physical threshold @xmath558 by the unknown effective threshold @xmath559 , i.e. @xmath560 and thus @xmath561 the lhs of eq.([141 ] ) contains qcd condensates .",
    "the rhs of eq.([141 ] ) contains three unknown parameters : @xmath562 and @xmath559 . of course , eq.([141 ] ) makes sense only if the first term of the rhs , treated exactly is larger than the second term , treated approximately .",
    "the approximation @xmath563 becomes increasingly true while the value @xmath564 increases . on the contrary , the `` pole+continuum '' model in the rhs of eq.([141 ] ) becomes more accurate while @xmath564 decreases .",
    "the analytical dependence of the lhs and rhs of eq.([141 ] ) on @xmath565 is quite different .",
    "the important assumption is that they are close in certain intermediate region of the values of @xmath565 , being close also to the true function @xmath351 .    to improve the overlap of the qcd and phenomenological descriptions ,",
    "one usually applies the borel transform , defined as @xmath566 with @xmath567 called the borel mass .",
    "there are several useful features of the borel transform .    1 .",
    "it removes the divergent terms in the lhs of eqs .",
    "( [ 138 ] ) and ( [ 141 ] ) which are caused by the free quark loops .",
    "this happens , since the borel transform eliminates all the polynomials in @xmath565 .",

    "if both rhs and lhs of eq.([141 ] ) were calculated exactly , the relation would be independent on @xmath571 .",
    "however , certain approximations are made in both sides .",
    "the basic assumption is that there exists a range of @xmath571 for which the two sides have a good overlap , approximating also the true function @xmath572 .",

    "similar exchange with the valence quarks is determined by the vector condensate @xmath362 and is described by the first term of rhs of eq.([188 ] ) .",
    "the second term describes additional interaction which takes place during such exchange .",
    "these exchanges cause the shift of the position of the pole @xmath721 . while the interactions of the nucleons depend on the condensates @xmath747 and @xmath362",
    ", these condensates emerge due to the presence of the nucleons .",
    "also , the nonlinear part of @xmath748 is determined by @xmath0 interactions .",
    "thus , there is certain analogy between qcd sum rules picture and njl mechanism .",
    "as we have seen , the qcd sum rules can be viewed as connection between exchange by uncorrelated @xmath98 pairs and exchange by strongly correlated pairs with the same quantum numbers ( mesons ) .",
    "this results in connection between the lorentz structures of correlators and in - medium nucleon propagators . in the leading terms of ope the vector ( scalar ) structure",
    "is determined by vector ( scalar ) condensate .",
    "the large values ( of about 250300 mev ) of the first and the fourth terms in rhs of eq.([188 ] ) provide thus the direct analogy with qhd picture .",
    "note , however , that the sum rules , presented by eqs .",
    "( [ 177])([179 ] ) contain also the terms , which are unusual for qhd approach .",
    "indeed , the term @xmath233 in eq.([177 ] ) enters the vector structure of the correlator ( and thus , of the propagator of the nucleon ) corresponding , however , to exchange by the vacuum quantum numbers with the matter . on the other hand , the last term of rhs of eq.([179 ] )",
    "treated in the gas approximation , corresponds to exchange by the quantum numbers of vector mesons .",
    "however , it appears in the scalar structure .",
    "this term originated from the four - quark condensate @xmath698 . while the exact value of the condensate @xmath233 is still obscure , the condensate @xmath698 is easily calculated .",
    "this ope term is shown in fig . 13 .",
    "it provides a noticeable contribution .",
    "such terms do not emerge in the mean - filed approximation of qhd .",

    "another approach , developed by maryland group , was reviewed by cohen et  al .",
    "@xcite . in most of the papers ( except @xcite )",
    "the lehmann representation was a departure point .",
    "in framework of this approach the authors investigated the lorentz structure of qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "they analysed detaily the dependence of the self - energies on the in - medium value of the scalar four - quark condensate @xcite .",

    "it is not clear , if in this case the singularities , connected with the probe proton are separated from those of the matter itself .",
    "the fixed value of three - dimensional momenta is a proper characteristics for in - medium nucleon .",
    "that is why this was the choice of variables in lehmann dispersion relation with the fermi energy as a typical scale .",

    "the nuclei consisting of equal numbers of protons and neutrons with one more proton or neutron added are known as the mirror nuclei .",
    "if the charge symmetry ( known also as isospin symmetry ) of strong interactions is assumed , the binding energy difference of mirror nuclei is determined by electromagnetic interactions only , the main contribution being caused by the interaction of the odd nucleon . nolen and",
    "schiffer @xcite found the discrepancy between the experimental data and theoretical results on the electromagnetic contribution to the energy difference .",
    "this discrepancy appeared to be a growing function of atomic number @xmath52 .",
    "it reaches the value of about 0.5  mev at @xmath752 .",
    "later the effect became known as nolen  schiffer anomaly ( nsa ) .",
    "the nsa stimulated more detailed analysis of electromagnetic interactions in such systems .",
    "auerbach et  al .",
    "@xcite studied the influence of coulomb forces on core polarization .",
    "however , this did not explain the nsa .",
    "bulgac and shaginyan @xcite attributed the whole nsa phenomena to the influence of the nuclear surface on the electromagnetic interactions .",
    "thus they predict nsa to vanish in infinite medium .",
    "however most of the publications on the subject contain the attempts to explain nsa by the charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) by the strong interactions at the hadronic level .",

    "this explains the large part of nsa , but not the whole effect .    on the quark level",
    "the csb effects in the strong interactions are due to the nonzero value of the difference of the quark masses @xmath754 several quark models have been used for investigation of nsa by calculation of neutron  proton mass difference in nuclear matter ( recall that in vacuum @xmath755mev , while the coulomb energy difference is 0.5  mev .",
    "hence , the shift caused by strong interactions is @xmath756mev ) .",

    "were made in several papers @xcite@xcite .",
    "we shall follow the papers of drukarev and ryskin @xcite which present the direct extension of the approach , discussed above .",
    "it is based on eqs .",
    "( [ 182])([184 ] ) with the terms @xmath762 being calculated with the account of the finite values of the current quark masses . besides the quark mass difference the csb effects manifest themselves through isospin breaking condensates @xmath763    the characteristics @xmath764 and @xmath765 are not independent degrees of freedom .",
    "they turn to zero , at @xmath766 , being certain ( unknown ) functions of @xmath148 . the dependence @xmath767",
    ", @xmath768 can be obtained in framework of the specific models .",
    "anyway , due to the small values of @xmath42 we expect @xmath769 , @xmath770 . following the strategy and keeping only the leading terms , which are linear in @xmath148 , we shall obtain the energy shift in the form @xmath771 with @xmath772 being the functions of the density @xmath4 ( the contribution @xmath773 is included into @xmath774 ) .    to calculate the mass - dependent terms in lhs of eqs .",
    "( [ 182])([184 ] ) one should include the quark masses to the in - medium quark propagator  eq.([149 ] ) .",
    "the first term in rhs of eq.([149 ] ) , which is just the free quark propagator should be modified into @xmath775 .",
    "this provides the contribution to the scalar structure of the correlator in the lowest order of ope .",
    "account of the finite quark masses in the second term of eq.([149 ] ) manifest themselves in the next to leading orders of ope .",
    "say , during evaluation of the second term in subsection 5.2 , we used the relations expressed by eq.([51 ] ) , which were obtained for the massless quarks .",
    "now the first of them takes the form @xmath776 for the flavour @xmath777 .",
    "this leads to the contribution to the vector structure of the correlator proportional to the scalar condensate .",
    "also , the second moment of the scalar distribution is proportional to the vector condensate , contributing to the scalar structure of the correlator .",
    "the leading contribution caused by the scalar structure of the correlator @xmath778 while the csb term , originated by the vector structure is @xmath779 with @xmath780 being the value of saturation density .",
    "the term @xmath781 of eq.([186 ] ) provides the contribution containing the csb condensate @xmath765  eq.([194 ] ) @xmath782    for the complete calculation one needs the isospin breaking shifts of vacuum parameters @xmath783 and @xmath784 while the empirical value of @xmath785 can be used .",
    "thus , the analysis of csb effects in vacuum should be carried out in framework of the method as well .",
    "this was done by adami et  al . @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath783 , @xmath784 and of the vacuum isospin breaking value @xmath764 were obtained through the quark mass difference and the empirical values of the shifts of the baryon masses .",
    "this prompts another form of eq.([195 ] ) @xmath786 with @xmath787 , @xmath788 .",
    "the expressions for the contributions to @xmath789 , caused by the shifts of the vacuum values @xmath785 , @xmath783 and @xmath784 are rather complicated . at @xmath537",
    "the corresponding contribution is @xmath790    for the sum @xmath791 we find , after adding the contribution @xmath773 @xmath792    the numerical results can be obtained if the value of @xmath765 is calculated .",
    "this can be done in framework of certain models . however , even now we can make some conclusions . if we expect the increasing restoration of the isospin symmetry with growing density , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath793 . also , all the model calculations provide @xmath794 .",
    "thus we expect @xmath795 . if @xmath796 we find @xmath797mev , eliminating the vacuum value @xmath756mev .",
    "hence , the isospin invariance appears to be restored for both the condensates and nucleon masses .",
    "the present analysis enables also to clarify the role of the csb effects in the scalar channel .",
    "indeed , neglecting these effects , i.e. putting @xmath798 we obtain @xmath799 .",
    "this contradicts both experimental values and general theoretical expectations .",
    "thus we came to the importance of csb effects in the scalar channel .",
    "adami and brown @xcite used njl model , combined with br1 scaling for calculation of parameter @xmath765 .",
    "they found @xmath800 . substituting this value into eq.([200 ] ) we find @xmath801 with the errors caused mostly by uncertainties of the value of @xmath764 .",
    "a more rapid decrease of the ratio @xmath802 would lead to larger values @xmath803 with @xmath804 .",
    "putting @xmath805 provides @xmath806mev .    of course , eq.([203 ] ) is obtained for infinite nuclear matter and it is not clear , if it can be extrapolated for the case @xmath752 .",
    "we can state that at least qualitative explanation of the nsa is achieved .",
    "as we have stated earlier , the qcd sum rules can be viewed as a connection between exchange of uncorrelated @xmath98 pairs between our probe nucleon and the matter and the exchange by strongly correlated pairs with the same quantum numbers ( the mesons ) . in the conventional qhd picture",
    "this means that in the dirac equation for the nucleon in the nuclear matter @xmath807 the vector interaction @xmath333 corresponds to exchange by the vector mesons with the matter while the scalar interaction @xmath296 is caused by the scalar mesons exchange . in the mean field approximation the vector interaction @xmath333",
    "is proportional to density @xmath4 , while the scalar interaction is proportional to the `` scalar density '' @xmath808 which is a more complicated function of density @xmath4  see eqs .",
    "( [ 74]),([76 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath809 , while @xmath810 .",
    "we have seen that qcd sum rules provide similar picture in the lowest orders of ope : vector and scalar parts of the correlator @xmath360 depend on vector and scalar condensates correspondingly : @xmath811 ; @xmath812 .",
    "however as we have seen in subsection 5.2.6 , we find a somewhat more complicated dependence in the higher order ope terms , say , @xmath813 , depending on both scalar and vector condensates .",
    "this means that the corresponding scalar interaction @xmath814 , requiring analysis beyond the mean field approximation .    as one can see from eqs .",
    "( [ 197 ] ) and ( [ 198 ] ) in the case of csb interactions such complications emerge in the sum rules approach in the leading orders of ope .",
    "thus the qcd sum rules motivated csb nuclear forces @xmath333 and @xmath296 in eq.([204 ] ) are expected to contain dependence on both `` vector '' and `` scalar '' densities , i.e. @xmath815 and @xmath816 .",
    "as we said above , such potentials can emerge due to complicated structure of nucleon  meson vertices .",
    "this can provide the guide - lines for building up the csb nucleon ",
    "nucleon potentials .",
    "another new point is the importance of the csb in the scalar channel . neglecting the scalar channel csb interactions we obtain the wrong sign of the effects , i.e. @xmath799 .",
    "this contradicts the earlier belief that the vector channel @xmath817 mixing is the main mechanism of the effect @xcite .",
    "our result is supported by the analysis of hatsuda et  al .",
    "@xcite who found that the @xmath817 mixing changes sign for the off - shell mesons . this can also help in constructing the csb nuclear forces .",
    "the experiments carried out by emc collaboration @xcite demonstrated that deep inelastic scattering function @xmath818 of nucleus with atomic number @xmath52 ( @xmath819 stands for bjorken variable ) differs from the sum of those of free nucleons .",
    "most of the data were obtained for iron ( fe ) .",
    "the structure function was compared to that of deuteron , which imitates the system of free nucleons .",
    "the deviation of the ratio @xmath820 from unity is caused by deviation of a nucleus from the system of free nucleons .",
    "the ratio @xmath821 appeared to be the function of @xmath819 indeed .",
    "exceeding unity at @xmath822 it drops at larger @xmath819 reaching the minimum value @xmath823 at @xmath824 .",
    "this behaviour of the ratio was called the emc effect .",
    "there are several mechanisms which may cause the deviation of the ratio @xmath821 from unity .",
    "these are the contribution of quark  antiquark pairs , hidden in pions , originated by the nucleon ",
    "nucleon interactions , possible formation of multiquark clusters inside the nucleus , etc . here",
    "we shall try to find how the difference of the quark distributions inside the in - medium and free nucleons changes the ratio @xmath821 .",
    "the qcd sum rules method was applied to investigation of the proton deep inelastic structure functions in vacuum in several papers .",
    "the second moments of the structure functions were obtained by kolesnichenko @xcite and by belyaev and block @xcite . the structure function @xmath825 at moderate values of @xmath819",
    "was calculated by belyaev and ioffe @xcite . here",
    "we shall rely on the approach , developed by braun et  al .",
    "@xcite which can be generalized for the case of finite densities in a natural way . on the other hand ,",
    "such generalization is the extension of the approach discussed in this section .    to obtain the structure function of the proton , the authors of @xcite considered the correlation function @xmath9 , describing the system with",
    "the quantum numbers of proton , interacting twice with a strongly virtual hard photon @xmath826h(y,\\delta)|0\\rangle\\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath573 and @xmath827 are the momenta carried by the correlator in initial and final states , @xmath828 is the momentum transferred by the photon scattering .",
    "the incoming ( outgoing ) photon carries momentum @xmath829 , interacting with the correlator in the point @xmath830 @xmath831 .",
    "the quark ",
    "photon interaction is presented by the function @xmath832 . in the next step the double dispersion relation in variables @xmath833 and @xmath834 is considered .",
    "the crucial point is the operator expansion in terms of the nonlocal operators depending on the light - like @xmath835 vector @xmath343 @xcite .",
    "after the borel transform in both @xmath836 and @xmath837 is carried out and the equal borel masses @xmath838 are considered , the fourier transform in @xmath343 provides the momentum distribution of the quarks .",
    "this approach was applied by drukarev and ryskin @xcite for calculation of the quark distributions in the proton , placed into the nuclear matter .",
    "the two types of contributions to the correlator should be considered  fig.14a , b . in the diagram of fig.14a",
    "the photon interacts with the quark of the free loop . in the diagram of fig.14b it interacts with the quark exchanging with the matter .",
    "the modification of the distributions of the quarks was expressed through the vector condensate , which vanishes in vacuum and through the in - medium shifts of the other condensates and of the nucleon parameters @xmath839 and @xmath559 .",
    "the result appeared to be less sensitive to the value of the four - quark condensate than the characteristics of the nucleon considered in subsection 5.2 .",
    "note that the results are true for the moderate values of @xmath58 only and can not be extended to the region @xmath840 .",
    "this is because the ope diverges at small @xmath58 @xcite .    omitting the details of calculation , provided in @xcite we present the results in fig.15 .",
    "one can see that the distributions of @xmath195 and @xmath196 quarks in fraction of the target momentum @xmath58 are modified in a different way and there is no common scale . the fraction of the momentum carried by the @xmath195 quarks @xmath841 decreases by about 4% .",
    "the ratio @xmath842 , determined by eq.([206 ] ) has a typical emc shape .",
    "the technique used in @xcite can be expanded for the calculation of the quark distributions at @xmath843 .",
    "thus the approach enables to describe the cumulative aspects of the problem as well .      in spite of the relative success , described above",
    ", the approach faces a number of difficulties . some of them take place in vacuum as well .",
    "the other ones emerge in the case of the finite density .",
    "the first problem is the convergence of ope in the lhs of the sum rules .",
    "fortunately , the condensates which contribute to the lowest order ope terms can be either calculated in a model - independent way , or expressed through the observables .",
    "this is true for both vacuum and nuclear matter  at least , for the values of density which are close to the saturation values @xmath3 .",
    "however the situation is not so simple for the higher order ope contributions .",
    "the four - quark condensate is the well known headache of all the qcd sum rules practitioners .",
    "the problem becomes more complicated at finite density , since the conventional form of presentation of this condensate contains the strongly cancelling contributions .    in order to include the higher ope terms one needs the additional model assumptions .",
    "the same is true for the attempts to go beyond the gas approximation at finite densities .",
    "recently kisslinger @xcite suggested a hybrid of qcd sum rules and of the cloudy bag model .",
    "note , however that qcd sum rules is not a universal tool and there are the cases when ope does not converge .",
    "we mentioned earlier that this takes place for the nucleon structure functions at small @xmath58  @xcite . some time ago",
    "eletsky and ioffe @xcite adduced the case when the short distance physics plays important role , making the ope convergence assumption less convincing .",
    "recently dutt - mazumder et al .",
    "@xcite faced the situation when the ratio of two successive terms of @xmath361 expansion is not quenched .",
    "there are also problems with the rhs of the sum rules .",
    "the `` pole+continuum '' model is a very simple ansatz , and it may appear to be oversimplified even in vacuum .",
    "the spectrum of the nucleon correlator in - medium is much more complicated than in vacuum .",
    "the problem is to separate the singularities of the correlator , connected with the nucleon from those of the medium itself .",
    "as we have seen , the `` pole+continuum '' model can be justified to the same extent as in vacuum until we do not include the three - nucleon interactions .",
    "we do not have a simple and convincing model of the spectrum which would include such interactions .",
    "anyway , the success of vacuum sum rules @xcite and reasonable results for the nucleons at finite densities described in this section prompt that the further development of the approach is worth while .",
    "the shape of the density dependence of the quark scalar condensate in the baryon matter @xmath272 appears to be very important for hadronic physics .",
    "it is the characteristics of the matter as a whole , describing the degree of restoration of the chiral symmetry with growing density . on the other hand , the dependence @xmath272 is believed to determine the change of the nucleon effective mass @xmath19 .",
    "the shape of the dependence @xmath844 differs in the different models .",
    "the lowest order density dependence term in the expansion of the function @xmath272 is model - independent .",
    "however for the rigorous calculation of the higher order terms one needs to know the density dependence of the hadron parameters @xmath19 , @xmath539 , @xmath21 , etc . in sec.4 we presented the results of the calculations of the condensate @xmath272 under certain model assumptions .",
    "a more detailed analysis requires the investigation of the dependence of these parameters on qcd condensates .",
    "such dependence can be obtained by using the approach , based on the in - medium qcd sum rules . in sec.5",
    "we show how in - medium qcd sum rules for the nucleons work . even in a somewhat skeptical review of leinweber @xcite , where the present state of art of applications of the qcd sum rules is criticised , the method is referred to as `` the best fundamentally based approach for investigations of hadrons in nuclear matter '' . of course , to proceed further one must try to overcome the difficulties , discussed in subsec.5.5",
    ".    the lowest order condensates can be either calculated , or connected directly to the observables .",
    "this is true for both vacuum and nuclear mater .",
    "however , neither in vacuum nor in medium the higher order condensates can be obtained without applications of certain models .",
    "thus in further steps we shall need a composition of qcd sum rules with model assumptions .",
    "we have seen that the density dependence of the delta isobar effective mass is important for the calculation of the nonlinear contribution to the scalar condensate @xmath272 .",
    "the shape of this dependence is still obscure .",
    "thus the extension of the qcd sum rules method for the description of @xmath343-isobars in - medium dynamics is needed .",
    "such work is going on  see , e.g. , the paper of johnson and kisslinger @xcite .    the fundamental in - medium",
    "goldberger - treiman and gell - mann  oakes  renner relations are expected to be the other milestones of the approach .",
    "the agreement with the results with those of conventional nuclear physics at @xmath845 would be the test of the approach .",
    "further development of the approach would require inclusion of the vector mesons .",
