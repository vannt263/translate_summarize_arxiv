    "wave - particle duality , a manifestation of the complementarity principle , proposes many questions about the behavior of particles in interferometers .",
    "it has long been known that which - path information and visibility of interference fringes are complementary quantities : any distinguishability between the paths of an interferometer destroys the quality ( visibility ) of the interference fringes .",
    "the incompatibility between which - path information and interference effects has been quantified through inequalities by various authors @xcite .",
    "originally , it was thought that the uncertainty principle was the mechanism responsible for the absence of interference fringes due to a which - path measurement .",
    "the first and perhaps most famous example of this idea is the einstein - bohr dialogue at the fifth solvay conference in brussels concerning einstein s recoiling double - slit gedanken experiment , in which the momentum transfer from incident particles to the double - slit is measured to determine the particles trajectories@xcite .",
    "however , bohr showed that the uncertainty in the knowledge of the double - slit s initial position was of the same order of magnitude as the space between the interference minima and maxima : interference fringes were  washed out \" due to the uncertainty principle@xcite .",
    "more recently , scully and drhl have shown that , in certain cases , we can attribute this loss of interference not to the uncertainty principle but to quantum entanglement between the interfering particles and the measuring apparatus@xcite .",
    "for example , disregarding internal degrees of freedom , we can represent the state of particles exiting an interferometer by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the possibility for the particles to take path @xmath3 or @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the probability distribution for one particle detection at a point @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 ; the cross terms @xmath7 and @xmath8 are responsible for interference .",
    "the introduction of an apparatus @xmath9 capable of marking the path taken by a particle without disturbing @xmath1 or @xmath2 can be represented by the expansion of the hilbert space of the system in the following way : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the state of the which - path marker corresponding to the possibility of passage through the path @xmath12 .",
    "the which - path marker has become entangled with the two possible particle states .",
    "a @xmath13% effective which - path marker is prepared such that @xmath14 is orthogonal to @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", a measurement of @xmath9 reduces @xmath16 to the appropriate state for the passage of the particle through path @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "however , the disappearance of the interference pattern is not dependent on such a measurement .",
    "the which - path marker s presence alone is sufficient to make the two terms on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : int2 ] ) orthogonal and thus there will be no cross terms in @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , it is enough that the which - path information is available to destroy interference .",
    "moreover , provided that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not significantly perturbed by the observer , one can _",
    "erase _ the which - path information and recover interference by correlating the particle detection with an appropriate measurement on the which - path markers .",
    "such a measurement is known as _ quantum erasure_. in addition , if the which - path marker is capable of storing information , the erasure can be performed even after the detection of the particle .",
    "the possibility of delayed erasure generated a discussion in respect to it s legitimacy , with the argument that it would be possible , in this way , to alter the past @xcite .",
    "this argument is founded on an erroneous interpretation of the formalism of quantum mechanics @xcite . in recent years",
    ", there have been a number of ideas and experiments ( performed and proposed ) in which which - path information is accessible without causing severe perturbations to the interfering particles . among the proposals ,",
    "we distinguish the ones due to scully and drhl @xcite and to scully , englert and walther @xcite due to their originality and pedagogical content .    due to their momentum , time and polarization correlation properties , photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion play an important role in the experimental demonstrations of quantum erasure @xcite .",
    "although the quantum erasure phenomenon is present in all reported experiments , only one @xcite can be considered an optical analog of the original proposal of scully and drhl @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report a quantum eraser experiment which actually uses a young double - slit to create interference .",
    "the experiment is analyzed in connection with the proposal of scully , englert and walther ( sew ) @xcite .",
    "to the authors knowledge , this is the first demonstration of a quantum eraser in which interference is obtained from the passage of the particles through a real double - slit .    in section",
    "ii we give a brief summary of the sew quantum eraser . the theory behind our quantum eraser is presented in section iii . the experimental setup and results",
    "are presented in sections iv and v , respectively .",
    "the experiment reported here is inspired by the proposal of scully , englert and walther @xcite , which can be summarized as follows : a beam of rydberg atoms in an excited state is incident on a double - slit small enough to form a young interference pattern on a distant screen . in front of each slit",
    "is placed a which - path marker , which consists of a micromaser cavity of appropriate length such that the emission probability for an atom traversing the cavity is @xmath3 .",
    "then , the presence of a photon in either cavity marks the passage of an atom through the corresponding slit and thus destroys the interference pattern , because which - path information is now available .",
    "the perturbation to the spatial part of the wave function of the atoms due to the cavities is ignorable @xcite .",
    "a measurement that projects the state of the cavities onto a symmetric ( antisymmetric ) combination of @xmath17 ( no photon present ) and @xmath18 ( one photon present ) performs the erasure , and an interference pattern is recovered in correlated detection .",
    "consider the following experimental setup : a linearly polarized beam of photons is incident on a double - slit .",
    "if the double slit is of appropriate dimensions , the probability distribution for a one - photon detection at a distant screen is given by a young interference pattern .",
    "suppose that in front of each slit we place a quarter - wave plate , with the fast axis at an angle of @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) with respect to the photon polarization direction .",
    "upon traversing either one of the waveplates , the photon becomes circularly polarized , and acquires a well - defined angular momentum @xcite .",
    "supposing that the waveplate is free to rotate , it should acquire an angular momentum opposite to that of the photon , and rotate right or left , depending on the chirality of the photon .",
    "if we treat each waveplate as a quantum rotor , we can say that the photon induced a transition with @xmath21 .",
    "since the waveplates do nt significantly modify the propagation of the beam , we have , in principle , a which - path marker with necessary characteristics for a quantum eraser . however , this scheme is far from being practical . besides the difficulty to set the waveplates free to rotate , the separation between the energy levels of a rotor with the mass and dimensions of a waveplate is of the order @xmath22 ev .",
    "in addition , decoherence effects may make it impossible to use macroscopic quantum rotors to mark the path of a photon .",
    "this idea is similar to the  haunted measurement \" of greenberger and yasin @xcite .    by enlarging the system , however",
    ", it is possible to create an adequate which - path detector .",
    "let the beam of photons incident on the double - slit be entangled with a second beam freely propagating in another direction , so as to define a bell state @xmath23 where the indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 indicate the two beams , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent orthogonal linear polarizations . if beam @xmath24 is incident on the double - slit ( without waveplates ) , state ( [ eq : state1 ] )",
    "is transformed to @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 the indices @xmath31 and @xmath32 refer to beams generated by slit @xmath3 and slit @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the probability distribution for one - photon detection on a screen placed in the far field region of the overlapping beams @xmath31 @xmath32 will show the usual interference : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the phase difference between the paths : slit @xmath35 detector and slit @xmath36 detector . introducing the @xmath37 plates one in front of each slit with the fast axes at angles @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with the @xmath26 direction , states @xmath40 and @xmath41 are transformed to @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 represent right and left circular polarizations . since @xmath40 and @xmath41 have orthogonal polarizations , there is no possibility of interference .",
    "in order to recover interference , let us project the state of the system over the symmetric and antisymmetric states of the which - path detector .",
    "this is equivalent to transforming @xmath40 and @xmath41 in a way that expresses them as symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of polarizations , for example , @xmath46",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 where `` @xmath50 '' and `` @xmath51 '' represent polarizations @xmath52 and @xmath20 with respect to @xmath26 . rewriting the complete state @xmath16 , we have @xmath53 \\label{eq : psisym}\\ ] ] according to the above expression , we can recover interference projecting the state of photon @xmath25 over @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "experimentally , this can be done by placing a polarizer in the path of beam @xmath25 and orientating it at + 45@xmath56 to select @xmath54 or at -45@xmath56 to select @xmath55 .",
    "the interference pattern is recovered through the coincidence detection of photons @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "notice that the fringes obtained in the two cases are out of phase .",
    "they are commonly called _ fringes _ and _ anti - fringes_.      which - path information can be obtained by considering the polarization of both photons @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the process of obtaining information can be separated into two schemes : detecting @xmath25 before @xmath24 , or detecting @xmath24 before @xmath25 , which we refer to as _ delayed erasure_. this can be done by changing the relative lengths of beams @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we will assume that one photon is detected much earlier than the arrival of the other photon at the measuring devices .",
    "let us consider the first possibility .",
    "if photon @xmath25 is detected with polarization @xmath26 ( say ) , then we know that photon @xmath24 has polarization @xmath27 before hitting the @xmath37 plates and the double slit . by looking at equations ( [ eq : placa1 ] ) , ( [ eq : placa2 ] ) and ( [ eq : placa3 ] ) ) it is clear that detection of photon @xmath24 ( after the double slit ) with polarization @xmath44 is compatible only with the passage of @xmath24 through slit @xmath3 and polarization @xmath45 is compatible only with the passage of @xmath24 through slit @xmath4 .",
    "this can be verified experimentally . in usual quantum mechanics",
    "language , detection of photon @xmath25 before photon @xmath24 has prepared photon @xmath24 in a certain state .      the possibility of obtaining which - path information after the detection of photon @xmath24 leads to delayed choice @xcite .",
    "delayed choice creates situations in which it is important to have a clear notion of the physical significance of quantum mechanics .",
    "a good discussion can be found in references @xcite . in as much as our quantum eraser",
    "does not allow the experimenter to _ choose _ to observe which - path information or an interference pattern after the detection of photon @xmath24 , it does allow for the detection of photon @xmath24 before photon @xmath25 , a situation to which we refer to as _",
    "delayed erasure_. the question is :  does the order of detection of the two photons affect the experimental results ? \"",

    "@xmath60 is a relative phase shift due to the crystal birrefringence .",
    "if @xmath61 or @xmath62 we have the bell states @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .    using this state in the interferometer described in the previous section , the probability of detecting photons in coincidence is proportional to @xmath65\\sin{\\delta},\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is defined right after expression ( [ eq : prob1 ] ) , @xmath66 is the smallest angle between the fast ( slow ) axis of the quarter - wave plates and the @xmath58 axis and @xmath67 is the angle of the polarizer in path @xmath25 , with respect to the @xmath58 axis .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "an argon laser ( 351.1 nm at @xmath68 mw ) is used to pump a 1 mm long bbo ( @xmath69-bab@xmath70o@xmath71 ) crystal , generating @xmath72 nm entangled photons by spontaneous parametric down - conversion .",
    "the bbo crystal is cut for type - ii phase matching .",
    "the pump beam is focused onto the crystal plane using a 1 m focal length lens to the increase transverse coherence length at the double - slit .",
    "the width of the pump beam at the focus is approximately @xmath73mm@xcite .",
    "the orthogonally polarized entangled photons leave the bbo crystal each at an angle of @xmath74 with the pump beam . in the path of photon @xmath25 a polarizer cube ( pol1 )",
    "can be inserted in order to perform the quantum erasure .",
    "the double - slit and quarter - wave plates are placed in path @xmath24 , 42 cm from the bbo crystal .",
    "detectors @xmath75 and @xmath76 are located 125 cm and 98 cm from the bbo crystal , respectively .",
    "qwp1 and qwp2 are quarter - wave plates with fast axes at an angle of 45@xmath77 .",

    "before the quantum eraser experiment was performed , bell s inequality tests were performed to verify that entangled states were being detected @xcite .",

    "next , the path of photon @xmath24 was marked by placing the quarter - wave plates qwp1 and qwp2 in front of the double - slit .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the absence of interference due to the quarter - wave plates .",
