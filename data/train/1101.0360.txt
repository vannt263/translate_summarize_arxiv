    "as mentioned above , our algorithm is convergent provided that a sufficient number of discretization points is introduced . for systems considered here , this number should not be smaller than 100 .",
    "if the laser field is very weak , this does not create significant numerical problems , except that calculations become longer .",
    "however , when the laser field is sufficiently intense , the algorithm based on the transfer matrix is unstable .",
    "this instability is due to the existence of closed channels , which introduce into numerical calculations very small and very large numbers at the same time . augmenting precisions",
    "significantly slows down the calculation and does not diminish the problem .",
    "we have found that it is possible to make this algorithm numerically stable by just applying nonlinear matrix transformations , without introducing higher precisions .",
    "illustrations presented in this paper show that tunneling of electrons through multi - barrier semiconductor structures can be changed significantly by applied nonperturbative electric fields : oscillating in time or constant .",
    "the efficiency of the algorithm presented in this contribution opens up the possibility of investigating surface phenomena ( like photoemission or high - order harmonic generation ) in the presence of more realistic laser pulses that gradually decrease within solids and extend on a mesoscopic scale in vacuum .",
    "these problems are under investigations",
