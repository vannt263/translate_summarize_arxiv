    "various interpretations of the high redshift data have been offered .",
    "physical explanations for the apparent evolution from @xmath0 to @xmath17 include dramatic mass loss ( fan et  al .",

    "all these models have some observational support , but it is not yet clear whether any single model is currently capable of simultaneously explaining the properties of galaxies at @xmath0 and at @xmath17 .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the data are interpreted incorrectly , due to errors in photometric redshifts , the conversion from light to stellar mass , the conversion from light - weighted to mass - weighted radii , or other effects .",
    "it is well known that absolute mass measurements of distant galaxies are very difficult , even with excellent data ( see , e.g. , muzzin et al .  2009a , b for an extended discussion ) .",
    "furthermore , sizes are typically determined from data that do not sample the profiles much beyond the effective radius @xmath23 ( see , e.g. , hopkins et al .",

    "ideally , we would measure the mass density profiles of galaxies well beyond @xmath23 for large and homogeneously selected samples as a function of redshift . in this paper , we take some steps in this direction by measuring the average surface brightness profiles of galaxies at @xmath24 .",

    "the surface brightness profiles are measured from stacked images , which have a depth equivalent to @xmath25hrs of exposure time on a 4 m class telescope .",
    "this depth allows us to trace the surface brightness profiles to @xmath26 ab magarcsec@xmath9 , which is ( just ) sufficient to determine whether the outer envelopes of massive galaxies were already in place at early times .",
    "as we show in this paper , a self - consistent description of the structural evolution of massive galaxies can be obtained from sufficiently deep and wide photometric surveys .",

    "2008 ; franx et  al .",
    "2008 ; dekel et  al .",
    "furthermore , the galaxies that are accreted at @xmath47 may well have formed some fraction of their stars at @xmath199 .",
    "it seems likely that star formation also dominated at @xmath200 ; as noted by many authors , the formation of the compact cores of elliptical galaxies was almost certainly a highly dissipative process ( see , e.g. , kormendy et  al .",
    "2009 , and references therein ) .",

    "interestingly , we find that the shut - off is a rather sudden event , with the star formation rate dropping by a factor of 20 from @xmath0 to @xmath63 whereas the stellar mass grows only by a factor of 1.4 over this redshift range .",
    "this may suggest that the quenching trigger is not only a simple ( stellar ) mass threshold , as the range of masses in our selection bin is a factor of 2 at each redshift  larger than the evolution in the median mass .",
    "we note that the stellar mass threshold that we would derive is @xmath201 .",

    "the most obvious is to study the profiles of individual galaxies to large radii . even though the stacking procedure should give reasonably accurate mean radii , the measured mean profile shape ( parameterized by the sersic @xmath13 parameter ) can be in error ( see appendix b ) .",
    "furthermore , valuable information is obviously lost  for example , the rich diversity of massive galaxies at @xmath202 ( see kriek et al.2009b )  and the interpretation rests on several simplifying assumptions .",
    "the most important of these may be that all the galaxies that enter the stacks evolve in a somewhat homogenous way .",
    "it may well be that the samples consist of quite distinct populations whose relative number fractions change with time .",
    "we would interpret this as smooth evolution , whereas in reality there might be few individual galaxies that actually have the mean properties that we measure .",
    "such effects are likely important at @xmath140 as our sample contains both quiescent and star forming galaxies at these redshifts , and they form quite distinct populations ( e.g. , kriek et al .",
    "2009b , brammer et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the population is likely more homogeneous at lower redshifts . at present studying surface brightness profiles of individual galaxies to very faint limits",
    "is only possible at low redshift ( e.g. , kormendy et  al .",
    "2009 , tal et al .",
    "2009 ) , but progress can be expected from ongoing deep ground- and space - based surveys .",
    "we also assume that our samples are complete and unbiased at all redshifts , but there could be biases against very extended galaxies at the highest redshifts .",
    "we verified that individual galaxies with the properties of the @xmath62 stack would be detected ( with approximately the correct flux ) at @xmath0 , but more extreme objects may have escaped detection .",
    "it will also be worthwhile to stack images with better spatial resolution .",
    "the highest redshift galaxies in our study are not resolved within the effective radius , and this may lead to biases in the sersic fits .",
    "one of the main uncertainties is the analysis is the conversion from rest - frame @xmath5 band light to mass .",
    "we know that the @xmath166 ratio is not constant with radius even at @xmath17 , and we find good evidence for strong radial trends at higher redshift .",
    "it seems therefore possible that we might be overestimating the half - mass radii of galaxies at @xmath0 by a larger factor than we are overestimating the radii at @xmath17 .",

    "upcoming surveys with wfc3 on hst will resolve this issue , and allow derivation of mass - weighted radii .",
    "finally , we have mostly ignored the effects of dark matter in this paper , and of possible evolution in the imf ( e.g. , van dokkum 2008 , dav 2008 , wilkins et al .",

    "in this paper we select galaxies at a constant number density , as opposed to a constant luminosity or mass . at each redshift galaxies",
    "are selected in a narrow mass bin whose median mass corresponds to the mass appropriate for the chosen number density ( see  [ select.sec ] ) .",
    "this selection is appropriate for processes that change the masses of galaxies and not their number densities , such as star formation and mass loss .",
    "however , mergers change both the mass and the number density of galaxies , and might be expected to complicate the selection .",
    "the effect of mergers on our selection was assessed with monte carlo simulations .",
    "a sample of 50,000 galaxies was created , distributed according to a schechter ( 1976 ) mass function with characteristic mass @xmath203 and faint - end slope @xmath204 , over the mass range @xmath205 .",
    "the simulation is independent of the precise value of @xmath206 ; the value we chose is intermediate between two recent studies ( marchesini et  al . 2009 ; kajisawa et  al .",
    "the left - most panel of fig .",
    "[ sim.plot ] shows the high - mass end of this mass function .",
    "the horizontal line in this panel is an ( arbitrarily chosen ) constant number density of @xmath207 galaxies per bin .",

    "mergers of galaxies with mass ratios between @xmath55 and @xmath56 have equal probability .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar if other limits are assumed , such as a constant @xmath211 ratio .",
    "the red histogram at @xmath210 shows the distribution of galaxies that have at least one progenitor whose original mass was in the range @xmath212 .",
    "the distribution is shifted and has broadened , but the median mass is very similar to the mass of galaxies with a number density of @xmath213 .",
    "similarly , the merger remnants are merged with each other from @xmath210 to @xmath214 and again from @xmath214 to @xmath215 .",
    "we applied the same selection method as used in  [ select.sec ] to the simulated sample .",
    "exponential functions were fit to the high mass end of the mass function ( solid lines in fig .",

    "next , we selected galaxies in a mass bin of width @xmath69 dex centered on the evolving mass .",

    "this fraction is @xmath217% for a factor of two mass evolution , but we note that all of these galaxies had original masses close to the selected range .    in summary , a selection at constant number density should give a fairly homogeneous sample of galaxies as a function of redshift . mass evolution",
    "can be measured directly in a self - consistent way , regardless of the physical process ( star formation or mergers ) . in reality mergers",
    "likely dominate at the high - mass end of the mass function and star formation likely dominates at the low - mass end ( e.g. , guo & white 2008 ; damen et  al .",
    "we note that our simple simulation demonstrates that the observed average mass growth of a factor of two at high masses can be explained by three mergers with random mass ratio between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the selection does not produce homogeneous samples if growth occurs through @xmath218 mergers only ( and no other mergers ) , but that is exceedingly unlikely ( see , e.g. , van dokkum 2005 ; naab et  al .",
    "2007 ; guo & white 2008 ) .",
    "a key aspect of this study is that structural parameters are not measured from individual images and then averaged but measured from averaged images of many individual galaxies .",
    "we tested how well the structural parameters @xmath23 and @xmath13 can be recovered with this method by creating stacks of simulated galaxies and by analyzing real galaxies .",
    "model galaxies were created with galfit ( peng et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "their sersic indices are distributed randomly between @xmath219 and @xmath133 , their axis ratios range from @xmath220 to @xmath221 , and they have random position angles .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the assumed distribution of @xmath13 or @xmath222 .",
    "ten stacks were created of 200 galaxies each .",
    "the ten stacks differ in their distributions of circularized effective radii .",
    "the radii were chosen randomly within the range @xmath223 , with @xmath224 ranging from @xmath225kpc to @xmath226kpc . prior to stacking the galaxies were placed at @xmath0 , convolved with a moffat psf with a fwhm of @xmath227 , and sampled with @xmath33 pixels .",
    "the stacked images were fit with galfit and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ stackcheck.plot ] ( black lines ) .",
    "the circularized effective radii are recovered well , even for @xmath228kpc .",
    "this is remarkable as these scales correspond to @xmath229 , a small fraction of the fwhm of the psf .",
    "broken lines and solid lines are for two different ways of averaging the effective radii of individual galaxies : solid lines show averages of @xmath109 and broken lines are for the logarithm of the average @xmath23 .",
    "the stacks clearly measure the average of @xmath23 rather than the average of @xmath109 but the differences are small .",
    "the right panel shows how well the average sersic index is recovered .",
    "the stacks systematically overestimate the sersic index .",
    "this can be understood by considering the average profile of a small galaxy and a large galaxy , both with @xmath219 .",
    "the small galaxy will add a peak at small radii to the extended profile of the large galaxy , creating a profile best fit by a model with larger @xmath13 .",
    "the noiseless test is useful as it demonstrates that the stacking technique can give results that can be compared directly with measurements of individual galaxies .",
    "however , in order to assess the systematic errors associated with our methodology centroiding errors and noise need to be taken into account .",
    "centroiding errors were simulated by shifting the individual images by small amounts , using the same third order polynomial interpolation as was used for the real data .",
    "the shifts were drawn from a gaussian distribution with @xmath230 pixels ( 2.1 kpc ) .",
    "blue curves in fig .",
    "[ stackcheck.plot ] show the effects of these shifts on the recovered parameters .",
    "as expected , the smoothing leads to an overestimate of the effective radius . however , the effect is fairly small because the profiles at larger radii are not strongly affected by the centroiding errors .",
    "the average sersic parameter is actually _",
    "better _ determined when small shifts are included , probably because the central peak ( caused by galaxies with small @xmath23 ) is smeared out in the stacks .",
    "finally , noise was added to the modeled stacks .",
    "a noise image was created from the actual residual map of the @xmath0 stack , thus ensuring that the noise level , correlations between pixels , and non - gaussian components are all exactly identical to the actual data .",
    "the @xmath0 stack has the highest noise of our four stacks as the galaxies are fainter than those at lower redshift .",
    "the noise images were added to the artificial stacks , and structural parameters were remeasured .",
    "the red curves in fig .",
    "[ stackcheck.plot ] show the results .",
    "they are quite similar to the blue curves , suggesting that systematic effects dominate over the effects of noise . in summary",
    ", we should be able to determine effective radii and sersic @xmath13 parameters with reasonable accuracy despite the poor spatial resolution of our data , if the surface brightness profiles are well described by sersic fits .",
    "real galaxies do not necessarily follow sersic profiles , and subtle deviations for individual galaxies may lead to significant systematic differences when determining structural parameters from stacked data .",
    "we first test whether the structural parameters that we derive for the stacked @xmath17 obey sample ( see appendix d ) are consistent with the average of the individual galaxies .",
    "we fitted sersic ( 1968 ) profiles and determined circularized effective radii in kpc and the sersic @xmath13 parameter for each of the 14 galaxies that enter the obey stack .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ obeystack.plot ] .",
    "we find @xmath231kpc and @xmath232 .",
    "the structural parameters measured from the stacked image are very similar at @xmath233kpc , @xmath234 , and we conclude that the stacking method gives reasonable results for real galaxies .",
    "next , we assess the importance of redshift - dependent effects by redshifting the @xmath17 obey stack and the @xmath62 nmbs stack to @xmath0 . the angular scale and fluxes of the profiles of the obey galaxies",
    "were corrected to @xmath0 , the galaxies were convolved with the nmbs psf , the images were resampled to match the nmbs resolution of @xmath33 pixel@xmath30 , and empirical noise derived from empty regions of the actual nmbs images was added .",
    "the @xmath62 images were only scaled in flux , as they have a similar psf and spatial scale as the @xmath0 images .",
    "noise was added in the same way as for the obey stack .",
    "the resulting redshifted images are shown in fig .",
    "[ z2shift.plot ] , along with the actual @xmath0 stack . to highlight the differences in profile shape the images were normalized to the peak flux .",
    "it is clear that the actual @xmath0 image is more compact than the redshifted @xmath17 and @xmath62 stacks , as it lacks the low surface brightness features that surround the bright cores in the lower redshift stacks .",
    "we quantified the effects of redshifting by fitting sersic profiles to the redshifted stacks .",
    "the redshifted obey stack gives @xmath235kpc and @xmath236 , in good agreement with the original values ( @xmath233kpc , @xmath234 ) .",
    "the redshifted @xmath62 stack gives @xmath237kpc and @xmath238 , again in good agreement with the original values ( @xmath239kpc , @xmath240 ) . from these tests",
    "we conclude that there are no obvious redshift - dependent effects which could lead to severe biases in the derived evolution .",
    "here we show the individual images of galaxies that enter the stacks .",
    "the data over the redshift range @xmath241 are analyzed in a self - consistent way , and are all drawn from the same survey ( the newfirm medium band survey , or nmbs ) .",
    "although essentially all the results presented in this paper could be derived from the nmbs data alone , we made some effort to construct a @xmath17 sample that can be analyzed in the same way as the data at higher redshift .",
    "key requirements are that the masses are on the same system as the high @xmath242 data and that very deep photometry is available to probe the faint outer regions of the galaxies .",
    "we use data from a recent public survey of luminous elliptical galaxies , called observations of bright ellipticals at yale ( obey ) ( tal et  al .",

    "owing to very careful flatfielding the surface brightness profiles can be reliably traced to large radii .",
    "the data are publicly available .",
    "we determined stellar masses for the galaxies in the obey sample in the following way .",

    "the `` extrapolated ''",
    "total @xmath247 magnitudes were used together with `` effective '' luminosity - weighted @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 , and @xmath251 colors to create @xmath252 seds .",
    "the apparent magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction using the estimates from schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) and converted to absolute magnitudes using the distances given in tully ( 1988 ) ( corrected to our cosmology ) .",
    "stellar masses were determined using fast ( kriek et  al .",
    "2009a ) , a code that fits stellar population synthesis models to observed photometry .",
    "this code was also used to determine the stellar masses of the galaxies in the nmbs , and we used the same stellar population synthesis model , dust law , and other parameters as were used for the fits to the distant galaxies ( see  [ nmbs.sec ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that we fixed the value of the characteristic star formation timescale @xmath253 to 1gyr .",
    "if @xmath253 , age , and @xmath254 are all free parameters the fits show aliasing due to the limited number of data points .",
    "we verified that this small change to the fitting procedure does not lead to systematic biases in the masses .",

    "we note that for one of these galaxies we adopted a different distance than is listed in the tully ( 1988 ) atlas : for ngc4594 ( m104 ) we used a distance of 9.1mpc ( jensen et  al .",
