    "the current cutting - edge technology has developed seeking the realization of quantum information and quantum computation .",
    "for such realization , the mathematical modeling of the system of some quantum devices will play an important role .",
    "one of the candidates for qubit is electron spin , that is , the so - called _ electron - spin qubit _ or the _ spintronic qubit _ , from the point of the view of spintronics @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the transportation of a single electron as a qubit has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite as well as the spin - conserved transport tunneling through a junction was experimentally demonstrated in organic spintronics @xcite . in addition , the spin - flip and the phase - shift was demonstrated in the experiment for the spin state of an electron - hole pair in a semiconductor quantum dot @xcite , while the spin alignment was studied in the process of the spin - transport in organic spintronics @xcite .",
    "the experimental development makes us hopeful that an integrated circuit for qubit and a quantum network are really demonstrated in future .",
    "this paper deals with the dirac particle living in the configuration space consisting of the two quantum wires and a junction for the spintronic qubit .",
    "although we actually have to determine a concrete physical object for the junction , we regard the junction as a black box so that it has mathematical arbitrariness .",
    "we regard the wires as the union of the intervals , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , for mathematical simplicity .",
    "namely , the segment @xmath3 $ ] with length @xmath4 plays a role of the junction .",
    "many physicists have investigated the individual boundary condition of the wave functions of the dirac particle for the corresponding self - adjoint extension of the dirac operator in the case of the point interaction ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) @xcite . meanwhile , the dirac operator consists of the combination of the dirac matrices and the momentum operator of electron .",
    "the boundary conditions of the self - adjoint extensions of the momentum operators have been studied by mathematicians @xcite .",
    "we note that there is a general theory in mathematics , called boundary triple , to handle the boundary condition , and the theory has still been developed @xcite . in refs.@xcite",
    "the appearance of a phase factor was proved for the schrdinger particle under the same mathematical set - up as ours . for our dirac particle , in the case where @xmath5 , benvegn and dabrowski showed that a phase factor appears in their four - parameter family ( see eq.(15 ) of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in addition , they showed how the boundary condition affects the spin .",
    "the description of boundary condition by the individual one - parameter families have been studied in refs.@xcite ( also see eqs.(17 ) and ( 18 ) of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we will go ahead and make an in - depth research for the dirac particle .",
    "thus , we employ the minimal dirac operator for the hamiltonian . in this paper , we follow the machinery in refs.@xcite based on the von neumann s theory @xcite , in which all the self - adjoint extensions of our minimal dirac operator are parameterized by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is unitary group of degree @xmath8 .",
    "we prove that all the boundary conditions of wave functions of our dirac particle are completely classified into the two types ( see corollary [ cor : theo-2 ] ) .",
    "one of them is the type that states the wave functions do not pass through the junction , and described by two parameters , @xmath9 with @xmath10 , concerned with the reflections at @xmath11 and at @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the other is the type that states the wave functions do pass through the junction , and described by benvegn and dabrowski s four - parameter family ( see theorem [ theo:1 ] , theorem [ theo:2 ] , and proposition [ prop:06 ] ) .",
    "we give our concrete formulae showing the one - to - one correspondence between the boundary conditions of wave functions of our dirac particle and the self - adjoint extensions of the minimal dirac operator ( see theorem [ theo:2 ] , and propositions [ prop:03 ] , [ prop : inverse ] , [ prop:06 ] ) .",
    "our formulae states that benvegn and dabrowski s four - parameter family can be characterized by three parameters , @xmath13 with @xmath14 , concerned with the reflection , penetration , and phase factor , respectively ( see corollary [ cor : bd->3 ] ) . to obtain our formulae",
    ", we invent our representation of @xmath7 in proposition [ prop:03 ] .",

    "since von neumann s theory gives the form of the wave functions , we can grasp how they pass through the junction . on the other hand , the boundary which is not characterized by the benvegn and dabrowski",
    "s four - parameter family is the case where the wave functions never infiltrate the junction , which is characterized by the two parameters .",
    "as is well known , this case is also important , for instance , to demonstrate the aharonov - bohm effect experimentally @xcite .",
    "thus , through our observation along with benvegn and dabrowski s result , we understood that , for the wave functions which pass through the junction , the boundary condition has its own relation between the phase factor and the electron spin .",
    "the results may suggest a mathematical possibility of making a device for switching the channel of qubit . there is a case of the two units in fig.[fig : units ] :",
    "the unit0 accepts the wave functions with the boundary condition bc0 only , and refuses the wave functions with another boundary condition . on the other hand",
    ", the unit1 welcomes the wave functions with the boundary condition bc1 different from bc0 , though it rejects the wave functions with the boundary condition bc0 .",
    "for instance , as shown in eqs.([eq : spin - flip ] ) and ( [ eq : no - spin - flip ] ) below , we can use unit0 for the channel without spin - flip and unit1 for the channel with spin - flip as well as we can use the units for channels for the phase - shifted qubit .",

    "we should remember the experimental demonstration of the flying qubit @xcite , which is realized by the presence of an electron in either channel of the wire of an aharonov - bohm ring .",
    "theorem [ theo:2 ] shows the correspondence : @xmath327 theorem [ theo:2 ] assures us that _ there is no boundary condition which makes a self - adjoint extension but conditions , ( [ bc - rho ] ) and ( [ bc - alpha])_. these two conditions make the broad difference : the solitariness in the boundary condition ( [ bc - rho ] ) , @xmath328 and @xmath329 both of boundary conditions in the left island and the right one are independent of each other , which says that _ there is no interchange between the wave functions living in the left island @xmath330 and those living in the right island @xmath331 _ because the information of the wave functions never infiltrates the junction . in addition , _ no special phase factor but @xmath332 appears in this boundary condition then_.    on the other hand , according to eq.(15 ) of ref.@xcite described by the benvegn and dabrowski s four - parameter family with the representation proposition [ prop:06 ] , the boundary condition ( [ bc - alpha ] ) shows _ how the wave functions living in the left island and the those living in the right island make interchange between each other _ , and _ how the electron spin is affected by the phase factor at the boundaries _ : @xmath333 for some @xmath334 , @xmath335 , with @xmath336 .",

    "we set the pauli - x gate in the disc of junctions .",
    "then , the residence of the wave functions living in unit0 is switched to unit1 after the pauli - x gate operation .",
    "that is , we have a spin - based switching device for qubit .",
    "thus , there is a possibility that we can use this switching device for quantum state transfer from spintronic qubit regarding unit0 and unit1 as qubit . in the same way , if we employ eq.([eq : no - spin - flip ] ) with @xmath348 and @xmath352 for unit1 instead , we can make a phase - based switching device for qubit .",
    "this means that we may control the qubit consisting of unit0 and unit1 through the phase factor @xmath299 .",
    "we note that both the spin - flip gate operation and the phase - shift gate operation had been demonstrated in the experiment for the spin state of an electron - hole pair in a semiconductor quantum dot @xcite .",
