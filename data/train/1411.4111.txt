    "the sequence of binomial coefficients is one of the most well - studied , frequently - used , and generally significant sequences in all of mathematics .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , that the analysis of repeated binomial coefficients ( coefficients which occur more often than the trivial two times which every number occurs ) has only received sustained attention in the past 50 years . clearly , many numbers occur three and four times ; these are what fill up the inside of pascal s triangle . however , the only other high multiplicities known to occur6 and 8are rare , and the patterns in which they appear are not well understood .    however , some scattered progress has been made .",
    "it has been shown by abbott _",
    "[ 1 ] that the function @xmath7 which counts the number of ways of representing @xmath6 as a binomial coefficient has average order and normal order 2 .",
    "all solutions to @xmath8 were found by avanesov [ 2 , referenced in 10 ] , and kiss [ 10 ] established the more general result of finiteness of solutions to @xmath9 , for @xmath10 a prime .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 have also been completely solved by de weger [ 17 ] .",
    "more recently , bugeaud _ et al . _",
    "[ 4 ] have found all solutions to @xmath13 using an improvement of the mordell - weil sieve , which is applicable to finding integral points on all hyperelliptic curves .    perhaps the most striking result was found by lind [ 11 ] , who showed that if @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-th fibonacci number ) , then @xmath18 .",
    "david singmaster [ 16 ] also provided a proof of this , and noted that his result provides an infinite family of numbers with multiplicity at least 6 .",
    "the first member of this family3003is also the only known number with multiplicity 8 .",
    "singmaster [ 15 ] also made the following dramatic conjecture , the study of which has been an important feature of subsequent work on repeated binomial coefficients : if @xmath7 denotes the number of times @xmath6 occurs in pascal s triangle , @xmath19 .",
    "there has been no direct attempt at proving the existence of such a finite upper bound on the number of ways @xmath6 may be represented as a binomial coefficient .",
    "bounds on @xmath7 in terms of @xmath6 were obtained first by singmaster [ 15 ] , then by abbott _",
    "[ 1 ] , and then by kane [ 8 ] .",
    "currently the best unconditional bound is @xmath20 , obtained by kane [ 9 ] via an argument relating integer solutions of @xmath21 to derivatives of a function implicitly defined in terms of the @xmath22-function .",
    "conditional on cramr s conjecture about small gaps between prime numbers , abbott _",
    "[ 1 ] obtained @xmath23 .",
    "the purpose here will be to provide information about generalizations of the equation solved by lind [ 11 ] and singmaster [ 16 ] : @xmath18 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath24 .",
    "however , to our knowledge , no studies of equations of the general form @xmath25 have been made .",
    "we will present two independent results about the solutions to such equations ; one describes where solutions may occur , and the other asserts the finiteness of solutions ( in most cases ) . we will also provide a rationale for why considering such equations may provide a powerful framework for proving the singmaster conjecture itself .",
    "first , we make the following basic proposition about the location of repeats .    let @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 be natural numbers such that @xmath28 ; let @xmath29 be the positive number defined by @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath1 , we have @xmath31 .",
    "first , note the elementary fact that any entry in pascal s triangle may be written as the sum of the two entries above it : @xmath32 .",
    "this process may be iterated to obtain a representation of @xmath33 as a sum of binomial coefficients of any row number less than @xmath34 .",
    "for example , with two and three iterations , we obtain , respectively , @xmath35 @xmath36 that the coefficients appearing in the @xmath37-th such iterate correspond to the binomial coefficients of row @xmath37 follows from the observation that when generating the coefficient for the next term with @xmath38 , one adds together the coefficients of the current terms with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this is exactly the process which ordinarily generates the binomial coefficients in pascal s triangle .",
    "we therefore may always write the equation @xmath1 as @xmath40 next , we note that if @xmath41 and @xmath34 and @xmath42 are large , the ratios of successive binomial coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and so on , are strictly decreasing , and are close to being constant .",
    "specifically , @xmath45 .",
    "suppose we call the ratios @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and so on",
    ". then we may rewrite ( 1 ) as @xmath52 when @xmath26 and @xmath27 are very large in comparison to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , all the @xmath53 are approximately the same ( because of the expression for the ratio of successive binomial coefficients ) , and hence by the binomial theorem are all approximately the ( positive ) solution of @xmath54 .",
    "\\(2 ) would be true if @xmath55 .",
    "however , because of the strict decrease mentioned above , we have @xmath56 .",
    "suppose , then , that @xmath57 . then all the @xmath53 are , and the right side of ( 2 ) has experienced a proportional decrease from @xmath58 which is the product of all the proportional decreases in the individual @xmath53 .",
    "however , the left side can not have experienced so great a decrease from @xmath59 , since no term has decreased proportionally more than the right side , and there is one term ( the constant , 1 ) which has not decreased at all .",
    "thus the equation ( 2 ) can no longer be true .",
    "we apply the same argument to find that @xmath60 can not be greater than @xmath29 .",
    "writing out @xmath61 and @xmath62 yields the inequality in the proposition .",
    "we must impose the condition @xmath28 , because in reformulating equation ( 1 ) as equation ( 2 ) , we have assumed that we may divide through by the leftmost term @xmath63 , which is nonzero iff @xmath28 .    if @xmath64 , the equation @xmath1 has finitely many solutions in natural numbers @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "any such equation can be written as the equation of an algebraic curve @xmath65 @xmath66 in @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "for example , the equation @xmath67 , which singmaster [ 16 ] solved , corresponds to the curve @xmath68 .",
    "this means that the proof of the theorem is reduced to the well - studied problem of determining whether an algebraic curve has an infinity of lattice points . for an individual curve , the standard approach to such",
    "a problem is to determine that the curve is irreducible and has genus greater than 0 .",
    "if so , then by siegel s theorem [ 7 , p. 353 ]",
    "the set of lattice points on the curve is finite .",
    "however , determining the genus alone requires an analysis of singularities [ 7 , p. 72 ] .",
    "this , in turn , amounts to solving the system where the three partial derivatives of the homogeneous version of the curve are simultaneously equated to zero [ 5 , p. 19 ] ; a task which appears to be unattackable for general curves of this complexity .    we therefore will not attempt to prove that siegel s theorem is directly applicable to these curves , but",
    "instead will make use of the following criterion given by nagell ( originally due to maillet ) [ 12 , p. 264 ] .    a unicursal [ genus 0 ] curve passes through an infinity of lattice points if and only if there exists a parametric representation of the form @xmath69 where @xmath34 is a natural number , and where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are integral polynomials in @xmath6 satisfying one of the following conditions : + 1 .",
    "either @xmath73 with @xmath74 or @xmath75 ; @xmath70 and @xmath71 are both of degree @xmath34 ; + 2 .",
    "@xmath76 is irreducible , and @xmath77 , @xmath78 ; @xmath70 and @xmath71 are both of degree @xmath79 ; the form @xmath80 can represent for integral values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 a certain integer @xmath83 such that @xmath84 divides all the coefficients of both @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "+ nagell goes on to state that shortly after maillet gave this criterion , siegel proved that it applies to all curves ( i.e. not just unicursal ones ) .    to apply this criterion to our curves",
    ", it will be necessary to consider the limiting behavior as @xmath85 .",
    "we may assume the curves have points of arbitrarily large @xmath27 ; if they did not , they could not have arbitrarily large @xmath26 either ( since clearly @xmath86 ) and so could only pass through finitely many points with natural @xmath26 , @xmath27 , which are the only points which matter for the theorem about binomial coefficients .",
    "qualitatively , it is clear that @xmath87 must be such that the highest total degree terms in the equation of @xmath65 almost cancel each other out as @xmath88 . formally if @xmath89 is the @xmath34-th term with total degree @xmath90 , @xmath91 because otherwise , for large @xmath27 , the value of @xmath92 would be the only @xmath93 term in @xmath65 .",
    "there would be other terms @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and so on , but even a direct sum of these is not @xmath93 , and they clearly are not all summed together .",
    "what is the sum of the highest total degree terms in ( 3 ) ?",
    "the degree @xmath90 terms from the first product , @xmath96 , are simply the terms of @xmath97 . there is only one degree @xmath90 term in the second product ; it is @xmath98 . equation ( 4 ) then becomes @xmath99 @xmath100    therefore , if we take @xmath101 , we must have @xmath102 .    now , consider the form of @xmath87 if there exists a parametric representation as described in nagell s [ 12 , p. 264",
    "] criterion .",
    "if @xmath75 , @xmath103 , and @xmath27 goes to @xmath104 as @xmath6 does .",
    "this means that @xmath105 , which has a constant , rational value , because @xmath106 and @xmath107 are integral polynomials of the same degree in @xmath6 .",
    "this can not be the case , because a simple application of the rational root test shows that @xmath108 is irrational .    by nagell s criterion",
    ", it must then be that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given by rational functions of @xmath6 with numerator and denominator polynomials of the same degree .",
    "then @xmath27 can only approach infinity when @xmath6 approaches one of the roots of the denominator , @xmath72 , i. e. when @xmath6 approaches either a rational or quadratic irrational number @xmath109 .",
    "we thus have that @xmath110 .",
    "@xmath111 is clearly the quotient of two quadratic irrationals ; because @xmath112 and @xmath113 have the same input @xmath109 , the number under the radical in both quadratic irrationals is the same .",
    "this means that the quotient is itself a quadratic irrational , by rationalization of denominators .",
    "we will now show that if @xmath114 , @xmath108 can not be a quadratic irrational , and hence no parametrization of the type described can exist . for convenience , we will work with the equation @xmath115 , instead of the original @xmath116 ; the former is shifted 1 unit to the left , and obviously has quadratic zeros iff the original does .",
    "if @xmath34 and @xmath37 are such that @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the polynomial @xmath119 has no real roots of degree 2 .    we will attack this by showing that it is impossible for @xmath120 to have a quadratic factor with positive discriminant .",
    "we begin by noting that since @xmath121 is primitive , by gauss lemma [ 13 , p. 49 ] , it suffices to consider quadratic factors with integral coefficients .",
    "since the first and last terms of @xmath121 have magnitude 1 , any such factor must be of the form @xmath122 or @xmath123 , with @xmath124 .",
    "also note that by descartes sign test , @xmath121 has exactly 1 positive root . make the substitution @xmath125 , generating the new polynomial @xmath126 , which has been shifted 1 unit to the right .",
    "substituting @xmath127 for @xmath26 in @xmath128 , we see that regardless of the parity of @xmath34 and @xmath37 , there are no sign changes .",
    "thus , @xmath128 has no negative roots .",
    "we conclude that @xmath121 has no negative roots smaller than @xmath129 .",
    "we have @xmath130 , and @xmath131 , depending on whether @xmath34 is even or odd .",
    "this means that any quadratic factor @xmath132 must take the values @xmath133 at @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "if @xmath136 , we have the following four cases : @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 which yield , respectively , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath143 .",
    "the values obtained by the same process for @xmath144 are , in order , @xmath145 , @xmath143 , @xmath141 , and @xmath141 .",
    "the four cases where the first and last terms of @xmath132 have the same sign generate only two polynomials with distinct roots , as do the cases where they have opposite signs .",
    "the complete list of quadratic factors of @xmath146 to be considered is thus @xmath147 the first has no real roots .",
    "the second has a root @xmath148 , which is less than @xmath129 ; therefore it can not be a factor , by the sign test performed earlier .",
    "neither can the last , because of the root @xmath149 .",
    "the only possible quadratic factor is thus @xmath150 .",
    "we observe that if @xmath151 , this _ is _ a factor , as can be seen from writing @xmath152 , adding one term to the other side , and taking roots .",
    "it is then easily seen that no other polynomials @xmath146 can share this factor , for if they did , the difference @xmath153 must also share the factor , which it clearly does not .",
    "this proves the lemma , and by extension the theorem .",
    "the results obtained here describe instances where the numbers in a particular  configuration \" in the triangle are the same .",
    "the most basic instance of this , the  configuration \"        was shown by singmaster [ 16 ] and lind [ 11 ] to occur infinitely many times ; in fact , precisely when @xmath34 and @xmath42 are certain expressions given by fibonacci numbers .",
    "we have shown that configurations such as     and     can occur only finitely many times , if at all .",
    "but we have _ not _ shown , for example , that     and     occur finitely many times , because in those cases the difference in @xmath42-values is equal to the difference in @xmath34-values , and the associated polynomial @xmath154 has the quadratic irrational roots @xmath155 and @xmath156 . however , the assertion that solutions are finite is still nothing more than asserting that a certain subclass of the curves studied are irreducible and have fewer than the maximum allowable number of singularities ( @xmath157 [ 7 , p. 72",
    "] , barring the possibility of non - ordinary singularities ) , something which seems very likely .    we will now analyze one of the higher - degree analogues to the curve @xmath68 in order to illustrate the validity of this idea . as we will see",
    ", the reason this is difficult in general is because of the necessity of computing a grbner basis to determine that the polynomial and its two partial derivatives share no common zeros .    in the case of the next curve with possibly infinite lattice points ( the curve with @xmath158 , @xmath159 ; defined by @xmath160 )",
    ", we may mechanically compute the grbner basis [ 13 , pp .",
    "221 , 237 ] for the system @xmath161 [ 5 , p. 19 ] to see that there are no affine singularities .",
    "if we then homogenize coordinates , and consider the system @xmath162 [ 5 , p. 19",
    "] at @xmath163 , we see that the only solution must be @xmath164=[0 : 0 : 0]$ ] , which is not a valid point [ 7 , p. 12",
    "this is because @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 are all homogeneous polynomials in @xmath26 and @xmath27 when @xmath163 . by the same argument we have used to determine @xmath87 , any homogeneous polynomial in two variables represents the union of some ( possibly complex ) lines through the origin .",
    "none of these lines are the same , and thus the only solution to this system is @xmath168 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath169 has no singularities .",
    "we may therefore apply the genus - degree formula without subtraction of additional terms : @xmath170 [ 7 , p. 72 ] .",
    "that @xmath169 is irreducible follows immediately from its being nonsingular , for by bzout s theorem [ 7 , p. 84 ] , any hypothetical components of @xmath169 must intersect somewhere in the complex projective plane , and thus create a singularity in @xmath169 . by siegel s theorem [ 7 , p. 353",
    "] , therefore , the set of lattice points is finite .    in the proposition",
    ", we have shown that if a certain configuration occurs entirely within the triangle , the smooth function giving the ratio of one binomial coefficient to the preceding one must take a value @xmath29 ( 1 plus the root of the associated polynomial ) between the  beginning \" of the configuration and the  end \" .",
    "this is essentially a precise way of stating that all the occurrences of a particular configuration have approximately the same ratio @xmath171 .",
    "the restriction @xmath172 , which was algebraically necessary to avoid dividing by zero , corresponds to requiring that the configuration is not  cut off \" by the edge of the triangle",
    ". all currently known nontrivial repetitions ( excluding singmaster s [ 16 ] ) occur so close to the side of the triangle that the proposition does not apply ; however , it is still satisfied , because the ratios on the edge are very large and change very rapidly .",
    "it is easily seen that there can not be more than @xmath2 of the  cutoff \" cases , because for each @xmath27 , there is clearly at most one @xmath26 where @xmath173 .    in the case of singmaster",
    "s infinite family , the ratio @xmath155 is always less than @xmath174 , and greater than @xmath175 .",
    "this can also be seen as a direct result of working out ratios of the given expressions involving fibonacci numbers ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "it works out that the ratios @xmath174 and @xmath175 are ratios of successive pairs of fibonacci numberssuccessive continued fraction convergents to @xmath155 . in this sense ,",
    "the coefficient repetition occurs at all the ",
    "best possible \" approximations to @xmath155 .",
    "it is tempting to think that this is somehow necessary for repetitions to occur , and then to try and disprove the existence of _ any _ other repeats  deep \" in the triangle by proving that convergents to the other , non - quadratic ratios can not occur sequentially in this way .",
    "this seems plausible because , even without invoking the more rapid continued fraction convergence properties of higher degree algebraic numbers , we have that the maximum difference between consecutive continued fraction convergents with first denominator @xmath176 is less than @xmath177 [ 6 , p. 152",
    "] , which is very often less than the difference @xmath178 between consecutive coefficient ratios . however , there is no such obvious argument for the  necessity \" of continued fraction convergence .",
    "the most obvious extension of our work would be to show that the curve defined by @xmath68 is the only one of this family of curves which passes through infinitely many lattice points , i. e. to extend the theorem to the case when @xmath179 and @xmath180 . to do that , an entirely different argument to the one used in this paper",
    "would be necessary , since we have relied on the fact that the limiting ratio of @xmath26 to @xmath27 in most cases is not quadratic . if @xmath179 , it is quadratic , and there is no apparent way to prove that nagell s [ 12 , p. 264",
    "] criterion can not be satisfied .",
    "it is possible that the symmetry of the polynomial defining the curve when @xmath179 allows a simple algebraic manipulation of the system where it and its two partial derivatives are set equal to 0 , such that an inconsistency is derived . as we have seen from the previous consideration of @xmath181 , we may work with this system , instead of @xmath162 , because the absence of singular points at infinity follows easily for all these curves .",
    "another idea would be to try and use the fact that @xmath68 is nonsingular in order to establish the non - singularity of the higher - degree curves by induction .",
    "if we designate the first large product in the equation of one of our curves as @xmath182 , and the second as @xmath183 , we may write the curve as @xmath184 .",
    "if @xmath184 is the equation of a curve with @xmath185 , then the equation of the curve with @xmath186 is @xmath187 ; in other words , when @xmath34 increases by 1 , the equation is  multiplied \" by a shifted version of @xmath188 .",
    "if this kind of  multiplication \" of two nonsingular curves could be shown to preserve non - singularity , we would have an induction argument to extend the theorem .    * * *    the conclusions we have reached here are significant in their own right : they are , to our knowledge , the first fundamental results established concerning equations of the general form @xmath1 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 vary .",
    "this is fundamentally different than considering @xmath189 and allowing , say , @xmath42 and @xmath37 to vary ( an area in which some progress in bounding and tabulating solutions has already been made [ 2 , referenced in 10 ] [ 10 ] [ 17 ] [ 4 ] ) .",
    "however , it is hardly debatable that the most ambitious and important goal in the examination of repeated coefficients is the proof of singmaster s [ 15 ] conjecture . so far",
    ", the most pointed attacks on the conjecture have resulted only in an increasingly tight series of logarithmic boundsan approach which _ a priori _ seems unlikely to yield the desired @xmath190 result .",
    "kane [ 8 ] has stated that his methodwhich initially yielded @xmath191 , and then was improved by a factor of @xmath192 [ 9]probably can not be further extended .",
    "it may be more fruitful , therefore , to cease considering @xmath7 as a function to be bounded , and instead only to try analyze when particularly high multiplicities of @xmath6 occur .",
    "we have not done this ; our concern has simply been with a certain type of nontrivial repetition .",
    "however , a large part of the value of our exploration lies in the fact that the algebraic curves we have used would seem to provide a good basis for pursuing this .",
    "notice , for instance , that a coefficient occurring six times simply corresponds to an integral intersection between two of our curves beyond a certain @xmath26-value ( the degree of the higher degree curve ) .",
    "a multiplicity of eight corresponds to three curves intersecting at the same point , and so on .",
    "furthermore , any set of the curves has at least some easily calculable number of these common intersections , because of the trivial integral points near the origin which they all share .",
    "these correspond to repetitions in the negative triangle .",
    "each large - multiplicity integral intersection between these curves also corresponds to a large integral point on a curve of much lower degree ; specifically , if @xmath193 curves with highest degree @xmath34 intersect at @xmath194 , there is an integral point on a curve of degree at most @xmath195 with greater @xmath26 and @xmath27 coordinates than @xmath196 .",
    "the singmaster [ 15 ] conjecture would be proved by bounding the number of these curves which can share a common intersection beyond a given @xmath26-value ( although this statement is stronger than is necessary ; the conjecture only considers integral intersections ) .",
    "the nave way to do this would be to take a general set of some number of these curves , shift them left sufficiently far , and try to show via nullstellensatz manipulations [ 13 , p. 22 ] ( generating other polynomials in the same ideal ) that there could not be a common intersection in the first quadrant .",
    "the difficulty , of course , lies in working generally with curves of arbitrary complexity",
    ". it should be noted , however , that because of the fact that the nullstellensatz deals with all intersections , not just integral ones , this strategy is not equivalent to simply manipulating general binomial coefficients themselves . even if the task is still seemingly difficult , we are able to utilize a more powerful tool .    _ figs . 1 - 3",
    ". several of the curves we have considered .",

    "if a general effective form of siegel s theorem [ 7 , p. 353 ] were known , it would be possible to bound the  height \" of integral points on these curves ( their coordinate size , essentially ) . however , the currently known effective methods for genus 1 curves , such as baker s [ 3 , p. 45",
    "] method , generate bounds too large ( triple exponential ) to be useful , even if they were generalized .",
