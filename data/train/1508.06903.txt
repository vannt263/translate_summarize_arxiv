    "electron - positron ( ep ) pair plasmas are ubiquitous and play important roles in many astrophysical situations such as the early universe @xcite , van allen radiation belts , and near the polar cap of fast rotating neutron stars @xcite , black holes @xcite , pulsars @xcite , quasars @xcite , active galactic nuclei @xcite , accretion disks @xcite as well as in laboratories @xcite . in black holes , pulsars and quasars such ep plasmas are emitted in the form of ultra - relativistic winds or collimated jets by some of their most energetic objects . because of the intrinsic and complete symmetry between the positively charged ( e.g. , positrons or positive ions ) and negatively charged ( e.g. , electrons or negative ions ) particles , the dynamics of pair plasmas become significantly different from that of electron - ion plasmas or from a purely electronic beam . over the last few years , a number of experiments have been performed to create ep plasmas ( see , e.g. , refs . ) . in such experiments ,",
    "it has been observed that because of the fast annihilation and the formation of positronium atoms , the identification of collective modes in ep plasmas is practically impossible . to resolve this issue and to identify the collective modes properly ,",
    "a number of experiments have been proposed to create pair - ion plasmas ( see , e.g. , ref . ) . however ,",
    "most recently , ion free high - density ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) neutral ep plasmas with unique characteristics have been produced in the laboratory by using a compact laser driven setup @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that because of their unique characteristics together with the charge neutrality , small divergence as well as high average lorentz factor , such ep plasmas can exhibit collective behaviors and thereby opening up the possibility of studying the collective dynamics of ep plasmas in a controlled laboratory environment .",
    "the collective oscillations of ep plasmas and associated wave dynamics together with the formation of solitary waves and shocks have been extensively studied over the past two decades ( see , e.g. , refs . ) . in other works ,",
    "the modulational instability ( mi ) and the nonlinear evolution of electrostatic and electromagnetic wave envelopes have also been studied in ep plasmas ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "however , most of these works are based on hydrodynamic models . using the kinetic theory approach , i.e. , using vlasov - poisson equations ,",
    "the effects of landau damping on various kinds of wave modes ( linear theory ) as well as on electrostatic and electromagnetic solitary waves [ governed by the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation ] have also been studied in ep plasmas @xcite and in some other environments ( see , e.g. refs . and references therein ) . however , to our knowledge , no theory for the explanation of electrostatic wave modulation and the effects of nonlinear landau damping on mi and nonlinear evolution have been reported in nonextensive ep plasmas .",
    "many spacecraft observations ( e.g. , in the earth s bow - shock , upper ionosphere of mars , the vicinity of the moon etc . ) @xcite and laboratory experiments @xcite confirm the presence of nonthermal and superthermal particles which do not follow the maxwellian distribution , but show some deviation from the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the presence of such nonthermal particles has also been confirmed in astrophysical environments @xcite .",
    "several models for phase - space plasma distributions with nonthermal or superthermal wings or other deviations from maxwellian distribution have been proposed in recent years .",
    "one of such distributions , which was first reported by renyi @xcite and subsequently proposed by tsallis @xcite , is the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon ( bgs ) entropy in which the degree of nonextensivity of the plasma particles is characterized by the entropic index @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution function with @xmath10 characterizes the system with more superthermal particles ( superextensivity ) , while the distribution with @xmath11 indicates plasmas containing a large number low - speed particles ( subextensivity ) compared to the maxwellian one @xmath12 . such @xmath0-nonextensive distribution has been widely considered in a number of works to investigate various collective plasma modes and nonlinear coherent structures ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "it is to be noted that the @xmath13 distribution function and the @xmath0-nonextensive distribution function in tsallis statistics are somewhat equivalent in the sense that in both these cases , the spectrum of the distribution functions show similar behaviors .",
    "in fact , there is a formal transformation @xmath14 which can provide the missing links between these two velocity distribution functions @xcite    on the other hand , it is well known that waves in plasmas can undergo collisionless damping when they resonantly interact with trapped and/or free particles , i.e. , when the particle s velocity approaches the wave phase velocity or group velocity .",
    "such collisionless damping was first theoretically predicted by landau @xcite , and later confirmed experimentally by malmberg _",
    "_ @xcite . motivated by these inventions , ott",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite first theoretically investigated the effects of linear landau damping on the nonlinear propagation of ion - acoustic solitons in electron - ion plasmas through the description of kdv equations and on the assumption that particle s trapping time is much longer than that of landau damping .",
    "later , ikezi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , based on their experimental investigation , have emphasized the importance of nonlinear landau damping in plasmas .",
    "accordingly , ichikawa @xcite investigated the the effects of nonlinear landau damping due to resonant particles having the group velocity of the wave , on the modulation of electrostatic wave envelopes in electron - ion plasmas . in this work",
    ", he assumed that the typical time scale is much longer than the bouncing period of particles trapped in the potential trough .",
    "it has been shown that the nonlinear wave - particle resonance leads to the modification of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with a nonlocal nonlinear term proportional to a cauchy principal value integral as well as the local ( cubic ) nonlinear term . furthermore , in ref .",
    "it was reported that , in contrast to the ordinary nls equation , the nonlinear resonance always leads to mi of wave envelopes against a plane wave perturbation regardless of the sign of @xmath15 positive or negative , where @xmath16 is the coefficient of the group velocity dispersion and @xmath17 is the cubic nonlinear term of the nls equation .    in this work ,",
    "our aim is to revisit and extend the work of ichikawa @xcite in an unmagnetized collisionless ep pair plasma in the context of tsallis @xmath0-nonextensive statistics . starting from a set of vlasov - poisson equations and using the reductive perturbation technique ( rpt ) , we show that the nls equation is not only modified by the nonlinear resonant effects but also by the nonextensive parameter @xmath0 which contributes to both the dispersive and nonlinear ( local and nonlocal ) terms .",
    "it is found that the nonextensivity significantly modifies the wave frequency , the group velocity , the nonlinear frequency shift and the energy transfer rate for the modulated wave packets as well as the amplitude of solitary wave solutions of the nls equation .",
    "this section mainly focuses on the derivation of the nls equation . though , the relevant analysis is almost the same as in ref .",
    ", we , however , review the analysis and present the subsequent derivations and explanations for the expressions of various plasma modes in more details .",
    "we consider the nonlinear propagation of electrostatic wave packets along the @xmath18-axis in a collisionless electron - positron pair plasma .",
    "the basic equations for the dynamics of ep plasmas are given by the following vlasov and poisson equations @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the distribution function with its unperturbed part @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the particle velocity and @xmath3 is the electrostatic potential .",
    "also , the particle charge and mass are given by @xmath24 , @xmath25 for electrons and @xmath26 , @xmath27 for positrons .",
    "we assume that the equilibrium state ( at @xmath28 ) is spatially uniform field - free ep plasma and that the perturbation from the equilibrium state is purely electrostatic .",
    "furthermore , we consider the equilibrium distribution of electrons and positrons @xmath22 to be the @xmath0-distribution function as in the tsallis nonextensive statistics @xcite . it is to be mentioned that due to the resonance of plasma particles having the group velocity of the wave , the distribution functions become singular , and so the direct application of rpt to the vlasov - poisson equations and may not determine uniquely the contributions of the resonant particles . in order to treat these singularities",
    "properly we introduce the multiple space - time scales as @xcite @xmath29 we assume that the amplitude of the carrier wave ( with wave number @xmath30 and the wave frequency @xmath31 ) is infinitesimally small , and so for @xmath32 a slight deviation @xmath33 $ ] from the uniform equilibrium value will occur .",
    "thus , we expand @xmath34 }   \\\\ & \\phi(x , t)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\epsilon^{n } \\sum_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\phi^{(n)}_l(\\eta,\\sigma,\\zeta ) \\exp{[il(kx-\\omega t ) ] } ,      \\label{expansion } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a small @xmath36 positive parameter measuring the weakness of the wave amplitude and @xmath37 , @xmath38 for reality conditions to hold . here , the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate quantity .",
    "we note that the expansion for @xmath39 is valid only in the non - resonance region where @xmath40 is satisfied . in the resonance region",
    "where @xmath41 , the above expansion may not be appropriate to apply to the vlasov equations .",
    "so , the components @xmath42 and @xmath43 are further expanded into multi - scale fourier - laplace integrals as @xmath44 \\\\ & \\phi^{(n)}_l(\\eta,\\sigma,\\zeta)= \\frac { 1}{(2\\pi)^2 } \\int_c d\\omega \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dk\\tilde{\\phi}^{(n)}_l ( k,\\omega,\\zeta ) \\exp[i(k\\eta-\\omega\\sigma ) ] , \\label{fourier - lap - int } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the contour @xmath45 is parallel to the real axis and lies above the coordinate of convergence .",
    "we first derive the evolution equation of electrostatic wave envelopes for arbitrary species of particles with unperturbed arbitrary velocity distribution function , and then we extend our analysis in neutral ep plasmas in the context of tsallis @xmath0-nonextensive statistics @xcite .",
    "so , we substitute the stretched coordinates and the expansions into eqs . and to obtain , respectively , as @xmath46 @xmath47 where we have used the symbol @xmath48 to denote the equality in the weak sense and disregarded the terms which contain @xmath49 and @xmath50 in eq . .",
    "in the subsequent analysis , we determine the contributions of the resonant particles having the wave group velocity by solving the @xmath51-evolution of the components @xmath42 and @xmath43 as an initial value problem with the initial condition @xmath52 in the multiple space - time scheme corresponding to that on the distribution function @xmath53      equating the coefficients of @xmath35 from eqs . and for @xmath55 , we obtain ( for details see appendix [ appendix1 ] ) the following linear dispersion law : @xmath56 together with the linear landau damping rate given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the cauchy principal value , and we have made the analytical continuation of the integral over @xmath23 along the real axis passing infinitesimally above and under the pole at @xmath59 with the constraint of weakly damped waves and @xmath60      from eqs . and , we equate the components for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and then use the dispersion relation to obtain the following conditions ( see appendix [ appendix2 ] ) @xmath64      here , we examine the second order terms with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "thus , we have from eq . @xmath68 while the first order terms with @xmath63 and @xmath67 of eq . yields",
    "@xmath69 substituting the fourier - laplace integrals given by eq . into eq . and solving it as an initial value problem we obtain @xmath70 where we have used an arbitrary constant as @xmath71 .    next , a substitution of eq .",
    "gives @xmath72 using the initial condition and taking fourier inversion of eqs .",
    "and we obtain for @xmath73 the following zeroth order components : @xmath74 the vanishing of @xmath75 and hence of @xmath76 in fact eliminates the contributions of the modes associated with the singularities of the integrals in eq . .",
    "thus , in this way the initial condition uniquely defines the present problem to investigate nonlinear auto modulation of @xmath77 modes .      we proceed to examine the the second order , first harmonic modes with @xmath66 and @xmath79 .",
    "thus , from eqs . and",
    "we obtain the following compatibility condition ( see for details appendix [ appendix3 ] ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 is given by @xmath82^{-1 } \\left[1 + 4\\pi\\sum e_\\alpha \\int_c\\frac{v}{(\\omega - kv)^2}g_\\alpha dv\\right ] , \\label{lambda}\\ ] ] we find that this expression of @xmath81 is exactly the same as the group velocity @xmath83 obtained by differentiating the dispersion relation with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "equation shows that the @xmath84 variation of @xmath85 can be related to a new coordinate defined by @xmath86 such that @xmath87 this indicates that the coordinate @xmath4 in eq .",
    "establishes a clear relationship between the reductive perturbation theory and the multiple space - time expansion method .      for the second order quantities with @xmath88",

    "the contributions of the resonance terms at the phase velocity @xmath92 are neglected because our basic assumption [ eq . ] for ep plasma oscillations is that the linear landau damping is a higher - order effect than second order .      from eqs .",
    "and we consider the terms corresponding to @xmath94 , @xmath67 , and use the relations and to obtain a set of reduced equations which , after use of the fourier - laplace transforms with respect to @xmath95 and @xmath51 and the initial condition , yield @xmath96 h(k,\\omega ) , \\label{ff - alpha - n2-l0-final}\\ ] ] @xmath97 where the relevant details and the expressions for @xmath98 and @xmath99 are given in appendix [ appendix5 ] .",
    "considering the terms for @xmath94 and @xmath79 , we obtain from eqs . and a set of reduced equations , which after few steps ( see appendix [ appendix6 ] ) , result into the following modified nonlinear schrdinger equation for the small but finite amplitude perturbation @xmath101 as @xmath102 the coefficients of the dispersion ( group velocity ) , cubic nonlinear ( local , nonlocal nonlinear terms , respectively , are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , given by @xmath105 and @xmath106 , where @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 with @xmath111 dv .",
    "\\label{b}\\ ] ] furthermore , the coefficient @xmath112 of eq . , representing the linear landau damping rate associated with the resonant particles having the phase velocity of the carrier wave ,",
    "is given by @xmath113 in eq .",
    ", the coefficient @xmath16 appears due to the group velocity dispersion of the wave envelope . the most significant contribution of the resonant particles having the wave group velocity is the appearance of the nonlocal nonlinear term @xmath114 .",
    "this resonance contribution also modifies the local nonlinear coefficient @xmath17 , which appears due to carrier wave self - interactions originating from the zeroth harmonic modes ( or slow modes ) .",
    "before we proceed to the modulation of electrostatic wave envelopes in @xmath0-nonextensive ep plasmas , we verify some important conservation laws that are associated with the ordinary nls equation ( here , ordinary means in absence of any nonlocal nonlinearity in the nls equation ) .",
    "we will show that the nonlocal nonlinear term in eq . violates these conservation laws .",
    "we note that in absence of the landau damping effects , i.e. , for @xmath115 , the nls equation possesses an infinite number of conservation laws .",
    "the first three conserving quantities are namely , the mass @xmath116 , the momentum @xmath117 and the energy @xmath118 .",
    "the similar quantities , however , for the nls equation with landau damping satisfy the following equations : @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 where the terms @xmath122 and @xmath104 ( the cauchy principal value integrals ) are due to the linear and nonlinear landau damping effects .",
    "next , in eq . using the fact that the integral over @xmath4 is a convolution of the functions @xmath123 $ ] and @xmath124 , where @xmath125 , and noting that the fourier inverse transform of @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 so , performing the integral over @xmath128 as a fourier transform of @xmath129 we obtain @xmath130 where ` hat ' denotes the fourier transform with respect to @xmath4 or @xmath128 .",
    "furthermore , using @xmath131 we obtain from eq .",
    "@xmath132 from this equation we observe that if the linear landau damping is a higher - order effect than @xmath133 , the term @xmath122 can be neglected , and so the the left - hand side of eq .",
    "represents the rate of change of the wave energy .",
    "also , the integral on the right - hand side is positive definite , and to be shown later that for long wavelength ep plasma oscillations , @xmath104 is always positive for @xmath134 and @xmath11 , and negative for @xmath135 .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown in ref . and will be shown in this work also that the relevant results may not be valid for @xmath135 .",
    "thus , in both the superextensive and subextensive ep plasmas we have the inequality ( the equality holds for @xmath136 ) @xmath137 implying that an initial perturbation ( e.g. , in the form a soliton ) will decay to zero with time @xmath5 , and hence a steady state solution with @xmath138 of the nls equation may not exist in presence of the nonlinear landau damping term in nonextensive ep plasmas .",
    "the nls equation in sec . [ section - nls - equation ] has been derived in a general way to describe the evolution of electrostatic waves in plasmas with arbitrary species @xmath139 and with arbitrary velocity distribution function for equilibrium plasma state . however , the main purpose of the present work is to investigate the dispersion properties of carrier wave modes , the linear landau damping rate associated with the resonant particles with the phase velocity , the modulational instability and nonlinear landau damping due to resonant particles having the group velocity as well as nonlinear evolution of wave envelopes in ep plasmas with @xmath0-nonextensive stationary states . in the latter ,",

    "it also measures the deviation from the thermal equilibrium state @xmath146 .",
    "we consider a fully symmetric and charge - neutral ep plasma in which @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "such assumptions are justified with the experimental works in pure pair plasmas with particles having the same dynamics @xcite .",
    "also , in the creation of a pure ep plasma , the whole system reaches a common thermal state with equal particle temperature .",
    "so , the spectral index for electrons and positrons are taken as the same , i.e. , @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath150 is given by @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the particle s thermal velocity and @xmath153 is defined by @xmath154 note that in the extensive limit @xmath155 , the distribution function reduces to that of the standard maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath156 .",
    "however , in the present work the case of @xmath155 may not be recovered directly because of simplifications of some expressions in the subsequent analysis , e.g. , for long - wavelength perturbations . the distribution function with @xmath10 represents the superextensivity , i.e. , presence of more ( compared to the maxwellian ) particles with velocities larger than their thermal velocities ( superthermal particles ) , whereas the case of subextensive distribution is represented by @xmath11 , meaning that there is a large number of particles with velocities lower than their thermal velocities .",
    "furthermore , because of long - range nature of coulomb forces between the plasma particles and the presence of many superthermal particles in astrophysical environments @xcite , a @xmath0-distribution with @xmath10 is strongly suggested in real plasma systems or superthermal plasmas . for more about the behaviors of the distribution function @xmath22 for different values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the readers are referred to , e.g. , ref . .",
    "in what follows , we consider the nonlinear propagation of high - frequency @xmath157 and long wavelength [ @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the debye wave number and @xmath160 is the equilibrium plasma number density ] oscillations in @xmath0-nonextensive plasmas whose phase velocity greatly exceeds the thermal velocities of electrons and positrons , i.e. , @xmath161 . in this case , the linear dispersion laws and the coefficients of the modified nls equation can be simplified . to this end",
    ", we evaluate the cauchy principal value integral in eq . with the following expansion for the integrand @xcite @xmath162 where the integration limits are taken as @xmath163 for @xmath10 and @xmath164 for @xmath11 .",
    "these limits are considered due to the fact that for @xmath11 , the distribution function has a thermal cutoff , which limits the velocity of particles to a maximum value , i.e. , @xmath165 .",
    "however , such cutoff is absent when @xmath10 . in this case",
    ", the velocity of particles remains unbounded ( for details , see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "next , to evaluate the integrals in eq .",
    "we note that the @xmath0-distribution function @xmath166 is an even function of @xmath23 , while @xmath167 is an odd function of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , one can evaluate the integrals as follows : @xmath168 we have evaluated the above integrals by parts and the average value of @xmath169 as @xmath170 we mention that for @xmath11 , the above integrals , in which the limits are @xmath171 , are obtained by reducing the integrals to beta functions of the form @xmath172 with @xmath173 and finally to gamma functions using the relation @xmath174 .",
    "similar integrals can also be evaluated for @xmath175 in which the limits are @xmath176 by using the relation @xmath177 and the above relation between beta and gamma functions . however , in each of these cases of superextensive and subextensive plasmas , we will obtain the same results by means of eq .",
    "except the factors @xmath178 for @xmath175 and @xmath179 for @xmath11 . from eq .",
    "we also note that the values of @xmath180 are further restricted to the region @xmath134 , because otherwise , the average value of @xmath169 may diverge .",
    "in particular , in the limit @xmath155 , eq . reduces to the well known energy equipartition relation @xmath181 .",
    "thus , our results may be valid for both the superextensive @xmath182 and subextensive @xmath183 distributions of electrons and positrons in plasmas .",
    "now , we use the results as in eqs . and , and in the region of small wave numbers @xmath184 to obtain from eq .",

    "however , we observe some interesting features by retaining the term @xmath190 in eq . which were overlooked in ref .",
    "these interesting features , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , are that the carrier wave dispersion curve and hence the group velocity of the wave envelope can turn over through the @xmath191-axis , going to zero values and then to negative values .",
    "these reduction of the wave frequency and the group velocity occurs in the superextensive sub - region @xmath192 . beyond this region ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath193 , both @xmath194 and @xmath81 increase with increasing values of @xmath191 .",
    "furthermore , it is observed that as one goes from the superextensive sub - regime @xmath195 to subextensive one with @xmath11 , the wave frequency and hence the group velocity are seen to get reduced .",
    "this is expected since more the superthermal particles the larger is the phase velocity , in agreement with the previous results @xcite . however , some disagreements are also there for the linear landau damping rate @xmath196 . here",
    ", we mention that though its analytic expression is the same as obtained in ref .",
    ", however , the features we observe here are quite distinct .",
    "in fact , the possibility of growing instability , as shown in ref . , can not be made in the superextensive or subextensive plasma regions . from the mathematical expression of",
    "@xmath196 one can check that it is always negative regardless of the values of @xmath0 and @xmath191 in @xmath134 ( or @xmath11 ) and @xmath197 respectively .",
    "these are clear from fig .",
    "physically , since the phase velocity of the carrier wave is assumed to be larger than the particle s velocity , the wave modes may lose energy to the particles instead of gaining energy from them , and thus be damped . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we also find that there are two subregions of @xmath191 , namely @xmath198 and @xmath199 . in the former , the damping rate increases , while in the latter the same decreases with increasing values of @xmath191 ( see the left panel ) .",
    "furthermore , the damping rate is seen to be higher in plasmas with more superthermal particles and with wavelength in @xmath200",
    ". however , the same can be true with higher the number of low - speed particles ( or with increasing values of @xmath0 ) in the regime @xmath199 .",
    "these are also clear from the right panel of fig .",
