    "white dwarf ( wd ) stars represent the final evolutionary stage of all single low - mass stars , and are thus representative of the future of the majority of stars in our galaxy .",
    "they are primarily composed of the inert by - products of hydrogen and helium fusion , and their evolution is dictated by the rate at which these carbon and oxygen ions lose their residual thermal energy @xcite .",
    "this cooling takes billions of years .    however , we can witness this cooling on human timescales by watching the wds that pulsate .",
    "these variable stars come in several classes , based on their dominant atmospheric composition ( their strong surface gravity and rapid gravitational settling leads to chemically homogenous photospheres ) . here",
    "we will restrict our discussion to the coolest class of such pulsators : the hydrogen - atmosphere dav ( or zz  ceti ) stars , found in an instability strip between @xmath2 k for standard @xmath3  = 8.0 @xcite .    aside from their variability , which is brought on by a hydrogen partial - ionization zone in the star s non - degenerate atmosphere , davs appear to be normal wds .",
    "they are therefore believed to be representative of evolution for all da wds @xcite .",
    "cooling from neutrino emission is expected to be negligible for da wds within the zz  ceti  instability strip @xcite , and their evolution should be dominated by radiative surface emission .",
    "the c / o - core davs undergo multi - periodic , non - radial @xmath4-mode pulsations with periods between roughly @xmath5 s. seismology using these @xmath4-mode pulsations has enabled us to constrain the mass , core and envelope composition , rotation rate , and the behavior of convection in these objects ( see reviews by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these modes are often stable in period and amplitude , especially for the hot davs ( hdavs ) near the blue - edge of the zz  ceti  instability strip .",
    "hdavs are expected to show an extremely slow period drift caused by the gradual cooling of the star .",
    "two of the longest - studied hdavs are g117-b15a and zz  ceti  itself ( also referred to as r548 ) , which have been observed since the early 1970s .",
    "both show considerable stability in their largest - amplitude modes .",
    "the rate of change of period with time , @xmath6 , of the dominant 215.2 s mode in g117-b15a has been measured to be @xmath7 s s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "r548 has been observed since 1970 , but more sparingly : for the 213.1 s periodicity in r548 , @xcite determine a @xmath6 = ( @xmath8 s s@xmath1 .",
    "these values have taken decades of observations , and are in line with theoretical predictions of rates of period change from cooling alone in davs of @xmath6 @xmath9 s s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "after more than nine years of monitoring , we have found evidence for an hdav that has a rate of period change inconsistent with cooling alone .",
    "the period change in the highest - amplitude periodicity for that star , sdss  j011100.63 + 001807.2  ( hereafter wd  0111 + 0018 ; @xmath4=18.7 mag ) , exceeds @xmath10 s s@xmath1",
    ". this observed rate of change of period with time is several orders of magnitude faster than predicted from cooling alone for this 11810 k wd .",
    "it therefore signifies some physical process operating on a considerably shorter timescale .",
    "in this paper we present our observations of period evolution in the four highest - amplitude periodicities present in wd  0111 + 0018 . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we outline our observations and analysis , and we reserve sections 4 and 5 for a discussion of possible explanations for this rapid period change and our conclusions .",
    "@xcite discovered pulsations in wd  0111 + 0018 , resulting from a search for variable das .",
    "the wd was initially targeted as a result of model atmosphere fits to spectra from the sloan digital sky survey : with @xmath11  = @xmath12 k and @xmath3  = @xmath13 , the object was predicted and confirmed to be a dav within the zz  ceti  instability strip .    using new treatments of line broadening theory , @xcite refined the temperature and surface gravity of wd  0111 + 0018  to @xmath11  = @xmath14 k and @xmath3  = @xmath15 , which corresponds to a mass of @xmath16 @xmath17  and a cooling age of 510 myr .    including the initial discovery observations in early 2003 , the white dwarf group at the university of texas at austin has logged a total of more than 136 hr of observations of wd  0111 + 0018  on 39 separate nights .",
    "as the journal of observations in table  [ tab : jour ] indicates , the data span more than nine years .",
    "one motivation for these observations was to use the stable pulsation modes of hdavs as precise clocks , searching for evidence of planetary companions by looking for periodic variations in the pulse arrival times @xcite .",
    "the project has also effectively opened a window on new evolutionary timescales for more than a dozen hdavs , including wd  0111 + 0018 .",

    "although the ( @xmath23 )  diagrams for wd  0111 + 0018  appear parabolic , as we would expect if the pulsations periods were changing secularly , we would also like to establish the timescale of variability if these observed trends are instead periodic in nature , since a portion of a sinusoid can mimic a parabola . for @xmath24",

    "this would enter the ( @xmath23 )  equation as @xmath59 currently , a third - order polynomial fit to the ( @xmath23 )  diagram of @xmath24  has @xmath60 ( 14 d.o.f . ) , which reduces to a value still slightly higher than that for a second - order fit .",
    "the best third - order fit would correspond to @xmath61 s s@xmath62 , with a second - order term corresponding to @xmath63 s s@xmath1 .",
    "we have also attempted a direct measurement of @xmath6 by computing a nonlinear least - squares fit to find the period for each subgroup . a best - fit line to these periods over time yields a rate of change of period with time .",
    "unfortunately , there is simply not enough data for this direct measurement .",
    "the best result comes for @xmath24 , where we determine @xmath64 s s@xmath1 , consistent with the ( @xmath23 )  value but not yet significant .",
    "the other independent parent mode in wd  0111 + 0018 , @xmath25 , shows a much slower period change than @xmath24 .",
    "still , it is significantly faster than predicted by cooling theory , with a best - fit parabola that corresponds to @xmath65 s s@xmath1 ( or @xmath66 ms yr@xmath1 ) . in this case , a second - order fit is only marginally better than a linear fit : the best - fit parabola has @xmath67 ( 15 d.o.f . ) , whereas the best - fit straight line has @xmath68 ( 16 d.o.f . ) .",
    "noise can cause scatter about a straight line in an ( @xmath23 )  diagram , especially over a relatively short baseline ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since a bad period can cause a dominant linear term , we caution that the rate of change of the @xmath25  periodicity may still be somewhat slower than the value cited in table  [ tab : freq ] if the period we use for our ( @xmath23 )  diagrams is off by as little as 0.06 ms .",
    "therefore , we recommend that our value be construed as an upper limit on the rate of change of period with time of @xmath25 . as with the other parent mode",
    ", we also investigated the best periodic rather than secular fit , and found a sinusoid with a 9540 year period and 3051490 s ( @xmath23 )  amplitude , with a @xmath67 ( 15 d.o.f . ) .",
    "( if such a trend were from an external companion , it would require a 10.8 @xmath17  unseen companion at 401 au . )",
    "a monte carlo simulation of the uncertainties using the software package period04 @xcite indicates that our formal least - squares uncertainties on the phases used to construct the ( @xmath23 )  diagrams are underestimated by at most 10% .",
    "thus , the scatter about our residuals ( evident by the large @xmath69 quoted above for the second - order fits , e.g. @xmath70 for @xmath24 ) may not be entirely the result of underestimated uncertainties .",
    "the deviation about the residuals is consistent with the observed scatter in other long - studied davs , such as g117-b15a ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we have investigated the stability of the four highest - amplitude periodicities in wd  0111 + 0018  by plotting the amplitudes of each determined by a linear least - squares fit to each subgroup , using the periods in table  [ tab : freq ] .",
    "this result is shown in figure  [ fig : amps ] .",
    "it is meaningful since all observations were obtained and reduced in an identical manner .",
    "we have also marked the weighted mean amplitude for each mode with dotted lines .",
    "there are considerable deviations about this mean compared to the formal uncertainties , such that only the periodicity at @xmath26  has a constant amplitude in a statistically meaningful way .",
    "while the amplitudes of the @xmath24  and @xmath25  modes do not appear constant over our entire data set , the deviations from the mean do not appear coherent , and can not explain the large - scale parabolic changes we observe in observed times - of - maxima .",
    "finally , in line with the original intentions of this data set , we have investigated whether periodic changes in the times of maxima can explain the scatter observed about the residuals after subtracting the dominant parabolic terms .",
    "this scatter might reveal the presence of an unseen companion .",
    "however , a fourier transform of all four ( @xmath23 )  residuals , after subtracting the dominant parabolic terms identified in figure  [ fig : omc ] , show no peaks above twice the mean noise level of 1.5 s. we can thus conservatively rule out the presence of any companion more massive than jupiter at a current orbit between @xmath71 au ; the scatter is predominantly incoherent and can not currently be attributed to an unseen companion .",
    "before focusing on the rapid rates of period change , we first draw attention to the observation that @xmath6 for the @xmath26  and @xmath27  combination frequencies evolve exactly in lockstep with their parent modes . for example , we expect the @xmath26  combination frequency to have half the rate of change of period with time of its parent mode , since @xmath26  has half the period .",
    "we expect @xmath72 s s@xmath1 and in fact observe @xmath73 s s@xmath1 , in excellent agreement .",
    "the @xmath27  combination frequency is a bit more complicated , given it is a sum of the parent frequencies and not an integer ratio .",
    "we expect its rate of change of period with time to be @xmath74 where @xmath75 @xmath24@xmath1 , @xmath76 @xmath25@xmath1 , and @xmath77 ( @xmath27)@xmath1 .",
    "we thus expect a rate of @xmath78 s s@xmath1 and in fact observe @xmath79 s s@xmath1 .",
    "as with @xmath26 , our observed rates match the predictions exactly within the errors .",
    "this lends convincing evidence that these nonlinear combination frequencies are not independent modes themselves , but rather artifacts of some nonlinear distortion in the outer layers of the star .",
    "they are thus directly tied to the parent modes , and evolve at exactly the same rate as these parent modes .",
    "this is an important result that convincingly demonstrates the nonlinear nature of these signals .",
    "in fact , an extensive theory explaining the creation of nonlinear combination frequencies in davs was introduced by @xcite .",
    "he attributed the nonlinearities to the changing thickness of the star s convection zone , which acts to distort a linear input signal . physically , local surface temperature variations lead to changes in the depth of the convection zone , which both absorb and release energy .",
    "because this process is so sensitive to temperature ( @xmath80 for a dav ; @xcite ) , these variations in the depth of the convection zone lead to nonlinear effects in the observed light curve .",
    "an alternate explanation that may play a role for the hottest davs is given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they invoke the nonlinear response of the flux observed in a passband to the temperature ( i.e. , the `` @xmath81 '' nonlinearity ) .",
    "regardless of the source of these nonlinearities , our result confirms that the phase evolution of these combination frequencies mirrors that of their parent modes .",
    "these combination frequencies are thus directly tied to their parent modes .",
    "the presence of nonlinear combination frequencies may also be useful in identifying the spherical degree ( @xmath82 ) and azimuthal order ( @xmath83 ) of the parent modes . in an investigation of eight davs",
    ", @xcite found that the amplitudes of combination frequencies are too large to be created by the @xmath81 nonlinearity , and are probably due to the higher - order temperature dependence of the convection zone .",
    "they employed the formalism of @xcite , who derived an analytical expression for the amplitudes of the combination frequencies in the context of the brickhill framework of a depth - varying convection zone . using the ratio of the amplitudes of the parent and combination frequencies , yeates et al .  derived constraints on the @xmath82 and @xmath83 value of the parent mode .    with the same goal in mind ,",
    "we have used our own code to automatically search for combinations of @xmath82 and @xmath83 that best fit the observed amplitudes in wd  0111 + 0018 .",
    "this code uses a genetic algorithm to efficiently sample parameter space ; see  4.1 of @xcite for more details .",
    "we run this algorithm 1000 times so that we obtain 1000 estimates of the best - fit parameters .",
    "the method of @xcite is only applicable to second - order combinations , i.e. , @xmath26  or @xmath27 but not @xmath84 .",
    "even with just three independent combination amplitudes we are able to find constraints .",
    "consistently , we best reproduce the observed amplitude ratios ( we have used the amplitudes of the 2009 - 2012 group , provided in section  [ sec : ft ] ) when we allow the @xmath24  parent mode at 292.9 s to be an @xmath85 , @xmath86 mode .",
    "we also find the @xmath25  parent mode at 255.7 s to be an @xmath87 , @xmath88 mode .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : modeamps ] , where we plot the distribution of the top 7% of fits with the lowest @xmath89 , interpreting this as a probability distribution for the identifications .",
    "in addition , we have implemented the convective nonlinear light curve fitting code of @xcite and @xcite to generate a synthetic light curve based on the parent modes in wd  0111 + 0018 .",
    "this method investigates the time - averaged thermal response time of the convection zone , @xmath90 , which relates to the mass and depth of the convection zone . in principle",
    ", it should be superior to the perturbative method of @xcite in that it makes use of all higher - order amplitudes and their phases .",
    "these nonlinear fits produce estimates for the @xmath82 and @xmath83 values of the parent modes , the time - averaged convective timescale @xmath91 , the temperature sensitivity exponent @xmath92 , and the inclination of the pulsation axis to our line of sight @xmath93 .",
    "fitting our light curves from the 2011b subgroup , we find an identical match to our previous method .",
    "the 292.9 s mode is best represented by an @xmath85 , @xmath86 mode and the @xmath25  parent mode at 255.7 s best fits as an @xmath87 , @xmath94 mode .",
    "additionally , these fits find @xmath95 s , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "we thus adopt an interpretation that @xmath24  is an @xmath98 dipole ( @xmath99 ) mode and @xmath25  is a quadropole ( @xmath100 ) mode .",
    "the constraints on the azimuthal order of @xmath25  are less conclusive .",
    "we will use this information to help constrain our asteroseismic models , which will in turn inform our attempts at understanding the observed @xmath6 .",
    "we can immediately rule out the possibility that an unseen external body is vigorously tugging wd  0111 + 0018  away from our line of sight , causing a light - travel time effect that is manifest as the increasing delay in pulse arrival times : rapid space motion would affect all modes identically , and the periodic modulation in the mode @xmath25  is more than an order of magnitude slower than that of @xmath24 , as we found in section  [ sec : rates ] .",
    "we must be observing a phenomenon internal to the wd .",
    "we expect cooling to be the dominant evolutionary effect of an isolated dav , and this cooling timescale should have a direct effect on the period evolution of modes in a pulsating wd . to first order ,",
    "as a wd cools it becomes more degenerate .",
    "this causes a decrease in the square of the brunt - visl  frequency , @xmath101 .",
    "the brunt - visl  frequency is essentially the oscillatory frequency of an adiabatic fluid displacement in a convectively stable medium . in the limit of low temperature and complete degeneracy , where pressure does not depend on temperature",
    ", a displaced fluid element would remain in pressure and density equilibrium with its surroundings .",
    "it would stay put and thus have zero oscillatory motion  and thus a zero @xmath101 .",
    "thus , @xmath101 decreases with increasing degeneracy , and therefore decreasing temperature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the period of a @xmath4-mode pulsation is inversely proportional to the brunt - visl  frequency @xcite .",
    "therefore , cooling will cause a secular increase in a pulsation period with time , which can be estimated from the cooling timescale predicted from mestel theory , as well as full evolutionary models . predicted rates of period change for davs undergoing simple cooling are of order 10@xmath102 s s@xmath1 ; we find observational evidence to support this timescale from observations of g117-b15a and r548 @xcite .",
    "the 215.2 s mode in g117-b15a and the 213.1 s mode in r548 are most likely either an @xmath103 mode or a @xmath104 mode , depending on the adopted hydrogen layer mass @xcite .",
    "we note that the work of monitoring long - term phase evolution of davs requires a mode coherent in amplitude and phase .",
    "this is usually not the case for the cooler davs , which evidence strong amplitude modulation and a corresponding lack of stability in phase ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one cool dav has , for at least a brief time , shown enough phase coherence to create a meaningful ( @xmath23 )  diagram : the 615.2 s mode in g29 - 38 @xcite , which showed a coherent but extremely rapid phase change , more than 200 s over less than three months of monitoring in 1988 @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence that the 274.8 s mode in r548 has a @xmath105 s s@xmath1 @xcite , and that the 270.5 s and 304.1 modes in g117-b15a have @xmath106 s s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "still , most modes in davs observed to date simply do not show enough coherence to create stable ( @xmath23 )  diagrams .",
    "wd stars with heavier cores should cool faster than those that are lighter .",
    "indeed , spectral fits show that wd  0111 + 0018 , at @xmath107 @xmath17 , is slightly more massive than g117-b15a and r548 , which are between 0.590.60 @xmath17 .",
    "still , even a 1.4 @xmath17  fe - core wd would have a @xmath6 from cooling of less than @xmath108 s s@xmath1 if the wd has @xmath11",
    "@xmath109 k @xcite .",
    "our observed rate of change of period with time for @xmath24  in wd  0111 + 0018  exceeds 10@xmath0 s s@xmath1 , more than two orders of magnitude faster than predicted from cooling alone .",
    "it is also more than an order of magnitude faster than expected from an avoided crossing @xcite or by invoking excess cooling from exotic particles such as axions @xcite .",
    "we thus interpret this discovery as evidence of an additional physical timescale acting on the evolution of the pulsation periods in wd  0111 + 0018 .",
    "both the 292.9 s and 255.7 s modes of wd  0111 + 0018  likely probe different regions of the star , so mode identification ( specifically the radial order , @xmath110 ) would yield further insight into understanding these anomalous rates of period change .",
    "unfortunately , asteroseismology is made more difficult by the presence of just two independent modes ; there are far more free parameters than observations .",
    "still , we have attempted to match the observed periods to adiabatic pulsation models with some assumptions and the constraints provided by our spectroscopic mass and temperature determinations .",
    "our two best matches to the observed periods have the following properties :    solution 1 : @xmath24  is an @xmath99 , @xmath111 mode ( @xmath98 occurs at 293.4 s ) , while @xmath25  is an @xmath100 , @xmath112 mode ( @xmath98 occurs at 255.0 s ) .",
    "this wd model has a stellar mass of 0.710 @xmath17 , an effective temperature @xmath113 k , a he envelope mass of @xmath114 , and a h envelope mass of @xmath115 .",
    "solution 2 : @xmath24  is an @xmath100 , @xmath116 mode ( @xmath98 occurs at 293.7 s ) , while @xmath25  is an @xmath100 , @xmath112 mode ( @xmath98 occurs at 255.0 s ) .",
    "this wd model has a stellar mass of 0.720 @xmath17 , an effective temperature @xmath117 k , a he envelope mass of @xmath118 , and a h envelope mass of @xmath115 .",
    "additionally , we can use our spectroscopic constraints to explore the models of @xcite of a 0.705 @xmath17 , @xmath119 k wd with a thick ( @xmath120 @xmath121 ) hydrogen layer mass .",
    "similarly , we find that the 292.9 s mode is either an @xmath122 or @xmath123 mode .",
    "the 255.7 s mode is either an @xmath124 or @xmath125 mode .",
    "we caution that because these solutions are consistent does not imply they are correct  our assumptions may not indeed be valid .",
    "but these solutions will help inform our analysis of what could be causing the rapid period change in wd  0111 + 0018 .",
    "using our spherical degree ( @xmath82 ) identifications described in section  [ sec : combs ] , we can break the degeneracy in @xmath24  and suggest that the 292.9 s periodicity represents an @xmath123 mode , while the the 255.7 s periodicity is an @xmath124 mode . in order to visualize how each such mode samples the star , we have included a propagation diagram in figure  [ fig : propdiag ] .",
    "we have marked where a @xmath126250 s and a @xmath126300 s @xmath4-mode for different @xmath82 values would probe the star ( where @xmath127 ) .",
    "however , an even more informative display of how each mode could probe the star differently can be found in figure  [ fig : wtfxn ] .",
    "here we plot , as a function of the `` normalized buoyancy radius '' ( see @xcite ) , the weight functions for @xmath101 ( see equation 8c of @xcite ) for our best identifications of the modes in wd  0111 + 0018 .",
    "the weight function essentially shows where in the star an excited pulsation is most resonant ; it shows the sensitivity of a mode s period to changes in the equilibrium model .    immediately evident from this exercise",
    "is that the majority of the energy of the 292.9 s mode , @xmath24 , is located in the he layer or the region of the he - h transition .",
    "conversely , nearly all the energy of the 255.7 s mode , @xmath25 , is resonant much deeper in the star , inside the c / o - he transition .",
    "this suggests that the 255.7 s mode energy is predominantly resonant inside the core , while the 292.9 s mode samples significantly more of the surface layers of the star",
    ". the 255.7 s mode would therefore be much less sensitive to changes in the outer regions of the wd .",
    "given the insensitivity of the 255.7 s mode to changes in the outer layer of the star , one possibility for the new timescale represented by the fast rate of change of period with time in wd  0111 + 0018  involves a change in the surface layers of the star at a rate much faster than from cooling alone but much slower than the timescales associated with the pulsations themselves .",
    "for instance , the depth of the convection zone of the wd could change gradually , perhaps as a result of a change in the global magnetic field of the wd .",
    "we have seen evidence for rapid changes in the pulsation profile of wds in the past : especially notable is the so - called `` sforzando '' event seen in gd 358 in 1996 , in which this dbv changed from a highly multi - periodic pulsation spectrum to a higher - amplitude , monoperiodic pulse shape , indicating a rapid thinning of the convection zone during this event @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the plausibility of this scenario by comparing two slightly different theoretical models .",
    "both model wds have identical masses ( 0.71 @xmath17 ) , effective temperatures ( 11810 k ) , and chemical profiles .",
    "however , we have changed the efficiency of convection by varying the mixing length parameter : in our initial model we use ml2/@xmath128=1.23 and in the other we use ml2/@xmath128=1.12 .",
    "this effectively , albeit superficially , causes the second model to have a slightly thinner convection zone .",
    "we take the difference of the periods computed by the first model with the periods from the second to estimate the effect these changes would have on different modes .",
    "we find that even the shortest period @xmath103 pulsations would change in mode period by more than 1 ms from one model to the next .",
    "this result can reproduce the observed rates of period change in wd  0111 + 0018  if the timescale of this change in the depth of the convection zone acts on the order a few decades .",
    "one way to perturb the overall depth of the convection zone is to introduce a gradual change in the global magnetic field strength .",
    "in fact , increasing the global magnetic field from 0 g to 1 kg would effectively change the depth of the convection zone by the same amount as changing the convective efficiency from ml2/@xmath128=1.23 to ml2/@xmath128=1.12 ( montgomery & vishniac , in preparation ) .",
    "it is possible then that the rapid period change we observe in wd  0111 + 0018  could be related to a secular ( or long - term periodic ) change in the strength of the magnetic field in the star .",
    "if this is indeed a byproduct of a stellar cycle , we might expect our heretofore secular increase to at some point turn over or in fact become discontinuous when the magnetic cycle changes course .",
    "future observations of wd  0111 + 0018  will help constrain this hypothesis .",
    "another mechanism that could affect one mode differently than another , in the way we see in wd  0111 + 0018 , is a changing rotation rate .",
    "rotation will act to break spherical symmetry , splitting non - radial pulsations into ( @xmath129 ) azimuthal components that would normally be degenerate with the @xmath98 component @xcite .",
    "however , if the rotation rate were somehow to change ( a spin - up or spin - down ) , only the @xmath130 components would be affected .",
    "if @xmath24  is an @xmath131 mode and @xmath25  is an @xmath98 mode , a changing rotation rate could explain the large difference in rates of period change between the two .",
    "our observed rate of change of period with time for @xmath24  would require the rotation of the wd to change at a rate @xmath132@xmath133 s yr@xmath1 .",
    "such a rapid change would require a tremendous reservoir of angular momentum to redistribute , and some place to deposit this energy .",
    "this appears especially unlikely given the observational result that the hot pulsating white dwarf pg1159 - 035 rotates as a solid body through more than 97.5% of its mass , indicating that wds have very little angular momentum , even at @xmath11  @xmath134 k @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we do not observe any other multiplet components for @xmath24  or @xmath25 , making it difficult to definitively rule out this rotational effect component of a rotationally split multiplet and not the @xmath98 central component .",
    "this is well illustrated for different @xmath82,@xmath83 values in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that only one component of a multiplet is excited . ] .",
    "but our results from the convective light curve fitting discussed in section  [ sec : combs ] did yield predictions for the @xmath83 value of each mode : @xmath86 for @xmath24  and @xmath88 for @xmath25 .",
    "this contradicts the values needed to invoke a changing rotation rate to explain the different rates of period change between these modes .",
    "some additional effects intrinsic to the star that could cause phase variations include linear interference ( such as beating of closely spaced modes ) , nonlinear interactions with other modes ( such as mode coupling ) and a precession of the rotation axis with our line of sight @xcite .",
    "each of these cases would simultaneously affect the amplitude of a given mode .",
    "since we do not see evidence of the amplitudes evolving identically with the phase ( comparing figure  [ fig : omc ] with figure  [ fig : amps ] ) , none of these are likely responsible for the inferred high rates of period change in wd  0111 + 0018 .",
    "as part of a search for substellar companions to isolated wds , we have discovered a dav , wd  0111 + 0018 , with an unexpectedly fast rate of change of period with time .",
    "we see this anomalously high rate reflected in not only the highest - amplitude mode in the star at 292.9 s but also the two nonlinear combination frequencies that sample this parent mode .",
    "all three periodicities are changing at a rate faster than 10@xmath0 s s@xmath1 , more than two orders of magnitude more quickly than expected from cooling alone in a dav .    the pulsation period of the other parent mode at 255.7 s is increasing at a rate at least an order of magnitude more slowly , which allows us to rule out an extrinsic source of this rapid period change .",
    "instead we are likely observing a physical phenomena intrinsic to the star acting on a timescale we have not yet observed in a dav .",
    "this discovery indicates that our understanding of the expected rates of period change for the slow and simply evolving davs is far from complete .",
    "it also complicates , in a macroscopic sense , our ability to infer the contributions of exotic weakly interacting particles such as axions to anomalies in the rate of change of period with time of davs .",
    "we have attempted to use the nonlinear combination frequencies present in this star as probes of the spherical degree of the two parent modes .",
    "using convective light curve fitting @xcite , we find that the 292.9 s mode is best represented as an @xmath85 , @xmath86 mode and that the @xmath25  parent mode at 255.7 s best fits as an @xmath87 , @xmath94 mode .",
    "this identification , if confirmed , would rule out a changing rotation rate as the explanation of the rapid period change in the 292.9 s mode .",
    "guided by the spherical degrees we identify by this convective light curve fitting we have found a best - fit asteroseismic model , which is admittedly poorly constrained .",
    "still , this exercise suggests that @xmath24  is an @xmath135 mode and @xmath25  is an @xmath136 mode .",
    "we construct a weight function , and show that this solution for @xmath25  is almost entirely resonant inside the core , and is thus much less sensitive than @xmath24  to changes in the outer regions of the wd .",
    "we discuss a scenario where a gradual thinning of the convection zone could be responsible for the rapid rates of period change observed in this dav .",
    "this thinning could be caused by increasing the global magnetic field by less than 1 kg over a decade .",
    "such a hypothesis is hard to test empirically , although if this magnetic field change is related to a stellar magnetic activity cycle , we would expect an eventual turnover or discontinuity in the observed ( @xmath23 )  diagram .",
    "independent of the cause of this unexpected period change , we have for the first time shown that the evolution of nonlinear combination frequencies in a dav matches the evolution of their parent modes .",
    "this behavior confirms that these combination frequencies are not independent pulsation modes but rather artifacts from some nonlinear distortion occurring in the star .",
