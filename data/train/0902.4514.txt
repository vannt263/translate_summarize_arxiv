    ", voting is greatly manipulatable by the organizers , as it is the case with the participants whose `` ideals '' are the points in the multidimensional space of programs [ 2 ] ( see also [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the monograph [ 4 ] is devoted to the spatial voting models .",
    "the problems of relations between selfishness , altruism , and rationality were considered in [ 57 ] , and voting as a method of making decisions about redistribution of social benefits by means of taxation and social programs was discussed in [ 811 ] .    for a stochastic environment oriented to the analysis of `` effectiveness '' of the voters collectivist and selfish attitudes in the conditions where new programs are randomly generated by the `` environment , '' rather than developed by the organizers or participants of voting , a model of voting",
    "was suggested by the present author and analyzed in [ 12 ] .",
    "consideration was given to the case of neutral environment , the rest of the cases being analyzed mostly in qualitative terms .",
    "emphasis was made on the time dependencies of the participant `` capitals '' under various values of the model parameters . in what follows",
    ", the present author obtained explicit expressions of these dependencies , the exact formulas of expectations and their normal approximations . these formulas",
    "enable one to determine the nature of social dynamics under any values of the model parameters .",
    "expressions for the expectations of the capital increments were obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec_main ] , the necessary lemmas being proved in sec .  [ sec_lem ] .",
    "we give a thumbnail of the simplest variant of the model .",
    "the `` society '' is assumed to consist of @xmath0 `` participants '' of which @xmath1 are `` egoists '' and @xmath2 are the `` group '' members . at any time instant ,",
    "the participant is characterized by its `` capital '' expressed by a real number and interpreted in the most general sense ( like _ utility _ ) .",
    "each participant has some starting capital .",
    "the `` environment proposal '' is the vector @xmath3 of the algebraic increments of the capitals of all participants .",
    "these increments are independent - in - aggregate random variables with identical distribution @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the model parameters . at each step",
    ", one random `` environment proposal '' is put to the vote .",
    "each `` egoist '' votes `` for '' if and only if the proposal brings it a positive capital increment .",
    "each member of the group votes `` for '' if and only if the group gains from the realization of this proposal .",
    "the `` gain '' may be understood differently .",
    "the basic model considers two fundamental principles of decision voting .",
    "* principle a*. _ the group votes `` for '' the proposal @xmath7 if and only if as the result of its approval the number of group members getting a positive capital increment exceeds that of the group members getting a negative increment . _    * principle b*. _ the group votes `` for '' the proposal @xmath7 if and only if the sum of increments of group members is positive@xmath8 @xmath9 , where the sum is taken over the subscripts of the group participants .",
    "_    the results of voting are summarized using the `` @xmath10-majority '' procedure : the proposal is accepted if and only if more than @xmath11,@xmath12 , participants vote for it . if the proposal is accepted , then the capitals of all participants get the corresponding increments @xmath13 , or remain the same , otherwise .",
    "capital dynamics of the participants is analyzed in terms of their social roles ( `` egoist '' or `` group member '' ) and model parameters .",
    "it is implied , in particular , that a scenario is plausible where the egoists join the group and the `` group egoism '' resembles more and more the decision making in the interests of the entire society . by another hypothetical scenario ,",
    "an `` ineffective '' group dissolves , and its members either become `` egoists '' or make other groups .",
    "it is planned also to consider the case of a socially oriented group supporting its poorest members and preventing their ruin , a variant of the model where the capital increments depend on their current values , the impact on the social dynamics of the mechanisms of taxation and collection of the `` party dues , '' and so on . at the same time",
    ", it is not planned to consider purely economical mechanisms of capital reproduction and loss because our aim lies in analyzing the social , rather than the economic phenomena .",
    "consideration is given not only to the traditional decision threshold @xmath14 corresponding to the `` simple majority , '' but to all thresholds ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "that is due to the fact that the most important  for example , `` constitutional''decisions are accepted by the a `` qualified parliamentary majority '' with a threshold greater than @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "there are `` initiative '' decisions such as forming new deputy groups in parliament , putting question on agenda , sending requests to other state authorities , initiating referendums , and so on which can be approved by a certain number of votes smaller than one half .",
    "this model is discussed in more detail in [ 12 ] .",
    "the relation between the numbers of egoists and group members is defined by the parameter @xmath18 , half of the portion of egoists among all participants .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , the one - dimensional density and the cumulative distribution function corresponding to the distribution @xmath4;@xmath21 and @xmath22 stand for density and the distribution function of the normal distribution with center at @xmath15 and variance @xmath16 ;  @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the expectation and the deviation of any of the random variable @xmath25 at hand .",
    "each @xmath26th egoist participant votes for a proposal if and only if @xmath27 . the probability of this event is as follows : @xmath28 the probability of voting `` against '' the proposal is as follows : @xmath29 in what follows , we also need the notation @xmath30    according to the model , the probability that a participant abstains from voting is zero because the normal distribution is continuous .",
    "therefore , the voting of an egoist participant is the bernoulli test with the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "then , since the values @xmath32 are independent , the number of egoists voting `` for '' is distributed _ binomially _ with the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath31 .",
    "the mean value and the variance of this distribution are , respectively , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "in this section we prove lemmas that underlie the following calculations . by the `` _ normal voting sample _ '' of size @xmath1 with the parameters @xmath35 and voting threshold @xmath36 is meant the totality of random variables @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a sample from the distribution @xmath4 , @xmath39 and @xmath40    the following lemma holds .",
    "[ l1 ] let @xmath41 be a normal voting sample with the parameters @xmath35 and the voting threshold @xmath36 .",

    "the proofs are given in the appendix .",
    "to calculate ( [ mvot ] ) , one may use the well - known relation between the binomial distribution and the beta - distribution : @xmath46 the right - hand side contains the cumulative function of the distribution of beta - distribution with @xmath47 and @xmath48 degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the normal approximation of the binomial probability can be used even for a comparatively small @xmath1 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the same parameters as for the binomial distribution : @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "summation in ( [ appro0 ] ) provides an approximation to the binomial distribution function : @xmath54    the normal approximation is advisable for @xmath55 . for a fixed @xmath34 ,",
    "its accuracy is maximal for @xmath56 and decreases with @xmath31 approaching @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the normal approximation is often recommendable for @xmath57 already if @xmath58 . for the values of @xmath31 that are very close to @xmath15 or @xmath16 ,",
    "usually the condition @xmath59 is imposed .",
    "[ l2 ] let @xmath41 be a normal voting sample with the parameters @xmath35 and the voting threshold @xmath36 .",

    "this approximation is equivalent to the replacement of a finite number of the participants of voting by a continuous `` voting field . ''",
