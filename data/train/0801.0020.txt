    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) that happened at the zero temperature is purely a phenomenon of ground state ( gs ) transition driven by external parameters .",
    "traditionally , qpts are described in terms of order parameter and symmetry breaking within the landau - ginzburg paradigm which have been extensively studied in condensed matter physics @xcite . in recent years",
    ", qpt has also attracted a lot of attention in quantum - information science @xcite , in which one of the research focus is the role of quantum entanglement in characterizing qpts @xcite .",
    "more recently , another concept in quantum information science , i.e. , the fidelity has been put forward to identify qpts from the perspective of the gs wave functions @xcite .",
    "the gs fidelity is defined as the overlap between two ground states with only slightly different values of the external parameters @xcite and thus is a pure geometrical quantity . since no a priori knowledge of the order parameter is needed , the fidelity might be a potential universal criteria for characterizing the qpts @xcite .",
    "an increasing interest has been drawn in the role of gs fidelity in detecting qpts for various many - body systems @xcite , since zanardi and paunkovic first exploited it to identify qpts in the xy spin chain @xcite where the fidelity shows a narrow drop at the transition point . remarkably , the success of fidelity analysis in dealing with the bose - hubbard model @xcite and spin systems @xcite implies that it may have practical relevance even for more complicate strongly interacting systems where no a simple description is possible .",
    "the relation between the fidelity and berry phase @xcite has also been unveiled in terms of riemannian metric tensors @xcite .",
    "generally one may expect that the gs fidelity shows an abrupt drop in the vicinity of the qpt point of the system as a consequence of the dramatic change of the structure of the gs .",
    "this is true for the first - order qpts caused by a level crossing of gss due to the gs wavefunctions at the different sides of the level - crossing point are almost orthogonal ( orthogonal at the level - crossing point ) .",
    "however , this is neither an obvious nor a general conclusion for a continuous qpt where no gs level crossing occurs and the gs evolves  adiabatically \" in the parameter space @xcite .",
    "conventionally , qpts are characterized by singularities of the ground state energy : first - order qpts are characterized by discontinuities in the first derivative of the energy , whereas second - order ( @xmath0th - order ) qpts are characterized by discontinuities in the second ( @xmath0th ) derivative of the energy .",
    "an important question is whether the singularity of gs energy is intrinsically related to the gs overlap ?",
    "answering this question is no doubt significant for a deeper understanding of qpts , and the validity and limitation of fidelity as a measure of qpts .",
    "so far the studies of fidelity as a measure of qpts are based on the analysis of particular many - body models @xcite .",
    "the general connection between gs fidelity and qpts is not yet well established . in this work",
    ", we shall discuss , in a general framework , how the gs fidelity can be related to a qpt characterized by non - analyticities of the gs energy .",
    "our result shows that the singularity and scaling behaviors of the gs fidelity ( or it derivatives ) are directly related to its correspondences of the derivative of gs energy .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we reveal the general relation between the fidelity susceptibility and the 2nd order derivative of the gs energy .",
    "the subsequent sections are devoted to two examples which exhibit the 2nd order and kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) qpts , respectively .",
    "a summary is given in the last section .",
    "the general hamiltonian of a quantum many - body system undergoing qpts reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is supposed to be the driving term with @xmath3 the control parameter . in terms of the eigenstates @xmath4 of @xmath5",
    ", the hamiltonian can be reformulated as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is dimensions of the hilbert space .",
    "the gs fidelity is defined as the overlap between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the gs wavefunction corresponding to the parameter @xmath3 and @xmath12 is a small quantity @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the fidelity is dependent of @xmath12 .",
    "the rate of change of fidelity is given by the second derivative of fidelity@xcite or fidelity susceptibility ( fs ) @xcite @xmath13 which is @xmath12 independent and sometimes a more effective quantity to detect the qpt .",
    "first we discuss the first order qpt ( @xmath14qpt ) which is induced by gs level crossing .",
    "we assume @xmath15 @xmath16 for @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the crossing point where the gs energy level @xmath19 crosses over the first excited level @xmath20 , therefore we must have @xmath21 for @xmath22 explicitly , for the @xmath14qpt , the gs energy is defined as @xmath23 the derivative of the gs energy is defined as @xmath24 in general , @xmath25 is not equal to @xmath26 therefore the first derivative of gs energy for a @xmath14qpt is not continuous at the transition point . accordingly , the gs fidelity at the transition point is defined as @xmath27 therefore we have @xmath28 which means that there appears a sharp drop in the transition point .",
    "it is straightforward that the sudden drop in the transition point shares the same physical origin with the discontinuity of the first derivative of gs energy .",
    "next we consider the continuous phase transition for which the gs of the hamiltonian is nondegenerate for a finite system .",
    "for the case of @xmath29 order qpt , there is no level crossing for the gs energy , therefore we can always represent @xmath30 .",
    "the first derivative of the gs energy is given by @xmath31 which is noting else but the hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "it is straightforward to get the second derivative of gs energy @xmath32 inserting the identity operator @xmath33 between @xmath2 and @xmath34 , we then get @xmath35 with @xmath36 we note that the term of @xmath37 is not included in the summation because it gives zero due to @xmath38 differentiating the eigenequation @xmath39 with respect to @xmath40 and taking the inner product with @xmath41 yields @xmath42 exploiting the hermiticity of @xmath43 to write @xmath44 it follows that for @xmath45 @xmath46 therefore , we have @xmath47 to see the relation of fs with the second derivative of gs energy , we rederive the expression of fs @xcite by expanding the wavefunction @xmath48 in the basis of eigenstates corresponding to the parameter @xmath3 , to the first order , which leads to @xmath49 where @xmath50 ^ 2}$ ] is the normalization constant .",
    "it follows directly @xmath51 substituting it back into eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) , we get @xmath52 ^2}.   \\label{fsr}\\ ] ]    comparing eqs .",
    "( [ fsr ] ) and ( [ 2de ] ) , we find that for both of them the singularities come from the vanishing energy gap in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , a divergence does not necessarily occur in the critical point , for example , for the kt qpt as we shall discuss later , no singularity arises even the energy gap tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit as matrix elements @xmath53 may also vanish simultaneously . despite the apparent similarity between eqs .",
    "( [ fsr ] ) and ( [ 2de ] ) , we note that fidelity susceptibility can not be expressed by the gs energy 2nd derivatives alone @xcite . nevertheless , the different power in the denominators in eqs .",
    "( [ fsr ] ) and ( [ 2de ] ) shows that fidelity susceptibility might be a more sensitive tool to detect critical points because it can be more singular than the second derivative of gs energy .",
    "therefore , for the case where the gs energy 2nd derivative is divergent at the critical point , it is no doubt that the fidelity susceptibility is divergent too .",
    "however , for the case where the second derivative of gs energy is not divergent , ( for example the 3rd - order qpts and the kt phase transition ) , it is hard to judge whether the fidelity susceptibility becomes singular or not at these critical points just from the relation between eqs .",
    "( [ fsr ] ) and ( [ 2de ] ) .",
    "to understand the equivalence of the two approaches in characterizing the quantum criticality , we first apply them to study a specific example , say , the transverse field ising model with the hamiltonian given by @xmath54 where @xmath3 represents external magnetic field along the @xmath55 axis and the periodic boundary is assumed .",
    "following the standard procedure @xcite , the model can be diagonalized by applying jordan - wigner transformation which maps the spin model to a fermion model and then using the bogoliubov transformation @xmath56 .",
    "the result is given by @xmath57 with @xmath58 where the summation is over @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 with the assumption of @xmath62 the ground state of @xmath43 is the vacuum @xmath63 of @xmath64 given by @xmath65 with the ground state energy @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are , respectively , the vacuum and single excitation of the @xmath69th mode @xmath70 and @xmath71 is defined by @xmath72 it follows that the fidelity is given by @xmath73 with @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "after some very simple algebras , one get @xmath75 in the thermodynamic limit with @xmath76 , the summation can be replaced by the integral and thus we get @xmath77 ^{3/2 } } d\\varphi\\ ] ] and @xmath78 ^2 } d\\varphi\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "both of the above integrals are divergent when @xmath81 .",
    "their singular behavior can be analyzed in the vicinity of critical point @xmath82 with the asymptotic behavior described by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .     as a function of @xmath3.,width=316 ]",
    "to get further insight on how the two approaches work , we study both the scaling behaviors of fs and second derivative of gs energy . as shown in fig . 1",
    ", we display the second derivatives of gs energy for different lattice sizes . despite no real divergence for finite @xmath85 ,",
    "it is obvious that the curves exhibit marked anomalies with height of peak increasing with the lattice size .",
    "the parameter @xmath86 labelling the position of peak approaches the critical point @xmath82 in a way of @xmath87 .",
    "the value of peak diverges logarithmically with increasing lattice size as @xmath88 . by proper scaling scheme",
    ", we can fit all the data of @xmath89 $ ] as a function of @xmath90 for different @xmath85 into a single curve as displayed in the inset of fig .",
    "correspondingly , the fs exhibits similar scaling behaviors as shown in fig .",
    "2 . around the critical point ,",
    "all the data for different @xmath85 collapse into a single curve of @xmath91 $ ] as a function of @xmath90 . a related quantity has been used in @xcite to make scaling analysis for the quantum ising model .",
    "it is clear that @xmath92 and @xmath93 exhibit similar critical behavior around the critical point .",
    "having demonstrated the equivalent role of the two different approaches in identifying qpt on the transverse ising model , we now use this procedure to understand the more elusive kt - type qpt for which , contrary to the previous expectation , the gs fidelity and the fs turn out to be insensitive to qpt in some cases , for example , in the spin @xmath95 model @xcite .",
    "we now consider the @xmath94 model which provides a further test for the intrinsic relationship between the derivatives of gs energy and fs .",
    "the model is defined by @xmath96 with @xmath3 the exchange anisotropy parameter and it is related to @xmath97 by a unitary transformation .",
    "it is well known that the model is in a critical phase for @xmath98 , an antiferromagnetic phase at @xmath99 , and ferromagnetic phase at @xmath100 the qpt at the ferromagnetic isotropic point @xmath81 is a 1qpt caused by the level crossing of gs .",
    "here we shall focus on the qpt at the antiferromagnetic isotropic point @xmath101 which is known to be of kt type . in the whole parameter regime",
    "the model is integrable .",
    "the eigenstate of @xmath5 has the form of @xmath102 with the coefficients having the bethe - ansatz form @xcite @xmath103\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is any permutation of @xmath105 and the phase @xmath106}{\\cos [ ( p+q)/2]-\\lambda \\cos [ ( p - q)/2]}\\right ) $ ] .",
    "the eigenenergies @xmath107 are determined by a set of quasi - momentum @xmath108 ( @xmath109 for @xmath61 down spins which are the solution of bethe ansatz equations ( baes ) @xmath110 , where @xmath111 are integer or half - odd integer .",
    "model as a function of @xmath112 .",
    "the data labelled by @xmath113 and @xmath114 are obtained by ed and they comply with the data by bethe - ansatz method exactly.,width=345 ]    by numerically solving the baes , we can get the gs state energy for different sizes of @xmath85 . as shown in fig.3",
    ", we calculate the @xmath115nd derivative of gs energy by both bethe - ansatz and exact diagonaliztion ( ed ) methods and the fs by ed .",
    "our numerical results show that there is no any singularity around the critical point @xmath116 for both the fs and @xmath115nd order derivative of gs energy for different sizes . for the gs energy derivatives ,",
    "this is true even in the thermodynamic limit where actually , as proven in @xcite , all the @xmath0th order derivatives of gs energy are continuous .",
    "thus , in view of its connection to the derivatives of gs energy , we can understand why the gs fidelity failed to reproduce quantum critical behavior by the desired singularities in the critical point for the kt transition .",
    "it is also natural to explain why the finite size scaling of fs has a clear distinction between noncritical and critical phases because the gs energies are known to fulfil quite different finite size scaling in critical or noncritical phase @xcite .",
    "the gs energy in the critical regime fulfills the finite - size correction @xmath117 with @xmath118 being the conformal anomaly number and @xmath119 the `` sound velocity '' for the model @xcite . here",
    "@xmath120 is defined by @xmath121 . on the other hand ,",
    "the conformal invariance is broken for @xmath122 and the gs energy fulfills a different finite size scaling @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind that the equivalent role of fs and derivative of gs energy , we expect that the fs exhibits similar scaling behavior in the critical regime as its counterpart of derivative of gs energy does and there is a deviation from the scaling behavior when @xmath122 .",
    "indeed , the fs has been shown to scale differently in critical and noncritical phases based on the results by ed method @xcite .",
    "this feature can be used as an indicator of kt qpt occurring in this model . before ending the discussion",
    ", we would like to give a remark to the problem whether the fidelity approach is suitable to detect the kt transition ? as no rigorous result of the fs even for the exactly solvable model is available in the thermodynamic limit , therefore this question is still in a doubtful status @xcite and remains an open problem .",
    "we have shown the intrinsic relationship of the fidelity and derivatives of gs energy and revealed their equivalent role in identifying the qpts . within our framework",
    ", the singularities and scaling behavior of fidelity for various systems can be well understood on general grounds . through concrete examples",
    ", we display that divergence of the fs or derivatives of gs energy can be applied to identify the 2nd order qpt , whereas for the kt transition the criticality is not a sufficient condition to ensure divergence of the fs or derivatives of gs energy .",
