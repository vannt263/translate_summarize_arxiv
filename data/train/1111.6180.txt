    "in high energy neutrino experiments , neutrinos from pion decays are used .",
    "neutrino flux is not directly measurable and is estimated from a pion s flux and decay probabilities .",
    "now precision measurements are becoming possible in neutrino experiments and a precise value of the flux is required .",
    "so it is important to verify a standard assumption and to find a precise value .",
    "we point out that a correction due to a quantum mechanical interference of a single neutrino is necessary in the flux in near detector regions .",
    "decay amplitudes and probabilities are obtained normally with a standard method of s - matrix using plane waves .",
    "an asymptotic boundary condition @xcite is assumed and an average decay rate is found and used for estimations of the flux .",
    "this method gives precise values of fluxes of final states in the asymptotic space - time region where a particle has no correlation and is described with a plane wave .",
    "it has never been clarified , however , if particles in the final state are observed in an asymptotic region . it would be reasonable to assume that a boundary between an asymptotic and non - asymptotic regions is of microscopic size , since transitions of weak decays occur in short distance regions .",
    "however we find that is not the case .",
    "an asymptotic region for a neutrino in a particle decay is located in a macroscopically distant area from an initial particle s position .",
    "waves produced at different positions accumulate at a detector and make experiments in the inside of this area unusual .",
    "superposition of waves causes an interference effect in a form of a diffraction in a parallel direction to the momentum , which makes the plain waves non - asymptotic .",
    "various relations satisfied for the asymptotic states , such as a unitarity , an energy momentum conservation , and others are modified with the diffraction term .    to study the interference phenomenon of particles produced in a decay , it is convenient to study a coherence length from a behavior of a correlation function defined with a wave function",
    ". let @xmath0 be a wave function of a final state composed of one particular particle at a space - time position @xmath1 and others , @xmath2 .",
    "an amplitude of observing this particle at a momentum @xmath3 and a position @xmath4 using a detector is defined with the wave function at one space - time position @xmath1 and a wave packet @xmath5 in the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a wave packet with which this particle interacts and a gaussian form with a size @xmath8 and velocity @xmath9 is used for the sake of simplicity , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is scalar product of a four dimensional coordinate @xmath1 and momentum @xmath3 and @xmath12 is a normalization factor .",
    "since the wave packet vanishes at @xmath13 , it satisfies the asymptotic boundary condition .",
    "so the wave packet is approapriate to study a finite size correction .",
    "an integral of the product @xmath14 is the probability @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 stands for the volume element of state @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath15 is written as @xmath18 using the correlation function defined with @xmath19 the correlation function generally has the singular function @xmath20 or regular functions @xmath21 where a finite @xmath22 is determined from dynamics of the system .",
    "if one momentum that is conjugate to @xmath23 is integrated and the singular function @xmath24 is derived , this gives the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is given in the form @xmath27 in a high energy region , @xmath28 .",
    "other oscillating or decreasing terms give constants to @xmath29 .",
    "so @xmath26 stands for a coherence length of the wave function .",
    "the coherence lengths of a pion and an electron of an energy of @xmath30 [ gev ] are @xmath31= 2\\times 10^{-14}\\ , [ \\text{m}],\\\\ & & l_0^{electron}={2 \\hbar c \\over 0.5 ^ 2}\\,[\\text{gev}^{-1}]\\approx   10^{-10}\\ , [ \\text{m}],\\label{electron - coherence}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and those of other hadrons are shorter than that of a pion .",
    "so charged leptons and hadrons have short coherence lengths of microscopic sizes in an ordinary high energy region .",
    "neutrinos are exceptional and lighter than an electron by @xmath32 or more and have coherence lengths , @xmath33 ,   \\label{neutrino - coherence}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a macroscopic size . from eqs.@xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "the non - asymptotic region is narrow in charged leptons and very wide in neutrinos .    in outside of the coherence length @xmath36 ,",
    "the wave - like correlation vanishes .",
    "hence the state behaves like a particle - like object which has no spatial correlation and satisfies the asymptotic condition . in inside ,",
    "@xmath37 , on the other hand , the probability varies with @xmath38 and a wave - like correlation remains .",
    "so the physical state behaves like an unusual wave that is distinct from a particle - like object .",
    "the physical state is not treated as a real particle and does not satisfy the asymptotic condition .",
    "so the coherence length is used as the boundary between the asymptotic and non - asymptotic regions .",
    "transition probabilities in the asymptotic region are studied using an ordinary s - matrix and a decay amplitude of plane waves and hold relations of a standard s - matrix . but those in the non - asymptotic region are peculiar and different from those of particle natures of a standard s - matrix .",
    "they violate some relations and are not studied with a standard s - matrix of plane waves .",
    "the physics in both regions can be studied with a time dependent schredinger equation or a scattering amplitude of wave packets , which satisfy the asymptotic conditions and have manifest position dependence .",
    "we study the physics in the non - asymptotic region using the position dependent amplitudes .",
    "charged leptons are massive and their measurements are made in their asymptotic regions .",
    "so physical quantities are computed with the ordinary s - matrix and agree with values obtained in experiments .",
    "weak decays of mesons are understood well with @xmath39 weak interactions through measurements of the charged leptons .",
    "for neutrinos the situation is different . since the asymptotic region",
    "is located in a distant area , neutrinos may be observed in non - asymptotic regions .",
    "then the neutrino reveals wave - like phenomena such as interference or diffraction and has an unusual position dependence .",
    "a diffraction term , in fact , emerges and gives a finite contribution to the neutrino flux .",
    "a new term which does not satisfy varios relations of the standard s - matrix is added to an amplitude in a short distance region .",
    "the total neutrino s flux thus obtained deviates from that obtained using the naive decay probability and has an excess .",
    "implications of the diffraction term to the total cross sections @xcite are studied .",
    "a diffraction term @xcite is derived from a position - dependent amplitude of a pion decay process .",
    "the amplitude is determined in the first order of the @xmath39 weak hamiltonian @xmath40 in the form , @xmath41 , here a pion is prepared at a time @xmath42 , and a neutrino is measured with a wave packet of a space - time position @xmath43 and a charged lepton is un - measured .",
    "the neutrino wave packet @xcite expresses a target nucleon which the neutrino interacts with .",
    "hence the wave packet is well localized in the coordinate variable . to represent this property ,",
    "the momentum variables must cover whole momentum region and the gaussian form is used in this work .",
    "a set of wave packets of a @xmath44 with a continius spectrum of momentum and coordinate is complete @xcite .",
    "hence neutrinos are described with wave packets of central values of the momentum and coordinate and a width @xcite .",
    "other particles are described with the plane waves .",
    "they are expressed in the form @xmath45 is written with the hadronic @xmath39 current and dirac spinors in the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and the time @xmath48 is integrated in the region @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is a neutrino wave packet size and is estimated using a nucleus size .",
    "the gaussian form of the wave packet is used for a sake of simplicity but the most important result is unchanged in general wave packets as was verified in @xcite .",
    "if the coordinate @xmath51 is integrated in eq.@xmath52 , the delta function @xmath53 emerges .",
    "so @xmath54 is integrated easily and the gaussian part becomes @xmath55 .",
    "the exponent has two stationary momenta , @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "hence the probability gets a contribution from a lepton around the former momentum , which is called a normal term , and another contribution from it of broad spectrum around the latter momentum , which is called a diffraction term .",
    "the transition probability to this final state is finite and an order of integrations are interchangeable .",
    "so the probability is written , after the spin summations are made , with a correlation function and the neutrino wave function in the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 is a normalization volume for the initial pion , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 in eq.@xmath65 , the momentum , @xmath66 , is integrated in whole positive energy region .",
    "@xmath67 is composed of a light - cone singularity @xcite and regular terms . the former is generated from those plane waves that have a same phase and are added constructively . in order to extract a leading singular term in the variable , @xmath68 , we write the integral in a four dimensional form with a new variable @xmath69 that is conjugate to @xmath70",
    ". then @xmath71 is decomposed into integrals in @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "the integrand of @xmath77 is expanded in @xmath78 and the integration leads the light - cone singularity @xcite , @xmath79 , and less singular and regular terms which are described with bessel functions . an integral from the region @xmath73 , @xmath80 , is written with the momentum @xmath81 and has no singularity .",

    "@xmath89 has a singularity of the form @xmath103 around @xmath104 and decrease as @xmath105 or oscillates as @xmath106 at a large @xmath107 .",
    "the series in eq.@xmath108 converges when @xmath109 and this expression is valid in this kinematical region .",
    "the singular terms , @xmath24 and others , in eq.@xmath108 decrease slowly with the distance and give a correlation effect in a wide area .",
    "these terms are derived from the integration in @xmath110 .",
    "because this region is outside of kinematical region of satisfying the energy and momentum conservation @xmath111 , its contribution disappears in the amplitude defined at @xmath112 .",
    "conversely the singular terms are included only in the physical quantities observed at a finite time interval .",
    "so they are not derived from the standard calculations of plane waves with the asymptotic conditions .",
    "the latter term , @xmath80 , on the other hand , comes from the integration region @xmath113 , which is in the kinematical region of satisfying the energy and momentum conservation .",
    "so this determines the quantities at @xmath112 .",
    "this term oscillates or decreases fast in @xmath114 with a time scale determined with ordinary microscopic quantities and becomes microscopically short , as most other cases .",
    "we will see that the light - cone singularity is combined with the small neutrino mass and gives a finite distance correction of an exceptional scale to the position dependent neutrino flux .",
    "next , eq.@xmath108 is substituted to eq.@xmath115 and the coordinates @xmath116 and @xmath117 are integrated .",
    "the most singular term , @xmath118 , is from @xmath119 in @xmath120 , which has no scale , and is rewritten using the center coordinate @xmath121 and the relative coordinate @xmath122 .",
    "the center coordinate @xmath123 is integrated easily and @xmath118 becomes an integral of the relative coordinates @xmath124 .",
    "finally we have @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the phase @xmath128 of eq.@xmath115 becomes the small phase @xmath129 of eq.@xmath130 at the light cone due to a cancellation between the time and space components.the angular velocity of @xmath131 is extremely small and the interference is not determined with de broglie phase but this small phase .",
    "this leads an unusual neutrino interference of the present work .",
    "the next singular term is from @xmath132 in @xmath120 , and becomes @xmath133 , which is much smaller than @xmath134 in the present parameter region .",
    "the magnitude is inversely proportional to @xmath135 and is independent from the @xmath136 for the general form of wave packet also .    integrating @xmath137 and @xmath138 in a finite @xmath139",
    ", we have a slowly decreasing term @xmath140 and a normal term @xmath141 .",
    "@xmath142 is generated from the light - cone singularity and related term .",
    "@xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the normal term , @xmath146 , is from the rest . due to the rapid oscillation in @xmath147 , @xmath141 gets contribution from the microscopic @xmath147 region and is constant in a macroscopic t. this term does not depend on @xmath148 and agrees with the normal probability obtained with the standard method of using plane waves . in the region",
    "@xmath149 , @xmath67 does not have the light - cone singularity and the diffraction term exists only in the kinematical region @xmath150 .",
    "we compute a total probability next . from an integration of neutrino s",
    "coordinates @xmath151 , the total volume @xmath60 is obtained and cancelled with the normalization of the initial pion state . the total probability ,",

    "the diffraction term vanishes and the probability @xmath157 agrees with the value of the standard calculation of plane waves . at a finite t , the probability has the diffraction component , @xmath140 , which is stable under variation of the pion s energy .",
    "now we study each term of eq.@xmath158 . in the normal term , @xmath141 ,",
    "the energy and momentum are conserved well , and @xmath141 has a sharp peak at @xmath159 . hence the factor @xmath160 in eq.@xmath158 becomes @xmath161 and a cosine of angle between @xmath162 and @xmath163 is determined uniquely by the relation , @xmath164 and the probability is proportional to @xmath161 .",
    "integration of the neutrino s angle leads this integral independent of the angle width , as far as it include the narrow peak .",
    "the value is independent also of @xmath44 , which is consistent with the condition for the stationary state @xcite .",
    "the diffraction component , @xmath140 , on the other hand , is present in a kinematical region , @xmath165 .",
    "the energy and momentum are not exactly conserved in the space - time dependent amplitude eq.@xmath52 .",
    "hence @xmath166 in eq.@xmath158 is larger than @xmath161 , and the cosine of angle between @xmath162 and @xmath163 is not uniquely determined .",
    "the dependence of the diffraction term upon the angle between @xmath167 and @xmath168 is presented in fig.[fig : angle - energy ] for @xmath169[gev ] .",
    "the angle , which is determined uniquely from the neutrino energy for the small wave packet , is not unique and is widely spread . from this behavior of the diffraction component",
    ", it might have been possible to reject the diffraction component and to take only the normal component in narrow band beam experiments if the neutrino s interaction position were observed .",
    "comparison of the total cross section of satisfying this constraint with that of non - constraint events might have given direct signals of the diffraction component .",
    "the diffraction term is slowly varying with both the distance and energy .",
    "the typical length @xmath170 of this universal behavior is @xmath171 = { 2e_{\\nu } \\hbar c / m_{\\nu}^2 } = 400\\times { e_{\\nu}[\\text{gev}]/   m_{\\nu}^2[\\text{ev}^2/c^4]}$ ] .",
    "its magnitude was found to be about 10 - 20 %  of the normal term in a suitable experimental situation and depends on geometry of the detector . in this paper",
    "we analyze total neutrino nucleon cross section , which is connected with the neutrino flux and its high energy behavior is understood well from a standard quark parton model .",
    "a probability of observing a neutrino or a charged lepton in the pion decay at a position of a macroscopic distance is written in the form @xcite , @xmath172 in eq.@xmath173 , @xmath174 is the normal term that is obtained from the decay probability @xmath141 in eq.@xmath158 and @xmath175 is the diffraction term that is determined from @xmath176 in eq.@xmath158 .",
    "the latter has not been included in calculating the total cross sections before and its effect is estimated here .    the diffraction term at a time @xmath177 is described by its mass and energy in the universal form @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a constant and is obtained later .",
    "@xmath180 are small in neutrinos and large in charged leptons .",
    "@xmath181 is positive definite and decreases slowly with a distance @xmath182 , and vanishes at the infinite distance with the length scale @xmath183 .",
    "this scale is macroscopic for neutrinos but is @xmath184[m ] or less for the electron and muon .",

    "it is striking that the neutrino flux has an additional term and is not equivalent to that of the charged lepton even though they are produced in the same decay process .",
    "this diffraction term is generated by the tiny neutrino mass and the interference term generated with the superposed waves of forming the light - cone singularity .",
    "because @xmath192 is the interference term , it has unusual properties different from those of @xmath174 in the neutrino flavour and the energy and momentum .",
    "the neutrino diffraction furthermore is sensitive to the absolute neutrino mass .",
    "we study implications of the diffraction term to total cross sections , next .",
    "a total cross section of a neutrino nucleon scattering is written in the form , @xmath194 using integrals of quark - parton distribution functions @xmath195 and @xmath196 , @xmath197 .",
    "the cross sectin is proportional to the neutrino energy and a current value is @xmath198 $ ] @xcite .",
    "so experiments seem consistent with eq.@xmath199",
    ". however recent experiments of nomad @xcite and minos @xcite gave the total cross sections in wide energy ranges with small uncertainties and showed that the cross sections have slight energy dependences .",
    "they are compared with our theoretical calculations in the following .",
    "the diffraction term was identified only recently . here",
    "we include the diffraction term into the neutrino flux .",
    "the neutrino flux in pion decays is given as a sum of the normal and diffraction terms in the form @xmath200 where @xmath201 is a ratio of the diffraction component over the normal component , and is a function of @xmath202 , @xmath203 where the coefficient @xmath204 is determined from geometry .",
    "when the detector is located at an end of a decay volume , the correction factor eq.@xmath205 is used . in an actual experiment ,",
    "the detector is located in a distant region from a decay volume .",
    "there is soil between them and pions are stopped in a beam dump . the neutrino diffraction does not occur and neutrino propagates freely in this region .",
    "since the wave packets of one @xmath148 form a complete set , the wave packet size at the decay volume is the @xmath148 determined with the detector .",
    "the neutrino flux at the end of the decay volume is computed with the diffraction term of the decay volume s length @xmath206 and the wave packet size of the detector .",
    "wave packets of this @xmath148 propagate freely from the end of a decay volume to the detector .",
    "the final value of the neutrino flux at the detector is found using the factor eq.@xmath205 .",
    "when a neutrino changes flavour in this period , the final probability for each flavour is written with a standard formula of flavour oscillation .",
    "a true value of the total cross section , @xmath207 , obtained with the total flux is connected with a cross section , @xmath208 , obtained with only the normal component of the flux by the ratio @xmath209 conversely the experimental cross section is written as @xmath210 @xmath211 is believed a constant so the e - dependence of @xmath212 is due to the e - dependence of @xmath213 , eq.@xmath205 .",

    "we found that an plane wave approximation which was employed in this paper was very good .",
    "the cross sections decrease quite slowly with the neutrino energy , which may be difficult to understand with the standard theory .",
    "the theoretical cross sections obtained by including the diffraction component into the neutrino flux showed the same behavior and agreed well with the experiments .",
    "two experiments are actually different in the neutrino energy and geometry , but agreed with the theory . so the large cross sections at low energy regions may be attributed to the diffraction component .",
    "we have compared only nomad and minos here .",
    "many experiments are listed in particle data @xcite and most of them have similar energy dependences and agree qualitatively with the diffraction s presence .",
    "it is important to notice that the magnitude of diffraction component is sensitive to geometry and if a kinematical constraint eq.(@xmath226 ) on the angle between @xmath227 and @xmath228 was required , only the events of the normal term was selected .",
