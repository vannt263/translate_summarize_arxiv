    "deterministic photon - photon phase gate is a key building block to construct circuits for the scalable all - optical quantum information processing .",
    "cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) between slow pulses in media under electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) conditions @xcite ( or with similar properties ) is the main route towards such a gate .",
    "considerable theoretical developments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) as well as experimental studies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have been undertaken to explore the eit - based xpm and alternative approaches aiming at realizing photonic two - qubit gates .    in optics - based quantum computing , a conditional phase of @xmath0 radians needs to be implemented by photon - photon phase gates .",
    "for achieving such a large phase there are the proposals @xcite of making pulses co - propagate , so that the generic weak pulse interaction could be compensated by the prolonged interaction time .",
    "another requirement for an ideal phase gate is the uniformness of conditional phase , as given by the mapping @xmath1 , i.e. , the same phase @xmath2 is induced for each mode @xmath3 of a continuous - mode photon in the state @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the pulse profile in wave - vector space .",
    "the currently dominant understanding is that a homogeneous phase could be possible if the interaction between two pulses is averaged out by letting one pulse completely go through the other @xcite .",
    "since a photon is not a point particle , photon - photon interactions in nonlinear media should be modeled as interacting quantum fields of continuous modes . using this picture ,",
    "we show that the above - mentioned notions are generally invalid .",
    "the essential effects in realistic single - photon xpm are clarified here for the first time .",
    "we first provide a theoretical framework for the xpm between photons . the interaction between two pulses in a medium of any type of atomic structure realizing eit can be translated into that between two dark - state polariton fields @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) with @xmath8=\\delta_{i , j}\\delta(k - k')$ ] @xcite . by neglecting the pulse loss and deformation , as well as the possible self - phase modulation term which has no effect on photon - photon interactions @xcite",
    ", one has the following equations of motion for the slowly varying and transversely well confined polariton fields @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the pulse group velocities .",
    "the term @xmath11 could come from a general interaction potential @xmath12 .",
    "the pulse interaction in the experimentally studied xpm thus far @xcite , for instance , can be modeled by a contact potential @xmath13 , where @xmath14 approximated by a real quantity is the nonlinear rate determined by the specific system parameters .",
    "the potential @xmath12 considered here acts instantaneously ; see @xcite for a study on the non - instantaneous effects . from the field - theoretic viewpoint ,",
    "( [ motion ] ) is obtained by the equation of motion @xmath15 for non - relativistic fields , where the hamiltonian @xmath16 consists of the kinetic term @xmath17 and the interaction term @xmath18 .",
    "the pulse interaction would evolve the input state to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 denotes the time - ordering operation and @xmath22 is adopted hereafter ) .",
    "it is convenient to use the _ two - particle function _ , @xmath23 , to study the evolution of the initial state @xmath24 . to indicate how close a realistic xpm is to the ideal one @xmath1 for phase gates",
    ", we use the _ fidelity _ @xmath25 . as figures of merit to characterize a realistic xpm , the fidelity @xmath25 and conditional phase @xmath2 are determined by the overlap @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the two - particle function from the field operator equations @xmath28 , corresponding to the freely evolved state @xmath29 .",
    "a similar formula in the discrete form is given in @xcite .",
    "the output state of a realistic xpm , @xmath30 , is generally entangled between the wave - vector modes @xmath3 and @xmath31 of the individual photons .",
    "such field modes entanglement was widely neglected in the previous researches on photon - photon gates , though its effect on xpm was conjectured in @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that the entanglement would lower the fidelity @xmath25 . yet , for clarifying the issue , a relation between the amount of entanglement generated in pulse interaction and the corresponding gate operation fidelity has to be found .",
    "here we quantify the field mode entanglement with the linear entropy @xmath32 ( @xmath33 are the reduced density matrices of the bipartite state @xmath34 ) , which takes the following closed form : @xmath35 see appendix for the proof . compared with the schmidt decomposition method to characterize bi - photon entanglement @xcite , this formula provides an exact measure of such entanglement .    in reality",
    "the medium for pulse interaction carries a finite bandwidth @xmath36 , which is connected to the width of eit transparency window @xcite .",
    "hence , the equal - time commutator for the field operator @xmath37 after being imposed a cut - off by the bound of the wave - vector mode @xmath38 becomes @xmath39&=&\\delta_{ij}(k_s/\\pi ) \\mbox{sinc}\\big ( k_s(z_1-z_2)\\big)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & \\delta_{ij}c(z_1-z_2 ) ,   \\label{com}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 .",
    "substituting the formal solution of ( [ motion ] ) , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 originates from the contact potential @xmath43 , into @xmath44 , while considering the commutator in ( [ com ] ) , yields the general two - particle function @xmath45 at the time @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 . the second term on the right side of eq .",

    "the norm of the two - particle function @xmath49 is not preserved as a consequence of the deviation of the field operator commutator @xmath50 from the delta function @xmath51 , so the output two - photon function @xmath49 has to be normalized prior to calculating the fidelity and linear entropy using eqs .",
    "( [ over - lap ] ) and ( [ entropy ] ) .",
    "the system bandwidth @xmath36 effectively results in a non - unitary evolution , though the wave - vector modes @xmath3 , @xmath31 of two photons are still continuous after imposing the cut - off @xmath52 .",

    "( [ c - phase ] ) may become zero or negative with increasing @xmath76 , and it is universal with respect to any pulse shape . as @xmath73 decreases or increases across this point , the gate performance characterized by the achievable @xmath2 values will undergo a transition to the different pattern . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the conditional phase @xmath2 can never assume values greater than @xmath78 no matter how large @xmath76 is .    without loss of generality , in our discussion below we consider the interaction between two identical pulses in the gaussian profile @xmath79 .",

    "( [ 2-p - e ] ) carry the same variable @xmath88 , thus deviating from the ideal output two - particle function @xmath89 in the neighborhood of @xmath84 .",
    "the xpm between two evenly distributed square pulses shows the same characteristics except for the different relations between the @xmath90 and @xmath72 values , indicating that the effects described above differ , by nature , from the inhomogeneity in pulse interactions .    an interesting observation from fig .",
    "2 is the feature that , around the transitional point @xmath80 of the two operation patterns , the plots of @xmath81 , e.g. , the thin solid line , reaches the highest value at some @xmath91 .",
    "increasing @xmath76 beyond the point leads to a continual distortion of the two - photon state without increasing its entanglement .",
    "irrespective of the pulse shapes , the linear entropy plateau at the transitional point is correlated to the fidelity valley like that in fig .",
    "3 , which goes down to @xmath92 at @xmath80 and @xmath93 .    furthermore",
    ", we comment on the notion that pulses moving with matched group velocities make large conditional phase possible @xcite . in the previous theoretical studies , the variables @xmath94 and @xmath95 of the two - particle function in ( [ 2-p - e ] ) were often mixed up with the pulse - center coordinates , and then the phase @xmath76 would be regarded as the conditional phase @xmath2 for the reason that the overlapped pulse centers with @xmath96 could lead to the ideal output @xmath97 from eq .",
    "( [ 2-p - e ] ) .",
    "in fact , the variable @xmath98 of the @xmath99 function in ( [ 2-p - e ] ) assumes any value even if the two pulses co - propagate , because @xmath100 are the field coordinates over the whole @xmath101 axis rather than those of the pulse centers .",
    "the conditional phase @xmath2 should be determined by eq .",
    "( [ over - lap ] ) giving its relation with the xpm phase @xmath76 in fig .",
    "1 . the conditional phase value could reach @xmath0 in the upper regime of fig .",
    "1 , where the gate operation fidelity is , however , rather low .",
    "a high fidelity is possible only in the lowest region in fig .",
    "1 , where the state evolution is close to unitary but the peak of the conditional phase @xmath2 is vanishing . the vanishing conditional phase in the regime of near unitary evolution also exists in case of interaction between co - propagating single photon and coherent state ; see @xcite .",
    "the trade - off between conditional phase and fidelity in xpm between co - propagating photons is also discussed recently in @xcite , where a finite mode approximation for pulses is adopted .",
    "one problem with the finite mode approximation is its underestimation of xpm intensity  compared with the contribution from the second term in our eq .",
    "( [ 2-p - e ] ) , the term arising from xpm , the discrete sum with the corresponding term in @xcite ( the second term in eq .",
    "( 22 ) of @xcite ) contributes much less significantly to a coefficient similar to @xmath73 in this paper , limiting its value to less than @xmath102 .",
    "then only the lower regime in our fig .",
    "1 can be obtained in the finite mode approach . for two ultraslow pulses the small ratio @xmath103 in the parameter",
    "@xmath72 makes the upper regime in fig . 1 more relevant .",
    "the effect of non - unitary evolution of quantum states dominating in this regime is beyond the description by the finite mode approximation .",
    "next we examine the xpm between pulses colliding head - on @xcite via a contact potential @xmath43 . for two ultraslow pulses satisfying @xmath104 , there is the approximation @xmath105 in ( [ 2-p ] ) , so the infinite sum in eq .",
    "( [ 2-p ] ) can be approximated by a closed form in this regime . substituting the normalized two - particle function into ( [ over - lap ] ) , we obtain the fidelity evolution in the course of pulse interaction ; see the example in fig .",
    "it shows that the fidelity value will decline once a pulse touches the other and stabilize again after they pass through each other .",
    "the stronger the interaction ( indicated by the @xmath76 values ) is , the lower the fidelity will become after collision . against the intuitive notion that an averaged interaction on pulses could generate a uniform conditional phase @xmath2 , a realistic xpm between pulses of a non - zero relative velocity can be far away from the ideal process @xmath1 .",
    "an ideal performance of phase gates based on the xpm described above exists in the limit of an infinite system bandwidth @xmath36 . in this limit",
    "the two - particle function after two pulses completely going through each other is @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is a fixed value from the contact potential @xmath43 .",
    "this result is also true to the xpm between single photon and coherent state @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent two - particle functions for such idealized unitary evolution under a general interaction potential @xmath12 take the form @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the field mode entanglement exhibited by the possibly non - factorisable @xmath109 with respect to its spatial variables is therefore the main factor that determines the gate operation fidelity in a regime of approximately unitary evolution , which could be realized under the condition @xmath110 .",
    "we have illustrated the effects of continuous field mode entanglement arising from pulse interaction and non - unitary evolution caused by finite system bandwidth , which drastically impair photon - photon phase gate performance .",
    "these effects induce more complexity in xpm than what was previously understood . due to their possible existence in any device working with quantum objects of continuous degrees of freedom , the proper handling of the effects could be a major concern in quantum technology .",
    "we provide a brief derivation for the linear entropy formula in eq .",
