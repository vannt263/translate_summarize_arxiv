    "born as a theoretical background for thermodynamics , statistical mechanics provides nowadays a flexible approach to several scientific problems whose depth and wideness increases continuously .",
    "in fact , in the last decades statistical mechanics has invaded fields as diverse as spin glasses @xcite , neural networks @xcite , protein folding @xcite , immunological memory @xcite , social networks @xcite , theoretical economy @xcite and urban planning @xcite . as a consequence , an always increasing need for models and proper techniques must be fulfilled .",
    "coherently , recently , several models have been systematically tackled via the smooth cavity field by the authors , namely the curie - weiss model @xcite , the fully connected @xmath2-spin model @xcite , the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite , its diluted counter part viana - bray model @xcite and the diluted ferromagnetic model @xcite .",
    "all these models can just be seen as different components of a more general class including models based on binary agents with mean field interactions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cubo ] ) .",
    "now , in order to complete the analysis of the free energies for the whole class , the x - or - sat ( of the random optimization theory @xcite ) and the diluted ferromagnetic @xmath2-spin model , are still missing ; this paper is devoted to the study of the latter .",

    ", the graph can be specified by fixing the number of nodes @xmath3 and its `` connectivity '' @xmath4 , which represents the number of nearest neighbors per site .    as standard ferromagnets",
    ", the model is shown to exhibit two phases , a paramagnetic one and a ( replica symmetric ) ferromagnetic one , on the the other hand , as a difference with respect to the standard ferromagnet , the phase transition does not display criticality for @xmath0 .",
    "the model is investigated by means of cavity field technique and extensive numerical simulations .",
    "we find an expression for the free energy as a function of @xmath2 , of the network connectivity @xmath4 and of the ( inverse ) temperature @xmath5 , showing that it is consistent with known results .",
    "in particular , by properly tuning @xmath2 and @xmath4 we recover the curie - weiss model @xcite , the diluted ising model @xcite and the fully - connected @xmath2-spin model @xcite ; moreover , regardless of the ( finite ) dilution , for @xmath1 criticality is restored . full agreement with monte carlo simulations",
    "is obtained both on the absence of the critical behavior and on the free energy structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath6 the model is introduced and some of its properties worked out together with the introduction of a proper statistical mechanics machinery , while in section @xmath7 its equilibrium is solved via the smooth cavity field technique .",
    "section @xmath8 deals with the properties of the free energy and its consistency with well known models , while in section @xmath9 our numerical analysis is presented .",
    "section @xmath10 is left for a summary and outlook .",
    "finally , section @xmath11 , as an appendix , contains the detailed proofs of the theorems introduced .",
    "in this section we explore the properties of a diluted even-@xmath2-spin ferromagnet : we restrict ourselves only to even values of @xmath2 for mathematical convenience as the investigation with the cavities is much simpler .",
    "however , due to monotonicity of all the observables in @xmath2 , such restriction does not imply any loss of generality , as confirmed also by numerical simulations performed on both even and odd values of @xmath2 .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is worth recalling some concepts concerning the diluted random network where the magnetic system is set .",
    "such a network is an erds - renyi graph @xcite defined as follows : given a number @xmath3 of nodes , we introduce connections between them in such a way that each pair of vertices @xmath12 has a connecting link with independent probability equal to @xmath13 , with @xmath14 . as a result ,",
    "the probability distribution for the number of links per node ( or coordination number ) is binomial with average @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath4 provides a measure of the `` degree of connectivity '' of the graph itself : the smaller @xmath4 the more diluted the system ; for @xmath15 and @xmath16 the extreme cases of fully disconnected and fully connected graphs , respectively , are recovered .",
    "notice that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath17 the binomial distribution converges towards the poisson distribution @xcite .",
    "the er graph can be algebraically described by the so - called adjacency matrix @xmath18 which is an @xmath19 symmetric matrix whose entry @xmath20 is @xmath21 if @xmath22 and the two nodes are connected together , otherwise it is zero .",
    "we now associate to each node @xmath23 a binary variable @xmath24 $ ] and we introduce @xmath2 families @xmath25 of i.i.d .",
    "random variables uniformly distributed on the previous interval .",
    "then , the hamiltonian is given by the following expression @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the number of connected @xmath2-plets present in the graph .",
    "reflecting the underlying network , @xmath27 is a poisson distributed random variable with mean value @xmath28 .",
    "the relation among the coordination number @xmath4 and @xmath29 is @xmath30 : this will be easily understood a few lines later by a normalization argument coupled with the high connectivity limit of this mean field model .",
    "the quenched expectation of the model is given by the composition of the poissonian average with the uniform one performed over the families @xmath31 @xmath32 = e_pe_i[\\cdot ] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty } \\frac{e^{-\\gamma n}(\\gamma n)^k}{k!n^p}\\sum_{i_{\\nu}^1 .... i_{\\nu}^p}^{1,n}[\\cdot],\\ ] ] where the term @xmath33 accounts for the number of possible ordered @xmath2-plets .",
    "as they will be useful in our derivation , it is worth stressing the following properties of the poisson distribution : let us consider a function @xmath34 , and a poisson variable @xmath27 with mean @xmath28 , whose expectation is denoted by @xmath35 .",

    ".  terms . to see the connection to a more familiar hamiltonian written in terms of adjacency matrix elements , we first notice that being @xmath37 the probability that two nodes are connected , among the @xmath38 possible @xmath2-plets , the number of connected @xmath2-plets is poisson - distributed with average @xmath39 for large @xmath3 .",
    "we now define the adjacency tensor @xmath40 which equals @xmath21 whenever the @xmath2-plet @xmath41 occurs to be connected ; @xmath42 is poisson distributed and has mean @xmath43 . hence , we can write the following hamiltonian which is thermodynamically equivalent to @xmath44 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) : @xmath45    then , it is enough to consider the streaming of the following interpolating free energy ( whose structure proves the statement a priori by its thermodynamic meaning ) , depending on the real parameter @xmath46 $ ] @xmath47 where @xmath27 is a poisson random variable with mean @xmath48 and @xmath42 are random poisson variables with mean @xmath49 . in this way",
    "the two separated models are recovered in the two extremals of the interpolation ( for @xmath50 ) . by computing the @xmath51-derivative ,",

    "@xmath58 where @xmath59 is the partition function . taken @xmath60 as a generic function",

    "n=1n_i=1^n^(1)_i ... ^(n)_i , with a particular attention at the magnetization @xmath65 and to the two replica overlap @xmath66 .",

    "then , in the high connectivity limit each agent interacts with all the others ( @xmath68 ) and , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath69 .",

    "let us work out the derivative with respect to @xmath51 to obtain @xmath79 by which we see that the correct scaling , in order to recover the proper infinite connectivity model , is obtained when @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 is held constant .",
    "it is worth noting that for @xmath1 we recover the correct scaling of the diluted curie - weiss model @xcite , furthermore the dilute @xmath2-spin model reduces to the fully connected one , in the infinite connectivity limit , uniformly in the size of the system .",
    "in this section we want to look for an iterative expression of the free energy density by using a version of the cavity strategy @xcite that we briefly recall : the idea behind the cavity techniques @xcite , which , for our purposes , resembles the stochastic stability approach @xcite , is that information concerning the free energy density can be extrapolated when looking at the incremental extensive free energy given by the addition of a spin . in diluted models ,",
    "this additional spin changes also ( infinitesimally in the high @xmath3 limit ) the connectivity and , in evaluating how the free energy density varies conformingly with this , we are going to prove that it can be written by a cavity function and such a connectivity shift .",
    "so the behavior of the system is encoded into these two parts .",
    "the latter is simpler as it is made up only by stochastically stable terms ( a proper definition of these terms will follow in the current section ) .",
    "conversely , the former term needs to be expressed via these terms and this must be achieved by iterative expansions .",
    "at first we show how the free energy density can be decomposed via these two parts ( the cavity function and the connectivity shift ) .",
    "then , we analyze each term separately .",
    "we will see that they can be expressed by the momenta of the magnetization and of the multi - overlaps , weighted in a perturbed boltzmann state , which recovers the standard one in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "[ primolevi ] _ in the thermodynamic limit , the quenched pressure of the even @xmath2-spin diluted ferromagnetic model is given by the following expression _ a ( , ) = 2 -a ( , ) + ( , , t=1 ) ,    where the cavity function @xmath83 is introduced as @xmath84= \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\textbf{e}\\big[\\ln \\frac{z_{n , t}(\\tilde{\\gamma},\\beta ) } { z_{n}(\\tilde{\\gamma},\\beta)}\\big ] = \\psi_n(\\tilde{\\gamma},\\beta , t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with [ cavity2 ] ( , , t ) = _ n_n(,,t ) .",
    "for the sake of clearness and to avoid interrupting the paper with long technical calculations , the proof of the theorem is reported in the appendix .",
    "thanks to the previous theorem , it is possible to figure out an expression for the pressure by studying the properties of the cavity function @xmath85 and the connectivity shift @xmath86 . using the properties of the poisson distribution ( [ pp1 ] , [ pp2 ] ) , we can write @xmath87 = \\nonumber \\\\ & = & ( p-1)\\alpha^{p-2}\\textbf{e}\\big[\\ln \\sum_{\\{\\sigma\\ } } e^{\\beta\\sum_{\\nu=1}^{k+1 } \\sigma_{i_{\\nu}^1} ... \\sigma_{i_{\\nu}^p } } -   \\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber & - & \\ln \\sum_{\\{\\sigma\\ } } e^{\\beta\\sum_{\\nu=1}^{k } \\sigma_{i_{\\nu}^1} ... \\sigma_{i_{\\nu}^p}}\\big ] .",

    "further , as we expect that the order parameters is able to describe thermodynamics even in the true boltzmann states @xmath95 @xcite , accordingly to the following definitions , we are going to show that _ filled _ order parameters ( the ones involving even numbers of replicas ) are stochastically stable or , in other words , are independent of the @xmath51-perturbation in the thermodynamic limit , while the others , not filled , become filled , again in this limit ( such that even for them @xmath96 in the high @xmath3 limit and thermodynamics is recovered ) .",
    "the whole is explained in the following definitions and theorems of this section .",
    "we define the t - dependent boltzmann state @xmath94 as @xmath97 where @xmath98 extends the classical partition function in the same spirit of the numerator of eq.([dente ] ) itself , and @xmath99 .",

    "now , coherently with the implication of thermodynamic limit ( by which @xmath104 for @xmath103 ) , we are going to define the _ filled _ overlap monomials and show their independence ( stochastic stability ) with respect to the perturbation encoded by the interpolating parameter @xmath51 .",
    "these parameters are already  good \" order parameters describing the theory , while the others ( the not - filled ones ) must be expressed via the formers , and this will be achieved by expanding them with a suitably introduced streaming equation",
    ".    we can split the class of monomials of the order parameters in two families :    * we define _ filled _ or equivalently _ stochastically stable _ those overlap monomials with all the replicas appearing an even number of times ( i.e. @xmath105 ,  @xmath106,@xmath107 ) .",

    "it is now immediate to obtain the linear order parameter constraints ( often known as aizenman - contucci polynomials @xcite ) of the theory : in fact , the generator of such a constraint is the streaming equation when applied on each filled overlap monomial ( or equivalently it is possible to apply the streaming on a not - filled one and then gauge the obtained expression ; for the sake of clearness both the methods will be exploited , the former for @xmath124 and the latter for @xmath109 ) .    as examples , dealing with the terms @xmath125 and @xmath126 , it is straightforward to check that @xmath127 then , by gauging the above expression , in the thermodynamic limit , ( as @xmath128 ) , we get @xmath129 the fact that the previous expression holds for every @xmath121 suggests self - averaging for the energy ( by which all the linear constraints can be derived @xcite ) due to the first term , as well as replica symmetric behavior of the two replica overlap due to the last one .",
    "analogously , the contribution of the @xmath130 generator is @xmath131 which shows replica symmetric behavior of the magnetization by the first term and the classical aizenman - contucci relations @xcite by the latter .",
    "furthermore , turning now our attention to the free energy , it is easy to see that the streaming equation allows to generate all the desired overlap functions coupled to every well behaved @xmath119 . in this way ,",
    "if @xmath119 is a not filled overlap , we can always expand recursively it into a filled one , the only price to pay given by the @xmath121 order that has to be reached or , which is equivalent , the number of derivatives that have to be performed .",

    "hence , if we apply the streaming equation machinery to the overlaps constituting equation ( [ psit2 ] ) , we are able to fill them and to remove their @xmath51-dependence in the thermodynamic limit . in this way we are allowed to bring them out from the final @xmath51-integral .",
