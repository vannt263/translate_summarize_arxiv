    "the lhc has recently started its second phase of run .",
    "the discovery of a new scalar particle of mass @xmath15 125 gev has been confirmed @xcite . the properties of this newly discovered resonance seem to be in close agreement with that of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson of the same mass @xcite .",
    "the production modes for the higgs boson at the lhc are those via the gluon - gluon fusion , the vector boson ( @xmath16 ) fusion and the associated production with a vector boson ( @xmath16 ) or top quarks whereas its most effective decay modes are into 4 leptons ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 channels .",
    "one of the main goals of the current lhc run with increased centre of mass energy and higher luminosity is to find out whether the discovered particle is the standard model higgs boson or a part of an extended higgs sector containing several other physical scalars .",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite has a far richer spectrum than that of the sm .",
    "the model has two cp - even neutral scalars ( the lighter and the heavier ones @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively ) , one cp - odd neutral scalar ( @xmath23 ) and two charged scalars ( @xmath24 ) . at the tree level ,",
    "only two input parameters other than the z - boson mass ( @xmath25 ) are required to specify the higgs sector of the mssm .",
    "these inputs are @xmath26 the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 the ratio of vaccum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgs doublets of the mssm ( @xmath29 ) . dependence on other input parameters are induced once the radiative corrections to the higgs mass are taken into account .",
    "we note that the couplings of @xmath22 to the gauge bosons such as @xmath30 , @xmath31 are proportional to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the higgs mixing angle@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "couplings like @xmath34 , @xmath35 are proportional to @xmath36 .    in the well - known decoupling limit of the mssm@xcite characterized by the mass hierarchy @xmath37 , all the higgs bosons become much heavier than the lightest one ( @xmath21 ) making the latter to have sm - like mass as well as couplings .",
    "in this limit one has @xmath38 indicating negligibly small values for the aforesaid couplings of the heavier higgs bosons .",
    "thus , it seems natural to consider the higgs particle observed at the lhc as the lightest cp - even higgs of the mssm in the decoupling limit .",
    "however , the other possibility of having a non - decoupling regime of the mssm where the observed boson at 125 gev is interpreted as the heavier cp - even higgs scalar @xmath22 can be consistent with the non - decoupling regime of the mssm higgs bosons where @xmath39@xcite . in this case",
    ", all the mssm higgses would be light with the lightest one lying somewhat below 125 gev .",
    "the above non - decoupling scenario may get its motivation from an old result by the lep collaboration which corresponds to an excess of higgs - like events around a mass of 98 gev @xcite .",
    "the excess was found in the channel @xmath40 with @xmath21 decaying into @xmath41 . in a combined analysis of the four lep working groups",
    "this excess reached a significance of 2.3@xmath42 .",
    "the above phenomena can not be explained within the sm since the sm higgs boson would give rise to a larger production cross - section . in our previous analysis of ref.@xcite",
    "we explored the possibility of interpreting the 2.3@xmath42 excess events in the mssm with the name ` inclusive lep - lhc higgs ( illh ) scenario ' where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are required to correspond to the lep excess near 98 gev and the observed resonance at @xmath15 125 gev at the lhc respectively .",
    "there have been several studies in this direction and a partial list may be seen in ref.@xcite . in spite of the fact that the above mssm scenario is believed to be cornered in recent times @xcite",
    ", we believe that it is important to review the current status of the scenario in relation to the latest lhc data via focussing our attention in relevant zones of appropriate parameters of mssm in a model independent way .",
    "we must note that if this scenario is indeed realized then @xmath26 the value of @xmath43 must be very small in order to explain the small @xmath44 coupling at lep and @xmath28 the couplings of @xmath22 must be similar to that of the sm higgs in order to be compatible with the 125 gev resonance observed at the lhc .",
    "the parameter region which satisfies these two requirements must also pass through other direct constraints coming from the lhc , the most important ones are given as below .",
    "* exclusion limits in the channel @xmath45 : both the atlas and cms collaborations have searched for a neutral higgs - like boson @xmath46 in the decay channel @xmath47 for certain benchmark scenarios @xcite . however , in order to perform a model - independent analysis one must consider the bounds on @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 , where @xmath42 denotes the production cross - section for the non - minimal higgs boson @xmath46 decaying into the di - tau channel .",
    "two different production modes for @xmath46 are considered namely , the gluon - gluon fusion and the associated production with b - quark . * searches for @xmath24 : the atlas and cms searches for @xmath24 are performed in @xmath50 events with subsequent decays @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "model - independent upper bounds are obtained for @xmath53 .",
    "these searches exclude @xmath29 up to 6 for 90 gev @xmath54 150 gev .",
    "these two searches together restrict @xmath29 to have a very narrow range .",
    "moreover , the constraints from heavy flavor physics also become very important in this region of parameter space . in particular , experimental limits on @xmath55 and @xmath56 are able to play very crucial roles to constrain the mssm parameter space under question .    in ref.@xcite",
    "we imposed all of the above bounds on the mssm parameter space to probe whether it could accommodate the illh scenario .",
    "however , for the higgs signal strength constraints we used a conservative lower bound on @xmath57 ( see eq.[rdef1 ] ) taken as @xmath58 . afterwards",
    ", the bounds from the atlas and cms collaborations for the pseudoscalar and charged higgs search channels have become more stringent . on the other hand ,",
    "the higgs signal strength results have become more precise in recent times .",
    "thus it seems very reasonable to reanalyze the 98 - 125 gev higgs scenario in the light of the updated collider constraints and to check whether there is any room left in the mssm framework to accommodate a 98 gev higgs boson .    in this work",
    "we perform a detailed scan over the mssm parameter space to find out the region allowed by all the relevant collider constraints mentioned above .",
    "we also demand that the mssm parameter space must satisfy the planck limit on dark matter relic density . keeping these issues in mind we explore the possibility of observing the signals of the illh scenario in the high - luminosity run of the lhc .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we discuss the major constraints imposed on the mssm parameter space of our interest and the parameter ranges we choose to perform the scanning procedure .",
    "the impact of the constraints on the mssm parameter space as well as the main features of the allowed zone are studied in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we analyze the prospects of the illh scenario in the high luminosity run of the lhc .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "in this section we enumerate the essential constraints and the scanning details of the mssm parameter space considered in this analysis .",
    "the illh scenario requires that the lightest cp - even higgs boson should have a mass around 98 gev , while the one observed at the lhc at 125 gev to be the heavier cp - even higgs boson .",
    "thus , we consider the following ranges for @xmath59 and @xmath60 . @xmath61",
    "an uncertainty of 3 gev in the higgs boson mass is assumed which may come from the top mass uncertainty , uncertainties in the renormalization scheme and higher order loop corrections  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath62 must lie within the following range in order to satisfy the lep limit .",
    "@xmath63      the different production mechanisms of the standard model higgs boson at the lhc are the gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) , vector boson fusion ( vbf ) and associated production with gauge bosons ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) or with a pair of top quarks ( @xmath66 ) . among its various possible decay modes ,",
    "the decay into a pair of bottom quarks is the most dominant one .",
    "other sub - dominant decay modes include final states involving a pair of sm gauge bosons ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 and @xmath69 etc .",
    "the di - photon final states refer to loop - induced phenomena involving @xmath70-boson and heavy fermion loops .",
    "both the atlas and cms collaborations have analyzed various production and decay modes of the higgs boson observed at 125 gev and put bounds on the various couplings of the sm higgs .",
    "the signal strength parameter @xmath18 is defined as the ratio between the measured higgs boson rate and its sm expectation as follows : @xmath71 here , @xmath72 represents the production cross - section for a given new physics model with @xmath73= ggf , vbf , vh and @xmath66 processes for a generic higgs boson @xmath22 with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath47 being the decay modes of the higgs boson .",
    "the subscript ",
    "sm \" represents the respective sm expectations . in table",
    "[ tab : higgs ] , we display the most updated combined results on various higgs signal strengths by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite .",
    "the subscript ` f ' denotes the combined data for the ggf and @xmath66 process , while ` v ' signifies the combined vbf and vh processes .",
    "even though the higgs production through the  fusion \" ( f ) mode includes both the ggf and @xmath66 processes , here we consider the ggf process only since @xmath78 2% as estimated by the combined atlas & cms data and also uncertainties in higgs signal strength measurements associated to the @xmath66 process being relatively large .    .combined results of the higgs coupling measurements by the atlas and cms collaborations at the end of 7 + 8 tev run of the lhc with approximately 25 @xmath79 of data @xcite [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      precise measurement of the various higgs signal strength variables can prove to be significant to indirectly probe / exclude the illh scenario .",
    "we find that the important observables which can play crucial roles in this regard are @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 for a given production mechanism of the observed 125 gev higgs boson . before going into a detailed analysis of these observables ,",
    "let us first discuss some of the important higgs boson couplings .",
    "the tree level yukawa coupling of the bottom quark with the heavy higgs boson of the mssm having a mass around 125 gev goes as @xmath83 where @xmath29 is the ratio of the vevs of the two higgs doublets .",
    "however , loop corrections ( in orders of @xmath84 ) involving various supersymmetric particles can significantly modify the tree level @xmath85 yukawa coupling .",
    "these effects are generally denoted by the quantity @xmath86 and the additional contribution coming from @xmath86 can be summarized as @xcite , = ( 11+_b ) ( 1+_b ) . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : c1_c2c3 ] , we show the dependence on @xmath86 of the quantity @xmath87 which estimates the loop contribution to the tree level yukawa coupling .",
    "we find that the effect of @xmath86 is indeed significant in the parameter space of our interest .",
    "in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : c1_c2c3 ] , we show the variation of the complete @xmath85 coupling ( the effect of @xmath86 included ) with the tree level coupling .",
    "it is evident from both the figures that for a significant number of points @xmath86 is indeed large .",
    "thus , even though the maximum value of the tree level coupling goes up to 1.4 - 1.5 , the total @xmath85 coupling never exceeds unity , implying that the @xmath85 coupling is always suppressed with respect to the sm expectation which can indeed serve as a very distinctive feature of the illh scenario .",
    "let us now turn our attention to another important decay mode @xmath88 . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sin2alpha_hzzratio ] , we show the variation of the ratio @xmath89 to the square of the tree level @xmath90 coupling @xmath91 . here , @xmath92 denotes the partial width of the decay @xmath88 in the mssm and @xmath93 denotes the same for the sm .",
    "the behaviour is well understood ; as the coupling decreases so does the partial width .",
    "however , we must note that the @xmath94 partial width is also suppressed in this case .",
    "with both the partial widths for the decays @xmath95 and @xmath94 suppressed , one can expect to observe a significant suppression in the total decay width of the higgs boson as well . from the plot in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sin2alpha_hzzratio ] , where the x - axis denotes the ratio @xmath89 and the y - axis stands for the ratio of the total higgs decay width ( @xmath96 ) in the mssm to that in the sm ( @xmath97 ) , one can easily observe the suppression in the total decay width .",
    "thus , one may also expect to find a mild enhancement in partial widths of the sub - dominant decay modes like @xmath68 , @xmath98 .",
    "improved measurement of the signal strength variables at the high luminosity run of the lhc may help us to probe the illh scenario indirectly .",
    "we present a detailed study in this regard as follows .",
    "we have already introduced the signal strength variables in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] . here",
    ", we discuss the variables which we find interesting and which are seen to have some impact to probe / exclude the parameter space of our interest . in the left - most panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : corrln ] , we display the correlation in the @xmath99 plane .",
    "we assume gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) process as the production mechanism for the higgs boson decaying into @xmath100 while for the final state @xmath101 the higgs is taken to be produced via vector - boson fusion ( vbf ) process .",
    "we find that although @xmath102 can vary in the range 0.6 - 1.6 , the values of @xmath103 is seen to be suppressed i.e. , less than unity .",
    "furthermore , even though gluon - gluon fusion process is the dominant one , associated production mechanism of the higgs can also be used to measure these signal strength variables .",
    "we discuss the correlations of three such variables , namely @xmath104 , @xmath103 and @xmath105 . in the middle and right - most panel",
    "we show the correlations in the @xmath106 and @xmath107 planes respectively .",
    "similar to the ggf case , there are no such restrictions on the values of @xmath104 .",
    "however , we find a strong anti - correlation between @xmath103 and @xmath105 .",
    "the values of @xmath103 is found to be always less than unity while those of @xmath105 to be dominantly greater than unity . at this point",
    ", one might be interested to know the present status of the measurement of these higgs signal strength correlations at the lhc . in fig .  [",
    "fig : muv_muf ] , we study these correlations in the @xmath108 - @xmath109 plane for a generic final state @xmath110 , and then compare the model predictions with the 95% correlation contours obtained using the 10-parameter fit for the five decay modes of the observed higgs boson by the atlas and cms combined 7 and 8 tev data @xcite . in the left panel ,",
    "we show @xmath69 , @xmath100 and @xmath111 channels while right panel for @xmath101 and @xmath68 .",
    "the subscript ` f ' denotes the combined ggf and @xmath66 process , while ` v ' signifies the combined vbf and vh processes .",
    "however , here for the  fusion \" ( f ) mode we consider ggf only as higgs production via ggf is much larger compared to the @xmath66 process . comparing the correlation plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : muv_muf ] ) with table [ tab : higgs ] , we find that at present the impact of these correlations at the parameter space of interest is comparable with that of the individual signal strengths ( less than 2% points are found to be outside the 95% c.l",
    ". contours ) .",
    "however , here we would like to note that with precise measurements in the future runs of lhc these contours are expected to shrink , this may lead to interesting consequences for our model parameter space . considering the future improvements in signal strength measurements ,",
    "if we assume that at the high luminosity run of the lhc with 3000 @xmath79 of data @xmath104 can be measured with an accuracy at the level of 30% , then from these correlations we can infer that @xmath105 will always have values larger than unity .",
    "however , @xmath103 will be less than 0.8 .",
    "thus , for a given measurement of the signal strength variable in the @xmath100 channel , observation of suppression of the same quantity for the @xmath101 channel and enhancement in the @xmath112 channel will be an ideal probe of the illh scenario .",
    "before we end this section , let us summarize our results from the collider analysis .",
    "we analyze the most important production mechanism of the 98 gev higgs boson , namely the vbf and associated production processes , and find that these processes are not sensitive enough to exclude the illh scenario .",
    "we then attempt to exclude this possibility indirectly using various higgs signal strength variables , and here we find very distinctive features in the correlations of the signal strength variables for @xmath113 , @xmath112 and @xmath100 decay channels .",
    "however , there exists several other processes which can also be used directly to probe this scenario , e.g. the associated production of the 98 gev higgs boson with a pair of top quarks ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "even though this process do not directly involve the @xmath115 coupling , still it can be used to probe this scenario . in our earlier work @xcite",
    ", we performed a naive collider analysis of this process , following the same analysis for a sm higgs boson @xcite , and obtained a 2.6@xmath42 statistical significance without considering systematic uncertainties .",
    "a more detailed study is required , specially focusing on the boosted regime and applying the jet substructure technique , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "interestingly , we can also discover / exclude the 98 - 125 gev higgs scenario by looking for the other higgses present in this model , e.g. the neutral cp - odd higgs @xmath23 and the charged higgs bosons @xmath24 .",
    "one of the most important characteristic signatures of this illh scenario is the presence of relatively light @xmath23 and @xmath24 bosons with masses @xmath116 200 gev .",
    "the pseudoscalar higgs @xmath23 is produced via gluon - gluon fusion and/or @xmath101 fusion process and , if kinematically allowed , can decay to @xmath117 giving rise interesting final state topologies involving multi - leptons and multiple b - jets . on the other hand ,",
    "the charged higgs bosons are produced by @xmath118 process and decays dominantly into @xmath119 and @xmath120 final states . a dedicated analysis for these very light cp - odd and charged higgses in the context of high luminosity run of the lhc",
    "is required .",
    "we leave this very interesting possibility for our future work .",
    "thus , _ the observation of a charged higgs and a pseudoscalar higgs boson with masses between 140 - 200 gev and simultaneously the non - observation of any cp - even higgs in the same region will be a direct probe of the illh scenario_. furthermore , productions of these light higgses in pair , e.g. processes like @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 are also very interesting possibilities at the lhc .",
    "there exists a study considering all of these processes at the lhc in the context of non - decoupling region of the mssm @xcite .",
    "however , the authors focused only on the regions with masses of these higgses lying between 95 - 130 gev .",
    "note that , this 95 - 130 gev region is already excluded by the pseudoscalar and charged higgs searches at the lhc , and thus a study focussing on the region 140 - 200 gev is now required which we plan to address in our future correspondence .",
    "we would like to mention that in our earlier work we discussed the possibility of observing the 98 gev higgs boson directly at the ilc .",
    "we found that the above could be easily discovered / excluded at the 250 gev ilc with a 100 @xmath79 of luminosity which is easily achievable within the first few years of its run .",
    "finally we would like to add one important point regarding the direct measurement of various susy particles at the high luminosity ( hl ) run of lhc .",
    "the expected exclusion limits at the hl - lhc for the top and bottom squarks are around 1 tev , for charginos and neutralinos around 600 gev while for gluinos around 2.5 tev @xcite .",
    "we check that even with such a heavy sparticle spectrum , there is ample parameter space which satisfies the current lhc data , thus we conclude that it is almost impossible to exclude the 98 - 125 gev scenario even at the high luminosity run of lhc .",
    "the objective of this work is to interpret the lep excess observed around a mass of @xmath15 98 gev as the lighter cp - even higgs boson of the mssm while the lhc - observed scalar at @xmath15 125 gev plays the role of the heavier one .",
    "we analyze this scenario in the light of the latest results from the lhc including the limits on higgs signal strengths",
    ". other relevant constraints like those coming from the flavor sector e.g. @xmath55 , @xmath56 and the dm relic density constraint are also taken into account .",
    "the atlas / cms searches in the @xmath45 and charged higgs searches restrict the values of @xmath29 to a very narrow range . by performing a detailed random scan over the mssm parameter space",
    "we try to pin point the region of parameter space where all the above constraints can be simultaneously accommodated .",
    "we observe that the illh scenario can still be harboured within the mssm framework .",
    "the values of @xmath18 required to satisfy the above criteria are generically large @xmath125 7 tev and @xmath126 tends to assume only appreciably large positive values .    to perform the analysis in a model independent",
    "way we use the limits on @xmath127 , @xmath42 being the production cross - section of the non - standard higgs boson @xmath46 .",
    "the lhc limits are available for ggf and vbf production processes .",
    "we observe that @xmath128 lies well below the experimental limit for the small values of @xmath29 considered in this analysis .",
    "however , the values of this observable for associated production with @xmath41 seems to be very close to the present experimental bound .    in the illh scenario that is associated with a light @xmath129",
    ", the constraint from @xmath55 plays an important role to eliminate a large region of parameter space .",
    "we remember that the associated sm contributions almost saturate the the experimental limit .",
    "generally , the @xmath130 loop contributions are not large enough to effectively cancel the contributions from the @xmath131 loops where @xmath129 is light .",
    "this causes a large amount of the parameter space to be discarded .",
    "it is only for large @xmath18 zone ( with large @xmath126 values ) along with sign@xmath132 the nlo contributions arising out of the top - quark yukawa coupling partially cancel the leading order contributions of the @xmath131 loops .",
    "additionally , there is an overall suppression coming out of sqcd corrections to the mass @xmath133 .",
    "thus the available parameter space that satisfies @xmath55 constraint has large values of @xmath18 with sign@xmath132 . the other constraint",
    "namely @xmath56 is not a very stringent one in this zone of parameter space that survive the @xmath55 constraint .",
    "an important result regarding the higgs signal strength variables is obtained when we closely study the points satisfying all the constraints along with the limits on @xmath134 .",
    "if we further demand that values of @xmath135 lie within 20% around the sm value of unity , all the points are seen to have @xmath136 .",
    "as already mentioned , the loop correction to bottom quark yukawa coupling and hence to bottom quark mass ( @xmath137 ) is significantly large in the present case .",
    "this reduces the partial decay width @xmath138 .",
    "the value of @xmath139 is also small , leading to a reduction in the total decay width .",
    "however , the @xmath140 can be significantly large .",
    "thus , for the points with @xmath141 the value of @xmath142 is seen to be @xmath143 .",
    "this can play a major role as a distinctive feature of the present scenario provided the sensitivity on the coupling strength measurements is increased to a desired accuracy .",
    "we analyze the possibilities of observing the illh scenario in the 14 tev run of the lhc in two production channels , the vector boson fusion process and associated production with @xmath7 boson . for the vbf process",
    "we follow the atlas simulation for the decay mode @xmath144 .",
    "the selection cuts are varied to obtain an optimum signal to background ratio .",
    "we simulate only the @xmath145 + jets events as the dominant sm background in this analysis . from statistical significances of the three optimized scenarios considered here",
    "we conclude that the possibility of observing the illh scenario with 3000 @xmath79 of luminosity is rather small .",
    "for the higgstrahlung processes we concentrate on the highly boosted regime where the higgs boson of mass 98 gev is produced with @xmath146 200 gev .",
    "three different scenarios are considered here depending on the decays of the associated gauge boson .",
    "these are the @xmath147 process with @xmath70 decaying leptonically , the @xmath148 process with @xmath145 decaying to @xmath149 pair , the @xmath150 process with invisible decays of the @xmath145 boson .",
    "we generate both the signal and background events through a detailed monte carlo simulation following the atlas analysis .",
    "the results are presented for three optimized selection regions along with the one using default selection cuts . from the results we observe that the illh scenario can be marginally ruled out with 3000 @xmath79 of luminosity at the 14 tev run of the lhc .",
    "* the most updated lhc data along with the low energy physics flavor data and bounds from dark matter searches does not exclude the possibility of having a 98 - 125 gev higgs scenario .",
    "we provide two sample benchmark points in support of our results . *",
    "the possibility for direct detection of the 98 gev higgs boson at the run-2 of the lhc is marginal even after using the state - of - the - art jet substrcuture technique .",
    "* however precise measurements of the higgs signal strengths may act as an indirect probe of the illh scenario .",
    "we find interesting correlations between these signal strength variables .",
    "for example , the quantity @xmath151 is always less that unity , thus we find that if we can measure the higgs signal strength associated to the higgs decay to @xmath100 then we must see a strong suppression in the @xmath101 mode .",
    "we expect at the high luminosity run of lhc these measurements will be improved by few orders of magnitude , and thus could easily be used as a probe of the illh scenario .",
