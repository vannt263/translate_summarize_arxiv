    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are interacting binaries where a low mass star transfers matter onto a neutron star ( ns ) or black hole ( e.g. charles & coe 2004 ) .",
    "there are @xmath9200 bright ( l@xmath10 erg s@xmath4 ) lmxbs in the galaxy and most of them harbour neutron stars as implied by the detection of x - ray bursts / pulsations . about @xmath920 of these have period determinations but only in very few cases ( e.g. cyg x-2 : casares et al .",

    "2005 ) , a full orbital solution and mass determination exists thanks to the spectroscopic detection of the giant companion star . for the others , the companion is completely swamped by reprocessed light from the accretion flow and this has hampered detailed knowledge of their dynamical properties .",
    "+ x1822 - 371 ( v691 cra ) is one of the brightest lmxbs in the optical , and also the prototypical accretion disc corona ( adc ) source due to its low @xmath11 @xmath920 ratio ( it is usually @xmath9500 - 1000 ) . in adc sources ,",
    "the combination of high inclination and a thick disc obscures the central source , and only x - rays scattered from material above and below the disc can reach the observer ( white & holt 1982 ) .",
    "thanks to eclipses of the accretion disc by the companion star on a 5.57h orbital period ( hellier & mason 1989 ; hereafter hm89 ) an accurate determination of the inclination angle exists , i=82.5 @xmath121.5 ( heinz & nowak 2001 ; hereafter hn01 ) .",
    "the source also displays 0.59s x - ray pulses ( jonker & van der klis 2001 ) which enables an extremely precise determination of the neutron star radial velocity semiamplitude of @xmath13=94.5@xmath120.5 km s@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the only parameter missing for an accurate mass determination in x1822 - 371 is the radial velocity curve of the companion star .",
    "hei absorption features attributed to the irradiated hemisphere of the companion star were presented in harlaftis , horne & charles ( 1997 ) , jonker et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and cowley et al .",
    "they measured @xmath14 km s@xmath4 , @xmath15 km s@xmath4 and @xmath16 km s@xmath4 respectively by fitting sine waves to the hei radial velocity curves .",
    "however , as jonker et al",
    ". pointed out the spectroscopic t@xmath17 is delayed by @xmath18 with respect to the photometric eclipses and pulsar ephemeris and hence asymmetric irradiation of the roche lobe needs to be invoked .    in casares et al .",
    "( 2003 ; hereafter c03 ) , the first unambiguous detection of the donor star is reported using the niii @xmath194640-bowen emission line with a velocity amplitude of @xmath20 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the phasing of the niii velocity curve is perfectly consistent with the pulsar ephemeris with no need for ad hoc asymmetric illumination effects .",
    "furthermore , they show that the hei absorptions come from the accretion stream and not from the companion star .",
    "this naturally explains the phase offset with the pulsar ephemeris observed in previous works .",
    "however , the niii - bowen emission line is excited on the inner hemisphere of the donor star and only provides a lower limit to the true @xmath21-velocity .",
    "narrow high - excitation emission lines originating from the companion star have also been detected in the prototypical lmxb sco x-1 ( steeghs & casares 2002 ) , and in the black hole x - ray transient gx339 - 4 during its 2002 outburst ( hynes et al .",
    "these narrow features are strongest in the bowen blend , a set of resonant emission lines ( mainly ciii and niii @xmath22 ) excited by photoionization and the bowen mechanism ( mcclintock , canizares & tarter 1975 ) .",
    "the roche lobe shaped donor star intercepts the energetic photons from the inner accretion disc resulting on the observed optical emission lines from its surface .",
    "the doppler motion of these lines trace the orbit of the companion star and provide the first reliable binary parameters in persistent lmxbs .",
    "however , the secondary is not uniformly illuminated by the ionizing photons and , therefore , the radial velocity curve of the sharp features traces the motion of the reprocessed light - center rather than the true center of mass of the star .",
    "+ in this paper we model the deviation between the reprocessed light - center and the center of mass of a roche lobe filling star ( the so - called `` k - correction '' ) in a persistent lmxb , including screening effects by a flared accretion disc .",
    "we apply our simulations to the case of x1822 - 371 and conclude that it must contain a massive ns with @xmath23 , for any possible value of the disc flaring angle .",
    "k - correction for radial velocity curves derived from absorption lines formed on the companion s photosphere was presented by wade & horne ( 1988 ; hereafter wh88 ) . in this case ,",
    "absorption lines are quenched in the heated face and hence the observed k - velocity provides only an upper limit to the real @xmath24 , i.e. the true velocity of the center of mass of the companion star .",
    "here , we study the k - correction for the case of irradiated - induced spectral lines originating from the heated face of the donor star , which is the opposite case to the one presented in wh88 . this problem was firstly addressed by horne & schneider(1989 ; hereafter hs89 ) but it was only applied to the particular case of nova v1500 cyg without screening effects by a possible accretion disc .",
    "also beuermann & thomas ( 1990 ) studied this problem for the case of the cataclysmic variable ix velorum .",
    "they considered only two different accretion disc angles together with the orbital parameters of this binary . in this paper",
    "we tackle the problem in a general approach and derive a k - correction expression for all possible @xmath0 values and obscuring disc elevations .",
    "following the prescription of hs89 , the light - center of the emission line region(@xmath25 is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 represents the light - center displacement from the center of mass of the donor star and @xmath28 is the distance between the center of mass of the companion and the center of mass of the system .",
    "@xmath29 is the mass ratio and @xmath30 the binary separation . using this nomenclature ,",
    "the difference between the @xmath21 and the observed emission line velocity ( @xmath31 ) is    @xmath32    and therefore ,    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is an dimensionless factor which represents the displacement of the emission light - center from the center of mass of the companion in units of @xmath30 . in the limit case where all the emission line is formed at the inner lagrange point(@xmath35 )    @xmath36 ( plavec & kratochvil 1964 )    where @xmath37 is the distance between @xmath35 and the center of mass of the companion star . on the other hand ,",
    "we can consider the extreme case where the emission line comes from the irradiated point with maximum radial velocity .",
    "this point is located at the limb of the irradiated region and holds an opening angle @xmath38 above the plane of the binary .",
    "this is the highest possible angle for the companion to be irradiated and it has been tabulated by r. pennington in table a3 of the appendix to pringle & wade ( 1985 ) .",
    "an approximate analytical expression , as a function of q , is provided by paczynski equation ( 1971 ) ,    @xmath39    then , if we assume that the roche lobe is spherical ( which is a good approximation when we are far from @xmath35 ) it is easy to show that the minimum @xmath34 displacement is given by @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , in any possible situation @xmath34 will always be constrained between these two cases i.e.    @xmath41    these limits are presented in fig .",
    "[ figf ] , plotted in dashed line . here",
    "we have used the exact @xmath38 values calculated by our code ( see below ) which obviously coincide with the ones tabulated by r. pepringter",
    ".    however , the upper limit obtained is purely theoretical since @xmath35 will never be the only irradiated point of the donor star .",
    "a more realistic upper limit can be obtained by simulating emission lines formed by isotropic irradiation on the inner hemisphere of the companion in a roche lobe geometry .",
    "we have divided the roche lobe filling star in @xmath2 triangular tiles of equal surface .",
    "the flux from the x - ray source which is reprocessed in each tile will be given by ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the x - ray flux emitted by the compact object , @xmath44 the area of the tile , @xmath45 the distance between the tile and the center of mass of the primary star , @xmath46 the projection factor of the tile as seen by the x - ray source and @xmath47 the albedo .",
    "the total reprocessed emission line flux seen by a distant observer is obtained by integrating @xmath48 over the roche lobe geometry , where @xmath49 is the projection factor of each irradiated tile as seen by the observer and @xmath50 represent a local gaussian profile . we have not included limb - darkening effects in the simulation because these are expected to be negligible in the optically thin case that we are considering here . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have also included in our simulations a linearized limb darkening , appropriate to the continuum ( i.e. optically thick case ) , and found it had no impact on the results .",
    "+    radial velocity curves were subsequently computed by measuring the position of the maxima in the synthetic profiles ( which are not symmetric ) , and @xmath31 is determined from the maxima of the radial velocity curves .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath21 eq ( 1 ) gives the @xmath34 values as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "these values , as expected , are not found to depend on either @xmath47 nor @xmath43 .",
    "the synthetic @xmath51 curve is plotted in fig .",
    "[ figf ] in solid line and a 4th order polynomial fit ( which is accurate to better than 1% ) to this curve yields    @xmath52q@xmath53    then , the real value of @xmath34 will be constrained between these two limits i.e. @xmath54 and will depend on the size of the companion ( i.e. the mass ratio ) and the height of the accretion disc rim obscuring the heated star .",
    "+ in a second step , we have incorporated shadowing effects by a flared and opaque accretion disc with an opening angle @xmath1 independent of azimuth .",
    "figure [ figc ] presents the synthetic radial velocity curves computed for four different disc obscuring angles .",
    "the plot shows how the radial velocity curves start to deviate from pure sinewave functions when @xmath1 decreases . because the velocity amplitude is strongly dependent on @xmath1 so it does the k - correction .",
    "therefore , using our binary code we have computed the relation between the ratio @xmath55 and @xmath0 for different values of the flaring angle @xmath1 and these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figkc ] in solid line .",
    "[ figci ] we also explore the effect of the inclination angle in the shape of the radial velocity curve .",
    "this plot shows that the morphology of the radial velocity curves clearly depends on the inclination angle and hence , @xmath56 could be a function of this parameter as well . using our numerical model",
    "we have found that ( in the most extreme cases when @xmath57 ) , @xmath56 can be @xmath58 smaller for low inclination angles than for @xmath59 . to illustrate the effect of the inclination angle",
    "we have also computed the k - correction for @xmath60 and different @xmath1 values , and these are overplotted in fig .",
    "[ figkc ] in dash - dotted line .",
    "+ the synthetic k - corrections produced by the numerical code are very smooth and can be well described by fourth - order polynomial fits .",
    "table 1 , lists the coefficients of the fits for the two values of the inclination considered and different opening angles ( from @xmath61 to @xmath62 ) which cover the typical values observed in xrbs and cataclysmic variables .",
    "these fits are accurate to better than 1% between @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for the case of intermediate inclinations",
    "the interpolated solution between @xmath59 and @xmath60 is accurate to @xmath65% .",
    "for @xmath66 the @xmath67 value gives also a very good aproximation ( @xmath68% ) .",
    "note that the value of @xmath56 obtained for @xmath59 yields a secure lower limit to the masses of the binary components for all possible cases .",
    "+ for intermediate @xmath1 and @xmath69 values one needs to interpolate the k - correction solutions and not the coefficients .",
    "hence , for a given mass ratio @xmath0 , the k - correction is provided by :    @xmath70    note that , since the k - correction is only meaningful if @xmath71 ( otherwise the companion will be completely shadowed by the disc ) , eq .",
    "( 2 ) sets a lower limit to q for each @xmath1 , ( see fig 4 . ) . for this reason the first values of @xmath0 considered in the fits for @xmath1= @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath62 are @xmath0= 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.26 , 0.4 and 0.58 respectively . as a test ,",
    "we have computed the k - correction for the binary parameters of nova v1500 cyg and obtain @xmath76 in excellent agreement with hs89 .",
    "now we can apply our computed k - correction to the case of x1822 - 371 and derive the masses for the two components . in c03 a @xmath31= 300 @xmath128 km s@xmath4 was reported through the detection of the niii @xmath22-bowen emission line arising from the companion star .",
    "this value , combined with the previous determination of the inclination angle and the pulsar s radial velocity curve , yields absolute lower limits @xmath77 and @xmath78 , assuming @xmath79 ( see c03 ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , the mass function equation can be expressed as @xmath80 where p is the orbital period and g is the gravitational constant . in the case of x1822 - 371 , where @xmath69 and @xmath81 are known , this equation provides a direct relation between @xmath0 and @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , this can be combined with our synthetic k - correction curves to yield @xmath31-@xmath82 relations for different disc opening angles @xmath1 .",
    "+ c03 obtained @xmath83 km s@xmath4 by fitting the niii@xmath22 spot in the doppler map with a 2d - gaussian function .",
    "instead , we have computed the centroid of the spot intensity distribution and obtain a more conservative value of @xmath31= 300 @xmath1215 km s@xmath4 , which we prefer since it does not impose any model to the fit . in order to test whether the k - correction derived by our model can be used to correct the @xmath31 value extracted from the doppler tomography we have simulated irradiated profiles ( using our derived parameters of x1822 - 371 , see below ) for the orbital phases of the c03 observations .",
    "these were smeared according to the exposure times used and subsequently degraded to the spectral resolution of the observations . finally , we added noise to reproduce the observed spectra .",
    "a doppler map was then computed and the centroid of the spot was found to be in excellent agreement , within the errors , with the value above .",
    "furthermore , we note than the same @xmath31 was obtained by sc02 in sco x-1 from the radial velocity curve and doppler tomography .",
    "+ under the assumption that the bowen emission lines are formed on the critical roche lobe of the companion the detection of this emission at @xmath84 15 km s@xmath4 directly yields @xmath85 and @xmath86 through the geometrical limit @xmath87 .",
    "however , realistic mass determinations require the knowledge of the disc rim elevation obscuring the companion .",
    "de jong et al . ( 1996 ) derived a mean disc opening angle of @xmath88 by studying the effects of x - ray reprocessing in lmxbs .",
    "this value was also derived by hm89 for the highest disc structure ( i.e. the bulge at phase @xmath90.8 ) in x1822 - 371 by modeling simultaneous optical and x - ray exosat lightcurves . however , in hn01 a higher angle of @xmath89 is obtained by fitting x - ray rxte+asca lightcurves .",
    "these estimates correspond to the disc elevation at the phase of the bulge , and therefore , must be treated as upper limits to the height of the disc rim obscuring the companion , which is constrained to @xmath90 . in any case , these opening angles are expected to be , in general , only slightly higher than the real ones , and hence , we have calculated the @xmath31-@xmath91 relation for both disc thicknesses as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . if we take into account , the opening angles considered , the inclination uncertainty and the errors in the observed @xmath31 , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that the mass of the neutron star is constrained to the range    @xmath5 .",
    "we would like to remark that this provides a conservative lower limit to @xmath92 .",
    "if the accretion disc were thinner the mass would be even higher .",
    "for instance , if @xmath93 ( i.e. no disc ) , @xmath92 must be @xmath94 @xmath95 in order to reproduce the observed @xmath31 at @xmath96 km s@xmath4 .",
    "besides , since the neutron star mass and the mass ratio are related by the mass function we obtain @xmath7q@xmath8 which leads to    @xmath6 .",
    "the detection of irradiated - induced emission lines originating from the heated face of the companion star can yield important restrictions to the mass of the binary components .",
    "@xmath31 contains intrinsic information about the companion s regions responsible for reprocessing the x - ray / uv radiation .",
    "since the orbital parameters of x1822 - 371 are tightly constrained , the key missing information for a realistic simulation are the structures present between the companion and the x - ray source .",
    "our simple model only takes into account screening effects by a flared accretion disc .",
    "however , the presence of a disc corona scattering the x - rays / euv radiation might modify the results of our simulations since irradiating photons could reach ( otherwise obscured ) regions of the roche lobe with lower velocities .",
    "consequently , the scattered radiation is expected to push the k - correction to lower values and hence the ns to higher masses . as a test we have included emission from a corona which has been roughly simulated by five x - ray spots symmetrically distributed around the compact object at a distance of @xmath97 ( i.e.",
    "the corona radii derived in hn01 ) .",
    "the integrated flux of this simplified corona was scaled to be 1% of the accretion luminosity i.e. 10@xmath98 erg s@xmath4 for an assumed compact object luminosity of 10@xmath99 erg s@xmath100 .",
    "our simulation shows that the effect of such a corona in the k - correction is completely negligible .",
    "even if we rise the luminosity of the corona to 10% of the central x - ray source and take @xmath101 , the effect in @xmath31 is lower than 1% . in this extreme case ,",
    "the mass of the ns would only rise by @xmath102 m@xmath103 with respect to neglecting the effect of corona scattering . in summary ,",
    "our simulation provides compelling arguments for the presence of a massive ns in x1822 - 371 + to date , the most accurate neutron star mass determinations have been provided by studying radio pulsars .",
    "these works reflect that the mass of the neutron star at formation is @xmath104 ( van kerkwijk 2001 ) .",
    "however , recent studies have revealed evidences for heavier neutron stars in old white dwarf + pulsar systems , especially in j0751 + 1807 where a mass between 1.6 - 2.8 @xmath105 has been reported by nice , splaver , & stairs ( 2004 ) .",
    "there is no compelling evidence for massive neutron stars in active xrbs yet , but possible candidates are cyg x-2 , with @xmath106 ( casares et al .",

    "2004 ; jonker et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the latter case",
    "the nature of the compact object is an open issue since ns signatures ( x - ray burst , pulses ) have not yet been detected .",
    "the evidence for a massive ns in x1822 - 371 reinforces the theory that lmxbs could harbour heavy neutron stars due to sustained episodes of high mass transfer .",

    "this value is consistent with a @xmath114 m0 main sequence(ms ) star ( cox 2000 ) and it is in excellent agreement with our derived mass .",
