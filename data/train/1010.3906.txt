    "neutron stars in general can have magnetic fields as large as @xmath3 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite while the timing observations indicate that the surface magnetic fields of the radio pulsars are about @xmath4 @xcite , by equating magnetic field energy to the gravitational binding energy , one can estimate an upper limit for strength of the magnetic field to be @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile cooling processes in the neutron stars formation that has long been considered by many physicists , can be affected by such a large magnetic field in two ways .",
    "it can change the electron or the photon conductivities @xcite,@xcite , @xcite as well as the wave functions and the propagators of the particles involving in the cooling processes .",
    "one of the most important reactions during the thermal evolution of the neutron stars is the emission of neutrino via the bremsstrahlung process @xmath6 in the first sight it seems that since the mass of the nucleons are about 1`gev ` therefore the magnetic fields even as large as @xmath7 can not significantly change the cross section .",
    "however one should note that there are more energy scales besides the mass of the nucleons .",
    "in fact one of the scales is the temperature of the evolving neutron star which becomes less than 1`mev ` in a few seconds of the late - time cooling phase and is comparable with @xmath8 . furthermore if one consider one - pion - exchange ( ope ) for the nucleon - nucleon interaction then the magnetic fields of the order of @xmath9 and more can change the strong coupling constant as well .",
    "meanwhile in such a low temperature era the bremsstrahlung process can only produce the soft neutrinos with respect to the initial energies and therefore the neutrino emissivity can be related to the on - shell nn scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "thus to find the neutrino emissivity one can study the nucleon - nucleon scattering separately .",
    "the amplitude can be even constructed from nn scattering data , as is done in @xcite as a model independent way to describe the neutrino emissivity .",
    "but the usual studies on the nucleon - nucleon scattering in ope approximation @xcite and more precisely the existing data are in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "our aim in this paper is to examine the magnetic field dependence of the nucleon - nucleon scattering in the ope approximation when soft neutrino approximation is applicable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we give the field operators of the proton and neutrons in an external magnetic field .",
    "consequently we obtain the cross section of the scattering in the magnetic field in section 3 .",
    "an estimation for the effect of strong magnetic field on the neutrino emissivity is presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we give some concluding remarks .",
    "appendix a is devoted to solving the dirac equation for proton and neutron in an external magnetic field . in appendix",
    "b we present a simplified expression for the amplitude matrix elements of the scattering process .",
    "to study the proton - neutron scattering in a strong external magnetic field , the field operators of the proton and neutron are needed .",
    "since the field operators contain wave functions and energy spectrum , dirac equation in presence of an external magnetic field must be solved .",
    "we choose the external magnetic field to be in the positive @xmath10-axis @xmath11 . because of gauge invariance there is a freedom in the choice of vector potential @xmath12 , thus for simplicity we choose @xmath13 this choice of vector potential pushes all the @xmath14-dependence into the spinors alone and not in the phases , so it is useful to introduce the following notations @xmath15 where @xmath16 is any 2-vector .",
    "the solutions of the dirac equation for proton and neutron in the external magnetic field ( [ 101 ] ) are presented in the appendix a. by using this solutions the proton field operator can be written as @xmath17,\\ ] ] where the creation and annihilation operators obey the following anticommutation relations @xmath18 with the help of ( [ 104 ] ) , the explicit form of the wave functions given in the equations ( [ a16 ] ) , ( [ a19 ] ) and the completeness relation ( [ a8 ] ) , it can be shown that the equal - time anticommutation relation is satisfied @xmath19 for convenience we normalize our 1-particle states in a box with dimensions @xmath20 such that the proton state is @xmath21 similarly for the neutron field operator one has @xmath22,\\ ] ] in which the creation and annihilation operators obey the following anticommutation relations @xmath23 by using the relations ( [ 108 ] ) and the explicit form of the wave functions given in the equations ( [ a21 ] ) and ( [ a24 ] ) it is easy to show that equal - time anticommutation relation is satisfied @xmath24 box normalization condition for the neutron 1-particle state is @xmath25",
    "our aim in this section is to explore the scattering cross section of @xmath26 in the background of a strong magnetic field , @xmath27 , using the one - pion - exchange approximation .",
    "the deferential cross section can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the flux of the incident particles , @xmath30 is the time interval , @xmath31 is the average of the squared scattering matrix elements and @xmath32 is the deferential phase space of the final states .",
    "the effective low energy lagrangian for pion - nucleon interaction is @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the pion - nucleon coupling constant and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are neutron , proton and pion fields , respectively . to obtain the scattering matrix elements in the external magnetic field we use the standard method where the wave functions and propagators are modified with the external magnetic field while the vertices are leaved unchanged .",
    "the proton - neutron scattering at the tree level involves two diagrams , one is mediated by the neutral pion @xmath38 @xmath39 and the other is mediated by the charged pion @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , respectively , correspond to the incoming and outgoing protons ( neutrons ) . since the neutral pion has no charge its propagator in the external magnetic field does not change , but the propagator of charged pion will be modified .",
    "in fact the propagator of the charged pion as a charged scalar particle in an external magnetic field can be obtained as @xcite @xmath46 in which @xmath47 is the field strength tensor of the external magnetic field and @xmath48 the temperature of a neutron star in a few seconds in the late - time cooling phase , drops to less than 1 ` mev ` therefore the energy is sufficiently low to use the four - fermion approximation , @xmath49 . in this case the propagator ( [ 214 ] ) can be cast into @xmath50    in the four - fermion approximation , @xmath51 actually shows how the strong coupling constant depends on the external magnetic field .",
    "the b - dependence of the coupling constant is explicitly shown in fig .",
    "1 . by using the explicit form of the proton and neutron field operators ( [ 103 ] ) and",
    "( [ 107 ] ) and the definitions of the 1-particle states ( [ 106 ] ) and ( [ 110 ] ) , the scattering matrix elements can be obtained as follows @xmath52 where the neutral current scattering amplitude is given by @xmath53 [ \\bar{u}_{n'}(\\vec{k}',r')\\gamma^{5}u_{n}(\\vec{k},r)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the charged current is @xmath54 [ \\bar{u}_{n'}(\\vec{k}',r')\\gamma^{5}u_{p}(y , n,\\vec{p}_{\\y},s)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we are ready to calculate the scattering cross section in the external magnetic field . for this purpose",
    "we have @xmath55 where using the normalization relation for the dirac @xmath56-functions @xmath57 cast the squared amplitude into @xmath58 now the equations ( [ 201 ] ) , ( [ 223 ] ) and the deferential phase space of the final states in the external magnetic field @xmath59 can be used to find the corresponding deferential cross section as follows @xmath60 since the nucleons in the neutron star are nonrelativistic their energies and wave functions can be expanded up to the order of @xmath61 and the amplitude @xmath62 can be obtained analytically as is given in the appendix b. meanwhile one can easily show that @xmath63 therefore the leading term in the scattering cross section ( [ 225 ] ) is @xmath64 after integrating over @xmath65 , @xmath66 with the help of the dirac @xmath56-functions and defining @xmath67 equation ( [ 227 ] ) leads to @xmath68 ) and ( [ b13 ] ) one has @xmath69 where @xmath70 is defined as @xmath71 the positive solution of ( [ 2211 ] ) is @xmath72 now one can perform the integration over @xmath73 to find @xmath74 where @xmath75 while the integration bounds over @xmath76 can be determined by the following equation @xmath77 to evaluate @xmath27 in the equation ( [ 2214 ] ) first one needs to determine the maximum landau - level that proton can occupy in the initial state , i.e. @xmath78 . since we would like to consider the process ( [ 01 ] ) in the temperature range @xmath79 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite therefore nucleons are nonrelativistic and the energy eigenvalues for the protons and neutrons can be given by ( [ b12 ] ) and ( [ b13 ] ) , respectively . according to the virial theorem",
    ", each nucleon at a temperature @xmath30 has a momentum for each component about @xmath80 .",
    "therefore one can easily obtain the maximum landau - level by comparing the magnetic energy contribution to the proton @xmath81 , see ( [ b12 ] ) , with the thermal energy as @xmath82 .    in this section we obtained the cross - section in the background of a strong magnetic field @xmath27 by considering ope in the four - fermion approximation . for simplicity",
    "we calculate the cross - section in the head - on collisions i.e. @xmath83 .",
    "since we would like to find if the magnetic field can significantly change the thermal evolution of the neutron stars , it would be better to normalize our result with the cross - section in the absence of the magnetic field , @xmath84 , but with the same approximations and conditions i.e. @xmath85 , or @xmath86 therefore the deviation @xmath87 as a function of the magnetic field and temperature can be given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 the variation of @xmath90 as a function of the external magnetic field for different temperatures are shown in the figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the nn - scattering cross section in the magnetic fields as large as @xmath0 shows that the strong magnetic filed of the neutron stars might change the neutrino emissivity and therefore the cooling process .",
    "the rate of emission and absorbtion of neutrino in the strong magnetic field of a neutron star have been already considered for the urca process in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite for a strange stars with all charged particles in the lowest landau level , it is shown that the magnetic field accelerates the cooling process .",
    "while in @xcite it is found that the direct urca emissivity is strongly enhanced and oscillates as a function of the magnetic field which globally tends to average out .",
    "here we would like to consider the effect of strong magnetic field on the neutrino bremsstrahlung process ( [ 01 ] ) . to obtain the emissivity at the tree level one should consider all feynman diagrams at this level . here for simplicity we just consider the diagram given in fig.[fig4 ] to give an order of magnitude for the emissivity and leave the complete calculation for future study . for this purpose",
    "we use the pion - nucleon interaction lagrangian ( [ 202 ] ) and the weak interactions lagrangian @xmath91z^{0}_{\\mu}.\\ ] ] according to the fermi s golden rule , neutrino emissivity in the magnetic field can be written as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the total energy of neutrino with the momentum of @xmath94 and antineutrino with the momentum of @xmath95 , all other momenta have the same definition as was given in the last section .",
    "@xmath96 is defined in terms of the fermi - dirac distribution functions of nucleons as @xmath97 in which @xmath98 is the chemical potential of the nucleon .",
    "now we consider the nucleons , comparing the available energies , as non - relativistic particles .",
    "furthermore the anomalous magnetic moment in the energy spectrum of nucleons are negligible , see eqs .",
    "( [ b12 ] ) , ( [ b13 ] ) .",
    "meanwhile since the neutrinos are soft the three - momenta of neutrino and antineutrino can be dropped from the dirac @xmath56-functions .",
    "therefore the spin summed over the squared scattering matrix element can be obtained as    @xmath99    where @xmath100 in which the functions @xmath101 are defined in ( [ b2 ] ) . substituting ( [ 404 ] ) in the emissivity expression ( [ 402 ] ) yields @xmath102 one should note that the range of @xmath103 can be fixed in a natural way as @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "furthermore to perform the integrals the momentum of particles for a degenerate system , can not be larger than the fermi momenta that in turns depend on the density of system and implicitly on the temperature @xcite , so the phase space integrals of the initial particles confined to the fermi surface . while the remanning integrals on the phase space of the final particles can be accomplished using the momentum conserving dirac @xmath56-functions . here",
    "we define @xmath105 where @xmath106 shows the corresponding emissivity in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "the variation of @xmath107 with respect to the neutron star magnetic field for different temperature is shown in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "we have examined the nucleon - nucleon scattering in a large magnetic background in a neutron star at the temperature about 1 ` mev ` .",
    "since the energy is low we can safely use the one - pion - exchange approximation and the four - fermion approximation .",
    "in fact the external magnetic field can change the effective coupling constant that is shown in the fig.1 . as the figure shows",
    "the coupling is insensitive to the background field up to the @xmath9 and then by increasing the magnetic field to @xmath108 the squared value of the strong coupling constant decreases to 0.6 its initial value .",
    "however the magnetic field can change the nucleon wave functions and their corresponding field operators as well , see equations ( 4 ) and ( 8) .",
    "therefore the cross - section has an overall change as given in equation ( 34 ) .",
    "the variation of the cross - section , for head - on collisions , in a magnetic background that is normalized with its correspondence without background but with the same approximations are drawn in the fig.2 and fig.3 for different temperatures .",
    "as the figures show the deviation for the lower temperature start in the lower magnetic fields .",
    "nevertheless to have a significant deviation the magnetic field even for the temperature as low as 0.1 ` mev ` , should be grater than @xmath109",
    ". we also studied the neutrino bremsstrahlung emissivity by considering just one feynman diagram for this process at the tree level to give an estimate on the neutrino emissivity in a strong magnetic field . as is shown in the fig.[fig5 ] around @xmath110 the emissivity changes about an order of magnitude with respect to its corresponding value without magnetic filed .",
    "furthermore the enhancement on the emissivity is higher for the lower temperature",
    ". therefore the thermal evolution of the neutron stars in the late time cooling era for @xmath111 can be dramatically changed .",
    "in this appendix we drive the wave functions of proton and neutron in the external magnetic field by tracing a procedure similar to @xcite .",
    "dirac equation for a particle with mass @xmath112 , charge @xmath113 and anomalous magnetic moment @xmath114 in presence of the external magnetic field ( [ 101 ] ) is @xmath115 where the canonical momentum @xmath116 is given by the minimal coupling @xmath117 by using the standard pauli - dirac representation for dirac matrices @xmath118 and general form of the wave function @xmath119 the following system of equations will be obtained @xmath120 to solve equations ( [ a5 ] ) one can assume @xmath121 where the function @xmath122 is defined as @xmath123 the function @xmath124 is the hermit polynomial and in according to the definition @xmath125 . using this choice for normalization constant @xmath126 , it can be showed that the functions @xmath122 satisfy the completeness relation @xmath127 where @xmath128 is given by replacing @xmath14 by @xmath129 in the definition of the @xmath130 ( [ a7 ] ) . after substituting equations ( [ a6 ] ) in the system of equations ( [ a5 ] ) , the system of linear equations for coefficients @xmath131 will be obtained as follows @xmath132 equations ( [ a9 ] ) have a non trivial solutions for @xmath131 if the determinant of the coefficients be zero . imposing this condition yields the spectrum of the energy @xmath133 in the energy spectrum ( [ a10 ] ) index of @xmath43",
    "is called landau level . to solve equations ( [ a9 ] )",
    "it is better to introduce the fermion spin projection operator on the direction of the magnetic field as @xmath134 since the operator @xmath135 commutes with the dirac hamiltonian @xmath136 , the wave functions are eigenstate of this operator @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath135 . then using the equations ( [ a12 ] ) and ( [ a6 ] ) , one leads to the following system of liner equations for the coefficients @xmath131 @xmath139 again by imposing the condition that , determinant of the coefficients must be zero , @xmath138 can be determined as @xmath140 now by using the equations ( [ a9 ] ) , ( [ a13 ] ) and the following normalization condition , the coefficients @xmath131 can be determined @xmath141 therefore the wave function can be obtained as @xmath142 where the quantities @xmath143 and @xmath144 are defined as @xmath145 and the normalization constant @xmath146 of the wave function is @xmath147 one can easily find the wave functions for the negative energy spinors by doing the similar procedure . in this case",
