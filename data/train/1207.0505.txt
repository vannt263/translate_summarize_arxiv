    "there is strong evidence in the structure of classical gravitational theories to suggest that gravitational field equations in a wide class of theories , including but not limited to einstein s general relativity , have the same status as the equations of fluid mechanics or elasticity , which are examples of emergent phenomenon .",
    "( for a review , see @xcite and @xcite ; for a small sample of work in the same spirit , see @xcite . )",
    "given the intimate connection between gravity and cosmology , such a change in perspective has important implications for cosmology . in particular , ideas of emergence of spacetime find a natural home in the cosmological setting and provide a novel  but mathematically rigorous and well - defined  way of interpreting cosmological expansion as emergence of space ( as the cosmic time progresses ) .",
    "this , in turn , leads to a deep relation between inflationary phase of the early universe and the late time accelerated expansion of the universe . in this review",
    ", i will describe various facets of this approach , concentrating on the cosmological context .",
    "the plan of the review is as follows .",
    "the next section describes the evidence which has led to the interpretation that gravitational field equations are emergent . in section  [ sec : entmax ] , i discuss how these ideas allow us to obtain the gravitational field equations by maximizing the entropy density of spacetime instead of using the usual procedure of varying the metric as a dynamical variable in an action functional . in section  [ sec : emcos ] , i describe the implications of this approach for cosmology and how the cosmic evolution can be thought of in a completely new manner . section  [ sec : connect ] uses these ideas to connect up the two phases of the universe in which exponential expansion took place , viz . the inflationary phase in the early universe and the late time accelerating phase at the present epoch . among other things , this approach allows us to link the current value of the cosmological constant @xmath1 to the @xmath0-folding factor @xmath2 during inflation by @xmath3 for @xmath4 which is appropriate .",
    "_ astronomers and those who are essentially interested in cosmology can skip sections 2 , 3 and go directly to section 4 . _",
    "i will begin by describing several pieces of internal evidence in the structure of gravitational theories which suggest that it is better to think of gravity as an emergent phenomenon . to understand these in proper perspective ,",
    "let us begin by reviewing the notion of an emergent phenomenon .",
    "useful examples of emergent phenomena include gas dynamics and elasticity .",
    "the equations governing the behaviour of a gas or an elastic solid can be written down entirely in terms of certain macroscopic variables ( like density , velocity , shape etc . ) without introducing notions from microscopic physics like the existence of atoms or molecules .",
    "such a description will involve certain phenomenologically determined constants ( like specific heat , young s modulus etc . ) which can only be calculated when we know the underlying microscopic theory . in the thermodynamic description of such systems ,",
    "we however work with suitably defined thermodynamic potentials ( like entropy , free - energy , enthalpy etc . which can depend on these constants ) the extremisation of which will lead to the equilibrium properties of the system .    as an example , consider an ideal gas kept in a container of volume @xmath5 .",
    "the thermodynamic description of such a system will lead to the phenomenological result that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pressure exerted by the gas on the walls of the container and @xmath8 is the temperature of the gas .",
    "one can obtain this result by maximizing a suitably defined entropy functional @xmath9 or the free - energy @xmath10 .",
    "it is , however , impossible to understand _ why _ such a relation holds within the context of thermodynamics .",
    "as pointed out by boltzmann , the notion of heat and temperature _ demands _ the existence of microscopic degrees of freedom in the system which can store and exchange energy .",
    "when we introduce the concept of atoms , we can re - interpret the temperature as the average kinetic energy of randomly moving atoms and the pressure as the momentum transfer due to collisions of the atoms with the walls of the container .",
    "one can then obtain the result @xmath11 in a fairly straightforward manner from the laws governing the microscopic degrees of freedom . as a bonus",
    ", we also find that the proportionality constant in the phenomenological relation , @xmath6 , actually gives @xmath12 which is a measure of the total number of microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "we now proceed from the description of an ideal gas to the description of spacetime",
    ". decades of research have shown that one can associate notions of temperature and entropy with any null surface in a spacetime which blocks information from certain class of observers .",
    "well known examples of such null surfaces are black hole horizon @xcite and cosmological event horizon @xcite in the de sitter spacetime .",
    "the result , however , is much more general and can be stated as follows : any observer in a spacetime who perceives a null surface as a horizon will attribute to it a temperature @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a suitably defined acceleration of the observer . the simplest context in which this result arises is in flat spacetime itself .",
    "an observer who is moving with an acceleration @xmath15 in flat spacetime will think of the spacetime as endowed with a temperature given by .",
    "this result , originally obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for a uniformly accelerated observer , can be generalized to any observer whose acceleration varies sufficiently slowly , in the sense that @xmath16 .",
    "this result shows that near any event in spacetime there exists a class of observers who sees the spacetime as hot .",
    "such observers , called local rindler observers , can be introduced along the following lines : around any event @xmath17 in the spacetime , one can introduce the coordinate system appropriate for a freely falling observer who does not experience the effects of gravity in a local region .",
    "the size @xmath18 of such a region is limited by the condition @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the typical value of the spacetime curvature at the event @xmath17 .",
    "we can now introduce the local rindler observer as someone who is accelerating with respect to the freely falling observer with an acceleration @xmath15 . by making the acceleration",
    "@xmath15 sufficiently large , ( so that @xmath21 ) we can ensure that this observer attributes the temperature in to the spacetime in the local region .",
    "thus , just as one can introduce freely falling observers around any event @xmath17 , we can also introduce accelerated observers around any event and work with them .",
    "the is probably the most beautiful result to have come out of combining the principles of relativity and quantum theory .",
    "one key consequence of this result is that _ all notions of thermodynamics is observer dependent _ when we introduce non - inertial observers ; e.g. , while the inertial observer will consider the flat spacetime to have zero temperature , an accelerated observer will attribute to it a non - zero temperature .",
    "in fact , such an observer dependence of thermodynamic notions exist even in other  more well known  examples like the black hole spacetime .",
    "while an observer who remains stationary outside the black hole horizon will attribute a temperature to the black hole ( in accordance with where @xmath15 is the proper acceleration of the observer with respect to local freely falling observers ) , another observer who is freely falling through the horizon will not associate any temperature with the horizon .",
    "the relationship between the observer at rest outside the black hole horizon and the freely falling observer is exactly the same as the relationship between an accelerated observer and an inertial observer in flat spacetime .",
    "the temperature in _ both _ cases is observer dependent and can be interpreted in terms of .",
    "in fact , the result for rindler observers in flat spacetime can be obtained as a limiting case of a black hole with very large mass .    the notion that spacetimes appear to be hot , endowed with a non - zero temperature , as seen by certain class of observers , already suggest that the description of spacetime dynamics could be analogous to the dynamics of a hot gas described using the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "if this is the case , one should be able to describe the field equations of gravity in terms of thermodynamic notions .",
    "this is the first evidence that gravity is an emergent phenomenon , which i will now describe .      to see the relationship between gravitational field equations and thermodynamics in the simplest context @xcite ,",
    "let us consider a static , spherically symmetric spacetime with a horizon , described by a metric : @xmath22 the location of the horizon is the radius @xmath23 at which the function @xmath24 vanishes , so that @xmath25 . using the taylor series expansion of @xmath24 near the horizon as @xmath26",
    "one can easily show that the surface gravity at the horizon is @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , using we can associate a temperature @xmath28 with the horizon .",
    "this temperature knows nothing about the dynamics of gravity or einstein s field equations .",
    "let us next write down the einstein equation for the metric in , which is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the radial pressure of the matter source .",
    "when evaluated on the horizon @xmath23 this equation becomes : @xmath31 = 4\\pi p a^2 \\label{reqa}\\ ] ] this equation , which is just a textbook result , does not appear to be very thermodynamic ! to see its hidden structure , consider two solutions to the einstein s equations differing infinitesimally in the parameters such that horizons occur at two different radii @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "if we multiply by @xmath34 , we get : @xmath35 the right hand side is just @xmath36 where @xmath37 is what is called the areal volume which is the relevant quantity to use while considering the action of pressure on a surface area .",
    "in the first term , @xmath38 is proportional to horizon temperature in and we can rewrite this term in terms of @xmath8 by introducing a @xmath39 factor ( _ by hand _ , into an otherwise classical equation ) to bring in the horizon temperature .",
    "we then find that reduces to @xmath40 each of the terms has a natural  and unique  thermodynamic interpretation as indicated by the labels .",
    "thus the gravitational field equation , evaluated on the horizon now becomes the thermodynamic identity @xmath41 , allowing us to read off the expressions for entropy and energy : @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the horizon area and @xmath44 is the square of the planck length .",
    "we see that the entropy associated with the horizon is one quarter of its area in planck units . by taking the limit of a black hole of very large mass",
    ", we will reduce the problem to one of accelerated observers in flat spacetime .",
    "so we find that these accelerated observers around any event will attribute not only a temperature but also an entropy to the horizon the latter being one quarter per unit area of the horizon expressed in planck units .",
    "it is well - known that black holes satisfy a set of laws similar to laws of thermodynamics , including the first law and the result derived above has a superficial similarity to it .",
    "however , the above result is _ quite different _ from the standard first law of black hole dynamics .",
    "one key difference is that our result is local and does not use any property of the spacetime metric away from the horizon . while we have an extra term @xmath36 .",
    "the energy @xmath45 used in the conventional first law is defined in terms of matter source while the @xmath46 in our relation is purely geometrical etc . ;",
    "see , for a detailed discussion , @xcite .",
    "] so , the _ same result holds even for a cosmological horizon like de sitter horizon _ once we take into the fact that we are sitting inside the de sitter horizon @xcite . in this case",
    "we obtain the temperature and entropy of the de sitter spacetime to be : @xmath47 just as the result in , this result also generalizes to other friedmann universes ( when @xmath48 is not a constant ) and gives sensible results ; we will discuss these aspects in sec .",
    "[ sec : emcos ] .    unlike the temperature , the entropy _ did _ depend on the field equations of the theory .",
    "what happens if we consider a different theory compared to einstein s general relativity or even some correction terms to einstein s theory ?",
    "remarkably enough , the above result ( viz .",
    "the field equations become @xmath49 ) continues to hold for a very wide class of theories ! in the more general class of theories , one can define a natural entropy for the horizon called the wald entropy @xcite and we again get the same result with correct wald entropy ( for a sample of results see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , there exists a natural extension of einstein s theory into higher dimensions , called lanczos - lovelock  models @xcite .",
    "the field equations in any lanczos - lovelock  model , when evaluated on a static solution of the theory which has a horizon , can be expressed @xcite in the form of a thermodynamic identity @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the correct wald entropy , @xmath52 is a purely geometric expression proportional to the integral of the scalar curvature of the horizon and @xmath36 represents the work function of the matter source . the differentials @xmath53 etc .",
    "should be thought of as indicating the difference in the physical quantities @xmath54 etc between two solutions of the theory in which the location of the horizon is infinitesimally different .",
    "the gravitational field equations , being classical , have no @xmath39 in them while the davies - unruh temperature does . but",
    "note that davies - unruh temperature in scales as @xmath39 and the entropy scales as @xmath55 ( due to the @xmath56 factor ) , making @xmath57 independent of @xmath39 ! without such scaling we could not have reduced classical field equations to a thermodynamic identity involving a temperature that depends on @xmath39 .",
    "this fact strengthens the emergent perspective because this result is conceptually similar to the fact that , in normal thermodynamics , @xmath58 while @xmath59 making @xmath57 independent of @xmath60 . the effects due microstructure",
    "is indicated by @xmath39 in the case of gravity and by @xmath60 in the case statistical mechanics .",
    "this dependence disappears in the continuum limit thermodynamics describing the emergent phenomenon .",
    "the discussion so far dealt with _",
    "static _ spacetimes analogous to states of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium differing in the numerical values of some parameters .",
    "what happens when we consider time dependent situations ?",
    "one can again establish a correspondence between gravity and thermodynamic description , even in the most general case .",
    "it turns out that the einstein s field equations , when projected on to _ any _ null surface in _ any _ spacetime , reduces to the form of navier - stokes equations in suitable variables @xcite .",
    "this result was originally known in the context of black hole spacetimes @xcite and is now generalized to any null surface perceived as a local horizon by suitable observers .",
    "i will not discuss the details of this result here due to lack of space .",
    "the most general  and possibly the most direct  evidence for emergent nature of the field equations is that they can be reinterpreted as entropy balance condition on spacetime .",
    "we will illustrate this result for the friedmann universe in gr and then mention how it can be generalized to arbitrary spacetime in more general theories @xcite .",
    "let us consider a friedmann universe with expansion factor @xmath61 and let @xmath62 .",
    "we will assume that the surface with radius @xmath63 ( in units with @xmath64 ) is endowed with the entropy @xmath65 and temperature @xmath66 . during the time interval @xmath67 ,",
    "the change of gravitational entropy is @xmath68 and the corresponding heat flux is @xmath69 . on the other hand ,",
    "gibbs - duhem relation tells us that for _ matter _ in the universe , the entropy density is @xmath70 and the corresponding heat flux is @xmath71 .",
    "balancing the two gives us the entropy ( or heat ) balance condition @xmath72 which becomes @xmath73 using @xmath74 , this gives the result : @xmath75 which is the correct friedmann equation .",
    "combining with the energy conservation for matter @xmath76 , we immediately find that @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the energy density of the cosmological constant ( with @xmath79 ) which arises an integration constant .",
    "we thus see that the entropy balance condition correctly reproduces the field equation  but with an arbitrary cosmological constant arising as integration constant .",
    "this is obvious from the fact that , treated as a fluid , the entropy density [ @xmath80 vanishes for cosmological constant .",
    "thus one can always add an arbitrary cosmological constant without affecting the entropy balance .",
    "this is a general feature of the emergent paradigm and has important consequences for the cosmological constant problem . in the conventional approach",
    ", gravity is treated as a field which couples to the _ energy density _ of matter .",
    "the addition of a cosmological constant  or equivalently , shifting of the zero level of the energy  is not a symmetry of the theory and the field equations ( and their solutions ) change under such a shift . in the emergent perspective , it is the _ entropy density _ rather than the _ energy density _ which plays the crucial role .",
    "when the spacetime responds in a manner maintaining entropy balance , it responds to the combination @xmath81 [ or , more generally , to @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a null vector ] which vanishes for the cosmological constant . in other words , shifting of the zero level of the energy is the symmetry of the theory in the emergent perspective and gravity does not couple to the cosmological constant .",
    "alternatively , one can say that the restoration of this symmetry allows us to gauge away any cosmological constant thereby setting it to zero .",
    "from this point of view , the vanishing of the bulk cosmological constant is a direct consequence of a symmetry in the theory .",
    "we will see later in section  [ sec : emcos ] that the presence of a small cosmological constant or dark energy in the universe has to be thought of as a relic from quantum gravity when this symmetry is broken .",
    "the smallness of the cosmological constant then arises as a consequence of the smallness of the symmetry breaking .",
    "one can , in fact , reinterpret the field equations in _ any _ gravitational theory , in _ any _ spacetime , as entropy balance equation by a slightly different procedure involving virtual displacements of local rindler horizons @xcite . to obtain this result , consider an infinitesimal displacement of a patch of the local rindler horizon @xmath84 in the direction of its normal @xmath85 , by an infinitesimal proper distance @xmath86 .",
    "it can be shown that the virtual loss of matter entropy to the outside observer because the the horizon has engulfed some matter is given by @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the reciprocal of the redshifted local temperature , with @xmath89 being the lapse function , and @xmath90 is the approximate killing vector corresponding to translation in the local rindler time coordinate .",
    "we next need an appropriate notion of gravitational entropy which can be extracted from the definition of wald entropy .",
    "it is possible to show that the corresponding change in the gravitational entropy is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is known as the noether current corresponding to the local killing vector @xmath90 .",
    "( once again the cosmological constant will not contribute to @xmath93 or @xmath94 when evaluated on the horizon . ) for a general gravitational theory with field equations given by @xmath95 ( where the left hand side is a generalization of the einstein tensor @xmath96 in general relativity ) , this current is given by @xmath97 where @xmath18 is the gravitational lagrangian . using this result and evaluating it on the horizon we get the gravitational entropy to be : @xmath98 comparing this with we find that the field equations @xmath95 can be reinterpreted as the entropy balance condition @xmath99 on the null surface .",
    "this is possibly the most direct result showing that gravitational field equations are emergent .",
    "the results described so far show that there is a deep connection between horizon thermodynamics and the gravitational dynamics .",
    "the spacetime seems to behave as a hot fluid , with the microscopic degrees of freedom  of the spacetime playing a role analogous to the atoms in a gas . in the long wavelength limit ,",
    "one obtains the smooth spacetime with a metric , curvature etc .",
    ", which are analogous to the variables like pressure , density etc . of a fluid or gas .",
    "if we know the microscopic description ( as in the case of the statistical mechanics of a gas ) we can use that knowledge to determine various relationships ( like the ideal gas law @xmath100 ) between the macroscopic variables of the system . but in the context of spacetime we do not know the nature of microscopic degrees of freedom  or the laws which govern their behaviour . in the absence of our knowledge of the relevant statistical mechanics , we have to take a `` top - down '' approach and try to determine their properties from the known thermodynamic behaviour of the spacetime .",
    "let us see one important consequence of such an approach .",
    "given the fact that spacetime appears to be hot , just like a body of gas , we can apply the boltzmann paradigm ( `` if you can heat it , it has microstructure '' ) and study the nature of the microscopic degrees of freedom  of the spacetime  exactly the way people studied gas dynamics _ before _ the atomic structure of matter was understood .",
    "there is an interesting test of this paradigm which , as we shall see , it passes with flying colours .",
    "one key relation in such an approach is the equipartition law @xmath101 relating the number density @xmath102 of microscopic degrees of freedom  we need to store an energy @xmath103 at temperature @xmath8 .",
    "( this number is closely related to the avogadro number of a gas , which was known even before people figured out what it was counting ! ) .",
    "if gravity is the thermodynamic limit of the underlying statistical mechanics , describing the ` atoms of spacetime ' , we should be able to relate @xmath46 and @xmath8 of a given spacetime and determine the number density of microscopic degrees of freedom  of the spacetime when everything is static .",
    "remarkably enough , we can do this directly from the gravitational field equations @xcite .",
    "einstein s equations _ imply _ the equipartition law between the energy @xmath46 in a volume @xmath5 bounded by an equipotential surface @xmath104 and degrees of freeddom on the surface : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the local acceleration temperature and @xmath107 with @xmath108 being proper surface area element .",
    "this allows us to read off the number density of microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "we see that , unlike normal matter  for which the microscopic degrees of freedom  scale in proportion to the volume and one would have obtained an integral over the volume of the form @xmath109  the degrees of freedom now scale in proportion to _ area _ of the boundary of the surface . in this sense",
    ", gravity is holographic . in einstein s",
    "theory , the number density @xmath110 is a constant with every planck area contributing a single degree of freedom .",
    "the true importance of these results again rest on the fact that they remain valid for all lanczos - lovelock  models with correct surface density of degrees of freedom @xcite .    considering the importance of this result for our later discussions ,",
    "i will provide an elementary derivation of this result in the newtonian limit of general relativity , to leading order in @xmath111 .",
    "consider a region of 3-dimensional space @xmath5 _ bounded by an equipotential surface _",
    "@xmath104 , containing mass density @xmath112 and producing a newtonian gravitational field @xmath113 through the poisson equation @xmath114 . integrating @xmath115 over the region @xmath5 and using the gauss law",
    ", we obtain @xmath116 since @xmath117 is an equipotential surface @xmath118 is the magnitude of the acceleration at any given point on the surface . once again , introducing a @xmath39 into this classical newtonian law to bring in the davies - unruh temperature @xmath119 we get the result : @xmath120 which is exactly the newtonian limit of the holographic equipartition law in .    in the still simpler context of spherical symmetry ,",
    "the integration over @xmath121 becomes multiplication by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the radius of the equipotential surface under consideration and we can write the equipartition law as : @xmath124 where @xmath125 in this form , we can think of @xmath126 $ ] as the degrees of freedom of the matter residing in the bulk and can be thought of as providing the equality between the degrees of freedom in the bulk and the degrees of freedom on the boundary surface .",
    "we will call this _ holographic equipartition _ , which among other things , implies a quantization condition on the bulk energy contained inside any equipotential surface .    in the general relativistic case ,",
    "the source of gravity is proportional to @xmath127 rather than @xmath128 . in the non - relativistic limit",
    ", @xmath115 will dominate over @xmath7 and the equipartition law @xmath129 relates the rest mass energy @xmath130 to the surface degrees of freedom @xmath131 . if we instead decide to use the normal kinetic energy @xmath132 of the system ( where @xmath133 is the typical velocity determined through , say , the virial theorem @xmath134 ) , then we have the result @xmath135 where @xmath136 can be thought of as the _ effective _ number of degrees of freedom which contributes to holographic equipartition with the kinetic energy of the self - gravitating system . in virial equilibrium , this kinetic energy is essentially @xmath137 and hence the gravitational potential energy inside an equipotential surface is also determined by @xmath138 by : @xmath139 we thus find that , for a non - relativistic newtonian system , the rest mass energy corresponds to @xmath140 of surface degrees of freedom in holographic equipartition while the kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom @xmath141 which is smaller by a factor @xmath142 .",
    "in the case of a black hole , @xmath143 , making @xmath144 leading to the equality of all these expressions .",
    "we will see later on that the difference @xmath145 plays a crucial role in cosmology and i will discuss its relevance for newtonian gravitational dynamics in a future publication .      in obtaining the previous results we have used the equations of motion of classical gravity and hence we can think of these results as being `` on - shell '' . in the standard approach one obtains the field equations by extremising a suitable action functional with respect to the metric tensor . because the _ field equations _ allow a thermodynamic interpretation , one would suspect that the _ action functional _ of any gravitational theory must also encode this fact in its structure .",
    "this is indeed true .",
    "there are several peculiar features exhibited by the action functional in a very wide class of gravitational theories which makes it stand apart from other field theories like gauge theories etc . in the conventional approach",
    "there is no simple interpretation for these features and they have to be taken as some algebraic accidents . on the other hand",
    ", these features find a natural explanation within the emergent paradigm and i will briefly discuss couple of them .",
    "one of the key features of the action functional describing einstein s general relativity is that it contains a bulk term ( which is integrated over a spacetime volume ) and a surface term ( which is integrated over the boundary of the spacetime volume ) . to obtain the field equations , one either has to cancel out the variations in the surface term by adding a suitable counter - term @xcite or use special boundary conditions . in either case , the field equations arise essentially from the variation of the bulk term with the boundary term of the action playing absolutely no role .",
    "what is remarkable is that , if we now evaluate the boundary term on the surface of the horizon which occurs in any solution of the field equation , we obtain the entropy of the horizon !",
    "this raises the question : how can the boundary term know anything about the bulk term ( and the properties of the solution obtained by varying the bulk term ) especially because we threw away the surface term right at the beginning ?",
    "the reason for this peculiar feature has to do with a special relationship between the bulk and the boundary terms leading to the duplication of information between the bulk and the boundary .",
    "it can be shown that , not only in general relativity but in all lanczos - lovelock  models , the bulk and surface terms in the lagrangian are related by : @xmath146    more importantly , it is possible to provide an interpretation of gravitational action as the free - energy of the spacetime for static metrics which possess a horizon .",
    "the boundary term of the action gives the entropy while the bulk term gives the energy with their sum representing the free - energy of the spacetime . as an illustration of this result ,",
    "let us consider the metrics of the form in for which the scalar curvature is given by the expression @xmath147 \\label{reqn}\\ ] ] since this is a total divergence , the integral of @xmath123 over a region of space bounded by the radius @xmath148 will receive contribution only from the boundary . taking the boundary to be the horizon with radius @xmath23 ( where @xmath25 ) with temperature @xmath149 , one can easily show that the lagrangian becomes @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 stand for the usual energy and entropy of such spacetimes but now defined purely locally near the surface @xmath23 .",
    "( note that , in the integral in we have not specified the second limit of integration and the contribution is evaluated essentially from the surface integral on the horizon . in this sense , it is purely local . )",
    "this shows that the lagrangian in this case actually corresponds to the free - energy of the spacetime even at the level of action without using the field equations .",
    "remarkably enough , this result also generalizes to all lanczos - lovelock  models with correct expressions for @xmath51 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that , in using the standard action principle in gravitational theories , we are actually extremising the free - energy of the spacetime , treated as a functional of the metric , and raises the possibility that one could write down a more direct expression for a thermodynamic functional of the spacetime ( like the entropy density , free - energy density etc .",
    "associated with local null surfaces ) and extremize it to obtain the field equations .",
    "this program actually works and i will now briefly describe how this can be achieved .",
    "in the previous sections , we examined some of the features of the gravitational theories and showed that they naturally lead to an alternative thermodynamic interpretation . for example , the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : avoholo ] were obtained by starting from the field equations of the theory , establishing that they can be expressed as a law of equipartition and thus determining the density of microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "but if these ideas are correct , it must be possible to treat spacetime as a thermodynamic system endowed with certain thermodynamic potentials .",
    "then extremising these potentials with respect to suitable variables should lead to the field equations of gravity , rather than us starting from the field equations and obtaining a thermodynamic interpretation .",
    "we will now see how this can be achieved .",
    "since any null surface can be thought of as a local rindler horizon to a suitable class of observers , any deformation a local patch of a null surface will change the amount of information accessible to these observers .",
    "it follows that such an observer will associate certain amount of entropy density with the deformation of the null patch with normal @xmath83 . so extremizing the sum of gravitational and matter entropy associated with _",
    "all _ null vector fields _ simultaneously _ , could lead to a consistency condition on the background metric which we interpret as the gravitational field equation @xcite .",
    "this idea is a natural extension of the procedure we use to determine the influence of gravity on matter in the spacetime .",
    "if we introduce freely falling observers around all events in a spacetime and demand that laws of special relativity should hold for all these observers _ simultaneously _ , we can obtain the usual , generally covariant , versions of the equations of motion obeyed by matter in a background spacetime .",
    "that is , the existence of freely falling observers around each event is spacetime can be exploited to determine the kinematics of gravity ( ` how gravity makes matter move ' ) . to determine the _ dynamics _ of gravity ( ` how matter makes spacetime curve ' ) , we use the same strategy but now by filling the spacetime with local rindler observers .",

    "while this appears to be an attractive idea , it is not easy to give it a rigorous mathematical expression consistent with what we know already know about space and time . in attempting this",
    ", we run into ( at least ) two key difficulties that need to be satisfactorily addressed .",
    "the first issue has to do with the role played by time , which is quite different from the role played by space in the description of physics .",

    "what is remarkable is the fact that both these difficulties disappear @xcite when we consider spacetime in the cosmological context !",
    "observations show that there is indeed a special choice of time variable available in our universe , which is the proper time of the geodesic observers who see the cosmic microwave background radiation as homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "this fact justifies treating time differently from space in ( and _ only _ in ) the context of cosmology .",
    "further , the spatial expansion of the universe can certainly be thought of as equivalent to the emergence of space as the cosmic time flows forward .",

    "but when we want to treat space itself as being emergent , one can not start with gravitational field equations and need to work with something more fundamental .",

    "it is therefore natural to think of the current accelerated expansion of the universe as an evolution towards holographic equipartition . treating the expansion of the universe as conceptually equivalent to the emergence of space",
    "we conclude that the emergence of space itself is being driven towards holographic equipartition .",

    "an immediate consequence of the discretised version in is that we expect significant departures from conventional evolution when the relevant degrees of freedom are of the order of unity .",
    "well - motivated modifications of this equation will help us to study the evolution of the universe close to the big bang in a quantum cosmological setting when the degrees of freedom are of order unity .",

    "postulating suitable corrections to the `` bit dynamics '' in may provide an alternate way of tackling the singularity problem of classical cosmology . * notice that , as stated , our fundamental equation , , is first order in time and links the direction of cosmic time with the expansion of hubble volume .",

    "in contrast , the bulk _ fluctuations _ lead to an energy density which is larger by a factor @xmath278 . also note that if  instead of considering the fluctuations in energy  we coherently add them , we will get @xmath279 which is @xmath280 for the bulk and @xmath281 for the surface .",

    "we find that the viable possibility to describe our universe is obtained only if we assume that ( a ) the number of active degrees of freedom in a region of size @xmath18 scales as @xmath285 and ( b)it is the _ fluctuations _ in the energy that contributes to the cosmological constant and the bulk energy does not gravitate .",
    "it is interesting to compare the holographic equipartition discussed in this section with the equipartition law discussed earlier in section  [ sec : avoholo ] for static spacetimes .",
    "both of them agree in the case of de sitter universe since the ds line element can be expressed both in static form as well as in the standard friedmann form with @xmath288 .",
    "but in a general spacetime , the motion of the observer get mixed up with the intrinsic time dependence of the geometry .",
    "one possible way of studying such a situation is as follows : consider a spacetime in which we have introduced the usual @xmath289 split with the normals to @xmath290 constant surfaces being @xmath256 which we can take to be the four - velocities of a congruence of observers .",
    "let @xmath291 be the acceleration of the congruence and @xmath292 be the extrinsic curvature tensor .",

    "using the field equations to write @xmath296 and integrating @xmath297 over a region of space , we can immediately obtain the equipartition law discussed in section  [ sec : avoholo ] .    on the other hand , in the friedmann universe , the natural observers are the geodesic observers for whom @xmath298 .",
    "for the geodesic observers , the above relation reduces to : @xmath299 further , in the friedmann universe , @xmath300 giving @xmath301 . using these values and dividing the throughout by @xmath302 , it is easy to reduce it to .",
    "we see that the surface degrees of freedom actually arises from a term of the kind @xmath303 , when one interprets @xmath304 as the relevant radius .    in a general spacetime ,",
    "if we choose a local gauge with @xmath305 , then can be reduced to the form @xmath306 where @xmath307 integrating this relation over a region of space , we can express the departure from equipartition , as seen by observers following this congruence as : @xmath308 this is an exact equation which can be used to study the evolution of the geometry in terms of the departure from equipartition for both finite and cosmological systems .",
    "( i will discuss this in detail in a future publication ) .",
    "it should , however , be stressed that  for reasons described in the beginning of this section  the idea of emergence of space is untenable in the context of finite gravitating systems treated in isolation .",
    "such systems are probably best described by the ideas presented in the earlier sections of this review .",
    "one situation in which we need to handle both the dynamics of finite gravitating systems as well as emergence of space is when we study structure formation in the universe using these ideas .",
    "it is quite straightforward to work out perturbation theory in a specific gauge using a hybrid of newtonian gravity at small scales and general relativity to describe the back ground expansion . because is identical to , we pretty much reproduce the standard results , except for the following feature .",

    "( this temperature , of course , should not be confused with the normal kinetic temperature of matter . )",
    "so the dynamics of such degrees of freedom should be studied in a canonical ensemble at this temperature and we will expect to see thermal fluctuations at the temperature @xmath310 to be imprinted on any sub - system which has achieved equipartition .",
    "this effect will lead to some corrections to the cosmological perturbation theory in the late universe when we do a thermal averaging .",
    "one will be led to equations like , with @xmath311 so that we get , for e.g. , @xmath312 .",
    "all this is similar in spirit to the thermal fluctuations at the de sitter temperature leaving their imprint on the density fluctuations generated during inflation .",
    "the formation of structures in an expanding universe also defines an arrow of time within conventional cosmology .",
    "given the fact that einstein s equations are invariant under @xmath313 , this arrow also arises due to specific choice of the initial conditions .",
    "if we succeed in understanding the structure formation from a thermodynamic perspective , there is a very good chance that we can link the arrow of time in structure formation to the cosmological arrow of time determined by background expansion .",
    "it should be stressed that these thermal effects are _ in addition to ( and not instead of ) _ any imprint of the current hubble constant @xmath314 on the cosmic structures due to standard processes of structure formation .",
    "various aspects of structure formation ( e.g. , formation of dark matter halos , cooling of baryonic gas , formation of galaxies with flat rotation curves etc . ) in the standard @xmath1cdm cosmology depend on on @xmath314 in different ways .",
    "one can take any such standard result in cosmic structure formation theory which depends on @xmath314 , and rewrite it in terms of the horizon temperature using @xmath315 , and present it in an emergent / thermodynamic language .",

    "( i chose this example because this is sometimes presented as evidence for mond , etc . which is unwarranted . )",
    "it is therefore important to distinguish between ( a ) trivial rewriting standard results in terms of the horizon temperature through @xmath315 , and ( b ) deriving genuine effects which arise due to the emergence of cosmic space and holographic equipartition .",
    "the fact that an equation like can describe the the evolution of the universe suggests that there must exist a deep relationship between the matter degrees of freedom and dark energy degrees of freedom . in the correct theory of quantum gravity",

    "but , even in the absence of such a fundamental theory , we can use our current knowledge about the universe to draw some curious conclusions .",

    "the proper wavelengths of all perturbations would have been larger than the hubble radius at sufficiently early phase of the universe which , incidentally , causes difficulties for generation of initial perturbations .",
    "a wavelength represented by label 1 will enter the hubble radius during the matter / radiation dominated phase .",
    "more relevant for us is the fact that some perturbations _ do not enter _ the hubble radius at all and remain outside the hubble radius for the entire evolution of the universe !",
    "the line marked 2 denotes the limiting wavelength of the perturbation which just skirts the hubble radius at @xmath327 .",
    "longer wavelengths remain outside the hubble radius .",
    "since we consider the hubble radius to demarcate the space that has emerged from the space yet to emerge , we should probably be interested in the modes which are inside the hubble radius during at least some phase of the evolution .",

    "while both these phases can be extended indefinitely into the past and future with constant hubble radius , there are physical processes which limit the physically relevant region within the parallelogram adcb .",
    "because of the late time acceleration , the hubble radius `` flattens out '' for @xmath326 . so all perturbations with wavelengths larger than a critical perturbation ( shown by line ab ) will never re - enter the hubble radius which we treat as the boundary of emergent space .",

    "these equalities connect up the three different phases of the universe and allows us to express the cosmological constant in terms of the @xmath0-folding factor during inflation as @xmath332 . ]",
    "it is rather remarkable that our real universe is actually a combination of both these types , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hor2 ] .",
    "it has an initial inflationary phase which end at @xmath333 and is followed by a radiation and matter dominated phases .",
    "these give way to another de sitter phase of late time accelerated expansion for @xmath326 .",
    "the first and last phases are time translation invariant ; that is , @xmath334 constant is an ( approximate ) invariance for the universe in these two phases .",
    "the universe satisfies the perfect cosmological principle and is in steady state during these phases ; these symmetries are broken during the radiation and matter dominated phase in the middle . in principle",
    ", the two de sitter phases can be of arbitrarily long duration @xcite . from this perspective",
    ", the middle phase  in which most of the cosmology is done  is of negligible measure in the span of time .",
    "it merely connects two steady state phases of the universe .",
    "such an evolution is interesting from the holographic point of view . in the initial inflationary phase , we have almost exact holographic equipartition between the bulk and surface degrees of freedom and",
    "the emergence of space is at a very small rate .",
    "( in the conventional , slow roll - over inflation @xmath335 which is quite small . )",
    "at the end of the inflation , the ground state energy density of the inflation field converts itself into radiation and we could say that the matter emerges during the reheating process .",
    "this also disturbs the holographic equipartition and the space begins to emerge along with radiation . if there is no residual ground state energy left ( that is , if there is no cosmological constant ) we will end up in a type 1 universe in which there is no hope for late time holographic equipartition .",
    "we know from observations that this is not the case and a non - zero cosmological constant survives , lies dormant through the radiation and matter dominated phases of the universe and makes its presence felt at late times .",
    "we will now describe some curious links between the two de sitter phase evolutions in our universe .      to do this , we begin by noting that  while the two de sitter phases can last forever , mathematically  there are physical cut - off length scales in both of them which makes the region of relevance to us to be finite .",
    "let us first consider the accelerating phase in the late universe . as the universe expands exponentially , the wavelength of cmbr photons will be redshifted exponentially .",
    "when the temperature of the cmbr radiation drops below the de sitter temperature ( that is , when the wavelength of the typical cmbr photon is stretched to the size of the hubble radius @xmath336 ) the universe will be dominated by the vacuum thermal noise of the de sitter phase .",
    "the universe is , of course , in approximate holographic equipartition at this phase and will now also reach normal thermodynamic equilibrium with the kinetic temperature of photons becoming equal to the de sitter temperature .",
    "this happens at the point marked c when the expansion factor is @xmath337 determined by the equation @xmath338 .",
    "if @xmath327 is the point ( marked b in the figure ) at which the cosmological constant started dominating , then @xmath339 .",
    "using these results we find that the range of bc is @xmath340 since the universe would be dominated by de sitter vacuum noise beyond c , it seem reasonable to consider @xmath341 to be the physically relevant range in the late time accelerating phase .",
    "it turns out a natural bound exists for the physically relevant duration of inflation in any universe _ which has a late time accelerating phase_. we saw that , if there is no late time acceleration , then _ all _ wavelengths will re - enter the hubble radius sooner or later .",
    "but if the universe enters an accelerated expansion at late times , then the hubble radius flattens out and some of the perturbations will _ never _ re - enter the hubble radius . the limiting perturbation which just makes it into the hubble radius as the universe enters accelerated phase of expansion phase is shown by the line marked ab in figure [ fig : hor2 ] . again",
    "since the hubble radius is treated as the boundary of the space that has emerged , it makes sense to consider this as a physical cut - off during the inflationary phase .",
    "this portion of the inflationary regime is marked by ad and its range is : @xmath342 where @xmath343 is the reheating temperature after inflation .",
    "normally , for a guts scale inflation with @xmath344 we have @xmath345 .",
    "but in the context of our approach , it is more meaningful to consider a planck scale inflation so that we can actually think of space emerging from a planck scale hubble radius",
    ". then @xmath346 , and we get the remarkable result that the ad and bc are equal !",
    "@xmath347 the above result also holds  as can be easily verified  if we think of the point @xmath348 as defined by the epoch at which the energy density of _ radiation _ rather than matter is equal to the energy density in cosmological constant .",
    "this will just change the factor @xmath349 by @xmath350 in both and in the first equality of ; these factors cancel out when we obtain .",
    "what is more interesting is that if we treat db as the hubble radius during a radiation dominated epoch , so that @xmath351 , then we also have the result @xmath352 this is very easy to see from the geometrical fact that while ab is a line of unit slope , db is a line of slope 2 . in the real universe",
    "the entire range of db is not radiation dominated because a small part near b is matter dominated .",
    "for the standard parameters of our universe , the radiation dominated phase occurs when the universe cools from the re - heating temperature ( which we take to be @xmath353 gev in the diagram ) till about 1 ev . during this phase ,",
    "the universe expands by about a factor @xmath354 . on the other hand",
    ", the universe expands only by a factor of about @xmath355 during the matter dominated phase . for the purpose of illustrating the overall picture , we have ignored the matter dominated phase in fig .",
    "[ fig : hor2 ] .",
    "( the description of the universe in terms of these three phases was attempted earlier by bjorken  @xcite in a completely different context . )",
    "a more precise calculation changes the diagram slightly .",
    "clearly , there is very definitive relationship between the cosmological constant and matter degrees of freedom , which leads to .",
    "in fact , one can give a more direct interpretation to the equality in .",
    "note that the modes which exit the hubble radius during ad re - enter the hubble radius during db and again exit during bc .",
    "we would like to think of these modes as closely related to the physical degrees of freedom emerging with space in the inflationary phase , _",
    "because for us hubble radius is the edge of the space that has emerged_. let us therefore calculate the total number of modes which cross the hubble radius in the interval @xmath356 or , more conveniently , when the expansion factor is in the range @xmath357 .",
    "since the number of modes in the _ comoving _ hubble volume @xmath358 is given by the integral of @xmath359 we need to compute the integral over the relevant range of @xmath360 . we know that the condition fro horizon crossing is @xmath361 so that in the de sitter phase with constant @xmath48 we have @xmath362 . in the radiation dominated phase @xmath363 , so again @xmath364 .",
    "( we can ignore the minus sign which merely tells us that the mode which exits last , enters first etc . )",
    "therefore the total number of modes which cross the hubble radius during @xmath365 is given by : @xmath366 in all the three phases if we ignore matter .",
    "this allows us to write : @xmath367 \\label{nofa}\\ ] ] where @xmath368 is the number of modes which cross the hubble radius in the interval @xmath357 and @xmath369 is numerical factor of order unity which is @xmath370 in the de sitter and radiation phases . so the equality of ratios in translates to the equality of the degrees of freedom , considered as the number of modes in a hubble volume which crosses the hubble radius .",
    "that is we have : @xmath371 this possibly provides an alternative way of understanding the equality of the three different phases of our universe .",
    "the description of the universe in the last two sections provide an appealing first principle approach towards cosmology , different from the standard one .",
    "this approach is capable of reproducing the usual features of the universe and the evolutionary history because the scale factor is governed by the standard equations of the friedmann model .",
    "in addition , this approach provides a new vision which holds promise for understanding many key issues in a unified manner .",
    "let me conclude this review describing this broader pricture .",
    "the notion that increase in the hubble radius represents the emergence of space is fundamental to this approach . a static universe in this picture is represented by a universe with constant hubble radius rather than by a universe with a time independent expansion factor .",
    "( historically , this was the original motivation for the steady state universe because an expansion factor @xmath372 is invariant under time translation ; this is precisely the de sitter universe with constant hubble radius . )    with such a concept for emergence of space , it seems natural to begin with an evolutionary epoch in which the hubble radius is of the order of planck length .",
    "this is definitely in the quantum gravitational domain in which our lack of knowledge of pre - geometric variables prevent us from providing a precise mathematical description .",
    "we assume that some quantum gravitational instability triggers the universe to make a transition from this state to another one which is again of constant hubble radius that is significantly larger .",
    "this transition occurs along with the emergence of considerable amount of space and matter  originally  in the form of radiation . during this phase",
    ", the universe essentially evolves as a radiation dominated friedmann model .",
    "the precise description of the transition between the two de sitter phases is the standard domain of conventional cosmology in which , depending on the dynamics of the matter sector , one will have a radiation dominated phase giving way to a very late time matter dominated phase .",
    "it is , however , obvious that in the overall cosmological evolution matter dominated phase is not of much significance since it again quickly gives way to the second de sitter phase dominated by the cosmological constant .",
    "viewed in this manner , the domain of conventional cosmology merely describes the emergence of matter degrees of freedom along with cosmic space during the time the universe is making a transition from one de sitter phase to another .",
    "[ one is reminded of the description that chicken is just one egg s way of producing another egg !",
    "the radiation dominated phase is just a transient connection between two de sitter phases . ]",
    "as i have already remarked , such a universe with two de sitter phases has its relevant cosmology contained in three separate epochs , each of equal duration in which the expansion factor increases by @xmath373 . during the first phase of expansion by @xmath374 ,",
    "the perturbations generated in the planck scale inflation ( to use a conventional terminology , though i am not sure inflation is the correct word to describe this planck scale process ) leave the hubble radius . during the second phase of expansion by @xmath374 , these perturbations re - enter the hubble radius , mostly during the radiation dominated phase and a little bit during the matter dominated phase at the end which",
    ", as i said before , is a minor detail and of doubtful cosmic significance . during the third phase of expansion by @xmath374 , these perturbations again",
    "leave the hubble radius . during this time",
    ", the radiation temperature drops below the hubble temperature of the cosmological constant . once this happens the universe",
    "is completely dominated by vacuum noise and is in an asymptotic steady state .",
    "the entire evolution during the second and third phase can be completely described as that of a system which is evolving towards holographic equipartition .",
    "the tendency of the universe to achieve @xmath375 is what drives the cosmic evolution .",
    "such a perfect state did exist during the initial planck scale phase as well .",
    "the question as to why it was unstable and made a transition to radiation dominated phase probably can be answered only when we understand the pre - geometric planck scale physics .",
    "however , it should be stressed that there has been several quantum cosmological models in which `` the creation of the universe '' is linked to quantum gravitational instabilities .",
    "therefore i do not consider this as a serious difficulty for this scenario .    in a way",
    ", the problem of the cosmos has now been reduced to understanding one single number @xmath2 closely related to the number of modes which cross the hubble radius during the three phases of the evolution .",
    "this , in turn , will be related to the total number of matter degrees of freedom which emerge from the pre - geometric variables along with space .",
    "the conventional question of why @xmath376 is approximately @xmath377 is answered in this approach by linking it to @xmath378 .",
