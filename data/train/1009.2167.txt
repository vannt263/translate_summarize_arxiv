    "singlet superconductivity and ferromagnetism do not usually coexist in bulk compounds , as the exchange field in the ferromagnet favors an alignment of the conduction electron spins in the same direction , preventing the pairing effect in cooper - pairs formed by electrons with anti - parallel spin .",
    "however , the combination of superconducting ( s ) and ferromagnetic ( f ) materials in artificial thin layered systems , gives the unique opportunity to investigate the interplay between these two competing long - range order phenomena .",
    "in such sf hybrid devices , superconducting correlations may be established in the ferromagnet due to the proximity effect , allowing superconductivity and ferromagnetism to coexist within a short distance from the interface of the order of the induced superconducting correlation length , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the exchange field causes pair breaking in the superconductor , weakening or even suppressing the superconducting order parameter , and inducing a local magnetic moment in the superconductor at a distance from the sf interface set by the superconducting coherence length @xmath10 .",
    "magnetic ordering is generally more robust than superconductivity ( the exchange energy in ferromagnets is typically  1 ev , while the cooper pair formation energy is  0.01 ev ) , and for materials having a strong exchange field , magnetism may be unperturbed by the proximity of a superconductor .",
    "while sf hybrid structures based on metallic ferromagnets and conventional superconductors have been investigated in detail@xcite , there are much less studies on sf systems involving high - transition temperature cuprate superconductors characterized by a very short coherence length and an anisotropic superconducting gap . in this context ,",
    "half metallic rare earth manganites like la@xmath0m@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( m = ca , sr , ba ) are ideal ferromagnets , as they are nearly perfectly in - plane lattice matched with cuprates , which enables heteroepitaxial growth of cuprate / manganite sf bilayers and superlattices with well defined interfaces @xcite .",
    "in particular , yba@xmath3cu@xmath2o@xmath4/la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( ybco / lcmo ) superlattices have allowed the study of novel phenomena , such as a long range proximity effect@xcite , spin polarized quasiparticle injection into the s layer within a spin diffusion length @xmath11 @xcite , giant magnetoresistance@xcite and a giant modulation of the f - layer magnetization induced by superconductivity@xcite .",
    "recently , interfacial properties in ybco / lcmo superlattices were investigated by x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd)@xcite and x - ray linear dichroism ( xld)@xcite . these studies revealed an induced ferromagnetic moment on the interfacial cu , oriented antiparallel to the adjacent mn , whose temperature dependence follows that of the mn moment .",
    "the authors suggest that cu and mn are coupled across the interface by covalent chemical bonding that results in strong hybridization and large rearrangements of the orbital occupancies ( orbital `` reconstruction '' ) . within this context",
    ", the mn - o - cu superexchange interaction explains the induced magnetic moment in the cuprate and the presence of a non - superconducting ybco layer at the interface .    here , we present a detailed investigation of ybco / lcmo bilayers , focusing on the dependence of transport properties on the ybco layer thickness as well as on the interface coupling on an atomic length scale .",

    "dichroism measurements with linearly polarized light show no evidence of any significant difference between the 3@xmath13 orbital occupations in the interfacial cu as compared to the cu in the bulk ybco .",
    "this implies that an induced magnetic moment on cu through hybridization at the interface with mn can result _ without _ any accompanying `` orbital reconstruction '' .",
