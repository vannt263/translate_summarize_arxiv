    "analytical estimates suggest that particle production from decaying strings ( or , in two dimensions : domain walls ) is suppressed by the separation of cosmological ( @xmath1 ) and microscopic ( @xmath2 ) scales .",
    "the former is the curvature scale of the string , assumed to be of order the hubble radius , and the latter is determined by the underlying particle physics , typically on the gut scale .",
    "particle production would mean transforming the energy in the deep infrared into ultraviolet excitations , over something like 58 orders of magnitude in momentum scale .",

    "once one takes into account the gravitational channel a simple estimate gives @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the plack mass @xcite , which therefore seems to be dominant for sufficiently large @xmath1 .    numerical analysis of the nambu - goto action confirms @xcite the analytical scaling assumption @xcite that implies a string density @xmath7 ( in @xmath8 space dimensions ) , at least for strings as long as the horizon size .",
    "an exact minkowski space simulation of a string network reveals that fragmentation to loops is the dominant decay process @xcite , which proceeds down to the smallest scale on the network , which may even be the microscopic scale of the string width @xcite .",
    "simulations in an expanding universe @xcite broadly confirm this picture , although indicate that the relevant small scale is the initial correlation length @xcite    however , for strings which are topological defects , we can check this picture by solving the underlying field theory in the classical approximation .",
    "this means in practice to integrate the non - linear wave equations on a spatial lattice and to average over an initial ensemble .",
    "this approach offers a full insight into all non - perturbative phenomena , although it may be difficult to justify the omission of quantum effects at the microscopic scale .",
    "nevertheless , this method has been successfully used elsewhere , e.g. to explore the dynamics of symmetry breaking @xcite , or of non - thermal phase transitions @xcite in the post - inflationary universe .",
    "the scaling behaviour suggested by nambu - goto simulations is manifest in the classical field dynamics , even though only the microscopic scale appears in the equation of motion .",
    "it has been demonstrated in the context of gauge strings in the abelian higgs model @xcite global strings @xcite , non - abelian global strings with junctions @xcite , and semilocal strings @xcite , as well as domain walls @xcite , including models with junctions @xcite .",
    "the scaling is present in minkowski as well as expanding space time , and in two as well as three dimensions .",
    "it seems to be a universal feature of classical field theories with extended structures .    for strings ,",
    "a major difference between the numerical solutions of the classical field dynamics and nambu - goto simulations is that defects decay into classical radiation @xcite , at a much faster rate than anticipated from perturbation theory and cusp annihilation .",
    "one typically observes a length of string @xmath1 in a volume @xmath9 , and hence that the string length density is @xmath10 .",
    "given a mass per unit length of @xmath11 , the energy density in string is @xmath12 . since scaling implies @xmath13 , the energy loss rate per unit length @xmath14 .",
    "hence , for a loop of size @xmath1 , the average energy loss rate is @xmath15 , which is , in fact , greater than the gravitational estimate .",
    "we discover then that the classical scaling implies a strong radiative decay .",
    "this is very puzzling in view of the scale separation between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 which grows as the simulation proceeds .",
    "however , apart from confirming the scaling over more than three orders of magnitude , it is not our purpose to address this important question .",
    "instead we note that up to now it has been unclear if the classical approach is valid here , where dynamics is driven by an interplay between macroscopic and microscopic scales .",
    "a check for quantum corrections is crucial .",
    "an alternative to the classical approach is the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action technique , which is based on a selective resummation of perturbative diagrams @xcite . preheating dynamics with non - perturbative particle production @xcite and particle thermalisation by scattering @xcite are within the range of its applicability .",
    "the so far used homogeneous version of this elaborate technique is , however , incapable of addressing the question of defect formation @xcite .",
    "we can combine these techniques , using the classical approach to form defects and then studying their evolution in the 2pi framework .",
    "if we keep the next - to - leading order diagrams in the 2pi effective action , we will gain insight into the scattering and thermalisation of the produced particles .",
    "the inhomogeneous variant of the 2pi equations , however , is technically hardly feasible . keeping the lowest order 2pi diagram yields an approximation scheme , that is equivalent to the well - known hartree approximation @xcite .",
    "while scattering between the produced particles is not included here , even the homogeneous version of this scheme could account for the non - perturbatively rapid particle production in the early universe @xcite .",
    "the extension of the equations to inhomogeneous backgrounds was historically motivated by the hope that the background field could mediate interaction between the freely streaming particles .",
    "although numerics have shown that the opposite was true @xcite , this method can be still used for finding the leading quantum corrections to the evolution of classical structures , as has been suggested by a one - dimensional analysis of moving kings @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the classical solution of the @xmath16 theory in two space dimensions corrected by the hartree approximation . in the broken phase this toy model features domain walls , which resemble strings in this low dimensional setting .",
    "we check if there is a significant alteration to the kink dynamics by the inclusion of this type of quantum correction .",

    "its simplest explanation is that there are classically stable small structures that decay in a quantum field theory .",
    "now we can speculate what these could be .",
    "natural candidates are oscillons , localised oscillating wave packets , which are ( quasi-)stable solutions of the classical field theory @xcite .",
    "if these small structures are indeed oscillons , their stability is enhanced by low dimensionality .",
    "if in three dimensions they are subject to a more rapid decay @xcite , making the quantum decay channel less significant and hence the quantum correction to the scaling even smaller .    indeed , a closer look on the lattice field revealed that there are small regions ( with a diameter of o(5 ) domain wall width ) that oscillate with a frequency @xmath122 .",
    "but oscillons are not the only structures that appear .",
    "the shrinking and collapsing domain walls emit classical waves with a wave length @xmath116 .",
    "we see these waves on the lattice snapshots as circular ripples .",
    "these ripples from various sources interfere and at the points of constructive interference the field value may locally exceed zero and will then be counted as a small domain .",
    "classical waves are emitted in the quantum field theory , too . in quantum mechanics",
    "this classical excitation is known as coherent state , which transforms into an enlarged width of the wave function , or into particles in field theory language .",
    "this is the point where quantum corrections enter : the classical waves are damped and their interference results in fewer and less stable localised oscillating wave packets .    in this picture",
    "there is a non - perturbative classical mechanism that converts the energy stored in the string ( or domain wall ) to microscopic objects . in a field theory , these objects are neither loop fragments , nor particles , but coherent oscillations of the field expectation value .",
    "our numerics suggests that the scale of these classical waves are on the microscopic scale @xmath2 .",
    "we observe that these waves are emitted from structures of size @xmath1 , presenting us with the challenge of explaining energy transport over a huge scale separation , @xmath123 at the end the simulation .",
    "it is clear from the shown numerics that the domain wall decay was not enhanced by the quantum fluctuations and this conclusion we checked to stay true with @xmath124 or @xmath125 .",
    "there is no indication for a direct decay channel into particles .",
    "a direct decay might also manifest in the sensitivity to the choice of the lattice spacing as we switched between @xmath26 and @xmath126 , but we found no significant difference .",
    "however , the decay of the classical waves and oscillons is no longer protected by scale separation .",
    "finally , let us attempt to understand fig .",
    "[ fig : number ] .",
    "the energy density associated to macroscopic @xmath127-dimensional defects in @xmath70 dimensions is @xmath128 . their decay releases energy at a rate of @xmath129 .",
    "this energy is used to produce high amplitude classical structures ( e.g. oscillons ) that may have been counted as small domains .",
    "since they emerge on the microscopic scale , their number density has a source of @xmath130 , where @xmath131 and the other constants we introduce here are dimensionless numbers of @xmath132 .",
    "these small structures can decay in various ways : a ) in the quantum calculation we include the direct quantum mechanical decay into particles with a rate of @xmath133 ; b ) the small objects can be hit by a domain wall or string , its rate is proportional to the defect density : @xmath134 ; c ) these objects can also hit each other and annihilate .",
    "the probability of a given small object to meet an other one is proportional to its density @xmath54 , which gives a rate of @xmath135 .",
    "these together give the following equation for the density @xmath54 @xmath136 if the quantum decay into particles dominates giving a finite life time to these small classical structures , the density @xmath54 simply follows the source .",
    "indeed we see @xmath137 in fig .",
    "[ fig : number ] . in the absence of @xmath138 , however , we find that @xmath139 solves eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsmall ] ) in consistence with our observation .",
    "since in this case @xmath54 shows the same scaling as the domain wall density , counting them as defects does not spoil the observation of scaling .",
    "the classical approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsmall ] ) suggests that for @xmath140 the collision term would dominate , giving @xmath141 . in higher dimensions ,",
    "however , oscillons and other analogous structures are less stable , which introduces a decay term of classical nature bluring difference between classical and quantum scaling .",
    "in this paper we integrated the classical field equations as well as the hartree approximated quantum evolution of a scalar field in the broken phase , starting from a network of domain walls .",
    "the scaling of macroscopic observables was manifest also in the quantum theory .",
    "our numerical results suggest that the direct decay of domain walls into particles is insignificant , as the perturbative estimates predict .",
    "we can instead attribute the decay to the emergence of classical waves and other structures , such as oscillons . since these coherent excitations of the quantum field theory are produced at the microscopic scale , their perturbative decay is no longer suppressed by the separation of scales .",
    "the production of large - amplitude classical oscillations is a genuine non - perturbative phenomenon that deserves further investigation , as a similar effect is seen to drive the decay of cosmic strings in three dimensional field theory simulations @xcite . understanding the dominant decay channel of strings is of crucial importance for computing their observational signals .",
    "the authors thank jrgen berges and anders tranberg for the encouraging discussions and also acknowledge the collaboration with petja salmi on a related project .",
