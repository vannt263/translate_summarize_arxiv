    "glasses are structurally disordered systems . as common experience shows , in the macroscopic limit they support sound waves as the corresponding crystalline materials do .",
    "in fact , averaging on a length - scale large enough , the details of the microscopic arrangement become essentially irrelevant .",
    "this holds true for sound waves with long wavelengths of at least several hundreds of nanometers , corresponding to wavenumbers , @xmath1 , in the 10@xmath2 nm@xmath3 range , as those probed with light scattering techniques  @xcite . on further increasing @xmath1 ,",
    "the effect of the structural disorder must at one point appear .",
    "the much larger @xmath1-scale of few nm@xmath3 is also well known , since it can be accessed experimentally with inelastic x - ray  @xcite and neutron  @xcite scattering techniques , and numerically with molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "these studies typically probe the dynamic structure factor , @xmath4 , that is the space and time fourier transform of the density - density correlation function .",
    "they clearly indicate the existence in glasses of excitations that appear in those spectra as very broad peaks whose position as a function of @xmath1 is characterized by a sinusoidal - like dispersion curve .",
    "thus , these excitations strongly recall the acoustic modes in ( poly-)crystalline systems up to roughly one half of the pseudo brillouin zone  @xcite , i.e. down to distances corresponding to the interatomic spacing . for this reason ,",
    "they are often dubbed as acoustic - like . however , as their broadening clearly indicates , they are far from being crystal - like modes and correspond in fact to a complex pattern of atomic motions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , experimental and numerical studies leave a gap between the few nanometers scale and the hundreds of nanometers one that is extremely difficult to access .",
    "this keeps still open a number of fundamental questions in the physics of glasses and , more in general , on the nature of the vibrational excitations in disordered systems . _",
    "i ) _ how does the transition for the acoustic - like excitations look like between the small-@xmath1 debye - like behaviour and the large-@xmath1 regime ?",
    "in other words , how does it happen that reasonably well defined plane waves transform , on increasing @xmath1 , into a complex pattern of atomic motions that mirror the structural disorder ?",
    "_ ii ) _ similarly to crystalline systems , glasses are characterized by a universal behaviour in some fundamental low - temperature observables like specific heat and thermal conductivity  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in the @xmath010  k range the specific heat shows an excess with respect to the @xmath5 , debye - model prediction and the thermal conductivity shows a plateau . despite of a longstanding debate  @xcite , their origin is still poorly understood .",
    "it is however generally accepted that they are related to the ubiquitous existence at frequencies of @xmath01  thz of an excess of modes in the vibrational density of states , @xmath6 , over the debye - model prediction @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the debye frequency .",
    "this excess of modes is best visible in the reduced density of states , @xmath9 , where it appears as a broad feature known as boson peak  @xcite . is then this universal behaviour in the low - temperature thermal properties or in the vibrational density of states related to the peculiar nature of the acoustic - like excitations in the low - frequency range ? or , alternatively , do we have to imagine that glasses are characterized by additional low - frequency modes ? _",
    "iii ) _ what is the information content that we can extract from the high-@xmath1 acoustic - like excitations measured in inelastic scattering experiments or calculated numerically ?",
    "in which physical properties are their crystal - like features ( e.g. existence of dispersion curves ) reflected ?",
    "the experiments that have attempted to answer these questions accessing the difficult 10@xmath21  nm@xmath3 @xmath1-range lead to contrasting interpretations .",
    "an experiment based on a tunnel junction technique reported  @xcite linear dispersion for the transverse acoustic excitations in a silica glass up to frequencies 50% smaller than the boson peak position in that glass ( @xmath01  thz ) .",
    "this result indicated that the acoustic excitations are unaffected in the frequency range relevant for the thermal properties in the @xmath010  k range , and seemed to exclude any acoustic contribution to the low - temperature anomalies in the specific heat of glasses  @xcite .",
    "early inelastic x - ray scattering results  @xcite seemed to confirm that scenario and showed crystal - like dispersing high - frequency longitudinal acoustic - like excitations with a broadening increasing quadratically with the frequency .",
    "again , a simple linear dispersion of the longitudinal acoustic - like modes was observed at frequencies corresponding to the boson peak position , thus suggesting a smooth transition between the macroscopic and microscopic regime .",
    "recent and more accurate inelastic x - ray scattering studies have however revealed that the boson peak marks the energy where a qualitative change takes place : the longitudinal acoustic - like excitations show , below the boson peak position , a marked decrease of the phase velocity  @xcite and a broadening characterized by a remarkable fourth - power - law frequency dependence  @xcite .",
    "a similar behaviour for the broadening of the transverse acoustic modes had been found in a silica glass at low temperature and at frequencies below the boson peak position using a tunnel junction technique  @xcite .",
    "conversely , a recent experiment using inelastic ultraviolet light scattering to measure the longitudinal acoustic modes in a silica glass at room temperature reported the onset of this peculiar @xmath10 regime at frequencies one order of magnitude smaller than the boson peak position  @xcite : the boson peak would then be not directly related to this regime .",
    "a complex and sometimes contradictory picture seems therefore to come out of the experiments performed so far .",
    "classical molecular dynamics simulations have provided a complementary tool to study the vibrational properties of glasses , starting from the pioneering investigations of rahman and coworkers  @xcite . the body of results available until now supports a scenario where the longitudinal acoustic - like excitations seem to be largely decoupled from the boson peak : they show a linear dispersion and a broadening that grows quadratically with frequency with no special feature in the frequency region where the boson peak appears  @xcite .",
    "however , these studies could not provide a final answer on this issue due to the fact that the largest wavelengths that could be studied so far  fixed by the simulation box size and then ultimately by computer power  were still in the range of few tens of interatomic spacings . as a consequence ,",
    "the corresponding lowest frequency acoustic - like excitations that were accessible lied too close to the boson peak position to allow for definite conclusions in this supposingly crucial frequency range .",
    "we report here on a study of the vibrational dynamics of the classical lennard - jones ( lj ) monatomic glass model  @xcite .",
    "the reason of our choice is simple : despite of the fact that this system easily crystallizes below the melting temperature and thus requires extremely fast and experimentally out of reach quenching rates in order to prepare a glass starting from the melt , it is the simplest realization of a structural glass at our disposal .",
    "it thus provides the very basic ingredients of the vibrational dynamics of a structural glass that in other systems might be superimposed to additional more complex effects .",
    "specifically , we present here results for an exceptionally large simulation box containing up to @xmath11=10@xmath12 particles and clarify how the acoustic modes look like in the frequency region where the boson peak appears . in particular",
    ", we managed to probe acoustic excitations down to frequencies one order of magnitude lower than the boson peak position .",
    "thanks to that , the study of their @xmath1-dependence allows us to establish that the boson peak originates from a deformation of the dispersion curves with respect to the crystal case .",
    "this boils down to a direct connection between the boson peak and the breakdown of the debye continuum approximation for the acoustic excitations that takes place on a length - scale matching that of the medium range order of the glass  @xcite .",

    "it is interesting to observe that below that frequency the macroscopic @xmath300 sound velocity limit is not directly recovered : instead a previously unnoticed region where the phase velocity decreases with increasing frequency ( softening ) appears .",
    "this is exactly the region where the boson peak is found in this lj glass ( see fig .",
    "4b below ) .",
    "the boson peak then appears not in a frequency range where the acoustic - like excitations disperse linearly ( constant phase velocity ) , at odds with what was previously thought  @xcite , but where they experience a more complex dispersion behaviour .",
    "this is important because it clarifies that the debye continuum approximation for the acoustic excitations breaks down at frequencies comparable to the boson peak position , i.e. at frequencies much lower than previously expected .",
    "complementary information on this issue can be found in fig .  2b , where the frequency - dependence of the broadening , @xmath39 , of the transverse acoustic - like excitations is presented .",
    "these data clearly show two different regimes : a @xmath40 regime at high - frequencies , as already known from previous studies and associated to the structural disorder of the glass  @xcite , and a previously unnoticed @xmath10 regime at low frequencies .",

    "the similarity with the behaviour of the transverse data suggests a common origin for both .",
    "indeed , the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities in an isotropic elastic medium are simply related by the expression : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mass density and @xmath43 is the bulk modulus .",

    "3a ( red circles ) .",
    "the good correspondence between the two sets of longitudinal velocity data derived directly from @xmath14 or from @xmath13 via eq .

    "3b between the broadening of the longitudinal acoustic - like excitations ( blue squares , left axis ) and that of the transverse ones ( red circles , right axis ) .",
    "it is clear here that these two quantities , within error - bars , can be scaled one on top of the other .",
    "this confirms that , within the accuracy of our calculation , the frequency dependence that characterizes the longitudinal acoustic - like excitations comes into play through the shear component of the longitudinal response , while the bulk component is a mere spectator .",
    "the observation of the @xmath10 regime at low frequency in the acoustic attenuation for both polarizations is an interesting result and is predicted by several models  @xcite .",
    "the simplest one can be formulated in terms of rayleigh scattering of the acoustic excitations from some kind of structural disorder  @xcite . in order to make this argument",
    "quantitative one needs to identify the scattering units that produce it , a difficult task that has lead to different conclusions  @xcite .",
    "other approaches include a description of the disorder in terms of a continuum model with randomly fluctuating transverse elastic constants  @xcite , or of lattice models with disorder in the elastic constants  @xcite . on this basis",
    ", it has been quite puzzling not to observe this strong scattering regime in previous molecular dynamics studies  @xcite .",
    "it has for example been argued that , in contrast with lattice based models , this feature would be absent in realistic glasses due to their intrinsic high level of frustration ( large internal stress )  @xcite .",
    "the present results solve the issue , clarifying that a strong scattering regime is present in fact in realistic structural glasses also , in agreement with a number of theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite results .",
    "we believe that the reason why this regime got unnoticed before has to do with the fact that , beside the obvious cases of too small simulation boxes , the attention was usually focused on the longitudinal excitations ( the only ones experimentally accessible ) where this regime is difficult to study in detail even with a box as large as the one used here , see fig .  3b .",
    "the present results in fact clarify that the signature of strong scattering appears for both polarizations at the same frequency which implies that  as the longitudinal speed of sound is larger than the transverse one ( by a factor 2.3 in the present case )  the strong scattering regime appears for the longitudinal polarization at lower @xmath1 s than for the transverse one : its observation is then definitively less favorable for the longitudinal polarization .",

    "the agreement between the two calculations is good  note that there is no adjustable parameter in this comparison .",
    "this implies that the density of states , up to the boson peak , is well described by the low-@xmath1 inflection observed in fig .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    more in general , the present results clearly show that the macroscopic and microscopic regimes for the acoustic - like excitations are connected by a crossover region where the acoustic - like dispersion curves show a considerable deformation with respect to a simple linear dependence : the sound velocities decrease with increasing frequency thus directly testifying the existence of an abrupt breakdown of the debye approximation in glasses  @xcite .",
    "this comes together with the signature of strong scattering for the acoustic - like excitations across which reasonably well defined plane waves transform into a complex pattern of atomic vibrations .",
    "the connection to the boson peak is also clear : a softening of the transverse and longitudinal sound velocities implies an excess in the reduced vibrational density of states above the debye level . since this softening directly appears in the range where the boson peak is observed , or at the corresponding temperatures where the excess in the specific heat universally appears in glasses  @xcite",
    ", we can conclude that these anomalies must have an acoustic contribution . in the following",
    "we make this connection quantitative .    in order to gain further insight into these molecular dynamics results",
    ", we performed a standard normal modes analysis of the glass in its inherent structures , i.e. we have diagonalized the dynamical matrix calculated in local minima of the potential energy landscape and derived eigenvalues and eigenstates .",

    "4b ( circles ) .",
    "4a corresponds to a pseudo - dispersion curve : it is not formally a dispersion curve but only an approximate one since in a disordered system @xmath1 is not a good quantum number , though one can still imagine that it is a reasonable mean to count the modes of low enough frequency .",
    "this pseudo - dispersion curve must have a slope for @xmath490 that corresponds to the transverse velocity .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "4a , this slope well corresponds to the @xmath490 limit of the transverse velocity ( dashed line ) derived from fig .  2 .",
    "on increasing @xmath1 , the data in fig .",
    "4a show an early departure from linearity and a clear inflection at @xmath50  2 which is the frequency where the boson peak appears ( fig .",
    "this inflection has been interpreted in terms of the failure of the classical born approximation for the description of the continuum elasticity in disordered systems  @xcite .",
    "it appears at the same frequency where the molecular dynamics results for the phase velocities in fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 show a softening .",
    "this is not surprising as the acoustic - like frequencies can indeed be regarded as average values over a distribution of eigenvalues related to the broadening of the brillouin peaks . in other words ,",
    "the velocity decrease observed at frequencies around the boson peak position in the acoustic - like excitations of transverse polarization ( fig .",
    "2a ) and , through the shear component of the longitudinal modulus , in those of longitudinal polarization ( fig .",
    "3a ) , directly reflects an inflection that appears in the @xmath1-dependence of the low-@xmath1 transverse eigenvalues .",
    "as far as we can consider @xmath1 a reasonable quantum number , it is easy to directly estimate the vibrational density of states starting from the knowledge of the dispersion curves . in a simple plane - wave approach : @xmath51 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq & \\frac{3}{q_d^3 } \\bigl(\\frac{c_t}{c_d}\\bigr)^3   \\bigl(\\frac{q^2}{\\omega^2 } \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial \\omega } \\bigr)_t ,   \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath20 stand for the longitudinal and transverse polarization , and",
    "@xmath53 is the debye velocity .",
    "the approximation in eq .",
    "3 is justified by the fact that the longitudinal contribution to the total vibrational density of states is small since it scales with @xmath54=4% .",
    "it is clear that in order to follow this approach we shall use the pseudo - dispersion curve obtained from the normal modes analysis since in that case the low - frequency eigenvalues are reasonably close to being plane waves . in order to compute eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] , instead of directly differentiating the dispersion curve , we choose to use an empirical model to fit the simulation data ( full line through the points in fig .",
    "4a ) and then to differentiate the model function .",
    "the result of this calculation is shown in fig .",
    "4b ( full line ) and , as it can be appreciated , it well describes the boson peak .",
    "it is worth underlining that no additional input but the knowledge of the dispersion curve is required to perform this calculation .",

    "this limit corresponds to the frequency where the decay time of the acoustic - like excitations first matches half of the corresponding oscillation period , and therefore marks somehow an extreme upper bound in frequency for the validity of a plane - waves approach as a starting point to describe the acoustic - like excitations . as shown in fig .  5",
    ", the present data confirm that the ioffe - regel limit for the transverse excitations is located close to the boson peak position  @xcite .",
    "5 also shows that the ioffe - regel limit is reached at different frequencies for the longitudinal and transverse excitations , and that the longitudinal one shows up at a frequency higher than the boson peak position  @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to underline that this last result seems not to be general : in a simulation study of a silica glass the ioffe - regel crossover was found to appear at the same frequency for both polarizations  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the ioffe - regel limit for the transverse excitations and the boson peak  @xcite is clarified by the discussion above , which shows that this limit is reached in fact in the frequency range where the continuum approximation for the acoustic excitations breaks down .",
    "summing up , the present simulation results shed new light on the well known universal anomaly observed in the specific heat of glasses in the @xmath56  10  k temperature range and related to the boson peak in the vibrational density of states at frequencies of @xmath01  thz .",
    "we have shown that in glasses the elastic continuum approximation for the acoustic - like excitations breaks down abruptly on the mesoscopic , medium - range - order length - scale of about ten interatomic spacings , where it still works well for the corresponding crystalline systems .",
    "this breakdown is signaled by a deformation of the pseudo - dispersion curve and corresponds to a marked reduction of the sound velocity on the mesoscopic scale .",
    "this turns out to be the closely related to the aforementioned anomalies in the specific heat and vibrational density of states , that can be finally traced back onto elastic properties specific to glasses .",
    "finally , in order to put the present results in some perspective and in connection with experiments , it is important to emphasize once more that they refer to a simple monatomic lj glass quenched with a cooling rate out of reach experimentally  in other words there is no experimental analogue of the glass studied here .",
    "still , we believe that such a simple model system has the great advantage of clearly grasping fundamental features that  though observed in bits and pieces in many experiments  are often hidden by a number of additional effects in real glasses . this ",
    "we believe  is the reason why the vibrational properties of glasses are still a debated issue after several decades of studies and discussions .",
    "for example , the high - frequency vibrational dynamics of the lj monatomic glass has been proven to be well described within the harmonic approximation  @xcite . however ,",
    "clearly real glasses are anharmonic systems  in what cases will anharmonicity start to play a role there ?",
    "moreover , differently from the investigated model , real glasses are often characterized by the presence of intramolecular or optic - like modes  this issue is of course ( and on purpose ) completely disregarded here .",

    "<S> related universal anomalies also appear in the low - frequency vibrational density of states and , despite of a longstanding debate , still remain poorly understood . using molecular dynamics simulations of a model monatomic glass of extremely large size , we show that in glasses the structural disorder undermines the debye model in a subtle way : the elastic continuum approximation for the acoustic excitations breaks down abruptly on the mesoscopic , medium - range - order length - scale of about ten interatomic spacings , where it still works well for the corresponding crystalline systems . on this scale , </S>",
    "<S> the sound velocity shows a marked reduction with respect to the macroscopic value . </S>",
    "<S> this turns out to be closely related to the universal excess over the debye model prediction found in glasses at frequencies of @xmath01  thz in the vibrational density of states or at temperatures of @xmath010  k in the specific heat . </S>"
