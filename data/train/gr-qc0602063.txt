    "understanding localized matter distributions in astrophysics , cosmology , and relativity has always been a matter of interest since the beginning of general relativity . recognizing the difficulty of handling thick shells within relativity , early authors assumed the idealization of a singular surface as a thin shell and tried to formulate its dynamics in general relativity @xcite .",
    "einstein and strauss used implicitly the concept of a thick shell to embed a spherical star in a frw universe @xcite .",
    "the new era of intense interest in thin shells and walls began with the development of ideas relating to the phase transitions in early universe and the formation of topological defects . again ,",
    "mainly because of technical difficulties , strings and domain walls were assumed to be infinitesimally thin @xcite .",
    "interest in thin shells , or hypersurfaces of discontinuity , thereafter received an impetus from cosmology of early universe .",
    "the formulation of dynamics of such singular surfaces @xcite was summed up in the modern terminology by israel @xcite . in the sen - lanczos - darmois - israel ( sldi )",
    "formalism , thin shells are regarded as idealized zero thickness objects , with a @xmath0-function singularity in their energy - momentum and einstein tensors .",
    "+ in contrast to thin walls , thickness causes new subtleties , depending on how the thickness is defined and handled .",
    "early attempts to formulate thickness , mainly motivated by the outcome of the idea of late phase transitions in cosmology @xcite , were concentrated on domain walls .",
    "silveira @xcite studied the dynamics of a spherical thick domain wall by appropriately defining an average radius @xmath1 , and then used the well - known plane wall scalar field solution as the first approximation to derive a formula relating @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 as the equation of motion for the thick wall .",
    "widrow @xcite used the einstein - scalar equations for a static thick domain wall with planar symmetry .",
    "he then took the zero - thickness limit of his solution and showed that the orthogonal components of the energy - momentum tensor would vanish in that limit .",
    "garfinkle and gregory @xcite presented a modification of the israel thin shell equations to treat the evolution of thick domain walls in vacuum .",
    "they used an expansion of the coupled einstein - scalar field equations describing the thick gravitating wall in powers of the thickness of the domain wall around the well - known solution of the hyperbolic tangent kink for a @xmath4 wall .",
    "they concluded that the effect of thickness in the first approximation was to effectively reduce the energy density of the wall compared to the thin case , leading to a faster collapse of a spherical wall in vacuum ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite applied the expansion to the wall action and integrated it perpendicular to the wall to show that the effective action for a thick domain wall in vacuum , apart from the usual nambu term , consists of a contribution proportional to the induced ricci curvature scalar .",
    "+ renewed interest in walls and branes , specially in higher dimensions , came from string theory , mainly because it provided a novel approach for resolving the cosmological constant and the hierarchy problems @xcite . in this scenario gravitation",
    "is localized on a brane reproducing effectively four dimensional gravity at large distances due to the warp geometry of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "there are a large number of papers in last years dealing with different properties of thick walls and branes .",
    "most of these papers use a solution of einstein - scalar field equation in n - dimensional spacetime representing a codimension-1 or 2 brane , or a smoothing or smearing mechanism to modify the randall - sundrum ansatz @xcite . however , as far as the geometry of the problem is concerned- irrespective of the spacetime dimension and the motivation for considering a wall or brane- these models are all based on a regular solution of einstein equations on a manifold with specified asymptotic behaviour representing a localized scalar field , as it was assumed in early works @xcite . +",
    "a completely different method based on the gluing of a thick wall , considered as a regular manifold , to two different manifolds on both sides of it , was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the idea behind this suggestion is to understand the dynamics of a localized matter distribution of any kind confined within two principally different spacetimes or matter phases . such a matching of three different manifolds appears to have many applications in astrophysics , early universe , and string cosmology .",
    "it enables one to have any topology and any spacetime on each side of the thick wall or brane .",
    "one may apply it to the dynamics of galaxy clusters and their halos or to a brane in any spacetime dimension with any symmetry on each side of it . by definition ,",
    "such a matching is regular and there is no singular surface in this formulation .",
    "therefore _ darmois junction conditions _ for the extrinsic curvature tensor on the thick shell boundaries with the two embedding spacetimes can be applied .",
    "they have applied their definition of a thick wall to the special case of a spherically symmetric dust thick shell with constant coordinate thickness . using an expansion scheme in the thickness of the shell they were then able to obtain an approximate equation of motion for the thick shell in vacuum .",
    "+ our aim is to generalize their formalism and give the basic dynamical equations governing a thick codimension-1 brane , relaxing some of their assumptions @xcite .",
    "specifically , we make no assumption of symmetry or the equation of state of the brane matter , and introduce the proper thickness of the wall , instead of using a comoving wall thickness .",
    "we then apply our formalism to a dust thick shell immersed in vacuum and also in a friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) spacetime , taking into account the peculiar velocity of the dust brane layers with respect to the background geometry , in contrast to the previous work where it was neglected @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we develop a thick wall formalism yielding a generic equation to study the evolution of thick shells in curved spacetime . in section 3",
    ", we apply our formalism to obtain the equations of motion of a spherical thick shell of dust matter in vacuum .",
    "section 4 deals with a thick wall in a frw spacetime .",
    "we conclude then in section 5 .",
    "+ natural geometrized units , in which @xmath5 are used throughout the paper .",
    "the two boundary limits of the thick wall are called @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the core of the thick wall is denoted by @xmath8 . for any quantity @xmath9 let @xmath10 denote @xmath11 .",
    "square bracket @xmath12 $ ] indicates the jump of any quantity @xmath13 across @xmath14 .",
    "latin indices range over the intrinsic coordinates of @xmath14 denoted by @xmath15 , and greek indices over the coordinates of the 4-manifolds .",
    "the technology of manipulating thin and thick walls in general relativity in arbitrary dimension are basically different .",
    "thin walls can be treated in two different but equivalent ways .",
    "either one solves einstein equations in @xmath16 dimension with a _",
    "distributional _ energy momentum tensor which mimics an infinitesimally thin wall carrying some kind of matter ( dark or not dark , including radiation ) , or one takes known solutions of the einstein equations on every side of the wall and glues them to the wall by applying boundary conditions at the wall location .",
    "the equivalence of these two procedures is not trivial but has been shown rigorously for the general case @xcite .",
    "boundary surfaces without any energy - momentum tensor can just be considered as a special case .",
    "it should be noted that such an equivalence does not exist for the codimension-2 walls or defects like strings in 4 spacetime dimension .",
    "the lack of such an equivalence in the case of thick walls forces us to differentiate between various definitions of thick walls or branes .",
    "+ usually for a thick wall , one takes a solution of the einstein equations representing a localized scalar field having a well - defined asymptotic behaviour @xcite .",
    "although this maybe a reasonable assumption , its application is however limited .",
    "we prefer to accept another definition , first formalized in @xcite , being more suitable for different applications in astrophysics and string cosmology .",
    "however , it must be mentioned that a similar approach has been used in @xcite for the special case of a spherically symmetric thick shell along with an application to a more restricted junction condition in a two - fluid model of oscillations of a neutron star @xcite . + now assume a localized matter distribution to be considered as a solution of einstein equations on a specific manifold with well - defined boundaries .",
    "this thick wall is then immersed in a universe which is defined in principle differently on different sides of the wall , being infinite in the planar or cylindrical case or compact in the spherical case .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the thin wall formalism where one glues two different manifolds along a singular hypersurface , our definition of a thick wall leads to the problem of gluing three different manifolds along non - singular hypersurfaces .",
    "+ consider a thick wall with two boundaries @xmath17 and @xmath18 dividing the space - time manifold @xmath19 into three regions : @xmath20 and @xmath21 , both outside the wall , and @xmath22 within the thick wall itself such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "treating the two surface boundaries @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which separate the manifold @xmath27 from two distinct manifolds @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , as nonsingular timelike hypersurfaces , is equivalent to the continuity of the intrinsic metric @xmath28 and the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath29 of @xmath30 across the corresponding hypersurfaces .",
    "in other words , there is no distribution of energy - momentum concentrated on the thick wall boundaries @xmath6 .",
    "these crucial requirements have been first formulated in @xcite :    @xmath31\\stackrel{\\sigma_{j}}{=}0,\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad \\quad \\quad j=1,2,\\ ] ]    @xmath32   \\stackrel{\\sigma_{j}}{= } 0 , \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad \\quad\\quad j=1,2.\\ ] ]    note that in principle the boundaries @xmath33 could also be space - like .",
    "our restriction to time - like ones is just to simplify the formalism as much as possible and if required , our formalism maybe trivially applied to space - like cases .",
    "now if we write ( [ kmn ] ) on @xmath17 and @xmath18 separately , and add these two equations , we obtain @xmath34 where the superscripts @xmath35 and @xmath36 mean that the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath29 of @xmath37 ) is evaluated in the regions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . for convenience , we introduce a gaussian normal coordinate system @xmath40 in the neighborhood of the core of the thick shell denoted by @xmath41 , corresponding to @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 are the intrinsic coordinates of @xmath41 , and @xmath44 is the proper length along the geodesics orthogonal to @xmath41 .",
    "let us now expand the extrinsic curvature tensors in a taylor series around @xmath41 situated at @xmath42 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the proper thickness of the wall , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the above expansion is justified if the proper thickness of the wall is small relative to the radius of curvature ( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "should this assumption not be valid , we either have to go to the higher order terms , or to use directly the exact equation ( [ kmn2 ] ) .",
    "the derivative of the extrinsic curvature is now given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the normal vector field , and @xmath51 are the three basis vectors tangent to @xmath41 .",
    "substituting ( [ expansion ] ) into ( [ kmn2 ] ) and taking into account ( [ lie ] ) , we arrive at : @xmath52 this is the basic equation for the dynamics of a thick wall in a curved spacetime , written up to the first order in @xmath36 . while the metrics in @xmath53 and @xmath54 are usually given in advance , knowing the metric in the wall spacetime @xmath39 , however , requires a nontrivial work .",
    "equation ( [ fund ] ) , or the corresponding exact one ( [ kmn2 ] ) , is to be considered as the generalization of the israel s thin wall condition @xcite to the thick case .",
    "we will apply it now to particular examples of a spherically symmetric dust thick shell in vacuum as well as to a frw universe in which @xmath36 is independent of angular coordinates .",
    "however , ( [ fund ] ) is valid for more general cases without spherical symmetry where @xmath36 is not a constant .",
    "furthermore , @xmath36 in general may be a function of time but for the sake of simplicity here we take it to be constant in time .",
    "as the first example we consider a thick dust shell in vacuum .",
    "we first derive the basic exact equations underlying the dynamics and expand it in powers of the thickness , and then calculate the peculiar velocity and its impact on the collapse of the shell following by a comparison to the thin shell limit already known .",
    "we constrain our calculations to the special case of motion of a shell represented by an ltb solution where no shell crossing occurs @xcite .",
    "consider a spherically symmetric dust thick shell immersed in vacuum .",
    "the spacetime exterior to the shell is schwarzschild , and the interior is taken to be the minkowski flat spacetime : @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 being the mass of the thick shell . to allow for",
    "the inhomogeneity of the mass distribution within the shell , we take its metric to be that of the lemaitre - tolman - bondi(ltb ) . in the synchronous comoving coordinates @xmath58 , the ltb metric takes the following form @xcite : @xmath59 where the prime denotes the partial differentiation with respect to @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is an arbitrary real function such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( because of the no shell crossing condition ) .",
    "the corresponding einstein field equations then turn out to be @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the energy density of the dust fluid in @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is another arbitrary real smooth function interpreted as the mass .",
    "+ let us now proceed to apply ( [ fund ] ) in order to investigate the evolution of the spherical thick shell described above .",
    "the angular component of ( [ fund ] ) for the thick shell in vacuum is given by @xmath68    the corresponding time component of ( [ fund ] ) is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the four velocity tangent to @xmath41 . armed with ( [ kthth ] ) and ( [ eqktt ] ) , we are now in a position to write down explicitly the equation of motion of the thick shell .",
    "note that the four velocity @xmath70 and the normal vector @xmath50 on the spherical thick shell s core @xmath41 for the schwarzschild and ltb spacetimes are , respectively @xmath71 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath72 on @xmath41 , and @xmath73 is the peculiar velocity of @xmath41 relative to the ltb geometry defined as @xmath74 and is related to the lorentz factor in the ltb geometry as @xmath75 note that the definition of the peculiar velocity , ( [ pecvel ] ) , ceases to be valid for a thin shell , in which @xmath76 .",
    "relevant components of the riemannian curvature tensor for the schwarzschild spacetime are @xmath77 and for the ltb spacetime are @xmath78 the components of the extrinsic curvature tensor on @xmath41 evaluated with respect to the relevant regions are given by @xmath79 and @xmath80 substituting ( [ unout]-[ktt ] ) into ( [ kthth ] ) and ( [ eqktt ] ) , after some manipulations we end up with two independent equations written up to the first order of @xmath81 as follows : @xmath82 and @xmath83 where for convenience we have defined @xmath84 the peculiar velocity @xmath85 can also be written in an explicit form .",
    "the angular component of the extrinsic curvature of @xmath41 in the gaussian normal coordinate is @xmath86 where we have used ( [ unwall ] ) . on the other hand",
    "one can write @xmath87 eliminating @xmath88 from ( [ kthth2 ] ) and ( [ dotr ] ) and using the expression ( [ kthth1 ] ) for @xmath89 evaluated with respect to ltb geometry we deduce the following formula @xmath90 which is valid only for the shells of finite thickness",
    ". equations ( [ thickeq1 ] ) and ( [ thickeq2 ] ) together with ( [ upsilon ] ) are the dust thick shell equations of motion written up to the first order in terms of the shell s proper thickness . given the initial data @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath36 , one can in principle solve this set of differential equations to determine the time evolutions of the proper radius @xmath95 and and the mass density @xmath96 of the thick shell s core .",
    "+      in order to investigate the impact of the proper thickness as well as the peculiar velocity on the dynamics of the shell we take a closer look at ( [ thickeq1 ] ) . for the sake of comparison to the thin wall case , we write down the following relation between the surface energy density of the dust thin shell and the energy density of the dust thick shell evaluated on @xmath41 up to the first order in @xmath36 : @xmath97 now , assuming @xmath98 , the ( [ thickeq1 ] ) can be written as : @xmath99 where we have singled out an effective surface density @xmath100 defined by @xmath101 equation ( [ equation ] ) has the well - known form of the dynamics of a spherical thin shell with the effective surface energy density @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "+ the zero thickness limit of the shell is therefore defined by @xmath102 and @xmath103 , as mentioned in the paragraph following ( [ tdot ] ) . note that in this limit the density @xmath104 blows up while the integral ( [ rho ] ) remains fixed , so that all the information of internal structure of the shell is squeezed in the surface energy density @xmath105 .",
    "taking this limit , ( [ equation ] ) reduces to the familiar equation of motion for the dust thin shell in vacuum @xcite .",
    "the case of vanishing peculiar velocity , i.e. if the shell s core is comoving with the ltb expansion @xmath106 , is specially easy to discuss .",
    "assuming @xmath107 , which is usually the case , we have @xmath108 . solving ( [ equation ] ) for @xmath109 , we get @xmath110 we now focus our attention on the dependence of @xmath111 on @xmath100 for a given shell s radius @xmath112 and a given initial value for @xmath57 to see how the thickness affects the collapse velocity . taking into account @xmath113 , which means roughly that the radius of the shell s core is greater than its schwarzschild radius , we obtain for the zeros of @xmath111 ( figure 1 ) :    ( 150,135)(-100,30 )    @xmath114    the branch @xmath115 , leading to @xmath116 , is not physical .",
    "the branch @xmath117 corresponds to the equation @xmath118 , arising from the process of squaring ( [ equation ] ) , turns out to be irrelevant to our problem , as we are just considering the ordinary centered shells ( black hole type matching ) @xcite .",
    "we are left , therefore , with the branch corresponding to @xmath119 in which @xmath111 is a decreasing function of @xmath100 .",
    "hence , for a comoving @xmath41 @xmath106 , having @xmath108 , the thickness in the first order leads to a faster collapse of the thick shell relative to a thin shell in vacuum .",
    "this corresponds to the case discussed in @xcite . while for a @xmath41 with a small peculiar velocity with respect to the ltb background",
    ", the effective energy density @xmath100 tends to increase leading to a slowdown of the collapse velocity of the shell relative to a comoving one .",
    "dust thick shells embedded in frw space times may have different applications .",
    "the dynamics of great wall in astrophysics , supernovae envelopes , and voids are just few examples .",
    "it is different from the vacuum case as the space time is not any more asymptotically minkowski .",
    "the dynamics of frw in and outside of the shell makes it necessary to take care of the peculiar velocity relative to both frw space times which make the calculation lengthier .",
    "consider a spherically symmetric thick shell of dust matter separated by two different dust - filled frw spacetimes whose metrics are given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 the spacetime of the thick dust shell itself is again described by a ltb metric ( [ ltb ] ) .",
    "we have to write down first the relevant components of the ( [ fund ] ) .",
    "the four - velocity @xmath70 and the normal vector @xmath50 on the spherical thick shell s core @xmath41 measured by the frw observers on both sides of the shell are , respectively , given by @xmath122 dots denote again the derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath72 on @xmath41 .",
    "the relevant components of the riemann curvature tensor for the frw spacetime are @xmath123 following components of the extrinsic curvature tensor for the interior and exterior frw metrics evaluated on @xmath41 are also required : @xmath124 the standard junction , we are using , corresponds to @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , we have @xcite : @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 represent the peculiar velocities of @xmath41 relative to the expansion in the interior and exterior frw spacetimes , respectively .",
    "these can be computed in the same way as was done for @xmath73 in ( [ upsilon ] ) : @xmath129 where we have defined @xmath130 combining all these results , we get the following final form for the angular and time component of ( [ fund ] ) written up to the first order in @xmath36 , @xmath131 once we know the frw solutions in @xmath132 ( i.e. , @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) , we can solve in principle the set of equations ( [ eqfrw]-[thickeq2frw ] ) , ( [ upsilonfrw ] ) , and ( [ upsilon ] ) for the given initial conditions @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath135 , and constant @xmath36 , to determine the time evolutions of the proper radius @xmath95 and mass density @xmath96 of the thick shell s core . note that the solutions in @xmath132 are expressed in terms of the cosmic times @xmath136 , hence one needs to take into account the following equation : @xmath137      let us now look at the effects of the thickness on the evolution of the shell in frw spacetimes . using ( [ rho ] ) and assuming @xmath138 we rewrite ( [ eqfrw ] ) in the following familiar form : @xmath139 where we have again introduced an effective surface energy as @xmath140 equation ( [ israelfrw ] ) is identical to the equation of motion of a thin shell with the effective surface energy density @xmath100 playing the role of @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , taking the zero thickness limit @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we see that ( [ israelfrw ] ) reduces to the equation of motion for a thin shell gluing two different frw spacetimes obtained by maeda @xcite and berezin _ et al _ , @xcite .",
    "depending on the relative magnitudes of the different terms on the right hand side of ( [ sigmafrw ] ) , coming from the shell itself and the surrounding media @xmath132 , we may have @xmath108 , or vice versa . proceeding exactly in the same manner as before ,",
    "we solve ( [ israelfrw ] ) for @xmath111 and obtain @xmath141 the zeroes of @xmath111 are @xmath142 it is easily seen that in the case of @xmath117 the solution ( [ rdotfrw ] ) in which @xmath111 increases with @xmath100 , belongs to ( [ israelfrw ] ) with @xmath143 ( figure 1 ) . according to ( [ epsilonfrw ] )",
    "this case may happen in a closed universe @xmath144 with @xmath145 , and in a flat or open universe whenever the peculiar velocity @xmath128 of @xmath41 is negative and the radius @xmath112 is greater than the hubble radius @xmath146 .",
    "then , depending on @xmath147 or @xmath148 , a comparison to the thin shell case shows that the effect of the first order corrections due to the shell s thickness is to slowdown or speed up the shell s core motion .",
    "the case @xmath149 is not physical because of the relation @xmath116 . finally , the case @xmath119 in which @xmath111 is a decreasing function of @xmath100 , corresponds to ( [ israelfrw ] ) with @xmath150 implying a slowdown of the shell for larger values of @xmath100 .",
    "thus , if the outer bracket in the ( [ sigmafrw ] ) is smaller ( greater ) than one , then we may say that the effect of the first order corrections to the thin shell approximations is to speed up ( down ) the shell s core motion .",
    "the dynamics of a thick wall embedded in curved spacetimes has been studied in a more general setting than our previous work @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by imposing the darmois junction conditions on boundaries of a codimension-1 wall with two embedding spacetimes of any dimension . using an expansion scheme for the extrinsic curvature tensor of the wall boundaries in terms of its proper thickness",
    ", we have then obtained the general equation ( [ fund ] ) describing the evolution of the wall s core embedded in the n - dimensional spacetime .",
    "our treatment is valid for those walls or branes whose thickness are small compared to their curvature radius .",
    "we have exemplified our formalism in two different cases of walls immersed in vacuum and walls immersed in frw spacetimes .",
    "taking the spacetime within the wall itself to be inhomogeneous of the ltb - type , in both cases the peculiar velocity of the wall s core relative to the ltb metric of the wall turns out to play an important role .",
    "+ we have written down the equations of motion for the wall , up to the first order of the proper thickness , and it was shown in both cases that in the limit of the thin wall we obtain the known results of the corresponding thin walls .",
    "in fact the equations of motion could be written in a form similar to the thin wall cases with an effective surface density . in the case of a wall immersed in vacuum ,",
    "it turns out that the effect of the proper thickness @xmath36 is to speed up the collapse of the comoving spherical dust shell , while the first order peculiar velocity correction tends to decrease the collapse velocity . in the case of a dust",
    "thick shell immersed in frw spacetimes , the first order effect of the thickness is much more complicated , depending on different parameters coming from the frw spacetimes on both sides of the shell and the ltb spacetime of the shell itself .",
    "+ the formalism presented is quite general .",
    "it can be applied to any other type of the wall or brane , such as gravitating domain walls in curved spacetime having a planar or spherical symmetry or thick branes in brane cosmology , given that the geometry of the wall itself is known .",
