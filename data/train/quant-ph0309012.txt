    "in papers@xcite we presented the conjecture :    * there exists a fundamental quant of time @xmath0 . *    in fact",
    "we came to this conjecture by finding ( by pure occasion ) that statistical histograms obtained for classical systems in the one or two slit experiments can have the form of quantum - like interference observed in experiments with photons or electrons .",
    "we started to speculate that essential features of quantum statistics ( at least some of them ) could be obtained as a consequence of existence of time quant .",
    "basically speaking the idea of discretization is quite natural for physics .",
    "indeed discretization of energy was exploited by plank - einstein ideas in order to explain such quantum phenomena as black body radiation , photo - electric effect , etc . on the other hand from the point of view of energy - time uncertainty relations discretization of time",
    "gives certain constraints to a ( measured ) energy of the system .    on the other hand by introducing discretized time one effectively changes the theoretical structure of the space - time on small distances .",
    "from this point of view it is rather natural to assume that a value of the discreteness parameter is of the order of plank time @xmath1 .",
    "one could think of discretized time as a lack of information of where the particle is during the discretization period .    in this paper we study deterministic model for particle scattering on a screen with a single slit .",
    "resulting interference picture has a nontrivial minimum - maximum distribution which is qualitatively the same as one obtained in quantum experiments .",
    "the interference pattern appears as a statistical effect of particles which have trajectories .",
    "the interference picture has no relation to ` self - interference ' of particles , no wave - structure is involved into considerations .",
    "the basic source of interference is the discrete time scale used in our mathematical model : instead of newton s differential equations with continuous time evolution , we consider difference equations with discrete time evolution . interference effect disappears as the time discreteness parameter goes to zero .",
    "the picture includes some interesting nonclassical properties such as a ` black ' region behind the center of the slit for details ) . ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we provide basic ideas of the discrete time formalism and compare it with construction of quantum mechanics . in section [ sec : ddyn ]",
    "we write dynamical equations with discrete time and in section [ sec : newton ] we present them in intuitive form . in section",
    "[ sec : sslit ] we apply the formalism to a particle scattering on a screen with a slit and study appearance and properties of the resulting interference picture .",
    "finally , in the appendix we provide a detailed description of the numerical simulation performed , we list a _ mathematica _ program which mirrors the original parallel _ c++ _ programm which we used to perform actual simulation .",
    "we remind that recently it was suggested@xcite that quantum mechanical interference rules could be explained using contextual transformations .",
    "this approach makes one think of a construction of physically reasonable model which produces interference resting on the classical rule of addition of probabilistic alternatives ( extended with a notion of _ context _ ) .",
    "our quantum - time approach could be considered as a candidate for such a model .",
    "according to the principles of quantum mechanics in order to compute measurable quantities , in the simplest case , one has to perform the following steps@xcite .",
    "first , the form of classical and quantum equations of motion remains the same ( we are talking about heisinberg s representation ) , although the dynamical variables are now noncommutative .",
    "next , one has to add to the original initial conditions an extra one stating commutative properties of the canonical variables , like @xmath2=i\\hbar$ ] . at the last step one",
    "says that measurable quantities are eigenvalues of the dynamical variables . here",
    "the second step introduces the plank constant which distinguishes classical and quantum worlds .",
    "the noncommutative property of dynamical variables is the root of the fact that quantum particles can not have trajectories and introduction of quantum state implies the nondeterministic behavior of quantum systems .    in this note",
    "we tried to achieve the same results for measurable quantities as in quantum mechanics ( at least in the part vastly supported by experiments ) , but trying to keep trajectories and deterministic behavior of particles .",
    "we follow steps similar to the above ones , but we keep the measurable quantities being real functions .",
    "nevertheless , we have had to introduce the time discreteness parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we start from classical equations of motion with discrete time and postulate the canonical variables to be measurable .",
    "in both classical and quantum mechanics a dynamical function @xmath3 evolves according to the following well known equation @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a hamiltonian of the system and in the right hand side is a poisson bracket , either classical or quantum=\\frac{{\\partial}a}{{\\partial}p}\\frac{{\\partial}b}{{\\partial}q } - \\frac{{\\partial}a}{{\\partial}q}\\frac{{\\partial}b}{{\\partial}p}\\ ] ] and in quantum mechanics it is a commutator @xmath6=\\frac{1}{i\\hbar}(ab - ba)$ ] ] .    in both classical and quantum dynamics",
    "the left hand side of ( [ dyneq ] ) is the same , it contains a continuous time derivative @xmath7    as it was mentioned in the previous section we are interested in construction dynamics with discrete time .",
    "this is done with the help of _ discrete derivative _ which is postulated to be @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the discreteness parameter .",
    "this parameter is finite and is treated in the same way as plank constant in quantum mechanical formalism . in particular if @xmath0 is small relative to dimentions of the system then classical approximation with continuous derivative should work well ( although this could not be the case all the time in the same sense as there are examples when quantum formalism is reasonable even for macroscopic systems , for example in superfluidity ) .",
    "thus the discrete time dynamical equation is postulated to be @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a real - valued function of real - valued dynamical variables and in the right hand side there is the classical poisson bracket ( see ( [ cposs ] ) ) .",
    "please note that in our model the coordinate space is left continuous .",
    "in this section we provide an intuitive description of the discretization procedure described above . consider a well known newton s equation @xmath11 this equation gives the same dynamics as ( [ dyneq])-([cposs ] ) .",
    "let us now modify this equation , introducing the time discreteness parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we rewrite the second order differential equation ( [ eq ] ) as a system of first order differential equations , we have @xmath12 in the system ( [ e1 ] ) the derivatives assume continuousness of time .",
    "let us now introduce the discreteness parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we have @xmath13 in the limit of @xmath14 ( [ e2 ] ) is equivalent to ( [ eq ] ) and ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "now let us rewrite the system ( [ e2 ] ) in a directly computable way @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "consider the following experimental setup ( see fig.[fig : setup ] ) .",
    "a particle source @xmath17 is located in front of the center of a slit in a screen @xmath18 . near the slit",
    "there is a nonzero force field which affects particles , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 are coordinates along horizontal and vertical axes respectively , the axes origin is in the center of the slit ) .",
    "particles pass through the slit and concentrate on a second screen @xmath22 .",
    "we study a particle density on the screen @xmath22 .",
    "let us start from the simplest case when the force field is constant and perpendicular to the screens , @xmath23 , for @xmath24 and @xmath25 otherwise .",
    "let the source @xmath17 be point - like emitting particles with constant velocity @xmath26 under random evenly distributed angles @xmath27 . in this case trajectories of particles emitted by @xmath17 ( in discrete time dynamics ) in the region @xmath28",
    "( i.e. before the screen @xmath18 ) form concentric circles originating from @xmath17 with the radii @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( fig.[fig : circs ] ) .",
    "we get the circles  which are trajectories of many particles emitted under close angles  in the region where there is no force field and particles move along strait lines , exactly as in classical dynamics .",
    "let @xmath31 be the points where these circles enter the region @xmath32 .",
    "the distance between the center of the slit and @xmath31 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a distance between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath35 is the largest integral value not greater than a fraction @xmath36 , @xmath37 this rather simple setup already produces interesting nontrivial interference pattern ( fig.[fig : histg ] ) .",
    "the points @xmath31 are the origins of deviation from ` classical ' ( i.e. continuous time ) trajectories .",
    "this deviation forms the interference pattern . to argument this let @xmath38 be an angle between the horizontal axis and a line connecting @xmath17 and @xmath31 .",
    "particles emitted under angles less than @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) become affected by the force field in the region @xmath32 one step earlier than those emitted under angles grater than @xmath38 . as a result",
    "there appears a ` fork '  even very close trajectories but with the angles above and below @xmath38 become separated .",
    "one could get the points of minima of the interference pattern by following the trajectory along the line @xmath40 and the parabolic curve ( movement in a constant field ) in the region @xmath41 until the trajectory hits the screen @xmath22 .",
    "the case described above is not completely physically reasonable , indeed is requires a force field everywhere in the half - plane @xmath24 , thus it could be considered only as a simplified model which still demonstrates some interesting properties of discrete time dynamics .",
    "an example of such a property is a fresnel - like phenomenon of a black region behind the center of the slit which is discussed below .",
    "one could see from ( [ ai])-([n0 ] ) that if @xmath42 then @xmath43 , and thus the particle trajectories emitted under positive and negative become separated .",
    "this forms a black region in the center of the screen @xmath22 just behind the slit ( fig.[fig : black ] ) .",
    "although we succeeded with a model of a field localized near the slit .",
    "we took gaussian rapidly changing force field of the form @xmath44 it is very stimulating that such setup also produces nontrivial pattern , since it means that one could start thinking of a physical nature of this force field .",
    "we have also considered the case of non - point - like gaussian source distributed along the vertical line .",
    "this produces smoother picture , which could be obtained by convolving the pattern on fig.[fig : histg ] with a gaussian kernel .",
