    "the study of collective motions in hot and fast rotating nuclei , especially giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) , provides a unique probe to explore the various kinds of structure ( triaxial , prolate , oblate , spherical ) that the nuclear system can assume at high temperature ( @xmath3 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "this vibrational mode of nucleus is described as the out of phase oscillation between the protons and the neutrons . over the years",
    ", intensive experimental studies of the gdr built on highly excited states of nuclei have shown that the gdr width increases with both t and j @xcite .",
    "this increase of the gdr width is described reasonably well within the theoretical thermal shape fluctuation model ( tsfm ) .",
    "the tsfm is based on large amplitude thermal fluctuation of nuclear shape under the assumption that the time scale associated with thermal fluctuation is slow compared to gdr vibrations and the observed gdr strength function is the weighted average of all the shapes and orientations @xcite . a systematic study of the thermal fluctuation model revealed the existence of a universal scaling law ( ptsfm ) for the apparent width of the gdr for all t , j and a @xcite .",
    "although ptsfm shows an increase of the gdr width with t , the model differs significantly from the experimental data at low temperatures ( @xmath5 1.5 mev ) @xcite . in a recent work ,",
    "a critical temperature included fluctuation model ( ctfm ) @xcite was put forward incorporating an essential modification on the ptsfm , which was found to predict successfully the evolution of the gdr width of many different nuclei with temperature and angular momentum ( at least up to t @xmath6 3.0 mev and j @xmath6 60 @xmath7 ) .",
    "the ctfm emphasizes on a crucial point , overlooked in the ptsfm @xcite , that the gdr vibration itself induces a quadrupole moment even at @xmath3 = 0 mev causing the nuclear shape to fluctuate .",
    "when the giant dipole vibration having its own intrinsic fluctuation is used as a probe to view the thermal shape fluctuations , it is unlikely to feel the thermal fluctuations that are smaller than its own intrinsic fluctuation . as a result",
    ", the experimental gdr width should remain nearly constant at the ground state values up to a critical temperature ( @xmath8 ) and the effect of thermal fluctuations should become evident only when they become larger than the intrinsic gdr fluctuations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath2 in ctfm is always adopted from the existing ground state gdr width systematics of nuclei , whereas , the ptsfm takes the ground state gdr width @xmath2 generally as a free adjustable parameter ( @xmath6 3.8 mev for all nuclei ) without any proper justification @xcite .",
    "a recent experimental investigation @xcite populating the compound nucleus ( @xmath9 ) @xmath0sm , in the reactions @xmath10si + @xmath11cd at e(@xmath10si ) @xmath6 125 and 140 mev , demonstrates the evolution of the gdr width with @xmath4 at low temperature ( @xmath12 1.5 mev ) . according to this recent experiment",
    ", the phenomenological parameterization ptsfm @xcite predicts the angular momentum dependent gdr width successfully . in this regard , it is worthwhile to mention that previously a few experimental investigations @xcite on j - dependence of the gdr width have indicated the underestimated predictions of the ptsfm in comparison to the experimental data , especially in the higher angular momentum region . to this end , the whole scenario appears to be confusing .",
    "thus , it appears to be interesting and tempting as well to exploit the above mentioned experimental data on @xmath0sm as a testing ground of the universality of our recently proposed ctfm .",
    "the evolution of the gdr width as a function of angular momentum has also been studied recently for @xmath1gd at two different excitation energies in the reactions @xmath10si",
    "+ @xmath13sn at e(@xmath10si ) @xmath6 149 and 185 mev @xcite .",
    "the authors found that two different values of @xmath2 ( 3.8 and 4.8 mev ) were required in the ptsfm to explain the experimental systematics at the two incident energies ( 149 and 185 mev , respectively ) .",
    "they concluded that the contributions from both the inhomogeneous damping and the intrinsic collisional damping processes should be included .",
    "they proposed an empirical relation for the increase of the gdr width as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , they used the ground state value @xmath2 @xmath6 3.8 mev which is much smaller than the actual ground state value of @xmath1gd @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is relevant to test the ctfm for @xmath1gd for the two excitation energies .",
    "the present work aims at examing the universality of ctfm by exploiting the data sets on @xmath0sm and @xmath1gd and at the same time comparing the predictions of ctfm with those due to ptsfm .",
    "in heavy ion fusion reactions , the @xmath14-rays from the gdr - decay are emitted from various stages of decay cascade of the cn and thus , average values should be considered .",
    "the average values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the cn for gdr gamma decay should be different and less than those of the initial compound nucleus .",
    "on the other hand , it is also not proper to include each step in the cn decay chain for the averaging . instead ,",
    "for the purpose , one should incorporate only that part of the decay cascade which is contributing to the gdr @xmath14-emission , thereby , setting a lower limit for the excitation energy in the cn decay cascade .",
    "this lower limit is estimated from the divided plot of the high energy @xmath14-spectrum when the cutoff in the excitation energy only affects the @xmath14-emission at very low energies but does not alter the gdr width .",
    "the procedure is discussed in detail in ref @xcite .",
    "although an average temperature was estimated in ref @xcite for @xmath0sm , it was calculated considering all the decay steps thereby lowering @xmath15 . moreover ,",
    "no averaging was performed for the spin distribution and mean j was taken to be that of the initial compound nucleus which further reduced the average value of t. therefore , @xmath16 and @xmath15 have been re - estimated applying the procedure discussed in ref @xcite using a modified version of the statistical model code cascade @xcite .",
    "the average t was estimated as @xmath15=[(@xmath17 - @xmath18 - e@xmath19)/@xmath20@xmath21 , where @xmath22 ) is the energy dependent level density parameter and @xmath23 is the pairing energy .",
    "@xmath18 was evaluated with @xmath16 re - estimated using the above mentioned lower limit in e@xmath24 , while @xmath17 was calculated by averaging e@xmath24 with corresponding weights over the daughter nuclei in the cn decay cascade for the @xmath14-emission in the gdr energy range 10 - 20 mev .",
    "the initial j@xmath25 for each fold has been selected from the given j distribution in ref @xcite .",
    "the energy loss through half the thickness of the target was also included as suggested by the authors by populating the cn at 68 and 80 mev corresponding to the incident energies of 125 and 140 mev , respectively .",

    "as it appears , ptsfm represents the correct trend of j - dependence of the gdr width but is unable to explain the @xmath1gd data because it does not represent the correct description of the evolution of the gdr width with t. however , it needs to be mentioned that the ptsfm was formulated at a time when there was no experimental data for gdr widths at low temperatures .",

    "thus , the good match of the ctfm with the experimental data for both @xmath0sm and @xmath1gd clearly points toward the fact that the phenomenological ctfm can be used efficiently to describe the evolution of the gdr width with both t and j in the entire mass region .",
    "in conclusion , the ctfm gives good description of the j - dependence of gdr width systematics , for both @xmath0sm and @xmath1gd studied at two different excitation energies , using the actual ground state gdr width values for both the nuclei . on the other hand , the ptsfm based on the thermal shape fluctuation model explains the data for @xmath0sm but can not represent the @xmath1gd data for the two excitation energies using a single value of @xmath2 .",
    "the good description of the ctfm for both @xmath0sm and @xmath1gd as well as the validity of the universal correlation between the average deformation of the nucleus and the tsfm should provide new insights into the modification of the tsfm by including the gdr induced quadrupole moment to explain the gdr width systematics at low t.      m. n. harakeh and a. van der woude , giant resonances , fundamental high - frequency modes of nuclear excitation , clarendon press , oxford , 2001 .",
