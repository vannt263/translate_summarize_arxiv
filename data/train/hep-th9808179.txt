    "the conformal field theory for the simpler laughlin plateaus has been clearly identified as that of the abelian chiral boson @xcite , which is also called the chiral luttinger liquid .",
    "this theory describes the edge waves as well as the universal properties of the quasi - particle excitations : in particular , the latter possess fractional electric charge @xmath3 and fractional statistics @xmath4 , in agreement with the laughlin theory @xcite . some of these properties have been recently measured @xcite and have been found to agree with the conformal theory .    on the other hand ,",
    "the edge excitations of the hierarchical plateaus ( [ filfrac ] ) are less understood at present .",
    "two classes of cfts have been proposed : the first is the multi - component bosonic theory , which is characterized by the abelian current algebra @xmath5 ( more precisely , @xmath6 ) @xcite ; these theories generalize the well - established one - component theory describing the laughlin plateaus @xcite .",
    "the other proposed theories are given by the minimal models of the @xmath0 algebra @xcite .",
    "according to the laughlin physical picture @xcite , the electrons form a quantum incompressible fluid at the hall plateaus .",
    "this fluid can be characterized by the @xmath7 symmetry of area - preserving diffeomorphisms of the plane @xcite@xcite ; moreover , the corresponding low - energy edge excitations are described by the conformal theories with @xmath0 symmetry @xcite , which include the specific class of the @xmath0 minimal models @xcite .",
    "the two proposed theories are identical for the laughlin hall states ; however , they describe the hierarchical plateaus according to different generalizations of the laughlin theory .",
    "they possess the same spectrum of quasi - particles , but differ in their specific properties .",
    "so far , the experiments have measured the quasi - particle charges and the two - point correlation functions , which are not enough for distinguishing between the two classes of theories .",
    "let us recall here the main features of the @xmath0 minimal models :    * they exist for the hierarchical plateaus ( [ filfrac ] ) only .",
    "* they exhibit a smaller number of edge excitations than the corresponding multi - component abelian theories . *",
    "they possess a single abelian charge for the quasi - particles , rather than the @xmath8 charges of the multi - component theories ; this unique charge is clearly identified with @xmath3 .",
    "* they have neutral quasi - particles which are labelled by the weights of the @xmath9 lie algebra , rather than by the @xmath10 abelian charges in the multi - component theories . as a consequence ,",
    "the quasi - particles of the minimal theories have non - abelian statistics .",
    "the @xmath0 minimal models have been introduced in the previous work @xcite : they were obtained by the typical algebraic construction of cft , which builds their hilbert space from a consistent collection of representations of the symmetry algebra .",
    "actually , the minimal models are made by the degenerate @xmath0 @xcite , which possess virasoro central charge @xmath11 , and are equivalent to the of the @xmath12 algebra @xcite .",
    "this construction showed that the minimal theories are obtained from the multi - component abelian ones by performing a reduction of degrees of freedom , which keeps the incompressibility of the electron fluid ; specifically , the reduction of the @xmath13 symmetry down to the @xmath14 one .    afterwards , the exact energy spectrum was numerically computed for the hall states of a system of ten electrons @xcite ; this study clearly indicated that the previous reduction of degrees of freedom is realized in the spectrum , and that the @xmath0 minimal models may have a chance to be the correct conformal theories of the hierarchical hall plateaus .",
    "therefore , it is important to describe this reduction in great detail and to understand its dynamical origin .    in this paper",
    ", we explicitly formulate the @xmath0 minimal models by quantizing a hamiltonian of the multi - component bosonic fields . in section @xmath15 , this hamiltonian is shown to be relevant in the renormalization - group sense : the corresponding flow interpolates between the multi - component abelian and the minimal theories , and performs the reduction of degrees of freedom for the latter theory in the infrared fixed point .",
    "this infrared limit can also be obtained by imposing a set of constraints on the states of the abelian fock space ; this procedure defines the @xmath14 algebra by the so - called hamiltonian reduction of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this rather simple description of the @xmath0 minimal models is completely equivalent to the previous algebraic construction @xcite : moreover , the hamiltonian formulation may be useful for understanding the microscopic dynamics of the reduction and for comparing with other approaches and the experimental results .",
    "in section @xmath16 , we present a simple physical picture for the electron ground state of the @xmath0 minimal models : this is a `` minimal '' incompressible hall fluid , which can be described as a chiral fermi sea , as done earlier for the laughlin fluids @xcite@xcite ; in this picture , the minimal - model constraints can be interpreted as further conditions for incompressibility . in this section",

    "let us finally stress that this hamiltonian formulation makes it clear that the @xmath0 minimal models are fully consistent theories , although they are not rational cfts @xcite ; namely , their partition function is not modular invariant @xcite ( see the discussion in section @xmath15 ) .",

    "the @xmath71 `` symmetry '' present in the @xmath22 degenerate representations of @xmath0 is a consequence of some properties discussed in ref.@xcite : in general , the @xmath89 degenerate @xmath0 representations are equivalent to the representations of the @xmath90 algebra , where @xmath14 is the zamolodchikov - fateev - lukyanov algebra at @xmath91 @xcite .",

    ", the minimal model contains each @xmath80 virasoro with multiplicity one , while the @xmath17 theories contain @xmath70 copies of it ( see eq.([deco ] ) ) .",

    "their quasi - particles are non - abelian , but their electrons are still abelian : actually , for these states there is a clear relation between the ( bulk ) wave - functions and the cft correlators on the edge , which forces the electrons to obey the usual fermionic abelian statistics . on the contrary , in the @xmath0 models , the electrons are also non - abelian ( @xmath155 ) ; actually , the relation with wave functions is not immediate : we have compared the correlator ( [ elco ] ) with the jain composite - fermion wave functions , which have been recently written in the first landau level @xcite .",

    "<S> this reduction of degrees of freedom can also be implemented by adding a relevant interaction to the hamiltonian , leading to a renormalization - group flow between the two theories . </S>",
    "<S> next , a physical interpretation of the constraints is obtained by representing the quantum incompressible hall fluids as generalized fermi seas . </S>",
