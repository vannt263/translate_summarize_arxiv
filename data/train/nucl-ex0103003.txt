    "the beta - decay lifetime of the neutron is of interest in a number of contexts .",
    "it has a direct impact on cosmological modeling as an input to the calculation of the production of light elements during the big bang .",
    "the isotopic ratios measured in extragalactic gas clouds ( in which isotopic abundances are thought to have remained constant since the big bang ) can be compared to big bang nucleosynthesis calculations in order to place limits on the ratio of baryons to photons in the early universe . in the calculation of the expected @xmath3he/@xmath4h ratio ,",
    "the dominant uncertainty is the lifetime of the neutron@xcite .",
    "beta decay of the neutron is both the simplest nuclear beta decay , and more generally , the simplest of the charged - current weak interactions in baryons .",
    "measurements of the weak interaction parameters can be obtained using neutron beta decay with fewer and simpler theoretical corrections than measurements using the beta decay of nuclei .",
    "the neutron beta decay rate is proportional to the quantity @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the semileptonic vector and axial - vector coupling constants . to extract the coupling constants uniquely from neutron beta - decay measurements requires either an independent measurement of @xmath6 or @xmath7 or of the ( more experimentally accessible ) ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the technique of magnetic trapping offers the promise of significant improvements over previous measurements in the accuracy of the neutron lifetime ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "past measurements have relied on two techniques for measuring @xmath9 : beam and closed - sample type measurements . at present ,",
    "both techniques appear to be systematically limited at the @xmath10 level .    in a beam measurement ,",
    "a well collimated cold neutron beam passes continuously through a decay region of known volume .",
    "each neutron decay occurring in that volume is counted . at the end of the decay region , the flux of the neutron beam",
    "is measured with a 1/@xmath11 weighting , where @xmath11 is the velocity .",
    "the neutron lifetime is ideally given by the ratio of the number of decays per unit time to the number of neutrons in the decay region .",
    "in the most precise measurement to date using this method ( @xmath12  s @xcite ) , neutron decays were counted by detecting the decay protons and the beam flux was measured by detecting @xmath13-particles emitted in the @xmath14 reaction . of the 4.8  s uncertainty , 3.4  s is attributed to systematic effects in the measurement of the neutron flux .",
    "an improved version of this experiment ( presently running at the national institute of standards and technology , nist ) aims for an accuracy of less than two seconds@xcite .    in the closed - sample measurements , neutrons with energies lower than the interaction potential of the material ( i.e.  ultracold neutrons or ucn )",
    "are loaded into a physical box and stored ( via total reflection of the neutrons from the material surfaces ) for a variable length of time before being counted .",
    "the neutron lifetime can be extracted from the dependence of the detected neutron population on the storage time .",
    "several storage techniques have been used to make measurements of the neutron lifetime .",
    "the most precise storage measurements yielded values of @xmath15  s@xcite , @xmath16  s@xcite and @xmath17  s@xcite .",
    "experiments using this storage technique to measure the neutron lifetime measure the total rate at which neutrons are lost from the storage vessel , both by beta decay and by any other loss mechanisms .",
    "the accuracy of the lifetime measurement is limited either by unknown loss mechanisms or by the uncertainty in corrections for large loss mechanisms which arise from the interactions between the stored neutrons and the walls of the storage vessel .",
    "most experiments use storage data to extrapolate to the ideal case of no wall losses . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the physical size of the storage vessel is varied , and the measurements are extrapolated to an infinite volume . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the storage time is measured as a function of ucn velocity , and an extrapolation is made to zero velocity , or an infinite time between collisions with the walls .",
    "the most recent measurement , @xcite , uses two different storage - vessel sizes with neutron detectors to measure the relative rate at which neutrons are scattered out of the storage vessel in the two configurations .",
    "a second storage technique uses the interaction of the magnetic moment of the neutron with magnetic field gradients .",
    "this technique was first discussed by vladimirski@xmath18 in 1961@xcite , just two years after zeldovich first discussed material storage@xcite . since that time",
    "there have been several experiments to store neutrons magnetically with varying degrees of success@xcite .    in the nestor ( neutron storage ring ) experiment , neutrons in a range of velocities from 6  m  s@xmath19 to 20  m  s@xmath19 were stored in a sextupole magnetic storage ring analogous to the storage rings used at particle accelerators@xcite .",
    "magnetic field gradients reflect neutrons at a glancing incidence , storing neutrons in certain trajectories .",
    "the storage ring technique relies on the stored neutrons to remain in these trajectories .",
    "neutron loss from these trajectories ( attributed to betatron oscillation ) limited this measurement .",
    "three - dimensional magnetic trapping was later attempted with a spherical hexapole trap@xcite .",
    "the lack of neutrons trapped in this experiment was attributed to upscattering of neutrons from the trap by phonons in their 1.2  k helium bath .",
    "another experiment used a large ( @xmath20  @xmath21 ) box with several current loops providing the magnetic field for confinement along the floor and walls ( the top was `` closed '' by gravity ) . despite its size",
    "it was never able to confine more than a few ( of order one ) neutrons at a time due to its a trap depth of @xmath22k@xcite .    the use of three - dimensional magnetic confinement to measure the neutron lifetime provides an environment that is free of the systematic effects that have limited previous lifetime measurements .",
    "the magnetic trapping technique is not sensitive to variations in the neutron flux ; each decay is recorded as a function of time and both the lifetime and initial number of neutrons can be extracted .",
    "magnetic trapping also eliminates wall interactions and betatron losses ; neutrons are not confined by physical walls and are energetically forbidden from leaving the trapping region .",
    "these advantages should allow for a significant improvement in the accuracy of the neutron lifetime .",
    "given a sufficient neutron flux it should be possible ( using estimates of known loss mechanisms discussed below ) to measure @xmath9 at the @xmath23 level .",
    "the method of measuring the neutron lifetime using magnetic trapping that is discussed in this paper was proposed in 1994@xcite .    in this work",
    "ultracold neutrons are produced , magnetically trapped , and detected as they decay .",
    "the experimental concepts are discussed in section  [ sect : idea ] .",
    "a description of the experimental apparatus is given in section  [ sect : app ] .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sect : res ] , with a discussion of these results in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the feasibility of using an improved version of this experiment to make a neutron lifetime measurement is discussed in section [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "the techniques developed for this experiment have other potential fundamental physics applications , also discussed in section [ sect : conclusion ] , such as improved sensitivity in the search for the neutron s electric dipole moment@xcite or detection of low energy neutrinos@xcite .",
    "neutrons have a magnetic moment , @xmath24 , and interact with a magnetic field , @xmath25 , by the dipole interaction : @xmath26 where the magnetic moment of the neutron is oriented anti - parallel to its spin ( @xmath27 ) . when the neutron spin is aligned parallel to the magnetic field the interaction energy is positive and regions of high magnetic field repel neutrons in the parallel spin state .",
    "these neutrons are denoted `` low - field seekers '' .",
    "static magnetic traps create a magnetic field minimum in free space to confine low - field - seeking particles .",
    "one such trap , known as an ioffe trap , conceptually ( and in our case schematically ) consists of four wires and two coils as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ioffe ] .",
    "this configuration has been used to confine ions and plasmas and more recently to trap neutral atoms@xcite .",
    "the four wires with alternating current direction provide a cylindrical quadrupole field .",
    "the two coils , coaxial with the same current sense , provide a non - zero field throughout the trapping region .",
    "our magnet is of this form and is described further in section  [ sect : app ] .",
    "the interaction potential given in eq .",
    "[ eq : magint ] also causes the component of the magnetic moment perpendicular to the field to precess around the local direction of the field with a frequency @xmath28 ( @xmath29  mhz at 1  t ) . if this precession is considerably faster than the change in the direction of the field seen by the neutron , that is if @xmath30 then the neutron spin will remain aligned with @xmath25 as it moves throughout the trap ( i.e.  the neutron spin state will not change relative to the field ) . under these conditions",
    ", one can essentially view the magnetic potential , @xmath31 , as depending only on the magnitude , not the direction , of the magnetic field .",
    "near regions in which the field approaches zero this condition is not fulfilled and trapped , low - field - seeking neutrons can invert their spin and be lost from the trap ( majorana spin - flip losses ) .",
    "provided @xmath32 is sufficiently large ( i.e.  no zero - field regions ) a neutron initially in the trapped state will remain in the trapped state as it moves throughout the trap .      to load neutrons into the trap their energy must be dissipated inside the trapping region .",
    "the `` superthermal '' process ( so called because it allows one to achieve phase space densities greater than that coming from a `` thermal '' liquid hydrogen or deuterium cold source ) is an efficient method to load the trap@xcite .",
    "the superthermal production of ucn in superfluid helium depends critically on the fact that cold neutrons can not scatter with individual helium atoms as they would in a gas , but must scatter with excitations ( phonons and rotons ) in the superfluid .",
    "the dispersion curve ( energy versus momentum ) for these excitations in superfluid helium@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] with the energy of the free neutron ( @xmath33 ) overlaid for comparison . for a neutron to scatter to the vicinity of @xmath34 via the dominant single phonon scattering process , momentum and energy conservation limit the initial neutron momentum to values of @xmath35 .",
    "this results in the creation of a single 12  k phonon in the helium .",
    "similarly , a ucn with @xmath36  mk can only `` upscatter '' by absorbing a 12  k phonon ( ignoring multi - phonon processes for the moment ) .",
    "this fact allows one to treat the neutron interaction with the superfluid as a two level system with a 12  k energy difference between the two levels .",
    "and at @xmath37 , which corresponds to a neutron wavelength of 0.89  nm , or an energy of 12  k. ]    the one - phonon upscattering rate can be expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "for a fixed @xmath40 ( 12  k in our case ) , the upscattering rate can be made arbitrarily small since it decreases exponentially with the temperature @xmath41 of the helium bath .",
    "physically this corresponds to decreasing the population of phonons of energy @xmath40 . in practice",
    ", however , the rates of other ( multi - phonon ) scattering processes dominate the upscattering rate at low temperatures .",
    "the second - order process is denoted as two - phonon upscattering , although it applies equally to the scattering of a neutron by a single phonon , in which the phonon is not absorbed .",
    "the rate of the two - phonon upscattering scales as @xmath42@xcite and has been measured down to 500  mk @xcite . in a helium bath at a temperature of 1.16  k ,",
    "the upscattering rate was @xmath43  s@xmath19 , corresponding to a storage time of 40  s. at our operating temperature of 250  mk , the upscattering rate should be 2000 times less than the beta - decay rate .",
    "minor modifications to the apparatus now allow the helium to be cooled below 100  mk , making the two - phonon upscattering rate negligible in performing a lifetime measurement .",
    "the use of superfluid helium to produce ucn has been demonstrated in several previous experiments@xcite and upscattering rates have been measured in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "when a neutron decays in the trap , the recoiling electron scatters from atomic electrons of the helium , ionizing tens of thousands of helium atoms .",
    "the electron deposits 300  kev  cm@xmath19 in the helium with the range of a typical electron of order 1  cm@xcite .",
    "the helium ions tend to form diatomic molecular ions before recombining with electrons , leading to the creation of excited - state diatomic helium molecules .",
    "these molecules are created in both singlet and triplet states .",
    "when each helium molecule decays it emits a photon in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ; @xmath45  nm ) .",
    "the singlet decays give a relatively intense pulse of light in a short time ; 4000  euv photons in less than 20  ns for a typical neutron decay@xcite .",
    "these singlet decays and are used to detect the neutrons decaying in the trap .",
    "the longer decay time for the triplet states renders them less useful for this purpose . the same number of photons emitted over 13  s@xcite makes it impossible to distinguish the triplet events from backgrounds .",
    "to detect the light pulse emerging from the singlet decays directly in the trap would require euv sensitive detectors that work at low temperatures ( @xmath46  mk ) , in liquid helium , and inside an intense magnetic field ( 1  t ) .",
    "the detectors would also be exposed to the cold neutron beam , or at least to neutrons scattering in the helium , and would need to tolerate this radiation without creating backgrounds . finally , there is limited space available inside the magnet bore .",
    "since it is extremely difficult to satisfy these detector requirements , the scintillation light is detected indirectly .",
    "the euv scintillation light is converted to blue / violet light inside the apparatus using a pure hydrocarbon , 1 - 1 - 4 - 4 tetraphenyl 1 - 3 butadiene ( tpb ) .",
    "tpb absorbs euv light and emits light in a spectrum ranging from 400  nm to 500  nm@xcite .",
    "this light can then be transported out of the trapping region and into detectors at room temperature .",
    "the detector insert is described in detail in section  [ sect : app ] .",
    "each experimental run consists of a loading phase in which the neutrons are loaded into the trap and an observation phase in which the trapped neutrons are detected as they decay . at the start of a run",
    "the magnetic field is on forming the magnetic trap which will confine the neutrons .",
    "the neutron beam is turned on and neutrons begin to scatter in the liquid helium , producing ucn which become confined in the trap .",
    "the ucn creation rate is proportional to the incident neutron flux and is constant during the loading phase .",
    "ucn are lost from the trap by beta decay in proportion to the number trapped .",
    "thus , neutrons accumulate in the trap with a time constant of the neutron lifetime or approximately 15  min . in the actual experiment ,",
    "the trap is loaded for 22.5  min , yielding 78  % of the trapped ucn population that could be achieved with an infinite loading time .",
    "once the beam is turned off , the number of neutrons in the trap decreases due to beta decay .",
    "the photomultiplier tubes are turned on 10  s after the beam is turned off and neutron decays are detected for 1  h , giving a time - varying signal directly proportional to the decreasing number of neutrons in the trap .",
    "trapped neutrons are indicated by an exponentially decaying signal consistent with the neutron beta - decay lifetime , or a more rapid decay if there are additional trap losses .",
    "two classes of problems could prevent observation of this signal : spurious losses ( which cause the initial trapped population to be significantly lower due to losses during loading ) and background events ( which could give a much higher overall counting rate and obscure a trapped neutron signal ) .",
    "the next two subsections will treat these two issues .",
    "known loss mechanisms include one- and two - phonon upscattering ( which as discussed above is reduced by cooling the helium target ) , majorana spin - flips ( which are minimized by the non - zero - field character of the trap ) , and @xmath47he absorption . in addition , some neutrons with energies greater than the trap depth ( that is , sufficient to allow them to escape ) may be confined by the field for an extended period of time but escape from the trap before they decay .",
    "helium has two stable isotopes , @xmath47he and @xmath3he .",
    "while @xmath3he does not absorb neutrons , @xmath47he has an extremely high absorption cross - section",
    ". for ucn contained within a bath of @xmath3he with a small amount of @xmath47he present , the absorption rate is given by : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the ratio of @xmath47he atoms to @xmath3he atoms , @xmath50 is the density of helium nuclei , @xmath51 is the thermal cross section for neutron capture onto @xmath47he and @xmath52 is the neutron velocity at room temperature .",
    "isotopically purified @xmath3he is available with @xmath53@xcite . at this limit , the absorption rate is @xmath54 , or ten thousand times less than the beta - decay rate .",
    "this gives a negligible shift in the trap lifetime .",
    "`` reversing '' this analysis allows the data presented in section  [ sect : res ] to yield a three standard deviation upper limit on the @xmath47he concentration of @xmath55 .",
    "a more accurate , independent measurement of @xmath49 using accelerator mass spectroscopy is presently being pursued .",
    "a `` marginally trapped '' neutron is one with an energy greater than the trap depth , but in a trajectory that keeps the neutron confined in the trapping region for a significant time .",
    "simulations have determined that the vast majority of these neutrons will be expelled from the trap within a few seconds@xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown through analytical calculations@xcite that by lowering the magnetic field to 30  % of its original value and then raising it back up , a trapped sample is achieved that has no neutrons stored with energies above the trap depth and about one - half of the original trapped neutrons .",
    "for this demonstration of trapping , this procedure is not necessary .",
    "background events are any events recorded by the data acquisition system that arise from sources other than decaying neutrons .",
    "the data acquisition system records an event when coincident pmt pulses above a set charge threshold occur on the two photomultipliers observing the trapping region .",
    "events which are coincident with the detection of light pulses from pmts observing plastic scintillator paddles placed below the primary detection cell are vetoed .",
    "hence the detection system is designed to reject several expected backgrounds .",
    "cosmic ray muons pass through materials at a rate of 1  @xmath56  min@xmath19@xcite and penetrate any reasonable shielding .",
    "they leave an ionization trail as they pass through , depositing roughly 2  mev  g@xmath19@xmath57 times the density of the material@xcite .",
    "pulses in the primary detection system due to cosmic ray muons are vetoed by the auxiliary paddles and do not produce background events .",
    "the requirement of coincidence between two pmts observing the trapping region suppresses background events caused by neutron induced luminescence of materials .",
    "the neutron absorbers used to shield the materials surrounding the trapping region from the neutrons ( primarily hexagonal boron nitride , hbn ) glow after exposure to neutrons with a magnitude decreasing slowly on a time scale comparable to an experimental run@xcite .",
    "this luminescence ( which was for some time the major obstacle to extracting the trapped neutron signal ) was attenuated by placing graphite between the hbn and the light collection system and by replacing the collimator and beam stop with b@xmath58c ( a material which has considerably less luminescence ) . to suppress this background , coincident detection in two pmts is employed .",
    "a signal is recorded when at least two photons are detected in each pmt within a 23  ns window . with this threshold ,",
    "the efficiency for detecting neutron decays is 31  % .",
    "the system is also susceptible to background events from other sources .",
    "the passage of high - energy particles through any part of the trapping region or detection system is expected to cause scintillations in the primary pmts .",
    "other than cosmic ray muons which are vetoed , any particle that causes a detected scintillation will produce a background event .",
    "such particles include decay products from radioactive nuclei , either naturally occurring or created by neutron capture during the loading phase , and neutral particles ( gamma rays or fast neutrons ) created outside of the apparatus . unlike muons , gamma rays and fast neutrons tend to lose a significant fraction of their energy in each scattering event and can not be detected with veto detectors .",
    "to reduce background events from gamma rays , the apparatus is shielded with 10  cm of lead .",
    "backgrounds from decays of isotopes created by neutron absorption decay exponentially with their respective lifetimes . to minimize such backgrounds ,",
    "the materials exposed to the neutron beam are carefully chosen such that their primary constituents have small neutron absorption cross sections ( or absorb neutrons to form a stable isotope , thus giving no background ) .    despite several successful methods of reducing backgrounds , a decaying signal with peak magnitude of roughly 0.2  s@xmath19 had to be extracted from a time - varying background signal of about 6  s@xmath19 initially , with a constant component of 2  s@xmath19 at longer times .",
    "this was accomplished by measuring the background directly , taking half of the runs with the magnetic trap initially turned off , and subtracting this background from the trapping runs .",
    "the experiment resides at the end of cold neutron guide number six ( ng-6 ) in the guide hall of the nist center for neutron research ( ncnr)@xcite .",
    "neutrons are released from the 20  mw reactor and are moderated by d@xmath59o surrounding the reactor core and then by a liquid hydrogen cold source operating at a temperature of 20  k. neutrons partially thermalize with the hydrogen and exit towards the neutron guides .",
    "some fraction of these neutrons pass into the open end of ng-6 , a rectangular @xmath60ni - coated guide 60  m long , 15  cm tall and 6  cm wide .",
    "neutrons exiting the far end of ng-6 pass through a 6  cm diameter collimating aperture ( @xmath61 ) and then through filtering materials consisting of 10  cm of bismuth and 10  cm of beryllium .",
    "the single crystal bismuth attenuates the flux of gamma rays from upstream sources .",
    "the polycrystalline blocks of beryllium bragg - reflect neutrons with wavelengths less than 0.395  nm , removing them from the beam .",
    "the neutron beam exiting the filter has a measured capture flux of @xmath62  n  @xmath56s@xmath19@xcite .    immediately preceding the trapping region , a second aperture ( @xmath63 )",
    "collimates the beam before it enters the trapping region .",
    "the collimators @xmath61 and @xmath63 are chosen such that any neutron passing through both collimators will be absorbed in the beamstop at the end of the trapping region unless it scatters in the helium .",
    "the wavelength spectrum of the beam is measured in a separate experiment by the time - of - flight method .",
    "the beam is collimated to a diameter of 400  @xmath64 m . a cadmium disc positioned directly behind the collimator and rotating at 67  hz blocks the beam except when either of a pair of slits 250  @xmath64 m wide passes in front of the collimator .",

    "the background count rate remained the same , thus even with four times as many runs , the signal extracted from the second set of data is statistically equal to that from the first set .    353 pairs ( trap - on and trap - off ) of data runs were taken , 87 with a trap depth of 0.75  mk and 266 with a trap depth of 0.5  mk .",

    ", a time - varying background can be seen as well .",
    "each of these two components of the background arises from different sources .",
    "the flat background in the earliest runs of the cycle was 1.4  s@xmath19 , but rose quickly to 1.8  s@xmath19 by the second day , and averaged 2  s@xmath19 over the entire data set .",
    "this shift was due to the slow buildup , from neutron activation , of radioactive nuclei with lifetimes greater than one day .",
    "approximately 0.6  s@xmath19 of the flat background arises from such long - lifetime activation .",
    "the remaining 1.4  s@xmath19 of the flat background probably arises from both gamma rays penetrating the lead shielding around the cryostat and any long - lived radioactive isotopes ( such as uranium or thorium ) naturally occurring in the materials of the apparatus or shielding . without further measurements ,",
    "the possibility that the majority of the present `` flat '' background comes from naturally occurring radioactive isotopes in our apparatus can not be ruled out .",
    "the time - varying component of the background could include the activation of shorter - lived isotopes , either main constituents of the apparatus or trace impurities in or near the detector .",
    "no single isotope appears to dominate this component of the background , as it did not fit well to a single exponential .",
    "any remnant of the luminescence signal ( discussed below ) will also decrease with time , though this signal should be eliminated by the multiphoton threshold and requirement of coincidence between two pmts .",
    "neutron absorption in the hbn ( and perhaps other materials ) creates color centers which relax by emitting light@xcite .",
    "this luminescence signal varies with time , temperature and magnetic field , and is therefore the most problematic of our backgrounds .",
    "cuts which were required to reduce the luminescence background also eliminate about two - thirds of the events arising from trapped neutrons .",
    "in addition , the temperature dependence of the luminescence makes the `` warm '' data , in which the helium was warmed to 1.2  k , potentially suspect ( although unlikely to be so ) .",
    "thus , because of the luminescence , data in which the helium were doped with @xmath47he was taken to confirm the presence of trapped neutrons .    since",
    "the luminescence most likely results from the recombination of electrons and holes in the boron nitride , it should emit single photons uncorrelated in time .",
    "neutron decays on the other hand result in several photons being detected in coincidence between the two pmts , providing an easy way to distinguish the neutron decay signal from the luminescence background . in practice ,",
    "the rate of the luminescence signal is more than five orders of magnitude greater than the trapping signal . with a single - photon counting rate of 50,000  s@xmath19 in each pmt",
    ", the accidental coincidence rate ( with a coincidence window of 43  ns ) is 100  s@xmath19 , three orders of magnitude larger than the expected neutron decay signal .",
    "even the probability of three single photons arriving independently within the coincidence window is larger than the expected trapped neutron signal .",
    "the luminescence background can be reduced to a tolerable level ( assuming that the luminescence photons are always uncorrelated ) by requiring coincidence between four photons ( corresponding to less than two false coincidences in each 1  h run ) . recalling that a neutron decay in the center of the trapping region emitting a 330-kev electron will produce on average a signal of five photoelectrons , a 4 p.e .",
    "threshold is a strenuous constraint .    in practice",
    ", such a reduction in the luminescence background can not be obtained by setting a four - photoelectron threshold on a single photomultiplier tube because there is not a sharp distinction between a three- and a four - photoelectron event . even with a higher threshold , a single photoelectron event can result in a much larger `` afterpulse '' in the pmt@xcite .",
    "this afterpulse results from contamination of the pmt vacuum over time ( especially by helium , which diffuses through glass ) and occurs between 400  ns and 600  ns after the initial pulse .",
    "the size of the afterpulsing effect was studied by illuminating a pmt with light from an led ( light - emitting diode ) at low current ( and thus , producing predominantly uncorrelated single photons ) . from the pulse - height distribution",
    ", it is determined that between 2 % and 4 % of the presumably single photon pulses generated a multiple photon afterpulse . to eliminate these backgrounds , two separate photomultiplier tubes in coincidence",
    "are used , with a threshold of two photoelectrons on each .",
    "[ fig : differencedata ] shows the pooled background subtracted data ; i.e.  the difference between the pooled trap - on data and the pooled trap - off data , divided by the number of runs which were pooled together .",
    "the following models are simultaneously fit to the data : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the experimental counting rate and the subscripts correspond to the first and second reactor cycle .",
    "the @xmath98 s correspond to the amplitude of the neutron decay signal , @xmath99 corresponds to the lifetime of the neutrons in the trap ( assumed to be the same in each reactor cycle ) and the @xmath100 s correspond to any residual offset between trap - on and trap - off runs , which could arise from small changes in the `` flat '' background rate over the course of many runs .",
    "the data from each cycle are binned into seventy 50  s bins , with the first starting 50  s after the beam is turned off .",
    "the five parameters , @xmath101 and @xmath99 are varied using a routine adapted from the grid fit algorithm described in ref.@xcite to minimize the chi - squared ( @xmath102 ) of the fit .",
    "the values of the fit parameters are those which yield the minimum @xmath102 , and the 68  % confidence interval for each parameter is given by the range over which the @xmath102 ( varying the other four parameters ) increases by one relative to the minimum ( varying all five parameters ) .",
    "the fit gives a minimum @xmath102 of 150.67 with 135 degrees of freedom at@xcite : @xmath103 note that @xmath104 and @xmath105 are significantly above zero , indicating trapped ucn are present in the trap .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig : differencedata ] are evidence of an increase in the counting rate in runs in which the magnetic trap is turned on .",
    "however , from this evidence alone we can not definitely conclude that the increase represents an additional source of counts from trapped ucn as opposed to , for example , small , magnet - dependent changes in the rate of neutron - induced backgrounds .",
    "it has been assumed that the trap - on data contain both the neutron decay signal and background events , while the trap - off data contain no decay events , but the same backgrounds .",

    "similarly , the neutron beam , which causes all the time - varying backgrounds , must remain unchanged as well .",

    "first , the error bars on the measurement quoted in eq .",
    "[ fitvals ] may seem discouraging , compared to the weighted world average value of @xmath139  s@xcite . however , the uncertainty in the present data is due entirely to statistical fluctuations in the large backgrounds being subtracted and not from the number of trapped ucns .",
    "there is every reason to believe that a large reduction in at least the time - varying background is possible , since these backgrounds are created by neutrons of all wavelengths , while the trapped ucn are produced by neutrons in a narrow band around 0.89  nm .",
    "thus , a 0.89  nm nearly monochromatic beam should reduce these backgrounds by almost two orders of magnitude relative to the neutron signal .",
    "the flat background can be reduced by increasing the detection efficiency , allowing higher rejection thresholds to be set . presently , the efficiency is 31  % , mainly limited by the transport of the blue light down the tube surrounding the trapping region .",
    "an increase in the wall thickness of the tube will not only allow efficiencies @xmath140  % , but will allow the thresholds to be raised , thereby lowering the backgrounds .",
    "the detection efficiency may also be raised by using an optically transparent beamstop rather than the opaque b@xmath58c beamstop .",
    "lastly , the number of trapped ucn could be increased by building a magnetic trap either physically larger than that described here , `` deeper '' ( in terms of magnetic trap depth ) , or both .",
    "the number of trapped ucn is approximately proportional to the volume of the trap ( @xmath141 ) and to @xmath142 .",
    "in fact , collimation constraints in setups of our type make the ucn population depend slightly more strongly on @xmath143 and less so on @xmath144 .",
    "the present magnet has a bore of 5.08  cm and the diameter of the trap is 3  cm . in a larger - bore magnet , this ratio will substantially improve , giving a trap depth that is a larger fraction of the field at the bore of the magnet .",
    "an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude in the number of trapped ucn , giving a potential measurement at the 1  s level , is likely in the next few years .",
    "ultimately , this method of measuring the neutron lifetime is limited by losses of neutrons from the trap , which would give the appearance of a lifetime shorter than the actual beta - decay lifetime .",
    "ways in which neutrons could be lost from the trap , other than beta - decay , include : scattering by excitations in the liquid helium , absorption by @xmath47he , majorana spin - flip transitions and the marginal trapping of neutrons .",
    "scattering of trapped neutrons by excitations in the liquid helium can be reduced to below @xmath23 of the beta - decay rate by cooling the helium to below 150  mk @xcite .",
    "absorption by @xmath47he is reduced by using isotopically purified @xmath3he . at the level to which the supplied @xmath3he has been verified@xcite , a limit of @xmath145 of the beta - decay rate can be set .",
    "the actual purity is probably better and will be measured using accelerator mass spectrometry .",
    "majorana spin - flip transitions occur near zero - field regions and can be suppressed in an ioffe trap by the application of a bias field .",
    "marginally trapped neutrons can be eliminated by ramping the magnetic field down to 30% of its maximum value and then back up , resulting in a population of ucn all with energies less than the trap depth and thus all truly trapped .",
    "the beta - decay lifetime of a neutron in a bath of liquid helium could in principle differ from that of a neutron in vacuum due to either a change in the available phase space for the decay products or a change in the matrix element that governs the decay .",
    "small changes in the phase space factor arise from an increased or decreased amount of energy available to the decay products .",
    "for example , the minimum energy of the electron in helium is 1.3  ev@xcite .",
    "the net effect of this energy difference is to increase the neutron lifetime by at most @xmath146 .",
    "we estimate that all of the phase - space effects are less than @xmath23 .",
    "also , the matrix element for the decay could be influenced by the presence of the helium nuclei .",
    "the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath7 is known to vary by 26% compared to that of muon decay@xcite .",
    "we can estimate the effect of such a change by considering the range of the strong force ( @xmath147  m ) and the density of helium nuclei in the neutron s environment .",
    "the effect of the helium nuclei in the environment of the neutron should be @xmath148 .",
    "there is no reason to expect any of these effects , or the loss mechanisms mentioned above , will prevent a measurement of the neutron lifetime at the @xmath23 level , given sufficient statistics .",
    "in addition to the immediate use of trapped ucn in a measurement of the neutron lifetime , the techniques developed for this experiment are applicable to a wide range of future experiments .",
    "the detection of euv scintillations in liquid helium ( or neon ) using wavelength shifters has been proposed for use in a solar neutrino experiment@xcite .",
    "also , both the production and storage of ucn in a helium bath and the detection techniques described herein are relevant to a proposed experiment to measure the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron using polarized ucn in a bath of liquid helium@xcite .",
    "the apparatus described above could also be readily adapted for use as a relatively strong source of polarized ucn .",
    "this source of perfectly polarized ucn could be useful in the determination of correlation coefficients in neutron decay which can be combined with @xmath149 to test the standard model .",
    "a ucn beam could also be used as a probe for the investigation of condensed matter , because the ucn s wavelength is comparable to interesting correlation lengths in crystalline , polymeric and biological materials .",
