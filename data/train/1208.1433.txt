    "the perihelion precession of planetary orbits and the bending of light by a massive star were examined a long time ago in the context of einstein s general theory of relativity ( @xcite@xcite ) in a schwarzschild metric for the background spacetime . since then , there have been various proposals of alternative theories of gravitation beyond einstein s gravity . especially in the context of string theory the effects of the extra scalar field , namely , the dilaton , lead to a new model of gravity in the low - energy effective theory in four dimensions ( see gibbons and hull ( @xcite , @xcite ) , hawking ( @xcite ) , witten ( @xcite ) , mayers et.al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) and chandrasekhar and hartle ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition there are some other higher order gravity theories which admit spherical symmetry for the spacetime . among them",
    "einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet ( henceforth referred to as emgb ) theory ( see @xcite , @xcite ) and spherically symmetric solution in quadratic gravity ( see @xcite , @xcite ) are of utmost importance .",
    "+ in this paper , we present a general formalism based on the perturbative method to determine the timelike or null geodesics and estimate the perihelion precession and light bending for alternative gravity theories . among them",
    "one very important candidate is dilaton gravity in the presence of a @xmath0 gauge field which yields a charged black hole solution in the low - energy limit of string theory compactified to four dimensions .",
    "such a solution has been analyzed in great detail by garfinkle , horowitz and strominger @xcite ( see also coleman @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that , while in the case of a pure reissner - nordstrm ( r - n ) solution the bending of light , in the leading order , is similar to the schwarzschild scenario , it differs significantly for a charged dilaton coupled solution .",
    "for such a solution the bending angle depends nontrivially on the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton which is a measure of string coupling .",
    "we have also presented the calculation of the perihelion shift and bending of light for the emgb gravity theory where we have a higher order gauss - bonnet term and action for an electromagnetic field .",
    "the natural coupling in this type of theory is the inverse of string constant @xmath1 , which we have estimated by using known observational results . for the emgb theory",
    "we have also obtained that the shift decreases with charge of the black hole as in the r - n scenario ; however the expression for the bending angle of light differs significantly and increases with the coupling @xmath1 .",
    "recently yunes and stein ( see @xcite ) have obtained spherically symmetric solution in quadratic gravity in the context of dynamical theories .",
    "we have used that solution to calculate the perihelion shift and bending of light and obtained nontrivial results .",
    "our results further reveal that while for r - n spacetime the perihelion shift decreases with increase in electric charge , for a dilaton coupled electromagnetic background it increases with the electric charge .",
    "+ as an illustration , we first very briefly present the perihelion precession and bending of light in a reissner - nordstrm geometry and then extend our calculations for alternative theories of gravity .",
    "our analysis includes charged dilaton black hole , the emgb gravity theory , and a spherically symmetric solution in quadratic gravity . in every case we have tried to estimate a bound on different coupling parameters which represent the characteristic scale of the corresponding model beyond einstein gravity .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion on our results .",
    "the metric for a r - n black hole is given by ( see @xcite , @xcite )    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath4 is the charge . since the metric does not contain @xmath5 and @xmath6 explicitly , the corresponding two conserved quantities are the energy and angular momentum such that    @xmath7    here @xmath8 is the mass of the particle , @xmath9 is the energy per particle mass , @xmath10 is the angular momentum per particle mass , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the components of four - momentum . in our chosen unit system , mass has same dimension as energy and @xmath9 is dimensionless",
    ". we shall use @xmath13 for massive particles and @xmath14 for massless photons .",
    "also , we can choose the motion of the particle in the equatorial plane ( @xmath15 ) ( see @xcite , @xcite ) such that @xmath16 .",
    "the geodesic equation can be obtained by using the energy - momentum relation @xmath17 and defining @xmath18 where @xmath19 is some affine parameter connected with the proper time of the particle . then using the metric coefficients and the energy - momentum relation we get an expression for @xmath20 . to eliminate @xmath19",
    ", we introduced @xmath21 , and finally by simple algebraic manipulation with a substitution @xmath22 we arrive at ,    @xmath23    here@xmath24 denotes derivative with respect to @xmath6 . on further differentiation and keeping terms @xmath25",
    ", we arrive at    @xmath26    where we have taken @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that after each revolution the period of @xmath6 changes by a small amount , i.e. , @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the measure of perihelion precession which depends on @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . by using the perturbation method ,",
    "the solution for @xmath34 is taken to be @xmath35 .",
    "then , by keeping terms linear in @xmath33 ( since @xmath36 as well as the quantity @xmath37 are small ) , we obtain    @xmath38    note that the solution of an equation of the form @xmath39 will be nonresonant when the @xmath40 term vanishes ( see @xcite ) , which in turn implies @xmath41 .",
    "hence the perihelion precession would be    @xmath42    [ fig1 ]       figure 1 : the figure shows the variation of the perihelion shift with charge .",
    "thus for the r - n case the shift is given by    @xmath43    figure 1 depicts how the perihelion shift decreases with an increase in charge of the source . from eq .",
    "@xmath44 we see that for a given @xmath45 the perihelion shift @xmath46 decreases with @xmath4 due to the negative sign in front . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the curve in the figure touches the @xmath48 axis which corresponds to the value of @xmath46 for the schwarzschild scenario .",
    "for example , if we took @xmath49 , then the curve should touch the @xmath48 axis at @xmath50 , i.e. , at @xmath51 , which can be observed from the figure .      to estimate the bending of light we can write the null geodesic as    @xmath52\\ ] ]    simple algebra , as shown in the previous section ,",
    "leads the above expression to    @xmath53    where @xmath54 .",
    "equation ( @xmath55 ) indicates that the term that contains @xmath4 is of the order of @xmath56 and therefore has a very negligible influence on the measure of bending of light when the minimum distance of approach is large .",
    "note that the term containing @xmath57 also appears in the massive case .",
    "however there we have a factor of @xmath58 , which makes a nonzero contribution from that term .",
    "hence we can conclude that for r - n geometry the bending of light is almost identical to that of a schwarzschild black hole at a sufficiently large distance from the source such that terms beyond the leading order , i.e. , @xmath59 can be ignored .",
    "static uncharged black holes in general relativity are described by schwarzschild solution .",
    "if the mass of the black hole is large compared to the planck mass , then this also , to a good approximation , describes the uncharged black hole in string theory except regions near a singularity .",
    "however , the einstein - maxwell solution for the string - inspired theory differ widely from the known classical solution due to dilaton coupling .",
    "the dilaton coupling with electromagnetic field tensor @xmath60 implies that every solution with nonzero @xmath61 will come with a non zero dilaton .",
    "thus the charged black hole solution in general relativity ( which is the reissner - nordstrm solution ) appears in a new form in string theory due to the presence of the dilaton .",

    ", we have @xmath77 and can deduce that there exist only three independent components for the ricci tensor , namely , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "we can also show from eq .",

    "using these equations and ( [ n1 ] ) , we can find out the spherically symmetric solution ( see garfinkle , horowitz and strominger @xcite )    @xmath84    where , @xmath85 .",
    "once again due to isometry , we have taken our motion in the equatorial plane such that @xmath86 . here",
    "@xmath87 is the asymptotic value of the dilaton , and @xmath4 represents the black hole charge .",
    "note that this is almost identical to the schwarzschild metric , with a difference that areas of spheres of constant @xmath75 and @xmath5 now depend on @xmath4 .",
    "in particular the surface @xmath88 is singular , and @xmath89 is the regular event horizon .",
    "the evolution of the scalar field @xmath69 may also be derived from the field equations mentioned before eq .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) and the solution given by    @xmath90    hence , as @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "we can define the dilaton charge as    @xmath93    where the integral is over a two sphere at spatial infinity and @xmath94 is the normal to the two sphere at spatial infinity . for a charged black hole we could compute this by using eq .",
    "( [ n1]b ) and the expression for a purely magnetic maxwell field @xmath76 , which leads to    @xmath95    this indicates that the matter particle feels the presence of the dilaton with a coupling modified by @xmath96 . here",

    "( @xmath120 ) it is evident that the perihelion shift increases with the asymptotic value of dilaton , which is shown explicitly in fig .",
    "2 .       figure 2 : the figure shows the variation of perihelion shift with a dilaton field for different choices of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "it may be observed that the perihelion shift increases very fast with an increase on dilaton strength and also increases with an increase in charge of the star or the black hole .",
    "note that both the r - n solution and the dilaton solution describe a black hole with mass @xmath3 and charge @xmath4 only when @xmath121 is small ; otherwise they describe naked singularity . however , we have an important difference between these solutions , as in this case there is no analog of the inner horizon which exists for the r - n scenario .",
    "but , for string theory , the statement that the horizon is singular when @xmath122 is actually irrelevant , since the strings do not couple to the metric @xmath70 but rather to @xmath123 .",
    "this metric appears in the string @xmath124 model . in terms of the string metric ,",

    "@xmath127 where we have just rescaled the metric by some conformal factor which is finite everywhere outside and on the horizon .",
    "if we try to calculate the perihelion precession by using this metric following the same method , we arrive at the same result presented by eq . @xmath128 .    from the available experimental data on the perihelion precession of mercury",
    ", the error bar is estimated as @xmath129 arcsec / century .",
    "so we can estimate a bound for the dilaton charge , which is @xmath130 .",
    "this clearly explains why the stringy signature can still not be determined within the precision of the present day astrophysical experiments .",
    "figure 3 : the figure shows the variation of bending of light with a dilaton strength for different choices of mass and charge .    for the null geodesic the orbit equation yields    @xmath131    introducing @xmath132 ,",
    "i.e. , angular momentum per unit energy or , equivalently , angular momentum per particle mass , we obtain    @xmath133    by neglecting terms of order @xmath59 , the above differential equation can be integrated such that    @xmath134    where @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the lower limit @xmath137 represents the position of the photon when it does not feel the presence of the field , i.e. , at @xmath138 .",
    "the upper limit yields the minimum distance of approach , which in this case is the solution of the equation @xmath139 . using these we determine the bending of light as    @xmath140    where @xmath141 .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath142 this vanishes , which is consistent , since in eq .",
    "( @xmath143 ) we have eliminated the @xmath59 term which appears in the schwarzschild case . as we have neglected the dominant term in the schwarzschild case ( @xmath144 ) , we should not expect the schwarzschild result to be retrieved .",
    "thus , the above bending is dependent crucially on the dilaton asymptotic value and comes from a more dominant term ( @xmath25 ) than that in the schwarzschild scenario .",
    "so this bending can be interpreted as a signature of a string - inspired dilaton spacetime . here",
    "( [ n3 ] ] where @xmath97 is the dilaton charge . using this",
    "we finally obtain    @xmath146    with @xmath147 defined after eq .",
    "( [ 43a ] ) .",
    "however , the above solution is valid for @xmath148 . for the other choice",
    "the bending of light is given by    @xmath149    where @xmath150 .",
    "this also vanishes in the limit @xmath151 and hence is consistent with the above analysis .",
    "the first solution is applicable when the @xmath152 of the particle is much greater than the dilaton strength , and the second condition is just the reverse of the first condition .",
    "following the classic test of general relativity by cassini spacecraft @xcite , we could put bounds on the dilaton charge @xmath97 .",
    "the quantity @xmath153 could be calculated as @xmath154 .",
    "then , following the constraint put on this @xmath155 by cassini @xcite , we get , @xmath156 .",
    "this bound on @xmath97 is distinctly several orders larger than the bound derived from the perihelion precession test .",
    "however one should also need to consider damour - polyakov mechanism , which generates a screening effect and may keep the estimate within experimental bounds ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "string - loop corrections of low - energy matter couplings of the dilaton provide a mechanism to fix the vacuum expectation value of the massless dilaton , compatible with existing experimental data . by using some assumptions regarding the universal nature of the dilaton coupling function ,",
    "it is possible to show that the cosmological evolution of a graviton - dilaton - matter system drives the dilaton to a value when it decouples from matter , called the least coupling principle @xcite .",
    "the origin of this evolution is explained as follows : masses of different particles depend on the dilaton @xmath6 , while the source for the dilaton mass is the gradient of @xmath6 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising to have a fixed point where the gradient of @xmath6 is zero leading to a massless dilaton .",
    "this mechanism is similar to the generic attractor mechanism in scalar tensor theories discussed in ref .",
    "other types of couplings of a long - range scalar field @xmath6 atre given as a universal multiplicative coupling of @xmath6 to all the other fields , where @xmath157 with @xmath158 admitting a universal extremum .",
    "the universal coupling function @xmath158 can be expanded in powers of @xmath159 in the small coupling limit , i.e. , @xmath160 or , equivalently , @xmath161 such that @xcite    @xmath162    in the low - energy limit of the underlying string theory , which is the one we are discussing here , or equivalently the coupling constant , @xmath160 leads to the first term in the above equation to be the dominant one validating our results . in this limit",
    "we may ignore the backreaction of the other terms in the expansion of @xmath158 on the metric and can use the form of the metric discussed in ( @xmath163 ) .    in the low - energy limit",
    "the original damour - polyakov action written in the `` string frame '' can be reduced to that in the `` einstein '' frame with a conformal transformation such that the action in the einstein frame is identical to that of the effective low - energy lagrangian used in this section @xcite .",
    "this justifies the use of the damour - polyakov mechanism to lower the bounds on the dilaton charge .",
    "we summarize in qualitative terms the basic reasons why a massless dilaton is rendered nearly invisible during its cosmological evolution : ( i ) during the radiation era , when the universe passes through a temperature @xmath164 , the @xmath31-type particles and antiparticles become nonrelativistic before annihilating and hence disappearing from the cosmic soup ; this provides a source term for the dilaton , which attracts @xmath6 toward a minimum @xmath165 of @xmath166 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite this attraction mechanism is efficient .",
    "( ii ) in the subsequent matter era , @xmath6 will be continuously attracted toward a minimum of the mass function @xmath167 corresponding to the matter dominating the universe .",
    "( under the same universality condition this minimum will be again @xmath168 . ) thus , by , following this damour - polyakov mechanism it is possible to reduce the dilaton charge beyond the experimentally observable value by the screening effect ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "hence the effective bound on dilaton charge is lower than estimated bound following the mechanism illustrated above .",
    "we , however , reiterate that the angle for the bending of light increases in magnitude with the dilaton strength ( see fig .",
    "3 ) and also with the electric charge .",
    "theories with an extra spatial dimension have been an active area of interest ever since the original work of kaluza and klein and the advent of string theory , which predicts the inevitable presence of an extra spatial dimension . among many alternatives ,",
    "the brane world scenario is considered as a strong candidate within some theoretical basis in some underlying string theory .",
    "usually , the effect of string theory on classical gravitational physics ( see @xcite , @xcite ) is investigated by means of a low - energy effective action , which in addition to the einstein - hilbert action contains squares and higher powers of curvature term .",
    "however , the field equations become fourth order and bring in ghosts ( see @xcite ) . in this context , lovelock ( see @xcite ) showed that , if the higher curvature terms appear in a particular combination , the field equation become second order and consequently the ghosts disappear .    in emgb gravity , the action in five - dimensional spacetime ( @xmath169 ) can be written as    @xmath170,\\ ] ]    where @xmath171 is the gb lagrangian and @xmath172 is the lagrangian for the electromagnetic field . here",

    "we finally obtain    @xmath278    from this equation we see that the second term in the right - hand side expression increases with @xmath279 , while the other two terms decrease",
    ". however if @xmath9 is greater than 1 then all terms are positive .",
    "so the perihelion shift depends on the energy of the particle .",
    "also since we have kept terms linear in @xmath279 ( the metric itself is valid for linear terms in @xmath279 ; see @xcite ) , the shift varies linearly , but whether it will increase or decrease depends on the energy value .    in this case",
    ", we can estimate the parameter @xmath279 using the fact that perihelion precession measurements for mercury show an error bar of 3 arcsec / century . then using the above expression for the perihelion precession we can limit @xmath279 to a small value of @xmath280 .",

    "also @xmath219 and @xmath220 are the energy and angular momentum , respectively , of the photon under consideration .",
    "this equation can be integrated to obtain the bending angle as    @xmath283    here @xmath137 represents the asymptotic value of the inverse radius from where the photon approaches . since the solution is asymptotically flat this value is @xmath104 to be precise .",

    "the bending depends on the leading order term @xmath25 and we have kept terms just up to that order .",
    "so in the limit of @xmath285 the bending angle of light vanishes .",
    "this shows that the parameter @xmath279 provides a longer range effect on bending of light than the schwarzschild mass does .",
    "so we again have an instance where the bending angle is coming from a purely string theory effect in a modified schwarzschild solution in the presence of quadratic gravity .",
    "in this paper , we have considered various alternative theories of gravity which have their roots in some underlying string theory .",
    "considering three such variants , we have explored the influence of various modifications beyond einstein gravity on the perihelion shift and lensing . from the present available data for these phenomena , we have established a bound on the characteristic parameter of each model . for a dilaton",
    "coupled charged solution , our work brings out the possibility of a stringy signature and also shows a remarkable feature that the dilaton vacuum expectation value , which decides the magnitude of the bending angle ( though suppressed by the scale of the theory ) , has its presence at one order lower in @xmath34 than the pure schwarzschild scenario .",
    "this implies the possibility of having a more pronounced stringy effect than the pure einstein gravity .",
    "the dependence of the bending angle as well as the precession angle with a dilaton vacuum value has also been determined for different values of mass and charge . for the precession angle",
    "the charge dependence turns out to be opposite to that in r - n scenario , indicating that the dilaton coupled charged spacetime solution belongs to a new class of solutions other than the ordinary r - n scenario .",
    "next in our analysis we have explored the role of the gauss - bonnet term at higher order .",
    "the modification of the perihelion shift due to this additional term puts a stringent bound on the parameter of the gb coupling .",
    "the cassini effect as well as the damour - polyakov mechanism have been discussed in this context . finally , we have considered quadratic gravity in a spherically symmetric spacetime . here",
    "also a bound on the parameter of the model has been established after a critical analysis .",
