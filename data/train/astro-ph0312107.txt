    "pulsars fall into two quite distinct categories : young objects with relatively low spin rate  standard pulsars ; and much older objects spinning several hundred times per second  the so - called millisecond pulsars .",
    "the majority of known pulsars fall into the former category and are distributed across the galactic disk as expected for objects that have originated fairly recently ( 10@xmath3  10@xmath4 years ) from massive stellar supernovae .",
    "the millisecond pulsars have quite a different distribution , but which can also be understood by looking at their progenitors .",
    "srinivasan & van den heuvel ( 1982 ) and alpar et al . ( 1982 ) proposed that the millisecond pulsars have been spun up to high rotation rates during an accretion phase as a member of low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems .",
    "the tendency for millisecond pulsars to be found in globular clusters is seen as a natural consequence of the high incidence of lmxb systems in such clusters . of the galactic globular clsuters , 47 tucanae dominates as the host of at least 22 pulsars ( manchester , 2000 ) .",
    "this number is large enough that it presents the possibility of certain population studies , some of which have been addressed by camilo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and friere et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the number of potentially observable pulsars in 47 tucanae .",
    "we use the term `` potentially observable '' ( sometimes simply `` observable '' ) for pulsars whose emission beam passes over the earth and so could be detected with a sufficiently sensitive telescope .",
    "the probability that any pulsar is potentially observable depends on the angular width of its emission beam , and the fraction of all pulsars that are observable relates to some population average ( latitudinal ) beam width .",
    "camilo et al . have estimated the total number of potentially observable pulsars in 47 tuc to be @xmath5200 .",
    "they base their estimate on the supposition that the cluster pulsars are distributed in luminosity according to the law observed for the standard pulsars in the galactic disk .",
    "that is , their differential luminosity distribution is assumed to be consistent with @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of pulsars and @xmath8 their luminosity .",
    "camilo et al . also assumed that the pulsars extend in luminosity down to the lower limit observed in the galactic pulsar population , measured at 400  mhz , of @xmath9 .",
    "the determination of the luminosity distribution for a population of pulsars is a difficult process ( see for example lyne , manchester & taylor , 1985 ) for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , the distance to each pulsar in the sample must be known .",
    "this is usually inferred from the observed dispersion of the pulsar signal and estimates of the free electron density along the interstellar line of sight and is often given with large uncertainty .",
    "secondly , any sample is incomplete because of observational selection effects .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the fainter pulsars in the population and introduces extra uncertainty in the measured luminosity function at the low - luminosity end of the distribution .",
    "a measurement of the total radio flux from the core region of 47 tucanae would , if the form of the pulsar flux distribution were known , provide an estimate of the lower limit to the distribution and of the number of pulsars in the cluster . specifically , if the cluster contains the estimated 200 observable pulsars and if the flux distribution as assumed by camilo et al .",
    "is followed , the total radio flux from the pulsars in the cluster core should be @xmath54  mjy  double that of those already detected . here",
    "we report observations designed to be sensitive to such a distribution of 20  cm emission from the core .",
    "the observations reported here were made with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in low resolution ( short baseline ) configurations and are complementary to earlier higher resolution atca observations reported by mcconnell & ables , 2000 ( referred to hereafter as ma2000 ) and mcconnell , deacon & ables , 2001 ( mda2001 ) .",
    "the observed radio luminosity of a pulsar is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is its radio flux and @xmath12 its distance from the observer .",
    "@xmath8 is usually expressed in the units mjy  kpc@xmath13 .",
    "the distance to 47 tuc is @xmath14  kpc ( zoccali et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "in equation ( 2 ) , the distance @xmath12 to all pulsars in 47 tuc is effectively the same .",
    "given the angular spread on the sky of the 47 tuc pulsars @xmath15 , and assuming the distribution to be symmetrical , the spread in pulsar distance @xmath16 is negligible . in the following",
    "we describe the distribution of radio fluxes , and in conclusion give the equivalent parameters of the luminosity distribution for comparison with the general pulsar population .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the population of standard pulsars in the galactic disc has a luminosity distribution consistent with equation 1 .",
    "it is useful to write explicitly the underlying frequency distribution and to determine whether the 47 tuc pulsars with known fluxes also belong to a population consistent with that relation .",
    "we write the frequency distribution of pulsars , @xmath17 , with radio flux @xmath11 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total size of the pulsar population .",
    "the cumulative frequency distribution @xmath20 , ie .",
    "the number of pulsars with flux density greater than @xmath11 , is then @xmath21 for @xmath22 . after taking the logarithm",
    "we get @xmath23 which , in differential form , corresponds to equation 1 .",
    "for such a distribution , the integrated flux of all pulsars with flux above some limit @xmath11 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 .    to verify that equation 6 describes the sample of pulsars already detected in 47 tuc",
    ", we have analysed their fluxes reported by camilo et al .",
    "we give their cumulative flux distribution @xmath20 in figure 1 , which shows that pulsars with @xmath26 follow the assumed law .",
    "fainter pulsars appear to be less numerous , as might be expected either because of approaching the sensitivity limit of the detection equipment or because the intrinsic lower flux limit is being approached .",
    "we have fitted the cumulative distribution for @xmath27 ( 9 pulsars ) to an expression of the form @xmath28 and find that @xmath29 , @xmath30 , consistent with equation 6 . constraining the distribution to follow equation 6 exactly ( @xmath31 )",

    "the aim of the observations reported here was to detect radio emission from the core of 47 tucanae .",
    "the likely distribution of pulsars in the cluster has already been indicated by the positions of the brighter members as determined from pulse timing analysis ( freire et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "we sought to detect the integrated emission of a possibly larger population of pulsars sharing this spatial distribution .",
    "all pulsars lie within 3.2 @xmath35 of the cluster centre , where the core radius @xmath36  ( howell , guhathakurta & gilliland , 2000 ) . we therefore chose to use the australia telescope compact array in the 0.75 and 0.375 configurations to give sensitivity to brightness distributions of order @xmath550  in size .",
    "the observations were made over a bandwidth of 128  mhz centred at 1.408  ghz ( @xmath37 20  cm ) .",
    "the miriad data reduction package was used to calibrate the data and form images .",
    "the antenna gains were calibrated using brief observations of the source b2353 - 696 ( @xmath38jy ) .",

    "subtract from the low resolution visibility data , a set of point source responses with the measured fluxes at the corresponding pulsar locations .",
    "* subtract from the low resolution visibility data all source components detected in the high resolution image outside the circular region centred on the core with radius @xmath41 .",
    "* subtract an additional source ( s176 in mda2001 ) which lies within @xmath41 of the cluster centre .",
    "this source was discussed in mda2001 .",
    "it lacks variability , has a flat spectrum and is not suspected of being a pulsar . *",
    "derive the low resolution image from the modified visibility dataset , and measure the flux of all emission within @xmath41 of the cluster centre .",
    "* correct this figure for the flux scale diferences between the atca and parkes measurements ( see section [ calibration ] ) . * add the mean flux , as reported by camilo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , of each pulsar detected and subtracted in the first two analysis steps above .",
    "figure 3 shows the central part of 47 tucanae at 20  cm before ( left ) and after ( right ) the pulsar and source removal described in section [ method ] .",
    "significant emission is visible from only a small part of the @xmath42 circle around the cluster centre and the total radio flux is much less than the @xmath54  mjy expected if the predicted @xmath5200 pulsars exist in the cluster .",
    "the total flux measured in the residual image inside the @xmath41 circle is @xmath43 .",
    "the uncertainty is calculated from the observed brightness noise in the image ( 0.06  mjy / beam ) , the error in determination of the bright pulsar flux , and an estimate of the likely difference in flux of a 48-hour integration from the long term mean flux of the weaker , unsubtracted pulsars ( see section [ variability ] and equation ( 11 ) ) .",
    "converting the measurement to the parkes flux scale using the factor derived in section [ calibration ] , we have @xmath44 .",
    "thus the total 20-cm radio flux is    @xmath45     circle , pulsars c , d , e , f and j , and source s176 ( see text ) .",

    "the vertical line indicates the likely lower bound to the flux of pulsars in the cluster .",
    "it is unlikely that the flux distribution extends below @xmath54  mjy , corresponding to an upper bound for the pulsar population size of @xmath2 .",
    "this result is consistent with the possibility that there are no further radio pulsars to be detected in 47 tuc .",
    "the minimum luminosity of this distribution is @xmath55 at 1400  mhz .",
    "pulsar luminosities are often referred to 400  mhz with a spectral index of @xmath56 assumed to allow conversion : @xmath57 . using this approach we estimate the lower limit of 400  mhz luminosity of the 47 tuc pulsar population to be @xmath58 .     of pulsars in 47 tuc as measured by camilo et al . , 2000 .",

    "the horizontal dotted line shows the @xmath61 upper bound .",
    "the vertical dotted line indicates the likely lower bound to the pulsar flux distribution.,title=\"fig:\",width=317 ]",
    "in this work we have estimated two parameters of the population of pulsars in 47 tucanae : the lower bound to its luminosity distribution @xmath62 and its size @xmath7 , the total number of observable pulsars in the cluster .",
    "our technique is similar to that used by fruchter and goss ( 1990 ) who made measurements of integrated flux densities of a number of globular clusters and estimated the number of pulsars in each cluster .",
    "fruchter and goss used a luminosity function corresponding to equation 3 with an assumed value of @xmath63 , the luminosity of the weakest millisecond pulsar known at the time of their work . in the case of 47 tuc",
    ", we have used our measurement of the integrated flux and also the measured fluxes of the brightest members of the population to constrain both n and @xmath62 .",
    "we find @xmath64 , significantly greater than the value assumed by fruchter and goss .",
    "as we noted in the introduction , the determination of the radio luminosity distribution of pulsars is frustrated by uncertainties in pulsar distances and the difficulty of defining a sample free of strong selection effects . to make this determination usefully for all currently known millisecond pulsars is probably impossible .",
    "the pulsars in 47 tuc provide the best opportunity available at present to characterise the radio luminosities of millisecond pulsars , and perhaps of pulsars in general .",
    "if we accept the inferences made about the luminosity function of the 47 tuc pulsar population , then the least luminous members of the population are nearly an order of magnitude brighter than the weakest pulsars in the general galactic population .",
    "we speculate that the origin of this difference relates more to the distinction between standard and millisecond pulsars , than to the different locations of the sample populations .",
    "the radio luminosity of an individual pulsar is expected to decline steadily , in accord with declining rotational energy .",
    "ultimately the rotational energy reduces to the point of being insufficient to power the radio emission mechanism , and the pulsar crosses the `` death line ''  see for example the discussion by chen and ruderman ( 1993 ) . as a class ,",
    "the millisecond pulsars have very small values of @xmath65 , so that their evolution towards the death line is very slow .",
    "the characteristic age at which a pulsar crosses the death - line ( which also corresponds to a fixed mechanical luminosity line ) , can be shown to be inversely proportional to its magnetic field strength .",
    "hence , compared to normal pulsars the age at which radio millisecond pulsars die would be several orders of magnitude longer .",
    "perhaps the relatively high low - luminosity bound inferred for the 47 tuc pulsars indicates how much additional time is required for them to evolve through lower luminosities to the death line .",
    "most energy lost from a pulsar is radiated in the form of low frequency `` dipole radiation '' , generated by the rotation of the star s magnetic field and observable as the gradual increase in rotation period .",
    "a tiny fraction of the energy loss is visible in the radio spectrum .",
    "real physical insight might be expected from successfully connecting , through measurement , the radio luminosity with the total energy loss rate .",
    "the pulsars in 47 tuc present us with a measurable radio luminosity distribution at 1.4  ghz .",
    "grindlay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimated energy loss rates @xmath66 of the pulsars after assuming that the location of each pulsar in the cluster s gravitational potential can be estimated from its differential dispersion measure .",
    "if the total radio luminosities could be inferred from the 1.4  ghz measurements and the likely beam solid angles , some attempt could be made to connect them to the estimates of @xmath66 .",
    "finally we note that x - ray detection provides an alternate means of estimating the total population of 47 tuc .",
    "grindlay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have reported _ chandra _ observations and place an upper limit of 90 pulsars in the cluster .",
    "the x - rays are attributed to thermal emission from the polar cap and are not beamed . adopting the upper limits of 90 x - ray and 30 radio pulsars , and assuming the x - rays",
    "are not beamed , the implied radio beaming factor is @xmath67 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have determined a lower bound to the luminosity of pulsars in the globular cluster 47 tucanae .",
    "if this bound is typical of millisecond pulsars in general , then it would imply a considerably smaller number of pulsars in globular clusters than believed earlier .",
