    "optical properties are of broad fundamental and practical interest . for example , they determine the color of everyday objects ; they dictate the absorption and transfer of photons by and between chromophores embedded in protein environments ; and they control the fluorescence behavior of molecules used as markers in biomedical imaging applications .",
    "these diverse phenomena ( and many others ) are in fact united by the same underlying quantum mechanics describing electronic excitations and their consequences .",
    "the ability to reliably and quantitatively predict these neutral excitations from computer calculations is an important goal , and several competing methods for this purpose are in use today . besides the wavefunction - based methods which are computationally - intensive and thus often limited to relatively small systems , two main formalisms are present in the literature : time - dependent density functional theory ( td - dft)@xcite and the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse)@xcite approach from many - body perturbation theory .",
    "both approaches have been widely used but for different classes of systems : td - dft is primarily for molecules , and bse for solids.@xcite td - dft has thus far been applied with great success to the calculations of the low - lying excitations of isolated molecules .",
    "it is a computationally attractive method that can be used efficiently even for relatively large systems , and performs particularly well when paired with a hybrid exchange correlation ( xc ) functional.@xcite however , td - dft , with standard hybrids , can be challenged by rydberg final states and charge transfer excitations.@xcite these failures can be tempered by employing xc approximations that contain the full long - range exact exchange contribution , as do the tuned - cam - bl3yp,@xcite bnl,@xcite and ot - rsh functionals.@xcite however , and despite interesting proposals @xcite , for solids no purely _ ab initio _ approximation to td - dft is available to date , since the content of long - range exact exchange in solids should be modulated by the system - dependent dielectric constant.@xcite    likewise the bse , whose solution is the two - particle electron - hole green s function , also accounts for the screened electron - hole interaction ; the bse framework has been shown to be extremely successful in predicting the optical spectra of bulk solids@xcite and of low - dimensional materials.@xcite in part inspired by recent interest in organic - based energy conversion materials , bse has begun to be applied to finite organic molecular systems as well.@xcite relative to standard contemporary td - dft approaches , the bse method has many attractive features : through the _ ab initio _ calculation of the screened coulomb interaction , the electron - hole interaction has the correct asymptotic behavior independent of the system , be it a bulk solid , a low - dimensional nanostructure or polymer , or a molecule .",
    "this feature results , for instance , in a correct description of charge transfer excitations in molecules.@xcite    additionally , the description of neutral excitations within the bse are built upon a foundation of charged excitation energies , corresponding to electron addition or removal , determined within the @xmath0 approximation@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 approach is known to yield much more accurate values of the fundamental ( or quasiparticle ) gap energy for a variety of systems than , e.g. , dft .",
    "this is in contrast with td - dft for which underlying kohn - sham eigenvalues have little physical meaning.@xcite only the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) energies can be safely interpreted as the negative of ionization potential ( ip ) and the negative of electron affinity ( ea ) in a generalized kohn - sham scheme ( gks ) ( including hybrid functionals).@xcite all the other eigenvalues are not , strictly speaking , observables , although recent work on tuned range - separated hybrids suggests that both quasiparticle gaps and outer valence spectra from a gks approach can be in quantitative agreement with photoemission and @xmath0 calculations .",
    "@xcite    for these reasons , the bse approach is increasingly being used to predict excitation energies for molecules and is an alternative to td - dft . however , there are , to date , no general assessments of the quality of bse results for low - lying neutral excitations of isolated molecules .",
    "although several benchmarks of td - dft have been reported detailing its accuracy for different choices of xc functional relative to wavefunction - based methods,@xcite no such systematic effort has been undertaken for the bse approach . here",
    ", we evaluate the accuracy of bse neutral excitations compared to values for 28 small organic molecules calculated by thiel and coworkers with high - level wavefunction - based methods .",
    "@xcite this set of 28 molecules , hereafter referred to as `` thiel s set '' , includes 103 singlet and 63 triplet excitations , all computed with multiple coupled - cluster level methods.@xcite following prior studies with td - dft , we benchmark to theoretical values , rather than experimental data : the compared calculations employ the same basis set , all atomic positions are identical , vibrations and temperature effects are neglected , and there is no solvent or other environmental conditions . with this benchmark , we are able to provide a general assessment , as well as guidelines and rationale for the successful application of bse to molecular systems .",

    "the bse , when using a static approximation , is completely analogous to td - dft expressed through casida s equations.@xcite here we describe the most salient features of a typical bse solution in its most common practical implementation.@xcite    figure  [ fig : bse_flowchart ] shows a flowchart of a bse evaluation of neutral excitation energies .",
    "the calculation consists of 3 main steps : a self - consistent mean - field dft calculation in the gks scheme ; a perturbative @xmath0 calculation to obtain the quasiparticle energies ; and a final bse solution to produce the excitation energies @xmath2 and the corresponding oscillator strengths @xmath3 .",
    "the initial dft step is denoted gks since the starting mean - field might be standard kohn - sham with a local xc approximation , or it might be derived from a more general hybrid functional or even hartree - fock . this first step produces eigenvalues and wavefunctions that are used to evaluate the screened coulomb interaction @xmath4 and the @xmath0 self - energy .",

    ", the bse can be recast into a matrix form in a transition space spanned by the orbital products @xmath21 where pairs of states @xmath22 and @xmath23 are either occupied / unoccupied or unoccupied / occupied . thus the bse results in an eigenvalue problem with the same block form as the td - dft equations @xmath24 where @xmath2 are the neutral excitations and @xmath25 are the eigenvectors .",
    "the complex conjugation has been dropped because the wavefunctions are assumed to be real - valued .",
    "just as in td - dft , the upper block @xmath26 accounts for resonant transitions from occupied to unoccupied orbitals , whereas the lower block @xmath27 accounts for the antiresonant transitions , and the two types of transitions are coupled through the blocks @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the neglect of the coupling @xmath28 leads to the tamm - dancoff approximation.@xcite    the only difference between td - dft and bse lies in the specific expression of the matrix elements in @xmath26 and @xmath28 . in bse",

    "the eigenvalue problem posed by the bse as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bse_blocks ] ) is numerically cumbersome : the matrix size grows as the square of the number of atoms ( 2 times the number of occupied states times the number of unoccupied states ) and it is furthermore a non - symmetric eigenvalue problem .",

    "( [ eq : bse_blocks ] ) .",

    "note that in td - dft , @xmath37 is a diagonal matrix and its square root is readily obtained .",
    "however recent work@xcite has proven that cholesky decompositions can be a work - around to avoid this second diagonalization",
    ".    a td - dft calculation would be essentially identical to this except that the eigenvalues entering in @xmath26 would be gks eigenvalues instead of quasiparticle energies from a gw approxomation , and except that the @xmath4 term would be replaced by the xc kernel @xmath42 ( with a different index ordering ) .",
    "having reviewed the bse formalism , we will turn to the practical application of it to thiel s set .",
    "]    in the present study we evaluate the quality of the bse neutral excitation energies for thiel s set of 28 small organic molecules.@xcite    our calculations are performed with the molgw code@xcite which is an implementation of @xmath0 and bse many - body perturbation theory with gaussian basis functions .",
    "molgw relies on an external library , libint,@xcite to evaluate the coulomb integrals .",
    "the xc energies , potentials , and kernels for different starting gks dft mean - fields are obtained from the libxc library.@xcite the philosophy behind molgw is to prioritize accuracy and ease of development over computational efficiency , and thus molgw is suitable for small molecular systems .",

    "btes are theoretical values that have been corrected with some human intuition about the usual discrepancy between these methods and reality . indeed , bte values most often lie outside the range of the calculated values .",
    "note that , consistent with the thiel group s subsequent td - dft study,@xcite we disregarded the tabulated double excitation of tetrazine ( c@xmath45n@xmath46h@xmath45 ) which so far could not be captured by td - dft or bse .",
    "this explains why we refer to 103 tabulated values instead of the 104 that appear in the original work .",
    "the original calculations performed on thiel s set used the so - called tzvp basis set of alrichs and coworkers.@xcite this relatively limited basis was used so that the highly demanding calculations required to build the btes were feasible . for the sake of comparison",

    "because the error of all these methods with the tzvp basis agree within 0.1  ev , we expect our calculations to trend across theoretical schemes .",
    "the thiel group has also shown that the conclusions drawn from the smaller tzvp basis remain valid with the larger aug - cc - pvtz basis set that includes diffuse functions .",
    "@xcite    with these preliminaries done , we are now ready to analyze the performance of bse for the 28 selected molecules of thiel s set .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : bse_flowchart ] , the bse excitation energies rely on eigenenergies and wavefunctions from a prior self - consistent gks dft calculation . as mentioned , a strong dependence of the @xmath0 quasiparticle energies on the dft starting point has previously been discussed in the literature ; @xcite thus it is not surprising that bse excitation energies , which are built upon @xmath0 quasiparticle energies ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bse_flowchart ] ) will also exhibit such a dependence . although the influence of the dft starting point was mentioned in earlier works,@xcite , to date , no systematic quantitative study has been performed .",
    "hereafter , we will assess the bse via evaluation of their deviation from the reference btes of thiel s set for both singlet and triplet excitations .",

    "bse@pbe consistently yields singlet excitation energies that are too low : almost all data points are below the diagonal .",

    "bse@b3lyp also yields excitation energies that are too low .",

    "unfortunately , our bse calculations show a trend very analogous to td - dft for triplets . from the correlation plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thiel_triplet_bse ] , we see that all bse triplet excitations are too low , regardless of the initial gks starting point .",
    "once again , the excitation energies are well fitted by a straight line , however with a slope that departs from unity .",
    "the slope ranging from 0.88 for pbe to 0.97 for tcam - b3lyp shows that the error is not perfectly constant across the excitation energies : the larger excitation energies have a greater error .",
    "as expected , bse@pbe produces the poorest triplet excitation energies of all .",
    "hybrid functionals with some exact exchange ( bhlyp and tcam - bl3yp ) improve results relative to the bte , but the quality of the calculated triplet excitation energies is poorer than for singlets .    the errors shown in fig .

    "it is interesting to identify which step introduces the noticeable starting point dependence we highlighted above . or , another way of posing the same question would be : which among ( a ) @xmath0 quasiparticle energies and ( b ) the bse solution is the most sensitive to the gks input ?    to address this question , we need `` best theoretical estimates '' for the quasiparticle energies too . although it is not possible to easily access all quasiparticle energies , the homo and lumo energies can be obtained via total energy differences with the so - called @xmath50scf procedure . to obtain accurate results",

    "the @xmath50scf procedure requires three separate total - energy calculations for evaluation of the homo - lumo gap : one for the neutral molecule , and additional calculations for the cation and anion .",
    "note that the underlying hartree - fock self - consistent field calculations have been carefully checked against molgw , since the cation and anion cases can be challenging and quite often converge to local minima .",

    "[ fig : thiel_homolumo_gw ] .",

    "even @xmath0 on hartree - fock ( @xmath0@hf ) does a decent job for the gaps , as highlighted in ref .  .",
    "it is worth noting that the trends for the homo - lumo gaps are the same as those for singlet excitations .",

    "[ fig : thiel_gw_bse ] .",
    "our results from bhlyp and tcam - b3lyp are the most adequate for both singlet and triplet quasiparticle energies : these are the closest to the origin of fig .",
    "[ fig : thiel_gw_bse ] .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between the @xmath0 and singlet bse errors is almost perfect : the slope of a line fit to these data is 1.02 .",
    "this means that the starting point dependence of bse is inherited entirely from the @xmath0 quasiparticle energies , and for thiel s set , the bse singlet excitations are seen to be constant shifts applied to the @xmath0 energies .",
    "it is unexpected that the details in bse are so insensitive to the starting point .",
    "indeed , the screened coulomb interaction @xmath4 used in eqs .  ( [ eq : bse_elementsa]),([eq : bse_elementsb ] ) is obtained within the random - phase approximation of the underlying gks dft calculation , and therefore also varies with starting point .",
    "moreover , @xmath4 from pbe would be expected to lead to more significant screening than a @xmath4 constructed from bhlyp , since the homo - lumo gaps of these two approximations largely differ .",
    "but obviously , these differences are too subtle at the short ranges at play in these small molecules to influence the bse results .",
    "the bse triplet results can be seen as slightly more correlated to the type of @xmath4 , but the slope of a line through these data ( @xmath51 ) is still very close to unity .    finally , from fig .",
    "[ fig : thiel_gw_bse ] , we observe that the intercept of the line fit to the errors differs from zero for both singlets , 0.24  ev , and triplets , -0.36  ev . from this analysis , we can quantify the magnitude of intrinsic errors to bse .",
    "indeed , even with a perfect @xmath0 approach that produces zero error compared to the ccsd(t ) homo - lumo gaps , the bse singlet / triplet energies would still deviate from those of the best theoretical estimate by 0.2 - 0.3  ev .",
    "in addition , the singlets and triplets have opposite signs , indicating that the bse singlet - triplet splitting can be expected to be systematically overestimated by about 0.6  ev .",
    "furthermore , this conclusion holds independent of starting point since the error lines are nearly parallel .",
    "it is enlightening to carry out the same analysis for td - dft .",
    "it is legitimate to do so because in a gks scheme , be it exact or approximate , the non - local exchange - correlation operator does not have a derivative discontinuity.@xcite when combining this statement with the piece - wise linearity of the total energy , both the gks homo eigenvalue should be equal to minus the ip and the gks lumo eigenvalue should be equal to minus the ea within the exact gks scheme .",
    "there is no fundamental difference between the ip and the ea . as a consequence , an accurate xc functional in the gks scheme",
    "should yield frontier eigenvalues that compare well with the btes for the homo - lumo gap .",
    "the td - b3lyp results yield almost perfect singlet excitation energies with a mse value of -0.08  ev .",
    "however , b3lyp produces homo and lumo gks eigenvalues that strongly deviate from the @xmath50scf ccsd(t ) reference .",
    "the mse for b3lyp homo - lumo gap is as large as -5.1  ev for the molecules in thiel s set .",
    "given our bse results , this strongly suggests that its accurate singlet excitation energies can be ascribed to a significant cancellation of errors .",
    "though b3lyp and other similar xc functionals provide a good estimate of singlet excitation energies , this agreement is not supported by a satisfactory theoretical basis .",
    "having an xc approximation that yields both correct homo - lumo gaps together with high quality neutral excitations is quite possible , as shown by the promising recent advances associated with the ot - rsh functional.@xcite    in sum , the dependence of bse excitation energies on the dft starting point can be primarily ascribed to the underlying @xmath0 quasiparticle energies .",
    "the bse step itself has a systematic bias towards an overestimation of the singlet energies and an underestimation of the triplet energies .",
    "although both errors are rather small ( 0.2 - 0.4  ev ) , they lead to overestimated singlet - triplet splittings .",
    "however , the bse error in the singlet - triplet splitting is of the same order of magnitude as the best td - dft schemes .",
    "finally , the agreement of the td - dft approximation with the reference singlets has been shown to rely on a cancellation of significant errors , a cancellation that may be less complete by excitations that deviate from the simple nature of those considered here , for example in molecules more complex than for the small molecules in thiel s set .",
    "in this article , we have evaluated the performance of bse for singlet and triplet excitation energies of thiel s set of 28 small organic molecules .",
    "the quality of our bse results is found to be sensitive to the chosen dft gks starting point .",
    "semi - local starting points , such as pbe , fail significantly for the molecules in thiel s set .",
    "hybrid functional starting points in general produce much better results . among the hybrid functionals ,",
    "those containing a large contribution from exact exchange ( bhlyp or tcam - bl3yp ) perform best .",
    "we would advocate the use of such functionals ( or similar ones ) in future bse studies .",
    "the dependence on the starting point can be connected to the different content of exact exchange in each functional .",
    "this sensitivity , though important , is not more significant than the one observed for xc functionals in td - dft .",
    "the performance of bse for singlets is clearly superior to its performance for triplets .",
    "the same statement holds for td - dft .    when analyzing the origin of the error with homo - lumo gaps evaluated from @xmath50scf based on ccsd(t ) , we found that the entire bse starting point dependence originates with the @xmath0 quasiparticle energies .",
    "the details of screened coulomb interaction @xmath4 used in the bse kernel is not significant for the small molecules in thiel s set .",
    "thus , maximizing the accuracy in quasiparticle energies should minimize the error in bse .",
    "however , residual errors in bse are non - vanishing . for the best quasiparticle energies , we predict",
    "that singlets would be over - estimated by 0.2  ev and triplets would be underestimated by @xmath52  ev .",
    "future investigation of the limitations of the bse for singlet - triplet splitting would be desirable .",
