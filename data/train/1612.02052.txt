    "gauge theories constitute the backbone of the standard model of particle interactions .",
    "gauge theories exist in several different phases that are naturally classified according to the force measured between static sources .",
    "knowledge of the phase diagram proves crucial when investigating extensions of the standard model both for particle physics and cosmology .",
    "a special class of gauge theories are the ones that are fundamental according to wilson @xcite , meaning that they possess a complete ( in all couplings ) ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point either of non - interacting ( asymptotically free @xcite ) or of interacting nature ( asymptotically safe @xcite ) .",
    "complete asymptotically safe quantum field theories were discovered only very recently @xcite , widening the horizon of fundamental theories that can be used for novel phenomenological applications @xcite beyond the traditional asymptotically free paradigm @xcite .",
    "the thermal properties of completely asymptotically safe field theories were elucidated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we focus our attention on asymptotically free gauge theories featuring gauge and fermion degrees of freedom that develop an infrared ( ir ) interacting fixed point .",
    "we henceforth push forward our program to systematically understand , in a rigorous manner , the dynamics of these theories at zero @xcite and non - zero matter density @xcite , by analysing their conformal viscous behavior as a function of the number of flavors .",
    "because of the perturbative nature of the theories investigated here , along the full energy range , our investigation of their viscous properties is also much better controlled than for qcd - like theories .",
    "this is so because at very high energies the theory is non - interacting and at very low energies the theory reaches an ir perturbative fixed point .",
    "furthermore , the value of the gauge coupling at the ir fixed point can be made arbitrarily small by changing the number of flavors and colors of the theory .",
    "this allows us to consistently truncate the perturbative expansion within the range of convergence of the theory .",
    "we henceforth determine the conformal behavior , as a function of the number of flavors , for the shear viscosity - to - entropy density ratio and the fermion - number diffusion coefficient . by adapting the results of ref .",
    "@xcite we learn that , as we decrease the number of flavors below the loss of asymptotic freedom , their ir fixed point values decrease .",
    "furthermore , for a given number of flavors within the perturbative conformal window both coefficients decrease with decreasing temperature ( once we multiply the diffusion coefficient by the temperature ) from their infinite value in the deep uv down to the value at the ir fixed point . we represent the results for three colors as a function of the number of flavors , but to the order investigated here the results are similar for any other fermion representation .",

    "it is natural to expect that , as we further decrease the number of flavors , the ir ratio further decreases to reach a minimum value at the lower boundary of the conformal window .",
