    "even though the spectrum of the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain was obtained by bethe@xcite almost seventy years ago using his famous ansatz , low - dimensional spin systems are still a strong area of activity , full of surprises and puzzles .",
    "a major source of this activity was haldane s conjecture,@xcite which predicted that isotropic antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains with integer spin have a gapped spectrum , while chains with half - integer spin have a gapless spectrum .",
    "there has been considerable theoretical and experimental evidence in support of haldane s conjecture ; it is probably appropriate to call it a theorem , despite the lack of a rigorous mathematical proof.@xcite incidentally , the gapped phase in integer spin heisenberg chains has come to be known as the haldane phase .    a breakthrough in understanding the nature of the haldane phase came when it was realized that one can go without a phase transition from the spin-1 heisenberg chain to the aklt model,@xcite where the ground state is made up solely of nearest neighbor valence bonds .",
    "the haldane gap is thus related to the energy needed to break short - ranged valence bonds .",
    "= 3.25 in    another important step was when den nijs and rommelse identified a hidden order in the haldane phase of the spin-1 chain.@xcite they showed that although the sites with @xmath0 are not well ordered in position , their sequence is ordered in the way shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : string ] .",
    "that is , if we remove all sites with @xmath1 , the remaining sites have nel order . the order parameter which reveals this hidden order is the non - local string order parameter @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spin-1 operator at site @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "a further impetus for the study of low - dimensional spin systems was given recently by the discovery of spin - ladder materials.@xcite since the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain has a gapless excitation spectrum with spin - spin correlation functions exhibiting power - law behavior , it initially came as a surprise when it was found that the two - leg ladder had a gapped spectrum with exponentially decaying spin - spin correlations,@xcite while the gapless spectrum survived in the three - leg ladder .",
    "thus ladders could have a gapped or gapless spectrum , depending on the number of legs . more specifically ,",
    "heisenberg ladders with an even number of legs have a gapped spectrum , while ladders with an odd number of legs have a gapless spectrum .",
    "the appearance of a gapped spectrum for even - legged ladders and a gapless spectrum for odd - legged ladders is highly reminiscent of haldane s conjecture for spin chains .",
    "therefore , a natural question arises : is the gapped phase in spin ladders related to the haldane phase in spin chains ?",
    "in particular , does the gapped phase exhibit string order ? for the rest of the paper , we will restrict our discussion to the two - leg ladder .    for the case of ferromagnetic interchain coupling ,",
    "it is clear that the two - leg ladder can be equivalent to the spin-1 chain , with the two spins on a rung forming an effective @xmath6 .",
    "such a phase is directly related to the haldane phase , and the system has string order .",
    "similarly , if the interchain coupling is antiferromagnetic and along plaquette diagonals , when the interchain coupling is equal to the coupling along the chains , the model is in fact the composite spin representation of the spin-1 chain ; thus , the gapped phase is equivalent to the haldane phase .",
    "( see sec .",
    "ii for a more detailed discussion of the composite spin representation . ) besides the gap , these models exhibit another characteristic feature of the haldane phase .",
    "namely , the ground state is unique if periodic boundary conditions are used , but it is four - fold degenerate for open boundary conditions .",
    "a gap appears in the excitation spectrum of spin ladders for other types of interchain coupling as well , namely for antiferromagnetic coupling along the rungs or ferromagnetic coupling along plaquette diagonals . whether these gapped phases are related to the haldane phase",
    "is much less obvious .",
    "for example , for antiferromagnetic interchain coupling along the rungs , the zeroth order picture is given by studying the limit in which the interchain coupling is much larger than the coupling along the chains ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) . in this limit",
    ", the ground state is well described by a product of rung singlets , with an energy gap @xmath8 to break a singlet and form a triplet excitation . here",
    ", the ground state is unique , irrespective of whether open or periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "nevertheless , as was demostrated by white,@xcite the antiferromagnetic ladder can be transformed continuously to a model ( seemingly ) equivalent to the composite spin representation of the spin-1 chain by switching on an irrelevant further neighbor coupling .",
    "consequently , the antiferromagnetic ladder is also related , in some way , to the haldane phase and has string order.@xcite    there are also other types of ladders exhibiting spin gapped phases , so the question of string order in ladders and the relationship of the gapped phases to the haldane phase becomes even more interesting . in particular , the spin-1/2 chain with second neighbor coupling is often represented as a two - leg zig - zag ladder.@xcite for a particular value of the couplings , the so - called majumdar - ghosh point,@xcite the ground state is known exactly",
    ". it is doubly degenerate and the excitation spectrum is gapped ; each ground state consists of a sequence of independent singlets .",
    "however , it was shown that the majumdar - ghosh ground state has perfect string order.@xcite it has also been shown@xcite that the majumdar - ghosh model can be smoothly connected to the ladder with strong ferromagnetic rung coupling , which is equivalent to a spin-1 chain , without a phase transition .",
    "since the ground state of the majumdar - ghosh model consists of decoupled singlets , similar to the ground state of the ladder with strong antiferromagnetic coupling along the rungs , one might get the impression that all spin - gapped phases can be smoothly connected to each other . by this we mean",
    "that one can go from one model to another by continuously varying the model parameters without undergoing a phase transition . in this paper , we show that the gapped phases in isotropic two - leg spin ladders divide into two topologically distinct classes .",
    "this implies that phase transitions must necessarily occur if we try to interpolate between models belonging to different topological classes .",
    "although not all gapped phases are directly equivalent to the haldane phase of the spin-1 chain , all possess some kind of string order .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the spin ladder models that we will consider , and we recapitulate briefly what is known about these models . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the relationship between valence bond states and string order , and also the possibility of phase transitions between spin models with topologically different string order .",
