    "the enhancement of heat transfer by embedded nano - particles in a fluid subjected to a temperature gradient is an important issue that is expected to help in technological application like solar heating , and various cooling devices , including miniaturized computer processors .",
    "accordingly , many experiments were conducted in the last couple of decades @xcite , with a breakthrough announcement from a group at argonne national laboratory , who studied water and oil - based nanofluids containing copper oxide nanopaticles , and found an amazing 60% enhancement in thermal conductivity for only a 5% volume fraction of nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "subsequent research has however generated what ref .",
    "@xcite referred to as `` an astonishing spectrum of results '' .",
    "results in the literature show sometime enhancement in the thermal conductivity compared to the prediction of the maxwell - garnett effective medium theory , and sometime values that are less than the same prediction @xcite .",
    "confusingly enough , these discrepancies occur even for the same fluid and the same size and composition of the nano - particles .",
    "some of these conflicting results were explained by either the formation of percolated clusters of particles ( for the case of enhancement with respect to the maxwell - garret prediction ) or by surface ( kapitza ) resistance ( for the case of reduction with respect to the same prediction ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , enhancement is typically seen in _ quiescent _ fluids , and one expects that the agglomeration of clusters will become impossible in flows , be them laminar or turbulent .",
    "of course , in technological application flowing nano - fluids may be the rule rather than the exception .",
    "thus our aim in this article is to develop models of heat flux in flowing nano - fluids , where the flow can be either laminar or turbulent . in such systems we can not expect an enhancement of heat flux due to the agglomeration of particles ( at least at low volume fractions ) , and for the sake of simplicity we will assume that there is no kapitza resistance . since it was reported in the literature that elongated nano - particles are superior to spheres in quiescent nanofluids @xcite",
    ", we will study both spheres and spheroids   in flowing nanofluids",
    ". we will argue that generically elongation may not be advantageous at all , and will explain why .    for completeness , we will begin by studying quiescent nanofluids under a temperature gradient",
    ". we will present extensive numerical simulation that will demonstrate a very good agreement with the maxwell - garnett theory for spherical nano - particles and with the generalization of nan et al @xcite for elongated particles . in the case of flowing nanofluid",
    "we will offer a model that will provide expressions for the heat transfer for different values of the aspect ratio of the particles , for different volume fractions and for laminar and turbulent flows .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section  ( [ s : model ] )",
    "we formulate the problem , describe the equations of motion and the numerical procedure , and discuss the dilute suspension approximation . in section  [ s:3body ]",
    "we describe the results of numerical simulations of spherical and spheroidal particles in a fluid at rest and in a shear flow . in section  [ s:4model ]",
    "we develop an analytical model of heat transfer characteristic , i.e. the nusselt number , and analyze the model predictions of heat flux enhancement in two limiting cases of very strong brownian diffusion and a weak one .",
    "in this section we formulate the model for dilute nanofluids laden with elongated spheroidal nanoparticles .",
    "this includes the basic equation of motion for the velocity and temperature fields and the boundary conditions ( with constant velocity and temperature gradients far away from particles ) .",
    "we also present details of the numerical simulations and their validation .      when the nanofluid is very dilute one can disregard the effect of one particle on the other and consider the nanofluid as an ensemble of noninteracting particles .",
    "one of these is shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "the center of the spheroidal particle is at the position @xmath0 in the middle of a plane couette flow between two @xmath1-separated horizontal parallel walls that move in the @xmath2-direction with opposite velocities @xmath3 . due to the symmetry ,",
    "the forces are balanced , and the particle neither migrates nor collides with the walls ; the particle s center remains at @xmath4 .",
    "this allows us to eliminate in the numerics any effect of the particle sweeping parallel to the walls .",
    "note that this effect is anyway absent in homogeneous cases .",
    "we employ periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 direction .",
    "this results in a periodic replication of the computational box ( together with the particle ) in the @xmath7-plane , leading to a `` monolayer '' of an infinite number of periodically distributed particles in the @xmath7-plane .",
    "remarkably enough ( and by reasons that will be explained below ) , this allows us to reproduce in numerics with a _",
    "single particle _ effects of _ a finite volume fraction _ @xmath8 at least up to @xmath9 .",
    "the walls are kept at fixed temperatures @xmath10 . in the absence of particles",
    "these boundary conditions give rise to a vertical temperature gradient @xmath11 and shear @xmath12 ( see fig .",

    "the carrier fluid has a kinematic viscosity @xmath17 and a thermal diffusivity @xmath18 .",
    "for simplicity , at this stage we neglect the effect of gravity and the particle mass .",
    "the co - ordinate system and polar angles are given by :    [ eq : anglesdefs ] @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the projection of the unit - vector @xmath21 onto the axis @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the angle between the particle s largest axis and the @xmath25-axis .     the particle in a plane couette flow . the largest particle axis is shown as a ( red ) rod . the velocity field ( far from the particle ) is @xmath26 where the shear @xmath27 in the particle - free flow with @xmath1 being the distance between the walls .",
    "for the theoretical development we assume the creeping flow conditions as in @xcite.,width=321 ]    in the absence of particles , changing the intensity of the laminar shear flow does not change the heat flux since there is no velocity orthogonal to the wall and the system is homogeneous in the direction parallel to the wall . in the presence of a particle , the shear induces it to rotate , the simplest case being a spherical particle which rotates at a constant angular velocity @xmath28 ( provided the particle radius is much smaller than the distance to the wall ) .",
    "this rotation induces a vertical flow motion near the particle .",
    "the modification of the velocity profile has three consequences .",
    "the first directly affects the heat convection in the fluid through a convective contribution @xmath29 .",
    "the second comes from the particle rotation which brings up the hotter side of the particle during its rotation .",
    "the third changes the heat conduction due to a modification of the temperature profiles at the surface of the particle .    in the case of non spherical particles the presence of a shear",
    "has also a strong influence of the statistical distribution of particle orientations .      to fix the notation we list here the most important dimensionless parameters involved in the problem :    [ dimnumdefs ] @xmath30    note that the particle s largest axis defines our length - scale",
    "also , @xmath31      the dynamical effects previously mentioned can be quantitatively studied by solving the following system of equations for the temperature in the fluid , @xmath32 , and in the particle , @xmath33 ,    [ basiceqs ] @xmath34 together with the boundary conditions , @xmath35    the fluid velocity in the whole domain can be found by solving the incompressible navier - stokes equations : @xmath36 together with non - slip boundary conditions at the surface of the particle and at the walls : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the carrier fluid density and @xmath39 is the pressure .",
    "clearly , on nano - scales the temperature difference ( across a particle ) is sufficiently small to allow us to neglect the dependence of the fluid s and particle s material parameters on the temperature , i.e. we take @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath16 as constants .",

    "we presented a study of the physics of the heat flux in a fluid laden with nanoparticles of different physical properties ( shape , thermal conductivity , etc ) .",
    "we developed a new analytical model for the effective thermal properties of dilute nanofluid suspensions .",
    "our model accounts for nanoparticle rotation dynamics including the fluid motion around the nanoparticles .",
    "we note that our model reproduces the classical maxwell - garnet model in the appropriate static limits .",
    "we used a combination of theoretical models and numerical experiments in order to make progress from the simplest case of spherical nanoparticles in a quiescent fluid to the most general case of rotating spheroidal particles in shear flows .",
    "the new physical ingredient that we consider is the exact dynamics of particles in shear flows .",
    "this constitute a novelty as most of the models introduced so far , to explain the thermal properties of thermal colloids , have focused only on the static properties of the nanoparticle suspension .",
    "our model starts from the realization that particles ( spherical or spheroidal ) in the presence of a gradient of the velocity field are induced to rotate .",
    "the dynamics of rotation is absolutely non trivial , but it has been studied at length with correspondece ( for the case of a laminar and stationary shear flow ) to the jeffery orbits .",
    "the particles rotation dynamics has a double influence on the thermal properties of the nanofluid .",
    "first , particles rotation induces fluid motions in the proximity of the particles , this in turn can enhance the thermal fluxes by means of advective motions along the direction of the temperature gradient .",
    "second , the jeffery dynamics of particles leads to a statistical distribution of particles orientation that depends on a multitude of parameters , e.g. the particle aspect ratio , the shear intensity as well as on the intensity of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the statistical distribution of particle orientation has a dramatic influence on the heat flux : an elongated particle oriented along the temperature gradient increases the thermal flux , while a particle with perpendicular orientation reduces it .",
    "the statistical orientation of particles can thus produce a mixed effects with a non - trivial dependence on the particle aspect ratio .",
    "more elongated particles can enhance the heat flux because of the stronger contribution when properly aligned to the temperature gradient but , because of shear , more elongated particles are also spending more time in the unfavorable direction ( i.e. perpendicular to the temperature flux ) thus reducing the thermal conductivity of the fluid .    by means of numerical approximations we are able to provide closed expressions for the effective conductivity of the fluid under several flow regimes and for several physical parameters",
    "our model considerably extends classical models for nanofluid heat transfer , like e.g. the one of maxwell - garnet , and may help to rationalize some of the recent experimental findings . in particular , we suggest that experiments should consider more carefully measurements performed in quiescent and under flowing conditions : the particles dynamics may lead to very different thermal properties in the two cases .    finally , the next steps toward a robust predictive models for the heat transfer in nanofluids should include the effect of surface ( kapitza ) resistance and the effect of nanoparticle aggregation .",
    "further it would also be extremely important to extend the model to the case of heat flux in turbulent nanofluids as this case is very relevant to many applications . in the presence of turbulence a particular attention",
    "should also be paid to the effect on the drag induced by the presence of spherical , rod - like or maybe even deformable nanoparticle inclusions .",
