    "significant observational resources are currently being devoted to surveys of our galaxy from both the ground ( apogee , lamost , gaia - eso , galah ) and space ( gaia ) .",
    "much of this effort centres on determining the chemical compositions of stars in addition to their phase - space locations .",
    "a star carries its chemistry throughout its life , so we may hope to infer from it the time and place of its birth . in particular , chemistry is the only indicator of radial migration , a process that has attracted much attention since @xcite showed that it is the dominant effect of spiral structure and @xcite argued that it explains the structure of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "it is much harder to determine the chemical composition of a star than to measure its position and velocity , so the density of stars in phase space has been extensively studied in the absence of chemical data . to a good first approximation our galaxy should be in dynamical equilibrium , so by jeans theorem",
    "the phase - space density of stars , @xmath1 , should depend on the phase - space coordinates @xmath2 only through constants of stellar motion .",
    "there are many reasons to prefer action integrals @xmath3 @xmath4 ) over other constants of motion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the natural first step in the interpretation of a galaxy survey is to relate the data to a distribution function ( ) of the form @xmath5 .",
    "* hereafter b12 ) showed that models in which @xmath5 is an analytic function are remarkably successful in reproducing data from the geneva  copenhagen survey ( hereafter gcs ) @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite showed that a  @xmath5 that had been fitted to the gcs predicts the kinematics of stars in the radial velocity experiment ( rave , * ? ? ? * ) with remarkable success .",
    "recently @xcite obtained the tightest constraints yet on the galaxy s dark - matter distribution by fitting rave data with s of the form introduced by @xcite under the assumption of a variety of trial galactic potentials @xmath6 .    in the work of b12 and @xcite ,",
    "the implicit assumption was that the probability of a star being included in a survey is independent of its age or metallicity , and varies only with location .",
    "this assumption is false , because at a given distance the probability that a star will be included in a survey declines with decreasing luminosity to zero below a threshold luminosity .",
    "since luminosity depends on age , metallicity and mass , the fraction of any coeval cohort of stars at a given location that will be included in a survey varies with the cohort s age and metallicity .",
    "moreover , the kinematics of any coeval cohort will depend on its age because stars are born on nearly circular orbits and drift over time onto more inclined and eccentric orbits .",
    "consequently , one can predict the kinematics of the stars at some location @xmath7 that are included in a given survey , as distinct from the kinematics of all the stars at @xmath7 , only if one takes into account the dependence of luminosity on age and metallicity .",
    "the s introduced by b12 include age as an internal parameter , but make no reference to metallicity . if we are to engage with the luminosities of stars through isochrones , we must recognise that every chemically distinguishable population of stars has its own",
    ". we could proceed by seeking a @xmath8 for each discrete bin , labelled by @xmath9 , in chemistry space .",
    "alternatively , we could make the distribution function a continuous function of chemistry by writing @xmath10 .",
    "here we do the latter and call the function @xmath10 an _ extended distribution function _",
    "hoping to emulate the success that analytic s have had , in this paper we introduce an analytic form for the galaxy s .",
    "the discrete approach was advocated by @xcite , who argued that sub - populations of segue g dwarfs defined by cells in @xmath11 space have simple spatial and kinematic structures .",
    "this discrete approach relieves one of the necessity of picking a functional form for the  that is consistent with the actual density of stars in data space .",
    "however , discretisation has three drawbacks .",
    "first , choosing bin sizes always requires a compromise between losing the information contained in the position of each datum within its bin and increasing poisson noise by making the bins small .",
    "second , since the distribution of stars in chemical space is established by a large number of enrichment events , we have reason to believe it smooth .",
    "if we permit the data - fitting routine to choose a discontinuous distribution , we run the risk of masking astrophysically important signals in the data .",
    "third , we require errors in the @xmath11 space that are much smaller than the bin sizes , otherwise we are neglecting the possibility of contamination on each bin by neighbouring bins . additionally , a continuous parametrization allows for a rigorous treatment of the error distributions in @xmath11 and how these errors correlate with the kinematic errors .",
    "hence we believe that it is best to work with an  provided we are confident that we have a sufficiently flexible and well - tailored functional form .",
    "a very useful working hypothesis is that all disc stars were born near the plane from an interstellar medium ( ism ) that has only a radial abundance gradient . with this hypothesis chemical composition",
    "provides a clue to the radius and time of a star s formation , because the chemical composition of the ism has evolved over the life of the galaxy from very @xmath12-rich and metal - poor to solar - type @xmath12 abundances and metal - rich , with the evolution being expected to be fastest and most effective at small radii . hence the chemical distribution of stars at any location @xmath7 is intrinsically interesting , and by upgrading a model s  to an  we gain the ability to predict measured chemical distributions .    in section  [ edf ] , we introduce the functional form of our s. in section  [ sec::data ] , we discuss the data that will be relevant for our experiments with s. in section  [ selfns ] , we discuss selection functions and how one can model the kinematics of a data set without explicitly modelling the selection function . in section  [ paramchoice ] , we go on to fit the parameters of our extended distribution function to the gcs data . in section  [ sec::results ] , we construct mock catalogues for the gcs and segue g dwarfs from the extended distribution functions .",
    "section  [ sec : conclude ] sums up and looks to the future .",
    "in principle , an is the joint distribution function of the phase - space coordinates @xmath13 , and any additional properties of each star , such as @xmath14 . here",
    "we extend the usual to include just metallicity @xmath15  for simplicity we assume zero @xmath12-enhancement for the stars , so @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be used interchangeably .",
    "we start from the introduced by b12 and take inspiration from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sb09 ) , who model in full the joint chemical and dynamical evolution of the galactic disc under the conventional assumption that at a given radius @xmath17 and age @xmath18 the interstellar medium ( ism ) has a well - defined metallicity @xmath19 .",
    "chemical evolution models based on this assumption have a long history @xcite but the importance of radial mixing for these models has only been realised in recent years beginning with the sb09 models .    in the following subsections",
    "we develop our modelling approach culminating in the specified by equation  .",
    "the usefulness of this  in no way depends on the correctness of the arguments we use below to motivate its construction .",
    "hence busy readers may skip forwards to equation   and on to section  [ sec::data ] , and thus bypass our account of the chain of reasoning that leads us to propose equation  .",
    "in this section we specify a functional form for the metallicity of the ism @xmath19 .",
    "6 of sb09 shows the evolution of @xmath16 in the ism at a grid of radii .",
    "the models of sb09 include full chemical evolution as well as gas accretion and flows .",
    "however , despite the complexity of the input model , the resulting form for the ism metallicity as a function of radius and time is remarkably simple .",
    "we find that this evolution can be quite well fitted by the functional form @xmath20\\tanh\\big(\\frac{\\tau_m-\\tau}{\\tau_f}\\big)+f_m , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , the age and the metallicity of the oldest stars .",

    "our model captures the essential features of the data although with varying degrees of success .",
    "the peaks of the data distributions are replicated by the model . at low @xmath117",

    ", our model produces a small peak at @xmath130 which is the centre of the gaussian used to model the halo metallicity distribution .",
    "the data is unimodal and steadily declines towards low metallicity .",
    "@xmath131{segue_plots / segue_metalgrads_withjz.pdf}\\ ] ]      our model has performed surprisingly well in predicting the segue g dwarf data considering we have not adjusted the potential . here",
    "we discuss some attempts made to improve the segue predictions .",
    "the most obvious discrepancy between model and data is the over - abundance of metal - rich ( @xmath121 ) stars in the model .",
    "we wish to decrease the impact of the thin disc at intermediate galactic heights whilst retaining a dominant thin disc population in the gcs sample .",
    "we tried decreasing @xmath132 by setting @xmath133 and simultaneously decreasing @xmath134 such that the younger populations remained at fixed velocity dispersion whilst the older populations were made cooler and so less dominant with height . however , this did little to reduce the number of metal - rich stars in the segue g dwarf sample . additionally , we tried increasing @xmath135 to @xmath136 such that the relative number of hot metal - rich thin disc stars from the inner galaxy was reduced .",
    "again , this did little to remedy the situation . finally , we tried evaluating the velocity dispersions at the radius of a circular orbit with angular momentum @xmath137 as this location better reflects the disc environment that heats the given star .",
    "this would cause the contribution of the thin disc to die off faster with galactic height as velocity dispersion falls with radius .",
    "however , as the scale - lengths of the velocity dispersions are long in our model this small adjustment does not significantly change the predictions .",
    "another deficiency of the model is the inability to match the trend of @xmath16 with @xmath44 and the model does not produce the positive gradients of @xmath129 seen in fig .",
    "[ segue_metalgrads_jz ] . in order to improve the situation we tried breaking the assumption that the thick disc is a single quasi - isothermal and made the scale - length a linear function of age from @xmath138 at the birth of the galaxy to @xmath139 at @xmath140 .",
    "this model assumes the galaxy formed inside - out .",
    "this did not improve the run of @xmath44 with @xmath16 and actually produced more metal - rich thick disc stars in the sample , and thus shifted the model metallicity distribution to higher @xmath16 .",
    "one problem is that the strong radial migration broadens the thick disc so the kinematic signal of inside - out formation is washed out and we are left with the chemical signature : a higher abundance of metal - rich stars .",
    "we have presented a simple extension of the action - based distribution functions of b12 to include metallicity information .",
    "our model is the first continuous chemo - dynamical model in the literature and is constructed such that the spatial and kinematic distributions are consistent with a realistic galactic potential .",
    "inspired by the full chemo - dynamical evolution models of sb09 , we included analytically the relationship between metallicity and dynamics .",
    "the model explicitly includes a simple , but novel , radial migration prescription that causes the solar metallicity distribution to broaden as stars migrate to @xmath141 from the inner and outer disc . despite the simplicity of our radial migration prescription",
    "we have shown that it preserves the radial profile of the disc and hence the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "all surveys have a selection function that restricts apparent magnitude .",
    "the luminosity of a star depends on its initial mass , its metallicity and its age according to the appropriate isochrone . by selecting on apparent magnitude",
    ", we select on a combination of mass , age and metallicity , and we need an  to model this selection , as we must before we can properly compare a model to data .    we showed that selecting solar - neighbourhood stars on apparent magnitude alone , implies a strong selection on age . because young stars have smaller random velocities than old stars , by preferentially selecting young stars , an apparent - magnitude cut returns a sample with a materially smaller velocity dispersion than that of the underlying population .",
    "this effect , which makes the gcs stars younger than the local population , has been neglected in recent studies that employed a , such as b12 and @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the requirement to use an  rather than a  is an opportunity as well as a necessity .",
    "the opportunity has two parts .",
    "first , an  should to lead to tighter constraints on the galactic potential because each observationally distinguishable chemical population has its own dynamics yet must be consistent with the same galactic potential .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated the value of this principle in the context of two populations within dwarf spheroidal galaxies , but our galaxy , with its rich array of populations , offers more exciting possibilities . similarly , @xcite combined constraints on the galactic potential obtained by modelling independently the dynamics of 43 chemically distinct samples of segue g dwarfs .",
    "the need to work with s is also an opportunity in relation to galactic archaeology .",
    "chemistry indicates where a star was born , which , when combined with its current kinematics , provides information about the history of the star and the galaxy .",
    "we fitted the parameters of our  to the gcs and the @xcite stellar density curve under the assumption of an arbitrary , but quite realistic galactic potential .",
    "the parameters of the fitted  suggest that stars migrate widely in radius in the course of even @xmath142 . with the  we sampled a mock gcs catalogue and",
    "compared that to the data .",
    "the model provided a good fit to the gcs data although it is axisymmetric and as such unable to reproduce the rich velocity - space substructure of the gcs .",
    "we demonstrated the importance of the selection function when modelling the gcs , which suppresses the number of old , metal - poor stars such that the thick disc s contribution to the dataset is less than its true contribution to the solar neighbourhood .",
    "additionally , we recover the observed spatial and kinematic metallicity gradients in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the quality of the fits we obtain to the gcs data is very encouraging for it shows that the adopted functional form for the  is sufficiently flexible to capture the chemo - dynamics of the immediate solar neighbourhood while reproducing the star - count data of @xcite .",
    "this is a non - trivial feat and one that could not be accomplished even using a functional form for the  that encompassed the truth if we had adopted a galactic potential that was seriously in error .",
    "a natural next step would have been to fit the  to the data set formed by the gcs and segue survey taken together .",
    "however , we did not pursue this course , but chose instead to use the  fitted to the gcs alone to _",
    "predict _ the segue data .",
    "this was a bold step to take because the thick disc and halo , which dominate the segue data , do not contribute much to the gcs , so the predictions are determined by the noisy tails of the gcs data .",
    "moreover , the segue stars are located far from the plane , so the predictions are sensitive to the structure of the adopted galactic potential , and it is not clear that the metallicity scales of the gcs and segue coincide .",
    "it follows that even moderate agreement between the predictions and the segue data must be counted strong endorsement of our functional form for the because noise in the gcs , errors in the potential and discrepant metallicity scales will all ensure that perfect predictions were not obtained even with the functional form that encompassed the truth .",
    "the  fitted to the gcs predicts the velocity distributions of the data with considerable success , the main shortcoming being a distribution in @xmath44 that is shifted by @xmath143 to lower @xmath44 with respect to the segue data .",
    "its prediction of the metallicity distribution is less successful because the predicted abundance of stars with @xmath0 is too low and the predicted abundance of stars with @xmath144 is too high",
    ". the fault may not lie with the model ",
    "@xcite argue that there is a bias in the segue stellar parameter pipeline that causes an artificial build - up of stars at @xmath145 . nonetheless , it is possible that our model of the thick disc is too simple , so we tried a number of small fixes to improve the segue predictions .",
    "these experiments indicated that with our adopted potential it is difficult to have a large number of metal - rich stars in the gcs sample and very few in the segue sample .",
    "hence we tentatively conclude that the fault lies more with the segue data than our model .",
    "although our thick disc has an extended ( @xmath146 ) period of formation , during which its chemistry evolved rapidly , we have retained b12 s assumption that the thick disc is a single quasi - isothermal .",
    "no physical principle underlays this assumption , it was just the simplest assumption to make about a component of the galaxy that did not contribute largely to the gcs and about which rather little was known .",
    "if we are to retain the thick disc , our model of it should probably be more elaborate .    before hastening to develop an elaborate model of the thick disc , we should re - examine the case for the very existence of the thick disc .",
    "our model includes a distinct thick disc as we require a distinct population with a high vertical velocity dispersion to match the @xcite data at large galactic heights .",
    "however , although we have included it as a distinct population in our model , the thick disc does not stand out in the segue g dwarf mock sample .",
    "@xcite argued from the same sample in a different way that there is no evidence of the expected thin / thick dichotomy , and concluded that our galaxy s disc extends seamlessly from an old , @xmath12-rich wing to a young @xmath12-poor wing .",
    "if the thick disc can be defined in an intellectually satisfying way , it must be defined through chemistry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and strong believers in the thin / disc dichotomy argue that the distribution of stars in the @xmath11 plane is bimodal @xcite , while @xcite argue that this bimodality is a selection effect .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite have shown that the apogee data points to the existence of a bimodality in the @xmath11 plane . in our view",
    "this remains an open question , and one that is best resolved by combining s with ongoing surveys such as the gaia - eso .",
    "if we are to have a distinct thick disc , section  [ sec : mockgdwarf ] makes it clear that there must be correlations between the chemistry and kinematics of stars .",
    "the failures of our  arise because it restricts these correlations to the thin disc .",
    "the observed increase of guiding - centre radius with metallicity , even at high @xmath117 , suggests that the oldest , most metal - poor stars formed only at small radii and reach us only at the apocentres of eccentric orbits .",
    "we could provide for an effect along these lines by making the thick disc , like the thin disc , a superposition of coeval quasi - isothermals with velocity - dispersion parameters that increase with age .",
    "success of this modification in reproducing the segue data might reasonably be interpreted as strong support for the contention that the thin / thick dichotomy is artificial .    if the modification just suggested were not entirely successful , two departures from the assumptions of sb09 that are implicit in our  might be required to restrict metal - poor star formation to the inner galaxy : ( i ) an increase over time in the scale length @xmath147 of the star - formation rate , and ( ii ) a vigorous outward flow of metals to restrict the production of very metal - poor stars with high angular momentum .",
    "the sb09 model does provide for metals to pass into virial - temperature gas that can flow outwards , but the dominant metal flow is within the disc and directed inward .",
    "our should be extended to include the @xmath148 abundances .",
    "@xmath148 is an invaluable surrogate for the age of a star , and the @xmath149 plane is widely used to disentangle different galactic populations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* sb09 ) .",
    "valuable next steps in  modelling would be    1 .   a simultaneous fit of the  to the gcs and segue data sets in a given galactic potential .",
    "2 .   a simultaneous fit of the  and the galactic potential to the gcs and segue data sets .",
    "fits of the  to the rave @xcite and gaia - eso @xcite data .",
    "both surveys provide @xmath150 stars at intermediate distances from the galactic plane , so nicely complement the thin - disc - dominated view from the gcs and the thick - disc dominated view from the segue survey . @xcite",
    "have shown that the s provide a good account of the rave data , whilst @xcite used the rave stars to constrain the galactic potential .",
    "these analyses essentially assumed the selection function of the rave survey is uniform in age , and they did not use the metallicity information .",
    "the should be used to repeat this analysis to constrain simultaneously the galactic potential and uncover signatures of evolutionary processes in the galaxy , such as radial migration .",
    "the gaia - eso survey provides higher - resolution spectra and more accurate metallicities than rave , and can see fainter stars .",
    "the constraints from these two surveys should be highly complementary .",
    "our  is inspired by one particular model of the galaxy s chemo - dynamical evolution .",
    "it would be interesting to see how well it fits other chemo - dynamical models , and potentially to modify the functional form to produce one that provides good fits to several different models .",
    "the parameter values required to fit each model would then serve to place the models in a well defined space .",
    "fits to observational data would allow us to locate our galaxy in this space .      in the coming years",
    ", galaxy models will inevitably be important for scientific exploitation of galaxy surveys because by far the best way to allow for the huge impact of selection effects on any galaxy survey is to `` observe '' a model with realistic selection biases .",
    "moreover , a model enables us to make proper allowance for the impact of measurement errors on data .",
    "models of three very different types will play roles .",
    "there are @xmath151-body simulations of galaxy formation and chemical evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , models of chemo - dynamical evolution that follow star formation and chemical enrichment in a gas disc that is decomposed into chemically homogeneous annuli @xcite , and there are models with analytic s. additionally , there are the hybrid models of @xcite that sit between the first two types of models mentioned in that they combine @xmath151-body simulations of the dynamics with a annulus - based chemical - evolution model .",
    "the goal of an  model is more modest than the goals of the other models in that it seeks to describe how the galaxy is configured at the present time , without predicting how it arrived at this state .",
    "so it is _ descriptive _ rather than _",
    "explanatory_. from this modesty we gain tractability in the sense that an  model can be most easily adjusted to fit it to observational data",
    ". then the model encapsulates in an intuitive way what the data have to say about how the galaxy is currently structured .",
    "in fact , we believe  models will provide a valuable interface between observational data and cosmological simulations : an  fitted to the endpoint of a simulation will provide a summary of the content of that simulation , and comparison of this  with one fitted to the observational data will indicate in what respects the simulation is more and less successful .    our models are designed to describe the present state of the galaxy , which must be pinned down in advance of fruitful speculation as to what evolutionary processes set it up .",
    "our adopted functional form of the  is , however , inspired by a particular model of the galaxy s historical development .",
    "it is tempting , therefore , to interpret the best - fitting parameters of the  as revealing something about our galaxy s history .",
    "we caution against over - interpretation of the models  they are descriptive in nature , and designed to encapsulate our galaxy s current structure .",
