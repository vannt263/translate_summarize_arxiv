    "boundary value problems on the unit sphere arise naturally in geophysics and oceanography when scientists model a physical quantity on large scales .",
    "in that situation , the curvature of the earth can not be ignored , and a boundary value problem has to be formulated on a subdomain of the unit sphere .",
    "for example , the study of planetary - scale oceanographic flows in which oceanic eddies interact with topography such as ridges and land masses or evolve in closed basin lead to the study of point vortices on the surface of the sphere with walls @xcite .",

    "was proposed by crowdy in @xcite .",
    "kidambi and newton @xcite also considered such a problem , assuming the sub - surface of the sphere lent itself to method of images .",
    "a boundary integral method for constructing numerical solutions to the problem was discussed in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a collocation method using spherical radial basis functions .",
    "radial basis functions ( rbfs ) present a simple and effective way to construct approximate solutions to partial differential equations ( pdes ) on spheres , via a collocation method @xcite or a galerkin method @xcite .",
    "they have been used successfully for solving transport - like equations on the sphere @xcite .",
    "the method does not require a mesh , and is simple to implement .",
    "while meshless methods using rbfs have been employed to derive numerical solutions for pdes on the sphere only recently , it should be mentioned that approximation methods using rbfs for pdes on bounded domains have been around for the last two decades .",
    "originally proposed by kansa @xcite for fluid dynamics , approximation methods for many types of pdes defined on bounded domains in @xmath0 using rbfs have since been used widely @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "approximation methods using rbfs have not been investigated for boundary value problems defined on subdomains of the unit sphere . given the potential of rbf methods on these problems , the present paper aims to present a collocation method for boundary value problems on the sphere and provide a mathematical foundation for error estimates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ prelim ] we review some preliminaries on functions spaces , positive definite kernels , radial basis functions and the generalized interpolation problem on discrete point sets on the unit sphere . in section  [ bvp - section ]",
