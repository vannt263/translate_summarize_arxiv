    "in the majority of cases plasma contains a great deal of electrically charged particles .",
    "free electrons in metals can be treated as a degenerate plasma .",
    "if the motion of charged particles in plasma is organized , one can expect the existence of macroscopic quantum effects .",
    "for instance , collective oscillations of the crystal lattice ions can be exited in metals .",
    "these oscillations are interpreted as quasi - particles or phonons .",
    "phonons are known to be bosons .",
    "the exchange of a phonon causes the effective attraction between two free electrons in plasma of metals .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the formation of a cooper pair  @xcite and is important in the explanation of the superconductivity of metals .",
    "cooper pairs can exist during a macroscopic time resulting in an undamped electric current .",
    "unfortunately the formation of cooper pairs is possible only at very low temperatures .",
    "nowadays there are a great deal of attempts to obtain a superconducting material at high temperatures  @xcite .    without an external field ,",
    "e.g. a magnetic field , the motion of electrons in plasma is stochastic .",
    "it results in rather short times of plasma recombination .",
    "the laboratory plasma at atmospheric pressure without an energy supply recombines during @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "that is why free oscillations of electrons in plasma , i.e. without any external source of energy , will attenuate rather fast .",
    "therefore to form a cooper pair in plasma one should create a highly structured electrons motion to overcome the thermal fluctuations of background charged particles .",
    "nevertheless it is known that a plasmon superconductivity can appear  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied quantum oscillations of electron gas in plasma on the basis of the solutions to the non - linear schrdinger equation .",
    "the spherically and axially symmetrical solutions to the schrdinger equation were found in our works .",
    "we revealed that the densities of both electrons and positively charged ions have a tendency to increase in the geometrical center of the system .",
    "the found solutions belong to two types , low and high energy ones , depending on the branch in the dispersion relation ( see also sec .  [ model ] ) .",
    "we put forward a hypothesis that a microdose nuclear fusion reactions can happen inside a high energy oscillating electron gas .",
    "this kind of reaction can provide the energy supply to feed the system .",
    "in our works we suggested that the obtained solutions can serve as a model of a high energy ball lightning .",

    "it is the main difficulty in constructing of long - lived plasma structures . in a high energy solution",
    "internal nuclear fusion reactions could compensate the energy losses .",
    "we suggest that the mechanism , which prevents the decay of low energy oscillations of the electron gas , is based on the possible existence of the plasma superconductivity . in frames of our model",
    "we show that the interaction of two electrons , described by spherical waves , can be mediated by a virtual plasmon . for plasmon frequencies corresponding to the microwave range , this interaction results in the additional negative energy",
    ". then it is found that for a low energy solution with the specific characteristic this negative energy results in the effective attraction .",
    "therefore a cooper pair of two electrons can be formed because the interacting electrons should have oppositely directed spins . using this result it is possible to state that the friction occurring when electrons propagate through the background matter can be significantly reduced due to the superconductivity phenomenon .",

    "[ concl ] we summarize and discuss the obtained results .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we discussed the motion of an electron with the mass @xmath1 and the electric charge @xmath2 interacting with both background electrons and positively charged ions .",
    "the evolution of this system is described by the non - linear schrdinger equation , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the term which is responsible for the interaction of an electron with background matter which includes electrons and positively charged ions with the number density @xmath5 . in eq .",
    "the wave function is normalized on the number density of electrons , @xmath6 .",

    "the @xmath7-number wave function @xmath8 depends on the coordinates of a single electron . generally in a many - body system",
    "this kind of approximation is valid for an operator wave function , i.e. when it is expressed in terms of creation or annihilation operators . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that it is possible to rewrite an exact operator schrdinger equation using @xmath7-number wave functions for a single particle .",

    ". however since we look for the solution in the pertubative form   and linearize these equations , the solution to eqs .   and   describe the interactions of the considered electron only with background electrons , which correspond to the coordinate independent wave function @xmath22 , rather than with electrons which participate in spherically symmetrical oscillations .",
    "in this section we discuss the interaction between two electrons participating in spherically symmetrical oscillations .",
    "this interaction is supposed to be mediated by a plasmon field @xmath23 . to account for the electron interaction with a plasmon one has to include the additional term @xmath24 into the hamiltonian @xmath25 in eq .  .",
    "we also admit that electron gas oscillations correspond to the lower branch @xmath26 in the dispersion relation  , i.e. we are interested in the dynamics of a low energy solution .",
    "a plasmon field distribution can be obtained directly from the maxwell equation for the electric displacement field @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the free charge density of electrons . as it was mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite the vector potential for spherically symmetrical oscillations can be put to zero @xmath30 . therefore only longitudinal plasmons can exist . presenting the potential @xmath23 in the form of the fourier integral , @xmath31 we get the formal solution to eq .   as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the green function for the longitudinal plasmon . in eq .",
    "@xmath34 stands for the longitudinal permittivity .",
    "note that to choose the exact form of the green function   one has to specify passing - by a residue at @xmath35 .",
    "we will regularize the green function by putting a cut - off at small momenta .",
    "it should be noticed that the more rigorous derivation of the plasmon green function is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to relate eq .   with the distribution of electrons we can take that free charge density is proportional to the probability distribution , @xmath36 .",
    "then , using eq .   and the schrdinger equation   with the new hamiltonian @xmath37 we obtain the closed non - linear equation for the the electron wave function only .",
    "now we write down the new hamiltonian explicitly , @xmath38 as we mentioned in sec .  [ model ]",

    "it is possible to introduce the additional energy acquired in scattering of two electrons as @xmath40 in eq .",
    "we add one additional integration over @xmath41 which is convenient for further calculations . to take into account",

    "@xcite ) . taking into account that the frequencies and the coefficients @xmath13 are even functions of @xmath15",

    "one can make it in a standard way , @xmath58 , and then divide the whole expression on the observation time . since the energy is concerned in the scattering one has two possibilities for the momenta , @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",

    "@xcite the typical frequencies of electron gas oscillations in our problem @xmath65 , which is @xmath66 .",
    "such frequencies lie deep inside the microwave region .",
    "the permittivity of plasma for this kind of situation has the following form ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the transport collision frequency . in eq .",
    "we neglect the spatial dispersion .",
    "it is clear that in eq .",
    "one has to study the static limit , i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "supposing that the density of electrons is relatively high , i.e. @xmath70 , one gets that the permittivity of plasma becomes negative and the interaction of two electrons results in the effective attraction .    note that at the absence of spatial dispersion the integral is divergent on the lower limit .",
    "such a divergence is analogous to the infrared divergence in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "we have to regularize it by the substitution @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the debye length and @xmath73 is the plasma temperature .    besides the energy @xmath62 , which is acquired in a collision , an electron also has its kinetic energy and the energy of the interaction with background charged particles .",
    "for the effective attraction to take place we should compare the additional negative energy with the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath25 , which includes both kinetic term and interaction with other electrons and ions .",
    "we suggest that two electrons , which are involved in the scattering , move towards each other , i.e. @xmath74 . therefore",

    "one obtains the following inequality to be satisfied for the attraction to happen : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the thermal velocity of background electrons in plasma and @xmath78 is the boltzmann constant . in eq .",
    "we use the variables @xmath21 and @xmath79 which were introduced in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "we also assume that @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the density in the central region [ see eq .  ] . as it was predicted in our work  @xcite , @xmath81 should have bigger values that the density on the rim of the system .",
    "we can also introduce two dimensionless parameters , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , to relate the density in the center , the density of free electrons , and the rim density : @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath86 .",
    "it is known ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the number density of free electrons in a spark discharge is equal to @xmath87 .",
    "approximately the same electrons number densities are acquired in a streak lightning .",
    "if one takes the rim density equal to the loschmidt constant @xmath88 , we arrive to the maximal value of @xmath86 . in this case",
    "mainly the collisions with neutral atoms would contribute to the transport collision frequency .",
    "one can approximate this quantity as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the characteristic collision cross section and @xmath91 is the typical atomic radius .",
    "note that the process in question happens in the center of the system .",
    "that is why we take the central number density @xmath81 in the expression for @xmath68 .",
    "finally we receive the following inequality to be satisfied for the effective attraction between two electrons to take place : @xmath92 where @xmath93 . in eq .",
    "we take the reference temperature @xmath94 .",
    "now one calculates other reference quantities like @xmath95 and @xmath96 as @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    as one can see on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] [ see also eq .  ]",
    "the parameter @xmath79 is always more than @xmath51 for the upper branch .",
    "it means that the inequality in eq .   can never be satisfied . on the contrary",
    ", there is a possibility to implement the condition   for the lower branch on fig .",
    "it signifies the existence of the effective attraction between electrons .    on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the allowed regions where the effective attraction happens .     the allowed regions in the @xmath99 plane for the existence of the effective attraction between two electrons performing quantum oscillations corresponding to the lower branch on fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we also add one more vertical axis on the right hand side demonstrating the behaviour of the quantum number @xmath15 .",

    "this plot was created for the constant value of @xmath103 .",
    "we analyze the condition   numerically .",
    "the calculation is terminated when we reach the point @xmath104 .",
    "it has the physical sense since oscillations can not exist for @xmath105 according to eq .",
    "( see also fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "one can notice that always there is a critical value of the central density .",
    "it is equal to @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 for the temperatures @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively .",
    "it means that in the center of the system there is an additional pressure of about @xmath109 .",
    "one has to verify the validity of the used approach checking that @xmath110 in eq .  .",
    "it would signify that that the the quantum number @xmath15 is more than @xmath111 .",
    "the values of @xmath112 are @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively . comparing these values with the curves on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] one can see that the condition @xmath110 is always satisfied for all the allowed zone of the effective attraction existence .",
    "for the effective attraction to happen one should have the negative values of @xmath116 in eq .  .",
    "using eq .",
    "one can conclude that the following inequality should be satisfied : @xmath117 or equivalently @xmath118 .",
    "for @xmath103 and temperatures @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 we get the critical values of @xmath82 as @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively .",
    "one sees on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that all the curves lie far below the critical values of @xmath82 .",
    "therefore the condition @xmath122 is always satisfied .",
    "in conclusion we mention that we studied spherically symmetrical quantum oscillations of electron gas in plasma which correspond to a low energy solution to the schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "we suggested that two independent plasma excitations , corresponding to two separate electrons , can interact via exchange of a plasmon .",
    "since the typical oscillations frequencies are very high and lie in the deep microwave region the plasma permittivity is negative and the interaction of two electrons result in the appearance of an attraction . for the this attraction to be actual we compared it with the kinetic energy of electrons and the energy of interaction of electrons with other background charged particles .",
    "the total energy of an electrons pair turned out to be negative for the lower branch in the dispersion relation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . although we did not demonstrate it explicitly , using the same technique as in sec .",
    "[ le ] one can check that the total energy of electrons is always positive for the upper branch .",
    "it means that even additional negative energy does not cause the attraction of electrons .",
    "it is interesting to mention that to obtain the master equations   and   in ref .",
    "@xcite we neglected the exchange effects between an electron which corresponds to the wave function @xmath47 and the rest of background electrons ( see also ref .",
    "this crude approximation is valid if the superconductivity takes place because in this case the friction , i.e. the interaction , between oscillating and background electrons is negligible .",
    "the proposed plasmon superconductivity happening at spherically symmetrical oscillations of electrons could be implemented in a low energy ball lightning .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies of ball lightnings have many years history ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this natural phenomenon , happening mainly during a thunderstorm , is very rare and we do not have so many its reliable witnesses . there were numerous attempts to generate in a laboratory stable structures similar to a ball lightning .",
    "many theoretical models aiming to describe the observational data were put forward . in putting forward a ball lightning model",
    "one should try to explain these properties on the basis of the existing physical ideas without involvement of extraordinary concepts ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) though they look very exciting .",
    "however none of the available models could explain all the specific properties of a fireball .    among the existing ball lightning models one can mention the aerogel model  @xcite .",
    "according to this model fractal fibers of the aerogel can form a knot representing the skeleton of a ball lightning . using this model",
    "it is possible to explain some of the ball lightning features .",
    "the interesting model of a ball lightning having complex onion - like structure with multiple different layers was put forward in ref .",
    "however in this model an external source of electrical energy is necessary for a ball lightning to exist for a long time .",
    "the hypothesis that a ball lightning is composed of molecular clusters was described in ref .",
    "this model can explain the existence of a low energy ball lightning . in ref .",
    "@xcite the sophisticated ball lightning model was proposed , which is based on the non - trivial magnetic field configuration in the form of closed magnetic lines forming a knot . in frames of this model",
    "one can account for the relatively long life time of a ball lightning .",
    "it is worth to be noticed that though the properties of low energy fireballs can be accounted for within mentioned above models they are unlikely to explain its regular geometrical shape .",
    "the author of the present work has never observed a ball lightning , however according to the witnesses a fireball resembles a regular sphere .",
    "there are many other ball lightning models which are outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "* there are both high and low energy ball lightnings",
    ". the energy of a low energy ball lightning can be below several hundred  kj",
    ". however the energy of a high energy one can be up to @xmath123 .",
    "* there are witnesses that a ball lightning can penetrate through a window glass .",
    "sometimes it uses existing microscopic holes without destruction of the form of a ball lightning .",
    "it means that the actual size of a ball lightning is rather small and its visible size of several centimeters is caused by some secondary effects .",
    "quite often a ball lightning can burn tiny holes inside materials like glass to pass through them .",
    "it signifies that the internal temperature and pressure are very high in the central region . *",
    "a fireball is able to follow the electric field lines .",
    "it is the indirect indication that a ball lightning has electromagnetic nature , e.g. , consists of plasma .",
    "* a ball lightning has very long life - time , about several minutes . in sec .",
    "[ intr ] we mentioned that unstructured plasma without external energy source looses its energy and recombines extremely fast .",
    "if we rely on the plasma models of a ball lightning , it means that either there is an energy source inside of the system or plasma is structured and there exists a mechanism which prevents the friction in the electrons motion .",
    "* in some cases there were reports that a ball lightning could produce rather strong electromagnetic radiation even in the x - ray range .",
    "it might signify that energetic processes , e.g. nuclear fusion reactions , can happen inside a fireball .",
    "quantum oscillations of electron gas in plasma  @xcite can be a suitable model for a ball lightning .",
    "for example , it explains the existence of two types of ball lightnings , low and high energy ones .",
    "our model accounts for the very small @xmath124 and dense central region as well as indirectly points out on the possible microdose nuclear fusion reactions inside of a high energy ball lightning .    in the present paper we suggested that superconductivity could support long life - time of a low energy fireball and described that this phenomenon could exist in frames of our model .",
    "it is unlikely that nuclear fusion reactions can take place inside a low energy ball lightning , i.e. this type of a ball lightning can not have an internal energy source .",
    "moreover as we mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , electrons participating in spherically symmetrical oscillations can not emit electromagnetic radiation .",
    "it means that the system does not loose the energy in the form of radiation . as a direct consequence of our model we get the regular spherical form of a fireball gratis . in sec .",
    "[ le ] we made the numerical simulations for the temperature range @xmath125 . according to the fireball witnesses  @xcite some low energy ball lightnings",
    "do not combust materials like paper , wood etc .",
    "the combustion temperature of these materials lie in the mentioned above range .",
    "it justifies our assumption .",
    "note the a ball lightning seems to be a many - sided phenomenon and we do not claim that our model explains all the existing electrical atmospheric phenomena which look like a ball lightning .",
    "however in our opinion a certain class of fireballs with the above listed properties is satisfactory accounted for within the model based on quantum oscillations of electron gas in plasma .",
