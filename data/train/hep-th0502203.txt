    "energy conditions , or restrictions on the matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 , play an important role in general relativity .",
    "no classification of the solutions to einstein s equation is possible without restrictions on @xmath2 , since every spacetime is a solution for some particular choice of energy - momentum tensor . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate a direct connection between stability and the null energy condition ( nec ) @xcite , @xmath3 for any null vector @xmath4 ( satisfying @xmath5 ) .",
    "our main results are : ( 1 ) classical solutions of scalar - gauge models which violate the nec are unstable , ( 2 ) a quantum state ( including fermions ) in which the expectation of the energy - momentum tensor violates the nec can not be the ground state , ( 3 ) perfect fluids which violate the nec are unstable .",
    "these results suggest that violations of the nec in physically interesting cases are likely to be only ephemeral .",
    "our results have immediate applications to the dark energy equation of state , often given in terms of @xmath6 .",
    "dark energy has positive energy density @xmath7 and energy - momentum tensor @xmath8 in the comoving cosmological frame .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 implies violation of the nec .",
    "instability as a consequence of @xmath9 was studied previously in scalar models  @xcite .",
    "some results in relativity in which the nec plays an important role include the classical singularity theorems @xcite , proposed covariant entropy bounds @xcite and non - existence of lorentzian wormholes  @xcite .",
    "consider a theory of scalar , @xmath10 , and gauge , @xmath11 , fields in a fixed @xmath12-dimensional space - time with the metric @xmath13 .",
    "we limit ourselves to theories whose equations of motion are second order differential equations , so the lagrangian for the system is assumed to depend only on the fields and their first derivatives .",
    "we take the lagrangian density @xmath14 to depend only on the covariant derivative of the field @xmath15 and the gauge field strength @xmath16 .",
    "the scalars may transform in any representation of the gauge group .",
    "we impose lorentz invariance on @xmath14 , but do not require overall gauge invariance .",
    "that is , we allow for fixed tensors with gauge indices ( but no lorentz indices ) which can be contracted with the fields . for the corresponding action @xmath17 to be stationary , its first variation has to vanish , @xmath18 .",
    "this leads to the equations of motion for the fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; in the classical analysis we assume that we have found solutions to these equations , about which we expand .",
    "the quantities @xmath15 and @xmath19 are independent variables .",
    "nevertheless we now prove that there is a relation between the derivatives of @xmath14 with respect to them : @xmath20 in our notation @xmath21 , where the abstract index @xmath22 may run over both lorentz and color indices , as well as the type of field .",
    "so , @xmath23 is a list of objects , each of which has a lorentz index @xmath24 .",
    "the value of @xmath22 specifies an element of this list .",
    "the relations are obtained by noting that for each and every @xmath19 in @xmath14 there are two @xmath25s attached to it , except for the curved space totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath26 , which gives rise to the @xmath27 term in eq .",
    "( [ ft : m.g ] ) .",
    "similarly , differentiation with respect to @xmath23 yields the @xmath28 and @xmath29 terms in eq .",
    "( [ ft : m.psi ] ) .",
    "figure  [ figure ] represents the most general lagrangian of type considered in this paper .",
    "each dot represents a lorentz index and a line connecting them denotes contraction using the metric .",
    "rectangles ( with two indices ) are field strengths , small circles covariant derivatives of scalar fields , and a large circle an epsilon tensor . finally , the block @xmath30 represents the remainder of the diagram .",
    "because the product of two epsilon tensors can be rewritten as a sum of products of metric tensors @xmath31 , we need to consider only figures with at most one epsilon tensor , and therefore can assume that @xmath30 contains none .",
    "( for generality , we include an epsilon tensor in the figure , although of course @xmath14 need not contain a parity - violating component . )",
    "all lorentz indices are ultimately contracted , and we suppress color indices for simplicity",
    ".     represents the remainder of the diagram .",
    "all lorentz indices are ultimately contracted , and we suppress color indices for simplicity . in graphical terms , @xmath28 is obtained by simply removing the shaded elements.,width=226 ]    consider the labelled portion of the figure , which equals @xmath32 again , we suppress color indices for simplicity , as they do not affect the proof .",
    "we include an epsilon tensor in the analysis , although @xmath14 may or may not contain one ( in the parity - preserving case the epsilon tensor in eq .",
    "( [ ft : m.l ] ) is replaced by the metric ) . by differentiation of the indicated portion , we obtain eqs .",
    "( [ ft : m.g ] ) and ( [ ft : m.psi ] ) with @xmath33 note the derivative @xmath34 generates a contribution to @xmath28 which is matched by a corresponding contribution from @xmath35 .",
    "other contractions of fields with @xmath36 ( i.e. , as indicated in the figure ) can be analyzed similarly . in graphical terms",
    ", @xmath28 can be obtained from the figure for @xmath14 by simply removing two @xmath25s , in this case the shaded elements of the figure .    for the energy - momentum tensor which couples to gravity , @xmath37",
    "the nec then requires @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "thus , to satisfy the nec , @xmath40 has to be positive semidefinite .",
    "this property is crucial for stability of solutions , to which we now turn .      to study the stability of the solution @xmath41 , we consider the second variation of the lagrangian , @xmath42 here quantities @xmath43 , etc .",
    "are evaluated at @xmath41 .",
    "also notice that @xmath44 , the covariant derivatives of @xmath45 , are different from @xmath21 .",
    "let us use a locally inertial frame in which the metric is reduced to @xmath46 ; all quantities in this frame are designated by a bar . for the lagrangian  ( [ ft : d2l ] ) , the canonical momentum is @xmath47 which leads to the following effective hamiltonian for fluctuations about the classical solution : @xmath48 here @xmath49 are functions of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 as found from eq .",
    "( [ ft : dpi ] ) .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ft : d2h ] ) is a potential term , which we denote by @xmath53 , and the last two terms are kinetic terms , denoted @xmath54 .",
    "if the kinetic energy @xmath54 is negative , then the system described by the hamiltonian @xmath55 is ( locally ) unstable .",
    "if @xmath53 is positive then small perturbations will cause the classical solutions to grow exponentially away from the original stationary point .",
    "however , it is possible to have classical stability if one chooses @xmath53 to be negative ; in this case we have an upside - down potential with negative kinetic term , or a `` phantom '' .",
    "such models necessarily exhibit quantum instabilities @xcite .",
    "notice , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ ft : d2h ] ) is linear in the fluctuations and their derivatives , and therefore can never stabilize the system .    to investigate the kinetic terms ,",
    "we calculate second derivatives of @xmath14 needed in eq .",
    "( [ ft : d2h ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ ft : m.psi ] ) we obtain @xmath56 the separation of the second derivative into the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ ft : mn ] ) is natural : @xmath19 appears only in the first term , and @xmath57 represents all remaining terms .",
    "@xmath57 contains terms obtained by differentiating @xmath28 and @xmath29 with respect to @xmath58 , plus additional terms if @xmath25 is a field strength .",
    "the @xmath59 index obtained from these @xmath58 derivatives is attached to a field and not the metric @xmath60 .",
    "( also , @xmath29 does not contain an epsilon tensor since @xmath30 does not . ) finally , notice that even though @xmath23 and @xmath61 differ , the derivatives of @xmath14 with respect to them coincide due to the form of the action  ( [ ft : s ] ) .",
    "thus the kinetic term becomes @xmath62    we now prove that nonnegativeness of the kinetic term @xmath54 implies positive semidefiniteness of the matrix @xmath28 . indeed , suppose that @xmath28 is not positive semidefinite . in such case , the matrix @xmath28 has at least one negative eigenvalue , which means that there is a basis in which the matrix is diagonal with at least one negative entry , @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "( quantities in this basis are designated with a tilde . )",
    "let us choose such field variations that are nonzero only in the direction of the negative eigenvalue : @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "we further restrict @xmath68 quantities @xmath69 to satisfy the following equation : @xmath70 these conditions make the kinetic term of eq .",
    "( [ ft : d2k ] ) negative , @xmath71 < 0 ,    \\label{ft : d2k1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus proving that in order for @xmath54 to be nonnegative , the matrix @xmath28 has to be positive semidefinite .    using the result established in the previous paragraph",
    ", we conclude that solutions to the theory given by the action  ( [ ft : s ] ) are stable only if the matrix @xmath28 is positive semidefinite .    combining the relations between nonnegativeness of @xmath54 and positive semidefiniteness of @xmath28 on one hand , and the nec and positive semidefiniteness of @xmath28 on the the other hand ,",
    "we conclude that for the theory given by the action  ( [ ft : s ] ) , only solutions satisfying the nec can be stable",
    ".    we can deduce similar results for quantum systems .",
    "suppose there exists a quantum state @xmath72 and a null vector @xmath73 such that @xmath74 so that the nec is violated in a quantum averaged sense .",
    "define a basis @xmath75 in which the operator @xmath76 is diagonal : @xmath77 then violation of the quantum averaged nec implies @xmath78 this means that there exist eigenstates @xmath75 , whose overlap with @xmath79 is non - zero and on which the operator @xmath80 has negative eigenvalues .",
    "this requires that @xmath28 and hence @xmath54 is not positive semidefinite ; by continuity , this must also be the case in a ball @xmath81 in the hilbert space of @xmath82 .",
    "as a further consequence , we can conclude that a state @xmath83 in which the nec is violated can not be the ground state  .",
    "suppose that @xmath72 is an energy eigenstate : @xmath84 .",
    "an elementary result from quantum mechanics is that @xmath83 can be the ground state only if @xmath85 for all normalized states @xmath86 which need not be energy eigenstates .",
    "however , it is possible to reduce the expectation value of @xmath87 by perturbing @xmath72 . specifically , we adjust @xmath72 only in the ball @xmath81 , where we know from eqs .",
    "( [ ft : d2k])([ft : d2k1 ] ) that there are perturbations which reduce the expectation of the kinetic energy without changing the expectation of the potential .",
    "note that the discussion above is in terms of unrenormalized ( bare ) quantities .",
    "the renormalized expectation @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 is the flat - space qft ground state ) could be negative ( e.g. , as in the casimir effect @xcite ) , but this is possible only if @xmath72 is not @xmath89 .    in known cases of nec violation , such as the casimir vacuum or black hole spacetime , it is only the _",
    "renormalized _ energy - momentum tensor which violates the nec . as a simple example , consider a real scalar field @xmath90 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is simply @xmath91 plus terms proportional to @xmath13 which do not play a role in the nec .",
    "then , @xmath92 is a hermitian operator with positive eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , its expectation value in _ any _ state is positive : @xmath93 for any @xmath72 , including the hartle - hawking , casimir or flat - space vacuum .",
    "we can verify this by direct calculation , computing the energy - momentum tensor using point - splitting regularization : @xmath94 ^ 2 } { \\pi^2 \\vert x - x'\\vert^6},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is manifestly positive .",
    "note that @xmath95 for all @xmath72 , since the bare expectation is always dominated by the uv contribution .",
    "now , had we taken a _",
    "negative _ kinetic energy term for the scalar , the overall sign of @xmath80 would change , allowing violation of the nec .",
    "but , this model is clearly unstable , in accordance with our results .      to this point",
    "we have only considered bosonic fields .",
    "we now extend our analysis to systems with fermions , adding to our lagrangian the term @xmath96 ( a scalar - fermion coupling can be treated similarly , as can a weyl fermion , whose determinant is the square root of the dirac determinant . ) then , for any fixed gauge field background the fermions can be integrated out directly in favor of a non - local correction to the action for bosonic fields @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the eigenvalue equation for the dirac operator , with @xmath99 real .",
    "this shifts the energy - momentum tensor by    @xmath100    now write @xmath101 and use the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions to obtain @xmath102 where the ellipsis denote terms which do not contain @xmath19 . after integration by parts ,",
    "the contribution to the nec from fermions is then @xmath103 this additional contribution is always positive .",
    "so , the conclusions of the previous section are unmodified by the presence of fermions : violation of the nec implies the bosonic kinetic energy is not positive semidefinite .",
    "a macroscopic system may be approximately described as a perfect fluid if the mean free path of its components is small compared to the length scale of interest . for the dark energy ,",
    "this length scale is of cosmological size .",
    "a perfect fluid is described by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath104 where @xmath7 and @xmath105 are the energy density and pressure of the fluid in its rest frame , and @xmath106 is its velocity .",
    "let @xmath107 be the conserved current vector ( @xmath108 ) , and @xmath109 the particle density .",
    "recall that the speed of sound in a fluid is given by @xmath117 , and that complex @xmath118 implies an instability .",
    "note @xmath115 can not change its sign without producing an instability . indeed ,",
    "if it were to change its sign at some @xmath119 , then @xmath118 would be complex for either @xmath120 larger or smaller than @xmath119 , depending on the sign of @xmath121 .",
    "( @xmath122 can not also change sign at @xmath119 . ) therefore , if @xmath123 is negative anywhere , then it is negative everywhere , and to avoid complex @xmath118 , @xmath122 must be negative everywhere .",
    "however , if @xmath123 and @xmath122 are everywhere negative , then the fluid is unstable with respect to clumping . to see this , we first deduce the dependence of the fluid free energy @xmath124 on particle number @xmath125 .",
    "note that @xmath126 . by integration",
    "we find @xmath127 $ ] , where the first term is just the energy @xmath128 and @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the entropy .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath131 .",
    "now consider two adjacent regions of the fluid with identical volumes .",
    "suppose we transfer a small amount of matter @xmath132 from one volume to another ; the resulting change in total free energy is given by @xmath133 .",
    "we see that the system can decrease its free energy by clumping into over- and under - dense regions .",
    "this itself is an instability , which results in a runaway to infinitely negative free energy unless the assumption of negative @xmath123 ( violation of nec ) or negative @xmath122 ( real @xmath118 ) ceases to hold",
