    "over the past decade or so two separate developments have occurred in computer science whose intersection promises to open a vast new area of research , an area extending far beyond the current boundaries of computer science .",
    "the first of these developments is the growing realization of how useful it would be to be able to control distributed systems that have little ( if any ) centralized communication , and to do so `` adaptively '' , with minimal reliance on detailed knowledge of the system s small - scale dynamical behavior .",
    "the second development is the maturing of the discipline of reinforcement learning ( rl ) .",
    "this is the branch of machine learning that is concerned with an agent who periodically receives `` reward '' signals from the environment that partially reflect the value of that agent s private utility function .",
    "the goal of an rl algorithm is to determine how , using those reward signals , the agent should update its action policy to maximize its utility  @xcite .",
    "( until our detailed discussions below , we will use the term `` reinforcement learning '' broadly , to include any algorithm of this sort , including ones that rely on detailed bayesian modeling of underlying markov processes  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , one might hope that rl would help us solve the distributed control problem , since rl is adaptive , and , in particular , since it is not restricted to domains having sufficient breadths of communication .",
    "however , by itself , conventional single - agent rl does not provide a means for controlling large , distributed systems .",
    "this is true even if the system @xmath0 have centralized communication .",
    "the problem is that the space of possible action policies for such systems is too big to be searched .",
    "we might imagine as a variant using a large set of agents , each controlling only part of the system .",
    "since the individual action spaces of such agents would be relatively small , we could realistically deploy conventional rl on each one .",
    "however , now we face the central question of how to map the world utility function concerning the overall system into private utility functions for each of the agents .",
    "in particular , how should we design those private utility functions so that each agent can realistically hope to optimize its function , and at the same time the collective behavior of the agents will optimize the world utility ?    we use the term `` collective intelligence '' ( coin ) to refer to any pair of a large , distributed collection of interacting computational processes among which there is little to no centralized communication or control , together with a ` world utility ' function that rates the possible dynamic histories of the collection .",
    "the central coin design problem we consider arises when the computational processes run rl algorithms : how , without any detailed modeling of the overall system , can one set the utility functions for the rl algorithms in a coin to have the overall dynamics reliably and robustly achieve large values of the provided world utility ?",
    "the benefits of an answer to this question would extend beyond the many branches of computer science , having major ramifications for many other sciences as well .",
    "section  [ sec : back ] discusses some of those benefits .",
    "section  [ sec : lit ] reviews previous work that has bearing on the coin design problem .",
    "section  [ sec : math ] section constitutes the core of this chapter .",
    "it presents a quick outline of a promising mathematical framework for addressing this problem in its most general form , and then experimental illustrations of the prescriptions of that framework . throughout",
    ", we will use italics for emphasis , single quotes for informally defined terms , and double quotes to delineate colloquial terminology .",
    "there are many design problems that involve distributed computational systems where there are strong restrictions on centralized communication ( `` we ca nt all talk '' ) ; or there is communication with a central processor , but that processor is not sufficiently powerful to determine how to control the entire system ( `` we are nt smart enough '' ) ; or the processor is powerful enough in principle , but it is not clear what algorithm it could run by itself that would effectively control the entire system ( `` we do nt know what to think '' ) .",
    "just a few of the potential examples include :    \\i ) designing a control system for constellations of communication satellites or for constellations of planetary exploration vehicles ( world utility in the latter case being some measure of quality of scientific data collected ) ;    \\ii ) designing a control system for routing over a communication network ( world utility being some aggregate quality of service measure )    \\iii ) construction of parallel algorithms for solving numerical optimization problems ( the optimization problem itself constituting the world utility ) ;    \\iv ) vehicular traffic control , _",
    "e.g. _ , air traffic control , or high - occupancy toll - lanes for automobiles .",
    "( in these problems the individual agents are humans and the associated utility functions must be of a constrained form , reflecting the relatively inflexible kinds of preferences humans possess . ) ;    \\v ) routing over a power grid ;    \\vi ) control of a large , distributed chemical plant ;    \\vii ) control of the elements of an amorphous computer ;    \\viii ) control of the elements of a ` noisy ' phased array radar ;    \\ix ) compute - serving over an information grid .",
    "such systems may be best controlled with an artificial coin .",
    "however , the potential usefulness of deeper understanding of how to tackle the coin design problem extends far beyond such engineering concerns . that s because the coin design problem is an inverse problem , whereas essentially all of the scientific fields that are concerned with naturally - occurring distributed systems analyze them purely as a `` forward problem . ''",
    "that is , those fields analyze what global behavior would arise from provided local dynamical laws , rather than grapple with the inverse problem of how to configure those laws to induce desired global behavior .",
    "( indeed , the coin design problem could almost be defined as decentralized adaptive control theory for massively distributed stochastic environments . )",
    "it seems plausible that the insights garnered from understanding the inverse problem would provide a trenchant novel perspective on those fields . just as tackling the inverse problem in the design of steam engines led to the first true understanding of the macroscopic properties of physical bodes ( aka thermodynamics ) , so may the cracking of the coin design problem may improve our understanding of many naturally - occurring coins .",
    "in addition , although the focuses of those other fields are not on the coin design problem , in that they are related to the coin design problem , that problem may be able to serve as a `` touchstone '' for all those fields",
    ". this may then reveal novel connections between the fields .",
    "as an example of how understanding the coin design problem may provide a novel perspective on other fields , consider countries with capitalist human economies .",
    "although there is no intrinsic world utility in such systems , they can still be viewed from the perspective of coins , as naturally occurring coins .",
    "for example , one can declare world utility to be a time average of the gross domestic product ( gdp ) of the country in question .",
    "( world utility per se is not a construction internal to a human economy , but rather something defined from the outside . )",
    "the reward functions for the human agents in this example could then be the achievements of their personal goals ( usually involving personal wealth to some degree ) .    now in general , to achieve high world utility in a coin it is necessary to avoid having the agents work at cross - purposes .",
    "otherwise the system is vulnerable to economic phenomena like the tragedy of the commons ( toc ) , in which individual avarice works to lower world utility  @xcite , or the liquidity trap , where behavior that helps the entire system when employed by some agents results in poor global behavior when employed by all agents  @xcite .",
    "one way to avoid such phenomena is by modifying the agents utility functions . in the context of capitalist economies ,",
    "this kind of effect can be achieved via punitive legislation that modifies the rewards the agents receive for engaging in certain kinds of activity .",
    "a real world example of an attempt to make just such a modification was the creation of anti - trust regulations designed to prevent monopolistic practices .",
    "in designing a coin we usually have more freedom than anti - trust regulators though , in that there is no base - line `` organic '' private utility function over which we must superimpose legislation - like incentives .",
    "rather , the entire `` psychology '' of the individual agents is at our disposal when designing a coin .",
    "this obviates the need for honesty - elicitation ( ` incentive compatible ' ) mechanisms , like auctions , which form a central component of conventional economics .",
    "accordingly , coins can differ in certain crucial respects from human economies .",
    "the precise differences  the subject of current research  seem likely to present many insights into the functioning of economic structures like anti - trust regulators .    to continue with this example , consider the usefulness , as far as the world utility is concerned , of having ( commodity , or especially fiat ) money in the coin .",
    "formally , from a coin perspective , the use of ` money ' for trading between agents constitutes a particular class of couplings between the states and utility functions of the various agents .",
    "for example , if one agent s ` bank account ' variable goes up in a ` trade ' with another agent , then a corresponding ` bank account ' variable in that other agent must decrease to compensate .",
    "in addition to this coupling between the agents states , there is also a coupling between their utilities , if one assume that both agents will prefer to have more money rather than less , everything else being equal .",
    "however one might formally define such a ` money ' structure , we can consider what happens if it does ( or does not ) obtain for an arbitrary dynamical system , in the context of an arbitrary world utility .",
    "for some such dynamical systems and world utilities , a money structure will improve the value of that world utility .",
    "but for the same dynamics , the use of a money structure will simultaneously induce _ low levels _ of other world utilities ( a trivial example being a world utility that equals the negative of the first one ) .",
    "this raises a host of questions , like how to formally specify the most general set of world utilities that benefits significantly from using money - based private utility functions .",
    "if one is provided a world utility that is not a member of that set , then an `` economics - like '' configuration of the system is likely to result in poor performance .",
    "such a characterization of how and when money helps improve world utilities of various sorts might have important implications for conventional human economics , especially when one chooses world utility to be one of the more popular choices for social welfare function .",
    "( see  @xcite and references therein for some of the standard economics work that is most relevant to this issue . )",
    "there are many other scientific fields that are currently under investigation from a coin - design perspective",
    ". some of them are , like economics , part of ( or at least closely related to ) the social sciences .",
    "these fields typically involve rl algorithms under the guise of human agents .",
    "an example of such a field is game theory , especially game theory of bounded rational players . as illustrated in our money example , viewing such systems from the perspective of a non - endogenous world utility , _",
    "i.e. _ , from a coin - design perspective , holds the potential for providing novel insight into them .",
    "( in the case of game theory , it holds the potential for leading to deeper understanding of many - player inverse stochastic game theory . )",
    "however there are other scientific fields that might benefit from a coin - design perspective even though they study systems that do nt even involve rl algorithms .",
    "the idea here is that if we viewed such systems from an `` artificial '' teleological perspective , both in concentrating on a non - endogenous world utility and in casting the nodal elements of the system as rl algorithms , we could learn a lot about the form of the ` design space ' in which such systems live .",
    "( just as in economics , where the individual nodal elements _ are _ rl algorithms , investigating the system using an externally imposed world utility might lead to insight . )",
    "examples here are ecosystems ( individual genes , individuals , or species being the nodal elements ) and cells ( individual organelles in eukaryotes being the nodal elements ) . in both cases ,",
    "the world utility could involve robustness of the desired equilibrium against external perturbation , efficient exploitation of free energy in the environment , etc .",
    "the following list elaborates what we mean by a coin :    \\1 ) there are many processors running concurrently , performing actions that affect one another s behavior .",
    "\\2 ) there is little to no centralized personalized communication , _",
    "i.e. _ , little to no behavior in which a small subset of the processors not only communicates with all the other processors , but communicates differently with each one of those other processors .",
    "any single processor s `` broadcasting '' the same information to all other processors is not precluded .",
    "\\3 ) there is little to no centralized personalized control , _",
    "i.e. _ , little to no behavior in which a small subset of the processors not only controls all the other processors , but controls each one of those other processors differently .",
    "`` broadcasting '' the same control signal to all other processors is not precluded .",
    "\\4 ) there is a well - specified task , typically in the form of extremizing a utility function , that concerns the behavior of the entire distributed system .",
    "so we are confronted with the inverse problem of how to configure the system to achieve the task .",
    "the following elements characterize the sorts of approaches to coin design we are concerned with here :    \\5 ) the approach for tackling ( 4 ) is scalable to very large numbers of processors .",
    "\\6 ) the approach for tackling ( 4 ) is very broadly applicable . in particular",
    ", it can work when little ( if any ) `` broadcasting '' as in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is possible .",
    "\\7 ) the approach for tackling ( 4 ) involves little to no hand - tailoring .",
    "\\8 ) the approach for tackling ( 4 ) is robust and adaptive , with minimal need to `` get the details exactly right or else , '' as far as the stochastic dynamics of the system is concerned .",
    "\\9 ) the individual processors are running rl algorithms . unlike the other elements of this list ,",
    "this one is not an _ a priori _ engineering necessity .",
    "rather , it is a reflection of the fact that rl algorithms are currently the best - understood and most mature technology for addressing the points ( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "there are many approaches to coin design that do not have every one of those features .",
    "these approaches constitute part of the overall field of coin design .",
    "as discussed below though , not having every feature in our list , no single one of those approaches can be extended to cover the entire breadth of the field of coin design .",
    "( this is not too surprising , since those approaches are parts of fields whose focus is not the coin design problem per se . )",
    "the rest of this section consists of brief presentations of some of these approaches , and in particular characterizes them in terms of our list of nine characteristics of coins and of our desiredata for their design . of the approaches we discuss , at present it is probably the ones in artificial intelligence and machine learning that are most directly applicable to coin design .",
    "however it is fairly clear how to exploit those approaches for coin design , and in that sense relatively little needs to be said about them .",
    "in contrast , as currently employed , the toolsets in the social sciences are not as immediately applicable to coin design .",
    "however , it seems likely that there is more yet to be discovered about how to exploit them for coin design .",
    "accordingly , we devote more space to those social science - based approaches here .",
    "we present an approach that holds promise for covering all nine of our desired features in section  [ sec : math ] .",
    "there is an extensive body of work in ai and machine learning that is related to coin design . indeed",
    ", one of the most famous speculative works in the field can be viewed as an argument that ai should be approached as a coin design problem  @xcite .",
    "much work of a more concrete nature is also closely related to the problem of coin design .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the maturing field of reinforcement learning provides a much needed tool for the types of problems addressed by coins .",
    "because rl generally provides model - free and `` online '' learning features , it is ideally suited for the distributed environment where a `` teacher '' is not available and the agents need to learn successful strategies based on `` rewards '' and `` penalties '' they receive from the overall system at various intervals .",
    "it is even possible for the learners to use those rewards to modify _ how _ they learn  @xcite .",
    "although work on rl dates back to samuel s checker player  @xcite , relatively recent theoretical  @xcite and empirical results  @xcite have made rl one of the most active areas in machine learning .",
    "many problems ranging from controlling a robot s gait to controlling a chemical plant to allocating constrained resource have been addressed with considerable success using rl  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the rl algorithms @xmath1 ( which rates potential states based on a _ value function _ )  @xcite and @xmath2learning ( which rates action - state pairs )  @xcite have been investigated extensively .",
    "a detailed investigation of rl is available in  @xcite .",
    "although powerful and widely applicable , solitary rl algorithms will not perform well on large distributed heterogeneous problems in general .",
    "this is due to the very big size of the action - policy space for such problems .",
    "in addition , without centralized communication and control , how a solitary rl algorithm could run the full system at all , poorly or well , becomes a major concern .",
    "for these reasons , it is natural to consider deploying many rl algorithms rather than a single one for these large distributed problems .",
    "we will discuss the coordination issues such an approach raises in conjunction with multi - agent systems in section  [ sec : mas ] and with learnability in coins in section  [ sec : math ] .",
    "the field of distributed artificial intelligence ( dai ) has arisen as more and more traditional artificial intelligence ( ai ) tasks have migrated toward parallel implementation .",
    "the most direct approach to such implementations is to directly parallelize ai production systems or the underlying programming languages  @xcite .",
    "an alternative and more challenging approach is to use distributed computing , where not only are the individual reasoning , planning and scheduling ai tasks parallelized , but there are _ different modules _ with different such tasks , concurrently working toward a common goal  @xcite .    in a dai",
    ", one needs to ensure that the task has been modularized in a way that improves efficiency .",
    "unfortunately , this usually requires a central controller whose purpose is to allocate tasks and process the associated results .",
    "moreover , designing that controller in a traditional ai fashion often results in brittle solutions .",
    "accordingly , recently there has been a move toward both more autonomous modules and fewer restrictions on the interactions among the modules  @xcite .    despite this evolution",
    ", dai maintains the traditional ai concern with a pre - fixed set of _ particular _ aspects of intelligent behavior ( _ e.g. _ reasoning , understanding , learning etc . ) rather than on their _ cumulative _ character .",
    "as the idea that intelligence may have more to do with the interaction among components started to take shape  @xcite , focus shifted to concepts ( _ e.g. _ , multi - agent systems ) that better incorporated that idea  @xcite .      the field of multi - agent systems ( mas ) is concerned with the interactions among the members of such a set of agents  @xcite , as well as the inner workings of each agent in such a set ( _ e.g. _ , their learning algorithms )  @xcite . as in computational ecologies and computational markets ( see below ) , a well - designed mas is one that achieves a global task through the actions of its components .",
    "the associated design steps involve  @xcite :    1 .",
    "decomposing a global task into distributable subcomponents , yielding tractable tasks for each agent ; 2 .   establishing communication channels that provide sufficient information to each of the agents for it to achieve its task , but are not too unwieldly for the overall system to sustain ; and 3 .",
    "coordinating the agents in a way that ensures that they cooperate on the global task , or at the very least does not allow them to pursue conflicting strategies in trying to achieve their tasks .",
    "step ( 3 ) is rarely trivial ; one of the main difficulties encountered in mas design is that agents act selfishly and artificial cooperation structures have to be imposed on their behavior to enforce cooperation  @xcite .",
    "an active area of research , which holds promise for addressing parts the coin design problem , is to determine how selfish agents `` incentives '' have to be engineered in order to avoid the tragedy of the commons ( toc )  @xcite .",
    "( this work draws on the economics literature , which we review separately below . ) when simply providing the right incentives is not sufficient , one can resort to strategies that actively induce agents to cooperate rather than act selfishly . in such cases coordination  @xcite , negotiations  @xcite",
    ", coalition formation  @xcite or contracting  @xcite among agents may be needed to ensure that they do not work at cross purposes .",
    "unfortunately , all of these approaches share with dai and its offshoots the problem of relying excessively on hand - tailoring , and therefore being difficult to scale and often nonrobust .",
    "in addition , except as noted in the next subsection , they involve no rl , and therefore the constituent computational elements are usually not as adaptive and robust as we would like .      because it neither requires explicit modeling of the environment nor having a `` teacher '' that provides the `` correct '' actions , the approach of having the individual agents in a mas use rl is well - suited for mas s deployed in domains where one has little knowledge about the environment and/or other agents .",
    "there are two main approaches to designing such mas s : + ( i ) one has ` solipsistic agents ' that do nt know about each other and whose rl rewards are given by the performance of the entire system ( so the joint actions of all other agents form an `` inanimate background '' contributing to the reward signal each agent receives ) ; + ( ii ) one has ` social agents ' that explicitly model each other and take each others actions into account .    both ( i ) and ( ii ) can be viewed as ways to ( try to ) coordinate the agents in a mas in a robust fashion .",
    "* solipsistic agents : * mas s with solipsistic agents have been successfully applied to a multitude of problems  @xcite .",
    "generally , these schemes use rl algorithms similar to those discussed in section  [ sec : control ] .",
    "however much of this work lacks a well - defined global task or broad applicability ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , none of the work with solipsistic agents scales well .",
    "( as illustrated in our experiments on the `` bar problem '' , recounted below . )",
    "the problem is that each agent must be able to discern the effect of its actions on the overall performance of the system , since that performance constitutes its reward signal .",
    "as the number of agents increases though , the effects of any one agent s actions ( signal ) will be swamped by the effects of other agents ( noise ) , making the agent unable to learn well , if at all .",
    "( see the discussion below on learnability . ) in addition , of course , solipsistic agents can not be used in situations lacking centralized calculation and broadcast of the single global reward signal .",
    "* social agents : * mas s whose agents take the actions of other agents into account synthesize rl with game theoretic concepts ( _ e.g. _ , nash equilibrium ) .",
    "they do this to try to ensure that the overall system both moves toward achieving the overall global goal and avoids often deleterious oscillatory behavior  @xcite .",
    "to that end , the agents incorporate internal mechanisms that actively model the behavior of other agents . in section  [ sec : bar ] , we discuss a situation where such modeling is necessarily self - defeating .",
    "more generally , this approach usually involves extensive hand - tailoring for the problem at hand .",
    "some human economies provides examples of naturally occurring systems that can be viewed as a ( more or less ) well - performing coin .",
    "the field of economics provides much more though . both empirical economics ( _ e.g. _ , economic history , experimental economics ) and theoretical economics ( _ e.g. _ , general equilibrium theory  @xcite , theory of optimal taxation  @xcite ) provide a rich literature on strategic situations where many parties interact .",
    "in fact , much of the entire field of economics can be viewed as concerning how to maximize certain constrained kinds of world utilities , when there are certain ( very strong ) restrictions on the individual agents and their interactions , and in particular when we have limited freedom in setting either the utility functions of those agents or modifying their rl algorithms in any other way .    in this section we summarize just two economic concepts , both of which are very closely related to coins , in that they deal with how a large number of interacting agents can function in a stable and efficient manner : general equilibrium theory and mechanism design .",
    "we then discuss general attempts to apply those concepts to distributed computational problems .",
    "we follow this with a discussion of game theory , and then present a particular celebrated toy - world problem that involves many of these issues .",
    "often the first version of `` equilibrium '' that one encounters in economics is that of supply and demand in single markets : the price of the market s good is determined by where the supply and demand curves for that good intersect . in cases where there is interaction among multiple markets however , even when",
    "there is no production but only trading , one can not simply determine the price of each market s good individually , as both the supply and demand for each good depends on the supply / demand of other goods . considering the price fluctuations across markets",
    "leads to the concept of ` general equilibrium ' , where prices for each good are determined in such a way to ensure that all markets ` clear '  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , this means that prices are set so the total supply of each good is equal to the demand for that good .",
    "the existence of such an equilibrium , proven in  @xcite , was first postulated by leon walras  @xcite . a mechanism that calculates the equilibrium ( _ i.e. _ , ` market - clearing ' ) prices now bears his name : the walrasian auctioner .    in general , for an arbitrary goal for the overall system , there is no reason to believe that having markets clear achieves that goal . in other words",
    ", there is no _ a priori _ reason why the general equilibrium point should maximize one s provided world utility function .",
    "however , consider the case where one s goal for the overall system is in fact that the markets clear .",
    "in such a context , examine the case where the interactions of real - world agents will induce the overall system to adopt the general equilibrium point , so long as certain broad conditions hold . then if we can impose those conditions",
    ", we can cause the overall system to behave in the manner we wish .",
    "however general equilibrium theory is not sufficient to establish those `` broad conditions '' , since it says little about real - world agents . in particular , general equilibrium theory suffers from having no temporal aspect ( _ i.e. _ , no dynamics ) and from assuming that all the agents are perfectly rational .",
    "another shortcoming of general equilibrium theory as a model of real - world systems is that despite its concerning prices , it does not readily accommodate the full concept of money  @xcite . of",
    "the three main roles money plays in an economy ( medium of exchange in trades , store of value for future trades , and unit of account ) none are essential in a general equilibrium setting . the unit of account aspect is not needed as the bookkeeping is performed by the walrasian auctioner . since the supplies and demands are matched directly there is no need to facilitate trades , and thus no role for money as a medium of exchange . and finally , as the system reaches an equilibrium in one step , through the auctioner , there is no need to store value for future trading rounds  @xcite .",
    "the reason that money is not needed can be traced to the fact that there is an `` overseer '' with global information who guides the system .",
    "if we remove the centralized communication and control exerted by this overseer , then ( as in a real economy ) agents will no longer know the exact details of the overall economy . they will be forced to makes guesses as in any learning system , and the differences in those guesses will lead to differences in their actions  @xcite .",
    "such a decentralized learning - based system more closely resembles a coin than does a conventional general equilibrium system .",
    "in contrast to general equilibrium systems , the three main roles money plays in a human economy are crucial to the dynamics of such a decentralized system  @xcite .",
    "this comports with the important effects in coins of having the agents utility functions involve money ( see background section above ) .      even if there exists centralized communication so that we are nt considering a full - blown coin , if there is no centralized walras - like control , it is usually highly non - trivial to induce the overall system to adopt the general equilibrium point .",
    "one way to try to do so is via an auction .",
    "( this is the approach usually employed in computational markets  see below . ) along with optimal taxation and public good theory  @xcite , the design of auctions is the subject of the field of mechanism design .",
    "more generally , mechanism design is concerned with the incentives that must be applied to any set of agents that interact and exchange goods  @xcite in order to get those agents to exhibit desired behavior .",
    "usually that desired behavior concerns pre - specified utility functions of some sort for each of the individual agents .",
    "in particular , mechanism design is usually concerned with incentive schemes which induce ` ( pareto ) efficient ' ( or ` pareto optimal ' ) allocations in which no agent can be made better off without hurting another agent  @xcite .",
    "one particularly important type of such an incentive scheme is an auction .",
    "when many agents interact in a common environment often there needs to be a structure that supports the exchange of goods or information among those agents .",
    "auctions provide one such ( centralized ) structure for managing exchanges of goods .",
    "for example , in the english auction all the agents come together and ` bid ' for a good , and the price of the good is increased until only one bidder remains , who gets the good in exchange for the resource bid . as another example , in the dutch auction the price of a good is decreased until one buyer is willing to pay the current price .",
    "all auctions perform the same task : match supply and demand . as such , auctions are one of the ways in which price equilibration among a set of interacting agents ( perhaps an equilibration approximating general equilibrium , perhaps not ) can be achieved .",
    "however , an auction mechanism that induces pareto efficiency does not necessarily maximize some other world utility .",
    "for example , in a transaction in an english auction both the seller and the buyer benefit .",
    "they may even have arrived at an allocation which is efficient . however , in that the winner may well have been willing to pay more for the good , such an outcome may confound the goal of the market designer , if that designer s goal is to maximize revenue .",
    "this point is returned to below , in the context of computational economics .",
    "` computational economies ' are schemes inspired by economics , and more specifically by general equilibrium theory and mechanism design theory , for managing the components of a distributed computational system .",
    "they work by having a ` computational market ' , akin to an auction , guide the interactions among those components .",
    "such a market is defined as any structure that allows the components of the system to exchange information on relative valuation of resources ( as in an auction ) , establish equilibrium states ( _ e.g. _ , determine market clearing prices ) and exchange resources ( _ i.e. _ , engage in trades ) .",
    "such computational economies can be used to investigate real economies and biological systems  @xcite .",
    "they can also be used to design distributed computational systems . for example , such computational economies are well - suited to some distributed resource allocation problems , where each component of the system can either directly produce the `` goods '' it needs or acquire them through trades with other components .",
    "computational markets often allow for far more heterogeneity in the components than do conventional resource allocation schemes .",
    "furthermore , there is both theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that such markets are often able to settle to equilibrium states .",
    "for example , auctions find prices that satisfy both the seller and the buyer which results in an increase in the utility of both ( else one or the other would not have agreed to the sale ) .",
    "assuming that all parties are free to pursue trading opportunities , such mechanisms move the system to a point where all possible bilateral trades that could improve the utility of both parties are exhausted .",
    "now restrict attention to the case , implicit in much of computational market work , with the following characteristics : first , world utility can be expressed as a monotonically increasing function @xmath3 where each argument @xmath4 of @xmath3 can in turn be interpreted as the value of a pre - specified utility function @xmath5 for agent @xmath4 .",
    "second , each of those @xmath5 is a function of an @xmath4-indexed ` goods vector ' @xmath6 of the non - perishable goods `` owned '' by agent @xmath4 .",
    "the components of that vector are @xmath7 , and the overall system dynamics is restricted to conserve the vector @xmath8 .",
    "( there are also some other , more technical conditions . ) as an example , the resource allocation problem can be viewed as concerning such vectors of `` owned '' goods .    due to the second of our two conditions , one can integrate a market - clearing mechanism into any system of this sort .",
    "due to the first condition , since in a market equilibrium with non - perishable goods no ( rational ) agent ends up with a value of its utility function lower than the one it started with , the value of the world utility function must be higher at equilibrium than it was initially .",
    "in fact , so long as the individual agents are smart enough to avoid all trades in which they do not benefit , any computational market can only improve this kind of world utility , even if it does not achieve the market equilibrium .",
    "( see the discussion of `` weak triviality '' below . )",
    "this line of reasoning provides one of the main reasons to use computational markets when they can be applied .",
    "conversely , it underscores one of the major limitations of such markets : starting with an arbitrary world utility function with arbitrary dynamical restrictions , it may be quite difficult to cast that function as a monotonically increasing @xmath3 taking as arguments a set of agents goods - vector - based utilities @xmath5 , if we require that those @xmath5 be well - enough behaved that we can reasonably expect the agents to optimize them in a market setting .",
    "one example of a computational economy being used for resource allocation is huberman and clearwater s use of a double  blind auction to solve the complex task of controlling the temperature of a building . in this case , each agent ( individual temperature controller ) bids to buy or sell cool or warm air .",
    "this market mechanism leads to an equitable temperature distribution in the system  @xcite .",
    "other domains where market mechanisms were successfully applied include purchasing memory in an operating systems  @xcite , allocating virtual circuits  @xcite , `` stealing '' unused cpu cycles in a network of computers  @xcite , predicting option futures in financial markets  @xcite , and numerous scheduling and distributed resource allocation problems  @xcite .",
    "computational economics can also be used for tasks not tightly coupled to resource allocation .",
    "for example , following the work of maes  @xcite and ferber  @xcite , baum shows how by using computational markets a large number of agents can interact and cooperate to solve a variant of the blocks world problem  @xcite .    viewed as candidate coins , all market - based computational economics fall short in relying on both centralized communication and centralized control to some degree .",
    "often that reliance is extreme .",
    "for example , the systems investigated by baum not only have the centralized control of a market , but in addition have centralized control of all other non - market aspects of the system .",
    "( indeed , the market is secondary , in that it is only used to decide which single expert among a set of candidate experts gets to exert that centralized control at any given moment ) .",
    "there has also been doubt cast on how well computational economies perform in practice  @xcite , and they also often require extensive hand - tailoring in practice .",
    "finally , return to consideration of a world utility function that is a monotonically increasing function @xmath9 whose arguments are the utilities of the agents . in general , the maximum of such a world utility function will be a pareto optimal point .",
    "so given the utility functions of the agents , by considering all such @xmath9 we map out an infinite set @xmath10 of pareto optimal points that maximize _ some _ such world utility function .",
    "( @xmath10 is usually infinite even if we only consider maximizing those world utilities subject to an overall conservation of goods constraint . ) now the market equilibrium is a pareto optimal point , and therefore lies in @xmath10 .",
    "but it is only one element of @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , it is usually set in full by the utilities of the agents , in concert with the agents initial endowments .",
    "in particular , it is independent of the world utility . in general then , given the utilities of the agents and a world utility @xmath9 , there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe that the particular element in @xmath10 picked out by the auction is the point that maximizes that particular world utility .",
    "this subtlety is rarely addressed in the work on using computational markets to achieve a global goal .",
    "it need not be uncircumventable however . for example , one obvious idea would be to to try to distort the agents _ perceptions _ of their utility functions and/or initial endowments so that the resultant market equilibrium has a higher value of the world utility at hand .",
    "game theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with formalized versions of `` games '' , in the sense of chess , poker , nuclear arms races , and the like  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps easiest to describe it by loosely defining some of its terminology , which we do here and in the next subsection .",
    "the simplest form of a game is that of ` non - cooperative single - stage extensive - form ' game , which involves the following situation : there are two or more agents ( called ` players ' in the literature ) , each of which has a pre - specified set of possible actions that it can follow .",
    "( a ` finite ' game has finite sets of possible actions for all the players . ) in addition , each agent @xmath4 has a utility function ( also called a ` payoff matrix ' for finite games ) .",
    "this maps any ` profile ' of the action choices of all agents to an associated utility value for agent @xmath4 .",
    "( in a ` zero - sum ' game , for every profile , the sum of the payoffs to all the agents is zero . )",
    "the agents choose their actions in a sequence , one after the other .",
    "the structure determining what each agent knows concerning the action choices of the preceding agents is known as the ` information set . '",
    "games in which each agent knows exactly what the preceding ( ` leader ' ) agent did are known as ` stackelberg games ' .",
    "( a variant of such a game is considered in our experiments below .",
    "see also  @xcite . )    in a ` multi - stage ' game , after all the agents choose their first action , each agent is provided some information concerning what the other agents did .",
    "the agent uses this information to choose its next action . in the usual formulation",
    ", each agent gets its payoff at the end of all of the game s stages .",
    "an agent s ` strategy ' is the rule it elects to follow mapping the information it has at each stage of a game to its associated action .",
    "it is a ` pure strategy ' if it is a deterministic rule . if instead the agent s action is chosen by randomly sampling from a distribution , that distribution is known a ` mixed strategy ' .",
    "note that an agent s strategy concerns @xmath11 possible sequences of provided information , even any that can not arise due to the strategies of the other agents .",
    "any multi - stage extensive - form game can be converted into a ` normal form ' game , which is a single - stage game in which each agent is ignorant of the actions of the other agents , so that all agents choose their actions `` simultaneously '' .",
    "this conversion is acieved by having the `` actions '' of each agent in the normal form game correspond to an entire strategy in the associated multi - stage extensive - form game .",
    "the payoffs to all the agents in the normal form game for a particular strategy profile is then given by the associated payoff matrices of the multi - stage extensive form - game .",
    "a ` solution ' to a game , or an ` equilibrium ' , is a profile in which every agent behaves `` rationally '' .",
    "this means that every agent s choice of strategy optimizes its utility subject to a pre - specified set of conditions . in conventional game theory",
    "those conditions involve , at a minimum , perfect knowledge of the payoff matrices of all other players , and often also involve specification of what strategies the other agents adopted and the like . in particular , a ` nash equilibrium ' is a a profile where each agent has chosen the best strategy it can , _ given the choices of the other agents_. a game may have no nash equilibria , one equilibrium , or many equilibria in the space of pure strategies .",
    "a beautiful and seminal theorem due to nash proves that every game has at least one nash equilibrium in the space of mixed strategies  @xcite .",
    "there are several different reasons one might expect a game to result in a nash equilibrium .",
    "one is that it is the point that perfectly rational bayesian agents would adopt , assuming the probability distributions they used to calculate expected payoffs were consistent with one another  @xcite .",
    "a related reason , arising even in a non - bayesian setting , is that a nash equilibrium equilibrium provides `` consistent '' predictions , in that if all parties predict that the game will converge to a nash equilibrium , no one will benefit by changing strategies .",
    "having a consistent prediction does not ensure that all agents payoffs are maximized though .",
    "the study of small perturbations around nash equilibria from a stochastic dynamics perspective is just one example of a ` refinement ' of nash equilibrium , that is a criterion for selecting a single equilibrium state when more than one is present  @xcite .    in cooperative game theory",
    "the agents are able to enter binding contracts with one another , and thereby coordinate their strategies .",
    "this allows the agents to avoid being `` stuck '' in nash equilibria that are pareto inefficient , that is being stuck at equilibrium profiles in which all agents would benefit if only they could agree to all adopt different strategies , with no possibility of betrayal .",
    "characteristic function _ of a game involves subsets ( ` coalitions ' ) of agents playing the game . for each such subset",
    ", it gives the sum of the payoffs of the agents in that subset that those agents can guarantee if they coordinate their strategies .",
    "an @xmath12 is a division of such a guaranteed sum among the members of the coalition .",
    "it is often the case that for a subset of the agents in a coalition one imputation @xmath13 another , meaning that under threat of leaving the coalition that subset of agents can demand the first imputation rather than the second .",
    "so the problem each agent @xmath4 is confronted with in a cooperative game is which set of other agents to form a coalition with , given the characteristic function of the game and the associated imputations @xmath4 can demand of its partners .",
    "there are several different kinds of solution for cooperative games that have received detailed study , varying in how the agents address this problem of who to form a coalition with . some of the more popular are the ` core ' , the ` shapley value ' , the ` stable set solution ' , and the ` nucleolus ' .    in the real world",
    ", the actual underlying game the agents are playing does not only involve the actions considered in cooperative game theory s analysis of coalitions and imputations .",
    "the strategies of that underlying game also involve bargaining behavior , considerations of trying to cheat on a given contract , bluffing and threats , and the like . in many respects , by concentrating on solutions for coalition formation and their relation with the characteristic function , cooperative game theory abstracts away these details of the true underlying game .",
    "conversely though , progress has recently been made in understanding how cooperative games can arise from non - cooperative games , as they must in the real world  @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , game theory has come to play a large role in the field of multi - agent systems .",
    "in addition , due to darwinian natural selection , one might expect game theory to be quite important in population biology , in which the `` utility functions '' of the individual agents can be taken to be their reproductive fitness . as it turns out , there is an entire subfield of game theory concerned with this connection with population biology , called ` evolutionary game theory '  @xcite .    to introduce evolutionary game theory , consider a game in which all players share the same space of possible strategies , and there is an additional space of possible ` attribute vectors ' that characterize an agent , along with a probability distribution @xmath14 across that new space .",
    "( examples of attributes in the physical world could be things like size , speed , etc . )",
    "we select a set of agents to play a game by randomly sampling @xmath14 .",
    "those agents attribute vectors jointly determine the payoff matrices of each of the individual agents .",
    "( intuitively , what benefit accrues to an agent for taking a particular action depends on its attributes and those of the other agents . )",
    "however each agent @xmath4 has limited information concerning both its attribute vector and that of the other players in the game , information encapsulated in an ` information structure ' .",
    "the information structure specifies how much each agent knows concerning the game it is playing .    in this context , we enlarge the meaning of the term `` strategy '' to not just be a mapping from information sets and the like to actions , but from entire information structures to actions .",
    "in addition to the distribution @xmath14 over attribute vectors , we also have a distribution over strategies , @xmath15 . a strategy",
    "@xmath16 is a ` population strategy ' if @xmath15 is a delta function about @xmath16 .",
    "intuitively , we have a population strategy when each animal in a population `` follows the same behavioral rules '' , rules that take as input what the animal is able to discern about its strengths and weakness relative to those other members of the population , and produce as output how the animal will act in the presence of such animals .    given @xmath14 , a population strategy centered about @xmath16 , and its own attribute vector , any player @xmath4 in the support of @xmath14 has an expected payoff for any strategy it might adopt .",
    "when @xmath4 s payoff could not improve if it were to adopt any strategy other than @xmath16 , we say that @xmath16 is ` evolutionary stable ' .",
    "intuitively , an evolutionary stable strategy is one that is stable with respect to the introduction of mutants into the population .",
    "now consider a sequence of such evolutionary games .",
    "interpret the payoff that any agent receives after being involved in such a game as the ` reproductive fitness ' of that agent , in the biological sense .",
    "so the higher the payoff the agent receives , in comparison to the fitnesses of the other agents , the more `` offspring '' it has that get propagated to the next game . in the continuum - time limit , where games are indexed by the real number @xmath17 ,",
    "this can be formalized by a differential equation .",
    "this equation specifies the derivative of @xmath18 evaluated for each agent @xmath4 s attribute vector , as a montonically increasing function of the relative difference between the payoff of @xmath4 and the average payoff of all the agents .",
    "( we also have such an equation for @xmath15 . )",
    "the resulting dynamics is known as ` replicator dynamics ' , with an evolutionary stable population strategy , if it exists , being one particular fixed point of the dynamics .",
    "now consider removing the reproductive aspect of evolutionary game theory , and instead have each agent propagate to the next game , with `` memory '' of the events of the preceding game .",
    "furthermore , allow each agent to modify its strategy from one game to the next by `` learning '' from its memory of past games , in a bounded rational manner .",
    "the field of learning in games is concerned with exactly such situations  @xcite .",
    "most of the formal work in this field involves simple models for the learning process of the agents .",
    "for example , in ` ficticious play ' @xcite , in each successive game , each agent @xmath4 adopts what would be its best strategy if its opponents chose their strategies according to the empirical frequency distribution of such strategies that @xmath4 has encountered in the past .",
    "more sophisticated versions of this work employ simple bayesian learning algorithms , or re - inventions of some of the techniques of the rl community  @xcite .",
    "typically in learning in games one defines a payoff to the agent for a sequence of games , for example as a discounted sum of the payoffs in each of the constituent games . within this framework one can study the long term effects of strategies such as cooperation and see if they arise naturally and if so , under what circumstances .",
    "many aspects of real world games that do not occur very naturally otherwise arise spontaneously in these kinds of games .",
    "for example , when the number of games to be played is not pre - fixed , it may behoove a particular agent @xmath4 to treat its opponent better than it would otherwise , since @xmath4 @xmath19 have to rely on that other agent s treating it well in the future , if they end up playing each other again .",
    "this framework also allows us to investigate the dependence of evolving strategies on the amount of information available to the agents  @xcite ; the effect of communication on the evolution of cooperation  @xcite ; and the parallels between auctions and economic theory  @xcite .    in many respects , learning in games",
    "is even more relevant to the study of coins than is traditional game theory .",
    "however it suffers from the same major shortcoming ; it is almost exclusively focused on the forward problem rather than the inverse problem .",
    "in essence , coin design is the problem of @xmath20 game theory .",
    "the `` el farol '' bar problem and its variants provide a clean and simple testbed for investigating certain kinds of interactions among agents  @xcite . in the original version of the problem , which arose in economics , at each time step ( each `` night '' ) , each agent needs to decide whether to attend a particular bar .",
    "the goal of the agent in making this decision depends on the total attendance at the bar on that night .",
    "if the total attendance is below a preset capacity then the agent should have attended .",
    "conversely , if the bar is overcrowded on the given night , then the agent should not attend .",
    "( because of this structure , the bar problem with capacity set to @xmath21 of the total number of agents is also known as the ` minority game ' ; each agent selects one of two groups at each time step , and those that are in the minority have made the right choice ) .",
    "the agents make their choices by predicting ahead of time whether the attendance on the current night will exceed the capacity and then taking the appropriate course of action .",
    "what makes this problem particularly interesting is that it is impossible for each agent to be perfectly `` rational '' , in the sense of correctly predicting the attendance on any given night .",
    "this is because if most agents predict that the attendance will be low ( and therefore decide to attend ) , the attendance will actually high , while if they predict the attendance will be high ( and therefore decide not to attend ) the attendance will be low .",
    "( in the language of game theory , this essentially amounts to the property that there are no pure strategy nash equilibria  @xcite . ) alternatively , viewing the overall system as a coin , it has a prisoner s dilemma - like nature , in that `` rational '' behavior by all the individual agents thwarts the global goal of maximizing total enjoyment ( defined as the sum of all agents enjoyment and maximized when the bar is exactly at capacity ) .",
    "this frustration effect is similar to what occurs in spin glasses in physics , and makes the bar problem closely related to the physics of emergent behavior in distributed systems  @xcite .",
    "researchers have also studied the dynamics of the bar problem to investigate economic properties like competition , cooperation and collective behavior and especially their relationship to market efficiency  @xcite .      properly speaking , biological systems do not involve utility functions and searches across them with rl algorithms .",
    "however it has long been appreciated that there are many ways in which viewing biological systems as involving searches over such functions can lead to deeper understanding of them  @xcite .",
    "conversely , some have argued that the mechanism underlying biological systems can be used to help design search algorithms  @xcite .",
    "these kinds of reasoning which relate utility functions and biological systems have traditionally focussed on the case of a single biological system operating in some external environment .",
    "if we extend this kind of reasoning , to a set of biological systems that are co - evolving with one another , then we have essentially arrived at biologically - based coins .",
    "this section discusses some of how previous work in the literature bears on this relationship between coins and biology .",
    "the fields of population biology and ecological modeling are concerned with the large - scale `` emergent '' processes that govern the systems that consist of many ( relatively ) simple entities interacting with one another  @xcite . as usually cast , the `` simple entities '' are members of one or more species , and the interactions are some mathematical abstraction of the process of natural selection as it occurs in biological systems ( involving processes like genetic reproduction of various sorts , genotype - phenotype mappings , inter and intra - species competitions for resources , etc . ) .",
    "population biology and ecological modeling in this context addresses questions concerning the dynamics of the resultant ecosystem , and in particular how its long - term behavior depends on the details of the interactions between the constituent entities .",
    "broadly construed , the paradigm of ecological modeling can even be broadened to study how natural selection and self - regulating feedback creates a stable planet - wide ecological environment ",
    "gaia  @xcite .",
    "the underlying mathematical models of other fields can often be usefully modified to apply to the kinds of systems population biology is interested in  @xcite .",
    "( see also the discussion in the game theory subsection above . )",
    "conversely , the underlying mathematical models of population biology and ecological modeling can be applied to other non - biological systems . in particular , those models shed light on social issues such as the emergence of language or culture , warfare , and economic competition  @xcite .",
    "they also can be used to investigate more abstract issues concerning the behavior of large complex systems with many interacting components  @xcite .",
    "going a bit further afield , an approach that is related in spirit to ecological modeling is ` computational ecologies ' .",
    "these are large distributed systems where each component of the system s acting ( seemingly ) independently results in complex global behavior .",
    "those components are viewed as constituting an `` ecology '' in an abstract sense ( although much of the mathematics is not derived from the traditional field of ecological modeling ) . in particular",
    ", one can investigate how the dynamics of the ecology is influenced by the information available to each component and how cooperation and communication among the components affects that dynamics  @xcite .",
    "although in some ways the most closely related to coins of the current ecology - inspired research , the field of computational ecologies has some significant shortcomings if one tries to view it as a full science of coins .",
    "in particular , it suffers from not being designed to solve the inverse problem of how to configure the system so as to arrive at a particular desired dynamics .",
    "this is a difficulty endemic to the general program of equating ecological modeling and population biology with the science of coins .",
    "these fields are primarily concerned with the `` forward problem '' of determining the dynamics that arises from certain choices of the underlying system .",
    "unless one s desired dynamics is sufficiently close to some dynamics that was previously catalogued ( during one s investigation of the forward problem ) , one has very little information on how to set up the components and their interactions to achieve that desired dynamics .",
    "in addition , most of the work in these fields does not involve rl algorithms , and viewed as a context in which to design coins suffers from a need for hand - tailoring , and potentially lack of robustness and scalability .",
    "the field of ` swarm intelligence ' is concerned with systems that are modeled after social insect colonies , so that the different components of the system are queen , worker , soldier , etc .",
    "it can be viewed as ecological modeling in which the individual entities have extremely limited computing capacity and/or action sets , and in which there are very few types of entities .",
    "the premise of the field is that the rich behavior of social insect colonies arises not from the sophistication of any individual entity in the colony , but from the interaction among those entities .",
    "the objective of current research is to uncover kinds of interactions among the entity types that lead to pre - specified behavior of some sort .",
    "more speculatively , the study of social insect colonies may also provide insight into how to achieve learning in large distributed systems .",
    "this is because at the level of the individual insect in a colony , very little ( or no ) learning takes place .",
    "however across evolutionary time - scales the social insect species as a whole functions as if the various individual types in a colony had `` learned '' their specific functions .",
    "the `` learning '' is the direct result of natural selection .",
    "( see the discussion on this topic in the subsection on ecological modeling . )",
    "swarm intelligences have been used to adaptively allocate tasks in a mail company  @xcite , solve the traveling salesman problem  @xcite and route data efficiently in dynamic networks  @xcite among others . despite this",
    ", such intelligences do not really constitute a general approach to designing coins .",
    "there is no general framework for adapting swarm intelligences to maximize particular world utility functions .",
    "accordingly , such intelligences generally need to be hand - tailored for each application . and after such tailoring , it is often quite a stretch to view the system as `` biological '' in any sense , rather than just a simple and _ a priori _ reasonable modification of some previously deployed system .",
    "the two main objectives of artificial life , closely related to one another , are understanding the abstract functioning and especially the origin of terrestrial life , and creating organisms that can meaningfully be called `` alive ''  @xcite .",
    "the first objective involves formalizing and abstracting the mechanical processes underpinning terrestrial life . in particular ,",
    "much of this work involves various degrees of abstraction of the process of self - replication  @xcite .",
    "some of the more real - world - oriented work on this topic involves investigating how lipids assemble into more complex structures such as vesicles and membranes , which is one of the fundamental questions concerning the origin of life  @xcite .",
    "many computer models have been proposed to simulate this process , though most suffer from overly simplifying the molecular morphology .",
    "more generally , work concerned with the origin of life can constitute an investigation of the functional self - organization that gives rise to life  @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "an important early work on functional self - organization is the _ lambda calculus _ , which provides an elegant framework ( recursively defined functions , lack of distinction between object and function , lack of architectural restrictions ) for studying computational systems  @xcite .",
    "this framework can be used to develop an artificial chemistry `` function gas '' that displays complex cooperative properties  @xcite .",
    "the second objective of the field of artificial life is less concerned with understanding the details of terrestrial life per se than of using terrestrial life as inspiration for how to design living systems .",
    "for example , motivated by the existence ( and persistence ) of computer viruses , several workers have tried to design an immune system for computers that will develop `` antibodies '' and handle viruses both more rapidly and more efficiently than other algorithms  @xcite .",
    "more generally , because we only have one sampling point ( life on earth ) , it is very difficult to precisely formulate the process by which life emerged . by creating an artificial world inside a computer however , it is possible to study far more general forms of life  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite where the argument is presented that the richest way of approaching the issue of defining `` life '' is phenomenologically , in terms of self-@xmath22similar scaling properties of the system .",
    "cellular automata can be viewed as digital abstractions of physical gases  @xcite .",
    "formally , they are discrete - time recurrent neural nets where the neurons live on a grid , each neuron has a finite number of potential states , and inter - neuron connections are ( usually ) purely local .",
    "( see below for a discussion of recurrent neural nets . )",
    "so the state update rule of each neuron is fixed and local , the next state of a neuron being a function of the current states of it and of its neighboring elements .",
    "the state update rule of ( all the neurons making up ) any particular cellular automaton specifies the mapping taking the initial configuration of the states of all of its neurons to the final , equilibrium ( perhaps strange ) attractor configuration of all those neurons .",
    "so consider the situation where we have a desired such mapping , and want to know an update rule that induces that mapping .",
    "this is a search problem , and can be viewed as similar to the inverse problem of how to design a coin to achieve a pre - specified global goal , albeit a `` coin '' whose nodal elements do not use rl algorithms .",
    "genetic algorithms are a special kind of search algorithm , based on analogy with the biological process of natural selection via recombination and mutation of a genome  @xcite .",
    "although genetic algorithms ( and ` evolutionary computation ' in general ) have been studied quite extensively , there is no formal theory justifying genetic algorithms as search algorithms @xcite and few empirical comparisons with other search techniques .",
    "one example of a well - studied application of genetic algorithms is to ( try to ) solve the inverse problem of finding update rules for a cellular automaton that induce a pre - specified mapping from its initial configuration to its attractor configuration . to date",
    ", they have used this way only for extremely simple configuration mappings , mappings which can be trivially learned by other kinds of systems . despite the simplicity of these mappings ,",
    "the use of genetic algorithms to try to train cellular automata to exhibit them has achieved little success  @xcite .",
    "equilibrium statistical physics is concerned with the stable state character of large numbers of very simple physical objects , interacting according to well - specified local deterministic laws , with probabilistic noise processes superimposed  @xcite .",
    "typically there is no sense in which such systems can be said to have centralized control , since all particles contribute comparably to the overall dynamics .    aside from mesoscopic statistical physics ,",
    "the numbers of particles considered are usually huge ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath23 ) , and the particles themselves are extraordinarily simple , typically having only a few degrees of freedom . moreover , the noise processes usually considered are highly restricted , being those that are formed by `` baths '' , of heat , particles , and the like .",
    "similarly , almost all of the field restricts itself to deterministic laws that are readily encapsulated in hamilton s equations ( schrodinger s equation and its field - theoretic variants for quantum statistical physics ) .",
    "in fact , much of equilibrium statistical physics is nt even concerned with the dynamic laws by themselves ( as for example is stochastic markov processes ) .",
    "rather it is concerned with invariants of those laws ( _ e.g. _ , energy ) , invariants that relate the states of all of the particles . trivially then",
    ", deterministic laws without such readily - discoverable invariants are outside of the purview of much of statistical physics .",
    "one potential use of statistical physics for coins involves taking the systems that statistical physics analyzes , especially those analyzed in its condensed matter variant ( _ e.g. _ , spin glasses @xcite ) , as simplified models of a class of coins .",
    "this approach is used in some of the analysis of the bar problem ( see above ) .",
    "it is used more overtly in ( for example ) the work of galam @xcite , in which the equilibrium coalitions of a set of `` countries '' are modeled in terms of spin glasses .",
    "this approach can not provide a general coin framework though .",
    "in addition to the restrictions listed above on the kinds of systems it considers , this is due to its not providing a general solution to arbitrary coin inversion problems , and to its not employing rl algorithms .",
    "another contribution that statistical physics can make is with the mathematical techniques it has developed for its own purposes , like mean field theory , self - averaging approximations , phase transitions , monte carlo techniques , the replica trick , and tools to analyze the thermodynamic limit in which the number of particles goes to infinity .",
    "although such techniques have not yet been applied to coins , they have been successfully applied to related fields .",
    "this is exemplified by the use of the replica trick to analyze two - player zero - sum games with random payoff matrices in the thermodynamic limit of the number of strategies in @xcite .",
    "other examples are the numeric investigation of iterated prisoner s dilemma played on a lattice @xcite , the analysis of stochastic games by expressing of deviation from rationality in the form of a `` heat bath '' @xcite , and the use of topological entropy to quantify the complexity of a voting system studied in @xcite .",
    "other quite recent work in the statistical physics literature is formally identical to that in other fields , but presents it from a novel perspective .",

    "the calculus of variations can be used to solve for the worldline of a dynamic system . as an example",
    ", simple newtonian dynamics can be cast as solving for the worldline of the system that extremizes a quantity called the ` lagrangian ' , which is a function of that worldline and of certain parameters ( _ e.g. _ , the ` potential energy ' ) governing the system at hand . in this instance , the calculus of variations simply results in newton s laws .",
    "if we take the dynamic system to be a coin , we are assured that its worldline automatically optimizes a `` global goal '' consisting of the value of the associated actional .",
    "if we change physical aspects of the system that determine the functional form of the actional ( _ e.g. _ , change the system s potential energy function ) , then we change the global goal , and we are assured that our coin optimizes that new global goal . counter - intuitive physical systems , like those that exhibit braess paradox  @xcite , are simply systems for which the `` world utility '' implicit in our human intuition is extremized at a point different from the one that extremizes the system s actional .",
    "the challenge in exploiting this to solve the coin design problem is in translating an arbitrary provided global goal for the coin into a parameterized actional . note that that actional must govern the dynamics of the physical coin , and the parameters of the actional must be physical variables in the coin , variables whose values we can modify .      the field of active walker models @xcite is concerned with modeling `` walkers '' ( be they human walkers or instead simple physical objects ) crossing fields along trajectories , where those trajectories are a function of several factors , including in particular the trails already worn into the field .",
    "often the kind of trajectories considered are those that can be cast as solutions to actional extremization problems so that the walkers can be explicitly viewed as agents optimizing a private utility .",
    "one of the primary concerns with the field of active walker models is how the trails worn in the field change with time to reach a final equilibrium state .",
    "the problem of how to design the cement pathways in the field ( and other physical features of the field ) so that the final paths actually followed by the walkers will have certain desirable characteristics is then one of solving for parameters of the actional that will result in the desired worldline .",
    "this is a special instance of the inverse problem of how to design a coin .    using active walker models this way to design coins , like action extremization in general , probably has limited applicability . also , it is not clear how robust such a design approach might be , or whether it would be scalable and exempt from the need for hand - tailoring .",
    "this subsection presents a `` catch - all '' of other fields that have little in common with one another except that they bear some relation to coins .",
    "an extremely well - researched body of work concerns the mathematical and numeric behavior of systems for which the probability distribution over possible future states conditioned on preceding states is explicitly provided .",
    "this work involves many aspects of monte carlo numerical algorithms  @xcite , all of markov chains @xcite , and especially markov fields , a topic that encompasses the chapman - kolmogorov equations  @xcite and its variants : liouville s equation , the fokker - plank equation , and the detailed - balance equation in particular .",
    "non - linear dynamics is also related to this body of work ( see the synopsis of iterated function systems below and the synopsis of cellular automata above ) , as is markov competitive decision processes ( see the synopsis of game theory above ) .",
    "formally , one can cast the problem of designing a coin as how to fix each of the conditional transition probability distributions of the individual elements of a stochastic field so that the aggregate behavior of the overall system is of a desired form . unfortunately , almost all that is known in this area instead concerns the forward problem , of inferring aggregate behavior from a provided set of conditional distributions .",
    "although such knowledge provides many `` bits and pieces '' of information about how to tackle the inverse problem , those pieces collectively cover only a very small subset of the entire space of tasks we might want the coin to perform . in particular ,",
    "they tell us very little about the case where the conditional distribution encapsulates rl algorithms .",
    "the technique of iterated function systems  @xcite grew out of the field of nonlinear dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in such systems a function is repeatedly and recursively applied to itself .",
    "the most famous example is the logistic map , @xmath24 for some @xmath25 between 0 and 4 ( so that @xmath26 stays between 0 and 1 ) . more generally the function along with its arguments can be vector - valued . in particular , we can construct such functions out of affine transformations of points in a euclidean plane .",
    "iterated functions systems have been applied to image data . in this case",
    "the successive iteration of the function generically generates a fractal , one whose precise character is determined by the initial iteration-1 image . since fractals are ubiquitous in natural images , a natural idea is to try to encode natural images as sets of iterated function systems spread across the plane , thereby potentially garnering significant image compression .",
    "the trick is to manage the inverse step of starting with the image to be compressed , and determining what iteration-1 image(s ) and iterating function(s ) will generate an accurate approximation of that image .    in the language of nonlinear dynamics , we have a dynamic system that consists of a set of iterating functions , together with a desired attractor ( the image to be compressed ) .",
    "our goal is to determine what values to set certain parameters of our dynamic system to so that the system will have that desired attractor .",
    "the potential relationship with coins arises from this inverse nature of the problem tackled by iterated function systems .",
    "if the goal for a coin can be cast as its relaxing to a particular attractor , and if the distributed computational elements are isomorphic to iterated functions , then the tricks used in iterated functions theory could be of use .",
    "although the techniques of iterated function systems might prove of use in designing coins , they are unlikely to serve as a generally applicable approach to designing coins . in addition , they do not involve rl algorithms , and often involve extensive hand - tuning .",
    "a recurrent neural net consists of a finite set of `` neurons '' each of which has a real - valued state at each moment in time .",
    "each neuron s state is updated at each moment in time based on its current state and that of some of the other neurons in the system .",
    "the topology of such dependencies constitute the `` inter - neuronal connections '' of the net , and the associated parameters are often called the `` weights '' of the net",
    ". the dynamics can be either discrete or continuous ( _ i.e. _ , given by difference or differential equations ) .",
    "recurrent nets have been investigated for many purposes  @xcite .",
    "one of the more famous of these is associative memories .",
    "the idea is that given a pre - specified pattern for the ( states of the neurons in the ) net , there may exist inter - neuronal weights which result in a basin of attraction focussed on that pattern . if this is the case , then the net is equivalent to an associative memory , in that a complete pre - specified pattern across all neurons will emerge under the net s dynamics from any initial pattern that partially matches the full pre - specified pattern . in practice ,",
    "one wishes the net to simultaneously possess many such pre - specified associative memories .",
    "there are many schemes for `` training '' a recurrent net to have this property , including schemes based on spin glasses @xcite and schemes based on gradient descent @xcite .",
    "as can the fields of cellular automata and iterated function systems , the field of recurrent neural nets can be viewed as concerning certain variants of coins . also like those other fields though , recurrent neural nets has shortcomings if one tries to view it as a general approach to a science of coins .",
    "in particular , recurrent neural nets do not involve rl algorithms , and training them often suffers from scaling problems .",
    "more generally , in practice they can be hard to train well without hand - tailoring .",
    "packet routing in a data network  @xcite presents a particularly interesting domain for the investigation of coins . in particular , with such routing : + ( i ) the problem is inherently distributed ; + ( ii ) for all but the most trivial networks it is impossible to employ global control ; + ( iii ) the routers have only access to local information ( routing tables ) ; + ( iv ) it constitutes a relatively clean and easily modified experimental testbed ; and + ( v ) there are potentially major bottlenecks induced by ` greedy ' behavior on the part of the individual routers , which behavior constitutes a readily investigated instance of the tragedy of the commons ( toc ) .    many of the approaches to packet routing incorporate a variant on rl  @xcite .",
    "q  routing is perhaps the best known such approach and is based on routers using reinforcement learning to select the best path  @xcite .",
    "although generally successful , q  routing is not a general scheme for inverting a global task .",
    "this is even true if one restricts attention to the problem of routing in data networks  there exists a global task in such problems , but that task is directly used to construct the algorithm .",
    "a particular version of the general packet routing problem that is acquiring increased attention is the quality of service ( qos ) problem , where different communication packets ( voice , video , data ) share the same bandwidth resource but have widely varying importances both to the user and ( via revenue ) to the bandwidth provider . determining which packet has precedence over which other packets in such cases",
    "is not only based on priority in arrival time but more generally on the potential effects on the income of the bandwidth provider . in this context ,",
    "rl algorithms have been used to determine routing policy , control call admission and maximize revenue by allocating the available bandwidth efficiently  @xcite .",
    "many researchers have exploited the noncooperative game theoretic understanding of the toc in order to explain the bottleneck character of empirical data networks behavior and suggest potential alternatives to current routing schemes  @xcite .",
    "closely related is work on various `` pricing''-based resource allocation strategies in congestable data networks  @xcite .",
    "this work is at least partially based upon current understanding of pricing in toll lanes , and traffic flow in general ( see below ) .",
    "all of these approaches are particularly of interest when combined with the rl - based schemes mentioned just above . due to these factors ,",
    "much of the current research on a general framework for coins is directed toward the packet - routing domain ( see next section ) .",
    "traffic congestion typifies the toc public good problem : everyone wants to use the same resource , and all parties greedily trying to optimize their use of that resource not only worsens global behavior , but also worsens _ their own _ private utility ( _ e.g. _ , if everyone disobeys traffic lights , everyone gets stuck in traffic jams ) . indeed , in the well - known braess paradox  @xcite , keeping everything else constant",
    " including the number and destinations of the drivers  but opening a new traffic path can _ increase _ everyone s time to get to their destination .",
    "( viewing the overall system as an instance of the prisoner s dilemma , this paradox in essence arises through the creation of a novel ` defect - defect ' option for the overall system .",
    ") greedy behavior on the part of individuals also results in very rich global dynamic patterns , such as stop and go waves and clusters  @xcite .",
    "much of traffic theory employs and investigates tools that have previously been applied in statistical physics  @xcite ( see subsection above ) .",
    "in particular , the spontaneous formation of traffic jams provides a rich testbed for studying the emergence of complex activity from seemingly chaotic states  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics of traffic flow is particular amenable to the application and testing of many novel numerical methods in a controlled environment  @xcite .",
    "many experimental studies have confirmed the usefulness of applying insights gleaned from such work to real world traffic scenarios  @xcite .",
    "finally , there are a number of other fields that , while either still nascent or not extremely closely related to coins , are of interest in coin design :    * amorphous computing : * amorphous computing grew out of the idea of replacing traditional computer design , with its requirements for high reliability of the components of the computer , with a novel approach in which widespread unreliability of those components would not interfere with the computation  @xcite .",
    "some of its more speculative aspects are concerned with `` how to program '' a massively distributed , noisy system of components which may consist in part of biochemical and/or biomechanical components  @xcite .",
    "work here has tended to focus on schemes for how to robustly induce desired geometric dynamics across the physical body of the amorphous computer  issue that are closely related to morphogenesis , and thereby lend credence to the idea that biochemical components are a promising approach . especially in its limit of computers with very small constituent components , amorphous computing also is closely related to the fields of nanotechnology  @xcite and control of smart matter ( see below ) .",
    "* control of smart matter:*. as the prospect of nanotechnology - driven mechanical systems gets more concrete , the daunting problem of how to robustly control , power , and sustain protean systems made up of extremely large sets of nano - scale devices looms more important  @xcite .",
    "if this problem were to be solved one would in essence have `` smart matter '' .",
    "for example , one would be able to `` paint '' an airplane wing with such matter and have it improve drag and lift properties significantly .    * morphogenesis : * how does a leopard embryo get its spots , or a zebra embryo its stripes ? more generally , what are the processes underlying morphogenesis , in which a body plan develops among a growing set of initially undifferentiated cells ?",
    "these questions , related to control of the dynamics of chemical reaction waves , are essentially special cases of the more general question of how ontogeny works , of how the genotype - phenotype mapping is carried out in development .",
    "the answers involve homeobox ( as well as many other ) genes  @xcite . under the presumption that the functioning of such genes is at least in part designed to facilitate genetic changes that increase a species fitness , that functioning facilitates solution of the inverse problem , of finding small - scale changes ( to dna ) that will result in `` desired '' large scale effects ( to body plan ) when propagated across a growing distributed system .",
    "* self organizing systems * the concept of self - organization and self - organized criticality  @xcite was originally developed to help understand why many distributed physical systems are attracted to critical states that possess long - range dynamic correlations in the large - scale characteristics of the system .",
    "it provides a powerful framework for analyzing both biological and economic systems .",
    "for example , natural selection ( particularly punctuated equilibrium  @xcite ) can be likened to self - organizing dynamical system , and some have argued it shares many the properties ( _ e.g. _ , scale invariance ) of such systems @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can view the economic order that results from the actions of human agents as a case of self - organization  @xcite .",
    "the relationship between complexity and self - organization is a particularly important one , in that it provides the potential laws that allow order to arise from chaos  @xcite .    * small worlds ( 6 degrees of separation ) : * in many distributed systems where each component can interact with a small number of `` neighbors '' ,",
    "an important problem is how to propagate information across the system quickly and with minimal overhead . on the one extreme",
    "the neighborhood topology of such systems can exist on a completely regular grid - like structure . on the other",
    ", the topology can be totally random . in either case",
    ", certain nodes may be effectively ` cut - off ' from other nodes if the information pathways between them are too long .",
    "recent work has investigated `` small worlds '' networks ( sometimes called 6 degrees of separation ) in which underlying grid - like topologies are `` doped '' with a scattering of long - range , random connections .",
    "it turns out that very little such doping is necessary to allow for the system to effectively circumvent the information propagation problem  @xcite .",
    "* control theory : * adaptive control  @xcite , and in particular adaptive control involving locally weighted rl algorithms  @xcite , constitute a broadly applicable framework for controlling small , potentially inexactly modeled systems .",
    "augmented by techniques in the control of chaotic systems  @xcite , they constitute a very successful way of solving the `` inverse problem '' for such systems .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear how one could even attempt to scale such techniques up to the massively distributed systems of interest in coins .",
    "the next section discusses in detail some of the underlying reasons why the purely model - based versions of these approaches are inappropriate as a framework for coins .",
    "summarizing the discussion to this point , it is hard to see how any already extant scientific field can be modified to encompass systems meeting all of the requirements of coins listed at the beginning of section  [ sec : lit ] .",
    "this is not too surprising , since none of those fields were explicitly designed to analyze coins .",
    "this section first motivates in general terms a framework that is explicitly designed for analyzing coins .",
    "it then presents the formal nomenclature of that framework .",
    "this is followed by derivations of some of the central theorems of that framework .",
    "finally , we present experiments that illustrate the power the framework provides for ensuring large world utility in a coin .",
    "what mathematics might one employ to understand and design coins ?",
    "perhaps the most natural approach , related to the stochastic fields work reviewed above , involves the following three steps :    \\1 ) first one constructs a detailed stochastic model of the coin s dynamics , a model parameterized by a vector @xmath27 .",
    "as an example , @xmath27 could fix the utility functions of the individual agents of the coin , aspects of their rl algorithms , which agents communicate with each other and how , etc .",
    "\\2 ) next we solve for the function @xmath28 which maps the parameters of the model to the resulting stochastic dynamics .",
    "\\3 ) cast our goal for the system as a whole as achieving a high expected value of some `` world utility '' .",
    "then as our final step we would have to solve the inverse problem : we would have to search for a @xmath27 which , via @xmath9 , results in a high value of e(world utility @xmath29 ) .",
    "let s examine in turn some of the challenges each of these three steps entrain :    \\i ) we are primarily interested in very large , very complex systems , which are noisy , faulty , and often operate in a non - stationary environment .",
    "moreover , our `` very complex system '' consists of many rl algorithms , all potentially quite complicated , all running simultaneously . clearly coming up with a detailed model that captures the dynamics of all of this in an accurate manner will often be extraordinarily difficult .",
    "moreover , unfortunately , given that the modeling is highly detailed , often the level of verisimilitude required of the model will be quite high .",
    "for example , unless the modeling of the faulty aspects of the system were quite accurate , the model would likely be `` brittle '' , and overly sensitive to which elements of the coin were and were not operating properly at any given time .",
    "\\ii ) even for models much simpler than the ones called for in ( i ) , solving explicitly for the function @xmath9 can be extremely difficult .",
    "for example , much of markov chain theory is an attempt to broadly characterize such mappings .",
    "however as a practical matter , usually it can only produce potentially useful characterizations when the underlying models are quite inaccurate simplifications of the kinds of models produced in step ( i ) .",
    "\\iii ) even if one can write down an @xmath9 , solving the associated inverse problem is often impossible in practice .",
    "\\iv ) in addition to these difficulties , there is a more general problem with the model - based approach .",
    "we wish to perform our analysis on a `` high level '' .",
    "our thesis is that due to the robust and adaptive nature of the individual agents rl algorithms , there will be very broad , easily identifiable regions of @xmath27 space all of which result in excellent e(world utility @xmath29 ) , and that these regions will not depend on the precise learning algorithms used to achieve the low - level tasks ( cf . the list at the beginning of section  [ sec : lit ] ) . to fully capitalize on this",
    ", one would want to be able to slot in and out different learning algorithms for achieving the low - level tasks without having to redo our entire analysis each time .",
    "however in general this would be possible with a model - based analysis only for very carefully designed models ( if at all ) .",
    "the problem is that the result of step ( 3 ) , the solution to the inverse problem , would have to concern aspects of the coin that are ( at least approximately ) invariant with respect to the precise low - level learning algorithms used . coming up with a model that has this property while still avoiding problems",
    "( i - iii ) is usually an extremely daunting challenge .",
    "fortunately , there is an alternative approach which avoids the difficulties of detailed modeling .",
    "little modeling of any sort ever is used in this alternative , and what modeling does arise has little to do with dynamics .",
    "in addition , any such modeling is extremely high - level , intented to serve as a decent approximation to almost any system having `` reasonable '' rl algorithms , rather than as an accurate model of one particular system .",
    "we call any framework based on this alternative a * descriptive framework*. in such a framework one identifies certain * salient characteristics * of coins , which are characteristics of a coin s entire worldline that one strongly expects to find in coins that have large world utility . under this expectation ,",
    "one makes the assumption that if a coin is explicitly modified to have the salient characteristics ( for example in response to observations of its run - time behavior ) , then its world utility will benefit .",
    "so long as the salient characteristics are ( relatively ) easy to induce in a coin , then this assumption provides a ready indirect way to cause that coin to have large world utility .",
    "an assumption of this nature is the central leverage point that a descriptive framework employs to circumvent detailed modeling . under it , if the salient characteristics can be induced with little or no modeling ( e.g. , via heuristics that are nt rigorously and formally justified ) , then they provide an indirect way to improve world utility without recourse to detailed modeling .",
    "in fact , since one does not use detailed modeling in a descriptive framework , it may even be that one does not have a fully rigorous mathematical proof that the central assumption holds in a particular system for one s choice of salient characteristics .",
    "one may have to be content with reasonableness arguments not only to justify one s scheme for inducing the salient characteristics , but for making the assumption that characteristics are correlated with large world utility in the first place .",
    "of course , the trick in the descriptive framework is to choose salient characteristics that both have a beneficial relationship with world utility and that one expects to be able to induce with relatively little detailed modeling of the system s dynamics .",
    "there exist many ways one might try to design a descriptive framework . in this subsection we present nomenclature needed for a ( very ) cursory overview of one of them .",
    "( see @xcite for a more detailed exposition , including formal proofs . )",
    "this overview concentrates on the four salient characteristics of intelligence , learnability , factoredness , and the wonderful life utility , all defined below .",
    "intelligence is a quantification of how well an rl algorithm performs .",
    "we want to do whatever we can to help those algorithms achieve high values of their utility functions .",
    "learnability is a characteristic of a utility function that one would expect to be well - correlated with how well an rl algorithm can learn to optimize it . a utility function is also factored if whenever its value increases , the overall system benefits . finally , wonderful life utility is an example of a utility function that is both learnable and factored .",
    "after the preliminary definitions below , this section formalizes these four salient characteristics , derives several theorems relating them , and illustrates in some computer experiments how those theorems can be used to help the system achieve high world utility .",
    "* 1 ) * we refer to an rl algorithm by which an individual component of the coin modifies its behavior as a * microlearning * algorithm .",
    "we refer to the initial construction of the coin , potentially based upon salient characteristics , as the coin * initialization*. we use the phrase * macrolearning * to refer to externally imposed run - time modifications to the coin which are based on statistical inference concerning salient characteristics of the running coin .",
    "* 2 ) * for convenience , we take time , @xmath17 , to be discrete and confined to the integers , _ z_. when referring to coin initialization , we implicitly have a lower bound on @xmath17 , which without loss of generality we take to be less than or equal to @xmath30 .    *",
    "3 ) * all variables that have any effect on the coin are identified as components of euclidean - vector - valued * states * of various discrete * nodes*. as an important example , if our coin consists in part of a computational `` agent '' running a microlearning algorithm , the precise configuration of that agent at any time @xmath17 , including all variables in its learning algorithm , all actions directly visible to the outside world , all internal parameters , all values observed by its probes of the surrounding environment , etc . ,",
    "all constitute the state vector of a node representing that agent .",
    "we define @xmath31 to be a vector in the euclidean vector space @xmath32 , where the components of @xmath31 give the state of node @xmath33 at time @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath4th component of that vector is indicated by @xmath34 .",
    "* observation 3.1 : * in practice , many coins will involve variables that are most naturally viewed as discrete and symbolic . in such cases , we must exercise some care in how we choose to represent those variables as components of euclidean vectors .",
    "there is nothing new in this ; the same issue arises in modern work on applying neural nets to inherently symbolic problems . in our coin framework",
    ", we will usually employ the same resolution of this issue employed in neural nets , namely representing the possible values of the discrete variable with a unary representation in a euclidean space .",
    "just as with neural nets , values of such vectors that do not lie on the vertices of the unit hypercube are not meaningful , strictly speaking .",
    "fortunately though , just as with neural nets , there is almost always a most natural way to extend the definitions of any function of interest ( like world utility ) so that it is well - defined even for vectors not lying on those vertices .",
    "this allows us to meaningfully define partial derivatives of such functions with respect to the components of @xmath35 , partial derivatives that we will evaluate at the corners of the unit hypercube .",
    "* 4 ) * for notational convenience , we define @xmath36 to be the vector of the states of all nodes at time @xmath17 ; @xmath37 to be the vector of the states of all nodes other than @xmath33 at time @xmath17 ; and @xmath38 to be the entire vector of the states of all nodes at all times .",
    "@xmath39 is infinite - dimensional in general , and usually assumed to be a hilbert space .",
    "we will often assume that all spaces @xmath40 over all times @xmath17 are isomorphic to a space @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath39 is a cartesian product of copies of @xmath41 .    also for notational convenience , we define gradients using @xmath42-shorthand .",
    "so for example , @xmath43 is the vector of the partial derivative of @xmath44 with respect to the components of @xmath45 .",
    "also , we will sometimes treat the symbol `` @xmath17 '' specially , as delineating a range of components of @xmath35 .",
    "so for example an expression like `` @xmath46 '' refers to all components @xmath45 with @xmath47 .    * 5 ) * to avoid confusion with the other uses of the comma operator",
    ", we will often use @xmath48 rather than @xmath49 to indicate the vector formed by concatenating the two ordered sets of vector components @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "for example , @xmath52 refers to the vector formed by concatenating those components of the worldline @xmath35 involving node @xmath33 for times less than 0 with those components involving node @xmath53 that have times greater than 0 .    *",
    "6 ) * we take the universe in which our coin operates to be completely deterministic .",
    "this is certainly the case for any coin that operates in a digital system , even a system that emulates analog and/or stochastic processes ( _ e.g. _ , with a pseudo - random number generator ) . more generally , this determinism reflects the fact that since the real world obeys ( deterministic ) physics , @xmath54 real - world system , be it a coin or something else , is , ultimately , embedded in a deterministic system .",
    "the perspective to be kept in mind here is that of nonlinear time - series analysis .",
    "a physical time series typically reflects a few degrees of freedom that are projected out of the underlying space in which the full system is deterministically evolving , an underlying space that is actually extremely high - dimensional .",
    "this projection typically results in an illusion of stochasticity in the time series .    *",
    "7 ) * formally , to reflect this determinism , first we bundle all variables we are not directly considering  but which nonetheless affect the dynamics of the system  as components of some catch - all * environment node*. so for example any `` noise processes '' and the like affecting the coin s dynamics are taken to be inputs from a deterministic , very high - dimensional environment that is potentially chaotic and is never directly observed  @xcite .",
    "given such an environment node , we then stipulate that for all @xmath55 such that @xmath56 , @xmath45 sets @xmath57 uniquely .",
    "* observation 7.1 : * when nodes are `` computational devices '' , often we must be careful to specify the physical extent of those devices .",
    "such a node may just be the associated cpu , or it may be that cpu together with the main ram , or it may include an external storage device . almost always , the border of the device @xmath33 will end before any external system that @xmath33 is `` observing '' begins .",
    "this means that since at time @xmath17 @xmath33 only knows the value of @xmath31 , its `` observational knowledge '' of that external system is indirect .",
    "that knowledge reflects a coupling between @xmath31 and @xmath58 , a coupling that is induced by the dynamical evolution of the system from preceding moments up to the time @xmath17 .",
    "if the dynamics does not force such a coupling , then @xmath33 has no observational knowledge of the outside world .    *",
    "8) * we express the dynamics of our system by writing @xmath59 .",
    "( in this paper there will be no need to be more precise and specify the precise dependency of @xmath60 on @xmath17 and/or @xmath61 . )",
    "we define @xmath62 to be a set of constraint equations enforcing that dynamics , and also , more generally , fixing the entire manifold @xmath63 of vectors @xmath64 that we consider to be ` allowed ' .",
    "so @xmath63 is a subset of the set of all @xmath65 that are consistent with the deterministic laws governing the coin , _",
    "i.e. _ , that obey @xmath66 .",
    "we generalize this notation in the obvious way , so that ( for example ) @xmath67 is the manifold consisting of all vectors @xmath68 that are projections of a vector in @xmath63 .",
    "* observation 8.1 : * note that @xmath67 is parameterized by @xmath69 , due to determinism . note also that whereas @xmath60 is defined for any argument of the form @xmath70 for some @xmath17 ( _ i.e. _ , we can evolve any point forward in time ) , in general not all @xmath71 lie in @xmath72 .",
    "in particular , there may be extra restrictions constraining the possible states of the system beyond those arising from its need to obey the relevant dynamical laws of physics . finally , whenever trying to express a coin in terms of the framework presented here , it is a good rule to try to write out the constraint equations explicitly to check that what one has identified as the space @xmath40 contains all quantities needed to uniquely fix the future state of the system .    *",
    "observation 8.2 : * we do not want to have @xmath73 be the phase space of every particle in the system .",
    "we will instead usually have @xmath73 consist of variables that , although still evolving deterministically , exist at a larger scale of granularity than that of individual particles ( _ e.g. _ , thermodynamic variables in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "however we will often be concerned with physical systems obeying entropy - driven dynamic processes that are contractive at this high level of granularity .",

    "exactly as in statistical physics , a stochastic nature can be superimposed on our space of deterministic worldlines , potentially by adopting a degree of belief perspective on `` what probability means ''  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the macrolearning algorithms we investigate below implicitly involve such a superimposing ; they implicitly assume a probabilistic coupling between the ( statistical estimate of the ) correlation coefficient connecting the states of a pair of nodes and whether those nodes are in the one another s `` effect set '' .",
    "similarly , while it does not salient characteristics that involve probability distributions , the descriptive framework does not preclude such characteristics either . as an example , the `` intelligence '' of an agent s particular action , formally defined below , measures the fraction of alternative actions an agent could have taken that would have resulted in a lower utility value . to define such",
    "a fraction requires a measure across the space of such alternative actions , even if only implicitly .",

    "usually we will implicitly take @xmath63 to be the dynamics of the system , microlearning and all , _ for fixed private utilities _ that are specified in @xmath35 .",
    "for example , @xmath35 could contain , for each microlearner , the bits in an associated computer specifying the subroutine that that microlearner can call to evaluate what its private utility would be for some full worldline @xmath35 .",
    "macrolearning overrides @xmath63 , and in this situation it refers ( for example ) to any statistical inference process that modifies the private utilities at run - time to try to induce the desired salient characteristics .",
    "concretely , this would involve modifications to the bits \\{@xmath75 } specifying each microlearner @xmath4 s private utility , modifications that are @xmath74 accounted for in @xmath63 , and that are potentially based on variables that are not reflected in @xmath39 . since @xmath63 does not reflect such macrolearning , when trying to ascertain @xmath63 based on empirical observation ( as for example when determining how best to modify the private utilities ) , we have to take care to distinguish which part of the system s observed dynamics is due to @xmath63 and which part instead reflects externally imposed modifications to the private utilities .    more generally though , other boundaries between the coin and macrolearning - based perturbations to it are possible , reflecting other definitions of @xmath39 , and other interpretations of the elements of each @xmath64 .",
    "for example , say that under the perspective presented in the previous paragraph , the private utility is a function of some components @xmath16 of @xmath35 , components that do not include the \\{@xmath75}. now modify this perspective so that in addition to the dynamics of other bits , @xmath63 also encapsulates the dynamics of the bits \\{@xmath75}. having done this , we could still view each private utility as being fixed , but rather than take the bits \\{@xmath75 } as `` encoding '' the subroutine that specifies the private utility of microlearner @xmath4 , we would treat them as `` parameters '' specifying the functional dependence of the ( fixed ) private utility on the components of @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , formally , they constitute an extra set of arguments to @xmath4 s private utility , in addition to the arguments @xmath16 .",
    "alternatively , we could simply say that in this situation our private utilities are time - indexed , with @xmath4 s private utility at time @xmath17 determined by \\{@xmath76 } , which in turn is determined by evolution under @xmath63 . under either interpretation of private utility , any modification under @xmath63 to the bits specifying @xmath4 s",

    "this is why the strategy of trying to improve world utility by using macrolearning to try to induce salient characteristics is almost always ultimately based on an assumption rather than a proof .    *",
    "10 ) * we are provided with some von neumann * world utility * @xmath77 that ranks the various conceivable worldlines of the coin .",
    "note that since the environment node is never directly observed , we implicitly assume that the world utility is not directly ( ! ) a function of its state .",
    "our mathematics will not involve @xmath78 alone , but rather the relationship between @xmath78 and various sets of * personal utilities * @xmath79 .    intuitively , as discussed below , for many purposes such personal utilities are equivalent to arbitrary `` virtual '' versions of the private utilities mentioned above .",
    "in particular , it is only private utilities that will occur within any microlearning computer algorithms that may be running in the coin as manifested in @xmath63 .",
    "personal utilities are external mathematical constructions that the coin framework employs to analyze the behavior of the system .",
    "they can be involved in learning processes , but only as tools that are employed outside of the coin s evolution under @xmath63 , _",
    "i.e. _ , only in macrolearning .",
    "( for example , analysis of them can be used to modify the private utilities . )    * observation 10.1 : * these utility definitions are very broad . in particular , they do not require casting of the utilities as discounted sums .",
    "note also that our world utility is not indexed by @xmath17 . again reflecting the descriptive , worldline character of the formalism",
    ", we simply assign a single value to an entire worldline of the system , implicitly assuming that one can always say which of two candidate worldlines are preferable .",
    "so given some `` present time '' @xmath80 , issues like which of two `` potential futures '' @xmath81 , @xmath82 is preferable are resolved by evaluating the relevant utility at two associated points @xmath35 and @xmath83 , where the @xmath84 components of those points are the futures indicated , and the two points share the same ( usually implicit ) @xmath85 `` past '' components .",
    "this time - independence of @xmath78 automatically avoids formal problems that can occur with general ( _ i.e. _ , not necessarily discounted sum ) time - indexed utilities , problems like having what s optimal at one moment in time conflict with what s optimal at other moments in time .. the effects of the actions by the nodes , adn therefore whether those actions are `` optimal '' or not , depends on the future actions of the nodes .",
    "however if they too are to be `` optimal '' , according to their world - utility , those future actions will depend on _ their _ futures .",
    "so we have a potentially infinite regress of differing stipulations of what `` optimal '' actions at time @xmath17 entails . ] for personal utilities such formal problems are often irrelevant however .",
    "before we begin our work , we as coin designers must be able to rank all possible worldlines of the system at hand , to have a well - defined design task .",
    "that is why world utility can not be time - indexed .",
    "however if a particular microlearner s goal keeps changing in an inconsistent way , that simply means that that microlearner will grow `` confused '' . from our perspective as coin designers",
    ", there is nothing _ a priori _ unacceptable about such confusion .",
    "it may even result in better performance of the system as a whole , in whic case we would actually want to induce it .",
    "nonetheless , for simplicity , in most of this paper we will have all @xmath86 be independent of @xmath17 , just like world utility .",

    "consider any ( time - independent ) world utility @xmath87 that equals @xmath88 for some function @xmath89 and some positive constant @xmath90 with magnitude less than 1 .",
    "then for any @xmath91 and any @xmath83 and @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 = sgn[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty } \\gamma^t r(\\underline{\\zeta}'_{,t } ) - \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty } \\gamma^t r(\\underline{\\zeta''}_{,t})]$ ] .",

    "since utility functions are , by definition , only unique up to the relative orderings they impose on potential values of their arguments , we see that conventional rl s use of a time - dependent discounted sum world utility @xmath96 is identical to use of a particular time - independent world utility in our coin framework .    *",

    "the personal utility functions \\{@xmath97 } do not exist `` inside the coin '' ; they are not specified by components of @xmath35 .",
    "this separating of the private utilities from the \\{@xmath97 } will allow us to avoid the teleological problem that one may not always be able to explicitly identify `` the '' private utility function reflected in @xmath35 such that a particular computational device can be said to be a microlearner `` trying to increase the value of its private utility '' . to the degree that we can couch the theorems purely in terms of personal rather than private utilities",
    ", we will have successfully adopted a purely behaviorist approach , without any need to interpret what a computational device is `` trying to do '' .    despite this formal distinction",
    "though , often we will implicitly have in mind deploying the personal utilities onto the microlearners as their private utilities , in which case the terms can usually be used interchangeably .",

    "formally , such a measure is a mapping from three arguments to @xmath98 .",
    "such a measure will also allow us to quantify how well each microlearner performs in purely behavioral terms , in terms of its personal utility .",

    "this behaviorism in turn will allow us to avoid having private utilities explicitly arise in our theorems ( although they still arise frequently in pedagogical discussion ) .",
    "even when private utilities exist , there will be no formal need to explicitly identify some components of @xmath35 as such utilities . assuming a node s microlearner is competent , the fact that it is trying to optimize some particular private utility @xmath99 will be manifested in our performance measure s having a large value at @xmath35 for @xmath63 for that utility @xmath99 .",
    "the problem of how to formally define such a performance measure is essentially equivalent to the problem of how to quantify bounded rationality in game theory . some of the relevant work in game theory , for example that involving ` trembling hand equilibria ' or ` @xmath100 equilibria ' @xcite is concerned with refinements or modifications of nash equilibria ( see also  @xcite ) . rather than a behaviorist approach , such work adopts a strongly teleological perspective on rationality . in general ,",
    "such work is only applicable to those situations where the rationality is bounded due to the precise causal mechanisms investigated in that work .",
    "most of the other game - theoretic work first models ( ! ) the microlearner , as some extremely simple computational device ( _ e.g. _ , a deterministic finite automaton ( dfa ) .",
    "one then assumes that the microlearner performs perfectly for that device , so that one can measure that learner s performance in terms of some computational capacity measure of the model ( _ e.g. _ , for a dfa , the number of states of that dfa ) @xcite .",
    "however , if taken as renditions of real - world computer - based microlearners  never mind human microlearners the models in this approach are often extremely abstracted , with many important characteristics of the real learners absent or distorted .",
    "in addition , there is little reason to believe that any results arising from this approach would not be highly dependent on the model choice and on the associated representation of computational capacity .",
    "yet another disadvantage is that this approach concentrates on perfect , fully rational behavior of the microlearners , within their computational restrictions .",
    "we would prefer a less model - dependent approach , especially given our wish that the performance measure be based solely on the utility function at hand , @xmath35 , and @xmath63 .",
    "now we do nt want our performance measure to be a `` raw '' utility value like @xmath101 , since that is not invariant with respect to monotonic transformations of @xmath102 .",
    "similarly , we do nt want to penalize the microlearner for not achieving a certain utility value if that value was impossible to achieve not due to the microlearner s shortcomings , but rather due to @xmath63 and the actions of other nodes .",
    "a natural way to address these concerns is to generalize the game - theoretic concept of `` best - response strategy '' and consider the problem of how well @xmath33 performs _ given the actions of the other nodes_. such a measure would compare the utility ultimately induced by each of the possible states of @xmath33 at some particular time , which without loss of generality we can take to be 0 , to that induced by the actual state @xmath103 . in other words , we would compare the utility of the actual worldline @xmath35 to those of a set of alternative worldlines @xmath83 , where @xmath104 , and use those comparisons to quantify the quality of @xmath33 s performance .",
    "now we are only concerned with comparing the effects of replacing @xmath35 with @xmath83 on @xmath105 contributions to the utility .",
    "but if we allow arbitrary @xmath106 , then in and of themselves the difference between those past components of @xmath83 and those of @xmath35 can modify the value of the utility , regardless of the effects of any difference in the future components .",
    "our presumption is that for many coins of interest we can avoid this conundrum by restricting attention to those @xmath83 where @xmath106 differs from @xmath107 only in the internal parameters of @xmath33 s microlearner , differences that only at times @xmath108 manifest themselves in a form the utility is concerned with .",
    "( in game - theoretic terms , such `` internal parameters '' encode full extensive - form strategies , and we only consider changes to the vertices at or below the @xmath109 level in the tree of an extensive - form strategy . )    although this solution to our conundrum is fine when we can apply it , we do nt want to restrict the formalism so that it can only concern systems having computational algorithms which involve a clearly pre - specified set of extensive strategy `` internal parameters '' and the like .",
    "so instead , we formalize our presumption behaviorally , even for computational algorithms that do not have explicit extensive strategy internal parameters . since changing the internal parameters does nt affect the @xmath110 components of @xmath111 _ that the utility is concerned with _ , and since we are only concerned with changes to @xmath35 that affect the utility , we simply elect to not change the @xmath110 values of the internal parameters of @xmath111 at all .",
    "in other words , we leave @xmath112unchanged .",
    "the advantage of this stipulation is that we can apply it just as easily whether @xmath33 does or does nt have any `` internal parameters '' in the first place .",
    "so in quantifying the performance of @xmath33 for behavior given by @xmath35 we compare @xmath35 to a set of @xmath83 , a set restricted to those @xmath83 sharing @xmath35 s past : @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . since @xmath116 is free to vary ( reflecting the possible changes in the state of @xmath33 at time 0 ) while @xmath106 is not , @xmath117 , in general .",

    ", we can define a distribution @xmath151 reflecting what @xmath33 does / doesnt know concerning the actual state of the outside world @xmath152 at time 0 . if the node @xmath33 chooses its actions in a bayes - optimal manner , then @xmath153 $ ] , where @xmath141 runs over the allowed action components of @xmath33 at time 0 . since this will differ from @xmath154 $ ] in general ,",
    "this bayes - optimal node s intelligence will be less than 1 for the particular @xmath35 at hand , in general .",
    "moreover , the less @xmath99 s ultimate value ( after the application of @xmath63 , etc . ) depends on @xmath135 , the smaller the difference in these two argmax - based @xmath141 s , and therefore the higher the intelligence of @xmath33 , in general.s ultimate value to not depend on @xmath135 . ]",
    "we would like a measure of @xmath99 that captures these efects , but without depending on function maximization or any other detailed aspects of how the node determines its actions .",
    "one natural way to do this is via the * ( utility ) learnability * : given a measure @xmath131 restricted to a manifold @xmath63 , the ( @xmath155 ) utility learnability of a utility @xmath99 for a node @xmath33 at @xmath35 is : @xmath156 * intelligence learnability * is defined the same way , with @xmath157 replaced by @xmath158 .",

    "the integrand in the numerator of the definition of learnability reflects how much of the change in @xmath99 that results from replacing @xmath129 with @xmath161 is due to the change in @xmath33 s @xmath122 state ( the `` signal '' ) .",
    "the denominator reflects how much of the change in @xmath99 that results from replacing @xmath35 with @xmath83 is due to the change in the @xmath162 states of nodes other than @xmath33 ( the `` noise '' ) .",
    "so learnability quantifies how easy it is for the microlearner to discern the `` echo '' of its behavior in the utility function @xmath99 .",
    "our presumption is that the microlearning algorithm will achieve higher intelligence if provided with a more learnable private utility .",
    "intuitively , the ( utility ) * differential learnability * of @xmath99 at a point @xmath35 is the learnability with @xmath130 restricted to an infinitesimal ball about @xmath35 .",
    "we formalize it as the following ratio of magnitudes of a pair of gradients , one involving @xmath33 , and one involving @xmath152 : @xmath163    note that a particular value of differential utility learnability , by itself , has no significance . simply rescaling",
    "the units of @xmath103 will change that value .",
    "rather what is important is the ratio of differential learnabilities , at the same @xmath35 , for different @xmath99 s .",
    "such a ratio quantifies the relative preferability of those @xmath99 s .",
    "one nice feature of differential learnability is that unlike learnability , it does not depend on choice of some measure @xmath164 .",
    "this independence can lead to trouble if one is not careful however , and in particular if one uses learnability for purposes other than choosing between utility functions .",
    "for example , in some situations , the coin designer will have the option of enlarging the set of variables from the rest of the coin that are `` input '' to some node @xmath33 at @xmath162 and that therefore can be used by @xmath33 to decide what action to take .",
    "intuitively , doing so will not affect the rl `` signal '' for @xmath33 s microlearner ( the magnitude of the potential `` echo '' of @xmath33 s actions are not modified by changing some aspect of how it chooses among those actions ) .",
    "however it _ will _ reduce the `` noise '' , in that @xmath33 s microlearner now knows more about the state of the rest of the system .    in the full integral version of learnability",
    ", this effect can be captured by having the support of @xmath164 restricted to reflect the fact that the extra inputs to @xmath33 at @xmath122 are correlated with the @xmath122 state of the external system . in differential",
    "learnability however this is not possible , precisely because no measure @xmath164 occurs in its definition .",
    "so we must capture the reduction in noise in some other fashion .",
    "occurring in the definition of differential learnability with something more nuanced .",
    "for example , one may wish to replace it with the maximum of the dot product of @xmath165 with any @xmath39 vector @xmath166 , subject not only to the restrictions that @xmath167 and @xmath168 * 0 * , but also subject to the restriction that @xmath166 must lie in the tangent plane of @xmath63 at @xmath35 .",
    "the first two restrictions , in concert with the extra restriction that @xmath169 * 0 * , give the original definition of the noise term . if they are instead joined with the third , new restriction , they will enforce any applicable coupling between the state of @xmath33 at time 0 and the rest of the system at time 0 . solving with lagrange multipliers , we get @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the normal to @xmath63 at @xmath35 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 while @xmath174 . as a practical matter",
    "though , it is often simplest to assume that the @xmath135 can vary arbitrarily , independent of @xmath103 , so that the noise term takes the form in eq . 3 . ]    alternatively , if the extra variables are being input to @xmath33 for all @xmath108 , not just at @xmath162 , and if @xmath33 `` pays attention '' to those variables for all @xmath108 , then by incorporating those changes into our system @xmath63 itself has changed , @xmath175 .",
    "hypothesize that at those @xmath17 the node @xmath33 is capable of modifying its actions to `` compensate '' for what ( due to our augmentation of @xmath33 s inputs ) @xmath33 now knows to be going on outside of it . under this hypothesis , those changes in those external events will have less of an effect on the ultimate value of @xmath97 than they would if we had not made our modification .",
    "in this situation , the noise term has been reduced , so that the differential learnabiliity properly captures the effect of @xmath33 s having more inputs .    another potential danger to bear in mind concerning differential learnability is that it is usually best to consider its average over a region , in particular over points with less than maximal intelligence .",
    "it is really designed for such points ; in fact , at the intelligence - maximizing @xmath35 , @xmath176 .    whether in its differential form or not , and whether referring to utilities or intelligence , learnability is not meant to capture all factors that will affect how high an intelligence value a particular microlearner will achieve .",
    "such an all - inclusive definition is not possible , if for no other reason the fact that there are many such factors that are idiosyncratic to the particular microlearner used . beyond this",
    "though , certain more general factors that affect most popular learning algorithms , like the curse of dimensionality , are also not ( explicitly ) designed into learnability .",
    "learnability is not meant to provide a full characterization of performance  that is what intelligence is designed to do .",
    "rather ( relative ) learnability is ony meant to provide a _ guide _ for how to improve performance .    a system that has infinite ( differential , intelligence ) learnability for all its personal utilities is said to be `` perfectly '' ( differential , intelligence ) learnable .",
    "it is straight - forward to prove that a system is perfectly learnable @xmath177 iff @xmath178 can be written as @xmath179 for some function @xmath180 .",
    "( see the discussion below on the general condition for a system s being perfectly factored . )      with these definitions in hand , we can now present ( a portion of ) one descriptive framework for coins . in this subsection , after discussing salient characteristics in general , we present some theorems concerning the relationship between personal utilities and the salient characteristic we choose to concentrate on .",
    "we then discus how to use these theorems to induce that salient characteristic in a coin .",
    "the starting point with a descriptive framework is the identification of `` salient characteristics of a coin which one strongly expects to be associated with its having large world utility '' . in this chapter",
    "we will focus on salient characteristics that concern the relationship between personal and world utilities .",
    "these characteristics are formalizations of the intuition that we want coins in which the competent greedy pursuit of their private utilities by the microlearners results in large world utility , without any bottlenecks , toc , `` frustration '' ( in the spin glass sense ) or the like .",
    "one natural candidate for such a characteristic , related to pareto optimality  @xcite , is * weak triviality*. it is defined by considering any two worldlines @xmath35 and @xmath83 both of which are consistent with the system s dynamics ( _ i.e. _ , both of which lie on @xmath63 ) , where for every node @xmath33 , @xmath181 . , and require only that both of the `` partial vectors '' @xmath182 and @xmath183 obey the relevant dynamical laws , and therefore lie in @xmath184 . ] if for any such pair of worldlines where one `` pareto dominates '' the other it is necessarily true that @xmath185 , we say that the system is weakly trivial",
    ". we might expect that systems that are weakly trivial for the microlearners private utilities are configured correctly for inducing large world utility .",
    "after all , for such systems , if the microlearners collectively change @xmath35 in a way that ends up helping all of them , then necessarily the world utility also rises .",
    "more formally , for a weakly trivial system , the maxima of @xmath78 are pareto - optimal points for the personal utilities ( although the reverse need not be true ) .",
    "as it turns out though , weakly trivial systems can readily evolve to a world utility @xmath186 , one that often involves toc . to see this ,",
    "consider automobile traffic in the absence of any traffic control system .",
    "let each node be a different driver , and say their private utilities are how quickly they each individually get to their destination .",
    "identify world utility as the sum of private utilities .",
    "then by simple additivity , for all @xmath35 and @xmath83 , whether they lie on @xmath63 or not , if @xmath187 it follows that @xmath185 ; the system is weakly trivial .",
    "however as any driver on a rush - hour freeway with no carpool lanes or metering lights can attest , every driver s pursuing their own goal definitely does not result in acceptable throughput for the system as a whole ; modifications to private utility functions ( like fines for violating carpool lanes or metering lights ) would result in far better global behavior .",
    "a system s being weakly trivial provides no assurances regarding world utility .",
    "this does not mean weak triviality is never of use .",
    "for example , say that for a set of weakly trivial personal utilities each agent can guarantee that _ regardless of what the other agents do _ , its utility is above a certain level .",
    "assume further that , being risk - averse , each agent chooses an action with such a guarantee .",
    "say it is also true that the agents are provided with a relatively large set of candidate guaranteed values of their utilities . under these circumstances",
    ", the system s being weakly trivial provides some assurances that world utility is not too low .",
    "moreover , if the overhead in enforcing such a future - guaranteeing scheme is small , and having a sizable set of guaranteed candidate actions provided to each of the agents does not require an excessively centralized infrastructure , we can actually employ this kind of scheme in practice .",
    "indeed , in the extreme case , one can imagine that every agent is guaranteed exactly what its utility would be for every one of its candidate actions .",
    "( see the discussion on general equilibrium in the background section above . ) in this situation , nash equilibria and pareto optimal points are identical , which due to weak triviality means that the point maximizing @xmath78 is a nash equilibrium .",
    "however in any less extreme situation , the system may not achieve a value of world utility that is close to optimal .",
    "this is because even for weakly trivial systems a pareto optimal point may have poor world utility , in general .",
    "situations where one has guarantees of lower bounds on one s utility are not too common , but they do arise .",
    "one important example is a round of trades in a computational market ( see the background section above ) . in that scenario",
    ", there is an agent - indexed set of functions \\{@xmath188 } and the personal utility of each agent @xmath189 is given by @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the end of the round of trades .",
    "there is also a function @xmath192 @xmath193 that is a monotonically increasing function of its arguments , and world utility @xmath78 is given by @xmath194 .",
    "so the system is weakly trivial . in turn , each @xmath195 is determined solely by the `` allotment of goods '' possessed by @xmath33 , as specified in the appropriate components of @xmath196 . to be able to remove uncertainty about its future value of @xmath197 in this kind of system ,",
    "in determining its trading actions each agent @xmath33 must employ some scheme like inter - agent contracts .",
    "this is because without such a scheme , no agent can be assured that if it agrees to a proposed trade with another agent that the full proposed transaction of that trade actually occurs .",
    "given such a scheme , if in each trade round @xmath17 each agent @xmath33 myopically only considers those trades that are assured of increasing the corresponding value of @xmath197 , then we are guaranteed that the value of the world utility is not less than the initial value @xmath198 .    the problem with using weak triviality as a general salient characteristic is precisely the fact that the individual microlearners @xmath199 greedy . in a coin , there is no system - wide incentive to replace @xmath35 with a different worldline that would improve everybody s private utility , as in the definition of weak triviality .",
    "rather the incentives apply to each microlearner individually and motivate the learners to behave in a way that may well hurt some of them .",
    "so weak triviality is , upon examination , a poor choice for the salient characteristic of a coin .",
    "one alternative to weak triviality follows from consideration of the stricture that we must ` expect ' a salient characteristic to be coupled to large world utility in a running real - world coin . what can we reasonably expect about a running real - world coin ?",
    "we can not assume that all the private utilities will have large values  witness the traffic example .",
    "but we @xmath200 assume that if the microlearners are well - designed , each of them will be doing close to as well it can _ given the behavior of the other nodes_. in other words , within broad limits we can assume that the system is more likely to be in @xmath35 than @xmath83 if for all @xmath33 , @xmath201 .",
    "we define a system to be * coordinated * iff for any such @xmath35 and @xmath83 lying on @xmath63 , @xmath185 .",
    "( again , an obvious variant is to restrict @xmath202 , and require only that both @xmath183 and @xmath182 lie in @xmath184 . )",
    "traffic systems are @xmath74 coordinated , in general .",
    "this is evident from the simple fact that if all drivers acted as though there were metering lights when in fact there were nt any , they would each be behaving with lower intelligence given the actions of the other drivers ( each driver would benefit greatly by changing its behavior by no longer pretending there were metering lights , etc . ) . but nonetheless , world utility would be higher .      like weak triviality , coordination is intimately related to the economics concept of pareto optimality .",
    "unfortunately , there is not room in this chapter to present the mathematics associated with coordination and its variants . we will instead discuss a third candidate salient characteristic of coins , one which like coordination ( and unlike weak triviality ) we can reasonably expect to be associated with large world utility",
    "this alternative fixes weak triviality not by replacing the personal utilities \\{@xmath97 } with the intelligences \\{@xmath203 } as coordination does , but rather by only considering worldlines whose difference at time 0 involves a single node .",
    "this results in this alternative s being related to nash equilibria rather than pareto optimality .",
    "say that our coin s worldline is @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath83 be any other worldline where @xmath204 , and where @xmath205 .",
    "now restrict attention to those @xmath83 where at @xmath162 @xmath35 and @xmath83 differ only for node @xmath33 .",
    "if for all such @xmath83 @xmath206 = sgn[g(\\underline{\\zeta } ) - g(\\underline{\\zeta}_{,t<0 } \\bullet c(\\underline{\\zeta}'_{,0 } ) ) ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] and if this is true for all nodes @xmath33 , then we say that the coin is * factored * for all those utilities \\{@xmath102 } ( at @xmath35 , with respect to time 0 and the utility @xmath78 ) .    for a factored system , for any node @xmath33 ,",
    "_ given the rest of the system _ , if the node s state at @xmath162 changes in a way that improves that node s utility over the rest of time , then it necessarily also improves world utility .",
    "colloquially , for a system that is factored for a particular microlearner s private utility , if that learner does something that improves that personal utility , then everything else being equal , it has also done something that improves world utility .",
    "of two potential microlearners for controlling node @xmath33 ( _ i.e. _ , two potential @xmath145 ) whose behavior until @xmath122 is identical but which differ there , the microlearner that is smarter with respect to @xmath14 will always result in a larger @xmath14 , by definition of intelligence .",
    "accordingly , for a factored system , the smarter microlearner is also the one that results in better @xmath78 .",
    "so as long as we have deployed a sufficiently smart microlearner on @xmath33 , we have assured a good @xmath78 ( given the rest of the system ) .",
    "formally , this is expressed in the fact @xcite that for a factored system , for all nodes @xmath33 , @xmath207    one can also prove that nash equilibria of a factored system are local maxima of world utility .",
    "note that in keeping with our behaviorist perspective , nothing in the definition of factored requires the existence of private utilities .",
    "indeed , it may well be that a system having private utilities \\{@xmath134 } is factored , but for personal utilities \\{@xmath102 } that differ from the \\{@xmath134}.    a system s being factored does @xmath74 mean that a change to @xmath103 that improves @xmath146 can not also hurt @xmath208 for some @xmath209 .",
    "intuitively , for a factored system , the side effects on the rest of the system of @xmath33 s increasing its own utility do not end up decreasing world utility  but can have arbitrarily adverse effects on other private utilities .",
    "( in the language of economics , no stipulation is made that @xmath33 s `` costs are endogenized . '' ) for factored systems , the separate microlearners successfully pursuing their separate goals do not frustrate each other _ as far as world utility is concerned_.    in addition , if @xmath210 is factored with respect to @xmath78 , then a change to @xmath211 that improves @xmath212 improves @xmath213 .",
    "but it may @xmath214 some @xmath215 and/or @xmath216 .",
    "( this is even true for a discounted sum of rewards personal utility , so long as @xmath217 . )",
    "an example of this would be an economic system cast as a single individual , @xmath33 , together with an environment node , where @xmath78 is a steeply discounted sum of rewards @xmath33 receives over his / her lifetime , @xmath217 , and @xmath218 , @xmath219 .",
    "for such a situation , it may be appropriate for @xmath33 to live extravagantly at the time @xmath61 , and `` pay for it '' later .",
    "as an instructive example of the ramifications of eq .",

    "a computer s `` state '' consists of the values of all its bits , including its code segment , i.e. , including the program it is running .",
    "so for a factored personal utility @xmath102 , if the program running on the computer is better than most others as far as @xmath102 is concerned , then it is also better than most other programs as far as @xmath78 is concerned .",
    "our task as coin designers engaged in coin initialization or macrolearning is to find such a program and such an associated @xmath102 .",
    "one way to approach this task is to restrict attention to programs that consist of rl algorithms with private utility specified in the bits \\{@xmath75 } of @xmath33 .",
    "this reduces the task to one of finding a private utility \\{@xmath75 } ( and thereby fully specifying @xmath103 ) such that our rl algorithm working with that private utility has high @xmath138 , i.e. , such that that algorithm outperforms most other programs as far as the personal utility @xmath97 is concerned .",
    "perhaps the simplest way to address this reduced task is to exploit the fact that for a good enough rl algorithm @xmath221 will be large , and therefore adopt such an rl algorithm and fix the private utility to equal @xmath97 . in this way",
    "we further reduce the original task , which was to search over all personal utilities @xmath97 and all programs @xmath222 to find a pair such that both @xmath97 is factored with respect to @xmath78 and there are relatively few programs that outperform @xmath222 , as far as @xmath97 .",

    ", rl - based or not ) that outperform our rl algorithm working on \\{@xmath75 } , as far as that self - same private utility is concerned .",
    "the crucial assumption being leveraged in this approach is that our rl algorithm is `` good enough '' , and the reason we want learnable \\{@xmath75 } is to help effect this assumption .    in general though",
    ", we ca nt have both perfect learnability and perfect factoredness . as an example , say that @xmath223 , and that the dynamics is the identity operator : @xmath218 , @xmath224 . then if @xmath225 and the system is perfectly learnable , it is not perfectly factored .",

    "for the `` wrong '' sign of @xmath135 , this means the system is actually `` anti - factored '' . due to such incompatibility between perfect factoredness and perfect learnability , we must usually be content with having high degree of factoredness and high learnability . in such situations ,",
    "the emphasis of the macrolearning process should be more and more on having high degree of factoredness as we get closer and closer to a nash equilibrium . this way the system wo nt relax to an incorrect local maximum .",

    ".    we can view @xmath33 s effect set wlu as analogous to the change in world utility that would have arisen if node @xmath33 `` had never existed '' .",
    "( hence the name of this utility - cf . the frank capra movie . )",
    "note however , that @xmath276 is a purely `` fictional '' , counter - factual operation , in the sense that it produces a new @xmath35 without taking into account the system s dynamics .",
    "indeed , no assumption is even being made that @xmath277 is consistent with the dynamics of the system .",
    "the sequence of states the node @xmath33 is clamped to in the definition of the wlu need not be consistent with the dynamical laws embodied in @xmath63 .",
    "this dynamics - independence is a crucial strength of the wlu .",
    "it means that to evaluate the wlu we do _ not _ try to infer how the system would have evolved if node @xmath33 s state were set to 0 at time 0 and the system evolved from there .",
    "so long as we know @xmath35 extending over all time , and so long as we know @xmath78 , we know the value of wlu .",
    "this is true even if we know nothing of the dynamics of the system .",
    "an important example is effect set wonderful life utilities when the set of all nodes is partitioned into ` subworlds ' in such a way that all nodes in the same subworld @xmath278 share substantially the same effect set .",
    "in such a situation , all nodes in the same subworld @xmath278 will have essentially the same personal utilities , exactly as they would if they used team game utilities with a `` world '' given by @xmath278 .",
    "when all such nodes have large intelligence values , this sharing of the personal utility will mean that all nodes in the same subworld are acting in a coordinated fashion , loosely speaking .",
    "the importance of the wlu arises from the following results :    * theorem 2 : * i ) a system is factored at all @xmath230 iff for all those @xmath35 , @xmath231 , we can write @xmath279 for some function @xmath280 such that @xmath281 for all @xmath230 and associated @xmath78 values .",
    "( the form of the \\{@xmath97 } off of @xmath63 is arbitrary . )",
    "\\ii ) in particular , a coin is factored for personal utilities set equal to the associated effect set wonderful life utilities .    *",
    "proof : * to prove ( i ) , first write @xmath282 . for all @xmath249 , @xmath283 is independent of @xmath103 , and so by definition of @xmath60 it is a single - valued function of @xmath135 for such @xmath35 .",
    "therefore @xmath284 for some function @xmath285 .",
    "accordingly , by thm .",
    "1 , for \\{@xmath97 } of the form stipulated in ( i ) , the system is factored .",
    "going the other way , if the system is factored , then by thm .",
    "1 it can be written as @xmath237 . since both @xmath107 and @xmath286 , we can rewrite this as @xmath287_{,t<0 } , [ \\hat{}c^{eff}_{\\eta}]_{\\;\\hat{}\\eta,0 } , g(\\underline{\\zeta}))$ ] . *",
    "qed . *    part ( ii ) of the theorem follows immediately from part ( i ) . for pedagogical value",
    "though , here we instead derive it directly .",
    "first , since @xmath288 is independent of @xmath264 for all @xmath289 , so is the @xmath290 vector @xmath291 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath292_{\\eta',t } = \\vec{0 } \\;\\ ; \\forall ( \\eta ' , t ) \\in c^{eff}_\\eta$ ] .",
    "this means that viewed as a @xmath107-parameterized function from @xmath293 to @xmath290 , @xmath294 is a single - valued function of the @xmath295 components .",
    "therefore @xmath296 can only depend on @xmath107 and the non-@xmath33 components of @xmath129 .",
    "accordingly , the wlu for @xmath266 is just @xmath78 minus a term that is a function of @xmath107 and @xmath295 . by choosing @xmath233 in thm . 1 to be that difference",
    ", we see that @xmath33 s effect set wlu is of the form necessary for the system to be factored . *",
    "qed . *    as a generalization of ( ii ) , the system is factored if each node @xmath33 s personal utility is ( a monotonically increasing function of ) the wlu for a set @xmath297 that contains @xmath266 .    for conciseness ,",
    "except where explicitly needed , for the remainder of this subsection we will suppress the argument `` @xmath107 '' , taking it to be implicit .",
    "the next result concerning the practical importance of effect set wlu is the following :    * theorem 3 : * let @xmath269 be a set containing @xmath298 . then @xmath299    * proof : * writing it out , @xmath300 the second term in the numerator equals 0 , by definition of effect set .",
    "dividing by the similar expression for @xmath301 then gives the result claimed .",
    "* qed . *",
    "so if we expect that ratio of magnitudes of gradients to be large , effect set wlu has much higher learnability than team game utility  while still being factored , like team game utility . as an example , consider the case where the coin is a very large system , with @xmath33 being only a relatively minor part of the system ( _ e.g. _ , a large human economy with @xmath33 being a `` typical john doe living in peoria illinois '' ) .",
    "often in such a system , for the vast majority of nodes @xmath302 , how @xmath78 varies with @xmath303 will be essentially independent of the value @xmath103 .",
    "( for example , how gdp of the us economy varies with the actions of our john doe from peoria , illinois will be independent of the state of some jane smith living in los angeles , california . ) in such circumstances , thm .",
    "3 tells us that the effect set wonderful life utility for @xmath33 will have a far larger learnability than does the world utility .    for any fixed @xmath269 ,",
    "if we change the clamping operation ( _ i.e. _ , change the choice of the `` arbitrary fixed value '' we clamp each component to ) , then we change the mapping @xmath304 , and therefore change the mapping @xmath305 . accordingly , changing the clamping operation can affect the value of @xmath306 evaluated at some point @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , by thm .",
    "3 , changing the clamping operation can affect @xmath307 .",
    "so properly speaking , for any choice of @xmath269 , if we are going to use @xmath308 , we should set the clamping operation so as to maximize learnability . for simplicity",
    "though , in this paper we will ignore this phenomenon , and simply set the clamping operation to the more or less `` natural '' choice of * 0 * , as mentioned above .",
    "next consider the case where , for some node @xmath33 , we can write @xmath309 as @xmath310",
    ". say it is also true that @xmath33 s effect set is a small fraction of the set of all components . in this case",
    "it often true that the values of @xmath311 are much larger than those of @xmath312 , which means that partial derivatives of @xmath311 are much larger than those of @xmath312 . in such situations",
    "the effect set wlu is far more learnable than the world utility , due to the following results :    * theorem 4 : * if for some node @xmath33 there is a set @xmath269 containing @xmath313 , a function @xmath314 , and a function @xmath315 , such that @xmath316 , then @xmath317    * proof : * for brevity , write @xmath318 and @xmath319 both as functions of full @xmath320 , just such functions that are only allowed to depend on the components of @xmath35 that lie in @xmath269 and those components that do not lie in @xmath269 , respectively",
    ". then the @xmath269 wlu for node @xmath33 is just @xmath321 . since in that second term",
    "we are clamping all the components of @xmath35 that @xmath312 cares about , for this personal utility @xmath322 .",
    "so in particular @xmath323 .",
    "now by definition of effect set , @xmath324 , since @xmath325 does not contain @xmath298 .",
    "so @xmath326 .",
    "* qed . *    the obvious extensions of thm.s 3 and 4 to effect sets with respect to times other than 0 can also be proven  @xcite .",
    "an important special case of thm .",
    "4 is the following :    * corollary 1 : * if for some node @xmath33 we can write    \\i ) @xmath327_{t\\ge0 } ) + g_3(\\underline{\\zeta}_{,t<0})$ ]    for some set @xmath269 containing @xmath313 , and if    \\ii ) @xmath328_{\\sigma } ) ||$ ] ,    then    @xmath329 .    in practice , to assure that condition ( i ) of this corollary is met might require that @xmath269 be a proper superset of @xmath266 .",
    "countervailingly , to assure that condition ( ii ) is met will usually force us to keep @xmath269 as small as possible .",
    "one can often remove elements from an effect set and still have the results of this section hold .",
    "most obviously , if ( @xmath53 , t ) @xmath330 but @xmath331 = * 0 * , we can remove ( @xmath53 , t ) from @xmath266 without invalidating our results . more generally , if there is a set @xmath332 such that for each component ( @xmath333 the chain rule term @xmath334 \\;\\cdot \\ ; [ \\partial_{\\underline{\\zeta}_{\\eta,0;i } } [ c(\\underline{\\zeta}_{,0})]_{\\eta',t}]$ ] = 0 , then the effects on @xmath78 of changes to @xmath103 that are `` mediated '' by the members of @xmath335 cancel each other out .",
    "in this case we can usually remove the elements of @xmath335 from @xmath266 with no ill effects .",
    "usually the mathematics of a descriptive framework  a formal investigation of the salient characteristics  will not provide theorems of the sort , `` if you modify the coin the following way at time @xmath17 , the value of the world utility will increase . ''",
    "rather it provides theorems that relate a coin s salient characteristics with the general properties of the coin s entire history , and in particular with those properties embodied in @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , the salient characteristic that we are concerned with in this chapter is that the system be highly intelligent for personal utilities for which it is factored , and our mathematics concerns the relationship between factoredness , intelligence , personal utilities , effect sets , and the like .",
    "more formally , the desideratum associated with our salient characteristic is that we want the coin to be at a @xmath35 for which there is some set of \\{@xmath97 } ( not necessarily consisting of private utilities ) such that ( a ) @xmath35 is factored for the \\{@xmath97 } , and ( b ) @xmath132 is large for all @xmath33 .",
    "now there are several ways one might try to induce the coin to be at such a point .",
    "one approach is to have each algorithm controlling @xmath33 explicitly try to `` steer '' the worldline towards such a point . in this approach",
    "@xmath33 need nt even have a private utility in the usual sense .",
    "( the overt `` goal '' of the algorithm controlling @xmath33 involves finding a @xmath35 with a good associated extremum over the class of all possible @xmath97 , independent of any private utilities . ) now initialization of the coin , _",
    "i.e. _ , fixing of @xmath129 , involves setting the algorithm controlling @xmath33 , in this case to the steering algorithm .",
    "accordingly , in this approach to initialization , we fix @xmath129 to a point for which there is some special @xmath97 such that both @xmath336 is factored for @xmath97 , and @xmath337 is large",
    ". there is nothing peculiar about this .",
    "what is odd though is that in this approach we do not know what that `` special '' @xmath97 is when we do that initialization ; it s to be determined , by the unfolding of the system .    in this chapter",
    "we concentrate on a different approach , which can involve either initialization or macrolearning . in this alternative",
    "we deploy the \\{@xmath97 } as the microlearners private utilities at some @xmath338 , in a process not captured in @xmath63 , so as to induce a factored coin that is as intelligent as possible .",
    "( it is with that `` deploying of the \\{@xmath97 } '' that we are trying to induce our salient characteristic in the coin . ) since in this approach we are using private utilities , we can replace intelligence with its surrogate , learnability .",
    "so our task is to choose \\{@xmath97 } which are as learnable as possible while still being factored .    solving for such utilities",
    "can be expressed as solving a set of coupled partial differential equations .",
    "those equations involve the tangent plane to the manifold @xmath63 , a functional trading off ( the differential versions of ) degree of factoredness and learnability , and any communication constraints on the nodes we must respect .",
    "while there is not space in the current chapter to present those equations , we can note that they are highly dependent on the correlations among the components of @xmath31 .",
    "so in this approach , in coin initialization we use some preliminary guesses as to those correlations to set the initial \\{@xmath97}. for example , the effect set of a node constitutes all components @xmath339 that have non - zero correlation with @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , by thm .",
    "2 the system is factored for effect set wlu personal utilities . and by coroll .",
    "1 , for small effect sets , the effect set wlu has much greater differential utility learnability than does @xmath78 . extending the reasoning behind this result to all @xmath35 ( or at least all likely @xmath35 ) , we see that for this scenario , the descriptive framework advises us to use wonderful life private utilities based on ( guesses for ) the associated effect sets rather than the team game private utilities , @xmath340 .    in macrolearning we",
    "must instead run - time estimate an approximate solution to our partial differential equations , based on statistical inference . as an example",
    ", we might start with an initial guess as to @xmath33 s effect set , and set its private utility to the associated wlu .",
    "but then as we watch the system run and observe the correlations among the components of @xmath35 , we might modify which components we think comprise @xmath33 s effect set , and modify @xmath33 s personal utility accordingly .      as implied above",
    ", often one can perform reasonable coin initialization and/or macrolearning without writing down the partial differential equations governing our salient characteristic explicitly .",
    "simply `` hacking '' one s way to the goal of maximizing both degree of factoredness and intelligibility , for example by estimating effect sets , often results in dramatic improvement in performance .",
    "this is illustrated in the experiments recounted in the next two subsections .",
    "even if we do nt exactly know the effect set of each node @xmath33 , often we will be able to make a reasonable guess about which components of @xmath35 comprise the `` preponderance '' of @xmath33 s effect set .",
    "we call such a set a * guessed effect set*. as an example , often the primary effects of changes to @xmath33 s state will be on the future state of @xmath33 , with only relatively minor effects on the future states of other nodes . in such situations , we would expect to still get good results if we approximated the effect set wlu of each node @xmath33 with a wlu based on the guessed effect set @xmath341 .",
    "in other words , we would expect to be able to replace wlu@xmath342 with wlu@xmath343 and still get good performance .",
    "this phenomenon was borne out in the experiments recounted in @xcite that used coin initialization for distributed control of network packet routing . in a conventional approach to packet routing",
    ", each router runs what it believes ( based on the information available to it ) to be a shortest path algorithm ( spa ) , _ i.e. _ , each router sends its packets in the way that it surmises will get those packets to their destinations most quickly .",
    "unlike with an approach based on our coin framework , with spa - based routing the routers have no concern for the possible deleterious side - effects of their routing decisions on the global performance ( _ e.g. _ , they have no concern for whether they induce bottlenecks ) .",
    "we performed simulations in which we compared such a coin - based routing system to an spa - based system .",
    "for the coin - based system @xmath78 was global throughput and no macrolearning was used .",
    "the coin initialization was to have each router s private utility be a wlu based on an associated guessed effect set generated _",
    "a priori_. in addition , the coin - based system was realistic in that each router s reinforcement algorithm had imperfect knowledge of the state of the system .",
    "on the other hand , the spa was an idealized `` best - possible '' system , in which each router knew exactly what the shortest paths were at any given time . despite the handicap that this disparity imposed on the coin - based system , it achieved significantly better global throughput in our experiments than did the perfect - knowledge spa - based system , and in particular , avoided the braess paradox that was built - in to some of those systems  @xcite .",
    "the experiments in @xcite were primarily concerned with the application of packet - routing . to concentrate more precisely on the issue of coin initialization , we ran subsequent experiments on variants of arthur s famous `` el farol bar problem '' ( see section  [ sec : lit ] ) . to facilitate the analysis we modified arthur s original problem to be more general , and",
    "since we were not interested in directly comparing our results to those in the literature , we used a more conventional ( and arguably `` dumber '' ) machine learning algorithm than the ones investigated in  @xcite .    in this formulation of the bar problem  @xcite",
    ", there are @xmath344 agents , each of whom picks one of seven nights to attend a bar the following week , a process that is then repeated . in each week , each agent s pick is determined by its predictions of the associated rewards it would receive .",
    "these predictions in turn are based solely upon the rewards received by the agent in preceding weeks .",
    "an agent s `` pick '' at week @xmath17 ( _ i.e. _ , its node s state at that week ) is represented as a unary seven - dimensional vector .",
    "( see the discussion in the definitions subsection of our representing discrete variables as euclidean variables . )",
    "so @xmath33 s zeroing its state in some week , as in the cl@xmath345 operation , essentially means it elects not to attend any night that week .",
    "the world utility is @xmath346 where : @xmath347 ; @xmath348 is the total attendance on night @xmath349 at week @xmath17 ; @xmath350 ; and @xmath351 and each of the \\{@xmath352 } are real - valued parameters . intuitively , the `` world reward '' @xmath222 is the sum of the global `` rewards '' for each night in each week .",
    "it reflects the effects in the bar as the attendance profile of agents changes .",
    "when there are too few agents attending some night , the bar suffers from lack of activity and therefore the global reward for that night is low .",
    "conversely , when there are too many agents the bar is overcrowded and the reward for that night is again low .",
    "note that @xmath353 reaches its maximum when its argument equals @xmath351 .    in these experiments",
    "we investigate two different @xmath354 s .",
    "one treats all nights equally ; @xmath355 $ ] .",
    "the other is only concerned with one night ; @xmath356 $ ] . in our experiments ,",
    "@xmath357 and @xmath344 is chosen to be 4 times larger than the number of agents necessary to have @xmath351 agents attend the bar on each of the seven nights , _",
    "i.e. _ , there are @xmath358 agents ( this ensures that there are no trivial solutions and that for the world utility to be maximized , the agents have to `` cooperate '' ) .    as explained below , our microlearning algorithms worked by providing a real - valued `` reward '' signal to each agent at each week @xmath17 .",
    "each agent s reward function is a surrogate for an associated utility function for that agent .",
    "the difference between the two functions is that the reward function only reflects the state of the system at one moment in time ( and therefore is potentially observable ) , whereas the utility function reflects the agent s ultimate goal , and therefore can depend on the full history of that agent across time .",
    "we investigated three agent reward functions .",
    "one was based on effect set wlu .",
    "the other two were `` natural '' rewards included for comparison purposes . with @xmath359 the night selected by @xmath33 ,",
    "the three rewards are : @xmath360     \\mbox{global ( g ) : } \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\ ; \\ ; &       r_{\\eta}(\\underline{\\zeta}_{,t } ) &   \\equiv       r(\\underline{\\zeta}_{,t } ) = \\sum_{k=1}^7 \\gamma_k(x_k(\\underline{\\zeta}_{,t } ) )   \\\\ [ -.05 in ]     \\mbox{wonderful life ( wl ) : } \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   &      r_{\\eta}(\\underline{\\zeta}_{,t } ) & \\equiv       r(\\underline{\\zeta}_{,t } ) -      r(\\mbox{cl}_{\\underline{\\zeta}_{\\eta , t}}(\\underline{\\zeta}_{,t } ) ) \\\\ [ -.05 in ]   & & = \\gamma_{d_\\eta } ( x_{d_\\eta } ( \\underline{\\zeta}_{,t } ) ) -   \\gamma_{d_\\eta } ( x_{d_\\eta }     ( \\mbox{cl}_{\\underline{\\zeta}_{\\eta , t } } ( \\underline{\\zeta}_{,t})))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the conventional ud reward is a natural `` naive '' choice for the agents reward ; the total reward on each night gets uniformly divided among the agents attending that night .",
    "if we take @xmath361 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath33 s utility is an undiscounted sum of its rewards ) , then for the ud reward @xmath362 , so that the system is weakly trivial .",
    "the original version of the bar problem in the physics literature  @xcite is the special case where ud reward is used but there are only two `` nights '' in the week ( one of which corresponds to `` staying at home '' ) ; @xmath354 is uniform ; and @xmath363 for some vector @xmath364 , taken to equal ( .6 , .4 ) in the very original papers .",
    "so the reward to agent @xmath33 is 1 if it attends the bar and attendance is below capacity , or if it stays at home and the bar is over capacity .",
    "reward is 0 otherwise .",
    "( in addition , unlike in our coin - based systems , in the original work on the bar problem the microlearners work by explicitly predicting the bar attendance , rather than by directly modifying behavior to try to increase a reward signal . )",
    "in contrast to the ud reward , providing the g reward at time @xmath17 to each agent results in all agents receiving the same reward .",
    "this is the team game reward function , investigated for example in  @xcite . for this reward function ,",
    "the system is automatically factored if we define @xmath365 .",
    "however , evaluation of this reward function requires centralized communication concerning all seven nights .",
    "furthermore , given that there are 168 agents , g is likely to have poor learnability as a reward for any individual agent .",
    "this latter problem is obviated by using the wl reward , where the subtraction of the clamped term removes some of the `` noise '' of the activity of all other agents , leaving only the underlying `` signal '' of how the agent in question affects the utility .",
    "so one would expect that with the wl reward the agents can readily discern the effects of their actions on their rewards .",
    "even though the conditions in coroll",
    ". 1 do nt hold elements of @xmath366 are just @xmath367 , but the contributions of @xmath368 to @xmath78 can not be written as a sum of a @xmath367 contribution and a @xmath369 contribution . ] , this reasoning accords with the implicit advice of coroll . 1 under the approximation of the @xmath162 effect set as @xmath370 .",
    "in other words , it agrees with that corollary s implicit advice under the identification of @xmath371 as @xmath33 s @xmath122 guessed effect set .",
    "in fact , in this very simple system , we can explicitly calculate the ratio of the wl reward s learnability to that of the g reward , by recasting the system as existing for only a single instant so that @xmath372 exactly and then applying thm .",
    "so for example , say that all @xmath373 , and that the number of nodes @xmath344 is evenly divided among the seven nights .",
    "the numerator term in thm .",
    "3 is a vector whose components are some of the partials of g evaluated when @xmath374 .",
    "this vector is @xmath375 dimensional , one dimension for each of the 7 components of ( the unary vector comprising ) each node in @xmath152 . for any particular @xmath302 and night @xmath4 , the associated partial",
    "derivative is @xmath376 $ ] , where as usual `` @xmath377 '' indicates the @xmath4th component of the unary vector @xmath378 .",
    "since @xmath379 , for any fixed @xmath4 and @xmath53 , this sum just equals @xmath380 .",
    "since there are @xmath375 such terms , after taking the norm we obtain @xmath381 \\ ; \\sqrt{7(n-1})|$ ] .    the denominator term in thm .",
    "3 is the difference between the gradients of the global reward and the clamped reward .",
    "these differ on only @xmath382 terms , one term for that component of each node @xmath302 corresponding to the night @xmath33 attends .",
    "( the other @xmath383 terms are identical in the two partials and therefore cancel . )",
    "this yields @xmath381 \\ ; [ 1 - e^{1/c } ( 1 - \\frac{7}{n-7c } ) ] \\ ; \\sqrt{n-1}$ ] . combining with the result of the previous paragraph ,",
    "our ratio is @xmath384 .",
    "in addition to this learnability advantage of the wl reward , to evaluate its wl reward each agent only needs to know the total attendance on the night it attended , so no centralized communication is required .",
    "finally , although the system wo nt be perfectly factored for this reward ( since in fact the effect set of @xmath33 s action at @xmath17 would be expected to extend a bit beyond @xmath31 ) , one might expect that it is close enough to being factored to result in large world utility .",
    "each agent keeps a seven dimensional euclidean vector representing its estimate of the reward for attending each night of the week . at the end of each week ,",
    "the component of this vector corresponding to the night just attended is proportionally adjusted towards the actual reward just received . at the beginning of the succeeding week",
    ", the agent picks the night to attend using a boltzmann distribution with energies given by the components of the vector of estimated rewards , where the temperature in the boltzmann distribution decays in time .",
    "( this learning algorithm is equivalent to claus and boutilier s  @xcite independent learner algorithm for multi - agent reinforcement learning . )",
    "we used the same parameters ( learning rate , boltzmann temperature , decay rates , etc . ) for all three reward functions .",
    "( this is an _ extremely _ primitive rl algorithm which we only chose for its pedagogical value ; more sophisticated rl algorithms are crucial for eliciting high intelligence levels when one is confronted with more complicated learning problems . )",
    "figure  [ fig : barfig ] presents world reward values as a function of time , averaged over 50 separate runs , for all three reward functions , for both @xmath355 $ ] and @xmath356 $ ] .",
    "the behavior with the g reward eventually converges to the global optimum .",
    "this is in agreement with the results obtained by crites  @xcite for the bank of elevators control problem .",
    "systems using the wl reward also converged to optimal performance .",
    "this indicates that for the bar problem our approximations of effects sets are sufficiently accurate , _",
    "i.e. _ , that ignoring the effects one agent s actions will have on future actions of other agents does not significantly diminish performance .",
    "this reflects the fact that the only interactions between agents occurs indirectly , via their affecting each others reward values .",
    "however since the wl reward is more learnable than than the g reward , convergence with the wl reward should be far quicker than with the g reward .",
    "indeed , when @xmath356 $ ] , systems using the g reward converge in 1250 weeks , which is 5 times worse than the systems using wl reward .",
    "when @xmath355 $ ] systems take 6500 weeks to converge with the g reward , which is more than _ 30 times _ worse than the time with the wl reward .",
    "in contrast to the behavior for reward functions based on our coin framework , use of the conventional ud reward results in very poor world reward values , values that deteriorated as the learning progressed .",
    "this is an instance of the toc .",
    "for example , for the case where @xmath356 $ ] , it is in every agent s interest to attend the same night  but their doing so shrinks the world reward `` pie '' that must be divided among all agents .",
    "a similar toc occurs when @xmath354 is uniform .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : attend ] which shows a typical example of daily attendance figures ( \\{@xmath385 } ) for each of the three reward functions for @xmath386 . in this example optimal performance",
    "( achieved with the wl reward ) has 6 agents each on 6 separate nights , ( thus maximizing the reward on 6 nights ) , and the remaining 132 agents on one night .",
    "figure  [ fig : numagents ] shows how @xmath387 performance scales with @xmath344 for each of the reward signals for @xmath356 $ ] .",
    "systems using the ud reward perform poorly regardless of @xmath344 .",
    "systems using the g reward perform well when @xmath344 is low . as @xmath344 increases however",
    ", it becomes increasingly difficult for the agents to extract the information they need from the g reward .",
    "( this problem is significantly worse for uniform @xmath354 . ) because of their superior learnability , systems using the wl reward overcome this signal - to - noise problem ( _ i.e. _ , because the wl reward is based on the _ difference _ between the actual state and the state where one agent is clamped , it is much less affected by the total number of agents ) .      in the experiments recounted above",
    ", the agents were sufficiently independent that assuming they did not affect each other s actions ( when forming guesses for effect sets ) allowed the resultant wl reward signals to result in optimal performance . in this section",
    "we investigate the contrasting situation where we have initial guesses of effect sets that are quite poor and that therefore result in bad global performance when used with wl rewards .",
    "in particular , we investigate the use of macrolearning to correct those guessed effect sets at run - time , so that with the corrected guessed effect sets wl rewards will instead give optimal performance .",
    "this models real - world scenarios where the system designer s initial guessed effect sets are poor approximations of the actual associated effect sets and need to be corrected adaptively .    in these experiments",
    "the bar problem is significantly modified to incorporate constraints designed to result in poor @xmath78 when the wl reward is used with certain initial guessed effect sets . to do this",
    "we forced the nights actually attended by some of the agents ( followers ) to agree with those attended by other agents ( leaders ) , regardless of what night those followers `` picked '' via their microlearning algorithms .",
    "( for leaders , picked and actually attended nights were always the same . )",
    "we then had the world utility be the sum , over all leaders , of the values of a triply - indexed reward matrix whose indices are the nights that each leader - follower set attends : @xmath388 where @xmath389 is the night the @xmath390 leader attends in week @xmath17 , and @xmath391 and @xmath392 are the nights attended by the followers of leader @xmath4 , in week @xmath17 ( in this study , each leader has two followers ) .",
    "we also had the states of each node be one of the integers \\{0 , 1 , ... , 6 } rather than ( as in the bar problem ) a unary seven - dimensional vector .",
    "this was a bit of a contrivance , since constructions like @xmath393 are nt meaningful for such essentially symbolic interpretations of the possible states @xmath103 .",
    "as elaborated below , though , it was helpful for constructing a scenario in which guessed effect set wlu results in poor performance , _ i.e. _ , a scenario in which we can explore the application of macrolearning .    to see how this setup can result in poor world utility , first note that the system s dynamics is what restricts all the members of each triple @xmath394 to equal the night picked by leader @xmath4 for week",
    "so @xmath395 and @xmath392 are both in leader @xmath4 s actual effect set at week @xmath17  whereas the initial guess for @xmath4 s effect set may or may not contain nodes other than @xmath389 .",
    "( for example , in the bar problem experiments , the guessed effect set does not contain any nodes beyond @xmath389 . ) on the other hand , @xmath78 and @xmath222 are defined for all possible triples ( @xmath396 ) .",
    "so in particular , @xmath222 is defined for the dynamically unrealizable triples that can arise in the clamping operation .",
    "this fact , combined with the leader - follower dynamics , means that for certain @xmath222 s there exist guessed effect sets such that the dynamics assures poor world utility when the associated wl rewards are used .",
    "this is precisely the type of problem that macrolearning is designed to correct .    as an example , say each week only contains two nights , 0 and 1 .",
    "set @xmath397 and @xmath398 .",
    "so the contribution to @xmath78 when a leader picks night 1 is 1 , and when that leader picks night 0 it is 0 , independent of the picks of that leader s followers ( since the actual nights they attend are determined by their leader s picks ) .",
    "accordingly , we want to have a private utility for each leader that will induce that leader to pick night 1 .",
    "now if a leader s guessed effect set includes both of its followers ( in addition to the leader itself ) , then clamping all elements in its effect set to 0 results in an @xmath222 value of @xmath398 .",
    "therefore the associated guessed effect set wlu will reward the leader for choosing night 1 , which is what we want .",
    "( for this case wl reward equals @xmath399 if the leader picks night 1 , compared to reward @xmath400 for picking night 0 . )",
    "however consider having two leaders , @xmath401 and @xmath402 , where @xmath401 s guessed effect set consists of @xmath401 itself together with the two followers of @xmath402 ( rather than together with the two followers of @xmath401 itself ) .",
    "so neither of leader @xmath401 s followers are in its guessed effect set , while @xmath401 itself is .",
    "accordingly , the three indices to @xmath401 s @xmath222 need not have the same value .",
    "similarly , clamping the nodes in its guessed effect set wo nt affect the values of the second and third indices to @xmath401 s @xmath222 , since the values of those indices are set by @xmath401 s followers .",
    "so for example , if @xmath402 and its two followers go to night 0 in week 0 , and @xmath401 and its two followers go to night 1 in that week , then the associated guessed effect set wonderful life reward for @xmath401 for week 0 is @xmath403 $ ] .",
    "this equals @xmath404 . simply by setting @xmath405",
    "we can ensure that this is negative .",
    "conversely , if leader @xmath401 had gone to night 0 , its guessed effect wlu would have been 0 .",
    "so in this situation leader @xmath401 will get a greater reward for going to night 0 than for going to night 1 .",
    "in this situation , leader @xmath401 s using its guessed effect set wlu will lead it to make the wrong pick .    to investigate the efficacy of the macrolearning , two sets of separate experiments were conducted . in the first one the reward matrix @xmath222",
    "was chosen so that if each leader is maximizing its wl reward , but for guessed effect sets that contain none of its followers , then the system evolves to @xmath406 world reward .",
    "so if a leader incorrectly guesses that some @xmath269 is its effect set even though @xmath269 does nt contain both of that leader s followers , and if this is true for all leaders , then we are assured of worst possible performance . in the second set of experiments , we investigated the efficacy of macrolearning for a broader spectrum of reward matrices by generating those matrices randomly .",
    "we call these two kinds of reward matrices _ worst - case _ and _ random _ reward matrices , respectively . in both cases , if it can modify the initial guessed effect sets of the leaders to include their followers , then macrolearning will induce the system to be factored .",
    "the microlearning in these experiments was the same as in the bar problem .",
    "all experiments used the wl personal reward with some ( initially random ) guessed effect set .",
    "when macrolearning was used , it was implemented starting after the microlearning had run for a specified number of weeks .",
    "the macrolearner worked by estimating the correlations between the agents selections of which nights to attend .",
    "it did this by examining the attendances of the agents over the preceding weeks .",
    "given those estimates , for each agent @xmath33 the two agents whose attendances were estimated to be the most correlated with those of agent @xmath33 were put into agent @xmath33 s guessed effect set . of course , none of this macrolearning had any effect on global performance when applied to follower agents , but the macrolearning algorithm can not know that ahead of time ; it applied this procedure to each and every agent in the system .",
    "figure  [ fig : worstreward ] presents averages over 50 runs of world reward as a function of weeks using the worst - case reward matrix . for comparison purposes , in both plots the top curve represents the case where the followers are in their leader",
    "s guessed effect sets .",
    "the bottom curve in both plots represents the other extreme where no leader s guessed effect set contains either of its followers . in both plots ,",
    "the middle curve is performance when the leaders guessed effect sets are initially random , both with ( right ) and without ( left ) macrolearning turned on at week 500 .",
    "the performance for random guessed effect sets differs only slightly from that of having leaders guessed effect sets contain none of their followers ; both start with poor values of world reward that deteriorates with time .",
    "however , when macrolearning is performed on systems with initially random guessed effect sets , the system quickly rectifies itself and converges to optimal performance .",
    "this is reflected by the sudden vertical jump through the middle of the right plot at 500 weeks , the point at which macrolearning changed the guessed effect sets . by changing those guessed effect sets macrolearning results in a system that is factored for the associated wl reward function , so that those reward functions quickly induced the maximal possible world reward .",
    "figure  [ fig : randomreward ] presents performance averaged over 50 runs for world reward as a function of weeks using a spectrum of reward matrices selected at random .",
    "the ordering of the plots is exactly as in figure  [ fig : worstreward ] .",
    "macrolearning is applied at 2000 weeks , in the right plot .",
    "the simulations in figure  [ fig : randomreward ] were lengthened from those in figure  [ fig : worstreward ] because the convergence time of the full spectrum of reward matrices case was longer .    in figure",
    "[ fig : randomreward ] the macrolearning resulted in a transient degradation in performance at 2000 weeks followed by convergence to the optimal . without macrolearning the system s performance",
    "no longer varied after 2000 weeks .",
    "combined with the results presented in figure  [ fig : worstreward ] , these experiments demonstrate that macrolearning induces optimal performance by aligning the agents guessed effect sets with those agents that they actually do influence the most .",
    "many distributed computational tasks can not be addressed by direct modeling of the underlying dynamics , or are at best poorly addressed that way due to robustness and scalability concerns .",
    "such tasks should instead be addressed by model - independent machine learning techniques . in particular ,",
    "reinforcement learning ( rl ) techniques are often a natural choice for how to address such tasks .",
    "when  as is often the case  we can not rely on centralized control and communication , such rl algorithms have to be deployed locally , throughout the system .",
    "this raises the important and profound question of how to configure those algorithms , and especially their associated utility functions , so as to achieve the ( global ) computational task .",
    "in particular we must ensure that the rl algorithms do not `` work at cross - purposes '' as far as the global task is concerned , lest phenomena like tragedy of the commons occur .",
    "how to initialize a system to do this is a novel kind of inverse problem , and how to adapt a system at run - time to better achieve such a global task is a novel kind of learning problem .",
    "we call any distributed computational system analyzed from the perspective of such an inverse problem a collective intelligence ( coin ) .    as discussed in the literature review section of this chapter , there are many approaches / fields that address aspects of coins .",
    "these range from multi - agent systems through conventional economics and on to computational economics .",
    "( human economies are a canonical model of a functional coin . )",
    "they range onward to game theory , various aspects of distributed biological systems , and on through physics , active walker models , and recurrent neural nets . unfortunately",
    ", none of these fields seems appropriate as a general approach to understanding coins .",
    "after this literature review we present a mathematical theory for coins . we then present experiments on two test problems that validate the predictions of that theory for how best to design a coin to achieve a global computational task .",
    "the first set of experiments involves a variant of arthur s famous el farol bar problem .",
    "the second set instead considers a leader - follower problem that is hand - designed to cause maximal difficulty for the advice of our theory on how to initialize a coin .",
    "this second set of experiments is therefore a test of the on - line learning aspect of our approach to coins . in both experiments the procedures derived from our theory , procedures using only local information , vastly outperformed natural alternative approaches , even such approaches that exploited global information .",
    "indeed , in both problems , following the theory summarized in this chapter provides good solutions even when the exact conditions required by the associated theorems hold only approximately .",
    "there are many directions in which future work on coins will proceed ; it is a vast and rich area of research .",
    "we are already successfully applying our current understanding of coins , tentative as it is , to internet packet routing problems .",
    "we are also investigating coins in a more general optimization context where economics - inspired market mechanisms are used to guide some of the interactions among the agents of the distributed system .",
    "the goal in this second body of work is to parallelize and solve numerical optimization problems where the concept of an `` agent '' may not be in the natural definition of the problem .",
    "we also intend to try to apply our current coin framework to the problem of designing high - occupancy toll lanes in vehicular traffic , and to help understand the `` design space '' necessary for distributed biochemical entities like pre - genomic cells .",
