    "since the late 1930s the solar corona has been known to be much hotter than the photosphere , although the latter delineates the surface through which energy enters the corona .",
    "the corona is thus not in a state of simple heat flow equilibrium , and its high temperature must be supplied with some form of mechanical , electrical or radiative work which is dissipated at coronal heights .",
    "several heating mechanisms have been proposed , such as alfvn @xcite or ion cyclotron @xcite waves , or electric currents @xcite and magnetic reconnection @xcite converting magnetic shear into jets , and , ultimately , into heat .",
    "some of these processes operate in a continuous mode , whereas others invoke transients .",
    "comprehensive reviews may be found , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    with increasing sensitivity of the observations it was recognized that the ` quiet ' solar corona contains in fact ` microflares ' and ` nanoflares ' down to the actual resolution limit .",
    "clearly , these events are the signature of non - equilibrium processes , and therefore represent promising candidates for the primary heating mechanism of the solar corona @xcite .    stars at high magnetic activity levels show properties that are reminiscent of continuous flaring processes , such as persistent coronal temperatures of 530 mk , high coronal electron densities , or continuous non - thermal radio emission .",
    "see @xcite for a summary of observational results .",
    "foremostly , x - ray and extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) time series of such stars reveal a high level of flux variability on time scales similar to flares @xcite .",
    "limited detector sensitivity could give the wrong impression that the emission is due to steadily emitting coronal sources , while new , highly sensitive observations in at least some cases show little indication of a base level emission that could be defined as being genuinely ` quiescent ' @xcite . a coronal heating mechanism that should successfully explain x - ray and euv emission from magnetically active stars inevitably has to address the question of continuous variability .",
    "in the context of microflare heating one is interested in the frequency distribution of flare amplitudes .",
    "in particular , it is essential to have reliable estimators of the small but frequent flares , since these presumably carry a major part of the total energy .",
    "however , these small flares substantially overlap , so that their amplitudes are hard to determine from the noisy observations . one way out is to use flare identification algorithms that also include flare superposition @xcite .",
    "another way out is to resort to a forward model , which constrains the flare amplitude distribution by model assumptions . within a monte carlo framework",
    ", this approach has been followed by @xcite and in @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we explore _ analytical _ forward methods .",
    "we describe a statistical model of superimposed flares which provides an exact relation between the ( univariate ) probability density of the flare amplitudes and the ( univariate ) probability densities of the observed binned count rates and photon waiting times .",
    "as the method involves the histograms of binned count rates and photon waiting times only , it is insensitive to permutation of the time bins and to the presence of long data gaps .",
    "the price for this robustness is the loss of temporal information , which is replaced by the assumption that all flares have similar shape and occur at random .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a complementary approach focusing on the temporal autocorrelation of the light curves ( and thus on the first two moments of the univariate count rate distribution ) .    in what follows",
    "we basically work with the observables ` counts ' and ` count rates ' , with emphasis on the effect of flare superposition and counting noise .",
    "the conversion into luminosity and flare energy is briefly discussed in section [ discussion_sect ] .",
    "while the energy release and relaxation processes are not known in detail , there is observational support for the similarity of flares on a global scale  at least for ` simple ' flares .",
    "stellar flares of the type investigated in this paper can usually well be represented by a sharp rise and an exponential decay .",
    "examples supporting this view are found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the observed durations of flares , as investigated in the solar case , are almost independent of the flare amplitude or radiated energy even if 3 - 5 observed orders of magnitude are included .",
    "( @xcite , see also summary in @xcite ) .",
    "the decay times of flares studied below were found to scatter around a constant value in @xcite , independent of peak flux . since in stellar observations",
    "3 orders of magnitude of flare energy are usually sufficient to explain the observed emission , we shall assume that a constant decay time is a good approximation for our case as well . for completeness , the case of a weak dependence of the decay time scale @xmath15 on radiated total energy @xmath16 , @xmath17 as suggested by one stellar investigation , was studied in both @xcite and @xcite , with the result that the main conclusions on the importance of small flares were reinforced",
    ". observations also suggest that individual flares occur at random and independently of each other ( for the solar case , see @xcite ) .",
    "this independence might suggest that flares trigger an exhaustive ` reset ' where mechanical stress ( and thus memory ) is completely destroyed .",

    "the observed counts are supposed to be a poisson process with time - varying intensity @xmath27 .",
    "such a non - uniform poisson process is not unambiguously defined , and we use here the construction shown in fig . [ poissonprocess_fig ] : the photon arrival times are distributed like the @xmath28-components of uniformly distributed points @xmath29 in the @xmath30-plane satisfying @xmath31 .",

    "when binned in time bins of duration @xmath0 , the counts are poisson distributed with parameter ( = expected number of counts in @xmath0 )    @xmath32    alternatively , we may work with the photon event list . in this case",
    "we consider the time intervals between consecutive photon arrivals ( ` photon waiting times ' ) .",
    "dimensional analysis shows that the flare - related part of the signal ( [ model ] ) is governed by the single dimensionless parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the conversion into discrete time bins involves a second dimensionless parameter , @xmath34 ( or , alternatively , @xmath35 ) .",
    "if the peaks are well - separated ( @xmath36 ) and counting noise is low , one can directly estimate the flare amplitudes from the observed peaks in the light curve . if flares overlap ( @xmath37 ) or counting noise is relevant , this is no longer possible .",
    "we resort then to the model ( [ model ] ) and ask for its predictions on the observed probability densities of binned counts @xmath7 and photon waiting times @xmath10 , which are available with high accuracy under stationary conditions .",
    "the goal is thus to establish the relation between @xmath25 on the one hand , and @xmath7 and @xmath10 on the other hand .",
    "the linearity of equation ( [ model ] ) , together with the statistical independence of its ingredients , suggests that a rigorous mapping from @xmath25 to @xmath7 and @xmath10 should exist .",

    "the method uses either binned count light curves or the distribution of waiting times derived from photon lists .",
    "we have in particular considered flare shapes described by a one - sided exponential decay or a two - sided exponential profile , and we have studied flare amplitude distributions described by an exponential function and a truncated power law . the latter form has been favored in previous studies because solar flare statistics has revealed power - law distributions over a wide range in energy @xcite ; explicit stellar studies indicate power laws as well @xcite . we have thus used a power law to model euve / ds observations of ad leo , where we find a power law index of @xmath160 = 2.3 @xmath14 0.1 , a lower cutoff of @xmath210 = 0.004 @xmath14 0.002 ct  @xmath202 , and that there are @xmath33 = 15 @xmath14 8 flares per flare duration above @xmath210 ; these values are compilations of the binned count- and photon waiting time results .",
    "our results agree with complementary numerical methods recently applied to similar data sets @xcite indicating power - law indices for the flare amplitude distribution of typically 2.0  2.4 , with most measurements concentrating around @xmath160 = 2.2  2.3 .",
    "while such values are necessary for power - law flare amplitude distributions to ` explain ' coronal heating on active stars , they are not sufficient .",
    "the emitted power observed from magnetically active coronae can only be due to the ensemble of flares _ if _ the power - law distribution extends to sufficiently low energies ; this conjecture is of course difficult to prove due to the strong superposition of near - simultaneous flares that can not be separated spatially , thus forming a pseudo - continuous emission level . when expressed in terms of flare energy , our numerical results ( eqns .",
    "[ results_d ] , [ results_c ] ) correspond to a flare peak luminosity and minimum flare energy of @xmath248 where it is assumed that one euve / ds count corresponds to @xmath249 erg emitted at ad leo ( see @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , a fraction of the observed emission may be truly steady ( or variable on time scales much longer than flare time scales ) , but this level should then be below the lowest level seen in light curves between individual detected flares ; @xcite estimate that a mere 30% ( or less ) of the low - level emission of the dme ( binary ) star uv ceti could be ascribed to quasi - steady emission , the rest being recorded as variable on time scales of tens of minutes with shapes indicating continuous flaring .",
    "additional information contained in the differential emission measure distribution could help interpreting the physical processes participating in the heating of the coronal plasma @xcite .    as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "a few words of caution are in order .",
    "a number of features can not be recognized in the data per se and would require additional information .",
    "specifically , the observations collect emission from across the visible hemisphere of the star , although heating mechanisms or , in our picture , flare amplitude distributions , may vary across various coronal structures ; further , some of the variability may be introduced by intrinsic changes in the large - scale magnetic field distributions ; emerging or disappearing active regions will certainly contribute to variability , as do changes in the visibility of individual regions on the star as they move into or out of sight due to the star s rotation .",
    "nevertheless , the light curve characteristics do not appear to be dominated by any of these longer - term effects , while variability on flare time scales is ubiquitous ; similar conclusions were drawn by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the present study further supports the view that stochastic flaring is of principal importance to coronae of magnetically active stars , and that coronae of such stars may significantly , if not entirely , be heated by flares .",
    "a practical benefit of the analytical method lies in its efficient assessment of the compatibility of model and observations .",
    "the computation of @xmath235 for a given set of parameters takes milliseconds on a medium - size work station , while a monte carlo simulation of comparable accuracy takes seconds or minutes due to slow ( @xmath250 ) convergence at rare large flares .",
    "the efficiency of the analytical approach allows to systematically explore the whole parameter space for the global chi square minimum .",
    "for instance , figure [ euve_chi2_fig ] has been obtained by a brute - force calculation of @xmath251 on a cubic lattice of dimension 90@xmath25295@xmath252100 , taking about one hour computation time , whereas a similar monte carlo simulation would take many weeks .",
    "the possibility for systematic exploration of the parameter space ( at low resolution ) is important because the chi square function has generally several local minima , so that traditional minimization routines such as conjugate gradients may fail .",
    "note that the simple contours of figure [ euve_chi2_fig ] depict only the local behavior around the global minimum .",
    "when comparing the binned counts- and photon waiting time methods it was found that the binned counts method has larger confidence domains than the photon waiting time method , but is also more robust in finding the global minimum .",
    "a good strategy is thus to start with the binned counts , using a low - resolution exploration of the parameter space .",
    "as soon as a the approximate global chi square minimum is found , this may be refined by the photon waiting time method . in any case",
    "the final solutions should be cross - checked for both methods , to ensure consistency and to obtain an error estimate for the parameters which goes beyond the errors of the separate methods .",
    "we would finally stress that our analytical method is in no way restricted to the particular time series studied in this paper .",
    "the method applies whenever the process can be described in the form of equation ( [ model ] ) , which may include models for so divers phenomena as cataclysmic variables , gamma ray burst substructures , and x ray binaries .",
    "there is also no need to restrict the process ( [ model ] ) a the real line ( see below ) .",
    "a drawback of the analytical method , compared to monte carlo simulations , is its limited capability to incorporate systematic instrumental artifacts .",
    "we close by mentioning a few straight forward extensions of the model ( eq . [ model ] ) .",
    "* flare clustering . *",
    "the assumption of independent flare times might be questionable in the light of more advanced avalanche models @xcite where flares may trigger each other .",
    "flare clustering can be accounted for by a flare waiting time distribution which does not create uniform flare times ( @xmath253 ) , but has a long - range tail permitting rare but large jumps .",
    "the ` clusters ' are between the jumps .",
    "if the flare amplitudes are still independently @xmath58-distributed , rise immediately and decay exponentially , then the functional equation ( [ phi_eq ] ) for the peak values still holds , but the separation into the form ( [ int_eq ] ) is no longer possible .",

    "<S> we study the hypothesis that observed x - ray / extreme ultraviolet emission from coronae of magnetically active stars is entirely ( or to a large part ) due to the superposition of flares , using an analytic approach to determine the amplitude distribution of flares in light curves . </S>",
    "<S> the flare - heating hypothesis is motivated by time series that show continuous variability suggesting the presence of a large number of superimposed flares with similar rise and decay time scales . </S>",
    "<S> we rigorously relate the amplitude distribution of stellar flares to the observed histograms of binned counts and photon waiting times , under the assumption that the flares occur at random and have similar shapes . </S>",
    "<S> our main results are : ( 1 ) the characteristic function ( fourier transform of the probability density ) of the expected counts in time bins @xmath0 is @xmath1 = @xmath2 \\}$ ] , where @xmath3 is the mean flaring interval , @xmath4 is the characteristic function of the flare amplitudes , and @xmath5 is the flare shape convolved with the observational time bin . ( 2 ) the probability of finding @xmath6 counts in time bins @xmath0 is @xmath7 = @xmath8 . ( 3 ) the probability density of photon waiting times @xmath9 is @xmath10 = @xmath11 with @xmath12 = @xmath13 the mean count rate . </S>",
    "<S> an additive independent background is readily included . applying these results to euve / ds observations of the flaring star ad leo , we find that the flare amplitude distribution can be represented by a truncated power law with a power law index of 2.3 @xmath14 0.1 . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical results agree with existing monte carlo results of @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applicable to a wide range of further stochastically bursting astrophysical sources such as cataclysmic variables , gamma ray burst substructures , x - ray binaries , and spatially resolved observations of solar flares . </S>"
