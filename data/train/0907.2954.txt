    "the notion of simplicial collapse , introduced by j.h.c .",
    "whitehead in the late thirties @xcite , is a fundamental tool in algebraic topology and in combinatorial geometry @xcite .",
    "collapsible polyhedra are the centre of various famous problems , perhaps the most relevant of them being the zeeman conjecture @xcite .",
    "although an elementary simplicial collapse is very simple to describe , it is not easy to determine whether a simplicial complex is collapsible . in fact , the zeeman conjecture , which states that @xmath1 is collapsible for any contractible polyhedron @xmath2 of dimension @xmath3 , is still an open problem .",
    "one of the main difficulties when studying collapsibility , or simple homotopy theory in general , is the non - uniqueness of what we call _ cores .",
    "a _ core _ of a complex @xmath2 , in this setting , is a minimal element in the poset of all subcomplexes which expand to @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , there exist collapsible complexes which collapse to nontrivial subcomplexes with no free faces . _",
    "in this article we introduce and develope the theory of strong homotopy types of simplicial complexes , which has interesting applications to problems of collapsibility .",
    "similarly to the case of simple homotopy types , the strong homotopy types can be described in terms of elementary moves .",
    "a vertex @xmath4 of a simplicial complex @xmath2 is called _ dominated if its link is a simplicial cone .",
    "an elementary strong collapse @xmath5 consists of removing from a simplicial complex @xmath2 the open star of a dominated vertex @xmath4 .",
    "surprisingly the notion of strong homotopy equivalence also arises from the concept of contiguity classes .",
    "it is not hard to see that a strong collapse is a particular case of a classical collapse .",
    "this new kind of collapse is much easier to handle for various reasons : the existence and uniqueness of cores , the fact that strong homotopy equivalences between _ minimal complexes are isomorphisms and the relationship between this theory and the _ nerves of the complexes .",
    "a finite simplicial complex @xmath2 is minimal if it has no dominated vertices and a core of a finite simplicial complex @xmath2 in this context is a minimal subcomplex @xmath6 such that @xmath7 .",
    "minimal complexes appeared already in the literature under the name of _ taut complexes @xcite .",
    "b. grnbaum investigated the relationship between minimal complexes and nerves , but apparently he was unaware of the significant relationship between these notions and collapsibility .",
    "we will show that , in contrast to the classical situation , in this context all the cores of a complex @xmath2 are isomorphic and one can reach the core of a complex by iterating the nerve operation .",
    "this provides a new method to study collapsibility from a different viewpoint . _",
    "_ _ _    in order to investigate the difference between simplicial collapses and strong collapses , in section [ eva ] we relax the notion of strong collapse and define inductively divers notions of collapses which lie between the two concepts . in this way",
    ", the notion of non - evasiveness appears naturally in our context .",
    "the concept of non - evasiveness , commonly used in combinatorics and combinatorial geometry , is motivated by problems in graph theory @xcite . a non - evasive simplicial complex is collapsible ( in the classical sense ) but",
    "the converse is not true .",
    "our approach is slightly different from the previous treatments of this subject , since we are more interested in understanding the difference between the various notions of collapses from a geometric point of view .",
    "one of the most significant questions related to this concept is the so - called _ evasiveness conjecture for simplicial complexes which asserts that a non - evasive simplicial complex endowed with a vertex - transitive action of some group @xmath0 is a simplex .",
    "the conjecture is still open for non - evasive complexes but it is known to be false for collapsible complexes in general @xcite . _",
    "a simplicial complex @xmath2 is vertex - homogeneous if for any pair of vertices @xmath8 , there exists an automorphism @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "we will show that a strong collapsible complex which is vertex - homogeneous is a simplex .",
    "this proves a particular case of the evasiveness conjecture mentioned above and sheds some light on the general situation .",
    "moreover , we will see that the square nerve @xmath11 of any vertex - homogeneous complex @xmath2 is its core and that any vertex - homogeneous complex is isomorphic to an @xmath12-th multiple of its core . as an easy and direct consequence of these results , one obtains that any vertex - homogeneous complex with a prime number of vertices is minimal or a simplex .",
    "one of the main results that we prove in this direction asserts that the core of a vertex - homogeneous and non - evasive complex is also vertex - homogeneous and non - evasive . in view of this result , one derives that the study of the evasiveness conjecture for simplicial complexes can be reduced to the class of minimal ( and non - evasive ) complexes .",
    "the theory of strong homotopy types for polyhedra is motivated by the homotopy theory of finite topological spaces .",
    "one can associate to any finite simplicial complex @xmath2 , a finite @xmath13-space @xmath14 which corresponds to the poset of simplices of @xmath2 .",
    "conversely , one can associate to a given finite @xmath13-space @xmath15 the simplicial complex @xmath16 of its non - empty chains . in @xcite",
    "we have introduced the notion of collapse in the setting of finite spaces and proved that a collapse @xmath17 between finite spaces induces a collapse @xmath18 between their associated simplicial complexes and a simplicial collapse @xmath19 induces a collapse between the associated finite spaces .",
    "one advantage of working with finite spaces is that the elementary collapses in this context are very simple to handle and describe : they consist of removing a single point of the space , which is called a _ weak point . in this paper",
    "we extend these results to the non - evasive case and the strong homotopy case .",
    "we define the notion of non - evasive collapse in the setting of finite spaces and prove that this notion corresponds exactly to its simplicial version by means of the functors @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "analogously we prove that the concept of strong homotopy equivalence in the simplicial context corresponds to the notion of homotopy equivalence in the setting of finite spaces .",
    "we use these results on finite spaces to derive results on polyhedra : we prove that a simplicial complex @xmath2 is strong collapsible if and only if its barycentric subdivsion @xmath22 is strong collapsible and that the join @xmath23 of two simplicial complexes is strong collapsible if and only if @xmath2 or @xmath24 is strong collapsible . as another direct consequence of our results",
    "one can easily deduce a stronger version of a known result of v. welker on the barycentric subdivision of collapsible complexes @xcite .",
    "indeed , we show that a simplicial collapse @xmath25 determines a @xmath26-collapse @xmath27 . in particular",
    "if @xmath2 is collapsible , @xmath22 is @xmath26-collapsible and therefore non - evasive .",
    "the converse of this result is still an open problem but it holds in the case that @xmath22 is strong collapsible . _",
    "we recall the notion of contiguity classes of simplicial maps . a standard reference for this",
    "is @xcite .",
    "two simplicial maps @xmath28 are said to be _ contiguous _ if @xmath29 is a simplex of @xmath24 for every @xmath30 .",

    "contiguity classes_. contiguous maps are homotopic at the level of geometric realizations , but this notion is strictly stronger than usual homotopy .",
