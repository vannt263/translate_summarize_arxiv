    "surfaces and interfaces of oxides have been of growing interest , partially because of the rich variety of bulk oxide functionalities @xcite , as well as their unique reconstruction mechanisms @xcite not found in conventional semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the observation of metallic interfaces between two perovskite insulators , laalo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 @xcite , has motivated many studies on the origin of this conductivity .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed , one based on electronic reconstructions driven by the polar discontinuity at the interface @xcite , and another based on growth induced oxygen vacancies @xcite .",
    "the polar discontinuity scenario examines the built - in charge structure at the interface . from an ionic point of view , laalo@xmath0 is polar along the ( 001 ) direction with alternate stacking of ( lao)@xmath2 and ( alo@xmath1)@xmath3 layers , while srtio@xmath0 is non - polar with ( sro)@xmath4 and ( tio@xmath1)@xmath4 layers .",
    "when one unit cell ( uc ) of laalo@xmath0 is placed on srtio@xmath0 , there is a dipole shift in the electrostatic potential .",
    "additional laalo@xmath0 layers build up this dipole shift , leading to a diverging potential in the limit of infinite laalo@xmath0 thickness . to prevent this catastrophic situation , injection of @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the elementary charge ) per 2d uc",
    "is needed at the ( alo@xmath1)@xmath3-(lao)@xmath2-(tio@xmath1)@xmath4-(sro)@xmath4 interface , which can be accommodated by a partial valence change of ti@xmath7 to ti@xmath8 near the interface .",
    "the ti@xmath8 component provides mobile srtio@xmath0 conduction electrons in this picture @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed that the essential origin of the conducting interface is the formation of srtio@xmath0 surface oxygen vacancies during the highly kinetic growth of films by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) @xcite .",
    "srtio@xmath0 is known to be a material which easily accommodates oxygen vacancies that readily dope itinerant electrons @xcite .",
    "discriminating between these two proposed scenarios has been controversial , in part because both mechanisms could give similar transport and spectroscopic signatures .",
    "the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 system actually involves two polar discontinuities - the interface just described , as well as the polar alo@xmath1-terminated surface of laalo@xmath0 , which requires a net @xmath9 per 2d uc .",
    "recently it was found that the conducting laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface exhibited a transition to an insulating state when the laalo@xmath0 was thinner than a critical thickness of 4 uc , bringing the two polar discontinuities close together @xcite .",
    "( similar behavior was also observed for proximity coupling of two laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface polar discontinuities with opposite sign @xcite . )",
    "this critical thickness may be interpreted as the threshold dipole shift below which it is energetically favorable to remain in an unreconstructed state for both the surface and the interface @xcite .",
    "a different but equivalent perspective is that the polar alo@xmath1-terminated surface of laalo@xmath0 is compensating the electrons at the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface by hole - doping on short length scales . far above the critical thickness , the polar laalo@xmath0 ( 001 ) surface atomically reconstructs via surface off - stoichiometry and surface relaxation ;",
    "electronic reconstructions are unavailable because of the fixed valence of la , al , and o @xcite .",
    "below a characteristic coupling distance , however , hole - doping provides an alternative electronic reconstruction if it is energetically favorable .    in order to test this possibility of hole - doping ,",
    "we have studied the transport properties of the mott insulator lavo@xmath0 embedded in laalo@xmath0 in trilayer structures [ fig .  [ cap - fig1](a ) ] .",
    "lavo@xmath0 is an attractive candidate since it can be readily hole - doped by chemical substitution @xcite , and because of its structural and thermodynamic compatibility with laalo@xmath0 for the growth of atomically precise thin film structures .",
    "although lavo@xmath0 has the same polar structure as laalo@xmath0 , and hence no polar discontinuity at their interface , we find an exponential drop in resistance when a polar alo@xmath1-terminated surface of laalo@xmath0 is brought in close proximity to the lavo@xmath0 quantum well .",
    "furthermore , the positive thermopower voltage measured indicates hole - like carriers , which scales with the doping dependence of bulk lavo@xmath0 .",
    "these results indicate that polar discontinuities can be utilized for the tunable doping of holes , which can not arise by growth induced oxygen vacancies .",
    "laalo@xmath0 ( @xmath10 uc)/lavo@xmath0 ( @xmath11 uc)/laalo@xmath0 ( substrate ) heterostructures ( lao(@xmath10)/lvo(@xmath11 ) ) were fabricated by pld , using a krf excimer laser with a laser fluence of 1.0 j/@xmath12 , a spot size of 1.6 mm@xmath13 , and repetition rate of 8 hz .",
    "the thickness of each layer was monitored by reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) oscillations [ fig .",
    "[ cap - fig1](b ) ] .",
    "alo@xmath1-terminated laalo@xmath0 ( 001 ) single crystal substrates were preannealed at 950 @xmath14c for 30 minutes , and @xmath11 uc ( @xmath11 = 1 to 30 ) lavo@xmath0 layers were deposited , followed by @xmath10 uc ( @xmath10 = 1 to 50 ) laalo@xmath0 capping layers using lavo@xmath15 polycrystalline and laalo@xmath0 single crystal targets , respectively .",
    "the growth temperature was 600 @xmath14c and the oxygen partial pressure was 1.0 @xmath16 @xmath17 torr for all processes .",
    "these conditions follow our previous optimization of high quality lavo@xmath0 thin film growth in the layer - by - layer growth mode @xcite , with one exception . note the different laser conditions : we now use a 4 lens afocal zoom stage to accurately image an aperture , rather than a single lens just off of the focusing condition .",
    "this is far less sensitive to the divergence characteristics of the laser , and hence much more reproducible between systems .",
    "we confirmed that one rheed oscillation corresponds to the formation of one perovskite unit cell by characterizing superlattices of laalo@xmath0 and lavo@xmath0 using x - ray diffraction .",
    "the stoichiometry of lavo@xmath0 films grown in these conditions has been confirmed from several different perspectives in previous studies .",
    "the film lattice volume was found to be close to bulk ( accounting for the compressive strain by the substrate )  usually , in the presence of significant cation defects , there is significant lattice expansion of the lattice @xcite .",
    "lavo@xmath0 films were also studied extensively by scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) @xcite .",
    "the insulating lavo@xmath0 films have a clear v@xmath8 valence , as observed in the v - l@xmath18 edge .",
    "any significant doping by off - stoichiometry would have shown clear deviations from v@xmath8 spectra .",
    "thus the stoichiometry of our lavo@xmath0 films has been well established in these previous studies .",
    "laalo@xmath0/lavo@xmath0/laalo@xmath0 quantum wells could not be grown at higher oxygen partial pressures than used here , due to the competing formation of polycrystalline lav@xmath19o@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lavo@xmath0 layers in the as - grown quantum wells converted to the insulating , transparent ( @xmath20 ) lav@xmath19o@xmath15 phase upon oxygen post annealing .",
    "the film surface was investigated by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , and all structures were atomically flat with a clear step and terrace structure reflecting the slight miscut angle of the substrate [ fig .",
    "[ cap - fig1](c ) ] . the step size ( @xmath21 0.4 nm ) was consistent with the height of one laalo@xmath0 uc ( pseudocubic lattice constant @xmath22 nm ) .",
    "ohmic contacts were made to the buried quantum well layers using indium ultrasonic soldering , which penetrated more than 40 nm from the surface as confirmed using buried srvo@xmath0 test structures .",
    "the in - plane sheet resistance was dramatically dependent on the laalo@xmath0 cap thickness as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap - fig2](a ) , where the thickness of the lavo@xmath0 layer was fixed to 3 uc . below a characteristic thickness of around 10 - 15 uc , the sheet resistance decreased exponentially .",
    "for all samples the sheet resistance showed arrhenius - type thermally activated behavior as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ cap - fig2](b ) .",
    "the activation energy was @xmath23 ev for the thick capping layer samples , and decreased to @xmath24 ev with a similar characteristic thickness .",
    "since laalo@xmath0 is such a robust insulator ( both in bulk and as measured in our thin films ) , the resistance of the embedded lavo@xmath0 layer could be measured to the very high values shown .",
    "similar results were found for these lao(@xmath10)/lvo(@xmath25 ) trilayer structures further capped with a non - polar material , 10 uc of srtio@xmath0 , but measurement was limited to a lower range of resistance values ( @xmath26 ) by the higher intrinsic conductivity of srtio@xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that the conductivity of the lavo@xmath0 layer only depends on the distance to the polar surface ( laalo@xmath0 surface ) or interface ( srtio@xmath0/laalo@xmath0 ) , not on the total thickness of the material deposited on top of it .",
    "therefore , the role of lavo@xmath0 defects created during growth of the cap can be neglected here .",
    "these results are well explained by the electrostatic coupling of reconstructions of the polar surface and the quantum well , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cap - fig3 ] . since we fabricated the quantum well structures by perovskite unit cell deposition on alo@xmath1-terminated laalo@xmath0 substrates , the surface of the laalo@xmath0 cap preserves alo@xmath1-termination , which requires a net @xmath9 per 2d uc to avoid the potential divergence arising from the surface polar discontinuity . here",
    "we consider two reconstruction mechanisms for this system .",
    "the first possibility is hole injection into the lavo@xmath0 quantum well layer . in this case",
    "we have no divergence , but still a finite dipole shift @xmath27 arising from the polar laalo@xmath0 cap .",
    "thus the total energy of this electronic reconstruction is the sum of the energy cost to change the vanadium valence @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "the second process is the normal surface reconstruction of laalo@xmath0 where an atomic reconstruction is dominant ( oxygen vacancies and lattice distortions ) to provide positive charge .",
    "this reconstruction requires an energy cost @xmath29 which is nominally independent of the thickness of the cap layer .",
    "note that this is the same @xmath29 , calculated in ref .",
    "[ ] with respect to @xmath28 for ti , where the conducting laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface is toggled by manipulating the surface reconstruction .",
    "the difference in @xmath28 for ti and v leads to the different critical thickness observed in the two systems .    in the simplest form ,",
    "@xmath27 increases linearly as a function of the laalo@xmath0 cap thickness : @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the dielectric constant of laalo@xmath0 ) . if the cap is sufficiently thin ( and @xmath32 ) , then @xmath33 and hole injection is dominant , which decreases the resistance of the quantum well . on the other hand , when the cap is very thick , @xmath34 , and the surface of the laalo@xmath0 cap is reconstructed , while the lavo@xmath0 layers are undoped and insulating . between these limiting cases ,",
    "hole injection into the lavo@xmath0 layer gradually decreases and the resistance increases as a function of the cap thickness , as observed in the transport measurements . taking the laalo@xmath0 bulk dielectric constant @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the vacuum permittivity ) , @xmath37 ev , exceeding the laalo@xmath0 bulk bandgap @xmath38 ev . in the actual system this is greatly reduced by strong polarization of the laalo@xmath0 lattice as observed by surface x - ray diffraction in laalo@xmath0 thin films on srtio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thus the detailed response is far more complex than represented in fig .",
    "[ cap - fig3 ] , and the energy cost @xmath39 is likely dominated by the polarization energy of laalo@xmath0 . a further discussion of the contrast in laalo@xmath0 thickness dependence of the conductivity observed here ( conductivity in the thin limit ) , with prior results for the ( 001)-oriented laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 and lavo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interfaces @xcite ( conductivity in the thick limit ) , is given in the appendix .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ cap - fig3 ] only shows the near surface region with the lavo@xmath0 quantum well . to formally confirm that global charge neutrality is maintained for the total system in all cases of reconstructions , the structure of the bottom surface must be known",
    "this can best be illustrated in the schematic shown in fig .",
    "[ cap - fig4 ] , where we discuss only polar surfaces of laalo@xmath0 for simplicity .",
    "as is well established in surface science , the polar surfaces are unstable to reconstructions driven to keep the electrostatic potential bounded . for case",
    "a , each surface requires @xmath40 charge to achieve this .",
    "this net @xmath41 is compensated by the extra ( alo@xmath1)@xmath3 layer in the total structure , thus preserving global charge neutrality . for case",
    "b , the top surface requires @xmath40 charge , the bottom surface @xmath42 charge , and since the number of ( alo@xmath1)@xmath3 layers and ( lao)@xmath2 layers are equal , here again global charge neutrality is conserved . note that in case b , one could say that the @xmath43 was transferred from the bottom to the top surface , while in case a , @xmath43 may be considered to arise locally . in either case , the reconstruction of the top ( alo@xmath1)@xmath3 surface is identical , although to formally conserve total charge , knowledge of the bottom interface is needed .",
    "practically , these two surfaces are completely decoupled ( the thickness of our substrates are 0.5 mm , and certainly changing the termination layer on one surface does not affect the other across this macroscopic distance ) , so we address only the top surface in fig .",
    "[ cap - fig3 ] , as is conventional in such discussions of polar surfaces",
    ". therefore our conclusions are independent of the assignment of charge transfer .",
    "only when polar surfaces are microscopically close @xcite do they couple .",
    "a critical test of this model of coupled surface and interface reconstructions would be whether the carriers induced by the electronic reconstruction are holes , not electrons as in all previous examples @xcite .",
    "they should further be tunable with the laalo@xmath0 cap layer thickness . to determine the sign of the transport carriers ,",
    "the seebeck coefficient @xmath44 of the lao(@xmath10)/lvo(3 ) structures was measured , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap - fig5 ] .",
    "intrinsic voltage fluctuations at high impedance limited the measurements to higher temperatures and thin laalo@xmath0 cap samples .",
    "the positive sign of @xmath44 confirms hole - doping , and it systematically increased as a function of increasing laalo@xmath0 capping layer thickness , indicating a decreasing hole density and mirroring the evolution of the sheet resistance shown in fig .",
    "[ cap - fig2 ] .",
    "these results agree well with thermopower measurements of bulk la@xmath45sr@xmath46vo@xmath0 and la@xmath45ca@xmath46vo@xmath0 , where @xmath44 was positive for @xmath47 and decreased as the dopant concentration @xmath48 increased @xcite . given the compressive strain arising from the laalo@xmath0 substrate , the reduced electronic bandwidth , and interface scattering , a comparison between these lavo@xmath0 quantum wells and bulk values is an approximate one .",
    "nevertheless , this comparison indicates that the maximum equivalent hole density achieved in the single uc laalo@xmath0 cap sample is just below the bulk metal - insulator transition , occurring at @xmath49 in la@xmath45sr@xmath46vo@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical proposal suggests that doped holes at lavo@xmath0 interfaces are susceptible to charge ordering due to the artificial confined geometry @xcite , which may be relevant here .      in the regime of a thin laalo@xmath0 cap layer",
    ", a v@xmath7 component giving rise to these holes should be observable .",
    "this has indeed been seen recently by x - ray photoemission spectroscopy on lao(3)/lvo(@xmath11 ) structures ( grown on srtio@xmath0 substrates ) @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the spatial distribution was highly asymmetric , with the v@xmath7 predominantly in the topmost lavo@xmath0 layer .",
    "this non - uniformity naturally arises in fig .",
    "[ cap - fig3](b ) , since @xmath27 would thus be minimized .",
    "the detailed charge distribution is a balance between @xmath27 and the electronic compressibility .",
    "this issue was further studied by measuring the transport properties of lao(3)/lvo(@xmath11 ) quantum well structures . as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap - fig6 ] , the sheet resistance was strongly dependent on the lavo@xmath0 layer thickness @xmath11 .",
    "the data did not scale with @xmath50 , as would be expected for a uniform 3d resistivity . for @xmath51 ,",
    "there was little change in the sheet resistance , but for @xmath52 it increased more rapidly than @xmath50 , indicating the length scale for strong perturbation of the charge distribution by confinement effects . thus the thickness dependent resistance indicates that the conducting holes were distributed primarily at the top of the lavo@xmath0 layer , as would be expected for doping arising from the polar laalo@xmath0 surface .",
    "we have found a strong electrostatic coupling between the alo@xmath1-terminated laalo@xmath0 ( 001 ) surface and an embedded lavo@xmath0 quantum well . when they are separated by less than 4 - 6 nm , transport measurements indicate systematically increasing hole - doping with decreasing separation .",
    "we propose that these results reflect a competition between atomic and electronic reconstructions , driven by the need to resolve the divergent surface energy arising from the polar surface termination .",
    "an important aspect of this study is that the electronic reconstruction involves holes , not electrons .",
    "therefore the role of polar discontinuities can be more clearly distinguished from that of electron - donor oxygen vacancies , in contrast to previous examples .",
    "they further demonstrate that oxide heterostructures can be designed to introduce carriers without local chemical substitution , in analogy to modulation doping in compound semiconductor heterostructures .",

    "it is worth contrasting the laalo@xmath0 thickness dependence for the interface hole - doping we find here , with prior results for electron - doping at the ( 001)-oriented laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface @xcite ( and ( 001)-oriented lavo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface @xcite ) . for the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 structures ,",
    "there are two polar discontinuities , the laalo@xmath0 surface and the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface . without any reconstruction ,",
    "the finite shift @xmath53 remains , as shown in fig .",

    "[ cap - fig7](c ) . however , one reconstruction just by the laalo@xmath0 surface or by the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface alone is insufficient and the electrostatic potential diverges .",
