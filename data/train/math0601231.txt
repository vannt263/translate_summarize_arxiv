    "the moore diagram of an automaton is a directed graph with labeled edges .",

    "they showed that the group @xmath25 can be embedded into the group of finite automaton transformations over the alphabet of cardinality @xmath26 . since @xmath27 contains a free group , this yields two finite initial automata over a @xmath28-letter alphabet generating the free group .",
    "an example of a free group generated by finite automaton transformations over a @xmath29-letter alphabet was given by olijnyk and sushchanskij @xcite .",
    "a harder problem is to present the free group as the group defined by a single finite non - initial automaton .",
    "recently it was solved by glasner and mozes @xcite .",

    "the automata @xmath30 and @xmath31 are dual in that either of them can be obtained from the other by interchanging the alphabet with the set of internal states and the state transition function with the output function .    in this paper , we consider the problem of finding a finite automaton that defines a free group such that the rank of the group ( i.e. , the number of free generators ) is equal to the number of states of the automaton . a candidate for a solution has been available for some time .",
    "namely , brunner and sidki conjectured ( see @xcite ) that the first of two aleshin s automata shown in figure [ fig1 ] is the required one . here",
    "we prove that this is indeed the case .",
    "[ main1 ] three automorphisms of the rooted binary tree defined by the first aleshin automaton generate a free transformation group on three generators .",
    "the proof of the theorem is based on the dual automaton approach ( already used in @xcite ) .",
