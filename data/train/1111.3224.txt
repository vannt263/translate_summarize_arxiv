    "the conduction and valence bands touch each other in six points of the brillouin zone and are defined by two independent sets of cones commonly called @xmath0 and @xmath1 . near these points",
    "the electronic dispersion is linear which corresponds to the dispersion of massless relativistic particles , described by the dirac - weyl equation@xcite .    during the last decades",
    "there has been a lot of theoretical and experimental attempts to use the spin of the electron as a carrier of information@xcite .",
    "graphene in addition to the spin of the electron has two more degrees of freedom , sublattice pseudospin and valley isospin or valley index . in order to scatter an electron from the @xmath0 valley to the @xmath1 valley a large transfer of momentum",
    "is needed .",
    "typical disorder and coulomb - type of scattering is unable to provide this momentum and in such a case the valley isospin is a conserved quantum number in electronic transport .",
    "this allows us to use valley isospin as a carrier of information .",
    "it was shown that graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges@xcite can be used as a valley filter . another promising possibility to control the valley index of electrons is by using line defects@xcite .",
    "these can be formed in graphene when grown on a nickel substrate or by using so called mass barriers that can be created by proper arrangement of dopants in the graphene sheet@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to apply the above mentioned ideas to electron transport in the presence of circular mass barriers .",
    "we solve the dirac electron scattering problem on a sharp circular mass barrier and calculated the cross - section , the inverse momentum relaxation time and the probability for the electron to be reflected in the perpendicular direction . in spite of the circular symmetry of the scatterers we obtain a non zero perpendicular component of resistivity that allows us to separate electrons with different chirality , or belonging to @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys .",
    "the scattering of dirac electrons by a penetrable circular mass barrier is influenced by the presence of quasi - bound states that results in resonant behavior .",

    "vi we repeat this calculation for a penetrable circle and compared the results with the results for standard electrons that are presented in appendix a. our conclusions are presented in section vii .",
    "we consider a dirac electron interacting with circular barrier structures shown in fig .",

    "due to its diagonal form it is possible to separate the scattering problems in each @xmath0 or @xmath1 valley . we choose the following @xmath5 hamiltonians :    [ valham ] @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for the pauli matrices , and @xmath9 characterizes the mass barrier for @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons , respectively .",

    "[ fig1 ] by the solid red line , and the electron energy  in @xmath12 units . from now on all equations are for @xmath0 valley electrons , except if otherwise specified .",
    "according to standard scattering theory we present the wave function as @xmath13 consisting on the incident wave in the @xmath14-direction and the scattered part .",
    "the scattered part is characterized by the two component scattering amplitude @xmath15 as the incoming wave function part is normalized to unit flow density the differential cross - section is equal to the radial flow of electrons corresponding to the scattered wave function part , namely , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the unit vector in the considered direction .",
    "besides the above differential cross - section we shall consider the total cross - section @xmath18 and two more averages : the inverse electron momentum relaxation time ( the quantity proportional to the dissipative component of resistivity ) @xmath19 and the quantity @xmath20 that corresponds to the perpendicular component of resistivity ( or the analog of the hall component in the case with magnetic field ) .    due to the azimuthal symmetry of our problems it is convenient to use polar coordinates .",
    "thus , assuming the total wave function as @xmath21 we shall solve the set of equations    [ eqkc0 ] @xmath22    for the wave function components .",

    "a second major difference is that the wave function components @xmath46 and @xmath47 are discontinuous at the position of the @xmath38-function ( but the probability density is continuous ) while for schrdinger electrons the wave function is continuous but the derivative of the wave function is discontinuous in that position .",

    "this can be also seen from eq .",
    "( [ pparc ] ) which formally is similar to a lorentzian curve .",
    "the top of the peak is achieved when the second term in the denominator ( the analog of detuning ) in eq .",
    "( [ pparc ] ) is zero . in the case of small penetrability of the scatterer",
    "this can be realized if the large parameter @xmath134 is compensated by a small @xmath135 value .",
    "but then the contribution becomes equal to @xmath132 what indicates that the maximum of all peaks reach the above envelope function shown by green dotted curve in fig .",

    "one more property of the partial contribution follows from the fact that it is rather close to the same contribution in the case of scattering by impenetrable scatterer shown by the blue dashed curve ( eq .",
