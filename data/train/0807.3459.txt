    "the physics of collisionless shock waves is of paramount importance in modern astrophysics , as it governs a variety of phenomena , most notably the emission of high energy radiation .",
    "in particular , the afterglow radiation of gamma - ray bursts is generally attributed to the synchrotron emission of electrons that have been accelerated around the relativistic external shock wave , with shock lorentz factor @xmath1 ( paczyski & rhoads 1993 , katz 1994 , mszros & rees 1997 , sari & piran 1997 , vietri 1997 , waxman 1997 ; see piran 2005 for a review ) . in this framework",
    ", it can be shown that the magnetic field , downstream of the shock wave , must have been amplified by orders of magnitude beyond the shock compression of a typical interstellar magnetic field ( see for instance waxman 1997 ; see also piran 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "recent work by li & waxman ( 2006 ) further shows that even the upstream magnetic field must have been amplified by at least one or two orders of magnitude in order to explain observed @xmath2ray afterglows .",
    "these results should be put in perspective with recent studies on the process of fermi acceleration in the test particle limit around relativistic shock waves . in particular , niemiec & ostrowski ( 2006 )",
    "have shown that fermi acceleration becomes inoperative in a turbulent magnetic field with power spectra of the kolmogorov or scale invariant type . through analytical calculations , lemoine , pelletier & revenu ( 2006 ) have shown that relativistic fermi acceleration is inefficient if the magnetic field power is distributed on scales larger than the typical larmor radius of the accelerated population , in agreement with the above numerical result .",
    "therefore the interpretation of the gamma - ray burst afterglow emission from the relativistic external shock wave requires the magnetic field to have been amplified on short spatial scales .",
    "it has been suggested that the relativistic two stream weibel instability could amplify the downstream magnetic field to the level required by afterglow modeling of gamma - ray bursts ( gruzinov & waxman 1999 ; medvedev & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "subsequent studies have however argued that this instability should saturate early on ( wiersma & achterberg 2004 ; lyubarsky & eichler 2006 ) .",
    "the question of the long term evolution of the downstream magnetic field ( on timescales @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the plasma frequency ) also remains open .",
    "ongoing particle - in - cell simulations should eventually shed light on this issue ( silva _ et al . _",
    "2003 ; frederiksen _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ; medvedev _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; kato 2007 ; chang , spitkovsky & arons 2008 ; keshet _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 ; spitkovsky 2008 ) .",
    "regarding the amplification of the upstream magnetic field , the present situation is reminiscent of results obtained for non - relativistic supernovae remnant shock waves , where the interstellar magnetic field has apparently been amplified by one or two orders of magnitude ( see vlk , berezhko & ksenofontov 2005 , parizot _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) . in this case , the leading candidate for the instability is the streaming instability , seeded by the cosmic ray precursor in the upstream plasma ( see bell 2004 , 2005 ; pelletier , lemoine & marcowith 2006 , marcowith , lemoine & pelletier 2006 ; reville _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ; niemiec et al . 2008 ; amato & blasi 2008 ; zirakashvili , ptuskin & vlk 2008 ; reville et al .",
    "the generalization of this instability to the relativistic regime has been studied on phenomenological grounds by milosavljevi & nakar ( 2006 ) who have concluded that it should be able to account for the degree of amplification inferred in gamma - ray bursts .",
    "more recently , reville , kirk & duffy ( 2006 ) have derived in detail the dispersion relation for a parallel shock wave and the saturation due to thermal effects .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose to explore in detail the generalization of this type of instability to the ultra - relativistic regime @xmath5 .",
    "one crucial difference with the previous works on the streaming instability is that we consider the most natural case of superluminal shock waves ( with a magnetic field perpendicular to the shock normal in the shock front frame ) .",
    "this case is more generic than the parallel configuration studied previously because the transverse component of the magnetic field is boosted by the shock lorentz factor when going to the shock frame .",
    "another important difference is that we bring to light a new type of instability , of a compressive nature .",
    "finally , in contrast with most particle - in - cell simulations performed to date , our study focusses on magnetized shock waves , for which there exists a coherent upstream magnetic field ( whose dynamical influence on the shock jump conditions can be neglected however ) .",
    "nevertheless there exist pioneering pic simulations in the moderately relativistic regime , which include both a mean field and a significant mass ratio between electrons and ions , see hededal & nishikawa ( 2005 ) , dieckmann , shukla , & drury ( 2008 ) .",
    "we adopt a simplified description in which the cosmic - ray distribution is modeled as a step function out to some distance @xmath6 and we neglect the cosmic - ray response to the disturbance .",
    "this latter assumption is justified by the fact that the instability is maximal on the shortest spatial scales , orders of magnitude below the typical larmor radius of accelerated particles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : general ] , we introduce the main scales of the problem , most notably the diffusion scale of the cosmic rays ; we then calculate the level of amplification that is necessary to make fermi acceleration operative . section  [ sec : instab ] is devoted to the investigation of the instabilities under the condition that some cosmic - rays have undergone a first fermi cycle .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] summarizes out results and provides some outlook .",
    "details of the calculations are provided in appendix  [ sec : appperp ] .",
    "we carry out most of the discussion in the shock front rest frame , hence unless otherwise noted , all quantities are evaluated in this frame .",
    "we use the subscripts @xmath7 or @xmath8 to tag quantities measured in the upstream or in the downstream rest frame respectively .      in the upstream rest frame",
    ", cosmic rays can never stream too far ahead of a relativistic shock wave since this latter propagates towards upstream with velocity @xmath9 [ the shock lorentz factor @xmath10 .",
    "cosmic rays scatter on magnetic turbulence upstream before they are caught back by the shock wave when their pitch angle @xmath11 ( gallant & achterberg 1999 , achterberg _ et al .",
    "consequently , they can travel a distance @xmath12 , which may take the following values depending on the ratio of the larmor radius @xmath13 to the coherence length of the upstream magnetic field @xmath14 ( milosavljevi & nakar 2006 ) :    * for small scale turbulence @xmath15 * for large scale turbulence @xmath16    both regimes , short or large scale turbulence can be expected at some point , insofar as the excitation of the upstream magnetic field on short spatial scales is due to the streaming of the non - thermal particle population in the shock precursor . indeed , cosmic rays of the first generation are to interact with a turbulent magnetic field ordered on large scales .",
    "however , provided the instability that they trigger grows fast enough , cosmic rays of the next generation will propagate in short scale turbulence .",
    "in reality , the situation is likely to be more complex as the process of particle propagation upstream and magnetic field generation are closely intertwined .",
    "the fact that the non - thermal population contains particles of different energies , which can stream at different distances from the shock front , should also play a significant role . in this respect ,",
    "keshet _ et al . _",
    "( 2008 ) have observed that the upstream magnetic field is affected to greater distances as time goes on .",
    "this strongly suggests that higher energy cosmic rays are produced as time goes on , and that , by travelling farther in the upstream medium , they excite the turbulence at larger distances from the shock front .    in the discussion that follows ,",
    "we estimate the growth of unstable modes in both the limits of small or large scale turbulence in order to remain as general as possible .",
    "certainly the limit of large scale turbulence is more restrictive with respect to the growth of the instability , since the distance travelled upstream is significantly reduced with respect to that in small scale turbulence .",
    "whichever limit prevails depends on the ratio of the short scale turbulent to the large scale ( coherent ) magnetic field strength , as discussed in section  [ sec : fermi ] .",
    "we also discuss the effect of higher energy cosmic rays on the growth rate .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the distance that controls the growth of the instability is that between the shock front and the position of the particle , which is smaller than @xmath17 by a factor @xmath18 . in the following",
    ", we will need the expression for @xmath19 ( also noted @xmath6 ) , i.e. the length scale of the cosmic - ray distribution as measured in the shock front rest frame .",
    "it can be calculated by transforming the upstream residence time @xmath20 in the shock front frame @xmath21 , and then by rewriting in the expression obtained the upstream larmor radius and coherence length in terms of their shock frame equivalent . in the perpendicular ( or superluminal and ultra - relativistic ) configuration of interest , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "this boost of the coherence length is valid for wavenumber modes that are parallel to the shock normal ; perpendicular wavenumber modes remain unchanged . in the following ,",
    "we thus use the following expressions for @xmath6 :    * for small scale turbulence @xmath24 * for large scale turbulence @xmath25    below , we find a process of generation of intense magnetic disturbances at short spatial scales .",
    "the expected instabilities in all relevant cases generate disturbances with a coherence length @xmath14 between the minimal length @xmath26 required for the validity of mhd description and the diffusion length @xmath17 of the cosmic rays , but with a preference for short scale , i.e. @xmath27 . the minimal mhd length is : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes throughout this paper the alfvn velocity ( measured upstream ) in units of @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the larmor radius of thermal protons in the upstream comoving frame .",
    "the above mhd scale is measured in the upstream plasma rest frame .      as discussed in lemoine , pelletier & revenu ( 2006 )",
    ", a particle can execute a large number of fermi cycles through the shock only if the turbulence coherence scale is much smaller than the larmor radius ( assuming no coherent magnetic field ) , in detail @xmath32 upstream , or @xmath33 as measured downstream .",
    "the fermi process becomes inoperative in the limit of large coherence length ( when compared to the typical larmor radius ) since the cycle time becomes smaller than a coherence time hence the field is effectively regular and superluminal on a typical fermi cycle .",
    "conversely , the fermi process will be operative provided either of the above inequalities is fulfilled , since the memory of the initial conditions at shock crossing is then erased by pitch angle diffusion in the short scale turbulence .    in the generic case of a ultra - relativistic superluminal shock ,",
    "the above two conditions are actually related by the shock jump conditions , since the larmor radius increases by @xmath34 when going from downstream to upstream , while the coherence length increases by @xmath35 .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 corresponds to the lorentz factor of the downstream fluid as measured upstream , and in the case of a ultra - relativistic strong shock , @xmath37 ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) .    in the following ,",
    "we describe the upstream and downstream fluids as comprising a large scale component @xmath38 and a short scale turbulent generated by some unspecified instability . in this case , fermi acceleration will be efficient provided the short scale field has a sufficient amplitude as compared to @xmath39 .",
    "we discuss this condition in the following .      in this particular section ,",
    "all quantities are evaluated in the upstream rest frame and we avoid using the notation @xmath7 out of clarity . we derive here the requirements on the amplitude of the short scale component of the magnetic field that would allow successful fermi acceleration . without loss of generality , we assume that the coherent component @xmath38 lies in the plane @xmath40 , the @xmath41 direction corresponding to the shock normal ( oriented toward upstream infinity ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 the irregular component ( whose amplitude is expressed in units of @xmath39 ) . the layout is pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : shock_conf ] .",
    "the total field is thus written as @xmath43 , and the particle trajectory is governed by the following equation : @xmath44 with @xmath45 denoting the larmor frequency expressed relatively to @xmath39 .",
    "we neglect the influence of any short scale time varying electric field @xmath46 in the above equation of motion since @xmath47 .    in order to quantify the return timescale and the condition for successful fermi acceleration as a function of the amplitude of the random component of the magnetic field , it is useful to express this equation in terms of the angles @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which are defined as : @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "these equations of motion read : @xmath53\\ , \\label{eq : t}\\\\ \\dot\\phi&\\,=\\ , & \\omega_{\\rm    l,0}\\,\\left[-e_x - b_x +    \\left(e_y+b_y\\right)\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta } +    b_z\\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta}\\right]\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : p1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] rescaling the larmor frequency with respect to @xmath54 , i.e. defining @xmath55 , and noting that @xmath56 when the particle propagates upstream , the equations of motion for @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be rewritten as follows : @xmath57 the factors @xmath58 and @xmath59 describe respectively the amplitude and the phase of the small scale magnetic field in the shock front plane , i.e. @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( assuming isotropic turbulence ) . the amplitude @xmath62 is measured with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "one can extract from the above system the unperturbed trajectory , i.e. assuming @xmath64 : @xmath65 where values indexed with @xmath66 are calculated at some initial time . since entry into upstream corresponds to @xmath67",
    "hence @xmath68 , and exit from upstream corresponds to @xmath69 , the above equation suggests that @xmath49 is driven to an angle close to @xmath70 .",
    "the sign is given by the sign of @xmath71 : for @xmath72 , it is @xmath73 .",
    "this region lies opposite to that which allows return to the shock when the particle travels downstream ( see lemoine , pelletier & revenu 2006 ) , hence fermi cycles can not be completed .",
    "it is important to note that this unperturbed trajectory is executed on a timescale @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 ) .",
    "the noise term comes from the random phase @xmath59 ( assuming isotropic turbulence in the shock front plane , an assumption that can be relaxed ) .",
    "therefore the trajectory deviates from the unperturbed trajectory to linear order by @xmath76 , whose variance increases linearly with time : @xmath77 note that the above equation does not contain all the terms driving the variance of @xmath49 and @xmath48 : it neglects term of the form @xmath78 and similarly in @xmath79 .",
    "however , these terms are smaller by @xmath80 as compared to those above , hence they can be neglected in a first approximation ( we will find @xmath81 further below ) .    in the absence of the regular driving term in the equations of motion ( i.e. when @xmath82 ) , return occurs over a timescale @xmath83 .",
    "noise dominates over the unperturbed trajectory if @xmath84 , where @xmath48 indicates the unperturbed trajectory .",
    "this inequality must be satisfied within a ( return ) timescale @xmath85 otherwise the particle will have exited from upstream ( along the weakly perturbed unperturbed trajectory ) before the noise could overcome the unperturbed driving force .",
    "this implies : @xmath86 if one defines the larmor radius @xmath87 measured with respect to the total magnetic field , @xmath88^{-1}$ ] , hence @xmath89 when @xmath81 , the former inequality amounts to : @xmath90 if this inequality is satisfied , then one can check that @xmath91 on a return timescale @xmath92 , which implies that the return directions are isotropized in the shock front plane .",
    "fermi acceleration should then be efficient ( provided the return probability to the shock as calculated downstream is also isotropic in @xmath49 , see below ) .",
    "an interesting implication of the above is to restrict fermi acceleration to a rather limited range of larmor radii : @xmath93 very high values of the amplification factor are thus required to produce powerlaw spectra over a large dynamic range .",
    "all quantities in this subsection are evaluated in the downstream rest frame . in this frame , the coherent magnetic field is nearly fully aligned with the @xmath94axis , and we assume indeed that @xmath95 . it is useful to study the evolution of the velocity components perpendicular ( @xmath96 ) and parallel ( @xmath97 ) to the direction of @xmath38 : @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "the equations of motion for the velocity @xmath100 can then be written : @xmath101 one can check that @xmath102 as it should since @xmath103 is conserved .",
    "the unperturbed trajectory for the couple of variables ( @xmath97 , @xmath96 ) is trivial , i.e. @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "return may occur or not , depending on these initial velocity components ; if it occurs , it does so on a timescale @xmath106 ( lemoine , pelletier & revenu 2006 ) .",
    "since @xmath107 is not compressed through shock crossing , @xmath108 for isotropic upstream turbulence , hence this component can be neglected . integrating the above equations to calculate the squared perpendicular displacement ,",
    "one finds : @xmath109 in the above equation , @xmath110 represents the unperturbed trajectory : @xmath111 .",
    "the function @xmath112 contains powers of @xmath113 up to @xmath114 , as well as sine and cosine functions of @xmath115 ; its dimension is that of @xmath116 .",
    "noise will then dominate over the unperturbed trajectory @xmath117 over a unperturbed return timescale if : @xmath118 or , equivalently : @xmath119 as before , @xmath87 denotes the larmor radius measured with respect to the total magnetic field .",
    "this condition on @xmath58 is very similar to that obtained upstream , since @xmath120 and @xmath121 , while @xmath122 .",
    "according to the above analysis , and following lemoine , pelletier & revenu ( 2006 ) , phase mixing should be sufficiently large to erase all dependence on the phase of the velocity vectors , hence fermi acceleration should be fully operative , if either one of the above conditions on @xmath58 is satisfied .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the above results in light of recent monte carlo numerical simulations of relativistic fermi acceleration in the presence of short scale turbulence ( niemiec , ostrowski & pohl 2006 ) .",
    "these authors have investigated the efficiency of the fermi process for various turbulence configurations , including a coherent magnetic field , a long wave turbulence and a short scale component .",
    "they confirm that fermi acceleration is not operative if @xmath123 , but find that a spectrum can develop over about two orders of magnitude when @xmath124 ( see their fig .  1 ) .",
    "the high energy break can be directly interpreted as the energy at which the above inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineq - d ] ) is no longer fulfilled . beyond that point , the spectrum steepends and the fermi process becomes inoperative .",
    "interestingly , these authors also show that if the pitch angle scattering amplitude in the short scale turbulence is independent of energy , the break disappears and the spectrum continues without bound .",
    "this is also expected , insofar as the break that is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineq - d ] ) stems from the fact that the scattering time in the short scale turbulence scales as the square of the larmor time whereas the unperturbed trajectory in the background field depends linearly on the larmor time . assuming a constant pitch angle scattering amplitude in the notations of niemiec",
    ", pohl & ostrowski ( 2006 ) implies that the two scattering timescales evolve in the same way , hence if short scale turbulence suffices to isotropize directions at a given energy , it will do so at all energies .    in order to produce powerlaw spectra over a large dynamic range ,",
    "it is thus necessary to reach an amplification factor @xmath125 as large as possible , since this ratio determines the dynamic range of particle energies .",
    "interestingly , the afterglow modeling of gamma - ray bursts suggest that indeed , the usptream and downstream magnetic fields have been amplified by a large factor . in the range of energies in which fermi acceleration is operative",
    ", it is likely that the spectral index would be equal to the so - called canonical value @xmath126 , although the generality of this prediction for different shapes of the @xmath127d turbulence spectrum remains to be studied .",
    "the results of niemiec , ostrowski & pohl ( 2006 ) can not be used to infer this spectral index , since they have restricted their analysis to values of @xmath128 , and the spectral indices they report have been measured beyond the break energy .",
    "techniques developed in lemoine & pelletier ( 2003 ) , lemoine & revenu ( 2006 ) are particularly suited to study this problem and calculations are underway .",
    "the magnetic field in the shock front @xmath129 is related to the magnetic field in the upstream frame @xmath130 and the associated electric field @xmath131 through the lorentz transform : @xmath132 to zeroth order , the electric field in the upstream plasma frame vanishes , hence the magnetic field in the shock front frame is mostly perpendicular unless @xmath133 is aligned along the shock normal to within an angle @xmath134 ( subluminal shock ) .",
    "it then suffices to consider the fully perpendicular situation with @xmath135 .",
    "the cosmic rays stream ahead of the shock wave , carrying a net charge density @xmath136 which will induce a counteracting charge density @xmath137 in the background plasma .",
    "note that the cosmic rays do not induce an electrical current at zeroth order in the shock front frame , only a net charge density .",
    "since we consider the generation of short scale turbulence , we neglect the cosmic ray response to this short scale turbulence other than its effect on the cosmic ray distribution scale @xmath6 . for simplicity ,",
    "we approximate the cosmic - ray charge profile with a top - hat distribution .    as usual , we search for a stationary regime which serves as a basis for perturbating the equations in the time - dependent regime .",
    "the details of the calculations are provided in appendix  [ sec : appperp ] for both stationary and time dependent quantities .",
    "in particular , the stationary regime exhibits the following set - up : @xmath138 recalling that the shock normal is directed along @xmath41 , @xmath139 characterizes the velocity of the upstream inflowing through the front .",
    "the velocity component @xmath140 along the front is small compared to @xmath141 , but its shear @xmath142 can not be neglected ( see appendix  [ sec : appperp ] ) .      the complete system that governs the linear evolution is of seventh order ( see appendix  [ sec : appperp ] ) and",
    "thus rather involved . nevertheless , it remains possible to derive the main results since the lorentz transform from the upstream comoving frame to the shock front frame dominates the mhd propagation effects when the wave scale is  not too small \" , as will be made more precise in a next subsection .",
    "in other words , the instability growth rates can be derived to lowest order by assuming vanishing alfvn and sound velocities .",
    "we have verified that the analysis of the system including @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( but neglecting terms in @xmath140 ) does not modify the growth rates obtained further below .",
    "one should point out that electromagnetic waves with dispersion relation @xmath145 are lorentz transformed into waves with dispersion relation : @xmath146 in particular , for alfvn waves , the next term on the r.h.s .",
    "is @xmath147 .",
    "note that the alfvn velocity is always expressed in the upstream plasma rest frame , i.e. @xmath148 .",
    "therefore it suffices in what follows to consider the limit @xmath149 .",
    "the limit @xmath150 can also be considered but it appears more restrictive , because it limits the analysis to the evolution of upstream magnetosonic modes .",
    "we will thus consider both cases @xmath151 and @xmath152 finite .",
    "of course , one can use fourier analysis without mode coupling as long as the spatial dependence of the system coefficients can be neglected , in agreement with our previous approximations , and in particular , that the cosmic ray charge density is modeled as a step function . in the shock front rest frame , the physical picture of the instability is then as follows .",
    "impingent electromagnetic waves propagate in vacuum beyond the length scale @xmath6 which characterizes the spatial distribution of cosmic rays upstream of the shock front . for @xmath153 ,",
    "the presence of the cosmic - ray charge density induces a short scale instability .",
    "hence we consider electromagnetic waves and seek a solution in fourier space with @xmath154 set by its vacuum dispersion relation , but with a complex @xmath155 characterizing the amplification in the charge layer @xmath156 .    in this perpendicular configuration ,",
    "the return current ( in the upstream frame ) is not responsible for a supplementary tension effect , but for a supplementary compression effect .",
    "a @xmath157 perturbation leads to a supplementary vertical ( i.e. along @xmath158 ) compression that can push like the kinetic compression . if we consider a spatial modulation along the mean field ( @xmath159 ) , a vertical perturbation @xmath160 generates a supplementary compression in the direction of the mean field that can push in phase with the kinetic compression as well .    for large @xmath161",
    "even with @xmath162 , the system reduces to fourth order and can be expressed as the coupling between the propagation of the vertical perturbed motion @xmath163 and the propagation of kinetic compression @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the relativistic proper enthalpy density of the cold upstream plasma .",
    "the system of the two coupled equations can be expressed using the system of eqs .",

    "in particular in this limit , one notes that @xmath168 .",
    "then one obtains a single equation for @xmath163 ( see appendix  [ sec : perteq ] ) where derivatives @xmath169 cancel out and where the derivative of @xmath140 is inserted , its second derivative being neglected ( we also assume @xmath170 in the coefficients ) : @xmath171 the differential operator @xmath172 is defined by @xmath173 . for a detailed understanding of the instabilities one has to notice that the charge is not completely screened by the plasma as a supplementary electric field is generated along the flow ( i.e. oriented towards @xmath174 ) : @xmath175 , along with a sheared vertical motion @xmath140 such that @xmath176 ( see appendix  [ sec : appperp ] ) .",

    "the reduced form of the equation ( see appendix  [ sec : perteq ] ) clearly shows the ordering ( by setting @xmath180 , @xmath181 ) : @xmath182 the inhomogeneity is contained in @xmath183 that vanishes at large distance from the shock . at infinity @xmath184 , which implies that",

    "one obtains : @xmath213 which can be rewritten in terms of the fraction @xmath214 of ( downstream ) shock internal energy converted into ( downstream ) cosmic ray energy : @xmath215 to this effect , we assume that the accelerated population can be described as a power - law of index @xmath216 and minimum momentum @xmath217 , so that : @xmath218 this equation assumes @xmath219 ; if @xmath220 , then @xmath221 should be replaced by @xmath222 .",
    "since @xmath223 ( as @xmath224 for a strong ultra - relativistic shock ) , one obtains : @xmath225 here @xmath226 denotes the minimum larmor radius of the accelerated population , as measured upstream .",
    "the typical energy of the first generation of cosmic rays is @xmath227 , so that @xmath228 .",
    "therefore @xmath229 thus @xmath207 defines an mhd scale .    in order for the instability to be efficient , one must also require @xmath230 , which is a non - trivial requirement in view of the restricted value of @xmath6 .",
    "one finds : @xmath231 with @xmath232 for large scale turbulence , and @xmath233 for short scale turbulence . in the latter case , one may assume @xmath234 , as suggested by the fact that the growth rate increases with @xmath235 , so that @xmath236 . then , in both cases , the total growth is presumably much larger than unity if @xmath214 is not too small and @xmath155 , @xmath152 sufficiently large as compared to @xmath207 .",
    "hence even the first generation of cosmic rays is able to destabilize the upstream magnetic field on the shortest scales .",
    "the effect of the high energy part of the accelerated population will be addressed shortly .",
    "as mentioned , the study of the more extended system including the contribution of the terms involving the alfvnic and sonic contributions ( but neglecting terms of order @xmath140 in the system ) confirms the results above for the growth rates , provided @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "one can estimate the amplitude of the various components in terms of @xmath157 .",
    "it has already been mentioned that @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath241 thus we find that @xmath160 may achieve a large amplitude , because @xmath242 in the frame of linear theory , the saturation level of these magneto - sonic instabilities is simply estimated by the fact that the compression has a limited amplitude @xmath243 .",
    "defining the power spectrum of @xmath157 and @xmath160 per log interval of wavenumber @xmath244 in terms of the fourier component @xmath245 and similarly for @xmath246 in terms of @xmath247 , one derives from eq .",
    "( [ eq : redsys ] ) : @xmath248 and @xmath249 note that the power spectrum is normalized to the ratio of amplitude of the turbulent ( small scale ) component to the coherent @xmath39 .",
    "consider the first branch of the instability , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : g2 ] ) which applies in the limit @xmath250 , @xmath251 .",
    "there one can show that @xmath252 saturates at a value of order @xmath253 , but @xmath254 saturates at a value of order unity when @xmath255 .",
    "for the second branch , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g5 ] ) and which applies in the limit @xmath256 , one finds that @xmath257 saturates at a value of order @xmath258 , but again @xmath259 saturates at a value unity .",
    "this moderate saturation level can be directly traced back to the saturation of these compressive modes at the linear level @xmath260 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fermi ] , such a level @xmath261 should not allow a powerlaw spectrum to develop through fermi acceleration .    nevertheless , our present analytical description is by definition limited to the linear regime . it would certainly be interesting to pursue the calculations using numerical simulations as one could expect that the holes produced in the plasma would widen with the growing magnetic pressure inside and that the density excesses become spikes .",
    "thus one might reasonably expect the generation of many local small magneto - sonic shocks that are absorbed by the main ultra - relativistic shocks , with the reconversion of some amount of cosmic - ray energy into thermal energy in the precursor .",
    "the previous discussion has focused on the role played by the first generation of cosmic rays , since higher energy cosmic rays can only be present if acceleration to smaller energies has been completed .",
    "however it is easy to verify that , if highest energy cosmic rays are present in the shock precursor , they are bound to play a dominant role in the amplification of the magnetic field , most notably because the length scale of the cosmic ray distribution increases as @xmath262 .",
    "for instance , at a distance @xmath41 from the shock front where only cosmic rays of momentum larger than @xmath263 can be found , the critical wavenumber for the instability reads for @xmath264 ( @xmath265 spectral index of the accelerated population ) : @xmath266 where @xmath267 denotes the same wavenumber evaluated for the whole cosmic - ray distribution , and @xmath268 denotes the minimum momentum of the cosmic ray distribution at the shock front .",
    "consequently , if @xmath269 , with @xmath270 or @xmath271 for the two branches of the instability obtained above : @xmath272 with @xmath273 for large scale turbulence , @xmath274 for short scale turbulence . here",
    "as well , @xmath275 should be understood as the growth rate derived previously for the whole cosmic - ray distribution .",
    "this product grows with increasing @xmath276 provided @xmath277 , i.e. @xmath278 ( @xmath274 , @xmath270 ) , or @xmath279 ( @xmath274 , @xmath280 ) , or @xmath281 ( @xmath273 , @xmath270 ) or finally @xmath282 ( @xmath273 , @xmath280 ) .",
    "these inequalities are likely to be fulfilled .",
    "finally , the product @xmath283 scales as @xmath284 hence decreases if @xmath285 .",
    "this also means the typical scale of the instability increases with increasing @xmath276 .",
    "of course , the above implicitly ignores the spatial dependence of @xmath286 , but it suggests that amplification through the streaming of the highest energy part of the cosmic ray distribution will seed much more efficiently the magnetic field amplification .",
    "since the above compressive instabilities appear to saturate at a level too small ( @xmath287 ) to allow fermi acceleration over a broad range of energies , the possible existence of non - compressive instability becomes crucial .",
    "one can search for such modes by selecting the wave vectors accordingly , in which case the reduced system becomes : @xmath288 it is easy to verify that this system possesses no unstable solution but only damped solutions .",
    "hence incompressible unstable modes do not exist in this mhd description .",
    "in this study , we have examined the amplification of a pre - existing magnetic field upstream of an ultra - relativistic shock wave .",
    "we have assumed that the magnetic field is fully perpendicular to the shock normal in the shock front frame , as generally expected in the ultra - relativistic limit @xmath5 . in the shock frame",
    ", the cosmic rays do not induce any current at zeroth order , only a net charge density , which is partly screened by the inflowing plasma .",
    "this charge distribution then triggers an instability on very short spatial scales , with a growth rate increasing with the wavenumber .",
    "cosmic rays do not respond to this amplification as it takes on scales much shorter than the typical larmor radius .",
    "it is important to stress that these instabilities are of a different nature than the resonant or non - resonant instability studied by bell ( 2004 ) in the case of a non - relativistic parallel shock wave , most notably because they are essentially _",
    "compressive_. since density depletions are naturally limited , our linear analysis indicates that these instabilities saturate at a moderate level of amplification , @xmath289 .",
    "furthermore , there is no unstable incompressible mode within the present mhd approximation which could provide a higher level of amplification .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , within the framework of ideal mhd , instabilities at ultra - relativistic magnetized shock waves appear limited in their efficiency .",
    "such instabilities can not therefore account for the degree of amplification that has been inferred from the modeling of the afterglow radiation of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "we have also argued in section  [ sec : fermi ] that the ratio @xmath290 sets the dynamic range of energies over which powerlaw spectra can be produced through fermi acceleration .",
    "the present instabilities thus can not allow successful fermi acceleration .",
    "nevertheless , it would certainly be useful to pursue the present investigation with dedicated numerical simlations , which would allow one to go beyond the present linear approximation and study whether non - linear effects can push the small scale magnetic field to higher values .",
    "if the standard interpretation of gamma - ray burst afterglows as the synchrotron light of electrons accelerated at the forward shock ( but see uhm & beloborodov 2006 , genet , daigne & mochkovitch 2007 for recent alternatives involving the reverse shock ) holds , one is led to conclude that some other instability is able to amplify the upstream magnetic field on short spatial scales , or that some other form of acceleration mechanism is operating ( see for instance hoshino 2008 for an alternative involving radiative pressure effects ) .",
    "the present work indicates that such cosmic ray induced instabilities would involve non - mhd effects .",
    "the short spatial scales @xmath291 required are in conflict with the usual synchrotron resonance between cosmic rays and mhd waves ; this remark is actually one of the motivation of the present work in a full mhd framework .",
    "however , one can not rule out that other types of resonance could become relevant and yet involve incompressible modes , such as alfvn waves .",
    "one promising instability , currently under study , involves a cerenkov resonance ( @xmath292 ) between plasma waves and the cosmic ray beam , generating a modified two stream instability .",
    "the growth rates appear quite promising and the details will be given in a forthcoming article .",
    "in the shock front frame , the electric field , current and charge density read : @xmath293 the four velocity of the inflowing plasma is written @xmath294 ( hence @xmath295 is dimensionless ) . in this equation",
    ", @xmath296 represents the total lorentz factor of the upstream plasma ; it will be shown to coincide nearly with @xmath161 in the following .",
    "note that in the shock front , there is no current at zeroth order associated with the cosmic rays , only a net charge density @xmath297 which may be partially screened by an induced non - zero plasma charge density @xmath137 .",
    "faraday s law implies in this stationary regime : @xmath298 hence the gauss equation can be rewritten as : @xmath299    energy momentum conservation for the upstream fluid implies : @xmath300 where @xmath301 is the proper mass density of the upstream plasma .",

    "for instance the ratio : @xmath308 since @xmath309 ; @xmath310 represents the alfvn velocity ( as measured in the upstream rest frame ) . hence : @xmath311 consider now the ratio of the first term on the lhs of the second equation in ( [ eq : mom2 ] ) to the term of the rhs of the same equation : @xmath312 this ratio is much smaller than unity ( since @xmath313 ) . then : @xmath314 in the last equation , @xmath315 corresponds to the maximal distance to which cosmic rays can stream ahead of the shock front , as measured in the shock front frame .",
    "we also assume that @xmath141 , @xmath63 and @xmath316 vary on much longer scales than @xmath140 , and that @xmath317 .",
    "this hierarchy can be verified by taking the ratios of the equations in ( [ eq : mom1 ] ) .    since @xmath318",
    ", one can simplify the previous expression and obtain the following order of magnitude : @xmath319 to obtain this result , we have approximated the integral over @xmath136 as @xmath320 , @xmath6 representing the length scale of the distribution in the shock frame , and written @xmath321 ; @xmath322 denotes the cosmic ray energy density while @xmath263 ( @xmath323 ) represents their typical momentum ( larmor radius ) . finally , @xmath324 where @xmath214 is the fraction of shock internal energy carried away by the accelerated population . in a straightforward way ,",

    "this latter quantity is of the same order than other background quantities and can not be neglected .",
    "however , terms in @xmath140 will be neglected in the final equations of evolution of the various background quantities since @xmath328 . for similar reasons , derivatives of background quantities ( other than @xmath140 ) such as @xmath137 , @xmath63 and @xmath141 ( hence @xmath296 )",
    "can be neglected .",
