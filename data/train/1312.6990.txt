    "probabilistic cellular automata ( pca ) are discrete - time markov processes modelling the time evolution of a multicomponent system .",
    "their main feature is the synchronous update of the states of the components , which take values in a finite set and interact with their neighbours according to a given probabilistic interaction rule .",
    "pca are favourable models to study non - equilibrium phenomena . indeed ,",
    "on the one hand , their definition is simple , as the space of realizations is discrete and interactions are local . on the other hand , despite this simplicity , they show a variety of complex behaviours .    one of the interesting phenomena involving probabilistic cellular automata is the transition from ergodic to non - ergodic regime . after setting a free parameter above or below a certain critical threshold , at infinite time the process preserves part of the information on its initial condition ( non - ergodic behaviour ) .",
    "namely , the probability measure at infinite time depends on the initial state of the dynamics . on the contrary , if the process is ergodic , it admits a unique , attracting invariant measure .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that the non - ergodic regime of a pca is connected to the existence of a phase transition for the pca , considered as a statistical mechanics system .    over the last 50 years",
    ", pca have undergone intense analytical and numerical investigations ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , as far as we know , many questions involving the rate of convergence to equilibrium or the characterisation of the invariant measures still remain open , even for the simplest models ( see e.g. @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "in this paper we consider a class of pca that has a correspondence with percolation .",
    "these models are refereed to as _ percolation systems _ in @xcite and as _ percolation operators _ in @xcite . from now on we will refer to them as _ percolation pca_. this class includes the well studied _ stavksaya s process _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in which the neighbourhood of every corresponds to the site itself and its right nearest neighbour on the one dimensional lattice . on the contrary in percolation pca the neighbourhood of every site could be any finite ( translation invariant ) set .",
    "the reason why we decided to consider percolation pca is that their simplicity , combined with the presence of a phase transition , make them an interesting test case for attempts to characterise transient behaviour and stationary measures for spatially extended stochastic dynamics .",
    "namely percolation pca are a prominent model for studying _ absorbing state phase transitions _ ( @xcite ) ,",
    "i.e. there exists a phase characterised by almost sure convergence into an `` absorbing state '' ( a realisation where the process remains for ever whenever reached ) and a fluctuating phase , where the process remains active at all times .    in this paper",
    "we discuss two distinct aspects of the percolation pca . in section [",
    "sect : criticalprobabilities ] we study how the neighbourhood affects the critical probability .",
    "we provide a lower bound for critical probabilities @xmath10 and our result is stated in theorem [ theo : maintheorem1 ] . with our estimations we improve the previous lower bound @xcite showing that @xmath11 strictly if the neighbourhood @xmath12 . furthermore , we provide new bounds in case of neighbourhoods not considered before ( as far as we know ) . the comparison with numerical estimations , provided in the last section of this article , shows that our bounds are sharp . in order to derive the lower bound",
    "we studied the temporal evolution evolution of `` absorbed sets '' ( sets of adjacent sites all in state `` zero '' ) .",
    "if these sets on average are expanding , the realisation at infinite time is `` all zeros '' almost surely .",
    "this idea comes from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) .",
    "our estimations take into account a certain aspect of the dynamics , i.e. absorbed sets can dynamically merge one with the other .",
    "this leads to an improvement of the bound .    in section [",
    "sect : timeofconvergence ] we consider percolation pca on a finite one dimensional lattice with periodic boundaries and we study the convergence time of the process into the absorbing state .",
    "our second main result is stated in theorem [ theo : maintheorem2 ] .",
    "we show that at @xmath13 there exists a transition from a fast to a slow convergence regime .",
    "namely we prove that the expected convergence time of the model grows exponentially ( resp .",
    "logarithmically ) as the size of the system grows if @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) .",
    "this provides a partial answer to the _ unsolved problem 5.3.3 _ in @xcite and to an open problem mentioned in ( * ? ? ?",
    "80 - 83 ) .",
    "if compared with @xcite , where the fast ( resp .",
    "slow ) convergence behaviour is proved for @xmath4 small enough ( resp .",
    "close enough to @xmath16 ) , our result provides a sharp estimation .",
    "the slow convergence regime can be interpreted as a metastable behaviour of the model , as the process spends an exceptionally long time into a non - stable state before falling into the absorbing state .",
    "similar studies on the metastable behaviour of pca models were recently presented also in @xcite , although the methods used there do not apply in our case , as percolation pca are not reversible and do not have a naturally associated potential .",
    "numerical estimations of @xmath10 ( e.g. @xcite ) are obtained assuming that the metastable regime ( the actual regime observed in numerical simulations , as there is no way to really simulate `` infinite space '' in computers ) is observed only for all values of @xmath4 at which the infinite process is in the fluctuating phase .",
    "although this fact might appear obvious in terms of physical intuition , theorem [ theo : maintheorem2 ] provides a justification for this assumption from a rigorous mathematical point of view .",
    "the proof of our result relies almost entirely on the correspondence between percolation pca and oriented percolation in two dimensions .",
    "this connection has been described for the first time in @xcite .",
    "the proof of the statement of the theorem involving the case of @xmath9 is an application of some percolation estimations presented in @xcite .",
    "we generalize these estimates to the percolation model considered here , which differs from @xcite as here the neighbourhood is an arbitrary finite set and because sites ( instead of bonds ) can be open or closed .",
    "the proof of the statement involving the case of @xmath17 is more technical and is based on * ( 1 ) * the generalization of the dynamic - block argument provided by @xcite to the case of non symmetric neighbourhood with more than two elements and * ( 2 ) * the estimation of the probability of a certain event involving a dual lattice construction provided by @xcite .",
