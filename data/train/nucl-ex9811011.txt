    "recently , in several studies@xcite of heavy - ion - induced nuclear multifragmentation it was concluded that certain characteristics of the intermediate - mass fragment ( imf ) data are suggestive of statistical independence of multiple imf production.@xcite concepts of a binomial or a poissonian reducibility@xcite have been suggested to express the particular observed independence in mathematical terms .",
    "the concept of statistical independence or reducibility presumes that certain characteristics of multi - imf events are reflections of the single - imf production process .",
    "for example , the concept of a binomial reducibility@xcite presumes that the probability of multiple imf production is a reflection of the single - imf production probability - the two quantities of interest being connected via the expression for a binomial distribution :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the multiple - imf production probability and the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the number of ( binomial ) tries and the probability for success in any of these trials , respectively .",
    "although so far , no theoretical model has been proposed that would explain a binomial reducibility , one would reasonably expect that a successful model would at the same time link other characteristics of multi - imf events to the characteristics of single - imf production . with these expectations in mind ,",
    "the present paper investigates , to what extent the empirical systematic of multiple imf production can be derived from empirical characteristics of single - imf production and , specifically , from the single - imf transverse - energy spectrum .",
    "it is assumed in this study that the hypothesis of an independent imf production holds and that , accordingly , the total transverse - energy spectra of multiple imfs can be synthesized from the transverse - energy spectrum of a single imf .",
    "section 2 presents such a synthetic procedure , based on multiple folding of a schematic single - imf spectrum .",
    "section 3 discusses results obtained when empirical single - imf spectra are substituted for the schematic distributions used in section 2 , and section 4 discusses effects of an inclusion of transverse energies of light charged particles in the definition of the total transverse energy .",
    "an alternative synthesis method based on fragment swapping across different events of different imf multiplicity is discussed in section 5 .",
    "section 6 summarizes the findings of the present study .",
    "in the following , the total transverse energy of charged reaction products is defined as @xmath7 where the summation extends over all particles with atomic numbers @xmath8 . in the present section , only imfs with @xmath9",
    "are included in the definition of @xmath0 .",
    "effects of an inclusion of light charged particles are discussed further below , in section 4.the following empirical characteristics of multi - imf events represent the rationale behind the synthesis procedure presented in this section :    1 .",
    "the @xmath6 distributions of individual imfs are approximately exponential , with inverse logarithmic - slope parameters @xmath10 of the order of 30 to 50 mev.@xcite as an example , the experimental transverse - energy spectrum is shown in fig .  1 , for single imfs from the bi+xe reaction@xcite at @xmath11 mev .",
    "since @xmath6 is an angle - integrated quantity , the corresponding spectrum may differ from a maxwell - boltzmann shape .",
    "superimposed on the data are an exponential distribution with @xmath12 mev ( dotted line ) and a two  parameter gaussian fit ( solid line ) to the spectrum . while the exponential function deviates from the experimental spectrum both at high and low values of @xmath0 , it simplifies the following demonstration of qualitative features of total imf @xmath0 spectra .",
