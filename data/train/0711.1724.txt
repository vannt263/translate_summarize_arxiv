    "some of the theoretically most fascinating aspects of crack propagation in amorphous materials are the instabilities that are observed in well controlled laboratory experiments @xcite . besides some exceptions , ( see for example @xcite and also @xcite ) , it would be fair to say that the observed instabilities are still poorly understood .",
    "it is the opinion of the present authors that the reason for the relative lack of understanding is that the theory of crack propagation did not treat cracks as moving free boundaries whose instabilities stem from the dynamics of the free boundary itself . instead , ",
    "crack tip dynamics \" were replaced by energy balance within the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics @xcite , together with an ad - hoc `` law '' of one nature or another as to where a crack is supposed to move .    in principle",
    "this undesirable state of affairs can be greatly improved within the shear - transformation - zones ( stz ) theory of amorphous materials @xcite .",
    "this theory treats developing cracks or growing cavities as free boundaries of a material in which both elasticity and plasticity are taken into account , preserving all the symmetries and conservation laws that promise a possibly correct theory of amorphous materials driven out of mechanical equilibrium .",
    "this theory in its various appearances was compared to a number of experiments and simulations ( see below ) , with a growing confidence that although not final , stz theory is developing in the right direction . indeed , the application of a highly simplified version of stz theory to crack propagation resulted in physically interesting predictions , explaining how plasticity can intervene in blunting a crack tip and resulting in velocity selection @xcite .",
    "the application of the full fledged theory of stz to crack propagation is still daunting ( although not impossible ) due to the tensorial nature of the theory and the need to deal with an extremely stiff set of partial differential equations with a wide range of time - scales and length - scales involved .",
    "for that reason it seemed advantageous to apply the full theory to a situation in which the symmetries reduce the problem to an effectively scalar theory ; this is the problem of a circular cavity developing under circular symmetric stress boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "while this problem does not reach the extreme conditions of stress concentration that characterizes a running slender crack , it still raises many physical issues that appear also in cracks , in particular the give - and - take between elasticity and plasticity , the way stresses are transmitted to moving boundaries ( in apparent excess of the material yield stress ) and most importantly for this paper , the possible existence of dynamical instabilities of the moving free boundary .",
    "this last issue might also be connected to the difference between ductile and brittle behaviors . in the former ,",
    "a growing cavity is likely to remain rather smooth , whereas in the latter , one may expect an instability resulting in the growth of `` fingers '' , possibly ending up being cracks .",
    "it is one of the challenges of the present paper to examine whether the theory may predict a transition , as a function of material parameters or a constitutive relation , between these two types of behavior .",
    "note that we have chosen to study the problem in a purely 2-dimensional geometry ; recently quasi 2-dimensional systems exhibited interesting failure dynamics in laboratory experiments , where the 3rd dimension appears irrelevant for the observed phenomena @xcite .",
    "our motivation here is however theoretical , to reduce the unnecessary analytic and numerical complications to a minimum and to gain insight as to the main physical effects under the assumption that the thin third dimension in real systems does not induce a catastrophic change in behavior . when this assumption fails , as it does in some examples c.f .",

    "we start by writing down the full set of equations for a general two - dimensional elasto - viscoplastic material .",
    "a basic assertion of this theory is that plastic strain tensors in such materials are not state variables since their values depend on the entire history of deformation .",

    "this type of eulerian formulation has the enormous advantage that it disposes of any reference state , allowing free discussion of small or large deformations .",
    "as is required in an eulerian frame we employ the full material time derivative for a tensor @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spin tensor @xmath8 \\ . \\label{omega}\\ ] ] for a scalar or vector quantity @xmath9 the commutation with the spin tensor vanishes identically .",
    "the eulerian approach allows a natural formulation of moving free boundary problems ; this will be shown to lead to a significant advance compared to more conventional treatments .",
    "the plastic rate of deformation tensor @xmath10 is introduced by assuming that the total rate of deformation tensor @xmath11 can be written as a sum of a linear elastic and plastic contributions @xmath12 we further assume that @xmath10 is a traceless tensor , corresponding to incompressible plasticity .",
    "all possible material compressibility effects in our theory are carried by the elastic component of the deformation .",
    "the components of the linear elastic strain tensor @xmath13 are related to the components of stress tensor , whose general form is @xmath14 according to @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the two dimensional bulk and shear moduli respectively .",
    "the tensor @xmath18 is referred to hereafter as the  deviatoric stress tensor \" and @xmath19 as the pressure .",
    "the equations of motion for the velocity and density are @xmath20    in order to prepare the general set of equations for the analysis of a circular cavity we rewrite the equations in polar coordinates . for that aim",
    "we write @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are unit vectors in the radial and azimuthal directions respectively .",

    "finally , the existence of a free boundary is introduced as the following boundary conditions @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the unit normal vector at the free boundary .      up to now",
    "we have considered mainly symmetries and conservation laws . a general theoretical framework for the elasto - viscoplastic deformation dynamics of amorphous solids should be supplemented with constitutive equations relating the plastic rate of deformation tensor @xmath10 to the stress and possibly to other internal state fields .",
    "we use the constitutive equations of the recently proposed athermal shear transformation zones ( stz ) theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on identifying the internal state fields that control plastic deformation .",
    "the basic observation is that stressing a disordered solid results in localized reorganizations of groups of particles .",
    "these reorganizations occur upon surpassing a local shear threshold , and when they involve a finite irreversible shear in a given direction , we refer to them as an  stz transition \" .",
    "once transformed , due to a local redistribution of stresses , the same local region resists further deformation in that direction , but is particulary sensitive to shearing transformation if the local applied stress reverses its direction .",
    "thus an stz transition is conceived as a deformation unit that can undergo configurational rearrangements in response to driving forces .",
    "furthermore , the stress redistribution that accompanies an stz transition can induce the creation and annihilation of other local particle arrangements that can undergo further localized transitions ; these arrangements are formed or annihilated at a rate proportional to the local energy dissipation ( recall that thermal fluctuations are assumed to be absent or negligible ) . in this sense",
    "the interesting localized events need not depend on  pre - existing \" defects in the material , but can appear and disappear dynamically in a manner that we describe mathematically next .",
    "this picture is cast into a mathematical form in terms of a scalar field @xmath42 that represents the normalized density of regions that can undergo stz transitions , a tensor @xmath43 that represents the difference between the density of regions that can undergo a transition under a given stress and the reversed one , and an effective disorder temperature @xmath44 that characterizes the state of configurational disorder of the solid @xcite .",
    "the present state of the theory relates these internal state fields , along with the deviatoric stress tensor @xmath18 , to the plastic rate of deformation tensor @xmath10 according to @xmath45 this equation represents the dependence of the plastic rate of deformation on the current stress @xmath46 and the recent history encoded by the internal state tensorial field @xmath43 .",
    "this field acts as a back - stress , effectively reducing the local driving force for stz transitions , up to the possible state of jamming when the whole parentheses vanishes .",
    "the parentheses provides information about the orientation of the plastic deformation .",
    "the function @xmath47 determines the magnitude of the effect , and is re - discussed below .",
    "the field @xmath42 appears multiplicatively since the rate of plastic deformation must be proportional to the density of stz .",
    "the second equation describes the dynamics of the internal back stress field @xmath48 this equation captures the dynamical exchange of stability when the material yields to the applied stress .",
    "the equation has a jammed fixed point when the plastic deformation vanishes , in agreement with the state of stz being all in one orientation , without the production of a sufficient number of new ones in the other orientation .",
    "the jammed state is realized when the applied stress is below the yield stress .",
    "when the stress exceeds the threshold value the stable fixed point of this equation corresponds to a solution with non - vanishing plastic rate of deformation .",
    "this state corresponds to a situation where enough stz are being created per unit time to allow a persistent plastic flow .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 represents the rate of stz production in response to the flow @xmath10 .",
    "the next equation , for the density of stz @xmath42 , is an elementary fixed point equation reading @xmath50 the unique fixed point of this equation is the equilibrium solution @xmath51 where @xmath44 is a normalized temperature - like field which is not necessarily the bath temperature when the system is out of thermal and/or mechanical equilibrium .",

    "this assumption was adopted in all previous versions of stz theory .",
    "note also that a low plastic rate of deformation is associated with @xmath73 , i.e. a deviatoric stress that approaches the yield stress from above .",
