    "cellular automata are dynamical systems on a lattice with values being discrete ( usually finite ) as well .",
    "they are one of the more popular and distinctive classes of models of complex systems . introduced in various contexts @xcite around 1950",
    "they have found wide applications in different areas , from physics through chemistry and biology to social sciences @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of cellular automata is that complex patterns can emerge from very simple uptade rules .",
    "however , usually one can not easily predict how a given cellular automaton will behave without going through a number of time steps on a computer . due to their completely discrete nature , cellular automata are naturally suitable for computer simulations , but also here it would be instructive to have examples of rules with large classes of analytical solutions , integrals of motions and other `` integrable features '' .",
    "the problem of construction of integrable cellular automata is not new and was undertaken in a number of papers ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular in @xcite it was given a systematic method , called ultra - discretization , of obtainig cellular automaton version of a given discrete integrable system .",
    "recently a new approach to integrable cellular automata was proposed in @xcite .",
    "its main idea is to keep the form of a given integrable discrete system but to transfer the algebro - geometric method of construction of its solutions  @xcite from the complex field @xmath0 to a finite field .",
    "this method , which in principle can be applied to any integrable discrete system with known algebro - geometric method of solution , has been applied to the fully discrete 2d toda system ( the hirota equation ) and in @xcite to discrete kp and kdv equations ( in hirota form ) .",
    "in particular , the finite field valued multisoliton solutions of these equations have been constructed .",
    "we remark that the algebraic geometry over finite fields , although conceptually similar to that over the field of complex numbers  @xcite , has its own tools and peculiarities  @xcite .",
    "it is also nowadays very important in practical use in modern approaches to public key cryptography @xcite and in the theory of error correcting codes @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study in the finite field context the very distinguished example of integrable system  the discrete kp equation .",
    "we present the algebro - geometric scheme of construction of its solutions in a finite field and we demonstrate its linearization on the level of the abstract jacobi variety of the corresponding algebraic curve . we illustrate details of the construction on example of a hyperelliptic curve .",
    "we remark that in @xcite it was observed that the lax representation of the discrete sine - gordon equation of hirota @xcite has a meaning also when the field of complex numbers is replaced by a finite field of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a prime number .",
    "the authors of @xcite showed also that , in principle , the corresponding integrals of motion can be calculated .",
    "finally , we note that possibility of considering the soliton theory in positive characteristic has been anticipated in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : ffkp - alg - geom ]",
    "we first summarize the finite field version of krichever s construction of solutions of the discrete kp equation , then we present its abstract jacobian picture . in section [ sec : hyp ]",
    "we apply the method starting from an algebraic curve of genus two .",
    "we first briefly recall algebro - geometric construction of solutions of the discrete kp equation over finite fields @xcite .",
    "we discuss in addition a possible degeneracy of the linear problem and its consequences",
    ". then we present the jacobian picture of the construction , in which the integrable nature of the equation is evident .",
    "we point out some aspects of the representation which will help us to construct effectively solutions of the equation .",

    "in particular , in such an interpretation the zeros of @xmath38 are located in points of the translate @xmath62 of the theta divisor .",

    "their periods in variable @xmath101 are equal to @xmath102 times the order of the subgroup of @xmath99 generated by @xmath103 ( a divisor of @xmath100 ) . due to possible change of sign ( see equation ) the periods of @xmath104 can be eventually doubled with respect to the corresponding periods of @xmath95 .",
    "again , periodicity of @xmath104 implies quasi - periodicity of @xmath38 with a factor from @xmath99 , thus the period of @xmath38 in variable @xmath25 can be maximally @xmath100 times the period of @xmath104 in that variable .",
    "our goal here is to demonstrate how does the method described above work .",
    "we perform all steps of the construction ( see also @xcite for details ) starting from a given algebraic curve , which we have chosen to be a hyperelliptic curve , due to relatively simple description of jacobians of such curves  @xcite .",

    "this will not change the jacobian picture of the construction but in some situations , which we will point out , will affect uniqueness of the wave function .",
    "we remark that such a choice is indispensable in reduction of the method from the discrete kp equation to the discrete kdv equation ( see , for example @xcite ) .    to find effectively the wave function we will constraint the range of parameters from @xmath129 to the parameters of the group of @xmath109-rational points of the jacobian . let us introduce functions @xmath130 and @xmath131 corresponding to generators of the two cyclic subgroups of @xmath132 .",
