    "the scatter in the comparison to spectroscopically confirmed galaxies is larger than that derived from the simulations .",

    "furthermore , deviations from a kroupa ( 2001 ) imf would change our results on number and mass densities of massive galaxies .",
    "recently , van dokkum ( 2008 ) and dav ( 2008 ) presented evidence for an evolving imf that is more weighted to high mass stars at higher redshift . for the mass limit of @xmath79 considered in this paper , the general trend of such an evolving imf would be to lower the abundance of high - redshift galaxies above a certain mass limit , but is not trivial to implement since the change in mass - to - light ratio would depend on the galaxy s age .",
    "marchesini et al .",

    "we note however that the use of a milky way - like attenuation law from pei ( 1992 ) leads to colors intermediate between those based on the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and smc - like ( pei 1992 ) attenuation laws presented in this paper .",
    "an attenuation law that is less gray than that of the smc would be required to reproduce redder colors for dusty starburst galaxies .",

    "the simulation keeps track of the subsequent evolution in the gas metallicity , and stellar metallicities are based on the metallicity of the gas out of which they form .",

    "this allows us to disentangle the impact of scattering , birth clouds , and the multi - phase breakdown of the ism .",

    "our analysis highlights the need to understand the details of translating physical quantities to observables ( i.e. , stellar population synthesis and radiative transfer ) in order to effectively constrain models .",
    "moreover , we note that -apart from the freedom in initial gas fraction @xmath232 , which for our isolated mergers is set by hand- this issue applies equally , or perhaps more severely , to cosmological simulations , where the spatial resolution is often too limited to apply full radiative transfer .",
    "possibly , the distribution of dust in the simulated galaxies might not reflect reality .",

    "one possible mechanism that could produce such a configuration on a galactic scale is a large - scale wind .",
    "the gadget-2 code ( springel 2005b ) used to run the simulations in principle allows for such a phenomenon , but an investigation of the velocity field of the gas in the simulations is required to check whether such a wind is effectively taking place .    on much smaller scales , below the resolution of the simulations , a more effective reddening might be expected from taking into account that the molecular clouds in which new stars are formed , have a finite lifetime .",
    "so far , we ignored the role of birth clouds ( except for the comparison with sunrise radiative transfer , see  [ rt.sec ] ) , essentially assuming that they are instantaneously dispersed when new stars form .",
    "modeling the attenuation by hii and hi regions around young stars and by the ambient ism , charlot & fall ( 2000 ) came up with a simple recipe where the attenuation of light from young stars is increased threefold with respect to the attenuation of the light from old stars , until the birth clouds disperse after @xmath240 yr .",
    "however , applying this recipe as a sub - grid model , the integrated seds of the simulated galaxies do not always redden over the entire optical - to - nir wavelength range .",
    "we find that , until the star formation rate drops shortly after the final coalescence , a threefold extinction toward young stars ( @xmath241 10 myr ) reddens the integrated @xmath225 color by 0 - 0.15 mag . during the early merger phases , we observe a similar trend for the integrated @xmath224 color , with birth clouds causing a reddening of 0 - 0.1 mag .",
    "however , during the nuclear starburst , the trend is reversed and integrated @xmath224 colors bluen by 0 - 0.15 mag .",
    "the reason is that , although young stars are intrinsically bluer , the column densities to the nuclear region where the starburst takes place are so much higher that , even ignoring the attenuation by birth clouds , the young component to the integrated light is redder in @xmath224 than the old component .",
    "the balance between reddening and dimming by birth clouds subsequently reddens the already red young component , but downweights its contribution to the integrated light , thus producing a bluer overall color . at later times , the contribution of young stars is negligible , and so are the changes in the integrated colors when applying the simple recipe for birth clouds .",
    "an alternative implementation , in which birth clouds around young stars ( @xmath241 10 myr ) have a fixed @xmath242 instead of additional attenuation proportional to the line - of - sight column density through the entire galaxy , suffers from the same down - weighting of the young component to the integrated light .",
    "simple birth cloud models of the kind described in this section seem insufficient to produce the colors of dusty starbursts . as described in  [ rt.sec ] ,",
    "the more sophisticated birth cloud model adopted by sunrise causes an effective reddening of the @xmath225 and @xmath224 colors , but is also insufficient to account for the colors of observed dusty starbursts .",
    "it is very well possible that the detailed dust distribution , on scales far below the resolution of our simulations , plays a crucial role in determining the galaxy colors .",
    "the processes that govern the distribution of dust are highly complex , involving wind escape from massive stars , dust grain formation , and diffusion in the interstellar medium .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to address those issues with self - consistent numerical modeling in our galactic - scale simulations , at the moment .",
    "although the discussion in  [ rt.sec ] and this subsection does not do justice to the full complexity of the problem , it serves to highlight the uncertainties in the simulated colors .",
    "in addition , the discrepancy in colors might imply that the simulations are not characteristic for the merger activity occuring in the real universe .",
    "e.g. , from the shape of the stellar mass function it can be expected that galaxies at the high - mass end are more likely to merge with galaxies of lower rather than comparable mass ( khochfar & silk 2006 ; peng 2007 ) .",

    ", we repeated our analysis with @xmath243 instead of @xmath61 .",
    "although further gas infall is still not modeled , this test gives a crude but illustrative characterization of the dependence on the available gas reservoir and may represent differences induced by the gas accretion or evolutionary history .",
    "the @xmath238 runs represent a scenario in which most of the stars are formed during the merger . in the @xmath244",
    "runs on the other hand , the progenitor disks are more mature and a relatively smaller fraction of the final stellar mass is formed in episodes of merger - triggered star formation . the star formation history prior to the start of the simulation is assumed to be constant , and the initial metallicities of gas and stars are set according to a closed box model ( see wuyts et al .",
    "2009 for more details ) . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath239 runs do not only start with a larger fraction of the baryonic mass in stars , but also with more metal - rich gas ( @xmath245 at the start of the simulation ) and an initial stellar population having an older mass - weighted age ( on the order of 1 gyr ) and larger mass - weighted metallicity ( @xmath246 ) .    in broad terms",
    ", our conclusions remain unaltered when lowering the adopted @xmath232 from 0.8 to 0.4 .",
    "especially the results regarding the post - quasar phase seem robust , since by that time the stellar mass evolution of the low and high gas fraction runs have converged and most of the sensitivity to the initial conditions has been washed out . in other words ,",
    "the post - quasar systems have distinctly lower @xmath139 values than the earlier evolutionary stages , their uvj colors lie in the selection wedge that was designed to select the observed quiescent galaxies , and , as for the @xmath247 results , we find that the model prediction for their number and mass density as derived from the observed quasar luminosity function exceeds the observed abundance by a factor of @xmath248 .    for the model predictions of the star - forming population , the following dependencies on @xmath232 are observed .",
    "first , in the @xmath239 runs more stars already formed prior to the merger - triggered star formation phase .",
    "some systems in the early stages of merging , that in the @xmath238 realization had not built up a sufficient amount of mass to enter the sample , will now fall above the mass limit , hence boosting the model prediction and reducing the discrepancy with respect to the abundance of observed massive star - forming galaxies by a factor @xmath249 .",
    "second , the initial conditions affect the intrinsic photometry of simulated merging galaxies by the increased age and metallicity of the stellar population , and the attenuated photometry is affected also by the smaller amount and larger metal - content of the gas . the presence of an old underlying population and relatively smaller build - up of new stars during the merger explains why the tail towards blue @xmath4 and especially blue @xmath3 colors ( see fig .",
    "[ uvhist.fig ] and fig.[vjhist.fig ] ) is lacking in the color distribution realized with @xmath250 .",
    "for our default bc03 models , we find the @xmath3 color distribution for the entire ( pre- and post - quasar ) population to range from 1 to 2 with the central 68% interval bracketed by @xmath251 .",
    "the @xmath4 distribution ranges from 0.5 to 1.6 , with a narrow central 68% interval of @xmath252 .",
    "the dependence on population synthesis code and attenuation law is similar as for the higher @xmath232 runs .",
    "e.g. , using m05 models we find a @xmath4 distribution ranging from 1 to 2 ( central 68% interval @xmath253 ) .",
    "we conclude that the discrepancy with respect to the optical - to - nir colors of observed dusty starbursts is not alleviated by adopting a different initial gas fraction .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sunrise.fig ] .      alternatively , it is possible that dusty starburst galaxies are not triggered by mergers , but had a different evolutionary history .",
    "daddi et al .",
    "( 2007a ) make this claim based on the long star formation timescales of ulirgs at high redshift , and the relatively tight relation between sfr and stellar mass .",
    "we note , however , that our simulations of isolated disk galaxies with initial conditions identical to those of the merger progenitors also fail to produce actively star - forming systems with colors similar to dusty red starbursts . while co interferometry by tacconi et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2008 ) shows key evidence that major merging is taking place in essentially all smgs , the merger fraction among the general @xmath98 star - forming population may be lower .",

    "( 2008 ) finds a third of @xmath98 star - forming galaxies to be undergoing major merging , consistent with our model prediction .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have suggested that most of the gas accretion at the high - mass end takes place in cold flows along dark matter filaments , with the streams being @xmath255% smoothly flowing material , and the other @xmath255% in clumps of mass ratio @xmath256 with respect to the accreting system ( keres et al . 2005 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ; ocvirk et al .",
    "2008 ; dekel et al .",
    "2009 ) . unlike major mergers",
    ", such flows could keep the rotating disk configuration observed in many star - forming @xmath100 galaxies intact . using a semi - analytic model with star formation and feedback recipes based on hydrodynamic simulations , somerville et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also find that most of the global star formation occurs in a quiescent mode , rather than in merger - induced starbursts .",
    "this could explain why our model prediction for the abundance of merger - triggered star - forming galaxies accounts for only a third of all observed star - forming galaxies at the high - mass end ( see  [ sf.sec ] and  [ biassed.sec ] ) .",
    "we conclude that , while our results are consistent with a scenario where all massive quiescent galaxies at @xmath0 have formed by a merging event that triggered quasar activity , it leaves room for other mechanisms than major mergers contributing significantly to the @xmath100 star - forming population . it would be interesting to scrutinize such alternative scenarios in the same way as presented here .",
    "gas replenishment from mass loss and infall of gas from the intergalactic environment could change the optical depths and thus the reddening factors .",
    "the simulations only take into account a small amount of mass loss : 10% of the gas mass converted into stars is instantaneously returned to the interstellar medium , accounting for short - lived stars that die as supernovae ( springel & hernquist 2003 ) . the total fraction of the mass lost by an aging single stellar population with salpeter ( 1955 ) imf amounts to @xmath257 ( bc03 ) and is even higher ( @xmath258 ) for more realistic imfs such as kroupa ( 2001 ) or chabrier ( 2003 ) . furthermore",
    ", the simulations do not allow for infall of primordial gas at later times .",
    "consequently , they can not prove that descendants of galaxies that once showed up in the quasar luminosity function and after the shutdown of star formation reached red colors , will remain quiescent forever .",
    "small amounts of newly accreted gas triggering star formation may be enough to shift a post - quasar galaxy outside the quiescent region of color - color space defined by eq .",
    "[ colsel.eq ] , thus dropping their contribution to the observed galaxy population of massive quiescent red galaxies .",
    "cosmological simulations at sufficient resolution might resolve this problem . at the very least",
    ", it would be interesting to test the behavior of simulated merger remnants hosting a supermassive black hole when a small but continuous gas supply is applied .",
    "we note that a rejuvenation of part of the post - quasar population would simultaneously improve the agreement with the observations for both the star - forming and the quiescent galaxy abundance .      from the observational side , cosmic variance is the dominant source random of uncertainties for the determination of the number and mass density of massive galaxies . at @xmath111 ,",
    "this is even the case when including the wider area musyc survey ( marchesini et al .",
    "this is particularly true for the quiescent population , that shows a stronger clustering than the star - forming one ( williams et al .",
    "surveys over a significantly larger area than fires and goods - south , but probing similar depths at optical - to - mir wavelengths , are required to better constrain the fraction of massive quiescent galaxies that post - quasar galaxies can account for . the ultravista survey by dunlop",
    ", franx , fynbo , & lefvre will provide nir imaging over half of the 2 square degrees cosmos field to an unprecedented depth . in combination with very deep irac imaging during the warm spitzer mission",
    ", such multi - wavelength surveys will allow to simultaneously probe further down the mass function of quiescent galaxies , and reduce the effect of cosmic variance .",
    "we confronted the model by hopkins et al .",
    "( 2006b ) with observations of massive galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "the model translates the observed quasar luminosity function into the abundance of massive merging galaxies and merger remnants .",
    "we derived the synthetic photometry for these systems from a set of binary merger sph simulations by robertson et al .",
    "( 2006a , 2006b ) and t. j. cox , with a range of masses , and including stellar and agn feedback .",
    "we extracted mass - limited samples of @xmath0 galaxies with @xmath112 and @xmath86 from the fires+fireworks and fires+fireworks+musyc surveys respectively .",
    "we tested the model by comparing the predicted number and mass densities , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 color distributions , and @xmath139 versus mass distribution with our observations of massive galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the overall number density of galaxies with @xmath259 in the fires and goods - south fields ( @xmath260 at @xmath200 and @xmath261 at @xmath5 ) is consistent within the uncertainties with the model prediction ( @xmath262 at @xmath200 and @xmath263 at @xmath5 ) . likewise ,",
    "the results obtained for the mass density are consistent : @xmath264 at @xmath200 and @xmath265 at @xmath5 for the observations and @xmath266 at @xmath267 and @xmath268 at @xmath209 .    separating massive galaxies by type , we find that the model photometry of the post - quasar population coincides with the region of @xmath3 versus @xmath4 color - color space that was defined by labb et al .",
    "( in preparation ) to select quiescent red galaxies .",
    "the modeled number and mass densities of massive ( @xmath269 ) quiescent galaxies is consistent with the observations at @xmath5 , but somewhat larger ( 2 - 3 times ) than observed at @xmath267 .",
    "the results based on the uvj diagnostic diagram and on a mips - based @xmath139 threshold are consistent .",
    "we added the musyc survey to our sample , increasing the area by a factor of 3.6 , but by the shallower depth restricting our analysis to @xmath35 galaxies . from this sample , we derive qualitatively similar results .    although less constrained , the predicted abundances of galaxies with merger - triggered star formation ( according to their uvj colors or @xmath140 can also account for a significant fraction of the observed actively star - forming galaxies ( one third when using masses based on bc03 templates and taking into account biases in sed modeling ) .",
    "however , the predicted color distribution of star - forming galaxies does not match the observations .",
    "in particular the colors of red ( @xmath125 ) dusty starburst galaxies are not reproduced .",
    "we suggest a number of explanations for the lack of dusty red starburst galaxies in the model predictions .",
    "possible reasons are an incomplete simulation of the observing procedure , differences in stellar population properties or merger characteristics between the observed and simulated galaxies , a different history for dusty starbursts than a merger - triggered scenario , infall of additional gas ( and dust ) from the intergalactic environment or mass loss , and a different distribution of the dust , e.g. , caused by the presence of large - scale outflows or birthclouds around young stars .      we conclude that the star formation in remnants of merger simulations is quenched abruptly , leading to colors that correspond well to those of observed massive galaxies with a quiescent stellar population . using a merger rate derived from the observed quasar luminosity function ,",
    "we obtain number and mass densities of the quiescent population at @xmath0 that are consistent within a factor of 2 to 3 with the observations .",
    "possibly , the overprediction at @xmath200 suggests the need to include gas infall as refinement to the model . the predicted abundance of merger - triggered star - forming systems accounts for 30 - 50% of the observed star - forming population , leaving ample room for other star formation mechanisms than major merging .",
    "the most serious challenge to the model is posed by the color distribution of star - forming galaxies , which is not well reproduced .",
    "the detailed dust distribution , on a galaxy - wide scale and/or scales far below the resolution of the simulation , may well cause this problem . with this work",

    "<S> that relates the quasar and galaxy population on the basis of gas - rich mergers . in order to test the hypothesis that quiescent red galaxies are formed after a gas - rich merger involving quasar activity , we confront photometry of massive ( @xmath1 ) galaxies extracted from the fires , goods - south , and musyc surveys , together spanning an area of 496 arcmin@xmath2 , with synthetic photometry from hydrodynamical merger simulations . as in the hopkins </S>",
    "<S> et al . ( 2006b ) model , we use the observed quasar luminosity function to estimate the merger rate . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the synthetic @xmath3 and @xmath4 colors of galaxies that had a quasar phase in their past match the colors of observed galaxies that are best characterized by a quiescent stellar population . at @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> the observed number and mass density of quiescent red galaxies with @xmath6 is consistent with the model in which every quiescent massive galaxy underwent a quasar phase in the past . at @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> 2.8 times less quiescent galaxies are observed than predicted by the model as descendants of higher redshift quasars . </S>",
    "<S> the merger model also predicts a large number and mass density of galaxies undergoing star formation driven by the merger . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the predicted number and mass density accounts for 30 - 50% of the observed massive star - forming galaxies . however </S>",
    "<S> , their colors do not match those of observed star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the colors of dusty red galaxies ( accounting for 30 - 40% of the massive galaxy population ) are not reproduced by the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> several possible origins of this discrepancy are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the observational constraints on the validity of the model are currently limited by cosmic variance and uncertainties in stellar population synthesis and radiative transfer . </S>"
