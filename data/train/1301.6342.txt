    "the recently discovered high temperature superconductors ( high-@xmath1 ) , iron - based superconductors@xcite , are layered materials with complicated electronic structures .",
    "the complexity causes a major difficulty in understanding pairing symmetry which arguably is the most important property and clue to determine pairing mechanism@xcite .    in a strongly correlated electron system",
    ", major physics is determined locally in real space .",
    "important properties , such as pairing symmetry in a superconducting state , are expected to be robust against small variation of fermi surfaces in reciprocal space .",
    "although superconducting mechanism related to high temperature superconductors ( high @xmath1 ) is still unsettled , the robust d - wave pairing symmetry in cuprates@xcite can be understood under this principle .",
    "is this principle still held for iron - based superconductors ?",
    "namely , do all iron - based superconductors possess one universal pairing state ?",
    "unlike cuprates , the answer to this question is highly controversial because different theoretical approaches have provided different answers and no universal state has been identified@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as local electronic structures in all families of iron - based superconductors are almost identical and phase diagrams are smooth against doping@xcite , it is hard to argue that the materials can approach many different superconducting ground states .    in conventional wisdom",
    ", there are several obvious requirements regarding electron pairing in superconducting states .",
    "first , pairing symmetry is known to be classified according to lattice symmetry .",
    "second , in a uniform superconducting state , the total momentum for the cooper pairs ( modulo a reciprocal lattice vector ) must be vanished .",
    "finally , for a central symmetric lattice with a space inversion center , the parity of superconducting order parameters normally is even for a spin - singlet pairing and odd for a spin - triplet pairing@xcite .",
    "these requirements are easily fulfilled in a system with a simple electronic structure , such as cuprates . however , for iron - based superconductors , they are highly non - trivial .",
    "the unit cell in iron - based superconductors is intrinsically a 2-fe unit cell while for simplicity , most theoretical models are effectively constructed based on an 1-fe unit cell@xcite .",
    "obviously , these effective models have different lattice symmetry from the models defined on the original lattice .",
    "the difference may cause serious problems .",
    "for example , in the effective models , the pairings have been limited to two electrons with opposite momentum @xmath2 , which we call it normal pairing in this paper , where @xmath3 is momentum defined with respect to the 1-fe unit cell in an iron square lattice .",
    "the momentum vector @xmath4 is a reciprocal lattice vector in the original lattice with a 2-fe unit cell .",
    "thus , the pairings ( @xmath5 ) , in principle , are also allowed according to the above second requirements .",
    "we will refer this pairing channel as an extended @xmath0-pairing@xcite and simply call it @xmath0-pairing in this paper .",
    "the possible existence of @xmath0-pairing was discussed in simplified models@xcite .",
    "as order parameters are classified differently under different symmetry groups , we need to understand these orders under the original lattice symmetry .",
    "otherwise , conseration laws could be violated .    in this paper , we show that the superconducting state in iron - based superconductors is a new state of matter which is classified as an odd parity s - wave spin - singlet pairing state in a single trilayer feas / se , the building block of the materials . the superconducting states that were proposed in the past based on the effective d - orbital models of an iron square lattice are not parity eigenstates .",
    "parity conservation was violated .",
    "we show that the superconducting state which conserves parity includes both normal pairing between two sublattices of the iron square lattice and @xmath0-pairing within each sublattices .",
    "the states have a fingerprint with a real space sign inversion between the top and bottom as / se layers .",
    "our derivation is based on general symmetry and gauge requirements on the effective models for iron - based superconductors .    in the following ,",
    "we first provide a complete symmetry analysis for pairing symmetries in iron - based superconductors .",
    "while the pairing symmetries can be classified according to @xmath6 point group at iron sites or @xmath7 point group at the center of an iron square , there are two types of pairing symmetries for a spin - singlet pairing state because of the intrinsic 2-fe unit cell .",
    "they are distinguished from each other by opposite parity numbers .",
    "second , we discuss the hidden symmetry properties of the effective models under the original lattice symmetry . we show that the effective hopping terms between two sublattices and within each sublattice have different symmetry characters .",
    "third , we discuss a general gauge principle related to the definition of pairing symmetries and conclude that parity conservation was violated in the past .",
    "we provide the meanfield hamiltonian in the new superconducting state and show that it can provide a unified description of all families of iron - based superconductors including both iron - pnictides@xcite and iron - chalcognides@xcite .",
    "fourth , we discuss the smoking - gun experiments that can reveal the parity of the superconducting state . finally , we discuss the fundamental impact on high @xmath1 superconducting mechanism if it is confirmed .",
    "before we start the main content , we first make clear about a gauge setting for the effective models that were constructed based on all five iron @xmath8-orbitals@xcite . in those effective models with an 1-fe unit cell ,",
    "a new gauge setting is taken@xcite , which effectively changes the momentum @xmath3 to @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 orbitals . in the following , without further clarification , the momentum @xmath12 used in the definition of our normal pairing @xmath13 and @xmath0-pairing @xmath14 is the same momentum used in those papers rather than the momentum in a natural gauge setting .",
    "iron - based superconductors are layered materials . the essential electronic physics is controlled by a single trilayer fe - as(se ) structure , the building block of the superconductors .",
    "although the coupling along c - axis between the building blocks has many interesting effects , the superconducting mechanism and the fundamental properties of the superconducting states , such as pairing symmetries , are expected to be solely determined within the single building block .",
    "the observation of superconductivity in a single fese layer grown by mbe has further justified this two - dimensional nature@xcite .",
    "therefore , we first focus on the study of a single fe - as(se ) trilayer structure .",
    "we start our analysis by understanding the lattice symmetry . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the structure has an inversion center , the origin , located at the middle of each fe - fe link .",
    "the unit cell with the origin at the center is marked by the shadowed area , which includes two irons and two as / se atoms .",
    "we denote @xmath15 as the translation group with respect to the unit cell .",
    "the symmetry group , thus , is described by a non - symmorphic space group @xmath16@xcite . the quotient group @xmath17 is specified by 16 symmetry operations that include a space inversion @xmath18 .",
    "it is easy to check that these operations can be specified equivalently as @xmath19 or @xmath20 , where @xmath7 is the point group with respect to the point at the middle of an iron square and @xmath6 is the point group defined at an iron site .",
    "it is important to note that both @xmath7 and @xmath6 are not defined with respect to the inversion center .",
    "therefore , some symmetry operations in @xmath7 or @xmath6 are non - symmorphic .",
    "for example , the @xmath21 rotation operation in @xmath7 is equivalent to @xmath22 , which represents @xmath23 , an rotation @xmath24 along z - axis at the inversion center , followed by a translation operation @xmath25 that translates @xmath26 in the coordinate of an iron square lattice , a half of unit lattice cell along @xmath27 direction labeled in fig.1 .    in summary , the full symmetry group can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the group is a direct product of two subgroups which are defined with respect to different operation centers .",
    "@xmath18 commutates with all symmetry operations in @xmath6 or @xmath7 in a sense that operations are considered to be identical if they only differ by a lattice transition with respect to the 2-fe unit cell .",
    "the pairing symmetry of a translation invariant superconducting state is classified by the irs of @xmath17 .",
    "if we ignore spin - orbital coupling , the ground state is expected to be a parity eigenstate .",
    "since spin - singlet pairing is overwhelmingly supported experimentally in iron - based superconductors@xcite , we focus on spin - singlet pairing states .    conventionally , for a spin - singlet pairing state",
    ", the parity is even .",
    "however , due to the unit cell doubling , the parity operation here essentially takes mapping between two sublattices , a and b , in the iron square lattice as shown in fig.1 .",
    "therefore there is no parity constraint for the pairing within each sublattice governed by @xmath6 .",
    "thus , for each irreducible representation of @xmath6 , there are two different pairing states with opposite parities .",
    "the irs of @xmath17 are direct product of the irs of two subgroups .",
    "the character table of the @xmath6 group is shown in table.[character_c4v ] .",
    "there are five different irs with four being one - dimensional , a and b , and one being two - dimensional , e.    .character table for @xmath6 point group . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let s consider the symmetry operation @xmath30 in @xmath6 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the reflection along z - axis and @xmath33 is an in - plane translation by @xmath34 , namely one iron - iron lattice distance .",
    "eq.[ea1 ] leads to an extremely important conclusion : the parity is determined by the eigenvalues of operation ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "it is equal to or opposite to the eigenvalues for one - dimensional ( a and b ) or two - dimensional ( e ) irs respectively because @xmath36 for one - dimensional irs and @xmath37 for two - dimensional irs .",
    "more specifically , this conclusion leads to that the pairing is translation invariant with respect to 1-fe unit cell in the a or b state when the parity is even and in the e state when the parity is odd .",
    "the @xmath0-pairing takes place in the a or b state with odd parity and in the e state with even parity .",
    "the above classification is independent of the number of orbitals and orbital characters as long as we have the gauge setting specified for @xmath10 and @xmath11 mentioned earlier .",
    "it is also important to note that the classifications with respect to @xmath6 at iron sites or @xmath7 at the center of iron squares are equivalent in a sense that they can be mapped to each other .",
    "@xmath7 has the same number and type of irs as @xmath6 .",
    "we notice the following important relation , @xmath38 where @xmath21 is the @xmath39 rotation operation in @xmath7 . for one - dimensional irs in @xmath6 ,",
    "the above equation reduces to @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , for parity even pairing , namely normal pairing , there is no difference whether states are classified according to @xmath6 or @xmath7 since @xmath41 .",
    "namely , a normal pairing state has the same irs with respect to both @xmath7 and @xmath6 . for parity odd @xmath0-pairing , @xmath42 , which implies that an s - wave state classified by @xmath43-irs in @xmath6 must become an d - wave state classified by @xmath44-irs in @xmath7 . for example",
    ", an @xmath0-pairing @xmath45 s - wave state classified in @xmath6 belongs to the @xmath46 d - wave in @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , for an @xmath0-pairing parity odd state , the name of the state depends on how it is classified . for above example",
    ", one can either name the @xmath0-pairing state as @xmath47 d - wave or @xmath48 s - wave , depending on the classification point groups @xmath7 or @xmath6 respectively .",
    "an odd parity superconducting state must have a sign change between the top and bottom as / se layers .",
    "however , this information is hidden in an effective model with only d - orbitals constructed on an iron square lattice . from above symmetry analysis",
    ", we can track the parity information simply using @xmath32 .",
    "although @xmath32 is not a symmetry operation for a single fe - as(se ) trilayer , the @xmath0-pairing state can be viewed as a state with _ an internal negative iso - spin defined by @xmath49_. for any normal pairing , @xmath50 and @xmath0-pairing @xmath51 order parameters which belong to one - dimensional irs of @xmath6 , we have",
    "@xmath52    we can extend above discussion for order parameters in a bulk material .",
    "there are two different lattice structures along c - axis in iron - based superconductors , 11-type ( which includes 111(@xmath53 ) and 1111(@xmath54 ) structures ) and 122-type where the 11-type is translation invariant along c - axis while the 122-type is not .    for the 11-type , we can simply extend above analysis to the nearest - neighbour ( nn ) inter - layer pairing .",
    "for an even parity order parameters , we can have two possible terms : @xmath2 pairing which is proportional to @xmath55 and the @xmath0-pairing @xmath56 which is proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "for an odd parity order parameters , the two possible terms become @xmath2 pairing which is proportional to @xmath57 and the @xmath0-pairing @xmath56 which is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "both terms can be in a same irreducible representations of @xmath6 .    for the 122-type ,",
    "the situation is rather different because the 122 structure has a symmorphic space group @xmath58 with a point group @xmath59 centered in the middle of two nn fe - as(se ) layers .",
    "the translation symmetry is specified by @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . the space inversion and @xmath32",
    "have identical characters in any one - dimensional irs . a state with odd parity which belongs to one - dimensional irs must have node lines on fermi surfaces when @xmath63",
    "therefore , we are only allowed to construct even parity states . for the intra - layer pairing",
    ", there are two different even parity order parameters : one is constructed by @xmath2 pairing and the other is constructed by @xmath64 pairing where @xmath65 , namely the @xmath0-pairing .",
    "the difference between these two order parameters is that the latter breaks @xmath61 and @xmath62 translation symmetry . now if we consider the nn inter - layer pairing , we can have two terms which are parity even and keep the translation symmetry : the normal pairing @xmath2 which is proportional to @xmath55 and @xmath56 pairing which is proportional to @xmath57 . here",
    "we refer @xmath66 . for the @xmath64 @xmath0-pairing ,",
    "there are also two terms in the nn inter - layer pairing : the @xmath0-pairing @xmath64 proportional to @xmath55 and @xmath56 pairing proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , if the inter - layer pairing is included , the superconducting state generally breaks translation symmetry of the iron - square lattice .",
    "the above symmetry analysis is based on the original lattice symmetry . as we mentioned above ,",
    "an effective model based on d - orbitals appears to have a different symmetry . in the past studies",
    ", we treated the model in 1-fe unit cell with a @xmath59 point group at iron sites .",
    "the treatment , in general , violated the fundamental spirit of symmetry principle and might have resulted in fundamental errors . to pay a full respect to symmetry principle",
    ", we must understand the symmetry properties of the effective model under the original lattice symmetry .",
    "we consider a general hamiltonian in a single trilayer @xmath67 structure coordinated by fe and as(se ) atoms , @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 describe the direct hopping between two d - orbitals , the @xmath72 hybridization between fe and as(se ) and the direct hopping between two p - orbitals respectively .",

    "the reason of sign change for @xmath76 between ( a ) and ( b ) is that the @xmath78 orbitals in top layer and bottom layer form occupied bonding states in ( a ) and empty anti - bonding states in ( b ) .",

    "an effective hamiltonian is obtained by integrating out @xmath80-orbitals , which can be written as @xmath81 the effective band structure can be written as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the effective hopping induced through d - p hybridization .",
    "@xmath84 has been obtained by many groups@xcite .",
    "the major effective hopping terms in @xmath83 can be divided into two parts @xmath85 , which describes nn hopping and @xmath86 , which describes nnn hoppings in the iron square lattice .",

    "we see that the hopping parameter @xmath74 must be negative .",
    "however the effective hopping parameter , @xmath76 , is positive and even larger than @xmath89 in @xcite . in a tetragonal lattice",
    ", @xmath76 can only be generated through @xmath90 hybridization .",
    "a positive value of @xmath76 suggests that virtual hopping which generates @xmath76 must go through an unoccupied @xmath78 state .",

    "it is also easy to check that the effective nnn hoppings between @xmath87 orbitals are dominated through an occupied @xmath80 states , which is primarily a bonding state of @xmath80 -orbitals .",
    "therefore , the nn effective hoppings are generated through @xmath91 hybridization , where @xmath92 represents an anti - bonding p - orbital states and the nnn effective hoppings are generated through @xmath93 hybridization where @xmath94 is the bonding p - state .",
    "the above microscopic understanding is not surprising .",
    "in fact , it is known in lda calculations@xcite that p - orbitals in as / se are not fully occupied and there are significant overlappings between p - orbitals on bottom and top as / se layers . moreover , since @xmath88 and @xmath95 primarily affect hole pockets around @xmath96 and electron pockets at @xmath97 separately , we can check the distribution of anti - bonding p states and bonding p states in band structure to further confirm the analysis . in fig.[fig2](a ) , we plot the band structure of fese and the distribution of @xmath80 orbitals .",

    "[ fig2 ] ]    knowing the above hidden microscopic origins in a derivation of an effective hamiltonian allows us to understand the symmetry characters of the effective hamiltonian in the original lattice symmetry .",
    "the @xmath91 hybridization is odd under @xmath98 while the @xmath93 hybridization is even under @xmath98 .",
    "thus , the nn hopping @xmath88 and nnn hopping @xmath86 should be classified as odd and even under @xmath32 respectively .",
    "namely , @xmath99 the above hidden symmetry property is against the main assumption taken in many weak coupling approaches , which assume that the essential physics is driven by the interplay between hole pockets at @xmath96 and electron pockets at @xmath97 @xcite . as indicated in fig.[fig2](a ) , the interplay between the hole and electron pockets must be minimal because of their distinct microscopic origins .",
    "the symmetry difference in eq.[symmetry ] has fundamental impact on how to consider the parity of a superconducting state if superconducting pairing is driven by local d - p hybridization .",
    "it has been shown that in a system where short range pairings in real space dominate , superconducting order parameters are momentum dependent and a gauge principle must be satisfied because the phases of superconducting order parameters can be exchanged with those of the local hopping parameters@xcite by gauge transformations . as an example",
    ", a d - wave superconducting state in cuprates can be mapped to a s - wave superconducting state by a gauge mapping which changes the hopping terms from s - type symmetry to d - type symmetry@xcite .",
    "therefore , only the combined symmetry of hopping terms and pairing orders associated to them is a gauge - independent symmetry character to classify superconducting states .",

    "if @xmath104 is a normal pairing , we immediately conclude that the state is parity odd and the superconducting order @xmath108 must be an @xmath0-pairing .",
    "the above analysis can be easily illustrated in real space .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig3 ] , if superconducting pairing is driven by local d - p hybridization , the superconducting order is a pairing between d and p orbitals @xmath109 . a uniform @xmath110 is parity odd .",
    "the nn pairing , @xmath111 in the effective model , must originate from @xmath110 and thus is also parity odd .",
    "the gauge principle can be understood as shown in fig.[fig1](c , d ) . if we can take a new gauge for fermion operators of p - orbitals , @xmath112 , in one of the two as(se ) layers , the anti - bonding operator @xmath113 maps to the bonding operator @xmath114 .",
    "this gauge mapping exactly transfers the parity between hopping terms and superconducting order parameters .",
    "the above analysis can be generalized to all effective hoppings .",
    "the basic idea is to divide the iron square lattice into two sublattices . in an odd parity state",

    ", the pairing between two sublattices must be @xmath0-pairing while the pairing within sublattices must be normal pairing .",

    ", the normal pairing order parameters must satisfy @xmath120 all superconducting states derived before from weak coupling approaches were considered as even parity@xcite .",

    "the superconducting order was derived from nnn antiferromagnetic exchange coupling @xmath121 , which is a normal pairing within sublattices , satisfies eq.[even - mf ] .",
    "therefore , if superconductivity is only originated from @xmath121 , the proposed state is an even parity s - wave state , namely , the @xmath122 s - wave .",
    "this state provides a good understanding of superconducting gaps in iron - based superconductors .",

    "the high - symmetry points are shown in ( a ) and the pairing channels connecting the points on the fermi surface are denoted by the black lines with arrows .",
    "the quasi - particle spectrum of the superconductive states for ( a ) and ( b ) are shown in ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "we can find the ( c ) is full gaped and ( d ) has nodes at the electron pockets .",
    "the superconductive order parameters are chosen : @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 ]",
    "the fingerprint of the odd parity state is the negative iso - spin of @xmath32 , which indicates the sign change of order parameters between top and bottom as(se ) layers .",
    "this property was first revealed in the recent constructed effective @xmath136 symmetry model based on the 2-fe unit cell@xcite .",
    "however , as the @xmath136 model is a simplified effective model based on two effective orbitals , the parity characters were not revealed .",
    "the odd parity indicates that a superconducting single fe - as(as ) trilayer is a @xmath137-junction along c - axis , which can be measured in a single crystal material as shown in fig.[sign ] : a uniform superconducting state is characterized by sign change between top and bottom surfaces along c - axis in 11-type structure while in the 122-type structure , the sign change only presents when the number of layers are odd .",
    "in the history of condensed matter physics , a new quantum state of condensed matter is hardly obtained by solving a model .",
    "here we use fundamental principles to show that an odd parity state can be naturally taken place in iron - based superconductors and suggest smoking - gun experiments to detect or falsify it . with microscopic understanding proposed here",
    ", a detection of the odd parity state can have a tremendous impact on high @xmath1 mechanism for iron - based superconductors and other high @xmath1 superconductors .    in the past five years , many researches based on effective models suggest that pairing symmetries in iron - based superconductors are very fragile .",
    "those studies essentially suggest that principles to understand the robustness of superconductivity and pairing symmetry are still missed in our standard approach .",
    "the results in this paper demonstrate that previous studies did not correctly take parity conservation and hidden symmetry in effective models into account and mishandled symmetry and gauge principles . in the past",
    ", the effective hamiltonian was viewed in the symmetry group @xmath59 at iron sites rather than the original lattice symmetry @xmath138 .",
    "we can see that if @xmath32 could be set to one , @xmath138 is equivalent to @xmath59 .",
    "however , due to the anti - bonding @xmath80 orbital states , the effective hamiltonian does not represent correct symmetry of the original lattice in a natural gauge setting .",
    "it will be interesting to see how the missing pieces can be properly implemented in our standard methods .",
    "our results suggest that gauge principle needs to be properly implemented when we derive effective hamiltonian to simplify a complex system .",
    "the correct physics can only be understood after the hidden gauge is revealed . for an order parameter which is momentum dependent",
    ", this gauge information is critical .",
    "the gauge principle becomes very important for us to search new physics in other complex electron systems .",
    "the odd parity state also suggests the importance of correlated electron physics .",
    "it is believed that sign change superconducting order is inevitable in a superconducting state of strongly correlated electron systems because of the existence of strong repulsive interaction .",
    "this principle is violated in a parity even s - wave state .",
    "a measurement of the party odd s - wave state can provide a strong support of this principle .",
    "the microscopic mechanism revealed here fundamentally differs from those proposed in weak coupling approaches which only emphasize fermi surfaces .",
    "fermi surfaces are only determined by energy dispersion .",
    "it provides no information about underlining microscopic processes which are local and bound with high energy physics . in correlated electron systems , these processes essentially determine many important properties .",
    "this is also the reason why iron - pnictides and iron - chalcogenides can be unified even if their fermi surfaces are drastically different .",
    "if the odd parity state is confirmed , the fundamental objects in superconducting states of high @xmath1 materials must be the tightly binding cooper pairs between d and p orbitals . in this view",
    ", the odd parity s - wave state closely resembles the d - wave state in a cu - o plane of cuprates .",
    "we expect an identical mechanism to select sign changed superconducting orders in both materials . from fig.[fig3](b )",
    ", one can see that the @xmath0-pairing part in the odd parity state can be viewed as two d - wave states formed in two sublattices , a direct analogy to the d - wave in cuprates .",
    "this study opens a promising new direction for the research in iron - based superconductors and suggests that the physics in these materials is deeper and much more inspiring than what we realized before .",
    "it leaves many unanswered questions for us .",
    "a few questions are in order .",
    "first , what is relationship between magnetism and superconductivity ?",
    "one can see that the collinear antiferromagnetic ( c - afm ) state@xcite observed in iron - pnictides has odd parity .",
    "this may partially answer why superconductivity and c - afm order can coexist in the phase diagram .",
    "second , what are other unique properties in an odd parity s - wave state ?",
    "it is known that an odd parity p - wave state displays many unique properties .",
    "third , what is the relationship between nematism and superconductivity ?",
    "nematism breaks rotational symmetry and was observed at high temperature@xcite .",
    "fourth , how robust is an odd parity state in response to impurity ? finally , this study points out that there are three possible scenarios related to parity in superconducting states , even , odd or broken .",
    "experiments proposed here will finally nail down the truth .",
    "all the previous studies took even parity for granted without knowing that the parity was acturally broken in the proposed states .",
    "however , a parity breaking superconducting state is also an interesting state to explore .    in summary , using symmetry and gauge principles",
    ", we show that iron - based superconductors are unified into an odd parity s - wave superconducting state .",
    "we demonstrate that in an effective model based on d - orbitals , superconducting states studied in the past violate parity conservation .",
    "the existence of the odd parity state can have tremendous impact on high @xmath1 superconducting mechanism .",
