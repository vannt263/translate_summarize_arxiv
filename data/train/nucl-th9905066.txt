    "the @xmath0b isotope produced in the sun via the radiative capture reaction @xmath2be(p,@xmath3)@xmath0b is the principal source of the high energy neutrinos detected in the super - kamiokande and @xmath11cl detectors  @xcite .",
    "in fact the calculated rate of events in the former detector ( and also in the sno experiment  @xcite ) is directly proportional to the rate of this reaction measured in the laboratory at low energies ( @xmath10 20 kev ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the measured cross sections ( at relative energies ( @xmath12 ) of [ @xmath9 @xmath13 200 kev ) disagree in absolute magnitude and the value extracted by extrapolating the data in the region of 20 kev differ from each other by 30 - 40 @xmath8 .",
    "this makes the rate of the reaction @xmath2be(@xmath14b most poorly known quantity in the entire nucleosynthesis chain leading to the formation of @xmath0b  @xcite .",
    "the coulomb dissociation ( cd ) method provides an alternative indirect way to determine the cross sections for the radiative capture reactions at low energies  @xcite . in this method , the radiative capture is reversed by the dissociation of the projectile ( the fused system ) in the coulomb field of the target by assuming that the strong interaction between the nuclei is absent and the electromagnetic excitation process is dominated by a single multipolarity ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "however , in the cd of @xmath0b , the contributions of @xmath5 and @xmath4 multipolarities as well as nuclear breakup can be disproportionately enhanced in certain kinematical regimes  @xcite and a careful investigation  @xcite is necessary to isolate the conditions in which these terms have negligible effect on the calculated breakup cross sections .    for the cd measurements of @xmath0b performed at riken  @xcite at around 50 mev / nucleon , it was found in a theoretical model@xcite that the data are free from nuclear and @xmath5 contributions if measurements are limited to @xmath12 @xmath15 0.70 mev and to angles of @xmath16be c.m . with respect to the beam direction ( @xmath17 ) @xmath154@xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , for measurements at subcoulomb energies  @xcite , these contributions turned out to be dominant everywhere  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the multi - step breakup effects were also found to be quite important at these energies @xcite    recently , the coulomb dissociation of @xmath0b on a @xmath1pb target has been performed at gsi - darmstadt at the beam energy of 250 mev / nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the cd process at this high energy are : ( i ) measurements at @xmath12 lower than riken are possible due to certain experimental advantages  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the multi - step breakup processes ( @xmath18 the coulomb post - acceleration ) are negligible  @xcite , and ( iii ) the nuclear breakup processes are expected to be negligible in comparison to the coulomb one due to the strong enhancement in the virtual photon spectrum  @xcite , an advantage that existed already in the experiments performed at the riken energies in the kinematical regime as mentioned above  @xcite . at the beam energy of 250 mev / nucleon , the @xmath5 component is expected to be about one third of that found at riken energies although , at the same time , the @xmath19 component is also reduced by about one half .",
    "but more importantly , the @xmath4 component is expected to be enhanced particularly in the first resonance region ( 0.5 mev @xmath15 @xmath12 @xmath15 0.65 mev ) .",
    "this provides an alternative opportunity to test various models of the @xmath0b structure , as they differ in their treatment of the resonance structure of this nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform calculations of the cd of @xmath0b on @xmath1pb target at the beam energy of 250 mev / nucleon , using the cross section for the cature reaction @xmath2be(p,@xmath3)@xmath0b calculated within a recently developed realistic shell model which includes coupling between many particle quasi - bound states and the continuum of one particle scattering states ( to be referred as the shell model embedded into the continuum ( smec ) approach ) @xcite . in order to investigate the sensitivity of the cd process to the structure of @xmath0b",
    ", we also perform calculations within a single particle potential model using the parameters ginen by esbensen and bertsch ( eb )  @xcite .",
    "we compare the results of our calculations with the preminary data on the angle integrated cross sections for this reaction taken recently in an experiment performed at the gsi , darmstadt  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the kinematical regime where the breakup measurements performed at these energies can be reliably used to extract the astrophysical @xmath20-factor ( @xmath21 ) for the @xmath2be(@xmath14b capture reaction .",

    "this can be traced back to the differences in predictions of the two models for the direct capture cross sections of various multipolarities ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we note that while the @xmath19 cross sections obtained with smec ( version iii ) and eb model are similar , the two differ in case of smec version iv .",
    "on the other hand , smec e2 cross sections are always larger than that of the eb potential model . at the same time , the @xmath4 cross section of the latter are much larger and wider in width as compared to that of former .    therefore , the coulomb dissociation data at these high energies seem to show sensitivity to the capture cross sections calculated within different models of @xmath0b structure .",
    "although these are only preliminary data , yet smec models appear to be in a somewhat better agreement with it . unfortunately , it is difficult to commment on the the difference seen in the widths of the @xmath4 resonance in the two models .",
    "this is because the experiments have a finite resolution ( @xmath10 110 kev at @xmath12 = 0.63 mev  @xcite ) that may give a large aparent width to the cross sections near the resonance region .",

    "it would , be worthwhile to improve upon both these aspects in the future studies .",
    "however , it must be added here that the width of this resonance is tested basically with the direct radiative capture @xmath175data .",
    "we next investigate the role of the @xmath4 multipolarity in the high energy data of gsi .",
    "we would like to recall that at lower beam energies ( _ e.g. _ , the riken experiments  @xcite ) , the contribution of this multipolarity was almost negligible . in fig .",
    "4 , we show the cd predictions ( obtained with smec , version iii ) for @xmath19 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 components of the angular distributions for the @xmath0b + @xmath1pb @xmath167 @xmath0b@xmath160 + @xmath1pb reaction at the beam energies of 51.9 mev / nucleon . for completeness",
    "sake we also show the experimental data of kikuchi et al .  @xcite .",
    "note that since these cd calculations have been done within a pure semi - classical theory  @xcite , the agreement with the data , beyond 4@xmath7 is not good as compared to that seen in ref .",
    "@xcite . as has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the point like projectile approximation of the semi - classical theory breaks down at angles beyond this .",
    "inclusion of finite - size effects of the projectile reduces the cross sections at larger angles which leads to a better agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "it may remarked here that although , the calculations reported in ref .  @xcite are done within a quantum mechanical theory , the point like projectile approximation is still made there .",
    "any how , the purpose of this figure is more to show the contribution of the @xmath4 multipolarity to the cd cross sections . as can be seen , the contribution of this multipolarity is negligible even in the energy bin 500 - 750 kev .",
    "on the other hand , one can see from fig .",
    "5 , where we show the cd calculations for only @xmath19 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath5 ( dotted lines ) multipolarities and their sum ( solid line ) for the same reaction as in fig .",
    "2 , that at 250 mev / nucleon , it is not possible to explain the data in the region of @xmath12 between 500 - 750 kev without the contribution of the @xmath4 multipolarity . in this figure",
    "the results obtained with versions iii ( a ) and iv ( b ) of smec are shown .",
    "the @xmath19 + @xmath5 cross sections in version iv are somewhat larger as the @xmath19 component in this case is bigger .",
    "this sensitivity of the higher energy breakup data to the @xmath4 multipolarity makes it possible to use this to supplement the information on the continuum structure of @xmath0b which was not feasible by similar studies at lower beam energies .    in fig .",
    "6 , we show the cd angular distributions ( @xmath176 in this figure corresponds to @xmath171 ) calculated with capture cross sections of smec versions iii and iv for the same reaction as in fig .",
    "these results have been obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ cdiss ] ) over @xmath12 between 0.1 mev to 3.0 mev .",
    "the contributions of @xmath19 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 multipolarities are shown by by dashed , dotted and dashed - dotted curves respectively .",
    "their sum is shown by the solid lines .",
    "we can see that @xmath5 and @xmath4 contributions start becoming important already from 1@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the requirement of the cd method that for a reliable extraction of the astrophysical @xmath20-factor the data should be dominated by the excitation of a single multipolarity ( @xmath19 in present case ) , is more likely to be fulfilled in the measurements at gsi energies if the angle @xmath171 is kept below 1@xmath7 .",
    "this point is further emphasized in fig .",
    "7 , where we show the energy distributions of the cd cross sections obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( 17 ) for @xmath171 up to 1.87 @xmath7 ( angular range of the data used in this paper ) ( part ( a ) ) , and that obtained by performing the integration up to 1@xmath7 only ( part ( b ) ) .",
    "the @xmath19 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 components are shown by dashed , dotted and dashed - dotted curves respectively , while their sum is shown by the solid curves .",
    "the cross sections are shown only up to @xmath12 of 0.5 mev , which is the region of interest for the determination of the @xmath20-factor .",
    "it can be seen from part ( a ) that if @xmath171 goes up to 1.87@xmath7 , the @xmath5 components are substantial ( up to about 25% ) even at @xmath12 below 0.25 mev . however , if @xmath171 is confined to angles below 1@xmath7 , the contributions of the @xmath5 component are almost an order of magnitude down in comparison to those of @xmath19 for @xmath12 below 0.30 mev .",
    "therefore , this provides a better possibility of a reliable extraction of @xmath21 .",
    "in this paper , we used the cross sections for the radiative capture reaction @xmath2be(p,@xmath3)@xmath0b , calculated within the shell model embedded into the continuum approach for the structure of @xmath0b , to study the coulomb dissociation of @xmath0b on a @xmath1pb target at the beam energy of 250 mev / nucleon .",
    "cross sections obtained with four versions of smec were used .",
    "calculations were also performed with the capture cross sections obtained in a single particle model using the potential parameters given by esbensen and bertsch  @xcite .",
    "comparison of the calculations were made with the preliminary data for this reaction taken at gsi , darmstadt recently .",
    "the cd cross sections at these high energy were found to be sensitive to the nuclear structure model of @xmath0b .",
    "in contrast to the cd data taken at lower beam energies , the @xmath4 multipolarity is quite important at higher beam energies .",
    "it may therefore , be possible to supplement the information on the continuum structure of @xmath0b from the cd studies at higher energies .",
    "as far as the preliminary data are concerned , the fits obtained with smec approach are somewhat better than those with the eb potential model . we noted that if the angles of the center - of - mass of the outgoing [ @xmath9 pair with respect to the beam direction were taken up to 1.87@xmath7 , the @xmath5 component is quite large even at [ @xmath9 cm energies below 0.25 mev . to minimize the contribution of the @xmath5 multipolarity",
    ", this angle should be confined to values below 1@xmath7 .",
    "this conclusion appears to be by and large independent of the nuclear structure model of @xmath0b .",
