    "the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) was invented more than forty years ago to describe dilute magnetic impurities in metals  @xcite . in recent years",
    "it has become a generic model for the physics of strong local electron interactions  @xcite and is currently attracting much interest as a model for studying quantum dots coupled to leads  @xcite .",
    "its importance has also grown with the advent of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite . within the dmft approach a lattice model such as the hubbard model in the limit of high dimensions",
    "is mapped onto an effective siam which is determined self - consistently .",
    "although the properties of the siam are generally well understood from numerous studies based on various methods , the situation is not fully satisfactory as far as the dynamic properties are concerned , especially the zero - temperature high - frequency dynamics .",
    "many - body theories , such as perturbation theory or the local moment approach ( lma )  @xcite , provide an explanative ( and often accurate ) picture of quantum impurity dynamics but their accuracy is not known _",
    "a priori_. quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations combined with the maximum entropy method  @xcite give accurate results at finite temperature but extrapolations of the dynamic properties to low - temperature are more difficult . the numerical renormalisation group ( nrg )  @xcite allows one to determine the low - energy dynamics of quantum impurity models almost exactly but this method is less precise at high - energy because of the necessary logarithmic discretisation of the host band .",
    "the nrg has been applied to various quantum impurity problems with great success but it has proven more difficult to apply nrg transformations to quantum lattice models .",
    "these difficulties provided the motivation for the development of the density - matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) a decade ago  @xcite .",
    "dmrg is one of the most powerful numerical techniques for studying quantum lattice many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "recently a dynamical dmrg ( ddmrg ) method has been developed to calculate dynamic correlation functions at zero temperature in quantum lattice models  @xcite .",
    "here we extend this approach to the calculation of the spectral properties in quantum impurity models .",
    "the method is demonstrated on the flat - band symmetric siam .",
    "we show that ddmrg can provide the spectral density of the siam for all frequencies and coupling strengths .",
    "in particular , the high - energy spectrum can be determined with a good resolution .",
    "thus the ddmrg approach is a very useful complement to existing techniques for calculating the dynamics of quantum impurity models .",
    "the hamiltonian of the siam is @xmath0 where @xmath1 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath2 in a local level ( the impurity site ) , @xmath3 and @xmath4 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath5 in an eigenstate of the ( non - interacting ) host band with dispersion @xmath6 .",
    "the sum over the index @xmath7 runs over all states of the host band .",
    "the hybridisation between the local impurity state and the delocalised band state @xmath7 is given by the positive couplings @xmath8 .",
    "electrons in the local level are subject to a coulomb repulsion @xmath9 .",
    "( the impurity site potential is set by @xmath10 as we will discuss the symmetric siam only . )",
    "the impurity one - particle green s function can be written ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ground state energy and @xmath14 represents a ground state expectation value . in most studies of quantum impurity problems",
    "an objective is the computation of the impurity spectral density @xmath15 with @xmath16 } \\hat{d}_{\\sigma } \\right   \\rangle \\label{ados}\\\\ b_{\\sigma}(\\omega \\geq 0 ) & = & \\lim_{\\eta \\rightarrow 0 } \\left \\langle \\hat{d}_{\\sigma }   \\frac{\\eta}{\\pi[(\\hat{h}-e_0-\\omega)^2+\\eta^2 ] }   \\hat{d}^{\\dag}_{\\sigma } \\right \\rangle   \\label{bdos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath17 .",
    "the spectral density fulfills the sum rule @xmath18    the impurity spectral density of the siam model depends on the parameter @xmath9 and the hybridisation function @xmath19 for a symmetric hybridisation function @xmath20 the siam has a particle - hole symmetry . as consequences",
    ", the green s function  ( [ green ] ) is an odd function of @xmath21 but the spectral density  ( [ dos ] ) is an even function , @xmath22 [ or @xmath23 $ ] , and the fermi energy remains pinned at @xmath24 for all @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , as the total spin is conserved in the siam , @xmath25 .",
    "in the rest of this paper we will explain how the spectral density of a quantum impurity problem such as the symmetric siam can be calculated with ddmrg .",
    "to illustrate the various approaches that we have tested we show results for a well - known particular case of the siam : the flat - band model  @xcite . in that case",
    ", the host band width is taken to be much larger than any other energy scales and the hybridisation function is assumed to be constant on these scales , @xmath26 .",
    "our goal is then to compute @xmath27 in the relevant energy window @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "it should be noted that a friedel sum rule @xmath30 holds at the fermi energy @xmath24 for all @xmath31 in the flat - band symmetric siam . in all numerical results presented here",
    "the energy scale is set by @xmath32 .",
    "since the invention of dmrg there have been numerous applications of this method to systems made of one or more impurities coupled to ( generally interacting ) one - dimensional hosts  @xcite .",
    "recently the growing interest for quantum impurity problems has spurred the development of dmrg techniques for investigating the more relevant problems of impurities coupled to arbitrary non - interacting host bands both in the context of quantum dots  @xcite and of dmft calculations  @xcite .",
    "a direct application of the usual dmrg algorithms to the siam hamiltonian  ( [ siam ] ) is possible but extremely inefficient because it includes `` long - range '' hopping terms ( more precisely , an electron can go from one site to any other site in just two hops ) .",
    "a better approach is the transformation of the hamiltonian  ( [ siam ] ) into a linear chain with nearest - neighbor interactions only ( as in a nrg calculation  @xcite ) @xmath33 the new fermion operators @xmath34 corresponds to electronic states in the host band and are related to the original representation by a canonical transformation @xmath35 the orthogonal matrix @xmath36 , the diagonal terms @xmath37 and the nearest - neighbor hopping terms @xmath38 are calculated with the lanczos iterative algorithm for tridiagonalising a symmetric matrix starting from the initial vector \\{@xmath39 } with @xmath40 .",
    "this calculation must be carried out with very high numerical accuracy ( quadruple or higher precision for floating - point operations ) but does not present any other difficulty .",
    "if the original hamiltonian  ( [ siam ] ) is particle - hole symmetric , the diagonal terms @xmath37 vanish .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ siam2 ] ) describes an impurity coupled to one end of a one - dimensional chain representing the host band states ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) . here",
    "we will use only this configuration .",
    "however , one can easily imagine different configurations such as an impurity site located between two chains as also shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "in that case , the left and right chains could correspond to band states below ( @xmath41 ) and above ( @xmath42 ) the fermi energy , respectively .",
    "another possibility is that the left and right chains could correspond to up - spin and down - spin band states , respectively .",
    "the transformation  ( [ transformation ] ) described above can easily be adapted for either cases .",
    "it can also be generalised to more complicated impurity problems with more than one local level or more than one host band .",
    "the finite - system dmrg algorithm  @xcite can be used to calculate ground state properties of the hamiltonian  ( [ siam2 ] ) . in particular",
    ", the ground state wavefunction @xmath43 and the ground state energy @xmath13 can readily be obtained .",
    "to compute dynamic properties such as the impurity green s function  ( [ green ] ) we use the dynamical dmrg  @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on a variational principle .",
    "one can easily show that for @xmath44 and a fixed frequency @xmath21 the minimum of the functional @xmath45 with respect to all quantum states @xmath46 is @xmath47 the functional minimum is related to the convolution of the spectral density  ( [ bdos ] ) with a lorentz distribution of width @xmath48 by @xmath49 a similar result is obtained for the spectral density  ( [ ados ] ) if one substitutes @xmath50 for @xmath51 , @xmath52 for @xmath21 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 in the above equations .",
    "the ddmrg method consists essentially in minimising the functional  ( [ functional ] ) numerically using the finite - system dmrg algorithm .",
    "thus ddmrg provides the spectral densities @xmath55 and @xmath56 for a finite broadening @xmath48 .",
    "the full spectral density  ( [ dos ] ) convolved with the lorentz distribution @xmath57 } \\label{convolution}\\ ] ] is given by the sum of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the real part of the green s function can be calculated with no additional computational cost but is generally less accurate .",
    "the necessary broadening of spectral functions in ddmrg calculations is actually very useful for studying continuous spectra or doing a finite - size scaling analysis  @xcite .",
    "the objective of our dmrg simulations is to obtain physical quantities with a sufficient accuracy at the lowest possible computational cost . for this purpose ,",
    "the lattice configuration used in the present work makes necessary an adaptation of the usual dmrg principles for measurements . in standard dmrg calculations the one - dimensional lattice is split in two blocks of sites separated by two intermediate sites  @xcite .",
    "calculations are carried out in an effective hilbert space of dimension @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the number of states per site ( @xmath60 counting the spin degeneracy in our case ) and @xmath61 are the numbers of states used to describe the left and right blocks , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the maximum number of density - matrix eigenstates kept and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the numbers of sites in the left and right blocks , respectively .",
    "the dmrg method errors diminish ( often exponentially fast ) as @xmath63 is increased while the computational cost increases as @xmath66 ( at least in theory ) . during a dmrg simulation the position where the chain is split is moved repeatedly through all sites and the measurement precision for a fixed number @xmath63 varies with that position .",
    "measurements of local quantities such as the density @xmath67 are most accurate if the site @xmath68 is one of the two intermediate sites .",
    "measurements of global quantities , such as the ground state energy or long - range correlations , are most accurate if the chain is split in two blocks of equal size because the effective hilbert space dimension @xmath69 is maximal then . in the present application",
    "we have found that it is necessary to compromise in order to optimize the ratio between accuracy and computational cost in calculations of the spectral density for an impurity located at a chain end .",
    "measurements have to be done as close as possible to the impurity but far enough from the chain end for the effective hilbert space to approach its maximal dimension @xmath70 .",
    "this implies that measurements are to be done when the left block has reached the size of @xmath71 sites ( assuming the impurity to be at the left chain end ) .    in practice ,",
    "we keep enough density - matrix eigenstates to make ( d)dmrg truncation errors negligible ( we have used up to @xmath72 states in the present work ) .",
    "thus our ddmrg results for finite systems are numerically exact in the same sense as  exact diagonalisation \" results are .",
    "the main source of errors are finite - size effects , which corresponds to the discretisation of the continuous host band in the siam and are discussed in the next section .    in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the spectral density of the flat - band symmetric siam calculated with ddmrg for @xmath73 .",
    "the exact spectral density is a lorentzian of width @xmath74 . with the broadening  ( [ convolution ] )",
    "it becomes @xmath75 } .",
    "\\label{lorentzian}\\ ] ] on the scale of figure  [ fig2 ] there is no visible difference between our numerical results and this exact result , which demonstrates the accuracy of our method .",
    "note that the @xmath73 limit is a relevant accuracy test .",
    "the hybridisation @xmath76 with the host band is renormalised in the density - matrix renormalisation and thus our method could become exceptionally accurate for some specific hybridisations [ for instance , @xmath77 but the local coulomb interaction @xmath9 is always treated exactly and thus does not affect the method accuracy directly .    with ddmrg",
    "the computational cost ( memory and processor time ) of computing @xmath78 for a single frequency @xmath21 is proportional to the number @xmath79 of sites in the system . in practice",
    ", the total processor time for calculating the full spectrum grows as @xmath80 because one usually reduces @xmath48 and increases the frequency resolution as @xmath79 is increased .",
    "we are interested in the properties of the siam with a continuous host band and a continuous hybridisation function @xmath76 but dmrg calculations can be performed on finite lattices only .",
    "therefore , we must discretise the host band and carry out dmrg calculations for a finite number @xmath79 of host band eigenstates corresponding to energies @xmath81 , then extrapolate the results to a continuous host band ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "choosing an appropriate discretisation of the host band ( i.e. , selecting the @xmath79 band state energies @xmath83 ) turns out to be the greatest difficulty in applying ddmrg to the siam .    the spectral density  ( [ ados ] ) [ or similarly  ( [ bdos ] ) ] can be written in the lehmann representation @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , design the eigenstates of @xmath87 contributing to @xmath88 ( i.e. , with non - vanishing matrix elements ) and @xmath89 their respective energies . on a finite lattice",
    "this spectrum is always discrete . to determine the exact siam spectral density for @xmath90 it is necessary to use a broadening @xmath48 larger than the space @xmath91 between two consecutive eigenstates in dense parts of the spectrum ( for instance , in continuous parts of the spectrum )  @xcite . in the flat - band siam ( and also in self - consistent siam",
    "derived in dmft calculations for the hubbard model  @xcite ) the distribution of excited states contributing to the spectral density for finite @xmath79 is essentially determined by the distribution of selected energies @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , we must use @xmath92 in other words , the host band discretisation directly limits the resolution of spectral density calculations .",
    "note that this is a general difficulty for all methods based on a discretisation of the siam , not only for ddmrg calculations .",
    "for instance , a similar problem limits the resolution of nrg calculations at high energy .    in practice , we choose @xmath79 values @xmath83 in the relevant energy window @xmath93 and calculate the corresponding hybridisation terms @xmath94 where @xmath95 . if @xmath76 varies slowly for @xmath96 on the scale @xmath97 then @xmath98 .",
    "for the flat - band siam that we are considering here this last equation is obviously exact . to preserve the particle - hole symmetry in the discrete siam",
    "we only include pairs of band states with opposite energies in the @xmath79 selected values .",
    "for even @xmath79 this means that there are @xmath99 different pairs ( @xmath100 ) , while for odd @xmath79 there are @xmath101 such pairs and a state at @xmath102 .",
    "including the impurity site , the total number of sites in the lattice is thus @xmath103 .",
    "the ground state contains an equal number of electrons and has a minimal total spin @xmath104 for odd @xmath79 and @xmath105 for even @xmath79 .",
    "note that in that last case ( @xmath106 ) we need to compute the spectral density for both @xmath107 and @xmath108 and take the average , as the spin - flip symmetry @xmath109 is broken .",
    "it is thus more efficient to work with an odd number @xmath79 of host band states .",
    "the simplest discretisation scheme consists in choosing @xmath79 equidistant energies @xmath83 ( @xmath110 ) in the relevant energy window ( @xmath111 ) . in that case",
    "we use a constant broadening @xmath112 .",
    "this approach has been used for the @xmath73 results shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "a constant discretisation is sufficient provided that the spectrum does not contain any structure with a width smaller than @xmath113 , which is readily achieved in the weak - coupling siam .",
    "it is well - known  @xcite that for intermediate to strong couplings @xmath9 the broad spectral feature around @xmath114 shrinks to a sharp peak ( the so - called abrikosov - suhl resonance ) .",
    "the spectral weight is progressively transfered to two hubbard satellites around @xmath115 for increasing @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , in figure  [ fig3 ] we show the spectral density for the intermediate coupling @xmath116 calculated with a constant discretisation @xmath117 and a broadening @xmath118 .",
    "this spectrum agrees qualitatively with lma and nrg results  @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , however , the ddmrg spectrum is obviously inaccurate , especially around @xmath119 .",
    "for instance , at the fermi level the friedel sum rule  ( [ friedel ] ) is clearly not fulfilled . as for the @xmath73 case",
    "this apparent discrepancy is due to the broadening @xmath48 .    to obtain better results one can perform calculations with a higher resolution ( which means smaller @xmath120 and thus larger lattice size @xmath79 ) and possibly extrapolate to the limits @xmath121 and @xmath82 . in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we show @xmath122 calculated with ddmrg at @xmath123 for several values of @xmath48 .",
    "for comparison we also show the exact scaling for the non - interacting ( @xmath73 ) case . clearly , @xmath122 tends to the exact result as @xmath121 but the convergence is slow and will become worse for sharper resonances ( larger @xmath9 ) .",
    "for instance , for @xmath124 we can already clearly observe a very sharp abrikosov - suhl resonance using a resolution of @xmath125 but the height of the peak is only @xmath126 .",
    "actually , one can guess that a broadening @xmath48 smaller than the kondo scale @xmath127  @xcite is required to obtain the low - energy spectral density with a good resolution and accuracy",
    ". therefore , the required system size @xmath128 increases exponentially with @xmath9 if one uses a constant discretisation .",
    "this approach is clearly not practicable .    as an interest of many quantum impurity problems",
    "is the investigation of sharp resonances in the spectral density and a analogous sharp quasi - particle peak is an essential feature of dmft calculations , it is desirable to achieve a high accuracy and resolution for these spectral features too .",
    "a better approach is the use of a variable discretisation .",
    "for instance , one can select two sets of equidistant energies @xmath83 in the host band with a energy resolution @xmath129 for high energies @xmath130 and with another energy resolution @xmath131 for @xmath132 ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) . in that case",
    "the broadening @xmath48 also depends on @xmath21 .",
    "typically , we use @xmath112 for @xmath133 and @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "this allows us to obtain the spectral density around the abrikosov - suhl resonance with a much higher resolution for a given number of host band sites @xmath79 .",
    "it is also possible to use more than two different energy resolutions , to use a higher energy resolution for the high energy sector than for the low energy sector , or even to select a higher resolution at intermediate energies ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is possible to combine the results of the high - resolution sectors obtained with different variable discretisations in a single high resolution spectrum .",
    "this approach allows us to achieve a resolution which is significantly better than with the constant discretisation for the same number of host band states @xmath79 .",
    "for instance , figure  [ fig3 ] shows the spectral density obtained with variable discretisation @xmath129 and broadening @xmath48 ranging from @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) for the hubbard satellites to @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) for @xmath140 .",
    "this approach clearly gives much better results for the sharp abrikosov - suhl resonance than the constant discretisation approach .",
    "the friedel sum rule  ( [ friedel ] ) at the fermi level is fulfilled within 3 % .",
    "it should be noted that this approach is not without problem .",
    "the most obvious drawback is that a variable broadening @xmath141 breaks the sum rule  ( [ sumrule ] ) and can significantly change the spectrum shape if it varies faster than the bare spectrum as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "( this could be the case for the abrikosov - suhl resonance shown as a solid line in the inset of figure 3 . )    to take advantage of the higher resolution provided by a variable discretisation while keeping the benefit of a constant broadening @xmath48 we have devise the following scheme .",
    "the relevant energy window is split into several intervals . for each interval",
    ", a ddmrg calculation is done using a variable discretisation with a high resolution in that interval and a lower resolution outside .",
    "the spectral function is calculated for frequencies in that interval .",
    "then the results obtained in each calculation are combined into a full spectrum .",
    "the computational effort is equal to that of a single calculation with a constant discretisation for the same number of host band states , but the resolution is higher . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the spectral density calculated using this scheme with a high resolution of @xmath142 inside each interval and a lower resolution of @xmath143 outside .",
    "the spectrum has been calculated with @xmath144 then deconvolved ( see next section ) .",
    "this spectrum is clearly sharper than the one obtained with a constant discretisation and , by comparison with related nrg and lma results , it seems also more accurate .",
    "the improvement is due both to the lower broadening @xmath48 and the deconvolution . nevertheless , the variable discretisation scheme with varying broadening @xmath48 is more accurate for low frequency and gives a much sharper abrikosov - suhl resonance .    as in nrg calculations  @xcite a logarithmic discretisation of the host band @xmath145 ( with @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) is possible .",
    "ground state dmrg calculations can easily been performed although the computational effort is significantly greater than with nrg .",
    "calculating the spectral density with ddmrg is more problematic .",
    "the main problem is that we have not found any satisfactory method to broaden the spectrum . in nrg calculations",
    "@xcite the spectrum is convolved with a function which vanishes for @xmath140 and broadens the spectrum on a logarithmic scale @xmath148 . in ddmrg calculations",
    "we always get the spectrum convolved with a lorentzian  ( [ convolution ] ) . to imitate the logarithmic broadening",
    "we have tried a `` lorentzian '' broadening  ( [ convolution ] ) with a variable @xmath149 .",
    "note that with the ddmrg method we can change @xmath48 as a function of @xmath21 but not of @xmath150 in  ( [ convolution ] ) .",
    "fortunately , if @xmath151 is the impurity green s function obtained with ddmrg for @xmath152 , the desired green s function @xmath153 with @xmath154 can be obtained through @xmath155 note that the condition  ( [ broadening ] ) implies @xmath156 .",
    "we have tested this approach on the flat - band siam for various values of @xmath9 . as expected , the high - energy spectrum is widely broadened and qualitatively similar to corresponding nrg results  @xcite . in the low - energy spectrum , however , this scheme clearly does not work because @xmath27 seems to diverge for @xmath140 or at least the fermi level spectral density @xmath157 is much larger than the exact value @xmath158 .",
    "we think that this failure is due to the broadening with the lorentzian function  ( [ convolution ] ) , which does not vanish for @xmath159 contrary to the function used in nrg calculations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a logarithmic discretisation does not seem to be useful for ddmrg calculations . it should be noted that with the lanczos - dmrg  @xcite or the correction - vector dmrg  @xcite it should be possible to calculate the spectral density in the lehmann representation  ( [ lehmann ] ) ( i.e. , without broadening ) and to broaden it on a logarithmic scale as in nrg calculations .",
    "this approach could give better results for the low - energy spectrum than the ddmrg approach discussed here but has yet to be tested .    in summary ,",
    "the host band discretisation determines the resolution of ddmrg calculations for the impurity spectral density .",
    "no single discretisation scheme is appropriate for all cases .",
    "nevertheless , a combination of different schemes can be used for the various features of the same spectrum .",
    "therefore , ddmrg allows one to calculate a spectral density with high resolution for all frequencies provided the host band discretisation and the broadening are adapted to the specific problem and its spectral features .",
    "an approach for obtaining sharper spectra is the deconvolution of the ddmrg data . in theory , a deconvolution means solving ( [ convolution ] ) for @xmath160 using the ddmrg data in the left - hand side .",
    "however , this is typically a ill - conditioned inversion problem  @xcite which generally can not be solved numerically .",
    "moreover , if it was possible to do this calculation exactly , one would obtain the discrete spectral density of the siam on a finite lattice of @xmath103 sites .    nevertheless , the broadened spectral density of the siam on a infinite lattice ( @xmath82 ) is usually almost identical to the spectral density of the discretised siam ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "for instance , for @xmath73 there is no visible difference in figure  [ fig2 ] between the ddmrg results for @xmath162 and the exact result for @xmath90 .",
    "[ a necessary condition for a large enough @xmath48 is ( [ broadening ] ) . ]",
    "therefore , one can make the approximation that ddmrg data for @xmath78 describe the broadened spectral density for @xmath82 and solve ( [ convolution ] ) approximately under the condition that @xmath27 is the exact spectral density of the siam .",
    "for instance , one can require that @xmath27 is a continuous and relatively smooth function .    in practice , we calculate @xmath27 using the algorithm presented in  @xcite or using standard linear regularisation methods for the inverse problem  @xcite .",
    "other possibilities include using fourier transformations  @xcite or the maximum entropy method as in qmc simulations  @xcite . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "one sees that the deconvolved ddmrg spectral density agrees perfectly with the exact result for @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , a deconvolution gives excellent results for finite but weak coupling @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath116 the deconvolved spectral density in figure  [ fig3 ] shows sharper abrikosov - suhl resonance and hubbard satellites than the original ddmrg data for @xmath163 ( not shown ) .",
    "however , the friedel sum rule  ( [ friedel ] ) at the fermi level is far from being fulfilled ( the relative error is about 10 % ) , which indicates that the fermi level resonance is still too broad despite the deconvolution . in general",
    ", we have found that the deconvolution works very well for the hubbard satellites and other broad structures ( broader than @xmath48 ) but bring only a partial improvement for sharp peaks .",
    "deconvolution methods become rapidly instable if a variable broadening @xmath48 is used in ( [ convolution ] ) .",
    "therefore , we apply them to spectra calculated with a constant @xmath48 only . nevertheless , if the spectrum is made of well separated structures ( as the abrikosov - suhl peak and the hubbard satellites are for strong coupling @xmath164 ) , it is possible to deconvolve each structure separately . in that case",
    "we can use a different @xmath48 for each structure . in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    "we show the upper hubbard satellite calculated with ddmrg for @xmath124 then deconvolved .",
    "our numerical result agrees remarkably well with the lma prediction for this spectral structure in the strong coupling regime @xmath164 : a lorentz distribution of width @xmath165 and total weight @xmath166 centered at @xmath167 .",
    "note that in figure  [ fig6 ] we have chosen @xmath168 to fit our data rather than the value @xmath169 .",
    "this shift of @xmath170 is due to corrections to @xmath171 of the order of @xmath172 @xcite and the finite discretisation @xmath173 used in our calculation .",
    "the deconvolved ddmrg spectral density appears to contain more spectral weight than the lma result because we have used a rather narrow energy window @xmath174 in the ddmrg calculation and thus the spectral weight which normally lies in the high energy tail ( @xmath175 ) of the lorentz distribution has been shifted to low energy ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "we have extended the ddmrg method  @xcite to the investigation of dynamic properties in quantum impurity problems .",
    "the method has been demonstrated on the flat - band symmetric siam .",
    "we have obtained accurate results for the impurity spectral density for all frequencies and coupling strengths .",
    "the main difficulty of this approach is the choice of an appropriate discretisation of the host band to resolve sharp spectral features such as the abrikosov - suhl resonance in the strong - coupling regime of the siam .",
    "our method can readily be used to study quantum lattice many - body systems in the framework of the dmft .",
    "we have already applied this ddmrg - dmft technique to the hubbard model in infinite dimensions . for the metallic phase at weak coupling",
    "@xmath9 our numerical results have a better resolution than those obtained with nrg and are in excellent agreement with weak - coupling perturbation theory  @xcite . in the mott insulating phase",
    "ddmrg - dmft calculations are relatively easy to perform because there is no sharp structure to resolve around @xmath176 .",
    "thus we can obtain very accurate results for the hubbard bands in the spectral density and determined the one - particle gap .",
    "our numerical results agree remarkably well with strong - coupling perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "we are currently investigating the intermediate - coupling regime , where the mott metal - insulator transition occurs  @xcite , using ddmrg - dmft .    the ddmrg method presented here",
    "can be generalised and applied to a great variety of quantum impurity problems .",
    "first , although we have discussed only the symmetric flat - band siam , our method can readily be applied to an asymmetric siam  @xcite or more complicated hybridisation functions .",
    "second , the method can be used for other hamiltonians than the siam ( for instance , the kondo model ) provided that the transformation to a one - dimensional lattice configuration with short - range interactions only is possible .",
    "third , contrary to nrg our method can resolve sharp spectral structures at any frequency and thus could be very useful for studying the dynamics of systems with resonances at finite frequency , such as the kondo model in magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "fourth , ddmrg can be applied to models with other degrees of freedom than fermions .",
    "for instance , there are very efficient density - matrix renormalisation methods to treat bosons  @xcite",
    ". one can easily combine them with ddmrg to investigate a quantum degree of freedom coupled to a dissipative environment such as a phonon bath  @xcite .",
    "finally , our method can be generalised to problems with more than one impurity or more than one host band .",
    "if the impurity sites are arranged in a one - dimensional lattice and the number of host bands do not exceed two , the computational effort is probably comparable to that required for the investigation of the siam presented here .",
    "therefore , one should be able to investigate the dynamics of a two - channel kondo problem or of quantum dots and wires coupled to ( up to ) two leads  @xcite without difficulty .",
    "if the impurity sites form other structures such as a two - dimensional cluster or the number of host bands is greater than two ( which occurs for multi - channel kondo problems or in the dynamical cluster approximation  @xcite ) , ddmrg calculations of dynamic properties are also possible but the computational effort could be substantially greater . in summary , ddmrg provides a powerful and versatile approach for investigating the dynamics of quantum impurity problems .",
    "we are deeply grateful to f gebhard for suggesting the extension of ddmrg to quantum impurity problems and for many stimulating discussions .",
    "we also wish to thank t pruschke , d logan , t costi and r bulla for helpful discussions regarding the present work ."
