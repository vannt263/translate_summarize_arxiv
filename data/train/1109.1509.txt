    "the order parameter ( op in the following ) is the most important quantity in a superconductor , since it determines how the charge carriers couple to form cooper pairs . in the standard bcs theory for superconductivity @xcite ,",
    "the pairing potential is always attractive , does not depend on energy , is isotropic in space and is due to the interaction between electrons and phonons ( in other words , phonons are the `` mediating boson '' ) .",
    "the amplitude of the op , @xmath0 , is also the `` energy gap '' in the superconductor , i.e. the distance , in energy , between the condensate of cooper pairs and the first single - particle excitation .",
    "a dependence on energy of the op must be added , as in the so - called eliashberg theory @xcite , to properly describe those superconductors , like pb , where the interaction between electrons and phonons is particularly strong . in the past decades",
    ", many superconductors have been discovered in which the op is anisotropic ( i.e. its amplitude shows some angular dependence ) or can even change sign to become _ negative _ in some directions ( as in the so - called @xmath1-wave symmetry , common in copper - oxide superconductors ) ; in some cases , like the well - known mgb@xmath2 , multiple ops exist , related to different sets of bands that form separated `` sheets '' of the fermi surface .    the recently discovered fe - based superconductors present most of these unusual properties at the same time .",
    "the coupling of electrons with the mediating boson ( whatever its nature is ) seems to be intermediate to strong ; the fermi surface ( fs ) is made up of separated sheets , which are mostly 2d - like ; there are probably multiple ops that , in most cases , are expected to be isotropic but with opposite sign on hole - like and electron - like fs sheets @xcite . in some conditions , ops that display a sign change on the same sheet of the fs",
    "are predicted to become energetically favorable @xcite .",
    "as usual when a new class of superconductors is discovered , the experimental study of the op in fe - based superconductors has immediately attracted the attention and expectations of the scientific community . determining the number ,",
    "the amplitude and the symmetry of the ops is a necessary step to assess the coupling mechanism and to understand the details of _ how _ superconductivity occurs in these materials .",
    "point - contact spectroscopy is one of the techniques that have been more useful in the investigation of the op in these materials . despite its apparent simplicity ( it just consists in measuring the differential conductance of a very small , in principle point - like contact between a normal metal and the superconductor under study )",
    "it is a powerful and versatile , yet inexpensive , research tool generally based on a combination of quantum effects : the _ tunnel effect _ ( dominant in high - resistance contacts ) and the _ andreev reflection _ ( dominant in small - resistance contacts ) . here",
    "we will concentrate on the latter . to explain in a simple way what andreev reflection is ,",
    "let s imagine an incident electron with total energy @xmath3 to travel towards the interface in the @xmath4 ( normal ) side of a ideal , barrierless @xmath5 junction ( @xmath6 superconductor ) .",
    "if it finds vacant electronic states at the same energy on the @xmath7 side , the electron will simply propagate in @xmath7 .",
    "if instead its energy is smaller than the energy gap @xmath0 in @xmath7 , it can not propagate in @xmath7 , so it forms a cooper pair with another electron excited from the fermi sea in @xmath7 .",
    "this leaves a hole in @xmath7 that crosses the interface and travels backwards in @xmath4 ( see @xcite for more accurate descriptions ) . from the point of view of @xmath4",
    ", things happen as if the electron was reflected as a hole .",
    "this `` reflection '' causes a doubling of the conductance with respect to a @xmath8 junction in which andreev reflection can not take place .",
    "this doubling occurs only as long as the energy of the injected electron ( equal to @xmath9 if @xmath10 is the voltage difference between @xmath4 and @xmath7 ) is smaller or equal to @xmath0 . thus , a measurement of the junction conductance as a function of @xmath10 allows determining the gap , i.e. the amplitude of the op . in unconventional superconductors ,",
    "the shape of the conductance curves can provide information not only on the amplitude of the op , but also on its angular dependence ( i.e. symmetry in reciprocal space ) and , in particular conditions , on the shape of the fermi surface and on the spectral function of the boson that mediates the superconducting pairing , as we will discuss in section [ subsect : fs ] .",
    "point - contact andreev - reflection ( pcar ) spectroscopy measurements in fe - based superconductors have been carried out by various groups .",
    "early measurements suffered from the unsatisfactory quality of the first samples and gave indeed contradicting and sometimes unreproducible results .",
    "this might have given the impression that pcar does provide reliable results in these compounds .",
    "we will show in section [ sect : pcar ] that , instead , when pcar experiments in good - quality samples are carried out with all the necessary cautions by different groups and even in samples of different forms ( single crystals , polycrystals , films ) they do provide surprisingly consistent results .",
    "the sometimes contradicting conclusions arise from the interpretation of the data rather than from the data themselves .",
    "we will thus show that , in the most studied 1111 and 122 compounds , the available pcar results agree rather well on the amplitude of the ops , on their temperature dependence and on their symmetry ( the @xmath11 one , with isotropic ops with sign reversal between holelike and electronlike fs sheets being the most likely , at least at optimal doping ) . in the same section we will also present and discuss recent pcar results in the 122 and 22426 families that seem to indicate a nodal , or strongly anisotropic op .",
    "if confirmed , these findings can serve as a test for the theories that predict the occurrence of anisotropic and nodal symmetries in suitable conditions , related to fine details of the lattice structure .",
    "the problem of extracting the electron - boson spectrum from pcar measurements in these materials will be dealt with in section [ sect : ebiinfebased ] .",
    "we will show that , with the combined use of eliashberg theory and of the models for pcar conductance , it is possible to extract the characteristic energy of the mediating boson and also to pose some constraints on the shape of the relevant spectrum .",
    "the strong electron - boson coupling also explains some anomalies in the pcar conductance curves , namely the excess conductance at high energy , that greatly complicates the normalization of the conductance curves and sometimes prevents a good fit of the curves with models based on constant , bcs - like ops .    finally , in section [ sect : puzzle ] , we will show that the values of the gap ratios @xmath12 collected from pcar measurements in various fe - based superconductors seem to follow a universal trend as a function of the critical temperature ( @xmath13 ) of the samples .",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath15 remain approximately constant down to @xmath16 k , then tend to _ increase _ in compounds with lower @xmath13  even though further measurements in the low-@xmath13 region would be necessary to confirm this trend .",
    "we will propose a possible explanation of this behavior that essentially relies on the fact that the mediating boson is an electronic excitation ( for example , spin fluctuations ) and thus is subject to a `` feedback effect '' of the condensate on the electron - boson spectral function .",
    "we already presented in a recent review @xcite the explicit expressions for the normalized conductance of a point contact between a normal metal ( @xmath4 ) and a superconductor ( @xmath7 ) in the case of a 2d geometry of the fermi surfaces of the latter .",
    "let us briefly summarize these equations here , since in subsection [ subsect : fs ] we will use them as the starting point to extend the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) model to particular 3d shapes of the fs and to particular directions of current injection . in the following we will call `` 2d btk model '' the generalization of the original , `` 1d '' btk theory @xcite , introduced in 1996 by y. tanaka and s. kashiwaya @xcite . in their article",
    "they first wrote the normalized conductance @xmath17 at @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the currents flowing through the interface when the material under study is in the superconducting and in the normal state , respectively ) as a function of the two quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 , whose real parts are the bcs quasiparticle and pair density of states , respectively .    here",
    "we will immediately generalize these expressions to the strong - coupling regime , where the order parameter @xmath0 is a complex function of energy resulting from the solution of the eliashberg equations , and to the presence of inelastic quasiparticle scattering processes at the n / s interface . in the latter case",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the resulting ( and dominant ) extrinsic reduction of the quasiparticle lifetime can be properly taken into account by including in the model an imaginary part of the energy described by the broadening parameter @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 as a consequence , from now on : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "note that we have allowed @xmath0 to depend on energy for the sake of generality , even though we will use this dependence explicitly only in section [ subsect : ebi ] .",
    "the main steps in the calculation of the normalized conductance @xmath27 consist in the determination of the barrier transparency when the material under study is in the normal state ( @xmath28 ) and in the superconducting state ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "these quantities are actually transmission probability distributions and are obtained by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations with the only condition that the component of the wavevector @xmath30 parallel to the interface is conserved in all processes , for any direction of the incoming electron from the n side . in the pure 2d case here discussed , where we suppose the interface to coincide with a plane parallel to the _ z _ axis , the incoming electrons lie in the _ xy _ plane and have a wave vector @xmath31 which forms an angle @xmath32 with respect to the unitary vector _",
    "@xmath33 _ normal to the interface . in principle , if the fermi velocity is different in the n and s side , the charge carriers experience a `` refraction '' when crossing the interface ( i.e. the wavevector of the quasiparticles in the s side of the junction @xmath34 could be different from @xmath31 ) so that the direction of propagation of quasiparticles in the s side could form an angle @xmath35 different from @xmath32 with respect to the normal to the interface . in these conditions ,",
    "electrons incident on the interface with suitable angles can experience a normal reflection even in absence of a barrier potential @xmath36 located at the interface , and the normal transmission coefficient @xmath28 is no longer identically 1 . in the most general case when @xmath36 is present , the normal transparency of the barrier is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the dimensionless parameter which accounts for the potential barrier .    from now on we will restrict the analysis to the case @xmath31=@xmath39 from which it follows @xmath32=@xmath35=@xmath40 . as a matter of fact , while properly taking into account the fermi velocity mismatch at the interface in the 2d case is a non - straightforward but feasible task ( see @xcite ) , it becomes an extremely complex problem in the full 3d case we will discuss in subsection [ subsect : fs ] , when the true shape of the fs will be considered . under the previous restrictive hypothesis",
    "the normal transparency becomes : @xmath41    it is clear that , for @xmath42 , the normal transmission probability is identically 1 for any direction of the incoming electron , i.e. for @xmath43 .",
    "when @xmath44 , instead , the barrier transparency depends on the direction of the incoming electron in the n side ; for @xmath45 ( tunneling regime ) the transmission probability is always small and highly directional .",
    "it can be shown that the relative transparency of the barrier in the superconducting state is given by @xcite : @xmath46\\gamma(e)^{2}|^{2 } } \\label{eq : sigma(e_theta)}\\ ] ] where @xmath47/n_{\\mathrm{p}}(e)$ ] and finally the normalized conductance at @xmath18 is : @xmath48    both at numerator and denominator of equation [ eq : g2d ] the integration extremes are @xmath49 and @xmath50 since the current injection occurs in the whole positive half - space for which @xmath51 .",
    "the standard btk theory @xcite is the 1d limit of this model , in which all the electrons from the n side are injected in the same direction perpendicular to the interface .",
    "obviously , the normal - state transmission probability in this case is simply obtained by putting @xmath52 in equation [ eq : taun ] , i.e. @xmath53 . by doing the same also in equations [ eq : sigma(e_theta ) ] and [ eq : g2d ] the expression for the 1d btk conductance @xmath54 is thus recovered .",
    "instead , the 2d btk model itself is the limit of the more general 3d model ( see section [ subsect : fs ] ) if the gap is isotropic and the fs is spherical ( i.e. the system has a rotational symmetry around the axis normal to the interface ) .     at @xmath18 and @xmath55 for different @xmath56 values from the pure andreev - reflection regime ( @xmath42 ) to the tunneling one ( @xmath45 ) .",

    "( b ) temperature dependency of the theoretical pcar normalized conductance of panel ( a ) for @xmath57 mev , @xmath55 and @xmath58 .",
    "also in this case solid curves represent the results of 1d btk model and dashed ones the results of 2d btk one . in the inset",
    "the bcs temperature dependency of the gap is shown .",
    "the curves in ( a ) and ( b ) are vertically offset for clarity.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    in figure [ fig:1d_2d](a ) a comparison of the normalized conductances @xmath59 ( solid lines ) and @xmath60 ( dashed lines ) is shown at @xmath18 and @xmath55 as a function of the normalized energy @xmath61 for different values of the barrier parameter @xmath56 .",
    "looking at the form of @xmath62 ( equation [ eq : taun ] ) , one expects the 1d btk normalized conductance to coincide with the 2d one in two opposite conditions : when @xmath42 ( i.e. when @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) and when @xmath65 ( i.e. when @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) .",
    "this is clearly shown in the curves at @xmath45 and @xmath42 .",
    "the maximum deviations between the predictions of the two models occur for @xmath68 which , incidentally , is the range of values commonly observed in experiments in fe - based superconductors .",
    "it is very easy to demonstrate that , in practice , each @xmath60 curve almost coincides with the @xmath69 calculated for a properly enhanced @xmath56 value and , thus , the 1d btk model can be efficiently used instead of the 2d one provided that the gap is isotropic , the fs spherical and one is not interested in the precise determination of the @xmath56 values .",
    "all the equations seen up to now are calculated at @xmath18 .",
    "the effect of a finite temperature @xmath70 can be properly taken into account by simply convolving the normalized conductance with the fermi function at that temperature , as shown in detail in @xcite and by including in the calculations the proper temperature dependence of the gap .",

    "this kind of curves is what is expected in the best pcar experiments ( @xmath55 ) on a single - band isotropic bcs superconductor .      in order to understand the profound changes occurring in the normalized conductance of a point contact when the symmetry of the order parameter is not _",
    "s _ wave , it is necessary to briefly describe in greater detail the physical processes that take place at the ns interface . when an electron coming from the n side reaches the potential barrier at the interface , four different processes can occur depending on the electron energy and on the height of the barrier : a )",
    "the electron is reflected as a hole in n ( andreev reflection ) ; b ) the electron is specularly reflected as an electron in n ( normal reflection ) ; c ) the electron is transmitted in s as an electron - like quasiparticle , elq ( normal transmission ) ; d ) the electron is transmitted in s as a hole - like quasiparticle , hlq ( anomalous transmission ) . due to the charge conservation this last process results in two electrons `` reflected '' back in n for every incoming electron .",
    "the probabilities of these processes strongly depend on the energy of the incoming electron and on the @xmath56 parameter .",
    "in particular , processes c and d are forbidden for @xmath74 ( where there can be no transmitted quasiparticles ) , process b is present at any energy when @xmath75 and process a is also present at any energy ( but is very small for @xmath76 ) only if @xmath56 values are not too large ( in practice @xmath77 ) .",
    "equation [ eq : g2d ] takes properly into account all these probabilities , but only in the case of an isotropic order parameter , i.e. in _ s_-wave symmetry . when the op is anisotropic , i.e. its amplitude and possibly its sign change as a function of the direction in reciprocal space , the situation is more complex . as a matter of fact , the wavevector of the elq @xmath78 and that of the hlq @xmath79 have now different direction , yet still having the same component parallel to the interface .",
    "in other words , the two vectors in the s side form the angles @xmath40 and @xmath80 with respect to the unitary vector @xmath33 , respectively @xcite .",
    "in this situation and depending on the orientation of the anisotropic op with respect to @xmath33 the elqs and the hlqs can feel different ops .",
    "let us extend the equations for the 2d btk model to this case .",
    "let us assume that the system has a translational invariance along @xmath81 , i.e. the fs is a cylinder , the op has a @xmath30 dependence only in the @xmath82 plane ( as it happens in cuprates ) and the current injection occurs in the same plane ( @xmath83-plane contact ) .",
    "we can now introduce the angle of misalignment @xmath84 between the crystallographic _ a _ axis in s and the normal to the interface @xmath33 . as a consequence of gap anisotropy and of this misalignment ,",
    "elqs feel the order parameter @xmath85 , while hlqs feel @xmath86 . in this case",
    "the relative transparency of the barrier in the superconducting state becomes @xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89\\ ] ] is the phase difference ( function of @xmath40 ) seen by the hlqs with respect to the elqs .",
    "of course , @xmath62 remains the same ( indeed it only describes processes b and c in a n - n junction ) and thus , simply by introducing the new expression for @xmath90 ( equation [ eq : sigma_anis ] ) into equation [ eq : g2d ] and performing the proper integration in @xmath40 one can obtain the normalized conductance at @xmath18 for any symmetry of the op in the @xmath82 plane .",
    "this symmetry is of course expressed by the specific @xmath40 dependence of the functions @xmath91 .",
    "+    in the present review we are interested in the symmetries that have been considered plausible for fe - based superconductor .",
    "the @xmath11 symmetry , with isotropic ops of different sign on the hole - like and on the electron - like fs sheets @xcite , is the most likely for the majority of the systems . if interband interference effects @xcite are negligible , this phase change is not detectable by pcar and gives the same spectra as a multiband @xmath92-wave symmetry . in suitable conditions , that seem to be related to fine structural parameters @xcite , anisotropic or nodal",
    "symmetries are expected to become more energetically favorable . as a consequence , apart from the _ s_-wave , we will discuss here the cases of _ fully anisotropic s - wave _ symmetry ( with zeros in the gap ) and @xmath93__-wave _ _ one .",
    "the two expressions for the op are : @xmath94 \\label{eq : s_anis}$ ] and @xmath95 respectively @xcite . in the first case",
    "the pair potential is zero in four directions but never changes sign , while in the second case the sign change typical of _ d_-wave symmetry is present , as shown in the insets of figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig:2](a ) reports the theoretical 2d ar normalized conductance curves obtained from the integration of equation [ eq : g2d ] for _ fully anisotropic s_-wave symmetry , at finite temperature ( @xmath96 k ) and different @xmath56 values .",
    "upper and lower panels refer to the cases @xmath55 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig:2](b ) and ( c ) report the corresponding conductance curves obtained for a @xmath1-wave symmetry , when @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively . without entering too much into details ,",
    "the main message coming from these calculations is the following . for current injection in the _ ab _ plane , and",
    "when @xmath56 is sufficiently small , a maximum of the conductance at zero bias appears both in _ anisotropic s_- and _ d_-wave symmetries ( top panels ) .",
    "these maxima however have a somehow different physical origin in the two symmetries . in _",
    "fully anisotropic s _ symmetry , they come only from the angular integration over ops that can assume any value between the maximum @xmath100 and 0 . in _",
    "d_-wave symmetry , the zero - bias maximum has the same origin only for @xmath42 , while for finite @xmath56 values it considerably grows ( becoming much higher than 2 in the tunneling regime ) because of an additional effect , i.e. the constructive interference of elqs and hlqs that feel a phase difference of the pair potential .",
    "this interference effect ( described by the @xmath101 term in the denominator of equation [ eq : sigma_anis ] ) is the only responsible for the zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) present in the _ d_-wave case for @xmath102 and large @xmath56 , a peak that is totally absent in the _ anisotropic s _ case .    in principle , the different shape of the conductance curves for the two symmetries at low @xmath56 shown in the upper panels of figure [ fig:2 ] would allow one to identify the true op symmetry . in practice , however , even a relatively small amount of broadening , i.e. @xmath103 , is sufficient to prevent the correct determination of the op symmetry , as shown in the lower panels of figure [ fig:2 ] , unless @xmath56 is sufficiently large . at low @xmath56 , the zbcp typical of the @xmath1-wave symmetry , smoothed by @xmath23 , can be confused with the zero - bias maximum of the _",
    "anisotropic s_-wave one .",
    "thus , in the presence of a zero - bias maximum in the experimental curves of _ ab_-plane point contacts in ar regime ( i.e at low @xmath56 ) what we can only say is that the op is zero along some directions . only _",
    "ab_-plane measurements in the _ tunneling _ regime would allow us to distinguish the two situations but , apparently , they are not so easy to obtain in fe - based compounds with point - contact or stm techniques .      in this subsection",
    "we will extend the 2d btk theory to arbitrary shapes of the fs and will show what is expected when the current is injected either in the @xmath83 plane or along the @xmath104 axis . under a few restrictive hypotheses ( still present in this approach ) , the final result will be the full 3d generalization of the btk model to any anisotropic feature both of the fs and of the pair potential symmetry .",
    "the first obvious generalization , essential for the interpretation of the results in fe - based superconductors , is to consider the multiband nature of superconductivity in these compounds and the multiple sheets of the fs arising from the crossings of the fermi energy by the different bands .",
    "this problem gained for the first time importance and popularity ten years ago with the discovery of @xmath105 , the first well - known multiband , multigap superconductor @xcite . at the level of ar data analysis and in order to have a limited number of fitting parameters the standard approach is to consider a two - band , two - gap system where the values of @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 of every band ( @xmath109 have to be determined by the best fit of theoretical curves to the experimental ones .",
    "the total normalized conductance is thus written as : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the normalized conductance of the i - th band ( 1d or 2d depending on the selected model ) and @xmath112 is the relative contribution of band 1 to the total conductance .",
    "the drawback here is that , apart from a few lucky cases @xcite , the weight factor @xmath112 is also a parameter of the fit .",
    "we will see later that this is not the case in the full 3d model where the weighting factors come automatically from the complex interaction between the fs shape and the direction of current injection .    a simple extension of the 2d btk theory to the 3d case",
    "can be realized under the hypothesis of a spherical fs in the s side of the junction ( the n side is always supposed to have a spherical fs ) as shown in @xcite .",
    "the main point here is to express @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath100 ( if the op is anisotropic ) as a function of both the azimuthal and inclination angles @xmath40 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "of course the specific expressions depend on the direction of current injection and on the particular symmetry of the pair potential . as an example , for a _",
    "a_-axis contact ( always with no mismatch of fermi velocity at the interface ) it is rather easy to show that : @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the expressions of the pair potential seen by the elqs and hlqs , respectively , for the specific symmetry considered . by introducing @xmath115 into the above formulas for @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( equations 6 and 7 ) , and then inserting @xmath118 and the obtained @xmath119 and @xmath120 into equation [ eq : sigma_anis ] it is finally possible to integrate on the two angles arriving at the normalized conductance : @xmath121    the model discussed so far is still implicitly based on the assumption of a spherical fs .",
    "the problem then arises of how to express the _",
    "c_-axis or _",
    "a_-axis conductance in a superconductor with a quasi-2d fs .",
    "this is the case of cuprates or of @xmath122 .",
    "a possible solution , though not really general , is to restrict the integration in @xmath113 to a narrow angular range around @xmath50 as in @xcite . in this way",
    ", the spherical fs of the model is reduced to a almost - cylindrical belt that locally approximates the true , cylindrical fs . in the following , we will instead derive and present a more general approach to a full 3d case , with a fs of arbitrary shape .    just for simplicity we will still limit the calculations to the contribution of only two bands ( thus the band index @xmath123 assumes only the values 1 and 2 ) . as for the directionality of the contact",
    ", we consider here current injections along the _ x _ axis ( _ yz_-plane interface ) and along the _ z _ axis ( _ xy_-plane interface ) , being representative of the typical experimental conditions in single crystals of the fe - based compounds , i.e. _ ab_-plane and _ c_-axis contacts , respectively . from now on the subscript _ x _ or _ z _ will denote the specific expressions to be used for the two contact directions .",
    "the particular shape of the i - th fs is described by the wave vector @xmath124 , while the unitary vector perpendicular to the fs at any point of the reciprocal space is simply given by @xmath125 whose calculation is trivial once the shape of @xmath126-th fs has been chosen .    under the additional ( but reasonable ) hypothesis that the points on the fs are close to the points of maximum symmetry of the energy bands ( i.e. they are close to the top or the bottom of parabolic - like bands ) one can express the fermi velocity at any point as a function of the component of @xmath127 perpendicular to the fs at that point :    @xmath128    where @xmath129 is the effective mass of quasiparticles .",
    "finally , the components of the fermi velocity along a given direction can be simply obtained by projecting @xmath130 along that direction , i.e. @xmath131 and @xmath132 where , of course , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the unitary vectors of the @xmath135 and @xmath136 axis , respectively .",
    "we have now all the ingredients required to calculate the normalized conductance .    by following the approach originally developed in @xcite and recently summarized in @xcite , and by neglecting possible interference effects between bands that can lead to the formation of bound states at the surface @xcite",
    ", we obtain the normalized conductance for current injection along the @xmath135 axis :    @xmath137    where @xmath138^{2}+4z_{x,\\,\\mathrm{i}}^{2}v_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2 } } \\label{eq : tau_3dx}\\ ] ] and @xmath139 has the same expression shown in equation [ eq : sigma_anis ] but now contains the band - associated functions @xmath140 , obtained by substituting the op expressions @xmath141 into the @xmath116 expressions ( equation 6 of subsection [ subsect : symmetry ] ) , and the band - associated , direction - dependent normal transparency @xmath142 .",
    "equation [ eq : tau_3dx ] directly comes from equation [ eq_taun_general ] if the difference in the effective masses of all the particles and quasiparticles involved in the process ( in s and n ) is disregarded .",
    "the condition of no mismatch of fermi velocities across the interface translates here into @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 define a point on the fs ( usually in the @xmath146 plane ) where we suppose the two velocities to be equal . by imposing this condition",
    ", we eliminate the need to know the term @xmath147 which multiplies all the elements at numerator and denominator of equations [ eq : g3dx ] and [ eq : tau_3dx ] . in this way , of course , we neglect the small deviation of the quasiparticles in crossing the interface due to the modest mismatch of fermi velocities in n and s simply arising from the geometry of the fs in s. in equations [ eq : g3dx ] and [ eq : tau_3dx ] @xmath148 and @xmath149 is the barrier height parameter for current injection along the _ x _ axis in the @xmath126-th band . finally , the limits of integration in @xmath113 ( @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) are fixed in such a way that the integration is restricted to the first brillouin zone .",

    "this result is only partially expected .",
    "in fact now the hlqs and the elqs feel the same phase independently of @xmath40 and , thus , interference effects due to phase differences can not occur .",
    "nevertheless , the full integration in @xmath164 gives rise to an average of conductance curves representative of the different gap values that are seen at different directions in the _ ab _ plane .",
    "as it happens in the _",
    "ab_-plane contacts of panel ( a ) , the contribution of arbitrary small ops close to the nodes or zeros should yield zero - bias maxima in the total conductance . but",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the reason is an additional and pure geometric effect .",
    "when the current is injected along a direction mainly parallel to the fs ( as in this case , when the current is injected along the @xmath104 axis ) the normal transparency @xmath153 is markedly reduced in amplitude at any angle and its overall shape is modified accordingly .",
    "it can be easily shown that both these effects can be roughly simulated by inserting a properly enhanced @xmath56 value into the @xmath165 valid for a spherical fs .",
    "for the fs geometries here discussed this @xmath56__-enhancing _ _ effect occurs also in _",
    "ab_-plane contacts but to a quite minor extent since , in this case , most of the fs is almost perpendicular to the direction of current injection . in other words",
    "we can roughly say that , the larger is the projection of the fs along the tunneling direction , the smaller is the @xmath56-enhancing effect . of course , as extreme limits we have the spherical fs",

    "c_-axis contacts on superconductors with warped cylindrical fss can not show zero - bias conductance peaks or maxima even in the presence of _ d_-wave or _ fully anisotropic s_-wave symmetry of the ops . in this case only zero - bias peaks or maxima in _ ab_-plane contacts can give information on the anisotropic symmetry of one or more of the ops but , as shown in figure [ fig:4](a ) , without allowing the complete determination of this symmetry .",
    "in section [ sect : pcar ] we will provide a couple of examples in which zero - bias maxima have been observed experimentally in single crystals and polycrystals of fe - based compounds of different families .    these results are also interesting from another point of view . by reversing the previous reasoning",
    "one can say that if the op on a fs sheet has a _",
    "d_-wave or _ fully anisotropic s_-wave symmetry and ar experiments in _ c_-axis direction do show zero - bias peaks or maxima , it means that the @xmath56-enhancing effect is negligible , i.e. this fs sheet has a large projected area on the @xmath167 plane . in materials layered along the _ ab _ plane , this occurs when the fs sheet has a closed surface , i.e. when it is three - dimensional .",
    "this situation can be easily simulated by substituting one of the two fss of figure [ fig:3 ] with an oblate or prolate spheroid , but a detailed discussion of these results is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the only important message we would like to leave here is that in some particular situations , e.g. in presence of anisotropic pair potentials , _ directional _ point - contact ar spectroscopy can provide information not only on the _ symmetry of the ops _ but also on the _ geometry of fs sheets _ where the superconducting gaps open .",
    "a less univocal and drastic , but still interesting information on the fs geometry comes in any case from the observation that in the framework of this full 3d btk model the weight factor of every band in the total normalized conductance comes directly from the fs topology and the directionality of the contact and _ is not _ a fit parameter as in the standard two - band fitting approach .",
    "it means that once the geometry of fs sheets is fixed ( e.g. by first - principle band - structure calculations ) it is then possible to compare the experimental pcar results with the theoretical 3d btk predictions getting information on the true fs topology as compared to the theoretical one .",
    "just as an example , we report here the weight factors of bands 1 and 2 coming from the results shown in figure [ fig:4 ] and , thus , for the geometries shown in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "they are : @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "these numbers are not far from the actual values obtained in pcar experiments on fe - based superconductors , particularly as far as @xmath172 is concerned @xcite .    in principle , one should always use this full 3d model in fitting the experimental data .",
    "however , i ) the 3d model is rather complicated to handle as a fitting tool ; ii ) it requires the knowledge of the fs geometry , which is not always available ; iii ) most of the fe - based superconductors have quasi-2d fermi surfaces so that the 2d model can be safely used as a first approximation .",
    "indeed , the difference between the 3d and the 2d models is dramatic only along the c axis , and in the case of _ d_-wave or anisotropic _ s_-wave symmetry as shown in figure [ fig:4 ] . in the case of _ s_-wave symmetry it is possible to show that the results obtained with the 2d model are totally compatible with those of the full 3d one .",
    "for example , we calculated the normalized conductances for injection along the _ ab _ plane and along the _ c _ axis by using the full 3d model , using a 3d fs made of two moderately - warped one - sheeted hyperboloids of revolution .",
    "the two _ s_-wave gaps and the other parameters used in the calculation are the same as in figure [ fig:4 ] , except the barrier heights that here are @xmath173 .",
    "when the theoretical 3d conductance curves are fitted by the 2d btk model the resulting parameters are perfectly coincident with the starting ones ( including the weights of band 1 and 2 ) with only the expected exception of the parameter @xmath56 that results about 20% larger along _ ab _ plane and 2.8 - 3.6 times larger than the actual one in the fit of the _ c_-axis conductance , due to the mentioned @xmath56-enhancing effect . as a consequence , in _",
    "s_-wave symmetry , the use of the fully 3d model is mandatory only if a precise determination of the @xmath56 parameters is required .    in this rather long subsection we have discussed in detail the effects of fs geometry and directionality of the contact on the results of point - contact ar spectroscopy in multiband multi - gap superconductors like the fe - based ones . in the next subsection we will focus instead on the effect in pcar curves of the presence of a strong electron - boson interaction and on the role played by the shape of the electron - boson spectral function , by appropriately solving a three - band @xmath11 eliashberg model for the determination of the @xmath174 functions to be inserted in the above reported expressions for the normalized conductance .",
    "it is well known that , in the bcs theory , the op does not depend on energy .",
    "this is not the case when the eliashberg theory of superconductivity is adopted . by starting from the electron - boson spectral function @xmath175",
    "it is indeed possible , within the eliashberg approach , to account for the full energy dependence of the op which is now described by a complex function of energy , @xmath176 . in particular , as the strength of the coupling increases , the imaginary part also increases and small deviations from the bcs density of states can be observed at the typical boson energies . in the moderate / strong - coupling regime",
    "these deviations can be experimentally detected by tunnelling and pcar spectroscopy .        from the theoretical point of view , a precise knowledge of the shape of the spectral function is not really necessary , at least to a first approximation , to calculate @xmath13 , the gaps etc . within the eliashberg theory , since these quantities mostly depend on the representative frequency of @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "however , we will show in the following that the shape of the spectral function and the maximum boson energy affect the possibility to observe electron - boson interaction features in the andreev - reflection spectra . in this regard",
    ", we will compare different shapes of the spectral function , namely a lorentzian function @xcite ( see inset to figure [ fig5]a ) and the typical antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( afsf ) spectral function @xcite ( inset to figure [ fig5](c ) ) .",
    "the effect of the shape of the spectral function on the electron - boson features will be discussed within a three - band , s@xmath177 eliashberg model which revealed useful in describing several fe - based superconductors @xcite . within this model , the electronic structure of fe - based superconductors",
    "is described by two hole bands and one equivalent electron band in the case of hole doping , and by two electronic bands and one equivalent hole band in the case of electron doping .",
    "the other main assumptions of the model are that : i ) the total electron - phonon coupling constant is small @xcite ; ii ) phonons mainly provide intraband coupling ; iii ) spin fluctuations mainly provide interband coupling .",
    "we will choose , as a representative example , the compound ba(fe@xmath178co@xmath179)@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath56 , @xmath180 etc . ) will be indexed according to the bands , i.e. 1 for the hole fs , 2 and 3 for the electron fs sheets .",
    "further details on the model and on the parameters of the calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5](a ) shows several andreev - reflection conductance curves calculated by using a three - band 2d btk model ( equation [ eq : g2d ] ) in which , however , the ops are not constant but energy - dependent .",
    "the functions @xmath181 were previously calculated within the aforementioned three - band eliashberg model by using coupling constants able to give @xmath13 and gaps similar to the experimental ones .",
    "the @xmath182 was chosen to have a lorentzian shape , with representative boson frequency @xmath183 mev , similar to the spin - resonance energy obtained from neutron scattering experiments in @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "the curves in figure [ fig5](a ) refer to different values of the z parameters ( @xmath185 ) from 0 ( ideal ar contact with no barrier ) to 20 ( tunnel regime ) .",
    "each conductance curve is the sum of three contributions ( one for each band of the model ) whose relative weight have been here chosen to be equal , @xmath186 .",
    "the other parameters of the btk model have been chosen so as to compare to real experimental situations , i.e. @xmath187 k , @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the calculated conductance curves in figure [ fig5](a ) feature structures at energies higher than the gap values , at about @xmath190 mev , which become more pronounced as @xmath56 increases .",
    "the features can be seen much more clearly by looking at the sign - changed derivative of the conductance , @xmath191 shown in figure [ fig5](b ) .",
    "a peak is present above 20 mev and an additional feature can be also seen around 40 mev ( vertical dashed lines ) .",
    "when @xmath56 decreases , the structures slightly reduce in amplitude but their position in energy hardly changes , showing that important information concerning electron - boson interaction can be obtained in the andreev - reflection regime as well .",
    "figure [ fig5](c ) shows the same cases as in ( a ) but now calculated by adopting a normal afsf spectral function , with maximum at @xmath192 mev and maximum boson energy ( @xmath193 mev ) . here",
    "the total coupling constant @xmath194 is fixed so as to give ( approximately ) the same @xmath13 and the same gaps as in panel ( a ) .",
    "the additional structures are no longer visible in the conductance curves at any value of the @xmath56 parameter .",
    "only tiny deviations from the bcs case can be seen in the sign - changed derivative ( not shown ) but these features would be hardly observable in a real experiment .",
    "figure [ fig5](d ) shows what happens if the value of @xmath195 is reduced , though scaling @xmath196 so as to give the same @xmath13 and gaps ( see the inset ) . if @xmath197 small additional structures start to become visible and they grow consistently in amplitude when @xmath198 , but now they are at @xmath199 and not at @xmath200 . summarizing , in this case the electron - boson interaction structures are detectable only if the spectral function is abruptly cutoff resulting in a shape no more physically plausible ( see inset to figure [ fig5](d ) ) and are located at energies that have nothing to do with the representative boson energy @xmath201 .",
    "the conclusion is that reasonable parameters for the normal afsf spectral function do not allow reproducing features that are actually observed in the experiment ( see section [ sect : ebiinfebased ] ) .",
    "hence , we suggest that this particular shape of the @xmath175 is not suitable to catch finer details of the pcar spectra measured in these compounds .",
    "this fact , however , may not be surprising since the afsf function used here was calculated for a uniform electron gas in the normal state @xcite which looks too rough an approximation in this case . very recently , the afsf electron - boson spectral function in the superconducting state has been calculated @xcite and is indeed rather similar to the lorentzian @xmath175 used above , which is thus a reasonable and easy - to - handle approximation .",
    "[ h ]    figure [ fig6](a ) shows an andreev - reflection spectrum ( solid line ) calculated at @xmath202 k , @xmath203 and @xmath189 by using a lorentzian spectral function , together with the partial contributions from the three bands present in the model ( dash - dot lines ) .",
    "each of the three partial conductance curves shows strong - coupling structures at energies higher than the gap .",
    "however , while in a single - band case one could expect these features to appear at @xmath204 ( and potentially at higher harmonics ) , in a three - band case with a dominant interband pairing the situation is not so straightforward .",
    "for instance , the contribution of band 2 features a peak at @xmath205 mev and not at @xmath206 .",
    "this fact , which is most probably due to the strong interband character of the coupling , has to be investigated further and suggests that quantitative calculations are recommended in order to reliably interpret electron - boson features in fe - based superconductors .",
    "figure [ fig6](b ) shows what happens when the total conductance of panel ( a ) , here represented by circles , is fitted to the two - band 2d btk model which adopts constant bcs energy gaps ( solid line ) .",
    "the agreement between the two curves is remarkable in the gap region , despite the fact that the btk model contains only _ two _ gaps ( a three - band model would contain too many parameters for the fit to be reliable ) .",
    "the fit allows determining very well the small gap ( 4.0 mev against 4.02 mev , see the parameters in the labels ) .",
    "the large gap obtained by the fit is similar to @xmath207 given by the eliashberg theory , with a slight overestimation ( 9.9 mev against 9.02 mev ) ; the effect of the intermediate gap is a hardly visible excess of signal with respect to the fitting curve between the extremal gaps , which is indeed sometimes observed experimentally . at higher energies a considerable deviation from the fit is observed : the calculated conductance shows additional features together with a higher conductance up to about 60 mev .",
    "such an excess of conductance at intermediate energy has been observed rather often by pcar in fe - based superconductors ( see figure 2d and 2e from @xcite or figure [ fig13](a ) below ) .",
    "furthermore , a higher - energy excess conductance that some calculated curves show for particular bands can cause an increase of the amplitude of the tails even up to 80 - 100 mev , as shown in figure [ fig13](a ) and in the inset to figure [ fig : yates](a ) .",
    "this effect can be a further evidence of the strong - coupling character of these compounds .",
    "however , since the height of the tails at high energy in the experimental curves depends on the normalization procedure , one must be confident that the actual normal state is adopted , i.e. the curve at low temperature and @xmath208 . since the upper critical field in these compounds is usually not experimentally accessible",
    ", one could try using the normal state at @xmath209 , provided that no heating effects are present in the point - contact which could cause a downward shift of the conductance curves with increasing temperature .",
    "therefore , a systematic study of this effect is desirable , both from the experimental and theoretical point of view , as it could greatly help acquiring more information concerning the strength of the coupling and the energy of the mediating boson in fe - based superconductors .    the fact that in the above discussion we have compared the same data to either a two - band btk model with constant ( energy - independent ) ops or a three - band btk model with energy - dependent ops might look a little confusing .",
    "let us just explain this point .",
    "one one hand , if one starts from an experimental pcar spectrum , the _ minimal _ btk model able to fit the data  at least in the small - to - intermediate energy range  is the two - band btk one . in some spectra ,",
    "a discrepancy between the data and the fitting curve is observed at energies between the small and the large gap , which might be due to the presence of a third gap , which is however experimentally difficult to discern .",
    "moreover , this discrepancy is too small to justify the use of a three - band btk model that would contain 11 free parameters and , thus , would not be reliable . in this sense ,",
    "the large uncertainty on the gap @xmath210 ( especially in the case of sm-1111 ) might partly arise from the oversimplification of the fitting model .",
    "even if this fact has not prevented obtaining interesting information by pcar measurements , this consideration has to be kept well in mind when studying these complex multiband systems .    on the other hand , the _ minimal _ eliashberg @xmath11 model that allows obtaining the experimental gaps and",
    "@xmath211 is a three - band , three - gap one as explained in @xcite .",
    "if one wants to take into account the effects of the energy dependence of the ops and of the strong electron - boson coupling on the shape of the pcar spectrum , one is thus forced to generate the andreev - reflection curve by using a three - band btk model with the three ops coming from eliashberg calculations .",
    "note that , in the latter case , the ops are not fitting parameters and only @xmath212 , @xmath213 and the weights can be adjusted to `` fit '' the experimental spectrum .",
    "in most of the 1111 compounds , the model for spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity predicts a @xmath11 gap symmetry with a sign change between hole - like and electron - like fermi surface sheets .",
    "this is indeed compatible with what has been found by point - contact measurements , despite initial contradicting claims .",
    "an order parameter with nodes on the electron fs has been predicted in 1111 compounds with low @xmath13 @xcite which have not been studied yet by pcar .",
    "the first pcar measurements in 1111 materials like lafeas(o , f ) and smfeas(o , f ) showed zero - bias peaks that were initially interpreted as being due to a nodal gap symmetry , namely the @xmath1-wave one .",
    "however , the appearance of these zero - bias features and their height were later discovered to depend on the pressure applied to the sample by the tip ( in the needle - anvil configuration ) @xcite ; in some samples , they were frequently found in some regions of the sample surface and never in others ; moreover , their temperature dependence was odd and completely inconsistent with that expected for the zero - bias peak associated with andreev bound states in nodal superconductors @xcite . at the same time and most importantly , increasing pieces of evidence were collected that , in suitable conditions ( better sample quality , or zero pressure applied to the sample as in the `` soft '' technique described in @xcite ) the zero - bias peak did not show up @xcite . in the end , the majority of the scientific community got convinced that the zero - bias peaks early observed in 1111 compounds were not a signature of @xmath1-wave symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "we will thus not discuss these results any longer ; a short review on this subject can be found in @xcite .",
    "the absence of zero - energy bound states ( particularly in @xmath83-plane contacts ) certainly excludes those symmetries where nodal lines lie on the fermi surface .",
    "however , the predicted symmetry of the op in pnictides does involve a change of sign in the op , but this should occur _ between _ hole - like and electron - like fermi surface sheets @xcite . according to some models , this sign change should give rise to observable effects in the pcar spectra through interband interference effects . the article by greene et al . in this same issue",
    "is specifically devoted to exploring these models and comparing their predictions to experiments . here",
    "we will not deal with this aspect and show instead how the most reliable pcar spectra in 1111 can be successfully fitted by simpler models that disregard interference effects .",
    "indeed , the predicted features associated with interband interference ( i.e. surface bound states , both at zero and nonzero energies @xcite ) may be often made indiscernible by various sources of broadening or overwhelmed by stronger effects .",
    "it is however worth mentioning that , in contacts with vanishing barrier at the interface ( let s say , @xmath42 in the btk language ) , a strong reduction in the andreev signal is predicted @xcite as a result of destructive interference . in fe - based superconductors a smaller amplitude of the andreev signal than in more conventional systems ( even multiband , like mgb@xmath2 )",
    "is indeed often ( but not always ) observed experimentally .",
    "however , a similar reduction in the amplitude of the superconducting signal is also expected if the normal bank of the contact is a diffusive metal @xcite , if a large inelastic scattering occurs at the interface @xcite , if a fraction of the probe current is injected in normal regions ( as it can happen if the dopant distribution is inhomogeneous ) , or even if some fermi surface sheets are gapless . for the sake of completeness , it must be said that a small andreev signal is also predicted if the gap is anisotropic ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) . at this stage of the research",
    "it is impossible to say which of these effects is really taking place .",
    "this is particularly true for 1111 , since the growth of large single crystals is still very difficult and most of the experiments have been carried out on polycrystalline samples which necessarily do not allow ruling out extrinsic effects due to grain boundaries , surface degradation , inhomogeneous doping and so on .",
    "lafeas(o@xmath214f@xmath215 ) is chronologically the first fe - based superconductor studied by point - contact spectroscopy , and also the first on which we performed `` soft '' pcar measurement ( where the contact is made by placing a small drop of ag paste on the sample surface instead of pressing a sharp metallic tip against it ) to avoid pressure effects that could possibly give rise to spurious zero - bias peaks , as shown in some early measurements reported in literature .",
    "+ we studied polycrystalline samples with nominal f content @xmath216 and thus at optimal doping .",
    "however , the local f concentration in the crystallites was found to show deviations @xmath217 around this value .",
    "indeed , point contacts on different regions gave critical temperatures @xmath218 ( defined as the temperature where the andreev - reflection features disappear and the normal - state spectrum is recovered ) ranging from 27.3 k to 31.0 k. these temperatures lie in the upper part of the resistive transition ( see figure [ fig : la1111](e ) ) .",
    "in most of the contacts we observed clear conductance maxima , symmetric about zero bias and related to a small gap @xmath219 , together with additional structures that we interpreted as being due to a larger order parameter @xmath210 ( although we acknowledged the possibility that they could be features of the normal state , which is also changing with temperature @xcite ) . in some contacts ,",
    "these additional features were extremely clear and sharp ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) ; in others ( see figure [ fig : la1111](a ) ) they showed up as broad shoulders progressively decreasing in height and width on increasing temperature .",
    "other peculiar features of the spectra are the right - left asymmetry , and the residual upward curvature in the normal - state conductance that looks like a `` pseudogap '' feature and is progressively reduced on increasing the temperature .",
    "curiously enough , the temperature at which it disappears , leaving a flat but asymmetric conductance , is close to the temperature of magnetic ordering in the parent compound .",
    "the origin of this behaviour is still not clear and will be possibly clarified only when single crystals are available ( see also [ subsec sm ] for further discussion ) .",
    "+    the complete absence of zero - bias peaks or maxima such as those shown in figure [ fig:4 ] in the conductance , together with the random orientation of the grains , made us conclude that none of the order parameters shows line nodes or zeros on the fermi surface .",
    "the further conclusion in favor of a isotropic gap symmetry came instead from the fit of the conductance curves , which was indeed always possible by using two isotropic order parameters .",
    "the fit requires of course a normalization of the conductance curves , which is particularly crucial in these materials ( as already mentioned in section [ subsect : ebi ] ) because the gap or boson structures can extend to very high energy . in some spectra , these structures become clearly visible only if a proper normalization is chosen . in principle",
    ", the normalization should be obtained by dividing the superconducting conductance curve measured at a given @xmath220 by the normal - state one at the same temperature .",
    "the latter is experimentally inaccessible due to the large critical fields of these materials @xcite .",
    "some authors then choose to divide the raw conductance curve at a given temperature by a straight line @xcite that connects its high - energy `` tails '' .",
    "this procedure generally allows a good estimation of the small gap alone . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the pseudogaplike curvature of the normal - state conductance curves observed at @xmath221 is presumably present also below @xmath218 ( and likely to become more and more pronounced when the temperature is lowered ) .",
    "this curvature is completely disregarded by the aforementioned normalization procedure . to partially correct for this ,",
    "a possibility is to divide all the raw conductance curves in the superconducting state by the normal - state curve measured just above @xmath218 , or ( as we also did in la-1111 ) to try to mimic the temperature dependence of the ( presumed ) normal state @xcite .",
    "we showed that choosing one or another of these two procedures changes very little the value of @xmath219 extracted from the fit ( less than 2% ) , while the value of @xmath210 can change by about 10% , though preserving its trend as a function of temperature , magnetic field and critical temperature .",
    "figure [ fig : la1111](c ) shows the low - temperature experimental curve of panel ( a ) after normalization ( i.e. division by the normal state at @xmath218 ) , together with its best - fitting curve calculated within the two - gap 2d btk model discussed in section [ subsect : btk ] .",
    "let us just recall here that this model is really suited to describe a 3d superconductor only if the gap is isotropic and the fermi surface is spherical , which is clearly not the case in these materials @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated models accounting for the real shape of the fermi surface ( see section [ subsect : fs ] ) should thus be used , but calculations may become too heavy for a fitting procedure to converge . in practice , using an approximated 2d model often simply results in an overestimation of the barrier parameter @xmath56 , as already mentioned in section [ subsect : fs ] .",
    "the values of the ops extracted from the fit of the low - temperature conductance curve are @xmath222 mev and @xmath223 mev .",
    "the fit of another set of curves measured in a point contact with @xmath224 k , but featuring clearer structures related to the second gap , gives instead @xmath225 mev and @xmath226 mev .",
    "how can these result be reconciled with the @xmath11 picture ?",
    "as already mentioned above ( section [ subsect : ebi ] ) we have shown @xcite that the @xmath11 picture is compatible with the opening of gaps of different amplitude on the two hole - like fs sheets and on the electron - like sheet of hole - doped 1111 compounds .",
    "eliashberg calculations assuming a mainly - interband coupling due to spin fluctations give , for the case of lafeas(o , f ) analyzed here , three isotropic order parameters of different signs : a small positive op @xmath227 mev ( presumably on the outer hole fs cylinder around @xmath23 ) , a large positive op @xmath228 mev ( on the inner hole fs cylinder ) , and a large negative op @xmath229 mev ( on the electron fs sheets around m ) @xcite . in the absence of interband interference effects , andreev reflection is only sensitive to the amplitude ( i.e. the absolute value ) of the ops ( which is the actual energy gap ) .",
    "this , together with the similarity between the absolute values of the two large ops , reconciles the findings of pcar with the theoretical expectations in the @xmath11 model .",
    "the gaps ( or , better , the relevant @xmath230 ratios ) extracted from the fit of the conductance curves in figure [ fig : la1111](a ) are shown as solid squares in panel ( f ) .",
    "their temperature dependence is anomalous ; both @xmath219 and @xmath210 follow a bcs - like trend up to @xmath231 k , but above this temperature @xmath210 is no longer detectable and @xmath219 shows a `` tail '' ending up at the real critical temperature of the contact , @xmath232 k. the same result was found in other contacts with different critical temperature @xcite .",
    "the data shown by open squares in [ fig : la1111](f ) refer to a contact with @xmath224 k on the same sample ; also in this case the large gap tends to zero at @xmath233 k , and above this temperature the small gap shows a `` tail '' up to the real @xmath218 .",
    "very similar results have been recently obtained by naidyuk _",
    "_ @xcite who performed pcar spectroscopy with a cu tip in lafeaso@xmath214f@xmath215 films with @xmath234 k ( defined as the temperature where the resistance drops to 90% of its normal - state value , see figure [ fig : la1111](e ) ) and a transition width @xmath235 k. the conductance curves @xmath236 obtained from their data are shown in figure [ fig : la1111](b ) , and show two clear maxima related to a small gap @xmath219 .",
    "the authors normalized the curves to a parabolic curve that fits the data for @xmath237 mv .",
    "this necessarily makes all the features at @xmath238 become small oscillations around 1 in the normalized curve . as a matter of fact",
    ", the curves normalized in this way can be fitted by a single - band , @xmath92-wave btk model including a broadening term and the fit thus gives only a small gap , shown in panel ( f ) as circles .",
    "the gap follows a bcs - like curve that , once extrapolated , would give again a critical temperature @xmath231 k. structures in the raw conductance curves , although impossible to fit with the same model , persisted well above that temperature and at least up to 25 k , as shown in panel b. as a matter of fact , the temperature dependence of the raw conductance curves is not dissimilar from that observed by us in polycrystals ( panel a ) .",
    "let us show what happens instead if one normalizes the same curves by the normal state at @xmath218 .",
    "although the corresponding curve is not reported in @xcite , based on the similarity with panel ( a ) one can guess that it should look like the dashed curve in panel ( b ) .",
    "if this is used to normalize the low - temperature spectrum , one obtains the curve depicted in panel ( d ) , which shows a rather high andreev signal and shows clear shoulders in addition to the structures related to @xmath219 .",
    "the two - band 2d model allows fitting this curve very well , giving @xmath239 mev and @xmath240 mev ( triangles in panel f ) .",
    "the agreement between the data sets measured by us in polycrystals and by naidyuk _",
    "et al . _ in films is incredibly good if the raw conductance curves are treated in the same way .",
    "this proves that : i ) the different sets of data are really compatible with each other ; ii ) even if in the raw data by naidyuk et al .",
    "the large - gap features are not as clear as in ours , a suitable normalization makes them show up clearly enough to be fitted by the 2d model ; iii ) the gap values are rather robust against the sample form and synthesis technique , provided that the critical temperature is similar , as in this case . the two data sets , however , also pose some questions on whether the observed anomalous tendency of the gaps to close around @xmath241 is an artifact or is intrinsic to this material .",
    "the simplest possibility , of course , is that the behavior of the gap is the result of the shortening of the mean free path on increasing temperature , so that the junction ceases to be ballistic at a voltage that decreases with temperature @xcite .",
    "also in sm-1111 the pcar results reported in literature apparently give contradicting results , especially as far as the observability of multiple gaps is concerned . here",
    "we will show that , however , raw data measured in different kinds of samples by different groups can give surprisingly consistent results if they are treated in the same way .",
    "figure [ fig : sm1111 ] ( a ) shows the raw conductance curves measured by using the `` soft '' pcar technique in a optimally doped smfeaso@xmath242f@xmath243 polycrystal with @xmath244 k. we can notice that : i ) the low temperature curve shows maxima at about @xmath245 mv , plus additional structures ( here in the form of shoulders ) at about @xmath246 mv ; ii ) the normal - state conductance ( thick line , corresponding to @xmath247 k ) is not flat but shows a residual , asymmetric `` hump '' around zero bias , which is progressively smoothed on increasing temperature . in _",
    "all _ the soft point contacts we made in these polycrystals , this hump disappears  leaving a flat , though still asymmetric conductance  at about 140 -150 k ( which is the temperature of magnetic ordering in the parent compound ) @xcite .",
    "the origin of this `` crossover '' is unclear .",
    "one could doubt that it might be related to some residual magnetic order , but no trace of a secondary magnetic phase with t@xmath248 k has been observed in our samples at optimal doping ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a structural transition has been claimed to occur between 175 k and 125 k along the whole phase diagram of sm-1111 @xcite , but we do nt have evidence of this effect in the samples studied here . a small anomalous kink in the resistivity at similar temperatures , common to 1111 compounds ( see e.g. @xcite ) , has been instead observed , but its origin is not well understood yet .",
    "transport measurements @xcite and arpes @xcite in detwinned bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 crystals showed that in - plane electronic anisotropy occurs at temperatures above the structural transition , thus indicating the presence of fluctuation effects @xcite which have been interpreted as spin anisotropy in the paramagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "it might also be that similar effects are playing a role in the 1111 systems and are possibly connected to the kink in the resistivity and to the shape of the point - contact conductance .",
    "however , detailed studies have to be performed as soon as bigger crystals are available to clarify these points . generally speaking , we can say that the proximity of superconductivity to the af sdw state of the parent compound suggests the persistence , in the doped compound , of spin fluctuations which could possibly give rise to the observed behavior of the normal state at high temperatures .",
    "however , since there are no clear predictions concerning the expected shape of the pcar conductance spectra and of their evolution with temperature in the situations reported above , further experimental and theoretical investigation should be performed in order to clarify this issue .",
    "then , it could also be possible to better understand whether the different shape of the normal - state conductance in la-1111 and sm-1111 polycrystals is due to different causes or it is only a different appearance of the same phenomenon .",
    "+    anyway , the anomalous shape of the normal - state conductance makes again the normalization be a problem .",
    "dividing by the curve at @xmath218 is here a rougher approximation than in la-1111 because the critical temperature is higher and one could reasonably suspect that the normal state at @xmath218 can differ very much from that at low temperature .",
    "the result of such a normalization is shown in panel ( c ) for the curve at the lowest temperature .",
    "the normalized curve still presents a strong right - left asymmetry , that some authors remove by a symmetrization procedure .",
    "we chose instead to separately fit the left and right side of the curves with the two - band 2d btk model , as shown by the lines superimposed to the symbols in panel ( c ) .",
    "the values of the small gap @xmath219 extracted from the two fits ( 5.7 mev ) coincide , but the values of @xmath210 are rather different : 17.0 and 19.0 mev , respectively .",
    "the fit of the symmetrized conductance obtained from the one reported in figure [ fig : sm1111](c ) gives @xmath249 mev and @xmath250 mev . while the small gap remains the same the large gap is actually an average of those obtained from the separate fit of the right and left side of the unsymmetrized one .",
    "the symmetrization is thus an acceptable practice when the asymmetry of the conductance curve is not too large .",
    "this is what happened in case of co - doped ba-122 ( see @xcite ) where we symmetrized the conductance spectra .",
    "since in our results on sm-1111 the curves show a rather large asymmetry we consider more reliable , in that specific situation , a separate fit .",
    "the temperature dependence of the ops ( normalized as in figure [ fig : la1111](f ) ) obtained in this way is shown in panel ( e ) by up ( left side ) and down ( right side ) triangles .",
    "unlike in la-1111 , the gaps follow a bcs - like trend up to @xmath218 , that coincides with the bulk @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the same panel also shows the gaps obtained by fitting the negative - bias side of conductance curves obtained in a different polycrystal , with a different doping content ( @xmath251 ) and thus a smaller @xmath252 k ( open circles ) . despite these differences ,",
    "once the temperature and energy scales are normalized as in panel ( e ) , the values of the gaps agree very well with those obtained for @xmath253 @xcite .",
    "a few measurements of soft pcar spectroscopy were also performed in very small sm-1111 single crystals ( about @xmath254 ) with the current ( mainly ) injected along the @xmath83 planes @xcite . as usual , we fitted the negative - bias and the positive - bias side separately to account for the observed strong asymmetry of the spectra . at low temperature , the gaps turned out to be @xmath255 mev and @xmath256 mev , while @xmath257 k. the normalized values of the gaps ( actually , the values of the gap ratio @xmath258 ) are shown as a function of @xmath259 in figure [ fig : sm1111](e ) as squares and diamonds .",
    "the agreement of the data with those obtained in polycrystals is remarkable . in general , when all the data sets obtained in various polycrystals and crystals are considered together , the values of the @xmath260 agree very well with one another , varying only between 2.5 and 3 ( i.e. within the thinner colored region in panel ( e ) ) . as for @xmath261 ,",
    "it is more scattered and varies at low temperature between 7 and 9 ( i.e. within the wider colored region ) .",
    "this larger spread arises both from the asymmetry of the curves and from the greater uncertainty in the determination of the large gap , also related to the uncertainty introduced by the normalization or to the possible presence of two large gaps of similar amplitude .",
    "pcar measurements in the needle - anvil configuration were performed by chen et al . in polycrystals with a reduced @xmath262",
    "k with respect to the optimal - doping one @xcite .",
    "most of the low - temperature curves shown in @xcite resemble rather closely those measured by us ; they present clear peaks related to a small gap plus additional shoulders and structures .",
    "unlike in our measurements , the normal - state conductance above @xmath218 presents a pseudogaplike upward curvature similar to that reported above for la-1111 .",
    "prior to fitting their curves , the authors use a normalization procedure that is equivalent to supposing that the normal state is a straight line fitting the tails of the unnormalized curve .",
    "the problem is that , the higher is the temperature , the smaller is the voltage range where this approximation holds ( see supplementary information in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , this obviously implies disregarding possible structures at energies much higher than that of the small gap .",
    "traces of the ( presumable ) large gap remain in the curves , but become so small to be confused with minor features , possibly related to the electron - boson coupling ( see [ subsect : ebi ] and [ sect : ebiinfebased ] ) . instead ,",
    "if the curves are divided by the normal - state conductance , the features connected to the large gap are enhanced with respect to other features at even higher energy .",
    "the fit of the conductance curves performed by chen et al .",
    "gives indeed a single gap , which follows an almost perfect bcs temperature dependence shown in figure [ fig : sm1111](e ) as solid stars ( note that , because of the difference in critical temperature between different data sets , the axes are normalized ) . in @xcite",
    "the same authors notice that the energy of some extra features ( which at @xmath263 k occur at about 20 , 40 and 55 mev ) evolve in a bcs - like way on increasing temperature so that , if properly normalized to its low-@xmath70 values , all the curves are superimposed to the gap . on the basis of what discussed in section [ subsect : ebi ]",
    ", it is tempting to interpret these features as the hallmarks of the strong electron - boson coupling .",
    "more recently , pcar measurements in the needle - anvil configuration have been performed in sm-1111 films by naidyuk et al .",
    "figure [ fig : sm1111](b ) shows the temperature dependence of one of their curves , which show very clear structures related to the small gap and a pseudogaplike normal state .",
    "the peculiar evolution of the tails of the curves as a function of temperature seems to indicate a large excess conductance at high energy , possibly due to electron - boson structures , as discussed in section [ subsect : ebi ] .",
    "features connected to the superconductivity are clearly present up to @xmath264 k. this is the temperature where the resistance has dropped to about 80% of the normal - state value , although the transition starts at about 34 k. as in la-1111 , the authors normalization makes the andreev signal decay to 1 already at @xmath265 mev , thus flattening all the structures at higher energy .",
    "this , again , allows a fit of the small - gap features alone , and only to about 18 k ; above this temperature the normalization produces structures that can not be fitted by a btk model .",
    "the gap values follow a bcs - like trend that , if extrapolated , would give a critical temperature @xmath266 k. this , together with the low - temperature value @xmath267 mev , gives an almost perfect bcs ratio @xmath268 . however , the `` true '' critical temperature of the contact is @xmath269 k , that gives instead a gap ratio of only 2.6 , _ which is exactly the same we obtained for the small gap _ ( see figure [ fig : sm1111](e ) ) .",
    "based on this similarity , we tried to normalize the curves in @xcite following our method , and then divided all the curves by the presumable normal state at @xmath218 ( dashed curve in panel b ) .",
    "the result of this normalization ( and of a subsequent symmetrization ) is shown by symbols in panel ( d ) .",
    "the curve has then been fitted to a single - band 2d btk model ( dashed line ) and to a 2-band 2d model ( solid red line ) .",
    "it is clear that the two - gap model allows a better fit of the small - gap feature s width but also catches the position of the abrupt change of curvature , which turns out to be related to the second large gap .",
    "the values of the gaps given by this tentative fit are @xmath270 mev and @xmath271 mev .",
    "their values , properly referred to the relevant @xmath218 , are shown in panel ( e ) as green stars and again turn out to be in very good agreement with ours .",
    "the failure of the 2d btk model to fit the tails of the curve in ( d ) is not too worrying ; the shape of these tails is indeed suggestive of strong electron - boson structures in the conductance that could only taken into account by inserting the energy - dependent order parameters into the 2d btk model ( see section [ subsect : ebi ] ) .      in 122 compounds , the model for spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity",
    "predicts a nodeless op which , according to some authors , can however evolve in a peculiar nodal symmetry , with three - dimensional nodes on one hole - like fermi surface , when the latter acquires a more three - dimensional character @xcite . in a recent paper , a relationship is claimed between @xmath272 ( being @xmath273 the gap on the hole - fs ) and the occurrence of nodes in the _ electron _ fs @xcite . according to these authors , both the hole - doped system ( ba , k)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 and the electron - doped system ba(fe , co)@xmath2as@xmath2 present nodeless gaps around optimal doping , while a nodal op is very likely in the isovalent - doped compound bafe@xmath2(as , p)@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "122 compounds are more suited to pcar measurements than 1111 compounds , since they can be grown in the form of large single crystals that can be cleaved more or less easily .",
    "this allows directional measurements with the probe current injected either in the basal plane or along the @xmath104 axis .",
    "moreover , in some of these compounds , arpes measurements have provided valuable information on the amplitude and symmetry of the gap on the various sheets of the fs .",
    "this information generally confirms or supports the finding of pcar in these materials .",
    "arpes experiments in the hole - doped system ( ba , k)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 at @xmath274 ( t@xmath275 k ) @xcite showed the presence of four isotropic gaps : three of similar amplitude ( between 11 and 13 mev ) on the inner hole - like fs cylinder and on the two electron - fs sheets around m , plus a small one ( @xmath276 mev ) on the outer hole fs sheet . within the uncertainty of the measurement , which is rather large ,",
    "the gap amplitudes were shown to be compatible with a symmetry @xmath277 which is indeed the functional form of the @xmath11 symmetry in the reciprocal space .",
    "the gaps seemed not to follow a bcs - like curve as a function of temperature .",
    "the first directional pcar measurements in the same system were carried out by samuely et al .",
    "@xcite who used single crystals of ba@xmath278k@xmath279fe@xmath2as@xmath2 with superconducting transition between @xmath280 k and @xmath281 k. by injecting the current along the @xmath83 planes , they obtained spectra with very clear two - gap structures and no trace of zero - bias peaks or maxima , thus ruling out the possibility of any symmetry of the op involving a change of sign or zeros on a single fs sheet .",
    "the conductance curves were systematically normalized to the conductance curve at @xmath218 , which sometimes shows a humplike structure ( similar to that observed by us in sm-1111 polycrystals ) and sometimes a pseudogaplike , v - shaped feature . for current injection along the @xmath104 axis , a similar pseudogaplike feature and no andreev signal were observed .",
    "the zero - bias conductance minimum was shown to be progressively filled on increasing temperature , up to the temperature ( about 85 k in these samples ) where weak signs of the onset of a magnetic order are found in resistivity and specific heat @xcite .",
    "the most reasonable interpretation of these findings is that magnetic order and superconductivity coexist and are probed sometimes together , sometimes exclusively , by pcar @xcite . this possibility is confirmed by direct evidences of such a phase separation on a scale of about 50 nm @xcite , and also by successive pcar measurements in ba@xmath282k@xmath283fe@xmath2as@xmath2 crystals with @xmath284 k carried out by lu et al",

    "let us go back to the @xmath83-plane measurements in ( ba , k)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 by samuely et al .",

    "more exotic symmetries ( if any ) should be imagined to make hlq and elq experience a sign change of the pairing potential in this configuration .",
    "alternatively , one could imagine the zero - bias maximum to simply arise from the anisotropy of the op but in this case , as shown in [ subsect : fs ] , a closed 3d fs has to be invoked , which is not predicted by bandstructure calculations .",

    "they all feature maxima related to a small gap , plus additional shoulders that can be related to a second , larger gap .",
    "the position of these features does not depend on the direction of current injection and this speaks in favor of isotropic gaps . in this concern , it is worth mentioning that also the relative weight of the two terms in the conductance ( let s say , @xmath311 and @xmath312 ) is the same irrespective of the direction of the current .",

    "it is clear that the latter model is unapt to reproduce the shape of the curves .",
    "the two - gap model works better in the gap region but leaves out additional structures ( indicated by arrows ) which are very clear only in curves with a large amplitude and that can be related to the strong electron - boson coupling ( see sections [ subsect : ebi ] and [ sect : ebiinfebased ] ) . incidentally , note that in curve 5 these structures are probably masked by small dips , that however do not affect the clear double - gap structures .",
    "the absence of zero - bias peaks certainly rules out , also in this case , the presence of nodes or line zeros on the fermi surface , and this is consistent with theoretical predictions @xcite . instead , these findings are not incompatible with the presence of gap minima or even zeros ( but not line zeros ) in some regions of the fermi surface , as recently proposed to explain the raman scattering data in this compound @xcite .",

    "the dashed line is the derivative of the theoretical curve shown in figure [ fig12](a ) : it reproduces very well the 20 mv - structure while the other one , though present , is hardly visible .",

    "figure [ fig12](d ) shows that the values of @xmath342 ( open symbols ) decrease on increasing temperature , and tend to zero when @xmath343 .",

    "we can not , however , exclude that the spread is also due to specific features of each system such as nesting , vicinity to magnetism etc . but also , and most probably , quality of the sample , homogeneity and disorder .     and @xmath369 values vs t@xmath344 as determined by pcar spectroscopy measurements performed by our group as well as several other groups in case of nodeless gaps .",

    "blue and red dashed lines are only guides to the eye . pcar data for smofe(as , p ) are taken from @xcite , other results published in literature are from @xcite .",
    "the data labelled `` wang et al . '' indicate the two - band s - wave fit of the spectra from ref .",

    "but , how can this trend be interpreted ?    in order to make a reliable statement in this regard , the complexity of these systems has to be carefully taken into account .",
    "because of the multiband nature of these compounds and their dominant interband pairing , a proper interpretation of the data would require a quantitative analysis ( for example within a multiband eliashberg model ) taking into account the electronic structure of each compound .",
    "however , as a first approximation , we have done numerical simulations within the three - band s-@xmath177 eliashberg theory ( with feedback effect @xcite , i.e. by including in a self - consistent way the temperature dependence of the spin fluctuation spectral function ) to see in what conditions this trend can be reproduced . to simplify the problem , we fixed some parameters to the values that allowed us to reproduce the gaps in sm-1111 compound with t@xmath344 = 52 k @xcite .",
    "these parameters are @xmath371 ( where @xmath372 is the coupling constant between bands @xmath126 and @xmath373 ) , @xmath374 and @xmath375 ( @xmath376 where @xmath377 is the density of states of band @xmath126 ) . according to @xcite",
    ", we assumed @xmath201 to vary linearly with @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath378 . for values of the critical temperature down to 30 k , the experimental values of @xmath379 can be reproduced by keeping the total coupling constant , @xmath196 , practically constant to a value of approximately 2.4 .",
    "below 30 k , to follow the experimental trend it is necessary to i ) increase @xmath196 and ii ) modify the temperature dependence of the peak energy . in standard situations ,",
    "the latter evolves with temperature according to @xmath380 $ ] @xcite ( i.e. in a bcs - like way ) where @xmath381 is the critical temperature calculated _ without _ the correction due to the feedback effect ( @xmath382 ) .",

    "a larger @xmath196 is necessary to obtain the correct @xmath13 ; but this also gives larger gaps .",
    "this result , if confirmed by using detailed electronic calculations for each compound , might indicate that below t@xmath344=30 k the coupling increases and would also have interesting implications on the temperature dependence of the spin fluctuation spectral function that , as shown in figure [ fig12](d ) and in the inset of figure [ fig13 ] , can be determined from high - quality pcar spectroscopy experiments .",
    "in the present report we have presented an overview of the ( partly ) solved and of the ( still ) debated points about superconductivity in fe - based superconductors that have been ( or can be ) addressed by means of point - contact spectroscopy .",
    "to do so , we have also introduced generalizations of the usual models for the fit of the pcar spectra , and presented some new results . here",
    ", we would like to simply summarize the main conclusions of this long discussion , and outline the possible future challenges for pcar spectroscopy in the research about fe - based superconductors .",
    "in section [ sect : models ] we have examined and discussed in detail the profound and often counterintuitive connections among the fs topology of multiband superconductors , the symmetry of the ops present on the fs sheets , the directionality of the pcar process , the strength and the spectrum of electron - boson interaction , and the resulting pcar normalized conductance curves . taking into account these connections greatly complicates the description of the ar process , but is unavoidable when dealing with fe - based superconductors .",
    "the extension of the btk model to its most general form , that we call `` full 3d btk '' model , ( sections [ subsect : fs ] and [ subsect : ebi ] ) allows directly comparing the pcar experimental results with the predictions of the theory for a _ specific shape of the fs _ , a _ specific symmetry of the op _ in every band and a _ specific spectrum of electron - boson interaction _ ( via the preliminary solution of the eliashberg equations ) .",
    "the comparison of the results to those of the simplified btk models provides some indications and warnings for the analysis of pcar data in fe - based compounds that can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) the analysis of the _ ab_-plane pcar spectra on fe - based superconductors requires at least the 2d version of the btk model , because of the quasi-2d shape of their fs and the possible presence of non - isotropic ops . even in the case of pure _ s_-wave symmetry of all the ops",
    ", this model gives results slightly different from the full 3d one ( in particular , an apparent enhancement of the @xmath56 values is observed , due to fs - shape - related geometric effects ) ;    \\2 ) in principle , _ c_-axis pcar spectra in pnictides should be analyzed only by means of the 3d btk model ( simplified version of @xcite or full version of equation 11 ) because of the non - spherical shape of the fss .",
    "however if the _",
    "ab_-plane contacts on the same material do nt show any sign of line nodes or zeros in the op , and the precise determination of the @xmath56 values is not vital , the 2d btk model can return correct information about the _ isotropic _ gap values and their temperature dependency . in this last case , as shown for the large gap in figure [ fig:4](b ) , the @xmath56-enhancement effect is remarkable especially when the fs is only slightly warped , but the gap - related peaks remain at the same energy positions ;    \\3 ) the application of the full 3d btk model to the case of _ fully anisotropic s _ ops ( with line zeros ) or _",

    "as expected , the normalized conductance of _ ab_-plane contacts in the ar regime ( @xmath387 ) shows characteristic zero - bias maxima or peaks , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , in the presence of a small lifetime broadening the smoothed spectra become very similar , preventing the possibility to discriminate between the two symmetries . in the same conditions , _",
    "c_-axis contacts unexpectedly show no signs of zero - bias peaks or maxima even for @xmath42 because of the geometric @xmath56-enhancement effect , as shown in figure [ fig:4 ] .",
    "this prediction could be verified by means of _ directional _ pcar experiments on high - quality single crystals . in other words ,",
    "the observation of zero - bias peaks or maxima in _ c_-axis contacts can be reconciled with the previous two op symmetries only if the corresponding fs sheet is 3d , thus giving to directional pcar spectroscopy the capability to attain indirect information on the shape of the fs ;    \\4 ) the introduction of energy - dependent gap functions @xmath181 ( determined by the proper solution of multiband eliashberg equations ) into the btk expressions leads to the conclusion that structures due to the electron - boson interaction ( ebi ) are certainly visible in the ar conductance at energies higher than the large gap ( and for coupling constants compatible with the @xmath13 and the gap values ) _ provided that _",
    "the spectral function of this interaction is sufficiently peaked ( e.g. has a lorentzian shape ) . the use of the spectral function typical of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( afsf ) results in curves with no ebi structures unless unphysical , very low cutoff energies are chosen .",
    "serious questions thus arise on the true shape of the bosonic spectrum since ( as shown in two particular cases in section [ sect : ebiinfebased ] ) ebi structures have actually been observed in the pcar data of various compounds .    as for the op symmetry in fe - based superconductors ,",
    "the analysis and comparison of various pcar results reported in section [ sect : pcar ] show that , despite the rather common opinion that pcar results are contradictory , the most recent and reliable experiments are in fairly good agreement with one another .",
    "in particular :    \\1 ) when data from various groups are available for a given compound , they generally give similar results if analyzed in a homogeneous way .",
    "the apparent conflicts are mostly due to a different normalization of the raw data or to a different interpretation of the common structures present in the conductance .",
    "\\2 ) in optimally doped and slightly underdoped 1111 compounds , if the pcar curves are normalized to the relevant normal - state spectrum and the high - energy structures are not artificially reduced , all the data point to the presence of ( at least ) two isotropic gaps ( with no nodes and no line zeros ) with ratios @xmath388 lower and sensibly higher than the bcs value , respectively .",
    "\\3 ) similar observations apply to the 122 compounds where data of various groups concur in supporting a multi - gap @xmath11 picture ( though at most two gaps can be resolved by pcar spectroscopy ) .",
    "since in this case most of the experiments are made on single crystals , a dependency of the `` weight '' of every band on the direction of current injection is also observed , in agreement with the predictions of subsection [ subsect : fs ] .",
    "\\4 ) in compounds of the 22426 family and in co - doped ca-122 ( as shown here for the first time ) pcar spectroscopy gives some evidence of a _",
    "d_-wave or a _ fully anisotropic s_-wave op . in these cases , experiments along different crystallographic directions can be used as a `` test '' of the predictions of [ subsect : fs ] or of the presence of a 3d fs sheet .    in section [",
    "sect : ebiinfebased ] we have given evidence of ebi structures in the pcar spectra of co - doped ba-122 and sm-1111 . by properly combining the direct solution of the three - band @xmath11 eliashberg equations and the btk models we were able to reproduce these structures in amplitude and position , thus obtaining important information on the characteristic energy of the bosonic spectrum and its temperature dependency .",
    "this energy turns out to coincide with the characteristic energy of the spectrum of spin fluctuations measured by inelastic neutron scattering thus giving a _ strong support _ to the sf origin of the coupling in these compounds .",
    "in addition these ebi - related structures ( not only small peaks or shoulders at the proper energy but also a general increase of the conductance at high bias ) can nicely explain some frequently observed anomalies of pcar spectra that can not be reproduced by the btk models using constant gaps .",
    "this is another example that too simplified models can not explain the rather complex physics of ar in fe - based superconductors .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : puzzle ] we have shown  by comparing the results of various experiments of different groups  that at the decrease of the @xmath13 of the sample the ratios @xmath388 for the small and the large gap have an anomalous behavior",
    ". instead of merging at a value close to bcs one at the lowering of @xmath13 , as naively expected in the framework of a multiband model dominated by interband couplings , they both increase at @xmath389 k reaching values greater than 5 and 10 , respectively . a preliminary analysis of this `` strange '' behavior in the framework of the eliashberg theory including feedback effect @xcite shows that it can be explained only supposing that below @xmath390 k the temperature dependency of the characteristic boson energy is no more bcs - like but becomes more linear and , at the same time , the total coupling strength increases .",
    "both these conclusions could be further investigated by directional pcar experiments in low-@xmath13 high - quality single crystals .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that pcar spectroscopy can provide information on some debated properties of the fe - based superconductors if the pcar spectra are analyzed within suitably generalized models .",
    "in particular , a tighter relationship between the electronic properties ( and thus the geometry of the fermi surface ) and the pcar results can be established .",
    "this could help either verifying the plausibility of calculated fermi surfaces , or providing some experimental hints about what the fs should look like to explain the measured spectra .",
    "a systematic pcar study of some selected systems as a function of doping , coupled to bandstructure and fs calculations as well as with the determination of fine lattice details , could help testing the proposed connection between these aspects and the symmetry of the order parameter , and to verify to what extent the scaling law of the gap ratios @xmath391 as a function of @xmath13 is universal in these compounds ( and , if so , what are its physical reasons and implications ) . as for the origin of the coupling mechanism ,",
    "important hints can be obtained by extracting the typical boson energy from pcar spectra and comparing it with the energy of spin resonance as measured , for instance , by neutron scattering experiment . in general , thus , the future developments of the research about fe - based compounds pose a challenge to pcar spectroscopy , and might strongly benefit from the results of this experimental technique .",

    "<S> point - contact andreev reflection spectroscopy ( pcar ) has proven to be one of the most powerful tools in the investigation of superconductors , where it provides information on the order parameter ( op ) , a fundamental property of the superconducting state . in the past 20 years </S>",
    "<S> , successive improvements of the models used to analyze the spectra have continuously extended its capabilities , making it suited to study new superconductors with `` exotic '' properties such as anisotropic , nodal and multiple ops . in fe - based superconductors , the complex compound- and doping - dependent fermi surface and the predicted sensitivity of the op to fine structural details present unprecedent challenges for this technique . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we show here that pcar measurements in fe - based superconductors carried out so far have already greatly contributed to our understanding of these materials , despite some apparent inconsistencies that can be overcome if a homogeneous treatment of the data is used . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that , if properly extended theoretical models for andreev reflection are used , directional pcar spectroscopy can provide detailed information not only on the amplitude and symmetry of the ops , but also on the nature of the pairing boson , and even give some hints about the shape of the fermi surface . </S>"
