    "there is a growing interest in transitions over energy barriers in field theories at finite temperature .",
    "the motivation comes from high - energy physics and cosmology ( _ e.g. , _ baryon - number violating sphaleron transitions in electroweak theory@xcite-@xcite ) , as well as from condensed - matter physics ( _ e.g. , _ current - reducing fluctuations in one - dimensional superconductors@xcite ) .",
    "such thermally induced transitions usually involve collective excitations like kink - antikink pairs or sphalerons , and therefore occur in a nonlinear setting .",
    "the nonlinearity , in turn , often renders analytic techniques useless , forcing one to resort to numerical ( lattice ) methods . on the other hand",
    ", many questions of interest can be answered by considering the classical regime in which the temperature is much larger than the energies of the field quanta at the scale of a relevant collective excitation@xcite .",
    "a fundamental quantity of interest is the corresponding transition rate . unlike static observables ,",
    "it can not be determined from a given canonical ensemble of field configurations .",
    "instead , one must follow a real - time evolution of the field - theoretic system in the heat bath .",
    "obviously , the rate would depend on the properties of the heat bath and its coupling to the system .",
    "this was indeed confirmed by recent numerical studies@xcite @xcite , in which the heat bath was implemented through langevin equation . in",
    "most naturally occurring situations a system interacts with its environment through the boundaries , and the environment is an infinite extension of the system itself .",
    "this consideration dictates our choice of a heat bath in this work .",
    "ideally , the heat bath we model should possess two main properties : ( _ a _ ) waves traveling through the boundary out of the system should be completely absorbed , as if there were no boundary and the system had an infinite extension ; and ( _ b _ ) the waves traveling into the system should be thermally distributed .",
    "our construction of a heat bath ensures these two properties in the free - field case , while for an interacting field they hold in the linear approximation .",
    "the similarity between our linearized heat bath and the true extension of the interacting system becomes better with decreasing temperature .",
    "note that the standard langevin dynamics , imposed either in the bulk of the system or at the boundary@xcite , will not lead to the properties _ a _ and _",
    "b_.    while the idea of mimicking a natural heat bath is very generally applicable , we restrict ourselves in this article to the case of a scalar field in one spatial dimension . in section ii we derive the boundary force exerted by the heat bath on this one - dimensional system .",
    "next , we show in section iii how our construction of the realistic heat bath can be implemented numerically . as an example , in section iv we apply our technique to study kink - antikink pair nucleation in @xmath0 theory , a subject that has been extensively investigated by other methods@xcite-@xcite .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section v.",
    "consider a lattice system consisting of a ( possibly self - interacting ) scalar field @xmath1 , with a minimum of its potential @xmath2 at @xmath3 and mass @xmath4 corresponding to that minimum . for definiteness ,",
    "let it reside on the @xmath5 sites of a one - dimensional chain , and be coupled to a heat bath at @xmath6 .",
    "let the heat bath be a free massive scalar field system on the positive @xmath7 sites with equation of motion ( the lattice spacing is @xmath8 ) @xmath9 for @xmath10 and boundary condition @xmath11 given the solution @xmath12 , there will be a reaction force exerted by the heat bath on the system : @xmath13 the @xmath14 contribution to @xmath15 is a harmonic force .",
    "the @xmath16 contribution , called @xmath17 ( the memory force ) in the following , is , as we shall see immediately , a response of a more general nature .",
    "as the heat bath is a free field system , this response should be linear .",
    "furthermore , it should causally depend on @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , there exists a response function @xmath19 @xmath20 such that @xmath21 in order to determine @xmath19 let us take @xmath22 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "[ eom ] that @xmath23 , with @xmath24 using eq .",
    "[ reac ] we then find that @xmath19 should satisfy @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the laplace transform .",
    "it follows that @xmath27 the integral in eq .",
    "[ response ] is most easily computed in fourier space .",
    "we define @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where we are free to take any extension of @xmath19 for @xmath30 .",
    "then it follows from the convolution theorem that @xmath31 for numerical purposes it is best to extend @xmath19 to @xmath30 such that @xmath32 vanishes outside a finite interval . to this end we choose @xmath33 , so @xmath32 becomes purely imaginary ( essentially the sine transform ) .",
    "the latter can be obtained immediately from the laplace transform ( eq .  [ laplacepsi ] ) by the @xmath34 rotation of @xmath35 in the complex plane ; taking the imaginary part then gives @xmath36 for frequencies @xmath37 corresponding to propagating modes and @xmath38 outside this range .",
    "we expect the heat bath response to be finite for any bounded @xmath18 ( eq .  [ response ] ) .",
    "if so , @xmath19 must decay sufficiently rapidly in the distant future .",
    "this indeed is the case : using eq .",
    "[ tildechi ] and performing the inverse fourier transform we find in the saddle - point approximation @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",
    "the dissipation by the heat bath can equivalently be described by a linear response to the momentum @xmath41 at the boundary , rather than the field .",
    "explicitly , it follows from eq .",
    "[ response ] that @xmath42 where @xmath43 or , equivalently , @xmath44 , so that @xmath45    we now turn to the second contribution to the boundary force , the random force @xmath46 .",
    "it is a gaussian random variable whose properties are defined by its time autocorrelation @xmath47 .",
    "these are most easily determined through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , stating @xmath48 ( @xmath49 denotes the temperature ) .",
    "numerical implementation of @xmath46 amounts to generating gaussian noise with this autocorrelation function .",
    "one can check explicitly that the time correlation function of the total boundary force @xmath50 is equal to the average of @xmath51 for a canonical ensemble , calculated for an infinitely extended free field .",
    "this is to be expected , as @xmath52 represents the force between neighboring sites .",
    "we conclude this section by discussing the continuum limit of the heat bath response .",
    "obviously , @xmath15 diverges as @xmath53 .",
    "instead , @xmath54 is a well - behaved quantity whose limit is simply @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the continuum spatial coordinate . in other words ,",
    "if we prescribe the boundary field motion , the heat bath response will determine the boundary field spatial derivative in such a way that the waves traveling out of the system will not be reflected at the boundary .",
    "the corresponding response function is found following steps analogous to eq .",
    "[ response]eq .",
    "[ laplacepsi ] .",
    "we write down the continuum equations of motion @xmath57 together with the boundary condition @xmath58 and require @xmath59 taking @xmath60 then yields @xmath61 , or @xmath62 .",
    "it is an easy exercise to verify that the same result is obtained by first computing the response function for the lattice boundary field derivative and then taking the limit @xmath53 .",
    "our numerical implementation of the boundary force is as follows .",
    "the memory force @xmath63 is computed using eq .",
    "[ fmem ] , that is , in fourier space . the function @xmath32 is given by eq .  [ tildechi ] . in practice , the integral eq .",
    "[ fmem ] is replaced by a finite sum over discrete values of @xmath64 , separated by an increment @xmath65 . as a result ,",
    "the response function @xmath19 becomes periodic in @xmath66 with a period @xmath67 . beyond @xmath68",
    "our approximation of @xmath19 is incorrect , and the lower limit of integration in eq .",
    "[ response ] should be cut off .",
    "we achieve this by changing the definition of @xmath69 to @xmath70 where @xmath71 . at the same time",
    ", @xmath72 should be large enough so the discarded part of the integral eq .",
    "[ fmem ] is negligible . with the new definition",
    ", @xmath73 satisfies the equation of motion @xmath74    the random force @xmath46 is computed by convolving white noise of unit power spectrum with a function @xmath75 whose fourier image is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the fourier transform of @xmath78 given by eq .",
    "[ ct ] @xcite .",
    "this can be done very efficiently using fft algorithms .    with both ingredients of the boundary force in place",
    ", we can now write down and integrate the equations of motion for the one - dimensional system immersed in the heat bath .",
    "these equations have the standard form @xmath79 in the bulk of the system , but should be modified at the boundaries .",
    "for example , at the left boundary we have @xmath80 and the right - boundary analog is obvious .",
    "the system of equations of motion for the field is supplemented by eq .",
    "[ updateft ] governing the evolution of the memory forces at both boundaries .",
    "we integrate equations [ eq : eqmo_bulk ] , [ eq : eqmo_bound ] , and [ updateft ] using the second - order runge - kutta algorithm . while this way of updating @xmath69 is efficient compared to computation of the full integral eq .",
    "[ ftomega ] , it is not accurate enough to maintain correct phases of @xmath69 for times much longer than @xmath67 . to ensure stability , we therefore adjust the values of @xmath69 by computing eq .",
    "[ ftomega ] every @xmath72 time units .",
    "we have tested the action of @xmath17 by evolving an initially hot system with @xmath46 omitted .",
    "this corresponds to cooling in the zero - temperature heat bath .",
    "the resulting evolution is very similar to that of a benchmark run where we substitute for the heat bath a real cold free - field system with large volume .",
    "this similarity holds separately for every momentum mode .",
    "the method allows cooling the system to at least @xmath81 times its original temperature . cooling curves for a system with a real and with a simulated heat bath are shown in figure [ coolcomp ] .",
    "we then turned @xmath46 on and tested it by heating a cold field configuration to a prescribed temperature .",
    "again it compared well , mode by mode , with a benchmark run , in which we coupled a cold system to a large real heat bath whose temperature the system eventually reached ( let us stress that using the real heat bath is much more costly in terms of cpu time ) .",
    "both heating curves are shown in figure [ heatcomp ] .",
    "finally , we have shown numerically the self - consistency of our method by comparing the motion of the endpoint field to that in the middle of the system @xcite .",
    "as figure [ endvsmid ] shows , the autocorrelation curves of the two fields are very close to each other , meaning that the simulated free - field heat bath closely approximates the real one .",
    "we have applied our method to investigate kink - antikink dynamics of @xmath0 theory whose lagrangian is @xmath82 in suitably chosen units@xcite .",
    "kinks and antikinks are finite - energy solutions of the equations of motion interpolating between the vacuum values of the field @xmath83",
    ". explicit functional form of the static kink is @xmath84 .",
    "the spatial extension of a kink is approximately @xmath85 , and the kink mass is @xmath86 .    following @xcite , we chose a system of @xmath87 sites with lattice spacing @xmath88 .",
    "the simulations were performed at seven values of inverse temperature @xmath89 between 3.0 and 6.0 .",
    "our runge - kutta time step was 0.005 . for each value of the temperature we started from an ordered system and warmed it up for 2500 time units followed by @xmath90 time units over which we measured the number of kinks @xmath7 .",
    "for the latter we used the same definition as in @xcite : the number of zeros in a field configuration smoothened over the physical distance of @xmath91 .",
    "the average kink number @xmath92 at a given temperature should not depend on the properties of a heat bath .",
    "our measurements of this observable , shown in figure [ kinkno_vs_beta ] , are indeed close to those of @xcite .",
    "note , however , that our measurement errors are much larger , especially for low temperatures , even though our data sample is as big as in @xcite .",
    "we estimated the errors using a jackknife method with the block size varying over a very long range ; we are therefore confident that the autocorrelation of our data is properly taken into account .",
    "moreover , we studied a microcanonical evolution of our system at the energy roughly corresponding to @xmath93 , with the error estimate similar to that of the corresponding canonical case .    the temperature dependence of @xmath94 may be interpreted in terms of the effective kink mass .",
    "namely , one expects@xcite @xmath95 it was found in earlier work that @xmath96 .",
    "it was also indicated that @xmath97 is temperature dependent@xcite,@xcite .",
    "both features find further evidence in our study . if we try to fit all our measurements of @xmath92 to eq .",
    "[ eq : meff ] at once , an unacceptably low goodness - of - fit results .",
    "the situation improves dramatically if we exclude the highest - temperature point from the fit .",
    "we then find @xmath98 , or @xmath99 , in good agreement with @xcite . alternatively",
    ", we can use pairs of consecutive values of @xmath92 to extract @xmath97 .",
    "the result , presented in figure [ meff2p ] , shows the tendency of @xmath97 to decrease at higher temperatures , in agreement with findings of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another interesting quantity we extract from the kink - antikink number time history is a kink lifetime , _",
    "i.e. _  the autocorrelation time @xmath100 of @xmath7 .",
    "the latter is usually obtained by fitting the @xmath7 autocorrelation function @xmath101 to a single exponential of the form @xmath102 .",
    "if the time history exhibits more than one time scale ( as is the case for @xmath7 ) , @xmath100 can only be given an average , or effective meaning .",
    "the existence of such multiple scales also makes a single - exponential fit to the autocorrelation function extremely difficult .",
    "a multiexponential fit to noisy data is not a practical possibility .",
    "we use an alternative way of determining @xmath100 , closely related to the integral definition of the autocorrelation time .",
    "namely , if @xmath103 is a time interval between two consecutive measurements of @xmath7 , we expect @xmath104.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , for large @xmath105 @xmath106 approaches a random - walk behavior . for a given @xmath105",
    "we determine @xmath106 from our data set and solve eq .",
    "[ deftau ] for @xmath100 . for @xmath107",
    "the result is approximately independent of @xmath105 , and we take it as an estimate of the kink lifetime .",
    "a typical dependence of @xmath100 on @xmath66 is shown in figure [ tau_vs_lag ] .",
    "note that large values of @xmath66 for which the plateau is reached indicate the existence of multiple time scales in the kink - antikink number fluctuations .",
    "unlike the exponential fit , this method also allows a well - defined error - estimating procedure for @xmath100 .",
    "in particular , we apply the jackknife technique .",
    "note that the lag values @xmath66 used to determine @xmath100 are of the order of 5000 .",
    "this is to be compared to our @xmath7 time history length of @xmath90 .",
    "we therefore only have a small effective number of independent measurements of @xmath100 , and our error estimate can not be very accurate .",
    "conservatively we can expect the errors of @xmath100 to be correct within a factor of 2 .",
    "this might explain their inhomogeneous dependence on the temperature .",
    "kink - antikink pair nucleation can be viewed as a multidimensional analog of a particle escape over a barrier@xcite,@xcite , with the kink lifetime related to to the effective barrier height @xmath108@xcite : @xmath109 where @xmath110 . from our data",
    "( figure [ tau_vs_beta ] ) we find @xmath111 , slightly higher than @xmath112 of @xcite , obtained by solving a low - viscosity langevin equation .",
    "both that value and ours are inconsistent with the naively expected @xmath113 .",
    "more work is required to explain this discrepancy@xcite .",
    "more importantly , however , our results show no exponential suppression of the kink - antikink pairs nucleation rate with growing temperature , in agreement with analytical predictions and earlier numerical work@xcite-@xcite .",
    "in this article we presented a method of modeling naturally occurring heat baths .",
    "while our presentation concentrated on a scalar field in one spatial dimension , the principles underlying our construction of a heat bath do not depend on the dimensionality or the field content of a theory in question . in any case",
    ", one can determine the memory force exerted by a heat bath by studying the linear response of the latter to the field motion at the system boundary .",
    "the corresponding random component of the force may then be found using fluctuation - dissipation theorem . the only new feature to appear in dimensions higher than one",
    "is related to the connectedness of the boundary : the field motion at different points of the boundary will be correlated in a way consistent with causality .",
    "this is , however , a technical difficulty , not a conceptual one .",
    "the work on extending our method to other systems is currently in progress .",
    "we have verified numerically that our simulated heat bath thermalizes correctly both linear and nonlinear systems . as an application",
    ", we considered the dynamics of kink - antikink pairs in @xmath0 theory .",
    "our measurements of the kink density agree well with those obtained by solving langevin equation , as one would expect for an equilibrium quantity independent of a heat bath implementation .",
    "the kink lifetimes we measure are close to those following from the low - viscosity langevin dynamics .",
    "this is again to be expected for sufficiently large systems : as the system size grows , the influence of the boundary heat bath on the dynamics decreases .",
    "the langevin analog would then be decreasing viscosity .    to conclude , we emphasize again an important advantage of our simulated heat bath over the langevin method ( including its zero - viscosity microcanonical limit ) : our heat bath is not arbitrarily chosen and involves no free parameters like viscosity .",
    "rather , it is , to the best of our knowledge , the closest known approximation to a natural situation , in which open systems are immersed in a similar environment . the only physical ( not numerical ) approximation we make is linearization : our heat bath exchanges linear excitations ( plane waves , or mesons ) with the system , but not nonlinear ones ( kinks , or baryons ) .",
    "since we are only interested in pair creation and annihilation processes , the exchange of topological charge with the environment should have little impact on our results .",
    "it follows that we can approximately ( the only approximation being linearization of the heat bath ) identify our simulation time with the real physical one .",
    "the transition rates we measure have therefore direct physical meaning .",
