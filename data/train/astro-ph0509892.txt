    "a broad range of interesting phenomena in science and engineering occur in a low mach number regime in which the fluid velocity is much less than the speed of sound .",
    "several low mach number schemes have been developed to exploit this separation of scales ; these models capture the fluid dynamics of interest without the need to resolve acoustic wave propagation .",
    "physically , one can think of the solution to a low mach number model as supporting infinitely fast acoustic equilibration rather than finite - velocity acoustic wave propagation .",
    "mathematically , this is manifest in the addition of a constraint on the velocity field to the system of evolution equations .",
    "this velocity constraint can be translated into an elliptic equation for pressure that expresses the equilibration process .",
    "because explicit discretization schemes for the low mach number system are limited by the fluid velocity and not by the sound speed , they often gain several orders of magnitude in computational efficiency over the traditional compressible approach .",
    "the simplest low mach number model is expressed by the incompressible navier - stokes equations for a constant density fluid .",
    "generalizations that incorporate variations in density include the boussinesq approximation  @xcite , which allows heating - induced buoyancy in a constant density background , and the anelastic atmospheric  @xcite and stellar  @xcite approximations that include the effect of large - scale background stratification in the fluid density and pressure but assume small thermodynamic perturbations from the background .",
    "low mach number models for chemical combustion  @xcite and nuclear burning  @xcite incorporate large compressibility effects due to chemical / nuclear reactions and thermal processes with a spatially constant background pressure",
    ".    low mach number models to date have , with one exception , allowed either zero volumetric changes ( incompressible navier - stokes , boussinesq ) or changes due only to local heating effects ( low - speed combustion , nuclear burning ) , or to large - scale background stratification ( anelastic ) . the only low mach number model that incorporates both finite local expansion due to heating and volume changes due to background stratification is the pseudo - incompressible equation set for the terrestrial atmosphere , introduced by @xcite and rigorously derived using low mach number asymptotics by  @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the pseudo - incompressible constraint assumes the ideal gas equation of state , which results in a simplification of terms that does not hold for more general equations of state and non - trivial changes in composition .",
    "our anticipated application for this model is the convective , ignition , and early propagation phases of type  ia supernovae , but the model should be applicable to many other problems , such as type  i x - ray bursts ( see , e.g. , recent work by @xcite for an alternate form of the low mach number approach for type  i x - ray bursts ) , classical novae , and ordinary convection in stars . events such as type  ia supernovae are characterized by a large range in length scales , from the @xmath0 to @xmath1  cm scale of the flame to the @xmath2  cm scale of the white dwarf .",
    "the range in timescales is equally impressive , from the 100  years of convection that precedes ignition to the one second duration of the explosion .",
    "presently , most large - scale calculations focus on the explosion itself , beginning with several seeded hot spots to begin the runaway . in the last minutes of the convective phase , velocities reach @xmath3 of the sound speed @xcite , with temperature fluctuations of at most 5% @xcite .",
    "these speeds are too slow for compressible codes to accurately follow .",
    "for this reason , simulation of the convective and ignition phases has seen only limited numerical work , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "recent analytic work @xcite suggests that full star simulations are needed to accurately capture the convective flows and yield the spatial , temporal , and size distribution of the hot spots that seed the explosion .",
    "three - dimensional anelastic calculations @xcite have shown that a dipole velocity field dominates the convection .",
    "the low mach number model presented here , like the anelastic model , will be capable of the long time integration necessary to follow the convection .",
    "unlike the anelastic model , however , the low mach number approach continues to be valid as the variation in density and temperature increases in the flame bubbles that evolve in the early phases of the explosion . following the evolution from the convection through the early phases of",
    "the explosion is the eventual target of our low mach number methodology .    although the derivation of the low mach number equation set will be general , the example we will consider is a simplified problem without reactions or thermal conduction , and with a time - independent radially symmetric form of self - gravity .",
    "the focus of the examples is to demonstrate the ability of the low mach number model to accurately represent the hydrodynamics .",
    "we will compare the simulations based on the low mach number approach to simulations based on the fully compressible equation set , where applicable , and to the traditional anelastic approach , where it is applicable .",
    "we will show that the low mach number algorithm works well for very low mach number flows , with validation presented up to mach numbers @xmath4 .",
    "in the next section we derive the low mach number equations , and in section  [ sec : numer ] we discuss the numerical implementation . section  [ sec : compare ] contains numerical comparisons with compressible and anelastic simulations , and in the final section we discuss our conclusions and future work .",
    "we begin with the fully compressible equations governing motion in the stellar environment as described , for example , in  @xcite @xmath5 here @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the density , velocity , temperature and pressure , respectively , and @xmath10 is the total energy with @xmath11 representing the internal energy . in addition , @xmath12 is the abundance of the @xmath13th isotope , with associated production rate , @xmath14 , and energy release , @xmath15 . finally , @xmath16 is the radially dependent gravitational acceleration ( resulting from spherically symmetric self - gravity ) , @xmath17 is the unit vector in the radial direction , and @xmath18 is the thermal conductivity .",
    "the reynolds number of flows in a typical white dwarf is sufficiently large that we neglect viscosity here , though viscous terms could easily be included in the model and the numerical methodology . for the stellar conditions being considered the pressure contains contributions from ions , radiation , and electrons .",
    "thus @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the contribution to the thermodynamic pressure due to fermions . in these expressions",
    "@xmath22 is the mass of the proton , @xmath23 is related to the stefan - boltzmann constant @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the speed of light , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the atomic number of the @xmath13th isotope , and @xmath28 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the ionic component has the form associated with an ideal gas but the radiation and electron pressure components do not .",
    "we use a stellar equation of state as implemented in  @xcite .    as a prelude to developing the low mach number equations , we first rewrite the energy equation ( eq .  [ [ energy_eq_full ] ] ) in terms of the enthalpy , @xmath29 , @xmath30 where we introduce @xmath31 to represent the enthalpy source terms .    our goal in this section is to derive a model for low speed flows in a hydrostatically balanced , radially stratified , background that removes acoustic waves",
    "yet allows for the development of finite amplitude temperature and density variations .",
    "we thus posit the existence of a background state with pressure , density and temperature @xmath32 and @xmath33 satisfying both the equation of state and hydrostatic equilibrium . because we will neglect reaction terms that could potentially alter the large - scale pressure distribution within the star , for the purposes of this paper we will neglect time variation of the background state , i.e.",
    ", we will assume @xmath34 .    in order to understand the behavior of the system",
    ", we examine the balance of terms as a function of mach number , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the speed of sound ) , which will be assumed to be small .",
    "we re - write the momentum equation in nondimensional coordinates , where the space and time coordinates as well as the density , velocity and pressure , are scaled by characteristic values @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively",
    ". for the problem scale of interest @xmath40 is a typical advective velocity , @xmath37 a typical length scale , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a characteristic value of @xmath36 .",
    "we define a scaling for @xmath44 in terms of the pressure scale height , @xmath45    the momentum equation in nondimensional coordinates ( @xmath46 , etc . ) , and exploiting hydrostatic equilibrium of the reference state , has the form @xmath47 for the large - scale near - equilibrium behavior , we set @xmath48 , getting @xmath49 where @xmath50    since all nondimensional terms are @xmath51 it is clear that to maintain a long - term balance , both @xmath52 and @xmath53 must be @xmath54 this is consistent with the traditional anelastic approximation ; once the density perturbation is assumed small the approximation @xmath55 follows from the continuity equation , and a linearized temperature - density relationship can be used to replace the buoyancy term in the momentum equation by one dependent on temperature ( or entropy ) rather than density .    here",
    ", however , we are interested in finite amplitude density perturbations . in this case",
    ", it is possible for the model to breakdown in long time integrations should the flow accelerate to the point that @xmath56 is no longer small .",
    "we would , nevertheless , expect the low mach number model to remain valid for a limited period of time .",
    "the behavior of the model for finite time intervals can be examined by considering a shorter time scale , @xmath57 , defined such that on this time scale the buoyancy forcing from finite amplitude density perturbations can accelerate the flow to at most @xmath58 then , recalling @xmath41 , we see that @xmath59 recalling then that @xmath60 and @xmath42 , we see that @xmath61 in this case the nondimensional momentum equation has the form @xmath62 which is consistent with the low mach number nuclear burning model used in  @xcite . the assumption that @xmath57 is in fact unnecessarily restrictive ; in a realistic physical scenario , even in the case of locally large density variations , the fluid accelerates with acceleration @xmath63 and the relevant time scale would in fact be @xmath64 i.e. , the model is valid as the fluid accelerates , until the mach number of the flow is no longer small . in other words , the assumption of small mach number is sufficient to guarantee validity of the model .",
    "we note two important features of the model thus far .",
    "the first is that in both cases the perturbational pressure , which we will now denote as @xmath65 satisfies @xmath66 thus in all but the momentum equation ( where the @xmath67 scaling requires the presence of @xmath68 ) , we can substitute @xmath69 for @xmath9 .",
    "it is this approximation that decouples the pressure from the density in such a way as to filter acoustic waves from the solution .",
    "the second important feature is that the momentum equation can be retained in its original form , @xmath70 with no approximation to the buoyancy term and no assumption on the size of the perturbational density , as long as the actual acceleration of the flow is such that mach number of the flow remains small .",
    "we now consider the implications of replacing @xmath9 by @xmath69 .",
    "the evolution of the non - reacting low mach number system is described by the mass and momentum equations in combination with the enthalpy equation , but the system remains constrained by the equation of state ( eq .  [ [ eq : eos ] ] ) , namely , @xmath71 . to complete the low mach number model we re -",
    "pose the equation of state as a constraint on the velocity field , following closely the derivation in @xcite but retaining stratification effects .",
    "we begin by re - writing conservation of mass as an expression for the divergence of velocity : @xmath72 differentiating the equation of state ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : eos ] ] ) along particle paths , we can write @xmath73 or @xmath74 with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "we now require an expression for @xmath78 , which can be found by differentiating the enthalpy equation ( eq .  [ [ enthalpy_eq ] ] ) : @xmath79 or , gathering terms , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 for convenience .",
    "substituting equation  ( [ eq : dtdt ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : drdt ] ) and the resulting expression into equation  ( [ eq : divu ] ) yields @xmath84 then , replacing @xmath9 by @xmath85 , @xmath86 becomes @xmath87 , and , recalling the definition of @xmath31 , the divergence constraint can be written @xmath88 where we define @xmath89 we note that for domains sufficiently smaller than a pressure scale height where @xmath90 can be neglected , equation  ( [ eq : full_divu_constraint ] ) reduces exactly to the divergence constraint , equation ( 5 ) in @xcite .",
    "for the larger domains that are the target of this paper , we use the thermodynamic identities as outlined in appendix  [ sec : alpha ] , to write @xmath91 where @xmath92 , and we have substituted @xmath69 for @xmath9 .    in the case of terrestrial atmospheres and in the absence of compositional effects , @xmath93 is replaced by the constant @xmath94 , and using @xmath95 with @xmath96 the gas constant , this expression can be simplified to @xmath97 the pseudo - incompressible constraint as derived by @xcite .    for stellar atmospheres the variation in @xmath93",
    "can be decomposed into two contributing factors : the background stratification and the local perturbation to that base state .",
    "for a nearly isentropically stratified base state and small perturbations to the base state , @xmath93 is close to constant , hence @xmath98 . neglecting expansion effects from thermal diffusion or reactions , this then reduces to the traditional anelastic approximation , @xmath99    for the more general case @xmath100 is not constant , but we can exploit the fact that both @xmath69 and @xmath101 are functions only of @xmath102 .",
    "it is straightforward ( see appendix  [ sec : beta ] ) to show that in this case the constraint can be written @xmath103 where @xmath104    for the types of problems amenable to the low mach number model , the density and temperature perturbations may be large , but even so the variation of @xmath93 due to the perturbation is at most a few percent . for the examples in this paper we will neglect the local variation of @xmath105",
    "this assumption will be re - examined in subsequent work .    for the purposes of comparing the fundamental hydrodynamic behavior of the low mach number model relative to established compressible and anelastic formulations , we will for the remainder of this paper neglect the effects of variation in composition , reactions , and thermal conduction . summarizing the low mach number equation set for this specialized case and re - writing the momentum equation as an evolution equation for velocity instead , we now have @xmath106 we note that this system contains three equations for three unknowns : density , velocity and pressure .",
    "the equation of state was used to derive the constraint thus to include it here would be redundant . when reactions and compositional effects are included in future work , the evolution equations for species and energy ( in the form of temperature , entropy or enthalpy ) will be added to this system , but for the simple hydrodynamical tests we present here this system is sufficient .",
    "we discretize the low mach number equation set derived in the previous section using an extension of the second - order accurate projection methodology developed for incompressible flows @xcite , and extended to low mach number combustion @xcite and to small - scale reacting flow for sne ia @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the above references for numerical examples demonstrating the second - order accuracy of the overall methodology , as well as for many of the details of projection methods . here",
    "we present a brief overview of the numerical methodology as applied to this equation set .",
    "the absence of reactions and presence of @xmath107 in the projection steps are the key differences relative to the algorithm in @xcite .    in the projection approximation , explicit discretizations of the evolution equations",
    "are first used to approximate the velocity and thermodynamic variables at the new time , then an elliptic equation for pressure , derived from the constraint imposed on the new - time velocity , is solved to update the pressure and return the velocity field to the constraint surface .",
    "by contrast with the traditional anelastic approach , we have not replaced conservation of mass by the divergence constraint , which means we are able to evolve the density field with a conservative update , rather than invoking the equation of state to diagnose it .",
    "thus the variables we update in each advection step are the velocity , density , and either temperature , enthalpy , or entropy .",
    "the low mach number constraint constrains the evolution of the thermodynamic variables to the manifold defined by the equation of state .",
    "the discretization of the evolution equations is essentially a three - step process .",
    "first , we use an unsplit second - order godunov procedure @xcite to predict a time - centered ( @xmath108 ) edge - based advection velocity , @xmath109 , using the cell - centered data at @xmath110 and the lagged pressure gradient from the interval centered at @xmath111 .",
    "the provisional field , @xmath109 , represents a normal velocity on cell edges analogous to a mac - type staggered grid discretization of the navier - stokes equations @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : mac ] illustrates the mac grid .",
    "however , @xmath109 fails to satisfy the time - centered divergence constraint ( eq .  [ [ constraint_eq ] ] ) .",
    "we apply a discrete projection by solving the elliptic equation @xmath112 for @xmath113 , where @xmath114 represents a centered approximation to a cell - based divergence from edge - based velocities , and @xmath115 represents a centered approximation to edge - based gradients from cell - centered data .",
    "the solution , @xmath113 , is then used to define @xmath116 @xmath117 is a second - order accurate , staggered - grid vector field at @xmath118 that discretely satisfies the constraint ( eq .  [ [ constraint_eq ] ] ) , and is used for computing the time - explicit advective derivatives for @xmath119 and @xmath6 .",
    "we next explicitly update the density using a second - order accurate discretization of the mass equation .",

    "we compare and contrast the low mach number results with those obtained using two different discretizations of the fully compressible equation set , both implemented in the flash code  @xcite .",
    "the first is the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm )  @xcite , which is a high - order accurate , dimensionally split algorithm where the updates are done in one - dimensional sweeps , e.g. in two dimensions @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the state variable , @xmath141 is the operator that updates the state through @xmath142 in time in the horizontal direction , and @xmath143 updates the state by @xmath142 in the vertical direction .",
    "one ppm cycle updates the state through @xmath144 , switching the order of the directional operators midway through to retain second - order accuracy .",
    "ppm is the primary hydrodynamics algorithm used by the large - scale sne  ia explosion modeling community  @xcite .",
    "the flash implementation of ppm has been well validated @xcite , and serves as a good basis for comparisons with the low mach number algorithm .    a numerical issue that arises in fully compressible simulations , but not with the low mach number approach , is the difficulty of maintaining a quiet hydrostatic atmosphere .",
    "small displacements from hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) can generate sound waves throughout the atmosphere , which , if unchecked , can lead to ambient velocities that can swamp the process being studied .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium improvements described in  @xcite , which remove the hydrostatic pressure from the pressure jump across the interfaces in the riemann problem , were used for all ppm runs .",
    "the upper and lower boundary conditions are the hydrostatic boundaries described in that same paper , with the pressure and density modified according to hydrostatic equilibrium , and the velocities given a zero gradient .",
    "the second compressible algorithm we consider is a second - order unsplit method following @xcite . at low mach number",
    ", dimensionally split methods can have trouble producing realistic velocity fields , as will be shown in the bubble rise comparison . in the unsplit formulation ,",
    "the cell averages are updated in all directions at once .",
    "a critical part of the unsplit method is that the interface reconstructions contain a transverse flux term that explicitly couples in the information from the corner cells .",
    "fourth - order accurate slope limiting is used in the central differences , as well as high - order reconstruction of the states for the transverse riemann problem , as described in @xcite .",
    "this is the same procedure used in predicting the interface states in the low mach number method presented here .",
    "this method was extended to handle general equations of state following the procedure in  @xcite , adding an additional transverse flux piece to the interface reconstruction of @xmath145 , to be consistent with the unsplit reconstructions .",
    "this was put into the flash framework for the present simulations .",
    "both the ppm and unsplit solvers use the same two - shock riemann solver described in  @xcite .",
    "for both the split and unsplit solvers , a cfl number of  0.8 was used based on the sound speed .",
    "the low mach number equations and the anelastic equation set are derived differently .",
    "both equation sets assume a low mach number , equivalently a small pressure perturbation from the background state .",
    "however , the anelastic equation set assumes both small density and small temperature perturbations as well . as noted",
    "earlier the velocity constraints resulting from these two derivations are strikingly similar , and in fact equivalent for an isentropically stratified background state . even in the non - isentropic background considered here ,",
    "the differences between @xmath146 and @xmath107 are small .    however , because the anelastic approximation assumes small density and temperature perturbations , approximations are made to the buoyancy term in the momentum equation .",
    "these follow from the observation that since the perturbational density was neglected in the continuity equation in order to derive the velocity constraint , the continuity equation can not be used to evolve the perturbational density",
    ". thus an alternative formulation of the buoyancy term must be used .",
    "a typical anelastic model evolves temperature or entropy , and constructs the buoyancy forcing term from that field using a linearized approximation . following the derivation by @xcite that combines parts of the pressure gradient and buoyancy terms , we consider the following form of the anelastic equations : @xmath147 here @xmath148 is entropy , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and we have neglected viscosity , thermal diffusivity and the gravitational potential perturbation .",
    "we note that in the case of small density and temperature perturbations , simulations using the low mach number equations and the anelastic approximation give indistinguishable results , thus for the numerical comparisons we focus on problems with finite amplitude perturbations as described in the next subsection .",
    "we present three sets of two - dimensional calculations of a rising bubble in a stellar environment .",
    "the one - dimensional background state ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) is calculated using the kepler code  @xcite , to evolve a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf until the central temperature reaches @xmath154  k , representing conditions just before ignition .",
    "we map a portion of the one - dimensional model onto a uniform two - dimensional grid , and place it into hydrostatic equilibrium with a constant gravitational acceleration ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "we further simplify by ignoring metric terms associated with the radial coordinate and view the domain as cartesian .",
    "we note that neither the constant gravity assumption nor the simplified metric is a limitation of any of the methods presented here , but is chosen in these comparison simulations for simplicity .",
    "the density structure of the model is illustrated in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "all bubbles begin in pressure equilibrium with the background state and are defined by a simple temperature perturbation , from which the density perturbation is calculated .",
    "we consider three different cases , which we will distinguish by the maximum temperature at the center of the bubble , @xmath156 .",
    "the temperature profile of the bubble is then defined by @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159  cm , @xmath160  cm in a domain from @xmath161  cm to @xmath162  cm and @xmath163  cm to @xmath164  cm .",
    "the stellar equation of state is then used to compute @xmath6 given @xmath8 and @xmath153 .",
    "this profile was chosen to give a smooth transition from the ambient temperature to the perturbed temperature , thus minimizing the effects of the numerical slope limiters present in the different hydrodynamics methods . due to the short time scale of the problem thermal diffusivity",
    "is neglected . for all bubble calculations presented the grid has uniform resolution of 384 x 384 ; the adaptive gridding features of all the codes are turned off .",
    "figures [ fig : bubble_6.e9 ] and [ fig : bubble_1.e9 ] present comparisons of simulations using the low mach number approach , two different discretizations of the fully compressible equation set , as well as the anelastic and incompressible equation sets . the low mach number , anelastic and incompressible results are calculated using the projection method approach described in the previous section .",
    "the only differences in methodology occur in the coefficient of velocity in the projection , and in the construction of the buoyancy term .",
    "each of these methods was run at a cfl number of  0.9 based on the maximum advection velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig : bubble_6.e9 ] shows the temperature evolution for @xmath165  k. this corresponds to an atwood number for the bubble of approximately 0.079 . in this simulation , the bubble reaches a mach number of about  0.2 .",
    "in addition to the ppm and unsplit compressible solvers , traditional anelastic and incompressible solvers are shown for comparison .",
    "the low mach number method closely tracks the two compressible solvers .",
    "the incompressible and anelastic results demonstrate the effects of their respective assumptions .",
    "the velocity constraint for the anelastic model is sufficiently accurate to capture the bubble rise , but because of the linearity of the density - temperature relationship in the anelastic approach , the buoyancy term is too small in the anelastic simulation .",
    "by contrast , the incompressible simulation contains the full buoyancy term but due to the incompressibility constraint the bubble can not expand ; consequently , it reaches neutral buoyancy at a much lower level and stops rising .",
    "we do not follow the bubbles past the point where nonlinear instabilities along the sides begin to dominate the evolution .",
    "a more detailed comparison of the results from figure  [ fig : bubble_6.e9 ] is provided in figure  [ fig : compare_6.e9 ] , where temperature contours of the low mach number solution are superimposed on temperature contours of the the unsplit and ppm solutions . here",
    "we see a large degree of overlap , demonstrating that the bubbles have the same rise velocity and size independent of the algorithm .",
    "figure  [ fig : mach ] shows the mach number of the ppm and low mach number methods , further demonstrating the agreement between the two sets of results , with the exception of the unphysical loss of symmetry in the ppm simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : bubble_1.e9 ] shows the temperature evolution for the lower peak temperature case , @xmath166  k , and corresponding atwood number of  0.0024 . over the course of this comparison , the mach number remains below  0.05 .",
    "again , we observe the agreement between the low mach number and compressible solvers , with the exception of the late - time breakdown of the ppm solution , indicated by the large amplitude temperature oscillations dominating the flow behind the bubble .",
    "these oscillations reflect the poor performance of operator split algorithms for very low speed flows .",
    "a more detailed comparison of the results from figure  [ fig : bubble_1.e9 ] is shown in figure  [ fig : compare_1.e9 ] , again superimposing temperature contours from the low mach number and compressible formulations .",
    "we again see good agreement , with the exception of the breakdown of ppm at late times .",
    "timings of the ppm and low mach number code were made on a single processor ( 1.53  ghz athlon mp ) using the intel 8.1 compilers .",
    "both codes were compiled with the same compiler optimization flags : ` -o3 -ip -ipo ` . flash was set to run with @xmath167 zone blocks , instead of the default @xmath168 for better performance with uniform gridding .",
    "the @xmath169  k bubble required 2148 timesteps , taking 14200  s to evolve the bubble to @xmath170  s in simulation time . by comparison ,",
    "the low mach number solver took 246 timesteps and 1480  s , about an order of magnitude speed - up . for the @xmath171  k bubble ,",
    "the ppm solver took 7842 timesteps , taking 52100  s to evolve the bubble for 1  s of simulation time , while the low mach number solver took 252 timesteps and 1560  s. as expected , the performance gap increases as the mach number decreases .",
    "the unsplit compressible algorithm takes approximately twice as much time to run as ppm , primarily due to the additional transverse riemann solves required .",
    "finally , in figures [ fig : bubble_3.5e8 ] and [ fig : compare_unsplit_3.5e8 ] we compare the low mach number and anelastic models for a bubble with @xmath172  k. this regime is inaccessible to the compressible formulation , with a peak mach number during the calculation of @xmath173 .",
    "we note that , as expected , as the atwood number decreases the fidelity of the anelastic approximation improves .",
    "the three cases presented in this section demonstrate successful application of the low mach number approach , as well as failure of the compressible approach for low - speed flows , and failure of the anelastic approach for flows with large density or temperature variations .",
    "the low mach number approach , like the other methods , has limits to its applicability .",
    "specifically , as the flow speed , hence the mach number , increases , typically the thermodynamic pressure will diverge from @xmath69 and the assumptions underlying the low mach number approach will be violated .",
    "as with the anelastic model , numerical simulations using the low mach number model will continue to yield what appear to be reasonable solutions even as the underlying assumptions are violated , but the solutions will no longer be physically relevant .    in the case of a bubble rise without heat sources ,",
    "it is difficult to numerically demonstrate the failure of the low mach number method even as the mach number increases .",
    "however , the divergence of the low mach number model from the compressible solution in the case of large mach number will be discussed more thoroughly in the subsequent paper that discusses the behavior of the low mach number model in the presence of heating .",
    "we have introduced a new method for following low speed , stratified flows in astrophysical conditions and have demonstrated , through comparison with compressible and anelastic codes , that this algorithm performs well in the range of mach number from near zero to about 0.2 .",
    "the increased computational efficiency associated with a low mach number formulation makes it an ideal tool for investigations of the convective / ignition phase of sne ia .",
    "however , to be applicable in this setting , a number of generalizations to the methodology will need to be developed .",
    "in particular , we will need to extend the the algorithm to include the effects of variation in composition , reactions and thermal conduction .",
    "in addition , once a flame is established it will be necessary to include sub - grid models for turbulent flame propagation that will enable the methodology to be used to simulate the evolution of the early phases of the explosion",
    ". these issues will be addressed in future work .",
    "we thank gary glatzmaier , michael kuhlen , and tami rogers for helpful discussions regarding the anelastic hydrodynamics method , and alan calder and jonathan dursi for helpful comments on the manuscript .",
    "we especially thank stan woosley for numerous discussions and interactions .",
