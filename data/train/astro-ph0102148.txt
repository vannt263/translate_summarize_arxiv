    "a description of progress in understanding distances and metallicities of high- and intermediate - velocity neutral hydrogen ( hvcs and ivcs ) is given by wakker ( 2001 ) , who lists all published data concerning ionic absorption lines in such clouds .",
    "this paper is referred to below as `` paper  i '' . the present paper offers a ( re)analysis of 21-cm  data that were used to derive ion/  ratios .",
    "the  data are important for two reasons : a ) if absorption lines due to the hvc or ivc are present , they allow one to derive an ion abundance for the cloud and b ) if such absorption is absent , the  data are required to derive the expected optical line strength , in order to interpret the absence of absorption as a lower distance limit or showing the need for deeper integrations",
    ". this is explained more fully in paper  i ( see description of col .  in that paper ) .",
    "previous experience has suggested that a measurement with the smallest possible beam is required . a few hvc cores have been observed at high angular resolution ( 2 arcmin or better ; schwarz & oort 1981 , wakker & schwarz 1991 , wakker et al .",
    "1996 , braun & burton 2000 ) . from these studies",
    "it is clear that these cores contain much fine structure , with column density contrasts up to a factor 5 at arcminute scales .",
    "outside cores , however , the contrast seems to be less ( wakker et al .",
    "1996 , schwarz & wakker 2001 ) .",
    "also , the factor 5 represents the extreme contrast . for any randomly chosen direction within a field ,",
    "the contrast is closer to a factor 2 over arcminute scales .",
    "it is not known whether similar contrast would occur if observations with even smaller beams could be made . a possible way of studying this is to compare n ( ) as observed at 21-cm with n ( ) derived from ly@xmath0 absorption toward extra - galactic background sources .",
    "a preliminary analysis of this kind by savage et al .  ( 2000 ) suggests that n(-ly@xmath0 ) usually lies in the range 0.61 times n(-21-cm ) .",
    "however , with this method it is not possible to separately measure n ( ) for different components . for further discussion see sect .  .",
    "interferometer maps ( 12 arcmin beam ) clearly are necessary to get accurate abundances for important background probes , but it is impractical to observe every probe that way . the next - best estimate requires a large single - dish telescope . for probes with declinations between about 0 and + 38 degrees , arecibo ( 3 arcmin beam ) is preferable , though data are rarely available .",
    "we used the 100-m effelsberg telescope ( 9 arcmin beam ) for probes with declinations above about @xmath130 degrees . in the future the 100-m gbt ( green bank telescope ) may also prove useful .",
    "effelsberg data were obtained for about half of the 269 probes listed in paper  i ( excluding the 52 stars in the lmc ) . for about a quarter of these probes ,",
    "other good single - dish data exist , obtained with the telescopes at arecibo ( 3 arcmin beam ) , jodrell bank ( 12 arcmin beam ) , parkes ( 15 arcmin beam ) , green bank ( 21 arcmin beam ) and hat creek ( 36 arcmin beam , but 0.0015k rms ) . for the remaining quarter we needed to use the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( lds ) of hartmann & burton ( 1997 ) , which has a 35 arcmin beam .",
    "the effelsberg data allow us for the first time to systematically analyze the difference of n ( ) observed with a 9  beam vs a 35  beam , as lds data are available for every direction north of declination @xmath135 .",
    "section  gives a description of the effelsberg observations , which have not been presented elsewhere .",
    "section  summarizes the characteristics of the other data .",
    "section  describes the procedure used to derive n ( ) for the hvc and ivc components , and sect .  describes the spectra shown in fig .  1 .",
    "that figure presents an  spectrum for each of the probes for which absorption line measurements are listed in paper  i. finally , in sect .",
    "we make a preliminary analysis of the difference between n ( ) as observed at effelsberg vs n ( ) in the same direction as extracted from the lds .",
    "observations were done on 19 dates : 12 jan 1995 , 24 jan 1995 , 26 aug 1995 , 10 sep 1995 , 1112 aug 1996 , 1314 sep 1996 , 27 jun 1999 , 1214 jul 1999 , 3 mar 2000 , 2526 mar 2000 , 34 apr 2000 , 34 may 2000 .",
    "the large gap between 1996 and 1999 is caused by a problem with interference that is most probably due to digital audio broadcasting ( dab ) .",
    "the dab transmission at a frequency near 1452 mhz was variable in intensity and strongly polarized .",
    "the nearest transmitter at a distance of 30 km caused interference which was received through the backlobes of the telescope , even under the most favorable circumstances .",
    "this interference caused spurious lines and partly a saturation of the receiver , resulting in strongly variable baseline ripples which made a proper data reduction for weak lines impossible .",
    "fortunately , dab turned out to be of little commercial interest , and it was switched off .",
    "further interference was found to be caused by local equipment ( workstations and active components ) .",
    "most of the interference from such components was removed either by shielding or switching off the devices .",
    "data taken before sep 1996 generally are of good quality , with baselines that were relatively easy to determine and not affected by interference .",
    "the sep 1996 data vary in quality , as during some times of the day interference popped up .",
    "many spectra were unusable because of interference spikes at frequencies of interest or because interference caused bad baselines .",
    "about 50% of the june / july 1999 data are generally usable , though some caution is needed .",
    "baselines may show strong curvature , and s - shaped interference spikes can be seen in many spectra ( see e.g.  those of bd+102179 , hd83206 , mrk279 , pg0804 + 761 and pks0837@xmath112 ) .",
    "in contrast with earlier runs , the spectra from the two receivers ( one for each polarization ) were separately reduced , as in about 20% of the cases only one of the two was corrupted .",
    "spectra taken in 2000 tend to show less interference and are of slightly higher quality than the 1999 set",
    ". however , again only about 50% are usable .    in the 1995 and 1996 runs ,",
    "a total of 469 spectra were taken , toward 173 different probes .",
    "directions were selected in three ways .",
    "for about 40 probes high - resolution absorption line data already existed . for about 130 probes",
    "high - resolution absorption line data were anticipated or hoped for ( about 50 of these have now indeed been observed ) .",
    "the corresponding  data will be published together with the absorption - line data .",
    "finally , for 12 probes high - angular resolution ( 12 arcmin ) westerbork data existed , and a 3@xmath23 grid of positions was observed .    during the 1999 and 2000 runs 247 spectra were taken of 105 different probes .",
    "all of these were selected because high - resolution absorption line data existed ( see paper  i ) .",
    "for this set the results for each polarization were separately reduced , effectively leading to 494 spectra .",
    "further , integration times for individual spectra were limited to 5 minutes , even if the total on the target could be up to 30 minutes .",
    "each of these spectra was judged individually , and if interference clearly posed a problem the spectrum was eliminated .",
    "the remaining spectra were averaged ( a few times also adding in a spectrum with shorter integration time from 1995 or 1996 ) to form the final spectrum toward a target .",
    "because of some overlap between the two sets of runs ( for targets where the earlier spectra were not good or deep enough ) , a total of 249 probes has been observed . of these ,",
    "91 have high - resolution absorption data .",
    "the  column densities for these are included in the table in paper  i  the spectra are shown here .",
    "the data processing has been performed using the standard reduction programs of the max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie and the radioastronomical institute of the university bonn .",
    "the antenna temperature of the observed spectra has been calibrated against iau standard position s7 ( kalberla et al.1982 ) . afterwards the stray radiation from the sidelobes of the antenna diagram was removed ( kalberla et al .",
    "1980 ) .",
    "the instrumental baseline was removed after fitting a third order polynomial to those channels which were free of line emission .",
    "a number of observations were seriously affected by baseline ripples and a polynomial of order 5 to 7 had to be used .",
    "this was the case for e.g.  the spectra of hd12323 , hd12993 and pg1519 + 640 , where a residual ripple can be seen . in cases such as these ,",
    "the brightness temperatures for the low - velocity gas are unreliable , but the baseline under the hvc is still acceptable for determining n ( ) to within @xmath325% . if this is the case and if the star is not critical for determining a lower distance limit to a cloud , the spectrum is still included in the sample .",
    "the spectra were taken with two hemt receivers for two independent branches with different circular polarization .",
    "the data processing was independent for both channels .",
    "after the reduction we intercompared and averaged both spectra .",
    "interference and instrumental problems usually resulted in discrepant spectra .",
    "such data have been rejected except for those cases in which obviously only a single channel was affected .",
    "the final rms noise varies with the integration time and also somewhat between runs .",
    "a typical value is 0.055k in 10 minutes for the 1995/1996 data .",
    "for the 1999/2000 data interference and baseline problems cause the measured noise to vary by a factor up to 1.5 for a given integration time , although the average value still is typically 0.055k in 10 minutes .",
    "for slightly over half of the probes in paper  i , n ( ) is based on data from a telescope other than effelsberg . this can be for one of four reasons .",
    "a ) higher - angular resolution data are available ( 23 probes ; sometimes these were combined with the effelsberg spectrum ) .",
    "b ) higher - quality ( i.e.  higher signal - to - noise ratio or less interference ) single - dish spectra are available ( 44 probes ) .",
    "c ) the probe is in the southern sky ( 14 probes ) .",
    "d ) no directed single - dish data are available ( 67 probes ) . in the latter case",
    "the data in the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( lds , hartmann & burton 1997 ) were used .",
    "this gives spectra at each half - degree point in longitude and latitude .",
    "a weighted average was constructed from the four spectra surrounding the target direction , with weights max(0,0.5@xmath4 ) ( with @xmath5 and @xmath6 in degrees ) .",
    "special cases are posed by 31 targets for which effelsberg data were used to derive n ( ) , even though fig .",
    "1 does not show the effelsberg spectrum in the direction of the probe .",
    "first , for the 22 stars in m15 for which absorption - line data exist , the final value of n ( ) is based on an interpolation between nine effelsberg spectra that are positioned on a 3@xmath23 grid with 5  spacing .",
    "only the central position is shown in fig .  1",
    ". second , for 9 probes the published value is based on an effelsberg spectrum , but the original data were lost .",
    "this pertains to 3 probes of complex  a observed by lilienthal et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , and to 6 probes of complexes c , h and k observed by centurin et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . for these targets , fig .",
    "1 shows a spectrum based on the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( see below ) , but the best final value of n ( ) is based on the published spectrum .",
    "there are also a number of cases where a probe was observed at arecibo or with an interferometer as well as at effelsberg , but we do not have the high - angular resolution spectrum available in digital form . then the effelsberg spectrum is shown in fig .  1 , but the label contains , e.g. , `` use arecibo '' as a warning that the column density used in paper  i was derived from the better data .    a final special case is presented by sn1993j .",
    "two spectra are shown in fig .  1 .",

    "second , a spectrum in which m81 was removed by means of a third - order polynomial fit .      for 9 probes",
    "the effelsberg spectrum is complemented by data taken with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) : 0159 + 625 from wakker & schwarz ( 1991 ) , pg0832 + 675 from schwarz et al .",

    "further , for the + 73  component toward hd100340 and the @xmath143  component toward hd137569 , the published column density limit based on the green bank spectrum is better than the limit based on the lds spectrum .",
    "savage et al .",
    "( 2000 ) used previously unpublished data obtained by murphy with the green bank 140-ft telescope in the direction of many agns that were also observed using the faint object spectrograph on the hubble space telescope .",
    "these spectra are of very high quality and have noise levels of about 0.015k . for a few probes a high - quality effelsberg spectrum also exists ( 3c351.0 , h1821 + 643 , hs0624 + 6907 , pks1136@xmath113 and pg1116 + 215 ) .",

    "thus , for these five probes the value of ( or limit for ) n ( ) is derived from the effelsberg spectrum , while for the remaining agns discussed by savage et al .",
    "( 2000 ) paper  i uses the values for n ( ) and velocity derived from the green bank spectrum . in fig .  1",

    "sixteen hvc / ivc probes lie below declination @xmath135 , the limit of the leiden - dwingeloo survey . for two of these",
    "an _ atca _ spectrum was obtained ( ngc3783 and hd101274 , see above ) . for the remaining probes ,",
    "spectra were extracted from observations made with the 64-m parkes radio telescope equipped with a 21-cm multi - beam receiver ( staveley - smith 1997 ) . for ten of these ,",
    "high - velocity resolution data ( 0.8 ) were available via observations made with the narrow - band multi - feed facility ( haynes et al .",
    "1999 ; brns et al.2001 ) .",
    "the narrow - band system utilizes the central 7 beams of the 13-beam multibeam receiver with two orthogonal polarizations and a bandwidth of 8 mhz .",
    "narrow - band data were unavailable for three of the sources , and the spectra were therefore taken from the hvc - reduced ( putman et al .",
    "2001 ) ``  parkes all - sky survey '' ( _ hipass _ ; barnes et al .  2001 ) .",
    "the standard _",
    "hipass _ reduction method filters out emission which extends over more than 2  in declination , while the hvc method recovers the emission unless it completely fills an 8  scan .",
    "after hanning smoothing , these data have a velocity resolution of 26  and this low resolution makes it difficult to discern the weak hvc ( and especially ivc ) components . at 21-cm",
    "the parkes telescope has a beamwidth of 14 , but the gridding process which combines the individual scans increases the spatial resolution to 155@xmath81 .",
    "the spectra were extracted from the gridded data at the pixel closest to the coordinates of the probe .",
    "to derive column densities for the hvc and ivc components in the spectra , a decomposition into gaussians was made .",
    "the fitting procedure requires an estimate of the rms noise and a set of initial estimates .",
    "since the purpose of the fitting is to determine n ( ) and  for the hvcs and ivcs , no great effort was made to obtain perfect fits to the peak near 0  that is present in all spectra .",
    "still , that component is often fitted quite well , although in a few cases line wings were not fitted . for the hvc and ivc components ,",
    "however , extra care was always taken . for probes near the galactic plane ( in hvc complex  h ) ,",
    "the low - velocity gas was not fitted , as the structure is very complex and components can easily be artificial superpositions in the line of sight .",
    "the rms was estimated from a spectral region free from  emission . wherever possible the region between @xmath1400 and @xmath1200  ( @xmath1250when necessary ) was used . however , for a substantial fraction ( 33% ) of spectra there is either an hvc component ( 10% of the 33% lie in the magellanic stream ) or interference at those velocities , in which case an alternative range is used . see fig .  1 for the actual selected velocity range for each target .    for about half of the spectra it was possible to make an initial estimate automatically . for the other half , it was necessary to help the fit along by giving a fairly good estimate of the amplitude , velocity and width .",
    "care was taken to make sure that in general the final fitted components were no broader than about 40 . however , there are a few exceptional cases where the hvc or ivc profile is fitted just as well by a single component as by two components ( e.g.  for izw18 ) .",
    "larger widths were then allowed .    in 40% of the cases",
    "the fit was made piecewise , i.e.  two spectral regions were fit separately .",
    "this mostly happens when the hvc component is weak .",
    "then the formal fit for the low - velocity component can usually be improved by adding one ( or more ) components , even if these are not clearly seen by eye .",
    "the fitting procedure then tends to ignore the weak hvc component , unless an unrealistic total number of components is used .",
    "sometimes piecewise fits were also needed if the central component has broad wings .",
    "free fitting then tends to create components with unrealistic fwhms of 80  or more , which then absorb the hvc / ivc component . by restricting the velocity range of the fit this problem",
    "can usually be avoided .",
    "this procedure works well in most cases , but a few times some artifacts remain visible in the fit for the low - velocity gas ( e.g.  for 3c395 , hd32641 , hd45315 and mrk509 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the spectra and the fits . all probes in table  2 of paper",
    "i are shown .",
    "the order is alphabetical , rather than by cloud , as about a third of the sightlines goes through more than one cloud .    for each target",
    "the  spectrum is shown with two vertical scales .",
    "the top scale emphasizes the low - velocity gas , the bottom scale gives the clearest view of the hvc or ivc component . in both cases",
    "the gaussian fit is superposed on the actual spectrum .",
    "the velocity range used to estimate the rms noise is shown as a horizontal bar in the top spectrum . a label is included too , which gives on the first line the probe name and on the second line the galactic longitude and latitude .",
    "the third line gives some information about the observations .",
    "for spectra obtained using effelsberg , the date of observation is given in the format `` yymmdd '' , as is the integration time , in minutes .",
    "if the final n ( ) values used in paper  i were obtained from another telescope this is indicated too , by a label such as `` use arecibo '' .",
    "the fourth label line shows the velocity resolution and rms noise .",
    "the velocity resolution is 1.28for effelsberg data , 1.21  for jodrell bank data , 0.82  for parkes data and 1.03  for spectra extracted from the lds . for all these the label gives `` 1 km / s '' . for parkes _ hipass _ data the velocity resolution is 26 . in a number of cases it was necessary to smooth to 2 , 4 or even 8  to be able to fit a weak hvc component . the lower resolution data are then shown on the plot .",
    "below the two spectra a list of components is given .",
    "this gives for each component the central velocity ( in ) , the amplitude ( in k ) , the fwhm ( in ) and the derived column density with its error ( in units of 2 ) .",
    "the final column gives ( for hvc and ivc components ) the cloud name with which the component is identified , based on the catalogues of wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) and kuntz & danly ( 1996 ) and some new definitions given in paper  i. in a few cases the text `` other ivc '' is given , which refers to an unnamed ivc listed in the set of `` other negative / positive ivcs '' in table  2 of paper  i. notes in square brackets , such as `` [ wsrt : @xmath1199 190 ] '' give the telescope , velocity and column density for hvc and ivc components if the final value was based on better data than the effelsberg or lds spectrum that is shown . in a few cases , such a note is not associated with a fitted component , indicating the existence of an absorption without associated , or the existence of an  component fainter than what is visible in the displayed spectrum .    for a number of spectra",

    "apparently there is a small patch of bright  right around h1821 + 643 , which is picked up by the green bank and effelsberg telescopes , but beam - diluted in the lds beam .",
    "however , the maximum dilution factor between the 21  green bank and the 35  lds beam is only a factor 3 , so some of the discrepancy must be due to a baseline error or just too low an s / n ratio in the lds spectrum .",

    "\\7 ) the @xmath1100  complex  l component toward hd135485 is four times weaker in the 1  beam combined wsrt and jodrell bank data than in the lds data .",
    "this is probably related to the fact that the surrounding cloud is fairly small and shows much structure .",

    "the listed component is a fit to the left wing of the profile . at neighbouring positions two separate components",

    "\\11 ) the parameters of the ivc fitted to the  spectrum toward sn1981d are rather uncertain since the spectral resolution is just 26 .",
    "\\12 ) the vhvc fit to the  spectrum toward sn1986 g is vary narrow .",
    "this may or may not be realistic .",
    "better data are needed to tell .",
    "\\13 ) for sn1993j , the contribution of m81 was removed by fitting a third order polynomial to the velocity ranges @xmath1120 to @xmath180 and + 30 to + 70 .",
    "the lliv and low - velocity component were then fitted .",
    "however , it is not clear how much of the emission near @xmath125  is associated with m81 .",
    "including the velocity range @xmath135 to @xmath120  in the baseline reduces the column density of the lliv component from 80 to 602 .",
    "the final value used in paper  i thus is 70@xmath8102 .",
    "for each of the directions in which an effelsberg spectrum was available , we also extracted a spectrum from the lds in the manner described in sect .",
    "a gaussian fit was made to this spectrum , in almost all cases using the same initial estimates as for the effelsberg spectrum . in a few cases subtle differences required an extra low - velocity component for one of the two , or other small adaptations .",
    "figure  2 shows some examples of the differences observed in the profiles with a 9.1 and a 35 arcmin beam .",
    "these examples were chosen to illustrate some of the more extreme differences .",
    "the @xmath1181  component toward 3c351.0 illustrates that some faint hvc components can be clearly visible in a 35 arcmin beam , but disappear at higher angular resolution .",
    "this spectrum also illustrates structure in the low - velocity gas , which has n()=1572  at 35 arcmin , but 1772  at 9 arcmin .",
    "the spectrum of bd+63 985 illustrates fine structure in the iv arch ( core iv21 ) . toward bs16079 - 0017 the column density of the low - velocity gas increases by 30% when going from a 35 arcmin to a 9 arcmin beam .",
    "the spectrum toward h1821 + 643 shows that high - velocity components can also appear , rather than disappear , at higher angular resolution .",
    "hd83206 illustrates that components can appear separated at low angular resolution , but blended at higher angular resolution .",
    "the spectrum toward m15 shows that small - scale structure also occurs at positive velocities .",
    "mrk106 illustrates another case of varying relative strength of low- and intermediate - velocity gas . toward mrk116",
    "the low - velocity component at + 7  is 60% weaker at lower angular resolution .",
    "the 9 arcmin effelsberg spectrum of mrk279 shows 8 identified components , all of which are present in the lds spectrum , but with different relative strengths .",
    "pg1259 + 593 illustrates how the high - velocity component differs by a factor 2 in column density ; this is near a core of hvc complex  c.    using all of the gaussian fits , a table was made of n ( ) observed at either telescope , separately for the high- , intermediate- and low - velocity components .",
    "the low - velocity peak usually had to be fit with 2 or 3 components , once with 4 , once with 5 , while in 14% of the cases 1 component was sufficient .",
    "for the comparison , all low - velocity components were combined , as the exact decomposition depends on the details of the profile rather than on the real physical origin of the components .",
    "figures  3 and 4 present the results in graphical form . in fig .",
    "3 the left panels show the ratio as function of log n(-eff ) , separately for high- , intermediate- and low - velocity gas .",
    "the right panels show the histogram of ratios for the three kinds of gas .",
    "figure  4 shows the scatter plot and histogram of column density differences .      for high- and intermediate - velocity clouds",
    "the ratio , @xmath9 , of n ( ) measured with a 9 vs a 35 arcmin beam lies in the range 0.252.5 ( 0.32.1 when excluding the three most extreme points at either end ) .",
    "the full range is seen in most of the individual hvcs and ivcs , suggesting that the small - scale structure has similar characteristics in each of these . in one case ( pg0229",
    "+ 064 , next to the cohen stream ) the ratio is 0 , as the hvc is not seen at all in the effelsberg beam , although the lds spectrum suggests n()=202 . for hvcs the distribution of ratios peaks at a ratio @xmath9@xmath30.7 (",
    "the median is 0.8 ) , and it is slightly skewed towards values of @xmath9@xmath71 ( 10 ratios fall between 0 and 0.5 , 32 between 0.5 and 1 , 18 between 1 and 1.5 , and 9 above 1.5 ) . for ivcs",
    "the distribution appears more symmetrical ( the median is 1.03 and 15 lie between 0.5 and 1 , 18 between 1 and 1.5 ) .",
    "the skewness for the hvc ratio distribution may be real as bright condensations fill only a fraction @xmath750% of the dwingeloo beam , and an arbitrary direction will in most cases have smaller n ( ) than the average of a larger area seen in the dwingeloo beam .    for the hvcs and ivcs , the maximum difference between the two column density measurements tends to increase with increasing n ( ) , and can go either way .",
    "the histograms of differences are centered around no difference , with a range of @xmath8302 .",
    "this width is mostly determined by the directions with high n ( ) , as the range of ratios is independent of n ( ) .      for low - velocity gas ,",
    "the ratio distribution is much narrower , with a sharp peak and a range of only 0.762.0 ( 0.921.4 when excluding the three most extreme points at either end ) .",
    "however , the peak is centered around a ratio of 1.1 , not 1 . below",
    "we suggest that this offset is an artifact of the stray - radiation correction .",
    "if so , the real range of ratios would be 0.851.3 .",
    "this range is smaller than for hvcs and ivcs .",
    "the histogram of differences for low - velocity gas is offset from zero by about 152 , and positive differences ( i.e.  n(-eff)@xmath10n(-lds ) ) dominate .",
    "this is the same effect as seen in the offset of the average ratio .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the difference between hvcs / ivcs and low - velocity gas in the range of ratios .",
    "1 ) there is intrinsically less small - scale structure in the nearby low - velocity gas .",
    "2 ) the relative magnitude of fluctuations may decrease with spatial size , and because the low - velocity gas is closer we are probing smaller absolute scales .",
    "3 ) this is an artifact because for the low - velocity gas two or more components are mixed together , so that upward fluctuations in one component may be compensated by downward fluctuations in another component .",
    "that the third of these effects plays a role is indicated by the histogram of ratios for the 11 sightlines where just one component was fit for the low - velocity gas .",
    "that distribution has a larger dispersion than the histogram for all low - velocity gas .",
    "the offset in the average value of n(-eff ) and n(-lds ) observed for the low - velocity gas is not completely understood .",
    "it is unlikely to be due to a calibration ( i.e.  scaling ) error , as then the same offset should have been seen for the hvcs and ivcs .",
    "a more likely possibility is that the stray - radiation correction is not completely correct .",
    "this correction has been applied to both datasets .",
    "the lds data are used to correct themselves , and the effelsberg data are corrected using the corrected lds - data . apparently there is a slight undercorrection in the latter case , which amounts to about 152on average . for the high - latitude directions studied here that is on average 10% of n ( ) .",
    "however , most of the correction is due to higher column density low - latitude directions , so this is no more than @xmath31% of the total correction .    such a problem may indicate that the correction for the far sidelobes is slightly incorrect ( about 1 to 2% of the total correction ) .",
    "the effelsberg antenna pattern was determined by kalberla et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and updated in 1992 . after this date",
    "some mechanical changes within the telescope surface were made .",
    "a problem may arise from spoilers which have been mounted on the feed support legs .",
    "the intention was to eliminate baseline ripples due to standing waves at short wavelengths .",
    "however , at 21 cm these spoilers are expected to increase the effective cross section for the scattering of waves falling on the feed support legs .",
    "we suspect that the stray cones of the antenna diagram due to the feed support legs have been altered by these mechanical modifications .",
    "attempts to improve the quality of the antenna diagram which is used to correct for stray radiation remained unsuccessful .",
    "table  1 lists the values measured for n ( ) in the direction of 16 probes of hvcs for which  data exist at high resolution .",
    "there are two groups .",
    "first , probes for which 21-cm interferometer data exist , so that individual velocity components can be compared with single - dish data .",
    "second , distant stars or extra - galactic probes for which the integrated  column density along the line of sight was also measured using ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "this table shows that the ratio n(-2)/n(-35 ) has the same wide range of 0.252.5 as the ratio n(-9)/n(-35 ) . when excluding the extreme value at each end the range is 0.542.0 .",
    "however , the ratio n(-2)/n(-9 ) lies in the much narrower range 0.741.24 ( 0.751.06 when excluding the extreme value at each end ) .",
    "this is consistent with the result described in sect .  , where we showed that the contrast between a 9 and a 35 arcmin beam is a factor up to 2.5 .",
    "the difference in ranges suggests that n ( ) derived from a 9  beam approximates the value obtained at higher resolution to within 25% , and that on average n ( ) tends to be slightly lower at higher resolution .",
    "measuring n ( ) using ly@xmath0 absorption gives the smallest possible beam ( @xmath70.1 arcsec ) .",
    "however , only the combined column density in all components can be measured .",
    "still , this may give some indication of structure on scales smaller than the 1  limit of interferometers , since the integrated column density is usually dominated by the low - velocity components .",
    "effelsberg data exist toward 6 agns in the sample of savage et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who measured n(-ly@xmath0 ) using the faint object spectrograph ( _ fos _ ) on the hubble space telescope .",
    "effelsberg data are also available for distant two stars in the sample of diplas & savage ( 1994 ) , who measured n(-ly@xmath0 ) using _",
    "iue_. excluding the deviant value toward hs0624 + 6907 , which has a particularly large systematic uncertainty , the ratio n(-ly@xmath0)/n(-eff ) lies in the range 0.740.98 .",
    "this range is slightly narrower but similar to that found for n(-ly@xmath0)/n(-green bank ) ( 0.630.87 ) , but smaller than that for n(-ly@xmath0)/n(-lds ) ( 0.691.24 ) .",
    "even though this is a small sample , it suggests that measurements of n ( ) with a 9 arcmin beam are sufficient to obtain reasonable column density estimates , whereas measurements with a 35 arcmin beam are only accurate to a factor of about 23",
    ".    it would be useful to also compare the effelsberg 9 arcmin and lds 35 arcmin column densities with observations with an intermediate beam , such as the 21 arcmin beam provided by the green bank 140-ft .",
    "the data of murphy et al.(2000 ) for agns observed with the _ fos _ provide numbers for about 190 directions .",
    "however , so far only 10 of these have also been observed at effelsberg , and most do not show well - isolated hvc or ivc component .",
    "so , only a limited comparison will be possible .",
    "\\a ) for hvcs and ivcs improving the resolution by a factor @xmath34 ( from 35  to 9  beam , a factor 15 in area ) can change the derived value of n ( ) by a factor up to about 3 either way . in most ( two - thirds ) of the directions",
    "the change is a factor @xmath101.5 either way , while in just one - third is the change a factor between 0.5 and 1.5 .",
    "\\b ) for hvcs / ivcs where higher resolution data are available , the ratio between n ( ) as observed with a 12  beam vs a 9  beam ( a factor @xmath320 in area ) lies in the range 0.741.24 whereas comparing 12  data with 35  data ( another factor @xmath320 in area ) gives a range 0.252.5 .",
    "the effelsberg telescope belongs to the max planck institute for radio astronomy in bonn .",
    "we thank carl heiles for observing the sightline to sn1991 t for 24 hours , using the hat creek telescope .",
