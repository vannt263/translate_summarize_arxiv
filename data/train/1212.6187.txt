    "quantum correlation @xcite is known to be a necessary ingredient of most quantum information protocols that are advantageous over their classical counterparts .",
    "such protocols include quantum communication processes @xcite like quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , as well as quantum computational tasks @xcite like the one - way quantum computer @xcite and deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit @xcite .",
    "such theoretical breakthroughs have been closely followed by experimental realizations of these protocols in several physical systems like photons , trapped ions , atoms in optical lattices , nuclear magnetic resonance , etc . @xcite .",
    "these developments necessitate the characterization and quantification of quantum correlations of quantum states shared between separated observers . however , the understanding of entanglement of multisite systems , i.e. , systems of more than two particles is still limited , due to its structural complexity @xcite .",
    "this is also true for information - theoretic quantum correlation measures @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the commercialization of quantum information protocols requires the realization of multiparticle quantum correlated systems . for example , a quantum computer is more powerful than its classical counterpart , only when quantum coherence can be built among at least thousands of accessible qubits @xcite .",
    "multipartite quantum correlation can be quantified in a large variety of ways .",
    "an important one is by using the concept of monogamy of shared _ bipartite _ quantum correlations in a multiparty quantum system @xcite .",
    "monogamy is an important connecting theme among the bipartite quantum correlation measures , and in simple terms requires that if two particles share a quantum state with a high quantum correlation , they can not have a significant amount of quantum correlation with any third particle .",
    "multiparty quantum correlation measures , that are constructed via the concept of monogamy of a bipartite quantum correlation , has the added benefit of providing information about the sharability of bipartite quantum correlations in the corresponding multiparty system .",
    "such multiparty quantum correlations can be formulated by using a variety of bipartite quantum correlation measures , where the latter can belong to the entanglement - separability paradigm @xcite or the information - theoretic one @xcite .",
    "below we consider two such measures , one from each paradigm , and are respectively called the tangle @xcite and the discord monogamy score @xcite .",
    "multipartite quantum correlations can also be quantified independently of the monogamy concept , an example being the generalized geometric measure ( ggm ) , which is measure of genuine multiparty entanglement in multiparty quantum states .",
    "importantly , the ggm can be efficiently computed for pure states of an arbitrary number of parties in arbitrary dimensions @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is important to establish a connection between the multiparty entanglement content of multipartite quantum states with their ability to act as substrates in quantum information protocols .",
    "a paradigmatic example of a quantum information protocol is quantum dense coding @xcite , where an observer sends classical information to another observer , by using a shared quantum state .",
    "the protocol has been generalized to the case of multiple ports @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", it is the case of multiple ports that is potentially more useful in applications of the quantum dense coding protocol . in the present article",
    ", we show that for a given amount of multiparty quantum correlation in any three - qubit pure state , its ability to act as a channel for multiport classical information transmission via quantum states is bounded above by that of a one - parameter class of three - qubit states , which we call the maximally dense coding capable ( mdcc ) family of states .",
    "more precisely , for any three - qubit pure state , with an arbitrarily fixed amount of multiparty quantum correlation , we show that its quantum advantage in multiport dense coding is always lower than that of the mdcc state with the same amount of the multiparty quantum correlation .",
    "we prove the result in the cases when the multiparty measure is the ggm or the tangle or the discord monogamy score , the results lead to a generic complementarity relation between the quantum advantage in multiport dense coding and multipartite quantum correlation for three - qubit pure states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ esmeasures ] , we introduce the multipartite quantum correlation measures , viz . , the generalized geometric measure , tangle , and discord monogamy score . in sec .",
    "[ qdcdca ] , we set the notation for the multiport quantum dense coding protocol , its capacity , and the corresponding quantum advantage . in sec .",
    "[ esdcadv ] , we establish the complementarity relation between the quantum dense coding advantage and the various multiparty quantum correlation measures . the conclusions on our results are sketched in sec .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss about the multipartite quantum correlation measures that will be required later in the paper .",
    "they are the generalized geometric measure , tangle , and discord monogamy score .",
    "the first two measures belongs to the entanglement - separability paradigm , while the third one belongs to the information - theoretic one .",
    "we will also discuss the concept of monogamy of quantum correlations .",
    "while the first measure is based on the concept of distance to a relevant class of states , the other two are based on the concept of monogamy .",
    "a multipartite pure quantum state @xmath0 , shared between @xmath1 parties , @xmath2 , is said to be genuinely multipartite entangled if it is not separable across any bipartition . to quantify the genuine multipartite entanglement for these states",
    ", one can define an entanglement measure based on the distance from the set of all multiparty states that are not genuinely multiparty entangled . in this spirit ,",
    "the generalized geometric measure @xcite is defined as @xmath3 where the maximization is performed over all states @xmath4 which are not genuinely multipartite entangled .",
    "it turns out that it is possible to compute the ggm efficiently for quantum states of an arbitrary number of parties in arbitrary dimensions , by using the following result @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the maximal schmidt coefficient in the @xmath7 bipartite split of @xmath8 .      unlike the ggm ,",
    "the multipartite quantum correlation measures in this and the following subsections are based on the concept of monogamy . for a given quantum correlation measure , @xmath9 , and for an arbitrary three - party quantum state @xmath10 , shared between alice @xmath11 , bob @xmath12 , and charu @xmath13 , the amount of quantum correlation shared between the alice - bob pair and the alice - charu pair is typically restricted by the monogamy of quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "the sum of the quantum correlations of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 pairs is therefore non - trivially bounded .",
    "note here that we have arbitrarily assigned alice as the `` nodal observer '' .",
    "a three - party quantum state @xmath10 is said to be monogamous with respect to a quantum correlation measure @xmath9 , if the nontrivial bound is @xmath16 @xcite , i.e. , if it satisfies the inequality @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the quantum correlation between the alice - bob pair , @xmath19 is the same for the alice - charu pair , and @xmath16 is the quantum correlation between alice and the bob - charu pair .",
    "the tripartite physical quantity @xmath20 known as the quantum monogamy score ( corresponding to the measure @xmath9 ) @xcite , can be expected to quantify the tripartite quantum correlations in the state @xmath10 .",
    "the tangle is the quantum monogamy score corresponding to the square of the bipartite entanglement measure called concurrence , which we define now briefly .",
    "the concurrence quantifies the amount of entanglement present in a two - qubit state and it originated from the entanglement of formation @xcite . for a two - qubit state @xmath21 , shared between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,",
    "the concurrence is defined as @xmath24 where the @xmath25 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath26 in decreasing order .",
    "@xmath27 , with the complex conjugation being taken in the computational basis .",
    "@xmath28 is the pauli spin matrix .    the tangle for the three - qubit state @xmath10 is given by @xcite @xmath29    for notational convenience",
    ", we have denoted the tangle as @xmath30 .",
    "note that we have defined the tangle for three - qubit states only .",
    "the tangle is monogamous for all three - qubit states @xcite .      in the preceding subsections ,",
    "we have defined multiparty quantum correlation measures that fall within the entanglement - separability paradigm .",
    "we now define a multiparty quantum correlation measure based on information - theoretic concepts .",
    "however , just like for the tangle , we again use the concept of monogamy . to proceed further , we have to define the bipartite information - theoretic quantum correlation measure called quantum discord .",
    "quantum discord is defined , for a two - party quantum state @xmath21 , as the difference between two quantum information - theoretic quantities @xcite : @xmath31 classically , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the mutual information and they are equivalent .",
    "quantum mechanically , @xmath32 , of a bipartite state @xmath21 , corresponds to the total correlation , and is given by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the von neumann entropy of the quantum state @xmath36 , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the reduced density matrices of @xmath21 . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath33 is argued to be a measure of classical correlations @xcite and is defined as @xmath39 the conditional entropy , @xmath40 , is obtained by performing a projection - valued measurement on @xmath23 and is given by @xmath41 the measurement is performed on the complete set of rank - one projectors @xmath42 and the probability of obtaining the outcome @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 $ ] , with @xmath45 being the identity operator on the hilbert space of @xmath22 .",
    "the output state at @xmath22 corresponding to the outcome @xmath42 is @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "the discord monogamy score was introduced as a multipartite quantum correlation measure by using the monogamy considerations of the quantum discord in refs .",
    "it is defined as the quantum monogamy score corresponding to quantum discord : @xmath47 note that unlike the square of the concurrence , quantum discord for three - qubit states can be both monogamous and non - monogamous @xcite .",
    "quantum dense coding is a quantum communication protocol by which an observer can send classical information , beyond a certain `` classical limit '' , by using shared entanglement @xcite .",
    "suppose a sender , alice , and a receiver , bob , share an arbitrary quantum state @xmath21 , defined in the hilbert space @xmath48 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are respectively @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the amount of classical information that can be sent by alice to bob is given by @xmath53 where the resources necessary are the shared quantum state @xmath21 and a noiseless quantum channel for @xmath51-dimensional quantum states from alice to bob . without the use of the shared quantum state",
    ", alice will be able to send only @xmath54 bits of classical information . using the shared quantum state",
    "is therefore advantageous only if the `` coherent information '' , i.e. @xmath55 , is positive . the corresponding quantum state is then referred to as `` dense codeable '' .",
    "@xmath56 is the capacity of quantum dense coding .",
    "consider now a multiport situation with a single sender , alice @xmath11 , and @xmath1 receivers , called bobs and denoted as @xmath57 , and suppose that they share a multipartite quantum state @xmath58 .",
    "we consider a situation where @xmath22 wants to send classical messages to all the bobs individually by using the multiparty shared state @xmath58 in a dense coding protocol .",
    "the quantum advantage of such a multiport dense coding protocol can be defined as @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 are the local density matrices of the state @xmath58 for the corresponding parties .",
    "in this section , we establish a relation between the quantum advantage in the multiport dense coding protocol and multipartite quantum correlation measures for three - qubit pure states .",
    "we introduce a family of three - qubit pure states , which we call the maximally dense coding capable states . for a given amount of multiparty quantum correlation ,",
    "the three - qubit pure state that is best suited for multiport dense coding is always from this mdcc family .",
    "we begin in subsection [ sec : ggmvsdca ] with the case when the multiparty quantum correlation is quantified by the ggm .",
    "the two subsequent subsections deal with the cases when the measure is respectively the tangle and the discord monogamy score .",
    "let us consider three parties , alice , bob , and charu . in this tripartite scenario",
    ", we will analytically derive a complementarity relation between the ggm and quantum advantage in multiport dense coding for all three - qubit pure states .",
    "moreover , we will show that the non - trivial boundary of this inequality is traced by the following single - parameter family of three - qubit states : @xmath64 is assumed to be real .",
    "note that the state displayed in eq .",
    "( [ boundarystate ] ) is not normalized to unity .",
    "we call this one - parameter family of quantum states as the mdcc family . three - qubit pure states are known to be the union of two disjoint classes , viz . the ghz - class and the w - class , which can not be reached from each other by stochastic local quantum operations and classical communication @xcite ( cf .",
    ". they can be distinguished by the values of their tangles , with the ghz - class states having a ( non - zero ) positive tangle and the w - class states having a zero tangle .",
    "we find that the tangle of the above state is always positive except at @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "hence the state @xmath66 belongs to the ghz - class except the point @xmath65 which belongs to the w - class .",

    "moreover , the boundary is again obtained for the mdcc family of three - qubit states .",

    "<S> a complementarity relation is established between the capacity of multiport classical information transmission via quantum states and multiparty quantum correlation measures for three - qubit pure states . </S>",
    "<S> the multiparty quantum correlation measures considered are the generalized geometric measure , the tangle , and the discord monogamy score . </S>",
    "<S> the complementarity relation is revealed by the identification of a one - parameter family of pure three - qubit states , which we call the maximally dense coding capable family of states . </S>",
