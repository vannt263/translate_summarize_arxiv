    "a krein space @xmath3 is a hilbert space equipped with an indefinite sesquilinear form given by a self - adjoint unitary operator @xmath0 . a bounded linear operator @xmath4 on @xmath3 conserving this form in the sense that @xmath5 is called @xmath0-unitary .",
    "the set of @xmath0-unitary operators forms a group and its lie algebra is the set of the @xmath0-hermitian operators , namely all bounded linear operators @xmath6 on @xmath3 satisfying @xmath7 .",
    "these two classes of operators can be considered as the equivalent of the unitary and hermitian operators on a hilbert space , a major difference being though that neither the @xmath0-unitaries nor the @xmath0-hermitian operators are necessarily normal .",
    "the two classes are further linked via the cayley transform .",
    "krein spaces as well as @xmath0-unitary and @xmath0-hermitian operators thereon have been studied by numerous authors since the 1950 s and this is well - documented in the two monographs @xcite .",
    "their spectra have reflection properties on the unit circle and the real axis respectively .",
    "a further important element of the theory of such operators are the krein signatures of eigenvalues on the unit circle @xmath8 or the real axis @xmath9 , given by the signature of @xmath0 restricted to the associated generalized eigenspaces .",
    "definite signatures imply stability of the eigenvalues , namely they can not leave the circle or the real line under perturbations . in prior works @xcite such signatures",
    "were mainly considered for finite dimensional krein spaces such as the classical groups u@xmath10 and sp@xmath11 , but in @xcite one of the authors thoroughly analyzed krein signatures for infinite dimensional krein spaces .",
    "this paper considers certain classes of fredholm operators on krein spaces .",
    "let us first focus on @xmath0-hermitian operators .",
    "the adequate fredholm property for them is to require @xmath12 to be a conventional fredholm operator for all @xmath13 .",
    "such @xmath0-hermitian operators will be called @xmath9-fredholm ( definition  [ def - essr ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the real spectrum of such operators consists of only a finite number of eigenvalues with finite multiplicity ( theorem  [ theo - g = f ] ) .",
    "hence these operators can rightfully also be called essentially hyperbolic . a global homotopy invariant on the set of @xmath0-hermitian @xmath9-fredholm operators",
    "is then given by the sum of the krein signatures over all real eigenvalues ( definition  [ def - sigg ] and theorem  [ theo - connected ] ) .",
    "the global signature invariant replaces the noether index ( often referred to as fredholm index ) in the sense that it labels the connected components of the @xmath0-hermitian @xmath9-fredholm operators .",
    "in fact , the latter set can be contracted to the fredholm operators so that the global signature generalizes the noether index to a wider class of operators ( theorem  [ theo - homotopy ] ) .    in a second step ,",
    "we consider krein spaces with real structures in a spirit similar to atiyah and singer @xcite ( definition  [ def - realkrein ] ) and then implement these symmetries on the @xmath14-unitary and @xmath14-hermitian operators ( definition  [ def - realunitaryhermitian ] ) .",
    "the large letter r is part of the notation and refers to atiyah @xcite who introduced real @xmath15-theory to analyze vector bundles that are invariant under a real symmetry . in the finite dimensional case",
    ", this leads to four classical groups as subgroups of u@xmath10 ( see section  [ sec - groups ] ) . for the @xmath0-hermitian @xmath9-fredholm operators",
    ", the real symmetry leads to restrictions on the values of the global signature and furthermore to the definition of secondary @xmath2-invariants ( theorem  [ theo - connectedreal ] ) .",
    "the collision scenarios of eigenvalues studied to show that these invariants are well - defined are also of interest in the finite dimensional cases . in particular , for the classical group o@xmath10 a so - called mediated tangent bifurcation is generic and has not been studied elsewhere to our best knowledge . for the infinite dimensional case",
    "it is then again shown that the four new classes of @xmath0-hermitian @xmath9-fredholm operators with real symmetry can be retracted to four of the atiyah - singer classifying spaces for real @xmath15-theory @xcite ( theorem  [ theo - connectedreal ] and corollary  [ coro - atiyahsinger ] ) .",
    "for @xmath0-unitary operators , it is natural to require that @xmath8 only contains discrete spectrum , namely to consider the essentially @xmath8-gapped @xmath0-unitaries ( definition  [ def - esss1 ] ) .",
    "this is strictly stronger than imposing @xmath16 to be fredholm for all @xmath17 .",
    "the subtle difference results from the non - normality of the operators involved . on the set of essentially @xmath8-gapped @xmath0-unitaries",
    "the global signature is again a homotopy invariant ( theorem  [ theo - siginv ] ) .",
    "this is already discussed in @xcite and is briefly reviewed in section  [ sec - unitaries ] .",
    "new is , however , the analysis of ( secondary ) invariants for essentially @xmath8-gapped @xmath0-unitaries with real symmetries ( theorem  [ the - realinvariants ] ) .",
    "it is _ not _ shown that these invariants are complete invariants in the sense that they label the connected components .",
    "indeed , this may not be true . in section",
    "[ sec - unbounded ] we conjecture that at least for unbounded @xmath0-unitaries without real symmetries ( called @xmath0-isometries as in @xcite ) such a labelling by the global signature is valid",
    ".    all the above results are not only of functional analytic interest , but are helpful and relevant for applications of index theory whenever an indefinite sesquilinear form is present .",
    "in fact , the augmented flexibility of the new classes of fredholm operators with global signatures may then allow to directly define analytic invariants .",
    "an example of such a situation , actually motivating the present work , are the transfer operators for two - dimensional tight - binding models for solid state physics restricted to a half - space .",
    "the krein signatures are then interpreted as the chiralities of the associated boundary states ( see section  6.8 of @xcite ) . in this framework , the real symmetries are inherited from physical symmetries of topological insulators .",
    "these examples will be studied in detail in a forthcoming work .",
    "preliminary results can be found in @xcite .",
    "* acknowledgements : * this work considerably extends the mathematical sections of our previous preprint @xcite .",
    "part of the results on @xmath0-hermitian @xmath9-fredholm operators were obtained in collaboration with stefan daiker during his master thesis in erlangen in 2014 .",
    "we thank pappit - unam in 104015 as well as the dfg for financial support .",
    "let us recall @xcite that a krein space @xmath3 is a separable complex hilbert space endowed with a fundamental symmetry , namely a selfadjoint unitary @xmath0 on @xmath3 . in an adequate basis ,",
    "the fundamental symmetry takes the form @xmath18 however , the particular choice of basis will be irrelevant for most arguments in the following .",
    "the inertia of @xmath0 will be denoted by @xmath19 , that is @xmath20 is the multiplicity of @xmath21 as eigenvalue of @xmath0",
    ". we will mainly be interested in the case @xmath22 .",
