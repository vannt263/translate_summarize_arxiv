    "panel ( a ) and ( b ) refer to the np case , while ( c ) and ( d ) refer to scp .",
    "the main modulation in the i - v characteristic happens in the flux interval @xmath185 $ ] , for which the weak link is in the gapped state .",
    "the main differences between the np and scp is the presence in the latter of a permanent voltage gap and peaks due to the superconducting probe .",
    "the y - logarithmic plots on the right column give a clearer insight on the modulation properties .",
    "the i - v characteristics are modulated in a voltage range of @xmath186 corresponding to a swing in current of few order of magnitude that can further increase by lowering @xmath187 .",
    "considering an electrical setup where the @xmath0-squipt is biased with a proper current @xmath188 , the voltage drop depends on flux , giving the flux to voltage characteristics @xmath189 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "the optimal voltage - gap swing @xmath186 can be approached at low current bias , making the @xmath0-squipt a low power dissipation magnetometer . in figure",
    "[ fig : f2v_scp ] on the left side the flux to voltage characteristics @xmath189 is plotted for two representative devices with @xmath94 and @xmath92 in the case of both np and scp .",
    "the main modulation interval is @xmath190 $ ] ( with @xmath81 periodicity ) ; on the contrary , the interval @xmath191 $ ] has a flat trend .",
    "the performance of the device as a magnetometer can be estimated by the flux to voltage transfer function @xmath192 the @xmath183 function is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2v_scp ] on the right side .",
    "the performance in terms of magnetometry of the @xmath0-squipt is 3.8@xmath193 for @xmath94 and 4.3@xmath193 for @xmath92 .",
    "we note that these performances are lower than those of a conventional squipt .",
    "indeed , for sake of comparison it is sufficient to consider the total flux on the device .",
    "the total flux interval of the main modulation is from zero to the closure of the induced minigap . in the squipt ,",
    "the minigap closes at @xmath194 ; in a @xmath0-squipt , the gap closes at total flux @xmath195 , that is greater than the squipt case .",
    "this means that a certain swing in the output signal requires a greater flux variation in the @xmath0-squipt , lowering then its sensitivity .    nevertheless , the @xmath0-squipt has also interesting gradiometric properties .",
    "let us consider the region around the fluxes point @xmath196 in the @xmath197 plot for full symmetric @xmath0-squipt ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_vs_in ] ) . along the diagonal line @xmath198 ,",
    "the modulation is smaller with respect to other directions . in particular",
    ", it reaches the maximum value for @xmath199 .",
    "hence , the sensitivity is greater for magnetic fields with a spatial gradient .",
    "gradiometric properties are exploited for magnetic measurement protected from noise caused by far source@xcite .",
    "-squipt as a magnetometer . here",
    "the interfaces are asymmetric , with @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "panel ( a ) presents the dos at fermi energy @xmath197 as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "panel ( b ) dos of the @xmath0-squipt at fermi energy @xmath197 in the case of equal fluxes @xmath202 ( orange solid line ) . for sake of comparison we plot also",
    "the result in the case of a conventional two - terminal device ( dark red dashed curve ) with equal contact resistances @xmath203.,width=321 ]    finally , we comment on a different possible application of the @xmath0-squipt as a magnetometer .",
    "basically , this possibility relies on the shape of the dos at fermi energy of the three - terminal jj .",
    "consider , for example , an @xmath0-squipt whose s / n resistances are asymmetric with @xmath200 and @xmath201 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : skew_mag ] . in this case , the shape of the dos at fermi energy @xmath197 is skewed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skew_mag ] ) . a symmetric flux that goes from @xmath204 to @xmath205 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skew_mag ] , white line in panel ( a ) ) crosses the red conductive region in three different points . in these crossing points",
    ", the dos at fermi energy shows peaks depending on the flux @xmath79 .",
    "the strong modulation of @xmath197 can be exploited for magnetometry .",
    "notice that here , the experimental setup should be different from the current biased setup discussed above .",
    "for example , a lock - in configuration that measures the differential conductance at zero voltage can be used .",
    "panel ( b ) of fig.[fig : skew_mag ] shows the cuts of the dos at fermi energy for equal fluxes in the asymmetric configuration with @xmath200 and @xmath201 ( orange solid line ) . for sake of comparison",
    "we have also plotted the analogous quantity for a conventional squipt@xcite with opacities @xmath203 ( dark red dashed curve ) .",
    "as one can argue from the figure , also the two - terminal device can be used as a magnetometer , since it presents a peaked structure around @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "the inset depicts a magnification in the region near @xmath119 , showing that the peak is sharper in the case of a conventional squipt .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0-squipt has also other intervals of modulation in @xmath206 and @xmath207 , demonstrating that it has a larger region of working points as a magnetometer .",
    "in summary , the paper reports an exaustive theoretical investigation of different coherent transport properties of a three - terminal hybrid device , the so - called @xmath0-squipt . by means of a full numerical solution of the usadel equation , extended to the case of three s leads , we have studied the effects on the proximized metallic nanowire of the length , the inelastic scattering and the quality of the s / n interfaces .",
    "we have shown that the spectral properties are an useful tool to identify transitions between gapless and gapped states in this three - terminal setup .",
    "the induced supercurrents in the different arms of the device are discussed in detail , showing that these can be an alternative allmark of non - trivial topological properties .",
    "the quasi - particle transport properties through a metallic probe tunnel - coupled to the josephson junction are presented both in the case of a metallic and a superconducting probe . since the @xmath0-squipt is sensitive to magnetic fluxes ,",
    "we have inspected its magnetometric features , finding that this device can have potential applications as a gradiometer or magnetometer . finally , we emphasize that the theoretical results reported here can serve as a starting point for a better fundamental understanding of multi - terminal jjs which recently have drawn great interest due to their exotic properties and potential applications in quantum computing .
