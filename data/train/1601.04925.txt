    "manipulating spin degrees of freedom of electrons in addition to charge degrees is at the forefront of current materials science @xcite . by utilizing the spin hall effect ( she ) @xcite and the inverse spin hall effect ( ishe)@xcite ,",
    "a variety of novel phenomena are envisioned @xcite .",
    "for example , the spin current in magnetic materials can be generated by the temperature gradient , the spin seebeck effect ( sse ) @xcite .",
    "unlike the conventional seebeck effect , the sse also exists in magnetic insulators ( mis ) @xcite in which the spin current is mediated by spin waves or magnons .",

    "further , magnetic excitations can be used for the transmission of the electrical signal through mis @xcite .",
    "conventionally , these phenomena have been analyzed based on excitations or fluctuations from magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies demonstrate such phenomena even above magnetic transition temperatures : spin current generation @xcite and the sse @xcite .",
    "thus , a new or extended concept which does not require magnetic ordering needs to be developed .",
    "once this is established , it would extend the current scope of spintronics , allowing for example the transmission of electrical signals through _ paramagnetic insulators _",
    "( pm insulators or pmis ) mediated by some form of magnetic fluctuations , which is appealing for both fundamental science and applications because it allows the transport of magnetic quanta for efficient information technologies . in this paper , we provide a simple description of the performance of a pmi / nomal metal ( nm ) interface by evaluating the spin current through the interface and the spin current conductance inside the pmi using auxiliary particle ( ap ) methods , some of which allow access to both pm and magnetic states . we find that the spin current injection at a pmi / nm interface is sensitive to temperature below a magnetic transition temperature @xmath0 [ @xmath1 for ferromagnet ( fm ) and @xmath2 for afm ] but weakly dependent on temperatures above @xmath0 .",
    "the spin conductance due to magnetic fluctuations is found to be maximized around @xmath0 .",

    "our main focus is on the finite temperature properties of a simple model , not exotic properties at low temperatures such as spin liquids .",

    "_ spin conductivity_. the performance of devices consisting of a mi connected with nm electrodes does not only depend on the spin current injection discussed in the previous section but also on how injected spins transfer inside the mi or from one electrode to the other electrode through the mi .",

    "further , we focused on the universal behavior of pmi described by both bosonic and fermionic aps , which do not necessarily have a fermi surface .",
    "in contrast to metal- or semiconductor - based magnetic interfaces as widely discussed in the literature @xcite , mi / nm interfaces do not necessarily accompany the charge accumulation inside a magnetic region when injecting or extracting spins . instead ,",

    "<S> we also analyze the bulk spin conductance . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the conductance becomes zero at zero temperature as predicted by linear spin wave theory but increases with temperature and is maximized around the magnetic transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these findings suggest that the compromise between the two effects determines the optimal temperature for spintronics applications utilizing magnetic insulators . </S>"
