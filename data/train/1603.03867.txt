    "these biological functions have neuronal basis and are a reflection of emergent properties of signal dynamics over the network .",

    "the key role of distance constraint in shaping the architecture of complex networks has been well studied and highlighted  @xcite .",
    "the _ c. elegans _ neuronal system could be modelled as a network and studied for structural properties of its neuronal architecture as well as for network dynamics  (  [ fig : cenn_network ] ) .",
    "graph theoretical studies provide important insights into evolutionary mechanisms of this system and enable biological inference .",

    "the network , comprising of 277 neurons that are interlinked with 2105 synapses , has been studied for its broad structural features as well as towards identification of motifs that potentially contribute to the dynamics over the network .",
    "using graph theoretical measures , cenn has been observed to have a small world architecture with small path length and high clustering  @xcite .",
    "one of the mechanisms by which interconnected systems acquire small world nature is by having modules densely connected with short - range connections , which are further interlinked through long - range connections  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that such connectivity pattern may emerge due to processes that leave the network critically poised between absolute order and extreme randomness .",
    "the small world nature may render this neural network ( as well as other neuronal systems ) efficient for information dynamics . such a topology is known to offer evolutionary advantage by optimized wiring in neuronal systems  @xcite .",

    "ffms have been suggested to be of functional relevance to biological systems such as transcriptional regulatory networks  @xcite .",
    "one of the possible utilities ascribed to these structural building blocks is control of signal regulation in response to persistent input .",
    "how exactly such building blocks may offer functional advantage to neuronal networks and whether these entities have evolved to optimize the building blocks is not clearly understood yet .",
    "control systems approach to complex networks provides a better perspective of dynamics over the network and ability to steer its ` state '  @xcite .",
    "neuronal architecture of cenn forms an important underlying framework which specifies phenotypic features of _ c.  elegans_. important behavioral traits as well as cognitive processes ( such as movement , sensation , egg laying , mechanosensation , chemosensation and memory ) are known to have neuronal basis .",
    "a network is said to be controllable if it can be reached to a desired state from any initial state by providing inputs to certain nodes  @xcite .",
    "the set of nodes that facilitate such a control are named driver nodes  @xcite .    by studying genotypic and phenotypic aspects of cenn ,",
    "in our earlier study we have shown that ` driver neurons ' are associated with important biological functions such as reproduction , signalling processes and anatomical structural development  @xcite .",
    "going by their relevance to structural controllability , driver neurons are expected to be important in dictating the state of the network . in _ c. elegans _",
    "driver neurons are primarily of short span and linked to motor activities  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , randomized controls have no driver neurons as compared to cenn which presents a sizeable number of driver neurons that are crucial for its control .",
    "while earlier studies have shown that connectivity of neurons in cenn partially explains the observed number of driver neurons  @xcite , no model has so far been developed that accounts for its small world architecture , over - representation of ffms as well as controllability .    in this study , we create one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) network models of _ c. elegans _ neuronal system to investigate the role of ffms as building blocks in conferring controllability and small world nature . with the help of a simple 1d ring model",
    "we show such a network is critically poised for the number of ffms , neuronal clustering and characteristic path - length in response to synaptic rewiring , indicating optimal rewiring .",
    "we found that synaptic connections between neurons are characterized with a strong distance constraint in cenn . using this as a guiding principle",
    ", we created a distance constrained synaptic plasticity model that simultaneously explains small world nature , ffm saturation and controllability of the network .",
    "this model could account for the number of driver neurons observed in cenn .",
    "moreover , the nodes that act as driver neurons in this model match with those obtained from empirical network with high accuracy . thus the model highlights realistic process of distance constrained synaptic plasticity as a plausible basis of nature of functional sub - structures and controllability observed in cenn .",
    "the nervous system of _ c. elegans _ consists of 277 neurons ( barring the pharyngeal neurons ) which are interconnected via electrical and chemical synapses  @xcite .",
    "we constructed cenn , a graph theoretic model of _ c. elegans _ neuronal network , comprising of 277 somatic neurons and 2105 synaptic connections .",
    "multiple synaptic connections between two neurons were merged to yield a simple directed unweighted graph in which neurons represent nodes and synaptic connections are links .",
    "a typical neuron in cenn on an average had @xmath0 synaptic connections .",
    "we calculated following graph theoretical properties of the network embodying clustering , compactness , structural motifs and controllability of the network .      clustering coefficient of a node @xmath1 is defined as ratio of number of triangles ( triangle refers to a three node clique ) made by a node with its neighbours to the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by them  @xcite . for a graph @xmath2 the clustering coefficient of a node @xmath3",
    "is defined as follows :    @xmath4    here , @xmath5 refers to the neighbourhood of node @xmath3 and @xmath6 represents its connectivity ( degree ) .",
    "the average clustering coefficient ( @xmath7 ) was calculated by averaging clustering coefficients of all @xmath8 nodes :      characteristic path - length  ( @xmath9 ) enumerates compactness , reflecting ease of information transfer , of the network .",
    "it is defined as the average of shortest path - lengths among all pairs of nodes in the network .",
    "@xmath10      network motifs are defined as patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks  @xcite . in a three node digraph @xmath11",
    "different types of three node motifs can exist .",
    "angular motifs are linear three node sub - structures , and triangular motifs comprise of three nodes inter - connected with either unidirectional or bidirectional edges . for our studies , we computed number of feed forward motifs , @xmath12 , ( among unidirectional triangular motifs ) that are prevalent in many real world networks including cenn  @xcite .",

    ", driver nodes in a network are those nodes which when controlled by an external input can provide full control over the state of the network  @xcite .",

    "we constructed two random controls of cenn viz .",

    "the model exhibits a spectrum of topological variations between extreme regularity and randomness .",
    "the figure shows an illustration for 10 nodes and 2 outgoing edges .",

    "we constructed a ring graph model of cenn so as to maximise the number of ffms while preserving the number of neurons @xmath16 as well as average neuronal connectivity @xmath17 of cenn  (  [ fig : regular_graph ] ) .",
    "while the core idea and strategy implemented in this model is analogous to that of watts and strogatz s  @xcite , it is extended to represent directed edges ( synapses ) , and hence naturally accommodates network motifs and controllability analysis .",
    "starting with @xmath18 nodes arranged in a circular manner , every node was connected ( in anti - clockwise sense ) to its next nearest neighbour with a directed edge .",
    "the procedure was repeated to connect every node with its nearest neighbour and the next nearest neighbour until the out - degree of every node matched with that of average out - degree of cenn @xmath19 .",
    "this strategy maximises the number of ffms to @xmath20 in the regular graph model of cenn and represents an asymptotic version saturated with ffms .    to mimic random synaptic plasticity in this simple 1d model",
    ", we rewired every edge in this network with a certain ` probability of rewiring ( @xmath21 ) ' .",
    "every out - going edge connecting a node to its nearest neighbour was chosen and rewired randomly with probability @xmath21 by ensuring that there were no duplicate edges or self - edges and that the network is always connected . in the second lap",
    ", the process was repeated for the edges made with next - nearest neighbours and so on .",

    "response of dcr model was observed by varying the value of exponent between @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast to dcr model , the underlying framework for dcp model is that of dd control which preserves the synaptic connectivity of each neuron .",
    "starting with dd control , every edge was rewired to impose distance constraint for specific exponent @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and statistics of topological parameters were computed over 100 instances .      the deterministic cartesian graph model of cenn was created by ensuring that every neuron is connected to its spatially nearest neurons . beginning with @xmath35 277 neurons placed at cartesian coordinates matching their observed position in the nervous system of _ c. elegans _",
    "@xcite , every neuron was connected to @xmath36 8 spatially nearest neurons .",
    "this model reflects preferential deterministic connections made by a neuron based on its distance from another neuron .      using maximum matching algorithm  @xcite ,",
