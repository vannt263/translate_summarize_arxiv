    "massive stars exercise a profound influence over the baryonic component of the universe , through the return of ionizing radiation , and via supernovae ( sne ) , kinetic energy and metal - enriched gas , back into the interstellar medium ( ism ) from which they form  usually called `` feedback '' .",
    "feedback influences gas - phase conditions in the immediate environment of the clusters within which the massive stars form @xcite , on galactic scales the phase structure and energetics of the ism @xcite , and on multi - mpc scales the thermodynamics and enrichment of the inter - galactic medium ( igm  e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "the vast range of spatial scales involved is only one of the difficulties encountered in attempting to study feedback . restricting the discussion to purely mechanical feedback from sne and stellar winds ( commonly termed sn feedback )",
    ", a further difficulty is the broad range of complicated gas - phase physics ",
    "( magneto)hydrodynamic effects such as shocks and turbulence , thermal conduction , and non - ionization equilibrium emission processes .",
    "a final complication is that much of the energy and metal - enriched material involved is in the hard - to - observe coronal ( @xmath5 k ) and hot ( @xmath6 k ) gas phases , necessitating the use of space - based fuv and x - ray telescopes .",
    "x - ray observations of the halo - regions of nearby edge - on disk galaxies provide the best single probe of the action of mechanical feedback on the galactic scale . optical spectroscopy and imaging , sensitive to warm neutral and ionized gas with @xmath7 k ,",
    "are a less direct probe of mechanical feedback as much of the excitation energy is supplied by ionizing radiation from massive stars ( radiative feedback ) , even when the kinematics and spatial distribution of this gas are controlled by sn feedback . if mechanical feedback processes transport mass , newly - synthesized metals , and energy from galaxies into the igm , then this material must pass through the halo of the host galaxy on its way into the igm , where its properties can be ascertained before it expands and fades into observational invisibility .",
    "diffuse thermal x - ray emission is seen to extend to large distances ( @xmath8 to 20 kpc ) above the planes of edge - on _ starburst _ galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , which also show unambiguous optical emission line evidence for energetic galactic scale outflows  `` superwinds '' @xcite .",
    "these outflows are potentially very significant in enriching and heating the igm @xcite .",
    "both fully - numerical and semi - analytical theoretical modeling @xcite suggest that the properties of the gaseous halos these superwinds expand into play a major role in determining the fate of the material in superwinds ( i.e. escape into the igm , or confinement and eventual return to the disk ) .",
    "although simulations of starburst - driven winds should be treated with caution , given the lack of calibration against observational data , one robust result is the sensitivity of the wind properties ( in particular mass and metal loss to the igm ) on the disk and halo ism properties ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our view , the emphasis given to galactic mass as a primary parameter influencing gas and metal ejection efficiencies ( e.g.   * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) blinds non - expert readers to the more fundamental role played by the poorly - known disk and halo ism distributions .",
    "the gravitational potential only enters at a secondary level , by influencing the gas distribution and finally via the escape velocity .",
    "redressing the lack of observational knowledge about the gaseous halos that superwinds must pass through is one motivation for studying the halos of _ normal _ star - forming galaxies .",
    "modern theories of the ism in normal spiral galaxies also predict hot gas in the halo , due to the interchange of material between the disk and halo through `` galactic fountains '' @xcite , or in a more - localized form through `` chimneys '' @xcite .",
    "energy feed back into the ism from supernovae is believed to create bubbles of hot , metal - enriched , gas , which blow out of the disk and vent their contents into the halo of the galaxy .",
    "after @xmath9 years or so , this material cools and falls back to the disk , possibly in a form analogous to the galactic high velocity clouds .    unfortunately , many of the fundamental aspects of these fountain / chimney disk / halo interaction theories are observationally unconstrained , fundamentally due to our _ current _ lack of knowledge about the x - ray properties of spiral galaxy halos . in the theoretical paradigm ,",
    "fountains are primarily driven by the over - pressurized hot gas created by sne , and the most direct diagnostic of the energetics , and elemental composition , of this gas is the thermal x - ray emission it produces .",
    "studies of nearby edge - on star - forming galaxies with _ einstein _ and the _ rosat pspc _ revealed _ only one _ normal spiral , ngc 891 @xcite , with x - ray - emitting gas in its halom flux ratio , high h@xmath10  luminosity and optically disturbed morphology show that it is a highly atypical spiral galaxy .",
    "it is a good example of a galaxy experiencing a mild , disk - wide , starburst event @xcite .",
    "we believe that the _ rosat _ pspc - based detection of a @xmath11 diffuse x - ray halo around ngc 4565 , claimed by @xcite , is incorrect , as the archival 2.9 ksec _",
    "acis - s observation ( obsid 404 ) reveals that the x - ray emission @xmath12 east of the nucleus ( that comprised the majority of the emission originally considered to be diffuse ) is due to two point sources . ] . although edge - on normal spiral galaxies did not receive as much attention with _",
    "einstein _ & _ rosat _ as other classes of galaxy , those observations that were performed failed to produce believable detections of hot halo gas in other edge - on normal star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "x - ray studies of our own galaxy s halo and disk / halo interface ( e.g. @xcite ) provide information complementary to the study of other galaxies , but are difficult to perform and interpret due to our location within the disk .",
    "more progress on investigating the disk / halo interface in normal galaxies has been made at other wavelengths , primarily in the optical , where extra - planar h@xmath10  emission ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and dust @xcite has been detected in a variety of nearby , normal spiral galaxies .",
    "these studies have shown that the presence of such tracers of disk / halo interaction increases with higher levels of star - formation intensity in the underlying disk , but the mechanisms behind these phenomena , and their energetics , are still unclear .",
    "it is also not clear to what extent fountains are a distinct phenomenon from superwinds .",
    "it is not unreasonable to think that physical conditions and kinematics of the gas making up a fountain may be quite different from that in a superwinds , despite the general similarity in driving mechanism . for example , the filling factor of the dominant x - ray - emitting plasma might be high in a fountain @xcite , as compared to superwinds where the filling factor is low @xcite .",
    "another intriguingly hint of a difference comes from the _ rosat _ pspc - based sample of both normal spiral galaxies and starburst galaxies of all inclinations by @xcite .",
    "they find that the x - ray - emitting gas `` in the coronal systems [ _ i.e .",
    "_ galaxies assumed to have a hydrostatic hot gas corona / halo ] appears to be cooler than that seen in the wind systems [ _ i.e .  _ starburst galaxies with superwinds ] '' .",
    "practitioners of semi - analytical ( e.g. @xcite ) , and numerical cosmological models ( e.g. @xcite ) of galaxy formation and evolution offer a radically different origin for x - ray emitting halos around spiral galaxies .",
    "inter - galactic gas continually flows into galactic halos , is heated in an accretion shock to the halo virial temperature ( although @xcite discuss simulations in which only a small fraction of the accreted gas is heated to halo virial temperatures ) , and then cools and accretes onto the disk .",
    "these models predict red - shift zero spiral galaxy x - ray luminosities at , or just below , the _ rosat_-based observational upper limits .",
    "the predicted x - ray luminosity is a strong function of the galaxy mass , @xmath13 , and that the temperature of the gas is similar to the halo virial temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the majority of the diffuse x - ray emission arises close to the disk , the x - ray surface brightness dropping off semi - exponentially with height above the disk .",
    "these halo properties should be largely independent of the host disk s sf intensity , and the exact numerical implementation of sn feedback ( j. sommer - larsen , 2002 , private communication ) .",

    "however , if we use @xmath120 instead , then galaxies with @xmath322 sn myr@xmath130 kpc@xmath132 appear to have disk blow out , apparently in good agreement with blow out theory .    in summary , although it is relatively easy to empirically determine that a galaxy has blown hot gas out of the disk into the halo , a quantitative comparison to theory is much more difficult . with the present uncertainties it is not clear whether the energy requirements for superbubble blow out that the standard theory predicts ( with or without allowing for collective energy return from multiple clusters ) are accurate , even to within an order of magnitude .",
    "more theoretical and observational study is required before we can meaningfully test superbubble blow out theory :    1 .",
    "x - ray observations must be deep enough to rule out significant amount of hot gas in the halos of low sf rate galaxies , so that we can be certain that blow out from the disk has not occurred ( see   [ sec : discussion : mass_or_sf : rates ] ) .",
    "observational estimates of star formation or supernova rates per unit area should ideally use spatially resolved estimates of the star formation rate , and more importantly , observed disk gaseous scale heights ( see   [ sec : discussion : blow_out : interact ] ) .",
    "we need more theoretical study of the energetic efficiencies of mechanical feedback in clusters and in the realistic multi - phase ism , in order to understand how @xmath157 and @xmath276 depend on the star formation intensity and local ism properties ( see   [ sec : discussion : blow_out : therm_effic ] ) .      much of the preceding discussion as revolved around the blow out of superbubbles from the disk of normal star forming galaxies .",
    "we now wish to briefly turn to the issue of ejection of hot , metal - enriched , gas into the igm from starburst - driven superwinds .",
    "material blowing out from the disk does not automatically escape into the igm , as it must work against the obstacle provided by gas in the halo before being able to reach the igm , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .    based on the observed x - ray surface brightness profiles of the extra - planar emission of the galaxies within this sample ,",
    "it is appropriate to represent the original halo gas distribution as an exponential with density scale height @xmath105 ",
    "@xmath323 kpc , _",
    "i.e.  _ twice the observed surface brightness scale height .",
    "note that optical studies of the extra - planar emission from warm ionized gas in normal and some starburst galaxies also indicate exponential gas distributions with very similar scale heights @xcite .",
    "for such a stratified halo gas distribution the standard superbubble blow out energy requirements can be applied ( this time with respect to halo blow out ) to any bubble or wind that manages to blow out of the disk .",
    "simulations of superwinds clearly show that the halo medium is swept - up into a new shell surrounding the hot gas vented from the disk @xcite .",
    "we will assume that superbubble blow out theory is correct for the remainder of this section .",
    "note that this directly implies that the critical region of space around a galaxy that can prevent escape into the igm is within @xmath324 ( @xmath325  24 kpc ) of the mid - plane , a region that can be probed by existing observational methods .",
    "we need not concern ourselves about the density and pressure of gas at larger , @xmath1 kpc , distances from the host galaxy .",
    "we can now apply the arguments of   [ sec : discussion : blow_out ] to halo blow out .",
    "the proportionality between the halo region x - ray flux and the iras fir flux ( and hence the _ total _ galactic sf rate ) strongly suggests that the halo can draw on mechanical energy from a significant fraction of the entire star - forming disk .",
    "if the sn rate per unit area in the disk is sufficient to blow out from the disk , then the collective blow - out model can be applied to the hot gas now in the halo . the appropriate scale height",
    "to use is that of the halo gas density distribution @xmath326 , either directly measured from the x - ray data or estimated using empirical results of ",
    "[ sec : discussion : mass_or_sf : sizes ] .",
    "there we showed that @xmath327 ( or the k - band half light radius @xmath117 ) .",
    "thus the appropriate mean supernova rate per unit area @xmath185 to calculate for assessing halo blow out is proportional to @xmath328 .",
    "the only significant differences from the case of assessing disk blow out are then as follows :    1 .",
    "the appropriate density and pressure are that of the halo , evaluated at the galactic mid - plane ( e.g.  see @xcite ) . for typical galactic environments now and at high redshift , the density and pressure of any bound , non - transient , halo medium will be less than those in disk .",
    "the additional energy losses during disk blow must be accounted for . in the starbursts",
    ", a good case can be made that radiative losses are negligible , based both on the observational lack of significant x - ray , and optical emission @xcite . in the high resolution hydrodynamical simulation of @xcite @xmath329% of the mechanical energy injected within the disk is transported into the halo .",
    "3 .   when considering blow out from the halo it is appropriate to use a sn rate averaged over the characteristic size of the host galaxy , not just the main star forming region . for comparison to eqn .",
    "[ equ : fcrit ] a good estimate of @xmath185 would be @xmath330 or @xmath331 , given the correlations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sizes_sizes1 ] .",
    "making full use of this to assess blow out from the halos of galaxies requires that we know the critical sn rate per unit area for disk blow out . nevertheless , with an observationally - calibrated theory of this sort it will be possible to assess whether gas can blow out into the igm .",
    "what this analysis does indicate is that extended gaseous halos around normal star - forming galaxies ( excluding galaxies in dense gaseous environments such as clusters ) do not automatically prevent outflows from reaching the igm .",
    "the total power requirements for blowing out of a gaseous halo will more somewhat more exacting than for simply blowing gas out of the disk , but this is not surprising , nor a significant problem given the sn rates in nuclear starbursts .",
    "nevertheless the most important point we wish readers to extract from this discussion is that the critical region of space around a galaxy that can prevent escape into the igm is most probably within @xmath324 ( @xmath325  24 kpc ) of the mid - plane , which is a region well probed by existing observational methods .",
    "unambiguous observational proof of ejection of material into the igm by outflows requires kinematic evidence of outward motion at @xmath332 at heights @xmath333 above the mid - plane of the host galaxy ( where @xmath334 is the escape velocity at that location , and not the escape velocity from the center of the halo , and @xmath326 is the density scale height of the gaseous halo ) , and preferably the summed thermal and kinetic energy , must be assessed on a phase - by - phase basis . the cool shell velocity ( as used by , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the temperature of the x - ray emitting plasma ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are not particularly meaningful tools for assessing whether gas will be retained .",
    "the energy per particle in the hot phases is much greater than that of the cool shell material , and it is likely that the kinetic energy of the x - ray - emitting hot gas can exceed its thermal energy several times @xcite . ] .",
    "this is observationally challenging , especially given that the most interesting , _",
    "i.e.  _ metal - enriched , gas phases are very tenuous , and very hot and highly ionized . such observations , even of the denser phases , are unlikely to be accomplished for many years .",
    "nevertheless , what the theoretically - and - observationally motivated argument in the preceding section demonstrates is that it is _ likely _ that starburst galaxies , even ones as massive as @xmath335 , and possibly some normal spiral galaxies , do eject material into the igm .",
    "this is consistent with the effective yields and metal - loss scenario presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "put another way , we regard escape as an eminently plausible fate for at least some fraction of the material in superwinds , as currently _ there are no convincing theoretically or observationally - motivated ways to absolutely prevent escape_.",
    "making use of the detailed measurements of the diffuse x - ray emitting gas in and around the sample of seven starburst and three normal edge - on spiral galaxies presented in paper i , we have investigated how the properties of this hot gas correlate with the size , mass , star formation rate and star formation intensity in the host galaxies .",
    "although not a large sample , these galaxies do span the full range of star formation activity found in spiral galaxies .",
    "the three normal spirals are too small a sample on their own to establish any hard conclusions about the properties of diffuse x - ray emission in normal spiral galaxies , but in combination with the starbursts we can make a meaningful initial assessment of how closely the properties of the diffuse x - ray emission in these systems resemble those of the edge - on starburst galaxies .    we demonstrate that the extra - planar ( _ i.e .  _ halo - region )",
    "diffuse x - ray emission in the starburst galaxies is ultimately driven by star formation activity within the disk , _",
    "i.e.  _ through starburst - driven superwinds . accretion of gas from the igm , or agn - driven winds ( see paper i ) , do not appear to be significant in this sample .",
    "considering both the starburst and normal spiral galaxies , larger galaxies show more radially and vertically extended diffuse x - ray emission , but beyond this correlation we find no evidence that galactic mass plays any part in determining the diffuse hot phase in the disks and halos of these galaxies .",
    "the extent of the diffuse x - ray emission parallel to the plane of the host galaxy correlates well with estimates of the extent of star formation within the disk , further evidence that the soft thermal x - ray emission is a result of mechanical energy feedback from massive stars .",
    "the vertical extent of the diffuse x - ray emission correlates best with the absolute size of the host galaxy , as if the emitting gas fills the halo .",
    "exponential scale heights are similar to those found in the extra - planar warm ionized gas from optical for samples of star forming disk galaxies .",
    "the luminosity of the diffuse x - ray emission , both within the disk and halo , is determined primarily by the rate of mechanical energy injection due to sne in each galaxy ( which is correlated to the star - formation rate ) .",
    "the surface brightness of the extra - planar diffuse x - ray emission correlates with the star formation rate per unit area in the underlying disk , but this correlation is a combination of the previously mentioned luminosity and size correlations .",
    "the properties of the diffuse x - ray emission in the normal spiral galaxies is very similar to that found in the starburst superwind galaxies .",
    "in fact , one could successfully predict the diffuse x - ray properties of all three normal galaxies in this sample based on extrapolating the x - ray properties of the starburst galaxies to the lower star formation intensities seen in the normal galaxies .",
    "the close similarity in the halo - region diffuse x - ray emission in the starburst ( with superwinds ) and the milky - way - like normal spiral ngc 891 ( most probably having a star - formation - fed galactic fountain ) is intriguing , and deserves more study .",
    "is it simply due to similar , micro - physical , emission mechanisms , or does the similarity extend to the macroscopic hydrodynamics at work over multi - kpc scales ?",
    "the current sample of edge - on normal spiral galaxies observed by _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ is small , so it is still possible that it is purely a coincidence that the three normal spirals we have studied lie on trends extrapolated from the starbursts . with the larger sample of observations available with next few years we should finally be able to typify the properties of diffuse thermal x - ray emission in normal spirals in the way we have with starburst galaxies .",
    "we also consider what the observed extra - planar diffuse x - ray emission can tell us about the both the efficiency of massive star mechanical feedback on galactic scales , and the accuracy of standard theoretical models of superbubble blow out from disk galaxies .",
    "we find the ratio of the halo - region diffuse x - ray flux to the host galaxy s total fir flux is typically @xmath336 , to within a factor two , for both the starburst galaxies and ngc 891 .",
    "this ratio is independent of the star formation rate per unit area or the mass of the host galaxy .",
    "it has long been clear that starburst - driven superwinds are powered by the collective mechanical energy input from massive stars within the entire starburst region .",
    "in contrast superbubble blow out from the disk ism of normal star forming galaxies is usually considered in the context of bubbles being powered by a single star cluster , in which only very rare , very massive , star clusters are powerful enough to drive a bubble that can blow out of a disk @xcite .",
    "we argue that there are a variety of good reasons to consider some level of cooperative or collective action between multiple clusters in normal star forming galaxies , _",
    "i.e.  _ when considering blow out of gas from the disk a significant fraction of all sn energy with a disk area @xmath337 can be used to blow a superbubble .",
    "we show that a minor generalization of the @xcite superbubble model to allow for such collective action directly predicts a critical star formation rate per unit area for superbubble blow out from the disk , a formulation particularly useful for comparison to observations of edge - on star forming galaxies .",
    "the standard theory of superbubble blow out developed by @xcite is widely used in astronomy , largely in relation to mass and metal loss from galaxies , but has had little in the way of observational testing .",
    "the presence of hot gas in the halo of a star forming galaxy is direct evidence for blow out of superbubbles from the disk of the host galaxy ( in cases where the emission can be shown to be related to sf activity in the underlying disk ) .",
    "further observational study of edge - on normal spiral galaxies in the ways presented in this paper , and in paper i , will allow empirical constraints to be made on the critical star formation rate per unit disk area necessary to blow hot gas out of the disk into the halo . in principle",
    "these empirical measurements could be used to test superbubble blow out theory .",
    "we discuss and emphasize several observational and theoretical issues that must be overcome before superbubble blow out theory can be practically tested .",
    "finally , we apply this collective - action blow out theory to superwinds blowing out from the extended gaseous halos of their host galaxies , as our and other workers observational results strongly suggest the gaseous halos of star forming galaxies are well represented as exponential atmospheres .",
    "it is important to note that blow out from the halo into the igm is energetically more difficult that blow out from the disk into the halo .",
    "the existing uncertainties in the accuracy of blow out theory prevent robust quantitative assessment of whether the metal enriched gas powering superwinds escapes into the igm .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that is is still probable that the hot , metal - enriched gas in superwinds does escape into the igm , even for galaxies as massive as @xmath3  @xmath4 in normal environments ( _ i.e .",
    "_ not in dense galaxies groups or clusters ) .",
    "irrespective of the quantitative uncertainties associated with disk and halo blow out , we wish to emphasize that the distribution of gas in the halos of star forming galaxies observed in the optical and in the soft x - ray band implies that the crucial spatial region around a galaxy that controls whether gas will escape into the igm is not the outer halo @xmath1 kpc from the host galaxy .",
    "instead it is the inner few halo scale heights , within @xmath2 kpc of the galaxy plane , a region well probed by existing observational methods .    within the next few years",
    "it will be possible to calibrate theories of disk and halo blow out and mechanical energy feedback against observations of local star - forming galaxies , and thus make meaningful inferences about the enrichment of the igm by outflows , and the influence of massive star feedback on cosmological scales .    over the several years",
    "this project has been in the making , we have have been fortunate to benefit from the insightful comments and questions of many astronomers , too numerous to mention individually , to whom we extend our thanks .",
    "we would also like to thank s. hameed for providing us with r - band and h@xmath10  images of ngc 1482 .",

    "<S> we investigate how the empirical properties of hot x - ray - emitting gas in a sample of seven starburst and three normal edge - on spiral galaxies ( a sample which covers the full range of star - formation intensity found in disk galaxies ) correlate with the size , mass , star formation rate and star formation intensity in the host galaxies . from this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we investigate various aspects of mechanical energy `` feedback ''  the return of energy to the ism from massive star supernovae and stellar winds  on galactic scales . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray observations make use of the unprecedented spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory to remove x - ray emission from point sources more accurately than in any previous study , and hence obtain the x - ray properties of the diffuse thermal emission alone . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , the diffuse x - ray properties of the normal spirals ( both in their disks and halos ) fall where extrapolation of the trends from the starburst galaxies with superwinds would predict . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , using a variety of multi - wavelength star formation rate and intensity indicators , that the luminosity of diffuse x - ray emission in the disk ( and where detected , in the halo ) is directly proportional to the rate of mechanical energy feedback from massive stars in the host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> accretion of gas from the igm does not appear to be a significant contributor to the diffuse x - ray emission in this sample . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , with only three non - starburst normal spiral galaxies it is hard to exclude an accretion - based origin for extra - planar diffuse x - ray emission around normal star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> larger galaxies tend to have more extended x - ray - emitting halos , but galaxy mass appears to play no role in determining the properties of the disk or extra - planar x - ray emitting plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these luminosity and size correlations leads to a correlation between the surface brightness of the diffuse x - ray emission and the mean star formation rate per unit area in the disk ( calculated from the far - infrared luminosity and the optical size of the galaxy , @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> further observational work of this form will allow empirical constraints to be made on the critical star formation rate per unit disk area necessary to blow hot gas out of the disk into the halo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a minor generalization of standard superbubble theory directly predicts a critical star formation rate per unit area for superbubble blow out from the disk , and by extension for superwinds to blow out of the gaseous halos of their host galaxy . at present </S>",
    "<S> there are a variety of poorly - known parameters in this theory which complicate comparison between observation and theory , making it impossible to assess the quantitative accuracy of standard superbubble blow out theory . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the crucial spatial region around a galaxy that controls whether gas in starburst - driven superwinds will escape into the igm is not the outer halo @xmath1 kpc from the host galaxy , but the inner few halo scale heights , within @xmath2 kpc of the galaxy plane . </S>",
    "<S> given the properties of the gaseous halos we observe , superwind outflows from disk galaxies of mass @xmath3  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 should still eject some fraction of their material into the igm . </S>"
