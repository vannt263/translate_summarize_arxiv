    "close - in ( or hot ) planets , usually defined as those having semimajor axes @xmath12 au ( or orbital periods @xmath13 days ) , are the easiest to detect , both with radial velocity ( rv ) surveys and transits .",
    "almost half of the confirmed planets currently known correspond to this population , although this proportion is certainly affected by observational bias .",
    "it is believed that close - in planets can not have been formed in situ ( e.g. lin et al .",
    "1996 ) , and thus constitute an interesting evidence for orbital migration and dynamical evolution of extrasolar planetary systems .    while most of the exoplanets detected by doppler techniques correspond to giant planets ( typically , masses @xmath14 ) , the recent discoveries from _ kepler _ have been dominated by much smaller planets , usually in the super - earth and neptune mass range .",
    "although this may point to the fact that smaller planetary bodies are more numerous ( e.g. mayor et al .",
    "2009 , howard et al .",
    "2010 , howard et al .",
    "2012 ) , the exact statistics also depends on metallicities of the host stars ( e.g. fischer & valenti 2005 , santos et al . 2011 ) .    the distribution of planets in a planetary radius ( @xmath1 ) vs. orbital period ( @xmath0 ) plane provides important information about planetary formation and migration in different planet - size regimes ( e.g. bentez - llambay et al .",
    "2011 , latham et al .",
    "2011 , youdin 2011 , hasegawa & pudritz 2012 ) .",
    "also , planetary occurrence in the @xmath7 plane for different stellar metallicities and effective temperatures @xmath15 may lead to insights on how these parameters affect both planetary formation and orbital migration .",
    "for example , there is indication that sub - jovian planets may be found in a wider range of metallicities than giant planets ( buchhave et al .",
    "2012 ) , and that giant planet occurrence increases with @xmath15 and stellar mass ( johnson et al .",
    "2010 , howard et al .",
    "2012 ) .    in this paper",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of planets in the @xmath7 plane , including public data from both confirmed planets and kepler planetary candidates .",
    "we restrict our analysis to planets with orbital periods @xmath16 days and host stars with masses @xmath17 our goal is to search for possible ( statistically significant ) trends in the @xmath7 plane and discuss possible explanations for these trends . in section 2",
    "we analyze the distribution of close - in planets in the @xmath7 plane and point out the possible existence of a sub - jovian desert for orbital periods lower than @xmath18-@xmath5 days . in section 3",
    "we discuss several new trends in the @xmath7 distribution of planets according to the stellar metallicity . for planets without detected transits",
    "we extend our analysis to the plane of orbital period vs. minimum planetary mass ( i.e. @xmath19 diagram ) .",
    "discussions and possible dynamical interpretations of the detected trends close the paper in section 5 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the distribution of orbital periods of all confirmed planets ( as of july 2012 ) with @xmath16 days , totaling 287 .",
    "the left plot shows @xmath0 as a function of the mass , while the one on the right shows the corresponding distribution in terms of the planetary radius @xmath1 .",
    "these two data sets are not identical because some planets have no detected transits , and thus no information is known of their radii .",
    "we can separate the planets , according to their mass , roughly into three groups : jovian planets ( @xmath20 ) , neptunes or sub - jovian planets ( @xmath21 ) , and super - earths ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this division is arbitrary , but it can be useful to highlight different formation mechanisms of different populations . in terms of the physical radii , these groups can also roughly be defined by the relations : @xmath23 for jovian planets , @xmath24 for neptunes and sub - jovian planets , and @xmath25 for super - earths .",
    "however , the observed diversity in planetary densities implies that there is no unique relationship between radius and mass , so the above relationship is only illustrative .",
    "also keep in mind that in most cases planetary masses estimated from doppler surveys are only minimum bounds to actual values , because of the ( generally ) unknown inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the observer s line of sight .",
    "days.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    even with these reservations in mind , figure [ fig1 ] shows an apparent absence of sub - jovian planets with orbital periods smaller than @xmath26 days .",
    "possibly the first reference to a possible _ sub - jovian desert _ was made by szabo & kiss ( 2011 ) , although most of the super - earths then detected belonged to small mass stars .",
    "bentez - llambay et al .",
    "( 2011 ) corrected that distribution by normalizing the semimajor axis by stellar mass and radius ; with the exception of corot-7b , the other exoplanet population seemed to have a distribution more in accordance to a _",
    "step _ function .",
    "specifically , the orbital periods of close - in planets with @xmath27 appeared to be restricted to periods @xmath28 day , while smaller masses seemed to be detected only down to @xmath26 days .",
    "this trend seems compatible with the existence of an inner cavity in the protoplanetary disk acting as a planetary trap for type i migration , plus a long - term evolution due to tidal effects after the gas disk dispersal ( ben itez - llambay et al .",
    "2011 ) .    over the past year",
    ", however , as the population of small - mass increased dramatically ( especially due to _ kepler _ ) , a significant population of small super - earth planets has been detected around solar - type stars with lower orbital periods , also down to @xmath29 day or even lower .",
    "nevertheless , the absence of very hot sub - jovian planets is still maintained and today , with 287 confirmed planets , the existence of this unpopulated region appears very prominent , especially in the @xmath19 plane ( figure [ fig1]a ) .",
    "although observational bias can not be ruled out , it seems unlikely .",
    "while planetary detection via doppler techniques favor large masses , several planets have been found in the sub - jovian mass range with longer orbital periods .",
    "moreover , in principle _ kepler _ should have little problem in detecting a planet within this proposed sub - jovian desert .",
    "an estimate ( koch 2004 ) shows that planets in this region should have an snr value between 400 and 1600 ( assuming solar - type star , observational time of 1 year and an impact parameter @xmath30 ) , much higher than most of the confirmed _ kepler _ planets .",
    "population synthesis models ( e.g. ida & lin 2004 , mordasini et al .",
    "2009 , 2012 ) predict a paucity of neptune - size planets relatively close to the star as a result of the interplay between planetary formation timescales and different migration regimes ( type i and type ii ) .",
    "however , these predictions have not been validated ( e.g. howard et al .",
    "the desert proposed by szabo & kiss is too sharply defined in the mass range , includes masses almost up to @xmath31 , and is restricted to very small orbital periods .    as of july 2012",
    ", there are more than 2300 _ kepler _ candidate planets that have not been confirmed nor validated .",
    "we tested whether the distribution of these candidates in the @xmath7 plane also shows the sub - jovian desert or introduces a more smoothed distribution .",
    "however , we must keep in mind that among _ kepler _ candidates there are bound to be a number of false positives ( fp ) , whose number is still a matter of debate .",
    "lissauer et al .",
    "( 2012 ) argued that although fp may be more common among koi with only a single transit signal , among targets displaying multiple - planet transits the fraction of real systems could be as large as @xmath32 .    ) and _ kepler _ candidates ( green & red ) , separated according to multiple _ kepler _ systems ( left , @xmath33 ) and single _ kepler _ candidates ( right , @xmath34).,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the left plot in figure [ fig2 ] shows the distribution of these candidate systems ( green circles ) , once again in the @xmath7 plane . for comparison ,",
    "the confirmed planets , in great majority coming from observations other than _ kepler _ , are shown in black . _",
    "kepler _ multiple candidates tend to be smaller and contain almost no hot jupiters . on the other hand ,",
    "a significant number of super - earth candidates are seen , some of them in systems with up to six planets .",
    "however , the sub - jovian desert is still apparent in this data . for @xmath35 days",
    ", there is a large number of hot jupiters from rv surveys and a large number of super - earths ( and neptunes ) from _ kepler _ , but almost no planets with radii between @xmath5 and @xmath36 .",
    "in order to analyze whether this lack of planets is statistically significant , we performed a very simple monte carlo test .",
    "we counted the number of detected bodies ( including both confirmed planets and multiple systems candidates ) with @xmath37 r_\\oplus$ ] and @xmath38 $ ] days , @xmath39 being an upper limit which was varied in successive trials .",
    "for each value of @xmath39 we then generated a series of @xmath40 fictitious populations with the same number of data points within the same intervals of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and counted what percentage of them included no values within the proposed desert .",
    "we varied @xmath39 between @xmath41 and @xmath42 days , and considered uniform distributions in @xmath7 as well as in @xmath43 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath39 and the chosen distribution function , we found that the probability of reproducing the desert was at most @xmath44 , although in most cases much smaller than @xmath45 .",

    "the gray continuous line shows a linear fit in @xmath46 obtained considering only those planets with @xmath47 days .",
    "dashed lines show the @xmath48 values.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    we then proceeded to do a different , and slightly more elaborate statistical test .",
    "first , we searched for a region around the suspected desert with a population of detected planets as uniform and homogeneous as possible .",
    "although our first choice was to analyze the distribution in planetary radius around @xmath26 days , we noted that both the stellar populations and detection techniques that dominate each side of the desert are different ( _ kepler _ for smaller planets , and rv for jovian masses ) , and therefore it would not be correct to construct a single fitted distribution function for both sub - populations . in consequence , once again we chose the distribution of observed planets according to orbital period , delimited in values of @xmath1 within @xmath37 r_\\oplus$ ] .",
    "we then binned the observed population of planets in the interval @xmath49 $ ] days and fitted the data using a polynomial distribution .",
    "we found that the resulting functional fit was practically linear in @xmath50 , with coefficients that were very robust with respect to the bin size . together with the coefficients of the fit we also estimated their uncertainties @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we projected this fitted distribution function to the region of the proposed desert ( i.e. @xmath35 days ) and compared it with the observed distribution .",
    "we found that the difference between them is of excess of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is an estimation of the variance of the fit in this region .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "again , the observed lack of planets close to the star does not appear consistent with the distribution found for larger orbital periods .",
    "although the distribution of _ kepler _ multi - planet candidates preserves the alleged desert , once the single planet candidates are introduced , the distribution for @xmath35 days becomes more fuzzy ( red circles in figure [ fig2]b ) .",
    "in particular , the sub - jovian region with @xmath35 days now appears populated with around 16 planetary candidates .",
    "the question therefore arises : does this mean that the sub - jovian desert is not completely void of planets , or are these `` problematic '' candidates false positives ?    among single candidates ,",
    "the percentage of fp is expected to be higher than for multiple - candidate systems .",
    "morton & johnson ( 2011 ) estimated fps of the order of @xmath6 , while borucki et al .",
    "( 2011 ) mentioned values as large as @xmath54 for rank 2 koi , and even @xmath55 for ranks 3 and 4 .",
    "more recently , santerne et al . (",
    "2012 ) performed radial velocity observations on a sample of 46 _ kepler _ candidates with orbital periods below 25 days , and concluded that as much as @xmath56 of the single planet candidates could be fps .",
    "colon et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have proposed an even larger fp fraction , close to @xmath57 , especially for small orbital periods .",
    "recently , bonomo et al .",

    "kepler _ data .",
    "they pointed out that , according to the planetary occurrence ratio proposed by howard ( 2012 ) , _ corot _ should have detected a much larger number of hot neptunes than actually found .",
    "although the discrepancy could be due to the different stellar populations observed by both missions , it could also be indicative of an underestimation of the fp probability assumed by howard ( 2012 ) .",
    "given these results , it is perhaps possible that the @xmath59 candidates within the proposed desert are in fact fps .",
    "we discuss this possibility in more detail below .",
    "two of our problematic cases ( koi 64.01 and koi 102.01 ) were mentioned by borucki et al .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the change in the @xmath7 distribution of _ kepler _ candidates when these questionable cases are eliminated .",
    "the overall shape of the distribution is maintained , but now the number of planets in the proposed desert has decreased significantly , from 16 to 9 .",
    "their koi numbers are : 356.01 , 439.01 , 506.01 , 732.01 , 823.01,1285.01 , 1812.01 , 1988.01 and 2276.01",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether these candidates survive future scrutiny .",
    "finally , the right - hand frame of figure [ fig4 ] shows the distribution of the proposed fps .",
    "their distribution in the @xmath7 plane is fairly uniform and contrasts with both previous plots .",
    "here we have included 158 proposed fps , which represent less than @xmath62 of all planetary candidates and @xmath63 of single planet candidates . if the ratio of fps is much higher , as suggested by studies mentioned earlier in this section , then it is possible that the most or even all of the problematic cases within the sub - jovian desert may actually be false positives .      even if some of these problematic cases are confirmed as actual planets , the sub - jovian region with orbital periods below @xmath18-@xmath5 days still appears significantly underpopulated .",
    "in such a case , it would be more appropriate to refer to this region as a _ sub - jovian pampas _",
    ", as characterized by a significantly lower planetary occurrence with respect to the surrounding regions .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the distribution of confirmed planets and _ kepler _ candidates according to planetary radii , for three intervals of orbital period ( values are specified in the upper right - hand corner of the left plot ) . for @xmath64 days",
    ", the distribution shows a maximum around @xmath65-@xmath66 and sharp decrease in planetary occurrence for both larger and smaller radii .",
    "this distribution is not corrected with respect to observational bias , so the real distribution of planets must be significantly different , especially for @xmath67 ( mayor et al . , 2011 ,",
    "howard et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the observed distribution for lower orbital periods ( @xmath68 $ ] days ) appears bimodal , with a global maximum near @xmath69 and a second ( local ) maximum for jovian masses . while some hot jupiters may",
    "have reached his orbital distance through gas disk - driven orbital migration , at least some of them are believed to be the consequence of tidal circularization from high - eccentricity orbits caused by kozai - capture ( e.g. naoz et al . 2011 ) or planetary scattering ( nagasawa et al .",
    "2008 , beaug & nesvorn 2012 ) .",
    "the bi - modality of the planetary distribution for @xmath70 days in figure [ fig5 ] could be because this plot combines discoveries from two different sources ( rv surveys and _ kepler _ ) which have different sensitivities and focus on different stellar populations .",
    "however , it could also be real , indicating that tidal capture is not as effective for sub - jovian planets .    for @xmath35 days ,",
    "the bi - modality is even more pronounced , and the sub - jovian region for these short periods appears severely underpopulated .",
    "again , some ( or most ) of the hot jupiters could have been tidally captured , while most of the super - earths could have been driven very close to the star by disc - planet interactions .",
    "it is not clear why neither appears to have been effective for sub - jovian bodies .",
    "youdin ( 2011 ) presented an analysis of the distribution of _ kepler _ candidates in the @xmath7 plane , fitting different power laws for four sub - samples : planets smaller or larger than @xmath66 , and orbital periods lower or higher than @xmath71 days .",
    "he found significant differences in the size distribution of planets for @xmath72 days and @xmath73 days .",
    "this result is closely related to the paucity of sub - jovian planets discussed here . however , since he did not include data other than _ kepler _ s , and did not eliminate possible fps , none of their distributions exhibited bi - modality .",
    "the paucity of hot jupiters ( hj ) in detections by _ kepler _ , with respect to rv surveys , is believed to be due to low metallicity in most of the kic . nevertheless , the jury is still out with respect to small masses .",
    "previous spectroscopic analysis of host stars with planets have been limited to those detected with rv surveys ( e.g. santos et al .",
    "2004 , fischer & valenti 2005 , johnson et al .",
    "2010 , sousa et al .",
    "2011 ) , and thus mainly to giant planets .",
    "these results indicate that jupiter - size bodies are more likely to be found around metal - rich stars , at least in what concerns the population of planets in close - in orbits .",
    "this tendency is not so clear for neptune - size planets ( sousa et al .",
    "2008 , ghezzi et al .",
    "2010 , sousa et al .",
    "2011 ) , that seem to be found for a wider metallicity range .",
    "however , since rv surveys have only been able to detect very few planets in the terrestrial mass range , there has been no clear understanding of the metallicity relation for the occurrence of small planets .",
    "this problem was recently undertaken by buchhave et al .",
    "( 2012 ) who analyzed metallicity values for a total of 152 kic stars . since the metallicities estimated by _",

    "these results indicate that while giant planets appear to require high metallicities , smaller planets can form even around very metal - poor stars .",

    "the most interesting trend that can be noted in figure [ fig6 ] is not in the sub - jovian mass range , but for small planets ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "small planets belonging to metal - poor stars are located beyond @xmath80 days , while small planets closer to the star tend to have higher metallicities .",
    "another interesting trend from figure [ fig6 ] is the absence of planets with @xmath81 in metal - poor stars .",
    "thus , it appears that in order to form giants or sub - giants , at least a solar metallicity is necessary .",
    "the trends discussed above could be tied to a more pronounced planetary migration ( nebular gas disk or planetesimal driven ) in systems with a larger solid content , while small planets formed around metal - poor stars may stay near their formation locations or migrate a lesser amount .",
    "scattering among the small planets could also have played a role .",
    "stars with a higher solid content could tend to form systems of more rocky planets , which would be stable only when their eccentricities are damped by friction ( gas or dynamical ) .",

    "once again we note that bodies around metal - poor stars are preferably found with larger orbital periods than their metal - rich counterparts .    for intermediate masses ( @xmath98 ) , while their distribution in the @xmath7 plan showed no planets with @xmath99 } < -0.2 $ ] , figure [ fig8 ] shows 3 cases , two of which are identified in the plot .",
    "kepler-25b is a planet orbiting a stellar binary in a circumbinary orbit ( welsh et al .",
    "2012 ) and its formation or evolutionary track could be very different from that of planets around single stars .",
    "kepler-22b is the most distant planet _ kepler _ has detected so far , with an orbital period of @xmath100 days .",
    "transit data allow for a fairly precise determination of its radius and correspond to a small planet ( @xmath101 , borucki et al .",
    "its mass , however , is not well known .",
    "preliminary values , estimated from 16 rv data points , give @xmath102 , which would indicate a sub - jovian planet .",
    "both values are not easy to reconcile .",
    "however , given the small number of rv observations , we believe the location of this planet in the sub - jovian domain is currently questionable .",
    "the third planet in the sub - jovian region of the @xmath94 plane is hat - p-12b ( hartman et al .",
    "2009 ) , a planet with both rv and transit determinations .",
    "hat - p-12b has a mass of @xmath103 and @xmath26 days , placing it barely within the sub - jovian range ( arbitrarily defined ) , and a radius @xmath104 , implying the smallest planetary density ( @xmath105 g/@xmath106 ) known to date .    summarizing",
    ", it appears that there are practically no detected sub - jovian planets with metallicities below -0.2 .",
    "this could imply that these bodies are uncommon , or that they are located beyond @xmath107 days , just as in our own solar system .",
    "we have shown new evidence for a significant paucity of planetary bodies with radii roughly between @xmath5-@xmath108 and orbital periods below @xmath109 days .",
    "this region is completely void of confirmed planets and _ kepler _ multi - planet candidates , and was christened by szabo & kiss ( 2011 ) as a sub - jovian desert .",
    "however , approximately 16 single - planet _ kepler _ candidates are located within this region of the @xmath7 plane .",
    "we find that at least 7 of them are probably false positives .",
    "since we can not rule out the rest , we prefer to refer to this region as a sub - jovian pampas .",
    "the origin of this pampas is not obvious .",
    "it could be related to the effect of atmospheric evaporation ( youdin 2011 ) which is expected to be especially effective in planets with large gas envelopes and low surface gravity .",
    "very close to the star , atmospheric evaporation would not be effective in planets with high surface gravity ( such as jovian bodies ) but could readily strip the volatiles from smaller planets leaving behind the solid cores . in consequence , while most of the hot jupiters would not be significantly affected , the observed radius of smaller planets would decrease over time leading to a depletion of this region .",
    "although youdin ( 2011 ) only proposes such a mechanism for relatively small planets ( @xmath110-@xmath111 ) , it may be applicable to a larger interval . extrapolating from his idea",
    ", the depletion of hot neptunes would not be complete if sub - jovian planets originally have very diverse core sizes ( relative to their gas envelopes ) .",
    "the change in the planet radius due to atmospheric evaporation would then not be equally effective for all of them . the result would then be a _ partial _ depletion of the region , causing the appearance of the observed sub - jovian pampas .",
    "however , it is difficult to estimate whether this effect would be effective even up to planetary radii close to jovian values .",
    "another possibility is dynamical in nature .",
    "in beaug & nesvorn ( 2012 ) we showed that a dynamical tide model ( e.g. ivanov & papaloizou 2011 ) for quasi - parabolic orbits is necessary in order to allow tidal trapping sufficiently far from the central star to avoid stellar engulfment .",
    "dynamical tides , however , are expected to be inefficient for planets with most of its mass in solids ( as opposed to gas - rich planets such as jupiter ) . consequently ,",
    "if the sub - jovian planets have large cores and light atmospheres , then dynamical tides would not have being able to tidally trap the planets sufficiently far from the star to avoid tidal engulfment , leading to a sparsity of such planets close to the star .",
    "with respect to the distribution as function of stellar metallicity , the lack of super - earths with small orbital period around metal - poor stars may point to a delayed formation of these planets , implying a smaller radial range of planetary migration .",
    "the paucity of planets with @xmath112-@xmath113 around metal - poor stars with orbital periods up to @xmath114 days is also interesting , and could indicate that neptunes around metal - poor stars did not migrate far and are all located beyond @xmath114 days .    a word of caution at this point .",
    "we have assumed that the metallicity index [ fe / h ] is a proxy for planetary formation .",
    "gonzalez ( 2009 ) points out that abundance of other heavy elements ( mg , si ) , which together with fe define the so - called refractory index `` ref '' , could also be important . in their recent survey of chemical abundances for 1111 fgk stars from the harps gto planet search program ,",
    "adibekyan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) indicate higher [ ref / h ] values for neptune - size planets than [ fe / h ] alone .",
    "however , the role and relative importance of different refractory materials is not yet firmly established , so it is unclear how using [ ref , h ] instead of [ fe , h ] could affect our results .",
    "the trends pointed out in this paper are preliminary and we believe they deserve future scrutiny . future planetary detections and confirmations should be able to validate ( or rule out ) these trends and allow for a better interpretation of their origin .",
    "this work has been supported by a national science foundation ( nsf ) through a astronomy and astrophysics grant ( aag ) , the argentina research council -conicet- and the universidad nacional de crdoba .",
