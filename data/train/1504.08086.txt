    "the presence of a certain amount of impurities is , in some sense , an inevitable consequence of tokamak plasma operation .",

    "the main goal of this endeavour is to predict the degree of impurity accumulation for a given set of discharge parameters to avoid deleterious effect from impurity accumulation .",
    "turbulent transport of impurities , which has been a subject of an extensive study in fusion plasma physics for decades @xcite is rekindling interest in this regard since recent experimental evidence has shown the importance of the turbulent transport process in determining the core impurity profile@xcite . when impurity concentration is sufficiently low",
    ", one may treat the impurities as passive reactants to background turbulence . in this case , the so - called trace approximation has been used to study turbulent impurity transport@xcite . if impurity concentration is considerable , however , they start to affect microinstability@xcite and the trace approximation becomes invalid , as pointed out by flp and nordman@xcite .",
    "most notably , the alignment of a impurity profile with that of main ions has been known to yield a significant change of stability of the ion temperature gradient ( itg ) mode , sometimes leading to the destabilization of an independent impurity drift mode@xcite our interest in this paper lies in the study of the impact of impurities on turbulent momentum transport , in particular , the generation of intrinsic rotation via residual stress@xcite .",
    "we note that few results are available in this aspect , given a lot of published papers on turbulent impurity transport in tokamaks .",
    "intrinsic rotation in magnetic fusion plasmas is thought to be generated through the conversion of radial inhomogeneity into @xmath0 (= spectrally averaged wavenumber in parallel direction ) asymmetry via residual stress .",
    "this conversion process requires some symmetry breaking mechanism@xcite .",
    "an early paper calculated the particle flux in the presence of combined itg , impurity and parallel velocity gradients , but not addressed the turbulent residual stress giving rise to intrinsic rotation@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to provide a simple physics insight into which how turbulence driven residual stress is related to the characteristics of impurities .",
    "intuitively , one may expect that the change of stability and characteristics of an unstable mode structure in the presence of a considerable amount of impurities will alter the turbulent residual stress .",
    "this effect may change the amount of intrinsic torque anticipated in toakamak experiments . since intrinsic rotation",
    "is envisioned to provide necessary plasma rotation in reactor - relevant tokamak experiments , including iter , because of the limited capability of driving the necessary torque in a reactor by neutral beam injection , it is of importance to conduct a sufficiently detailed study of this effect .    to address the problem mentioned above ,",
    "we employ a set two fluid equations for main and impurity ions . by treating impurities as a separate species satisfying impurity fluid equations",
    ", we can incorporate the effects of impurities on the characteristics of the itg mode self - consistently .",
    "for simplicity , we adopt the sheared slab geometry . by avoiding the complication in analysis due to the sophisticated toroidal geometry , we focus on the basic physics of the impurity effect on residual stress in the presence of impurity - modified itg turbulence .",
    "analyses show that the relative importance of residual stress to the diffusive momentum flux is reduced when the gradient of impurity and main ions has the same sign .",
    "this indicates a possible decrease of intrinsic rotation when a considerable amount of core - peaked impurity is present .",

    "however , this term may play a role in @xmath193 when fusion - born helium ashes are present because of their small charge number and natural tendency to align with main ions .",
    "thus , results in this section might raise a potential concern to iter operation where a significant amount of plasma rotation is envisioned to be produced via intrinsic rotation .",
    "in conclusion , this paper has shown that impurities may change the amount of intrinsic rotation by affecting the residual stress driven by turbulence . to make an analytic study , we employed a two fluid model for ions and impurities for itg turbulence in sheared slab geometry .",
    "the ion and impurity velocities are assumed to be equal , which is strictly valid in the collisional regime .",
    "then , we evaluated the momentum diffusivity and the residual stress in a coupled main ion - impurity system .",
    "the principal findings of this paper are summarized as follows :    * characteristics of itg modes , such as the growth rate or the mode structure , changes significantly by the variation of impurities contents and/or the alignment of an impurity profile with that of main ions .",
    "quasi - linear calculations show that these changes result in a considerable change of turbulence driven residual stress , hence the amount of intrinsic rotation .",
    "* the ratio of residual stress ( @xmath171 ) to the diffusive momentum flux ( @xmath172 ) , @xmath194 , can be used as a quantitative measure of relative importance of @xmath171 over @xmath195 .",
    "* for a core - peaked impurity profile shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) schematically , @xmath20 decreases due to the stabilization and a large increase of the mode shift of the unstable mode . for a wall - peaked impurity profile shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) schematically , @xmath20 increases a little implying the predominance of @xmath171 over @xmath172 .",
    "the degree of the enhancement of @xmath20 when @xmath100 is smaller than that of reduction when @xmath100 for a given impurity content .    as a possible implication of the present study",
    ", we pointed out that the amount of intrinsic rotation in burning plasma experiments might be reduced .",
    "this is due to the presence of @xmath196 ashes which is likely to be aligned with the main ion profile .",
    "for example , approximately @xmath197 of intrinsic rotation loss is expected if we assume the presence of @xmath123 ions with @xmath198 well - aligned with a main ion profile .",
    "such a well - aligned impurity profile is also possible in present day devices , as shown in recent experiments in kstar@xcite , due to the prevalence of turbulent impurity transport .",
    "we note that this may cause the decoupling of the ion temperature and the toroidal rotation profiles , which has been observed in recent kstar h - mode experiments@xcite .",
    "when @xmath94 , the reduction of residual stress will be larger than that of the diffusive momentum flux . since the intrinsic torque is believed to be maximized near the pedestal top region as shown in recent flux - driven gyrofluid simulations@xcite , the reduction of the residual stress due to impurities will result in the reduction of a net intrinsic torque .",
    "this will reduce the total amount of toroidal rotation when an edge pedestal build up . to confirm this scenario , measurements of a rotation profile for a varying impurity contents",
    "is necessary .",
    "this is left as a future investigation .    as an extension of the present study",
    ", we plan to perform a gyrokinetic analysis including impurities .",
    "nonlinear gyrokinetic or gyrofluid simulations are also planned to elucidate the nonlinear physical process of intrinsic rotation generation and saturation in the presence of impurities .",
    "these will be outstanding research subjects which will be published in the future .",
