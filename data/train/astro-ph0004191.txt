    "the development of sn  1987a provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe , at high spatial , spectral , and temporal resolution , the birth of a supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "observations of snr  1987a might reveal the angular and velocity distribution of the ejecta by highlighting where it impacts a presumably well - known nebular structure . while snr  1987a has been observed for some years in x - rays and radio , only optical / near - ir data have sufficient sensitivity and angular resolution to detail the structures presented here .",
    "the early discovery of these interaction regions is crucial .",
    "we demonstrate how they are best revealed with difference imaging , in h@xmath0 and [ ] , and in  1.083@xmath1 m , for which the newly - formed spots have greatest contrast above the circumstellar equatorial ring ( er ) .",
    "we detect several new interaction sites , and trace known features back to epochs well before their actual discoveries .",
    "as the contrast between the first hot spot and the underlying er was greater in  1.083@xmath1 m than in optical lines at early times (  3 ) , we have conducted ground - based monitoring of the ejecta - er collision in this line .",
    "data were taken on the ctio 4-m telescope with tip - tilt first order wavefront correction , on 5 nights between 1997 november and 1998 october [ days 39264243 after sn core collapse ] with the cirim imager [ 1.75  h total integrations ] and 1999 december 25 [ day 4688 ] with the osiris imager / spectrometer [ 3.5  h total integration ] .  to accurately measure small changes in the er and hot spot fluxes , we apply image subtraction techniques @xcite as brieflly outlined below .",
    "we also deconvolve images from each epoch , using multiscale maximum entropy @xcite to improve the fwhm to @xmath203 .",
    "we also analyze data from the _ hst _ public archive , making use of : a ) stis spectra ( g750 m grating ) from 1997",
    "april 26 [ day 3715 ] and 1998 november 14 [ day 4283 ] ; b ) nicmos images taken through f108n on 1997 december 9 [ day 3942 ] ; and c ) wfpc2 images taken through f336w , f439w , f555w , f656n , f658n , f675w , and f814w between 1994 february and 1999 april [ days 25374440 ] .",
    "pipeline calibrated stis spectra were taken directly from the archive , while the nicmos dither pattern was manually re - mosaiced . for pc chip images , aberrant pixels were replaced , and multiple exposures were co - added with cosmic - ray rejection .",
    "recent press - release images from @xcite are highly deconvolved , an invasive procedure which is sensitive to the input psf and the stability of the pixel map .",
    "furthermore , subtraction of deconvolved images assumes that constant sources are mapped identically in each epoch . to study hot spot variability ,",
    "we opted for the non - iterative , non - invasive procedure of psf - matched difference imaging .",
    "the pc chip has a psf fwhm @xmath21.7 pixels , below nyquist critical sampling , so we first convolved images with a circular gaussian of @xmath3 , smoothing to a final @xmath4 pixels",
    ". registered , convolved frames were then psf matched , photometrically scaled , and differenced using _ difimphot _ calls to iraf routines ( e.g.  _ immatch _ ) .",
    "all flux calibrations used standard _ hst _ methods .",
    "we propose to denote known and future hot spots as , e.g.  , where the first digit represents the order of discovery and the trailing three digits encode the first reported imaging pa of the feature .",
    "this scheme preserves the order of appearance and provides a rough spatial location .",
    "names based soley on discovery order will become confusing as new knots appear at a higher rate .",
    "the pa encoding is approximate ; different passbands and data quality will naturally show small pa differences .",
    "_ discovery of new hot spot activity : _ the highest quality image ( figure  1a ) from our ground - based monitoring ( 1998 october 6 with a @xmath5 ) shows the er and the first hot spot ( ) resolved between stars 2 and 3 .  figure  1b displays a difference between 1999 and 1998 images . while the continued brightening of is obvious , a second spot ( ) has now appeared  the first new locus of activity @xcite since the discovery of in 1997 april spectra @xcite .",
    "figure  1c presents a deconvolution of the 1999 december image , with a final @xmath6 .",
    "several regions of brightening are distributed around the er .  such low - level deconvolution features require confirmation , seen below with _ hst _ images .",

    "star  5 and are clearly resolved on the er , with no other hot spots significantly detected . the ratio of f108n flux from to the total er+ flux is 0.06@xmath80.01 .",
    "the same ratio from 1998 february 6 wfpc2 imaging is 0.03@xmath80.01 for both f656n and f675w , and is 0.02@xmath80.01 for f502n in 1997 july 10 .  since f656n and f675w imaging followed the f108n epoch by nearly two months while was brightening rapidly , _ at early times",
    "_ hot spots appear at greater contrast above the er in  1.083  @xmath1 m than in strong optical transitions , as found in ground - based data @xcite .",
    "we recommend diligent monitoring of the er in , with adaptive optics and with a resuscitated nicmos , to detect new hot spot activity promptly .",
    "_ confirmation in archival _ hst _ data : _ as reported by @xcite , a stis g750m/6581  spectrum from 1998 november shows the spectroscopic signature of a developing hot spot .",
    "the 02 wide slit was positioned at pa 1029 , and includes and perhaps a fraction of .  as figure  1e shows ,",
    "a wide - velocity feature , with fwhm @xmath2150  km  s@xmath9 , is redshifted from the er at this position by @xmath250  km  s@xmath9 , correcting for the displacement between the slit center and .",
    "this feature s flux is @xmath22@xmath10  erg  s@xmath9  @xmath11 in h@xmath0 .",
    "this is similar in description to on the near side of the er , seen in 1997 april by @xcite , blueshifted over the range 0 - 250  km  s@xmath9",
    ".  with a measured h@xmath0 flux of  erg  s@xmath9  @xmath11 , on day 3715 appears more developed than on day 4283 .",
    "following our ground - based discovery of new spot activity , and four other new spots were promptly detected in stis f28x50lp and wfpc2 f656n imaging @xcite . as was detectable in archival _ hst _ spectra , we reviewed the public stis , nicmos , and wfpc2 data to search for the earliest appearances of all spots .",
    "no spots other than and were seen in the stis or nicmos archives , and appeared only in the stis spectra from 1998 november described above .",
    "figure  1f displays the f656n difference image between 1999 april and 1998 february .",
    "all of the five `` new '' spots are detected , along with at least three more sites of increasing f656n flux along the er inner edge .",
    "all recently discovered activity began _ no later than 1999 january _ [ day 4337 ] .",
    "the positions , fluxes , and earliest detections of nine spots , measured in the f656n 1999@xmath121998 difference image relative to the centroid of sn  1987a in f656n in 1994 february , are presented in table  1 ( @xmath13 in pa , @xmath8003 in @xmath14 , and @xmath810% in flux for the first four , @xmath830% for the rest ) .  the first eight spots are also detected in 1999 - 1998 f675w differences .",
    "there are also marginal detections of new spots at ( @xmath15 , 051 ) and ( @xmath16 , 048 ) , but these are faint and seen in only one epoch .    known and unknown transient hot pixels contaminate roughly 1% of the pc chip , and since most of the wfpc2 imaging of sn1987a was not spatially dithered within filter sets , these pixels present a persistant , stochastic and non - gaussian source of noise , to which both difference imaging and deconvolution analyses are precariously sensitive .",
    "a full presentation of our analysis technique will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "briefly , we cosmetically correct known bad pixels , while tracking their redistribution through the convolution and registration processes . to minimize false detections ,",
    "a potential hotspot ( residual in a difference image ) must not lie within a bad - pixel domain and must appear in at least two difference images between mutually - exclusive data .",
    "the dashed arrow in figure  1f indicates a `` false '' spot caused by a bad pixel .",
    "newly detected spots should be considered tentative until they have been confirmed with further imaging or spectroscopic data , e.g.   is confirmed in stis spectra from 2000 may 1 @xcite .",
    "the remaining unconfirmed spots could also be reverse - shock h@xmath0 emission at low velocity @xcite .",
    "_ the evolution of : _ figure  2 shows difference images for seven wfpc2 bands spanning optical wavelengths .",
    "each row portrays a single filter , and each column the differences between a given year and 1994 .",
    "orientation is indicated by the inset graphic .",
    "the 1994 images have been scaled down to match the fading er , in order to highlight flux changes on this structure .",
    "as such , residuals from field stars remain , notably for star  5 .  the evolution of is clearly demonstrated .",
    "although first reported in stis spectroscopy from 1997 april , is clearly detectable in 1996 february in f502n , f555w , f675w , and f658n , and is seen faintly in f555w and f675w in 1995 march .",
    "the spot is evident in 1996 even in differences without psf matching",
    ". began developing _ on or before 1995 march _ [ day 2933 ] .",
    "a large arc of transient flux brightens after 1994 in f675w , f656n , and f658n .",
    "first noted by @xcite , it spans @xmath17@xmath18pa@xmath18@xmath19 in f675w and nearly encircles the er in f658n in 1996 .",
    "relative fluxes in these filters in 1996 and 1997 suggest it is mostly [ ] emission",
    ". this could be limb - brightened recombination near the base of the bipolar lobes , where the walls of the `` hourglass '' join with the er @xcite .",
    "a lower density implies a long delay before maximum intensity , consistent with line - emission models of @xcite , and a peak in 1998 indicates a density @xmath210 times lower than in the er .  continued monitoring in [ ] could reveal additional hourglass structure .",
    "began within 8 years after the sn and at least 34 years ahead of the subsequent spots .",
    "did this asymmetry arise in the velocity of the ejecta , in the density of the blue supergiant ( bsg ) wind , or in the morphology of the er itself ? the bsg wind should have been azimuthally smoothed by rotation of the progenitor , and relatively undisturbed by the er ( interior to the reverse shock @xmath25@xmath20  cm from the star ) .",
    "rayleigh - taylor instabilities are expected in this decelerating wind , however over the @xmath220000  yr age of the er @xcite the sound speed would have allowed smoothing of these over scales of tenths of a parsec .",
    "this should be modelled over timescales for the bsg wind propagation to the er ( @xmath21000  yr ) .  if the er / ejecta interaction asymmetry were due to a large - scale misalignment between a bipolar ejecta pattern and the er axis , a counter - jet should have impacted opposite , contrary to observation .",
    "it seems likely that the asymmetry is due to structures in the er or ejecta velocity field with fairly narrow extent in position angle , i.e.  thin fingers or jets .",
    "the homogeneity of the er s shape versus the long delays between the and later spots points to the ejecta velocity field as the major cause .",
    "valuable opportunities to obtain diagnostic spectra of the hot spots at very early times have been lost .",
    "if the fainter spots presented here are confirmed , then the ejecta have reached the er over a wide range of pas , and soon little pristine er material will remain .",
    "frequent ground and space - based monitoring of this rapidly developing event is required , with emphasis on difference imaging in  1.083@xmath1 m , h@xmath0 , and [ ] .",
