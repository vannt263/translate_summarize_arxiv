    "in four years of data taking , the icecube detector has detected 54 high energy starting events ( hese ) with deposited energy between 20 tev and 2 pev which are compatible with an astrophysical population of high energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the observed excess has been also confirmed by independent observation of upward going passing muons in icecube @xcite .",
    "the origin of these neutrinos is still unknown and potential sources include supernova remnants @xcite , pulsars @xcite , active galactic nuclei @xcite and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "dedicated searches for point - like or extended sources have been performed by icecube @xcite ; however , at present , no significant clustering or correlation of event arrival directions with potential source distributions has been found , thus leaving open the possibility of a diffuse astrophysical neutrino population .",
    "the isotropic distribution of the icecube high energy events can be considered as an argument in favor of extragalactic origin of the signal @xcite .",
    "recent works , however , pointed out that icecube data do not exclude ( or are even better fitted ) by allowing for a non negligible contribution of galactic origin @xcite .",
    "it is known that the interactions of cosmic rays ( cr ) with the interstellar medium is a guaranteed source of a diffuse neutrinos in our galaxy .",
    "the calculation of this component is , however , quite uncertain because it requires the knowledge of the cr distribution in all the regions of the galaxy where the gas density is not negligible .",
    "the standard approach relies on local measurements and on the solution of cr transport equations by assuming constant diffusion in the whole galaxy @xcite .",
    "the recent results provided by fermi - lat @xcite may challenge this scenario since they seems to indicate a dependence of the cr spectrum and distribution on the distance from the galactic center , as it is e.g. expected in cr propagation model characterised by radially dependent transport properties @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a self - contained calculation of the diffuse galactic neutrino flux that allow us to discuss the expectations , uncertainties and detectability of this component in general terms , without entering in the complex problem of cr propagation in the galaxy .",
    "we calculate the angular dependence of the galactic neutrino flux and the corresponding rate of high energy starting events ( hese ) in icecube by considering different assumptions for the cr density in the galaxy that are intended to cover the large uncertainty in cr propagation models .",
    "namely , we assume that cr distribution is homogenous in the galaxy ( _ case a _ ) , that it follows the distribution of galactic cr sources ( _ case b _ ) and that it has a spectral index that depends on the galactocentric distance ( _ case c _ ) .",
    "we then discuss the perspectives for the extraction of a galactic neutrino signal from icecube hese data showing that only _ case c _ gives a non negligible chance of detection .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the main ingredients of our calculation . in sect .",
    "[ crflux ] , we discuss our assumptions for the cr distribution in the galaxy . in sect .",
    "[ neutrinoflux ] , we calculate the neutrino flux as a function of neutrino energy and arrival direction . in sect.[eventrates ] , we calculate the expected rates of hese in icecube , taking into account the different angular resolution for shower and track events , and we discuss the perspectives for the extraction of the galactic neutrino signal . in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we summarise our results .",
    "the flux of high energy neutrinos produced at earth by interactions of crs with the gas contained in the galactic disk can be written as :    @xmath0 \\label{nuflux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 indicate the neutrino energy and arrival direction , @xmath3 is the differential cross section for production of neutrinos @xmath4 and antineutrinos @xmath5 by a nucleon of energy @xmath6 in nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "the function @xmath7 represents the differential cr flux ( see next section ) , @xmath8 is the gas density distribution and @xmath9 kpc is the position of the sun . in the above relation , we assumed that , due to neutrino mixing , the neutrino flux at earth is equally distributed among the different flavours .",
    "this approximation is valid with few @xmath10 accuracy , as it is discussed in e.g.  @xcite and it is completely adequate for our purposes . for the nucleon - nucleon cross section , following @xcite , we assume : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and the total inelastic cross section @xmath13 is given by : @xmath14 the adimensional distribution function @xmath15 is given by : @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are described ( with 20% accuracy ) by the analytic formulas given in @xcite .",
    "the galactic distribution of the gas density , @xmath8 , is taken from the public galprop code  @xcite and described in  @xcite .",
    "this is given as a sum of atomic , @xmath19 , and molecular @xmath20 hydrogen .",
    "for the latter we adopt a conversion factor with respect to the @xmath21 density as given by  @xcite from a fit of the diffuse @xmath22 emission .",
    "finally , we assume that helium contributes to the galactic gas with a constant density ratio of @xmath23 with respect to total hydrogen .",
    "in order to predict the neutrino flux at @xmath24 , we need to know the cr flux at @xmath25 . at the sun position ,",
    "the cr flux is constrained by observational data and we can write : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the differential flux at earth of a given nuclear species , @xmath28 represents the nuclear mass number and we considered that the energy of the nucleus is @xmath29 .",
    "we use the parameterisations for @xmath27 given by @xcite that are obtained by fitting the cream @xcite , kascade @xcite and kascade - grande @xcite data in the energy range @xmath30 and assuming that the dominant contributions to the nucleon flux @xmath31 are provided by @xmath32 and @xmath33 nuclei .",
    "note that , if large fluxes of heavy nuclei are introduced at expenses of @xmath32 and @xmath33 components ( i.e. maintaining @xmath34 ) , the nucleon flux @xmath31 is reduced because the cr spectral distributions are decreasing with energy faster than @xmath35 .    the local determination @xmath36 has to be related to the cr flux in all the regions of the galaxy where the gas density is not negligible .",
    "we consider here three different prescriptions of increasing complexity that correspond to different amounts of energy stored in cr .",
    "_ case a : _ we assume that the cr flux is homogenous in the galaxy , i.e. we write : @xmath37 in this assumption , the neutrino flux can be expressed as : @xmath38 where the function that contains the angular dependence : @xmath39 is proportional to the column density of the gas along a given direction , the normalisation parameter @xmath40 is the average column density of the gas given by : @xmath41 and the function : @xmath42 is the neutrino flux integrated over arrival directions .",
    "_ case b : _ we assume that the cr flux scales proportionally to the distribution of cr sources , as it is roughly expected if cr escape is much faster from the halo than radially . namely , we write : @xmath43 where : @xmath44 and @xmath45 describes the cr source density . in this assumption , the neutrino flux can still be factorised as in eq.([nufluxfact ] ) but the function @xmath46 is replaced by the function : @xmath47 we take the snrs distribution parameterised by green et al .",
    "@xcite as representative for the source density @xmath45",
    ". however , since it is known , e.g. from fermi - lat observations of the galactic @xmath22-ray emission @xcite , that in the outer region of the galaxy the cr density drops slower than what one would expects from snrs @xcite ( or pulsars @xcite ) distributions , we use eqs.([caseb ] ) only for galactocentric distances @xmath48 . moreover , since the cr diffusion length is expected to be larger than both the thickness of the galactic disk and of that of the snrs distribution , we assume that the cr flux is constant along the galactic latitudinal axis . in these assumptions ,",
    "the function @xmath49 is given in galactic cylindrical coordinates by : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and we neglected the dependence on @xmath53 .",
    "the function @xmath49 is shown by the blue line in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we see that the cr density is larger by a factor @xmath54 at distances @xmath55 kpc from the galactic center with respect to its local value . to provide a quantitative comparison",
    ", we note that the energy stored in cr contained at @xmath48 is a factor @xmath56 larger than what obtained in the assumption of cr homogeneity .     as a function of the distance from the galactic center in the three considered scenarios .",
    "we assume that the cr flux is approximately constant along the galactic latitudinal axis .",
    "see text for details.[fig1 ] _ ]    _ case c : _ we consider the possibility that the cr spectral distribution depends on the position , as it has been recently observed by fermi - lat at low energies  @xcite . to this purpose ,",
    "we write : @xmath57 where the function : @xmath58 introduces a position - dependent variation @xmath59 of the cr spectral index . the pivot energy in eq.([h ] )",
    "is taken as @xmath60 , since it is observed @xcite that the integrated cr density above 20 gev roughly follows the function @xmath49 defined in _ case b_.    having no direct informations on the radial distribution of high energy cr , we are forced to rely on extrapolations from low energy data and even a relatively small @xmath59 may introduce a large error . at the energy @xmath61 which is most relevant for neutrino telescopes ,",
    "the major effect of the function @xmath62 is to rescale the cr flux by a factor @xmath63 that depends on the position but that can be approximately considered energy - independent . in this assumption ,",
    "the neutrino flux is still given by eq.([nufluxfact ] ) but the function @xmath46 is replaced by : @xmath64    for our calculations , we take the function : @xmath65 for @xmath66 , in galactic cylindrical coordinates , that is intended to reproduce the trend of the spectral index with @xmath67 observed by @xcite at 20 gev and that is also used by @xcite in their phenomenological cr propagation model characterised by radially dependent transport properties .",
    "this corresponds to increasing the cr flux at @xmath68 by a factor @xmath69 close to the galactic center with respect to _",
    "case b_.    the product @xmath70 is shown by the red dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] from which we see that the cr density at @xmath71 is larger by a factor @xmath72 at distances @xmath55 kpc from the galactic center with respect to its value at the sun position .",
    "the energy stored in cr above 2 pev at distances @xmath73 is a factor 14 larger than what obtained in the assumption of cr homogeneity ( i.e. _ case a _ ) .",
    "in the three cases described above , the flux of high energy neutrinos and antineutrinos of each flavour at earth can be written as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 depending on the considered scenario .",
    "being @xmath76 , the function @xmath77 represent the angle - integrated neutrino flux in the _ case a _ ( i.e. uniform cr density ) . for neutrino energies",
    "@xmath78 , this is well approximated by : @xmath79^{-\\alpha(e_\\nu)}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and the spectral index is given by : @xmath81 note that the functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 are not normalized .",
    "the integrated neutrino fluxes in these scenarios are thus given by : @xmath84 where the factors @xmath85 are equal to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the angle - integrated fluxes can be compared with the isotropic flux : @xmath88^{-2.58}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 , that corresponds to the hese event rate observed by icecube in four years data taking @xcite . at the neutrino energy @xmath90 that provides the most relevant contribution to the hese data sample , the diffuse galactic neutrino component is equal to @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 in _ case a , b _ and _ c _ respectively , of the isotropic flux required to explain the 54 events observed by icecube .",
    "this component is thus not negligible but always subdominant and well consistent with the upper limit derived from @xcite by fitting the event arrival directions .",
    "the angular dependence of the flux in the three considered scenarios is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a function of the galactic longitude @xmath94 ( left panel ) and latitude @xmath95 ( right panel ) .",
    "we note that : + _ i ) _ in the considered scenarios , it always exists a region , that contains the galactic center , where the neutrino flux produced by cr interacting with the gas contained in the galactic disk , is comparable or larger than the isotropic contribution .",
    "thus , the diffuse galactic neutrino component is , in principle , sufficiently intense to be detected .",
    "we recall that this component is guaranteed by the existence of cr at pev energies , as it is observed e.g. by cream , kascade and kascade - grande experiments .",
    "our calculations are based on the local determination of the cr flux @xmath31 described in sect.[crflux ] .",
    "we warn the reader that other interpretations of the experimental data are possible @xcite which may decrease the neutrinos flux by a factor @xmath96 @xcite without altering , however , our conclusions ; + _ ii ) _ the region where the diffuse galactic neutrino component dominates is quite narrow . even in the most optimistic _ case c _ , the region where @xmath97 corresponds to @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the optimal detector should have a good pointing capability in order to avoid diluting the signal below the isotropic background .",
    "unfortunately , the icecube hese data set is dominated by showers events that do not allow to reconstruct the neutrino arrival direction with sufficient accuracy ( see next section , for a detailed discussion )",
    ". + _ iii ) _ the angular distributions are quite different in the three considered cases .",
    "the maximal emission is always achieved for @xmath100 and @xmath101 but the neutrino fluxes may differ by large factors for @xmath102 . to be quantitative ,",
    "the flux from the galactic center is larger by a factor @xmath96 and @xmath103 in _ case b _ and _ c _ respectively , with respect to the value obtained in the assumption of uniform cr density ( i.e. _ case a _ ) . in perspective",
    ", this could provide an handle to discriminate among different scenarios , in an ideal detector with sufficient statistics and good pointing capability .",
    "the number of hese event expected in icecube can be calculated by using the effective areas @xmath104 provided by @xcite according to : @xmath105\\\\ \\nonumber   n_{\\rm t } & = &   \\eta \\ , t \\int de_\\nu \\int d\\omega_\\nu \\ ; \\varphi_{\\nu}(e_\\nu,\\hat{n}_\\nu )   a_{\\mu}\\left(e_\\nu,\\hat{n}_\\nu\\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the observation time and we estimated the separate contributions of shower ( @xmath107 ) and track ( @xmath108 ) events . in the above relation , we assume that neutrinos and antineutrinos are equally distributed among the different flavours , as it is expected due to flavour oscillations ; moreover , we indicate with @xmath109 the probability that a muon neutrino interacting in icecube produces a track event , as it was estimated in @xcite .",
    "this parameter is somewhat uncertain and may be reduced by systematic tracks misidentification error @xcite .",
    "we remark , however , that the specific value of @xmath110 does not alter our main conclusions .",

    "we also see that the north - south asymmetry depends on the considered scenario , being maximal and equal to @xmath115 for _ case c _ , as a result of a more pronounced emission from the inner galactic region . in view of the smallness of the diffuse galactic neutrino contribution",
    ", it appears however unplausible that this component may introduce of a large north - south asymmetry in the complete icecube hese data sample ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) describes the angular resolution , i.e. the probability that a shower ( track ) event with a _ reconstructed _ direction @xmath119 is produced by a a neutrino arriving from the direction @xmath120 . in principle",
    ", the angular resolution depends on the neutrino energy , flavour , direction , etc . here , to avoid unnecessary complications ,",
    "we take constant angular resolution for showers and track events , modeled as @xcite : @xmath121 where @xmath122 , the parameter @xmath123 is a normalization factor , @xmath124 and the widths @xmath125 and @xmath126 are calculated by requiring that @xmath127 at @xmath128 c.l . for showers and @xmath129 at @xmath128 c.l . for tracks @xcite .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "we see that , due to the poor pointing accuracy , the showers produced by diffuse galactic neutrinos are diluted below the isotropic component everywhere in the sky , except for the most favorable _ case c_. on the contrary , the track rate remains dominant in a narrow region of the sky containing the galactic center .",
    "the expected track rate is , however , very small ( see tab .  [ tab1 ] ) making it difficult to obtain a non negligible detection probability .",
    "we can estimate the chance of extracting the diffuse galactic component from the hese icecube data sample , by evaluating the fractional error @xmath130 in the determination of an excess @xmath131 of track or shower events in a specific region of the sky with respect to the expectations @xmath132 in the same region from an isotropic flux .",
    "we obtain : @xmath133 where @xmath122 , the paremeter @xmath134 represents the background - to - signal ratio in the adopted observation window and we neglected systematical error sources .",
    "we consider for definiteness _ case c _ since this is the only scenario in which we obtain a non negligible chance of detection due to the fact that it predicts a larger and more pronounced emission from the inner galactic region . in this specific case ,",
    "the optimal observation window for showers is given by @xmath135 and @xmath136 , for which we obtain : @xmath137 for tracks , the optimal region is given by @xmath138 and @xmath99 for which we have : @xmath139    the above results show that an observation time @xmath140 for showers and @xmath141 for tracks is necessary to obtain @xmath142 hints for a galactic neutrino component , i.e. @xmath143 and/or @xmath144 . for comparison , observation times larger than 35 years and 20 years are required to obtain a comparable significance for _ case a _ and _ case b _ , respectively .",
    "this allow us to conclude that the detection of a statistically significant excess of events from the galactic plane in present ( or next future ) icecube hese data , as e.g. suggested by @xcite , would require relatively large galactic fluxes , favoring scenarios similar to our _ case c _ in which the cr density in the inner galactic region is greatly enhanced with respect to its local value ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the angular dependence of the diffuse galactic neutrino flux and the corresponding icecube hese rate by considering different assumptions for the cr density in the galaxy .",
    "namely , we have assumed that cr distribution is homogenous in the galaxy ( _ case a _ ) , that it follows the distribution of galactic cr sources ( _ case b _ ) and that it has a spectral index that depends on the galactocentric distance ( _ case c _ ) .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in the following :    _ i ) _ in the considered scenarios , the angle - integrated galactic neutrino flux at 100 tev is always subdominant with respect to the isotropic contribution required to fit icecube hese data .",
    "however , it always exists a region of the sky , that contains the galactic center , where the galactic component is comparable or larger than the isotropic contribution .",
    "+ _ ii ) _ while the angle - integrated flux vary at most by a factor @xmath96 , the angular distribution of the diffuse galactic component is strongly dependent on the assumed cr distribution . in perspective",
    ", this provides an handle to discriminate among different scenarios , in an ideal detector with sufficient statistics and good pointing capability ; + _ iii ) _ the poor angular resolution for shower events and the smallness of the expected rate limit the possibility to extract the diffuse galactic neutrino contribution from the icecube hese data . in our analysis , only _ case c",
    "_ has a non negligible chance of detection , due to the fact that it predicts a larger and more pronounced emission from regions close to the galactic center . in the optimal region of the sky given by @xmath135 and @xmath136",
    ", we expect @xmath145 hese events in four years of data - taking that could be observed with @xmath146 significance above the isotropic contribution",
    ". note that the future km3net @xcite should be in better position , having the possibility to observe the inner galactic region with a relatively large exposure by using up - going passing muons ; + _ iv ) _ if a statistically significant excess of events from the galactic plane will be observed in present or next future icecube hese data , as e.g. suggested by @xcite , this would favour models similar to our _ case c _ , in which the cr density in the inner galactic region is much larger than its local value , thus bringing relevant information on the cr radial distribution .",
    "+    as a final remark , since the major obstacle for the detection of diffuse galactic neutrinos in icecube is the smallness of the expected event rates ( at level of @xmath147 at most ) , it would be interesting to explore the possibility of increasing the statistics ( at the level of @xmath148 at least ) by lowering the detection threshold , as it was done e.g. in @xcite and @xcite .",
