    "an unexpected result from radio observations of low mass stars and brown dwarfs was the recent discovery of periodic radio emission tied to the stellar rotation @xcite .",
    "previously thought to be incapable of generating and dissipating strong and stable magnetic fields , observations in recent years indicate that at least 10% of fully convective",
    "late - m and l dwarfs possess stable and large - scale magnetic fields @xcite . when combined with x - ray and h@xmath11 observations @xcite , zeeman broadening of feh molecular lines in stokes @xmath12 @xcite , and spectropolarimetry in stokes @xmath13 ( zeeman doppler imaging : zdi ; @xcite ) , a picture of the magnetic topology of fully convective ultracool dwarfs is now beginning to emerge .",
    "zeeman broadening observations provide a measure the average surface magnetic field , @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the magnetic field and @xmath16 is the covering fraction ) and have been used to study moderately rotating objects as cool as m9 @xcite .",
    "these observations uncovered average magnetic field strengths of up to a few kg . the zdi technique has been used to study the large scale structure and topology of magnetic fields ( as it is sensitive only to the net polarization in stokes @xmath13 ) in objects down to spectral type m8 . at the fully convective boundary ( spectral type of @xmath17 )",
    "these studies hint at a transition from non - axisymmetric toroidal fields to predominantly poloidal , axisymmetric field topologies @xcite , although the systematic uncertainties and general detectability of field topologies across a wide range in stellar parameters are not fully understood .",
    "similarly , there seems to be an increase in the ratio of magnetic fluxes measured in circularly polarized to unpolarized spectral lines at this boundary , apparently confirming that the fully convective objects have increasingly large - scale , low - multipole field topologies .",
    "however , a number of fully convective mid - m dwarfs , potentially belonging to a younger population , still appear to possess small - scale complex fields @xcite , although recent observations seem to question this idea @xcite .",
    "in the context of magnetic activity , the correlation between x - ray and radio emission , which holds across several orders of magnitude in each quantity and over a wide spectral type range @xcite , sharply breaks down around spectral type m7m8 @xcite .",
    "x - ray and h@xmath11 activity also decline precipitously around the same spectral type @xcite .",
    "finally , the h@xmath11 and x - ray rotation - activity relations also break down near the m / l transition @xcite .",
    "the origin of these changes remains unclear , in particular whether they are related to a change in the magnetic dynamo itself , or to a change in the way magnetic energy is released in the cool and largely neutral atmospheres .",
    "radio activity in ultracool dwarfs , on the other hand , appears to be equally strong ( or stronger when normalized to the bolometric luminosity ) than in early - m dwarfs @xcite . among the active population of ultracool dwarfs , the handful of objects with periodic radio emission exhibit diverse behavior . in particular , the wide variation in the temporal behavior , emission bandwidth , and fractional polarization suggest that there are a number of different processes at work . three objects ( tvlm513 - 46546 : @xcite ; lsr1835 + 3259 : @xcite ; and 2m0746 + 2000 : @xcite ) have been observed to emit short - duration , highly polarized pulses with apparently narrow bandwidth . on the other hand , 2m0036 + 1821 exhibits periodic variability with a different structure , rising and falling in a roughly sinusoidal manner @xcite . in all four objects , the observed periods , which range from two to three hours ,",
    "are in close agreement with the known rotation velocities ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "two primary emission mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed radio emission : gyrosynchrotron radiation and the electron cyclotron maser ( ecm ) instability @xcite .",
    "the short - duration periodic pulses have been attributed to a coherent process such as ecm due their small bandwidth and high degree of circular polarization @xcite . however , the mechanism for the sinusoidal radio emission from 2m0036 + 1821 , as well as the quiescent emission from several ultracool dwarfs , is still under debate , partly because of the low levels of circular polarization and the much wider bandwidth .    here we present multi - wavelength observations of a newly discovered radio - emitting m7 dwarf , 2mass j13142039 + 1320011 ( hereafter , m1314 ) , which exhibits unique emission properties among the population of radio active ultracool dwarfs .",
    "it has the brightest radio emission over the widest frequency range of any ultracool dwarf to date ( detected from 1.4 to 22.5 ghz with a nearly flat spectrum ) , and presents the first clear example of sinusoidal emission ( in phase at 4.96 and 8.46 ghz ) .",
    "the periodicity is also detected in circular polarization , including a helicity reversal that provides insight into the topology of the emission regions .",
    "photometric observations reveal periodic variability with the same period as in the radio band , indicative of a large - scale magnetic spot structure .",
    "the unique radio properties of m1314 , and its location at the cusp of the transition in magnetic field properties ( spectral type m7 ) , make it an invaluable laboratory for fully convective dynamos .",
    "we identified the m7 ultracool dwarf m1314  as a radio - emitting source in 2007 during a large very large array ( vla ) survey of nearby mid- and late - m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "it is a high proper motion object ( @xmath19 mas yr@xmath6 , @xmath20 mas yr@xmath6 ; @xcite ) , consistent with the young disk population , and has a parallactic distance of 16.4 pc @xcite .",
    "observations in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands with the lucky imaging technique have demonstrated that it is a resolved binary with a separation of @xmath23 ( about 1.6 au ) , and a companion that is fainter by about 1 mag @xcite .",
    "m1314  has strong h@xmath11 emission , with an equivalent width of @xmath24  , corresponding to @xmath25 @xcite , consistent with the rotationally - saturated level observed in early- and mid - m dwarfs .",
    "we observed m1314  with the vla on several occasions and at several frequencies ( 1.43 , 4.86 , 8.46 and 22.5 ghz ) .",
    "data were acquired as part of programs ab1245 and ab1312 ( pi : berger ) .",
    "the details of the observations are provided in table  [ tab : vla ] .",
    "all observations were obtained in the standard continuum mode with @xmath26 mhz contiguous bands . during the 10 hr simultaneous observation we used fourteen antennas at 4.86 ghz and twelve antennas at 8.46 ghz .",
    "phase calibration was performed using j1309 + 119 , while the flux density scale was calibrated using 3c286 ( j1331 + 305 ) .",
    "we reduced and analyzed the data using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "we inspected the visibility data for quality , and noisy points were removed . in each of the observations a source coincident with the position of m1314  was detected . to search for source variability in the 10-hr simultaneous observation , we constructed light curves by plotting the real part of the complex visibilities at the position of m1314 as a function of time using the aips dftpl routine .",
    "m1314  is also identified in data from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ) survey , where it was observed in december 1999 at 1.43 ghz with a flux density of @xmath27 @xmath28jy .",
    "a comparison of the position in the first data and in our subsequent vla observations in 2009 leads to a proper motion of @xmath29 mas yr@xmath6 and @xmath30 mas yr@xmath6 , in excellent agreement with the known proper motion of m1314 .",
    "we observed m1314  with the 10-antenna very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the green bank telescope ( gbt ) at 8.46 ghz on 2010 april 12 ut for approximately 8 hr ( program bm0327 ; pi : mclean ) .",
    "phase - referenced observations were carried out with a data rate of 512 mbit s@xmath6 in dual polarization , using two - bit sampling .",
    "eight base - band channels of 8 mhz bandwidth each were used , spread over at total base - width of 32 mhz .",
    "the correlator dump time was 1 s. the complex gain calibrator was j1309 + 1154 , located at a distance of @xmath31 from the target .",
    "there is a gap of about 50 min in the resulting light curve of m1314  due to geodetic quasar observations intended to improve the astrometry .",
    "we detected m1314  with a flux density of @xmath32 @xmath28jy at 8.46 ghz with @xmath33 circular polarization .",
    "the source is unresolved with a beam size of @xmath34 mas , corresponding to an upper limit on the source diameter of about 25 stellar radii ( figure  [ fig : vlba ] ) .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude larger than the expected scale of the magnetic field .",
    "the flux density is lower by about @xmath35 from the average of the vla observations , most likely due to a loss of flux caused by phase calibration errors .",
    "we tested this hypothesis by eliminating the longest baselines ( i.e. , reducing the angular resolution ) and recovered the same flux density .",
    "in addition , we searched for potential emission from the secondary star in the system at a level corresponding to the missing flux ( @xmath36 mjy ) but we did not detect any other source above a @xmath37 level of about 0.2 mjy within a @xmath38 region centered on the detected source .      to measure the projected rotation velocity , @xmath39 , we obtained a high - resolution spectrum with the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) spectrograph mounted on the magellan / clay 6.5-m telescope on 2009 may 19 ut . the single 1000 s spectrum was reduced using a custom reduction pipeline written in python .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using thar arc lamps , and air - to - vacuum and heliocentric corrections were applied .",
    "we measured the rotation velocity by cross - correlating the spectrum with a template spectrum of the inactive star gl876 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath39 was determined by comparing the width of the correlation function to cross - correlations between the template and artificially broadened versions of the template spectrum ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we derive @xmath39 from several spectral orders and find @xmath40 km s@xmath6 .",
    "there is no evidence for a spectroscopic binary .",
    "h@xmath11 emission was detected with an equivalent width of 9.9  , corresponding to @xmath41 , lower than previous measurements @xcite .",
    "we also observed m1314  using the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss3 ) on magellan / clay 6.5-m telescope on 2009 february 25 ut .",
    "a total of six 300 s integrations were obtained with the vph - blue grism using a @xmath42 slit .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures in iraf , and the wavelength calibration was performed using henear arc lamps .",
    "we detect non - variable h@xmath11 emission in all the individual spectra with an average equivalent width of @xmath43  , corresponding to @xmath44 .      to study the photometric behavior of m1314  we observed the source on two consecutive nights ( 2010 april 6 and 7 ut ) using keplercam on the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) 1.2-m telescope for about 7 hr on each night .",
    "the observations alternated between the @xmath45- and @xmath21-band filters with individual exposures of 180 and 60 s , respectively .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures in iraf .",
    "relative photometry was performed using the difference imaging photometry pipeline photpipe @xcite .    longer term photometric monitoring ( 2009 january 11 to 2010 march 18 ut )",
    "was performed with a single telescope of the mearth array at the fred lawrence whipple observatory .",
    "mearth consists of @xmath46 identical 0.4-m robotic telescopes , and is dedicated to a search for super - earth exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby mid- to late - m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "all observations were taken with a @xmath47 nm long - pass filter , with the red end of the bandpass defined by the ccd quantum efficiency curve .",
    "exposure times for data taken between 2009 january 11 and june 23 ut were @xmath48 s with the telescope defocused to @xmath49 pixels fwhm ; data between 2009 december 5 and 2010 march 18 ut were obtained with an exposure time of @xmath50 s with the telescope operated in focus .",
    "observations were scheduled at the default @xmath51 min cadence until 2009 june 12 ut when the cadence was increased to @xmath52 min .",
    "on 2010 february 14 ut , we observed for the entire night at the highest possible cadence ( @xmath53 s , including overheads ) .",
    "basic reductions and light curve generation were performed using an automated pipeline , based on the monitor project pipeline @xcite . a number of instrument - specific refinements have been made , and these will be described in full in a forthcoming publication ( berta et al .",
    "2011 , in prep ) .",
    "mearth data have two known systematic effects remaining after the standard pipeline differential photometry corrections , which are of particular importance for the detection of continuous photometric modulations such as rotation , and are detailed in @xcite .",
    "these are the `` meridian offset '' and `` common mode '' effects .",
    "we follow the same method here to correct for these effects , fitting for them simultaneously with the source modulations .",
    "the two initial 1-hr observations of m1314  at 8.46 ghz demonstrate a stable flux density level of about @xmath54 @xmath28jy and stable circular polarization of about @xmath55 . compared to the first detection in 1999 ( at 1.43 ghz )",
    ", the flux density level appears to be stable for a period of about 10 yr .",
    "the 10-hr simultaneous observation obtained about 1.5 yr later allows us to study the short - term temporal variability of the radio emission .",
    "the light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the average flux density is @xmath56 @xmath28jy at 4.86 ghz and @xmath57 @xmath28jy at 8.46 ghz , again indicative of stable long - term radio emission , as well as a flat spectrum .",
    "the corresponding average luminosities are @xmath58 and @xmath59 erg @xmath60 s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 . assuming that the emission comes from the primary object , the ratio relative to the bolometric luminosity is @xmath61 .",
    "this value is about 5 times larger than the brightest radio - emitting m dwarfs detected to date , and roughly comparable with the l3.5 dwarf 2m0036 + 1821 @xcite .",
    "the key feature of the 10 hr observation is the clear periodic variation in the flux density with @xmath62 hr . unlike the periodic radio emission detected in previous ultracool dwarfs ( tvlm513 - 46546 , lsr1835 + 32 , and 2m0746 + 2000 ; @xcite ) , the variation in flux density is smooth and sinusoidal rather than consisting of short - duration pulses .",
    "a lomb - scargle periodogram of the data is shown in figure  [ fig : ls ] , revealing a single significant peak at both frequencies with @xmath63 hr ( 4.86 ghz ) and @xmath64 hr ( 8.46 ghz ) .",
    "this is consistent with a single period of 3.89 hr at both frequencies .",
    "cross - correlation of the two light curves shows that there is no detectable phase shift between the two frequencies , with a @xmath65 upper limit of @xmath66 min , or about @xmath67 ( figure  [ fig : ls ] ) .",
    "we also fit the light curves with a sine - function using a least - squares algorithm , and find @xmath68 hr ( 4.86 ghz ) and @xmath69 hr ( 8.46 ghz ) .",
    "the amplitude of the variation at 4.86 ghz is @xmath70 and at 8.46 ghz it is @xmath71% .",
    "we do not detect obvious periodicity during the 8 hr vlba observation , but note that the noise level in the light curve precludes the detection of variability at the level @xmath55 as observed in the vla observations .    the periodic variability is also detected in circular polarization . at 4.86 ghz , the average polarization during the 10 hr observation is close to zero but it varies at a level of @xmath72 of the total flux density , alternating between right- and left - handed circular polarization over a best fit period of @xmath73 hr from a lomb - scargle periodogram analysis ( figure  [ fig : lspol ] ) .",
    "the periodicity of the circular polarization is correlated with the modulation of the total intensity , with the left - handed polarization coinciding with the peaks in total intensity . at 8.46 ghz",
    "the average polarization is weaker , @xmath74 , with no significant periodicity , although the helicity of polarization may reverse during the peaks of the total intensity ( figure  [ fig : lspol ] ) .",
    "the radio spectral energy distribution ( sed ) between 1.43 and 22.5 ghz is shown in figure  [ fig : bb ] , including all of our vla observations and the first survey data .",
    "unfortunately , only short observations were made at 1.4 and 22.5 ghz , so we have no information about periodicity at these frequencies . if the flux density variations have a similar amplitude to that observed at 4.86 and 8.46 ghz , the measured flux may be biased low or high by about @xmath75 depending on the phase of the light curve probed by these short observations . the broad - band spectrum peaks at about 5 ghz , with a flat spectrum at higher frequencies , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) . for comparison , in figure  [ fig : bb2 ]",
    "we show the multi - frequency data for tvlm513 - 46546 ( m8.5 ) from 1.4 to 8.5 ghz @xcite and denis1048@xmath783956 ( m8 ) from 4.9 to 24 ghz @xcite .",
    "the broad - band sed of m1314  is significantly flatter than that of denis1048@xmath783956 .",
    "the sed of circularly polarized flux is shown in figure  [ fig : bbpol ] , including the full range from the 10 hr observation .",
    "it is unclear if the measurement from the single 1 hr observation at 1.43 ghz represents the true mean polarization or if the object oscillates between right- to left - handed polarization at this frequency as it does at 4.86 ghz .",
    "interestingly , the polarization is consistently positive at 8.46 ghz .",
    "however , the 10 hr observation has the lowest average polarization , indicating a mixture of negative circular polarization related to the overall flux variability .",
    "the level of circular polarization in the vlba detection ( @xmath79 ) is consistent with the vla observations .",
    "the radio emission properties can be used to extract information on the magnetic field strength in the context of the expected emission mechanisms .",
    "the overall low degree of circular polarization , and the wide frequency range over which the radio emission is detected may be indicative of gyrosynchrotron radiation .",
    "however , the nearly flat spectrum corresponds to an electron power law distribution with an energy index of @xmath80 , which is unusually low compared to typical values of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field strength in the case of gyrosynchrotron emission can be estimated using the relation @xmath82 , indicating @xmath83 g for a peak frequency of @xmath84 ghz and a fraction of circular polarization of @xmath85 .",
    "on the other hand , electron cyclotron maser emission , which is produced primarily at the fundamental electron cyclotron frequency , @xmath86 hz , require the magnetic field strength to vary from about 0.5 to 8 kg within the emission region of m1314  to explain the broad - band sed .",
    "we note that the flat spectrum is indicative of an even wider distribution of magnetic field strengths .",
    "the maximal value is much larger than the average surface magnetic field strengths measured on similar objects using zeeman measurements ( @xmath87 kg ; @xcite ) , but it is possible that the zeeman technique is not sensitive to such fields if their spatial scale is relatively small .",
    "the @xmath45- and @xmath21-band light curves from the fwlo 1.2-m observation are shown in figure  [ fig : flwo1 ] . the data exhibit the same periodicity seen in the radio , and the resulting phased light curves ( with @xmath88 hr )",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : flwo2 ] .",
    "the variability amplitude is @xmath89 mmag in @xmath45-band and @xmath90 mmag in @xmath21-band , and both bands are in phase .",
    "a phased light curve from the mearth data is shown in figure  [ fig : mearth1 ] , with a period of @xmath91 hr determined from a lomb - scargle periodogram analysis ( figure  [ fig : mearth2 ] ) .",
    "the variation amplitude in the 715 nm long - pass filter is @xmath92 mmag indicating an overall trend of decreasing variability at longer wavelengths .",
    "the phased light curve is asymmetric , with a longer rise in brightness compared to the subsequent decline ( the rise time from trough to peak is about 2.3 hr , while the decline back to minimum takes about 1.5 hr ) .",
    "the optical period is slightly shorter than the period determined from the vla observations , by @xmath93 min .",
    "this subtle difference may be potentially due to differential rotation if the radio and optical variability arise at different latitudes on m1314 .",
    "the mearth and vla observations could not be phased due to the large gap in the observations .",
    "the overall sinusoidal variability of m1314  points to a large covering fraction for the spot(s ) , while the asymmetry is indicative of multiple or irregularly - shaped spots .",
    "photometric rotational modulation is common in m dwarfs and is generally attributed to magnetic spots .",
    "however , the cool neutral atmospheres of ultracool are expected to also form clouds that may produce periodic variability @xcite . since m1314  is an m7 dwarf , its atmosphere is still fairly warm and dust clouds are less likely .",
    "the ratio of the variability amplitude in the @xmath45 and @xmath21 bands is about 1.6 , which is consistent with a cool spot @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the radio active m8.5 dwarf tvlm513 - 46546 exhibits photometric modulation with the same period as the radio variability , but the @xmath45- and @xmath21-band variations are anti - correlated , indicative of clouds rather than magnetic spots @xcite . here the @xmath45- and @xmath21-band variations are in phase , indicating that magnetic spots are the likely explanation .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether the optical and radio variability are produced by the same active regions or even related magnetic regions .",
    "with a rotation period of 3.89 hr and @xmath5 km s@xmath6 , the minimum radius of m1314  is inferred to be @xmath94 cm ( @xmath95 r@xmath96 ) .",
    "the expected mass for an m7 dwarf @xcite is about @xmath97 m@xmath96 , and the expected radius is therefore about @xmath98 r@xmath96 @xcite .",
    "thus , the inferred radius is larger than predicted , especially if @xmath99 , and this may be indicative of the trend for larger radii than model predictions ( by up to @xmath100 ) for magnetically active ultracool dwarfs @xcite . given that the minimum radius is already @xmath101 larger than the model predictions , this suggests that that inclination is likely @xmath102 .",
    "however , since the binary companion is unresolved in @xmath103-band observations , the magnitude of the primary is difficult to estimate .",
    "@xmath103-band magnitude - mass relations indicate the mass may actually be higher ( @xmath104 m@xmath96 ) and the relatively low temperature may be a result of the inflated radius .",
    "this may resolve some of the discrepancy between the radius and @xmath105 .",
    "the periodic radio emission , and especially the periodic helicity reversals at 4.86 ghz , can be consistently explained with a simple geometric model : a large - scale dipolar magnetic field mis - aligned relative to the rotation axis and with opposite polarity at each pole ; see figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "the inclination of the magnetic axis with respect to the observer leads to a larger projected surface area for one of the poles , and hence an increase in the total intensity when it rotates into view . at 4.86 ghz",
    "we observe a helicity reversal when the other pole is in view .",
    "the fraction of circular polarization remains constant , but may actually be higher than observed if the inclination is such that both spots always remain partially visible . if this is the case , the opposite polarities of the two spots would cause some of the circular polarization to cancel out",
    ". the lack of obvious helicity reversals at 8.46 ghz could be due to changes in the optical depth and the apparent size of the two magnetic poles as a function of frequency , particularly if higher frequencies are emitted near the magnetic foot - points .",
    "this is also supported by the smaller variability amplitude at 8.46 ghz .",
    "the optical periodicity may be caused by cool spots spatially connected with the radio - emitting poles , or by unrelated spots , which are relatively common in m dwarfs .",
    "as noted above , spatial separation and differential rotation may explain the small difference in inferred optical and radio periods .",
    "@xcite propose two distinct magnetic topologies of mid- to late - m dwarfs : large - scale , axisymmetric poloidal topology , and a complex , non - axisymmetric topology .",
    "our geometric model indicates that m1314  has a topology more similar to the large - scale poloidal fields rather than those with complex , small - scale fields .",
    "the reason for these two populations remains unclear , but @xcite propose that objects may transition towards larger - scale poloidal fields with age .",
    "we note , however , that the objects studied in @xcite have much slower rotation velocities ( or correspondingly larger rossby numbers ) than m1314 .",
    "m1314  provides a unique window into magnetically - induced radio emission in ultracool dwarfs , coinciding with the spectral type at which the radio / x - ray correlation breaks down @xcite .",
    "it has the most luminous stable radio emission over the widest frequency range ( @xmath106 ghz ) to date , and furthermore exhibits clear sinusoidal periodicity , with the first example of a helicity reversal in the circularly polarized emission of an ultracool dwarf . taken in conjunction",
    ", these properties point to emission from a simple dipolar field , mis - aligned relative to the stellar rotation axis . in the context of electron cyclotron maser emission",
    ", the magnetic field strength is required to be at least 8 kg .",
    "the inferred field structure is similar to the simple field topologies inferred from zeeman doppler imaging of some fully convective dwarfs @xcite , while the field strength in the case of ecm emission is larger than the typical average fields measured from zeeman broadening of feh lines @xcite .",
    "the stability of the radio emission for at least a decade indicates that the underlying dynamo is stable well beyond the convective turnover timescale for an m7 dwarf ( @xmath107 d ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , a comparison to convective dynamo models and simulations supports predictions of dominant large - scale , low - multipole fields @xcite , particularly for fast rotators @xcite , but is at odds with models that predict small - scale , high - multipole fields @xcite .",
    "future observations of m1314  will address several key questions .",
    "first , if the emission is due to the ecm process , we expect a cut - off in the radio emission at a frequency that corresponds to the maximal field strength , @xmath108 hz",
    ". measurements of this possible cut - off frequency will therefore provide a crucial constraint on the magnetic field since the zeeman techniques are only sensitive to the average surface field or its large - scale component .",
    "the increased sensitivity and bandwidth of the evla , particularly at frequencies of @xmath109 ghz , is well - suited for this test .",
    "second , simultaneous long - term monitoring of the radio and optical emission will test whether the variability has a similar period and phase .",
    "if identical , this will point to an origin in a related magnetic field structure , while a clear difference in period will be suggestive of differential rotation and an origin at different latitudes .",
    "finally , long - term astrometric monitoring with the vlba will be able to uncover a companion down to a few jupiter masses @xcite .",
    "thus , further studies of m1314  are bound to provide new insights into the properties of fully convective dynamos and the release of magnetic energy in the coolest stars and brown dwarfs .",

    "<S> we present multi - epoch radio and optical observations of the m7 dwarf 2mass j13142039 + 1320011 . </S>",
    "<S> we detect a @xmath0 mjy source at 1.43 , 4.86 , 8.46 and 22.5 ghz , making it the most luminous radio emission over the widest frequency range detected from an ultracool dwarf to date . </S>",
    "<S> a 10 hr vla observation reveals that the radio emission varies sinusoidally with a period of @xmath1 hr , and an amplitude of @xmath2 at 4.86 ghz and @xmath3 at 8.46 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the periodicity is also seen in circular polarization , where at 4.86 ghz the polarization reverses helicity from left- to right - handed in phase with the total intensity . </S>",
    "<S> an archival detection in the first survey indicates that the radio emission has been stable for at least a decade . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect periodic photometric variability in several optical filters with a period of @xmath4 hr , and measure a rotation velocity of @xmath5 km s@xmath6 , in good agreement with the radio and optical periods . </S>",
    "<S> the period and rotation velocity allow us to place a lower limit on the radius of the source of @xmath7 r@xmath8 , about @xmath9 larger than theoretical expectations . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the radio emission can be explained with a simple model of a magnetic dipole mis - aligned relative to the stellar rotation axis , with the sinusoidal variations and helicity reversal due to the rotation of the magnetic poles relative to our line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> the long - term stability of the radio emission indicates that the magnetic field ( and hence the dynamo ) is stable on a much longer timescale than the convective turn - over time of @xmath10 yr . </S>",
    "<S> if the radio emission is due to the electron cyclotron maser process , the inferred magnetic field strength reaches at least 8 kg . </S>"
