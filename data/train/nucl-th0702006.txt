    "the hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions provides the condition to investigate the new state of matter of qcd , the so - called quark - gluon plasma(qgp ) @xcite .",
    "the space - time evolution of qgp and its hadronization process are still open questions in the research of this area .",
    "hydrodynamics @xcite based on the assumption of local thermal and chemical equilibrium , models of quark coalescence or recombination @xcite , and fragmentation @xcite are often used to describe the evolution and hadronization of qgp formed in heavy ion collisions at rhic . however , we do not know a priori if the colliding system can reach equilibrium or not .",
    "in fact , because of the very small size and very short lifetime of the collision zone @xcite , the highly excited system may spend a considerable fraction of the lifetime in a non - equilibrium state @xcite . on the other hand , even if the system reaches equilibrium in the early quark - gluon stage , the hadrons formed in the later stage will be in non - equilibrium state , since the particle density in hadron phase is much smaller than that in the parton stage .",
    "evaporation models @xcite developed many years ago are widely used to describe the hadronization of qgp . in some of the models ,",
    "the emission rate is calculated from a simple assumption of balance between the particle emission and absorption in qgp and in hadron gas at a critical temperature @xmath0 . under this assumption",
    ", the particle emission distribution is just the corresponding ideal thermal distribution of hadron gas , @xmath1 .",
    "however , considering the feedback effect of hadron evaporation on qgp , the space - time evolution of qgp and hadron evaporation are coupled to each other and the system is governed by both the hydrodynamic expansion and the evaporation . on the other hand , when the expansion of the system is fast , the fluid will be more likely to split into relatively small bubbles during the hadron evaporation . in this case",
    ", the system is a mixture of qgp bubbles and physical vacuum , and the energy density of the system is lower than that of a unitary qgp .",
    "these bubbles may provide a mechanism to reduce the viscosity of the system and make it more accessible for the ideal hydrodynamics to work at rhic@xcite .",
    "thirdly , from the analysis of collective flow measured at rhic @xcite , the qgp formed at rhic is a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) @xcite where there exist not only quarks and gluons but also some of their resonant states like @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an effective hadronization model for the production of soft particles in relativistic heavy ion collisions . in the model ,",
    "the qgp evolution is described by ideal hydrodynamics together with the equation of state including quarks , gluons and their resonant states . at the critical temperature ,",
    "the expansion does not change the temperature of the system , and the decrease of the energy density is due to the splitting of the qgp fluid . when the energy density reaches the value for hadronization , which is a free parameter in our calculation , the evaporation starts and the hadron distributions are controlled by transport equations .",
    "the evaporation hypersurface is characterized by both the hydrodynamics and the evaporation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we discuss hadron production and transport and derive an approximate emission distribution . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we consider the hydrodynamics for the evolution of qgp with possible splitting into droplets and the effective evaporation boundary condition .",

    "we summarize in section [ s5 ] .",
    "we investigate in this section the transport of hadrons emitted from qgp . the classical transport equation for the evolution of hadron phase space distribution @xmath4",
    "can be written as @xmath5 where the second term on the left hand side is the free streaming part , and on the right hand side the lose and gain terms @xmath6 and @xmath7 indicate hadron absorption and production in qgp , and the elastic term @xmath8 @xcite controls the thermalization of the hadrons .    under the assumption of quasi - static condition , the time evolution @xcite during the transport can be temporarily removed .",
    "if we only focus on a one dimensional hadron transport in the region @xmath9 and treat the elastic scattering in relaxation time approximation , the hadron transport can be greatly simplified , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hadron velocity , @xmath12 the relaxation time parameter , and @xmath13 the thermal hadron distribution . in principle , @xmath12 should depend on the hadron momentum and the type of hadrons . for simplicity , we take it as a universal constant in our global model . considering the finite volumes of hadrons and resonances , the phase space distribution will be suppressed . an effective way to include",
    "the volume effect in the thermal distribution is to multiply @xmath14 by a factor @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ratio of the occupation volume of all the excluded hadrons to the whole volume of the system @xcite . in the following calculation",
    "we will always consider this volume effect for @xmath14 .",
    "the transport equation ( [ trans ] ) can be solved with the analytic result @xmath17e^{-{\\beta(p)\\tau+1\\over \\tau v\\cos\\theta}x}\\ ] ] with @xmath18 defined as @xmath19 it is easy to see that the hadrons reach chemical equilibrium in the limit of vanishing inelastic interactions with @xmath20 and thermal equilibrium in the limit of infinitely strong elastic interaction with @xmath21 . in the both cases ,",
    "the distribution at @xmath22 is reduced to the thermal one , @xmath23    taking into account the boundary condition at @xmath24 , @xmath25 which means no hadrons moving from the vacuum in the region of @xmath26 to the qgp phase in the region of @xmath9 , and the constraint @xmath27 the hadron distribution can be expressed as @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a step function .",
    "it can be seen from the above discussion that the influence of the transport process is mainly reflected in the region near the qgp surface at @xmath24 .",
    "most of the emitted hadrons are created in this region .",
    "since the energy density in the inner part of the qgp fluid is higher than the value on the surface , the hadronization of the qgp fluid can be effectively regarded as a surface evaporation .    in the above derivation",
    "we did not consider the qgp surface shift and the breaking of the fluid in the process of hadron emission . a simple way to take the surface shift and fluid splitting into account is to introduce two parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the model .",
    "the former is the shrinking velocity of the surface , and the latter is the ratio of the occupation volume of all the qgp droplets to the whole volume of the system .",
    "these two parameters should be considered simultaneously in the transport equation for hadron emission and the hydrodynamic equation for qgp evolution . with these two parameters",

    "similarly , the momentum loss of the qgp fluid can be written as @xmath39    if hydrodynamic expansion is neglected , the equation @xmath40 defines a minimal shrinking velocity of the fluid , where @xmath41 is the average energy density at the boundary .",
    "when @xmath41 is small enough to make @xmath42 , the local association between different parts of the fluid will completely vanish , and the fluid must decouple . therefore , the condition for the fluid description of the system is that the energy density must satisfy @xmath43    the question left for the emission distribution of hadrons is the determination of the loss and gain terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
