    "in 1997 a liquid argon time projection chamber ( lartpc ) with a fiducial volume of about 50  l was exposed to the multi - gev wide - band neutrino beam of the cern west area neutrino facility ( wanf )  @xcite , during the nomad  @xcite and chorus  @xcite data taking .",
    "the lartpc was placed on a platform 4.5  m high , between the chorus and nomad detectors .",
    "the modest size of the lartpc fiducial volume ( @xmath050 liters ) made necessary a muon spectrometer downstream the tpc . a coincidence with the nomad daq",
    "was set up to use the detectors located into the nomad magnetic dipole as a spectrometer . during the test @xmath1 p.o.t . were integrated , and about @xmath2 triggers recorded .",
    "the test was run jointly by a group from milano university and the icarus collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the data accumulated in 1997 still offer the unique opportunity of an experimental study on neutrino interactions on ar nuclei . at this time of writing , final results from the experiment have not yet been reported in any systematic fashion ( but see @xcite for preliminary results and a more detailed description of the experimental apparatus ) ; a comprehensive set of results from the 1997 test is presented here for the first time , while a more thorough and final paper is in preparation .",
    "the lartpc had an active volume of 32@xmath332@xmath346.8  @xmath4 , enclosed in a stainless steel vessel in the shape of a bowed - bottom cylinder 90 cm high with a radius of 35 cm .",
    "the active volume contained 67 kg of liquid ar .",
    "ionization electrons produced by the passage of charged particles in liquid ar drift toward the anode under the action of 214  v / cm uniform electric field .",
    "the readout electrodes are two parallel planes of wires running orthogonally ; the planes are at a distance of 4  mm and each plane has 128 wires .",
    "each stainless steel wire has a diameter of 100  @xmath5 m ; the distance between the wires is 2.54  mm .",
    "the ionization electrons drift through the first ( _ induction _ ) wire plane so that the integrated induction signal is zero .",
    "the _ collection _",
    "plane then collects the drifting electrons . the mean charge per unit pitch ( 2.54  mm ) for a m.i.p .",
    "crossing the chamber parallel to the readout planes , corresponds to about @xmath6 electrons ( @xmath04 fc ) .",
    "the chamber has been exposed to the @xmath7 beam produced at the cern wanf .",
    "the primary 450  gev protons from the cern sps were extracted every 14.4  s in two spills ( @xmath8 protons per spill , on average ) of 6  ms duration each and separated by 2.5  s , and hit a segmented be target .",
    "secondaries were selected in momentum and focused by a system of collimators and magnetic lenses .",
    "the experimental area was located 940  m downstream the target .",
    "the mean energy of the @xmath9 reaching the detectors is 24.3  gev , while contaminations from other flavors are below 7% for @xmath10 and @xmath11% for @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the trigger was provided by a set of plastic scintillators , located downstream the chamber before the nomad apparatus .",
    "incoming charged particle were vetoed by 5 large plastic scintillators mounted in front of the chamber and by the last scintillator plane of chorus , which vetoed particles deflected by the chorus magnetic field entering the chamber at large angles with respect to the nominal beam direction .",
    "the local trigger required the coincidence of the sps beam spill , at least one of the trigger scintillators , and the two trigger scintillator planes of nomad ( t1 and t2 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , a trigger was rejected if the nomad acquisition system was in ` busy ` mode or if it came less than 500  @xmath5s after the previous trigger , inhibiting the occurrence of overlapping . in this configuration @xmath13% of the recorded events had a vertex in the fiducial volume of the tpc .",
    "the request of a charged particle triggering the chamber locally and reaching nomad up to t1 and t2 limited the useful data to @xmath9 charged - current interactions .",
    "interactions in the tpc fiducial volume were fully imaged in two 2d images with a common coordinate ( time ) , with full calorimetric information associated with each point .",
    "the common coordinate allows an unambiguous 3d reconstruction of the event , at least for simple topologies .",
    "each 2d - image represents the signal amplitude digitized by the adc ( in a linear gray scale ) versus the time sample ( drift coordinate ) and the wire number .",
    "[ fig : evt ] shows the image of a quasi - elastic ( qe ) event in the induction and collection planes .",
    "units are wire number versus drift time in @xmath5s .",
    "appropriate filtering techniques have been applied to deconvolve the instrumental response and precisely associate the charge deposition to each pixel in the image . for the collection wires",
    "a universal response function has been determined empirically from events in the m.i.p .",
    "sample ( elementary charge deposition ) .",
    "the response was then deconvolved by means of a discrete fourier analysis to reconstruct the topology of the actual charge deposition in the event .",
    "a different approach was adopted for the induction view , where the charge measurement in that view was not accomplished and only the event position , measured by the zero - crossing of the induced signal , was reconstructed .    , with a m.i.p . leaving the tpc fiducial volume and an identified stopping proton .",
    "_ top _ induction view ; _ bottom _ collection view . ]      for a proton , the identification and momentum measurement were performed using only information from the tpc . the discrimination between protons and charged pions",
    "is performed exploiting the different behavior of energy loss as a function of the range . for the case of candidates stopping in the fiducial volume of the chamber , as the ones of the `` golden sub - sample '' considered in sec.[sec : analysis_qe ] ,",
    "the discrimination is highly simplified : it is based on the consistency between the reconstructed kinetic energy from the range and the integrated charge deposited by the candidate along its path - length . for",
    "partially contained candidates , a much better assessment of the charge response of the tpc and of quenching effects@xcite is required , since proton identification is based only on the visible pattern of the energy loss .",
    "such events are not considered here . for fully contained protons ,",
    "the momentum uncertainty is dominated by the finite pitch of the wires .",
    "the equivalent pitch in the vertical direction ( drift direction ) is much smaller due to the high sampling rate of the fast adc ( @xmath15 m ) . for horizontal protons of @xmath16  mev / c the uncertainty is of the order of 7  mev / c .",
    "the angular resolution in the collection or induction view depends on the number of wires @xmath17 hit by the particle along its path ; it is @xmath18 , corresponding e.g. to 15 mrad for n=10 .",
    "the kinematic reconstruction of the outgoing muons exploits the tracking capability of nomad .",
    "an event triggering the chamber will have at least one penetrating track reaching the t1 and t2 trigger scintillators bracketing the trd of nomad  @xcite . the corresponding track , nearly horizontal at the entrance of the nomad drift chamber volume , is reconstructed with an average momentum precision of @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the visible range in the volume itself expressed in meters and @xmath21 the particle momentum in gev . a 10  gev horizontal muon crossing all the chambers ( @xmath22 ) is reconstructed with a precision of 2.2% .",
    "the reconstructed particle is traced back to the tpc accounting for the magnetic field and the presence of the forward nomad calorimeter .",
    "the latter introduces the dominant uncertainty on the muon transverse momentum , due to multiple scattering ( ms ) in iron ( 190  cm for a horizontal muon ) . for small scattering angles ( @xmath23  rad ) the ms uncertainty on the transverse momentum is independent of @xmath21 and it turns out to be @xmath24  mev .",
    "the correctness of the back - tracing procedure has been cross - checked comparing the direction angles of the particles belonging to the m.i.p .",
    "calibration sample as measured by the tpc with the corresponding quantity from nomad .",
    "the commissioning of the detector ended in august 1997 . after that , @xmath25 protons on target have been integrated .",
    "the trigger efficiency was monitored during data taking and its integrated value is 97% .",
    "additional losses are due to the tpc ( 3% ) and nomad ( 15% ) dead time and to detector faults .",
    "the effective livetime was 75% .",
    "81,000 events had been recorded and analyzed by visual scanning .",
    "a minimum - bias sample has been obtained requiring no more than two tracks exiting the chamber and an arbitrary number of contained tracks .",
    "this sample contains the _ golden sample _ of qe interactions and other samples used to validate the simulation for background estimation .",
    "the golden sample consists of events with an identified proton of kinetic energy ( @xmath26 ) larger than 50  mev fully contained in the tpc and one muon whose direction extrapolated from nomad matches the outgoing track in the tpc .",
    "the distance of the interaction vertex from any of the tpc walls has to be greater than 1  cm .",
    "the muon candidate track projected onto the wire plane must be longer than 12 wire pitches .",
    "the event is accepted even in the presence of other stopping particles , as far as their kinetic energy ( in the proton hypothesis ) does not exceed the @xmath26 of the leading proton .",
    "if tracks other than the identified muon leave the tpc or at least one converted photon with energy greater than 10  mev is present in the fiducial volume , the event is rejected .",
    "the tightness of these selections defines a very clear topology for visual scanning ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evt ] ) .",
    "the lower @xmath26 cut combined with the request of containment is very severe since the chamber volume is small . on the other hand , at lower @xmath26 the proton range is comparable with the wire pitch and neither the proton momentum nor the interaction vertex can be reconstructed with due precision .",
    "moreover , for @xmath27 mev the @xmath28/p misidentification probability is negligible .",
    "the golden sub - sample contains pure qe interactions ( @xmath29 ) , an intrinsic background dominated by resonant productions followed by pion absorption in the nucleus ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and an instrumental background due to unidentified @xmath32 s ( @xmath31 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath33 contamination is negligible in this tightly selected sample .    the efficiency of the selections for qe interactions and their intrinsic background has been evaluated by monte carlo experimentation based on the fluka code  @xcite and it turned out to be 17% . similarly , mc provided the inefficiency of the vetoing selections for @xmath34 , i.e. the probability to miss both the decay photons of the @xmath35 or the @xmath36 system in case of @xmath32 dalitz decay .",
    "the corresponding contamination of the golden sub - sample is estimated to be 13% , which can be checked by test samples extracted from the minimum bias events .",
    "the test samples consist of golden events with one ( @xmath37 ) or two ( @xmath38 ) converted photons pointing to the interaction vertex . assuming the gamma identification probability to be uncorrelated for the two photons , we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath17 being the ( unknown ) overall rate of @xmath41 final states and @xmath42 the photon identification efficiency ; @xmath43 turned out to be ( 43@xmath44 9 ) % .",
    "hence , the probability of missing both gammas is ( 32@xmath4410 ) % to be compared with the mc calculation of 20.4% .",
    "accounting for the detector livetime , trigger and selection efficiency and the sample purity , we expect 73.5 events and we observe 61 .       angle for the golden sub - sample .",
    "the continuous red ( green ) line is the expectation from fluka ( saxon - woods ) convoluted with the detector response . ]        in spite of the limited statistics , the golden sub - sample provides informations on the basic mechanisms that modify the kinematics of neutrino - nucleus interactions with respect to the corresponding neutrino - nucleon process .",
    "nuclear matter perturbs the initial state of the interaction through fermi motion ; it also affects the formation of the asymptotic states through nuclear evaporation , hadronic re - scattering or hadronic re - absorption .",
    "several kinematic variables are only marginally affected by nuclear matters ; in this case , the corresponding distributions can be reproduced once the @xmath7-nucleon interaction is corrected for fermi motion and pauli blocking using e.g. a saxon - woods ( sw ) potential for the nucleus where @xmath45 is 0.6  fm ; @xmath46  mev is the maximum well depth and @xmath47 is the nuclear radius ( @xmath48  fm for ar )  @xcite . ] .",
    "clearly , purely leptonic variables belong to this category . fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the distributions of muon energy , muon transverse momentum and the @xmath49 angle .",
    "deviations from expectations are visible only for very low @xmath5 momenta and the corresponding large scattering angles .",
    "@xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , top panel ) is , in principle , strongly influenced by the presence of nuclear matter , but , in practice , the shape of the distribution is determined by the @xmath27  mev cut and the requirement of full containment in the fiducial volume .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] ( top panel ) provide a useful consistency check , and demonstrate that mc reproduces the kinematic selection performed during the scanning and analysis of the golden sub - sample .",
    "other variables embedding the reconstructed kinematics of the protons are sensitive to genuine nuclear effects and should depart from the naive saxon - woods description .",
    "in particular , we analyzed both the acollinearity and the missing transverse momentum of the event ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , middle and bottom panels ) .",
    "the former is defined as @xmath50\\ ] ] @xmath51 and @xmath52 being the transverse momentum components of the proton and @xmath53 and @xmath54 the corresponding quantities for the muon . for pure qe scattering on a nucleon the muon and",
    "the proton has to be back - to - back in the transverse plane so that the acollinearity is zero .    in spite of the limited statistics and the @xmath55% contamination , the imaging capability of the tpc allows to establish empirically the inadequacy of the sw description of the nucleus .",
    "an improved determination of the level of agreement between the theoretical expectations and the data can be obtained from a background subtraction procedure ; this is based on the test samples mentioned in sec.[sec : sel_qe ] .",
    "if the qe analysis is applied to the test sample where a @xmath32 is clearly identified , and the presence of the @xmath32 is then ignored , an artificial acollinearity excess is generated ; in particular , 36% of the sample has @xmath56 .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath57 where 72% of the identified resonance events shows a @xmath57 greater than 400  mev .",
    "the corresponding background subtracted are shown in fig.[fig:3].the kolmogorov probabilities for acollinearity ( transverse momentum ) are 0.52 ( 0.30 ) for fluka and 0.003 ( 0.027 ) for sw .",
    "we discussed the first exposure of a liquid ar tpc to a multi - gev neutrino beam .",
    "the data provided relevant information to experimentally establish the effectiveness of the lar technology in the reconstruction of low - multiplicity neutrino interactions . in spite of the limited size of the detector , nuclear effects beyond fermi motion and pauli blocking",
    "have been observed as perturbations of the quasi - elastic @xmath9 cc interaction kinematics .",
    "we thank the nomad and chorus collaborations for their support during data taking and data analysis . the presenting author ( a.c . ) would like to thank bonnie t. fleming of yale ."
