    "the modulation of the @xmath0-ray light curves at gev energies testifies to the production of @xmath0-ray radiation in the pulsar magnetospheres either at the polar cap ( harding , tademaru , & esposito 1978 ; daugherty & harding 1982 , 1996 ; michel 1991 ; sturner , dermer , & michel 1995 ; shibata , miyazaki , & takahara 1998 ; harding & muslimov 1998 ; zhang & harding 2000 ) , or at the vacuum gaps in the outer magnetosphere ( e.g. , cheng , ho , & ruderman 1986a , b , hereafter chra , b ) . both of these pictures have had some success in reproducing global properties of the observed emission .",
    "however , there is an important difference between these two models : an polar gap accelerator releases very little angular momenta , while outer gap one could radiate them efficiently .",
    "more specifically , the total angular momentum loss rate must equal the energy loss rate divided by the angular velocity of the star , implying an average location of energy loss on the light cylinder ( cohen & treves 1972 ; holloway 1977 ; shibata 1995 ) , of which distance from the rotation axis is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the angular frequency of the neutron star , and @xmath3 the speed of light .    on these grounds ,",
    "the purpose here is to explore a little further into a model of an outer gap , which is located near the light cylinder . if the outer magnetosphere is filled with a plasma so that the space charge density is equal to the goldreich - julian density , @xmath4 , then the field - aligned electric field vanishes , where @xmath5 is the component of the magnetic field along the rotational axis .",
    "however , the depletion of charge in the goldreich and julian model in a region where it could not be resupplied , may cause a vacuum region to develop .",
    "holloway ( 1973 ) pointed out the possibility that a region which lacks plasma is formed around the surface on which @xmath6 changes its sign .",
    "subsequently , chra , b developed a version of an outer magnetospheric @xmath0-ray emission zone in which acceleration in the holloway gaps above the null surface , where @xmath5 vanishes , brought particles to large lorentz factors ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "after chra , b , many outer - gap models have been proposed ( chiang & romani 1992 , 1994 ; romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ; romani 1996 ; zhang & cheng 1997 ; cheng , ruderman & zhang 2000 ) .",
    "their basic idea is as follows : a deviation of the charge density from @xmath8 results in an electric field along the magnetic field , @xmath9 .",
    "if this electric field becomes strong enough to accelerate @xmath10 pairs to ultrarelativistic energies , they could radiate @xmath0-rays tangential to the curved @xmath9 field lines there .",
    "the curvature @xmath0-rays may be converted into @xmath10 pairs via two photon collisions . in order to keep a steady current flow and the charge density @xmath8 in the regions outside the gap",
    ", the gap will grow until it is large enough and the electric field is strong enough to maintain a sufficient supply of charges to the rest of the open field line region .",
    "if the gap ends in a region where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , charges from the surrounding region may flow in through the end ( or the boundary ) . if both boundaries are located on the null surface , pairs produced in the gap will replace the charge deficiency inside the gap , and finally the gap will be filled up .",
    "however , if a vacuum gap extends to the light cylinder , the charged particles created in the gap should escape from the magnetosphere , so the gap would not be quenched .",
    "hence , stable outer gaps ( if they exist ) are those from the null surface to the light cylinder along the last - open field lines . in an outer gap , the inner boundary lies near the intersection of the null surface where @xmath8 vanishes and the boundary of the closed field lines of the star on which the magnetospheric current does not exits .    recently , solving the vlasov equations that describe a stationary pair production cascade , hirotani and shibata ( 2001a , b , papers vii and viii ) elucidated important characteristics of the particle acceleration zones in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "they demonstrated that a stationary gap does not extend between the null surface and the light cylinder .",
    "rather , their width ( @xmath13 ) along the field lines is adjusted so that a single particle emits copious @xmath0-rays one of which materialize as a pair in the gap on average .",
    "the resultant @xmath13 becomes about @xmath14 of @xmath15 in the case of the crab pulsar .",
    "the produced pairs in the gap do not completely cancel the acceleration field , because the particles do not accumulate at the gap boundaries .",
    "outside of the gap , the particles flows away from the gap along the magnetic field lines as a part of the global current flow pattern . in another word ,",
    "the remained , small - amplitude electric field along the magnetic field lines outside of the gap prevents the gap from quenching .",
    "moreover , they demonstrated that the gap position is not fixed as considered in previous outer gap models .",
    "their position shifts as the magnetospheric current flowing the gap changes .",
    "that is , if there is no particle injection across either of the boundaries , the gap is located around the null surface , as demonstrated in their earlier papers ( hirotani & shibata 1999a , b , c , papers  i , ii , iii ; hirotani 2000a , b , c , papers  iv , v , vi ; see also beskin et al .",
    "1992 and hirotani & okamoto 1998 for a pair - production avalanche in a black - hole magnetosphere ) .",
    "however , the gap position shifts towards the light cylinder ( or the star surface ) if the injected particle flux across the inner ( or the outer ) boundary approaches the goldreich - julian value . in other words , the accelerator can be located at any place in the magnetosphere ; their position is primarily constrained by the magnetospheric current .    in papers  vii and viii",
    ", they examined the outer gaps formed in the magnetospheres of young or millisecond pulsars , assuming a sub - goldreich - julian particle injection across the boundaries . in this paper , we apply the same method to a middle - aged pulsar b1055 - 52 and demonstrate that a stationary gap is maintained even if the injected particle flux exceeds the goldreich - julian value , and that the possibility of such a large particle flux injection is ruled out if we compare the predicted @xmath0-ray spectrum with observations .",
    "in the next section , we formulate the basic equations describing the stationary pair production cascade in the outer magnetosphere . in   3 ,",
    "we apply the method to a middle - aged pulsar , b  1055 - 52 and reveal that large magnetic inclination and a sub - goldreich - julian current are plausible for the outer - magnetospheric accelerator for this pulsar . in the final section ,",
    "we compare the results with previous works .",
    "we first consider the continuity equations of particles in   [ sec : cont ] , the @xmath0-ray boltzmann equations in   [ sec : boltz_gamma ] , and the poisson equation for the electrostatic potential in   [ sec : poisson ] .      under the mono - energetic approximation",
    ", we simply assume that the electrostatic and the curvature - radiation - reaction forces cancel each other in the boltzmann equations of particles .",
    "then the spatial number density of positrons ( @xmath16 s ) and electrons ( @xmath17 s ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , obey the following continuity equations : @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",

    ", we consider that a positive electric field arises in the gap . in this case , positrons ( or electrons ) are migrating outwardly ( or inwardly ) .",

    "x - ray number density between dimensionless energies @xmath48 and @xmath49 , is integrated over @xmath48 from the threshold energy @xmath50 to infinity .    to evaluate @xmath51 between the surface x - rays and the @xmath0-rays , we must consider @xmath0-ray s toroidal momenta due to the aberration of light .",
    "it should be noted that a @xmath0-ray photon propagates in the instantaneous direction of the particle motion at the time of the emission .",
    "therefore , evaluating the @xmath0-ray toroidal velocity at the gap center , we obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the collision angle between the surface x - rays and the curvature @xmath0-rays , that is , the angle between the two vectors ( @xmath38,@xmath39 ) and ( @xmath54,@xmath55 ) at the gap center",
    ". therefore , the collision approaches head - on ( or tail - on ) for inwardly ( or outwardly ) propagating @xmath0-rays , as the gap shifts towards the star .      unlike the charged particles",
    ", @xmath0-rays do not propagate along the magnetic field line at each point , because they preserve the directional information where they were emitted . however , to avoid complications",
    ", we simply assume that the outwardly ( or inwardly ) propagating @xmath0-rays dilate ( or constrict ) at the same rate with the magnetic field ; this assumption gives a good estimate when @xmath56 holds . under this assumption ,",
    "we obtain ( paper  vi ) @xmath57 where ( e.g. , rybicki , lightman 1979 ) @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 is the curvature radius of the magnetic field lines and @xmath62 is the modified bessel function of @xmath63 order .",

    "it is worth mentioning that the gap width , @xmath13 , is related with the x - ray field density as follows ( for details , see papers  v , vii , and viii ) : @xmath145 where @xmath146 refers to the pair production optical depth , and @xmath147 the expectation value of the @xmath0-ray photons emitted by a single particle while it runs the gap .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : closure ] ) is automatically satisfied by the stationary vlasov equations .",

    "for example , for middle - aged pulsars , the x - ray field is much less dense compared with the magnetospheric x - ray field of young pulsars .",
    "we can therefore expect that the gap is more extended ( i.e. , @xmath13 is greater ) for middle - aged pulsars than the young pulsars , because the former s larger @xmath146 leads to a larger @xmath13 , compared with the latter .",

    "mignani , caraveo , and bignami ( 1997 ) claimed that the blue / uv flux is consistent with an extrapolation of the soft , thermal part of the rosat x - ray spectrum .",

    "this ir photon field is , in fact , so weak that the ic drag acting on a particle is negligibly small compared with the curvature drag , as the tev / gev flux ratio ( @xmath156 ) indicates in the following subsections .",

    "this is because @xmath13 increases with increasing @xmath133 ( fig .",

    "[ sec : j1=j2_b1055][sec : out_b1055 ] .",
    "the curvature spectrum becomes the hardest when @xmath162 . in this case , the gap is located close to the null surface , where @xmath171 vanishes .",
    "= 8.5 cm      it has been revealed that the @xmath0-ray spectrum becomes hardest when the injected current is small ( say , when @xmath202 ) and that the egret spectrum can not be explained for @xmath167 ( as the solid line in figs .",
    "[ fig : spc_1055_60_01_j1=j2 ] , [ fig : spc_1055_60_01_00_j2 ] , or [ fig : spc_1055_60_01_j1_00 ] indicates ) .",
    "since the @xmath0-ray energies are predicted to increase with increasing @xmath203 in paper  v , we examine in this section whether the egret pulsed flux around 6  gev can be explained if consider a larger @xmath203 . in figures  [ fig : ell_1055_4inc ] and [ fig : spc_1055_4inc ] , we present the acceleration fields and the expected spectra for @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 as the dash - dotted , dashed , solid , and dotted lines . the current densities are chosen as @xmath180 , @xmath162 . in each case , the outwardly propagating @xmath0-ray flux is depicted , because it is greater than the inwardly propagating one .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    it follows from figure  [ fig : spc_1055_4inc ] that a large inclination angle ( @xmath205 or greater ) is preferable to explain the @xmath0-ray spectrum around 6  gev .",
    "the reasons are fourfold ( see also   6.2 in paper  vii ) : + @xmath208   the distance of the null surface from the star decreases with increasing @xmath203 .",
    "+ @xmath208   the magnetic field strength , and hence the goldreich - julian charge density , @xmath209 , in the gap increases as the distance from the star decreases .",
    "+ @xmath208   it follows from the poisson equation  ( [ eq : poisson_0 ] ) that the derivative of @xmath174 ( i.e. , @xmath210 ) increases with increasing @xmath171 ( i.e. , with decreasing distance from the star ) .",
    "+ @xmath208   by virtue of this increasing derivative , the acceleration field , @xmath174 , at the gap center increases .",
    "we may notice here that @xmath13 does not decrease very rapidly with increasing @xmath203 , because of the negative feedback effect due to the @xmath147 factor in equation  ( [ eq : closure ] ) .",
    "as a result of this increased @xmath174 , the spectrum becomes hard for a large @xmath203 .",
    "it is worth noting that the tev flux is always negligibly small compared with the observational upper limit .",
    "this is because the infrared flux , which is deduced from the rayleigh - jeans side of the soft surface blackbody spectrum , declines sharply as @xmath211 at small frequency , @xmath212 .",
    "we have assumed that the distance is @xmath213  kpc so that the observed area of the soft blackbody emission , @xmath214 , may be less than @xmath155 . in this section",
    ", we consider the case when the distance is @xmath215  kpc , as indicated by taylor , manchester and lyne ( 1993 ) , and compare the results with @xmath216  kpc case .    in figure",
    "[ fig : s1055dist ] , we present the resultant spectra for @xmath204 , @xmath180 , and @xmath162 . the solid ( or dashed ) line represents the @xmath0-ray spectrum when the distance is @xmath213  kpc ( or @xmath215  kpc ) .",
    "the normalization is adjusted by the fluxes below @xmath213  gev ; @xmath217 ( or @xmath218 ) is assumed for @xmath216  kpc ( or @xmath215  kpc ) .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : s1055dist ] that the gev spectrum becomes hard if we assume a smaller distance , @xmath152 .",
    "the conclusion that a small distance to this pulsar is preferable , is derived , because the less dense x - ray field for a smaller @xmath152 results in a larger @xmath146 in equation  ( [ eq : closure ] ) , and hence in a larger @xmath13 and the acceleration field , @xmath174 .",
    "however , the solution does not vary so much if the x - ray density increases @xmath219  times .",
    "this is due to the negative feedback effect caused by the @xmath178 factor in equation  ( [ eq : closure ] ) ; that is , the increase of @xmath13 is substantially canceled by the increase of @xmath147 , which is proportional to the product of the curvature - radiation rate of a particle per unit length and @xmath13 . in other words",
    ", the solution exists for a wide range of parameters and does not change very much if the variation of the x - ray field density is within one order of magnitude .",
    "in summary , we have developed a one - dimensional model for an outer - gap accelerator in the magnetosphere of a rotation - powered pulsar . solving the vlasov equations that describe a stationary pair - production cascade",
    ", we revealed that the accelerator shifts towards the star surface ( or the light cylinder ) as the particle injection rate across the outer ( or inner ) boundary approaches the goldreich - julian value . applying this theory to a middle - aged pulsar , b1055 - 52",
    ", we find that stationary solutions exist for a wide range of parameters such as the injected currents , magnetic inclination , and the distance to the pulsar .",
    "comparing the expected spectrum with erget observations , we conclude that a sub goldreich - julian current density , a large magnetic inclination , and a small distance ( 500  pc , say ) are preferable for this pulsar .      as demonstrated in   6.3 in paper  vii ,",
    "the spin - down luminosity of a rotation - powered pulsar becomes ( see   6.3 in paper vii ) @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the neutron star s magnetic dipole moment ; @xmath222 represents the ratio of magnetic fluxes along which currents are flowing and those that are open . for psr  b1055 - 52 , @xmath223 . if all the open field lines are active ( i.e. , @xmath224 ) , @xmath225 is required so that the observed spin - down luminosity @xmath226 may be realized . if a small fraction of open field lines are active ( i.e. , @xmath227 ) , a super - goldreich - julian current ( i.e. , @xmath228 ) is required",
    ".    however , our outer - gap model requires ( and , in fact , previous outer - gap models assume ) @xmath229 .",
    "thus the deficient current must flow along the open field lines that are not threading the accelerator .",
    "let us compare the present methods and results with paper  v. in the present paper , @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 were solved from the vlasov equations for a non - vacuum gap , while in paper  v only @xmath230 field was solved from the poisson equation for a vacuum gap , with the aid of the closure condition  ( [ eq : closure ] ) , where @xmath233 was assumed . since the condition  ( [ eq : closure ] ) is automatically satisfied by the vlasov equations , the electrodynamics solved in this paper ( e.g. , @xmath13 , @xmath230 ) are essentially the same with paper  v , provided that the gap is nearly vacuum ( i.e. , @xmath229 ) .",
    "for example , the peak energy of curvature radiation is predicted to be about @xmath234  gev for @xmath235 in paper  v , which is comparable with the @xmath236 peak of the dotted line in figure  [ fig : spc_1055_4inc ] .",
    "it also follows from figure  [ fig : spc_1055_4inc ] that the peak energy does not strongly depend on @xmath203 ; this conclusion is consistent with what was obtained for middle - aged pulsars in paper  v ( see table  3 ) . in the present paper , we can more accurately predict the @xmath0-ray spectrum , which is divided into 11 energy bins , compared with the gray approximation adopted in paper  v. for example , the @xmath0-ray spectrum is predicted to decline very sharply above @xmath237  gev ( fig .  [",
    "fig : spc_1055_4inc ] ) even for a large @xmath203 ( @xmath238 , say ) .",
    "we finally compare the present work with the numerical simulation performed by smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who examined equilibrium charge distributions in the magnetosphere of an aligned rotator . in the first place",
    ", they demonstrated that the goldreich - julian charge distribution is unstable and collapses to form a polar dome containing plasma of one charge and an equatorial belt containing plasma of the other sign : @xmath239 inside both of them .",
    "these are separated by a vaccum gap in which @xmath240 holds .",
    "to apply the theory developed in the present paper to the case when the goldreich - julian charge distribution breaks down , we must modify the poisson equation  ( [ eq : poisson_0 ] ) ( or eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : basic-1 ] ] and [ eq : basic-2 ] ) so that the electric field caused by the charges in the dome and the belt may be taken into account .    in the second place ,",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) demonstrated that the creation of electron - positron pairs in the gap between the dome and the belt reduces the value of @xmath241 in the gap so that it turns off at last .",
    "this is because the charges are attracted to regions of the same sign , following the closed field lines , and increasingly filling the magnetosphere . instead ,",
    "as considered in the present paper , if pairs are created in the open field line region , we may expect global flows of charged particles and hence a stationary pair production cascade in the magnetosphere of a spinning neutron star .",
    "if we extend the work by smith et al ( 2001 ) into oblique rotators and apply the present method to the gap , we may construct a stationary magnetospheric model with pair production cascade under the existence of global currents .",
    "there is room for further investigation on this issue .",
