    "most of the times since their discovery , more than 40 years ago , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbh ) have been considered rare and exotic objects with peculiar ( and extreme ) astrophysical properties . in the past decade , studies in the local universe established the presence of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of virtually all galaxies with a bulge / spheroidal component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; changing dramatically the perception of this class of objects . since cosmological smbh growth is mostly due to accretion of matter during their active phases @xcite , we are led to conclude that most bulges went through a phase of strong nuclear activity @xcite . moreover , as the energy released in the process of accretion on the smbh can be higher than the total binding energy of a massive galaxy , agn may represent a key ingredient of the formation and evolution of all galaxies . if , and how , the nuclear black holes influence their host galaxies , and vice - versa , became a major focus in studies of structure formation and evolution .    indeed",
    ", many observational discoveries do support the notion of a close link between smbh growth and the assembly of the host galaxy .",
    "the most crucial ones are the following : ( i ) the tight correlation between the central smbh mass and various properties of their host galaxies i.e. luminosity : @xcite , stellar mass @xcite , and velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "( ii ) as populations , smbhs and galaxies seem to evolve with redshift in a similar way . in fact",
    ", the agn evolution is luminosity - dependent with low - luminosity agn reaching the peak in their space density later in the history of the universe ( i.e. at lower redshift ) than higher luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "this pattern is similar to the so - called `` cosmic downsizing '' of star forming galaxies @xcite seen also in the spheroid galaxies @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the shape of the integrated agn activity over cosmic time is similar to the one of the global star formation rate ( sfr ) with a peak at z@xmath02 and a rapid decline at both lower ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and higher ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) redshift .",
    "( iv ) finally , luminous agn show a correlation between the agn bolometric luminosity and the star formation ( sf ) of the host galaxy over more than five orders of magnitude in luminosity @xcite , albeit with a substantial scatter ; possible deviation from such a behavior have however been reported for lower luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "while the evidences of a tight link between the formation of galaxies and the growth of the smbhs at their centers are many and clear , the physical processes behind this interplay remain unclear . in particular , the fundamental question of whether agn - driven feedback processes are ultimately responsible for determining global properties of the galaxy population ( e.g. luminosity functions , color - magnitude distributions and the evolution thereof ) or , on the contrary , they happen to be triggered and fueled as a by - product of star - formation activity and morphological evolution of their hosts still remains unanswered .",
    "this is of fundamental importance for understanding both galaxy assembly and the accretion density of the universe .",
    "the work we present here is indeed motivated by the desire to obtain robust , and statistically significant , constraints on the possible scenarios for the co - evolution of galaxies and agn .    a slew of models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been developed in recent years to explain this co - evolution and to describe the main mechanism that fuel the central smbh and build the galaxies bulge .",
    "some of these semi - analytical models and hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) invoke major mergers of gas - rich galaxies as the main fueling mechanism .",
    "alternative mechanisms have been discussed in the literature , including minor - mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , disk instabilities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and recycled gas from dying stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "different fueling mechanisms are usually associated to different luminosity ranges e.g. major mergers are invoked to trigger bright quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the role of major mergers in triggering more typical ( @xmath8 ) agn is called into question ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the contrary",
    ", secular processes seem to be enough to fuel low luminosity agn i.e. seyfert - like objects @xcite . due to the large mismatch in physical scales between agn and galaxies ,",
    "all these models have to rely on specific assumptions regarding the mechanism responsible for the link between the nuclear activity , which releases most of its energy on the scale of few schwarzschild radii @xmath9 ( @xmath0 10@xmath10 pc ) , and the stellar population on much larger scales ( @xmath0 a few kpc , some @xmath11 times @xmath9 ) .",
    "this mechanism is in most cases an energetic feedback from the central engine that deposits the energy liberated by the accretion process within the host galaxy , or its dark matter halo @xcite the physical description of the feedback itself and its effect on the agn host galaxy is , however , very different among different models .",
    "in particular , due to the complex interplay between gas inflow , outflow and nuclear obscuration during active agn phases , a correct and complete identification of unobscured , obscured , and highly obscured agn at all redshifts ( and especially in the @xmath12 interval , where most of the feedback is expected to happen ) is therefore crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the still little explored phase of the common growth of smbhs and their host galaxies .",
    "generally speaking , two different approaches can be followed to test the predictions of different theoretical models of agn feedback and to constrain the physical mechanisms at play : a detailed study of the physical properties of relatively small but well defined samples of selected sources or a statistical investigation of a large sample of agn which includes different sub - classes . within the cosmos survey",
    ", the first approach has been followed in our previous papers ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the latter approach is adopted here .",
    "to study growing smbhs and their influence on the host galaxies over different periods of their cosmic evolution , one needs to compile a sample of agn ( both unobscured and obscured ) as complete as possible , spanning a wide range in luminosity and redshift .",
    "x - ray surveys have been proved to be the most efficient way to compile nearly unbiased samples of compton thin agn @xcite , but they may miss compton thick agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the optical spectroscopic selection , even though allowing a straightforward selection of unobscured agn and being less biased against compton thick agn , can fail to select those agn for which the nuclear optical / ir light is diluted by their host galaxy . to overcome these limitations , we decided to consider and combine x - ray and optically selected agn samples compiling a highly homogeneous and representative sample of obscured and unobscured agn selected in the cosmos field over a wide redshift baseline ( 0@xmath13z@xmath134 ) .",
    "other selections criteria ( e.g. from ir color - color diagrams , @xcite , or from radio surveys , e.g. @xcite ) may provide additional agn and are needed in order to get a full picture on the agn - galaxy co - evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , since x - ray and optical selections make up more than 50% of the full agn population in cosmos ( brusa et al . in prep ) for the purpose of this paper we will focus on only these two methods quantifying , whenever relevant , the incompleteness due to the not inclusion of the other samples .    the major observational challenge in any comprehensive study of the agn - galaxy co - evolution is the accurate separation of the agn and galaxy emission components , at all optical - ir wavelengths .",
    "this is a crucial step for a number of reasons : depending on the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of the nuclear ( agn ) and of the stellar light , and of their respective level of extinction , inaccurate de - blending might not only hamper any precise determination of the galaxies physical properties , but also mask agn signatures and bias our view of the smbh growth .    to this end , we used a two - component spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting procedure .",
    "the observed sed is fitted with a large grid of models based on a combination of the @xcite agn template and several host - galaxy models ( i.e. synthetic spectra created from the stellar population synthesis models of * ? ? ?",
    "given the wide multi - wavelength coverage available in the cosmos field , this fitting technique allows to decompose , typically with a high level of confidence , the entire sed into nuclear agn and host galaxy components and to derive robust measurements of the host galaxy physical properties , e.g. rest - frame colors , stellar mass , k - band luminosity and star formation rate .",
    "the strength of the sed fitting method is that , given sufficiently wide photometric coverage , it is applicable to all agn , obscured and unobscured , independent of their luminosity . in particular , once a comprehensive set of templates for the sed components is chosen , the method can be applied ( almost ) blindly to any detected object in a multi - wavelength survey , irrespective of the specific selection criteria , reaching an accuracy that depends crucially on the number of bands and depth of the available photometric catalogs . in this respect , cosmos is a uniquely suited field for our investigation .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : sample ] we will introduce our sample , before proceeding to a discussion of the 2-component sed fitting method in section [ sec : sed ] . in section [ sec : galprop ] we will discuss the physical properties of the agn host galaxies ( i.e. colors , masses and sfrs ) compared to normal galaxies focusing in section [ sec : agnfr_mass ] and [ sec : agnfr_sfr ] on the incidence of the agn as a function of their host properties i.e. mass and star - formation rate , respectively .",
    "a final discussion and a summary of our main results are presented in section [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : summary ] . additionally , in appendix [ sec:1component ] we discuss the effect on the derived host galaxy properties if the agn component is not properly subtracted , while appendix [ sec : sfr ] shows a detailed comparison between two sfr indicators i.e. uv - optical sed fitting and the fir bands based method . in appendix",
    "[ sec : table ] two tables with the agn catalog and the parameters derived from the sed fitting ( e.g. rest - frame magnitudes , masses and sfrs ) can be found together with a short explanation of the columns .",
    "these tables show only 16 lines as an example of the ones published online . throughout this paper , we use the standard cosmology ( @xmath14=0.3 , @xmath15=0.7 , with h@xmath16=70 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) . magnitudes , if not differently specified , are ab magnitudes .",
    "in order to construct a sample of agn as complete as possible , including both obscured and unobscured objects , we first selected xmm - cosmos point - like sources @xcite , to which we added a smaller sample of purely optically selected agn from the zcosmos bright spectroscopic survey @xcite , spanning a lower agn luminosity range ( @xcite , mignoli et al . in prep ) . in this section , we give the details of our sample selection .",
    "the xmm - cosmos catalog includes @xmath01800 point - like x - ray sources .",
    "the x - ray catalog has been presented in @xcite , while the optical identifications and multi - wavelength properties have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the sources of the xmm - cosmos catalog of @xcite have been classified as normal galaxies , obscured and unobscured agn according to their properties , i.e. x - ray luminosities , spectra and multi - wavelength seds @xcite ; here we consider only those sources classified as agn , both unobscured and obscured , as we describe below .",
    "optical spectra are available for more than half of the sample from different instruments : vimos / vlt ( zcosmos project , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , imacs / magellan @xcite , mmt @xcite , and deimos / keckii ( p.i .",
    "scoville , capak , salvato , kartaltepe , mobasher ) .    from the xmm - cosmos subsample for which spectra are available",
    ", we identified 430 sources which show broad ( fwhm@xmath172000 km s@xmath4 ) emission lines in their optical spectra , which we classify as type1 ( unobscured ) .",
    "further 402 spectroscopically confirmed agn were instead classified as type2 ( obscured ) , by making use of both their spectral properties and x - ray luminosities .",
    "in particular , the type2 agn class includes : ( a ) all the sources that do not show broad emission lines and for which the ratio between their high - ionization narrow lines indicates agn activity @xcite and ( b ) in case the high ionization lines are not detected in the observed wavelength range , all the objects without broad lines and with rest - frame ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray luminosity greater than 2@xmath18 erg s@xmath4 .    for about half of the xmm - cosmos sources ( 723 objects ) , only photometric",
    "redshifts are available ( the `` photo - z '' agn sample ) , which are however very accurate with @xmath190.015 and a fraction of outliers of just 5.8% @xcite .",
    "thus , the xmm - cosmos sources for which no spectra are available have been classified as unobscured type1 in 172 cases , and as obscured type2 in 551 cases . in practice ,",
    "the source classification for `` photo - z '' agn was performed as in @xcite on the basis of the template that best describes their sed , and applying the same threshold in x - ray luminosity ( @xmath20 kev}>2 \\times 10^{42}$ ] erg s@xmath4 ) .",
    "summarizing , the xmm - cosmos sample analyzed in this work comprises 602 unobscured type1 agn ( 430 with spectroscopic redshift and broad emission lines ; 172 with photometric redshift ) and 953 obscured type2 agn ( 402 with spectroscopic redshift and 551 with photometric redshift ) , for a total of 1555 x  ray selected agn .     & + & x - ray&optbpt&optnev&xray + x - ray&*360*&18&28&*551 * + optbpt&18&*105*&11 & + optnev&28&11&*95 * & +   +   + & & + x - ray & & +      for type1 agn the x - ray and optical selection match very well , i.e. in addition to the 430 spectroscopic broad line agn with xmm detection , there are only 25 ( @xmath06% ) objects purely optically selected from the zcosmos bright survey which are not detected in the x - ray band by xmm ( the number goes down to just 14 , @xmath03% , if we consider also chandra detections ) .",
    "this is not the case for obscured type2 agn , for which a more substantial fraction ( @xmath1725% ) can be selected from optical surveys showing no x - ray counterparts .",
    "moreover , while the redshift and luminosity distribution of x - ray and optically selected type1 agn is very similar , for type2 objects this is not the case and different bands can allow us to retrieve different sub - classes of sources .",
    "for this reasons , we include in this study also obscured type2 agn selected purely on optical properties . since optically selected agn ( seyfert2 galaxies ) tend to have much lower luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : agnlum ] ) this allows us to enlarge the analyzed luminosity range .",
    "the sample of optical type2 agn was selected in the following way : from the final 20000 vimos / vlt zcosmos bright , and in analogy with the procedure adopted in @xcite for the first 10000 spectra ( 10k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have selected 392 sources using the standard diagnostic diagrams ( /  versus /  and /  versus / , * ? ? ?",
    "* bpt diagram ) to isolate agn in the redshift range 0.15@xmath210.45 and the diagnostic diagram /  versus /  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "*  blue  diagram ) to extend the selection to higher redshift ( 0.5@xmath210.92 ) .",
    "these diagnostic diagrams allow the classification of emission line objects as seyfert2 galaxies , candidate seyfert2 galaxies , and liners . here",
    "we include only the 105 objects classified as secure seyfert2 galaxies ( the liner sample is studied separately in * ? ? ?",
    "of these 105 agn , 18 have x - ray counterparts and therefore are already included in the x - ray selected sample described above . hence , from the optical selection based on the spectral diagnostic diagrams , we isolated 87 pure optically selected seyfert2 which do not show any x - ray emission at the depth of our xmm observations .",
    "a relatively new method to select obscured agn in the optical surveys uses the detection of  line whose presence is a distinctive feature of agn activity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "using this criterion on the same 20000 zcosmos bright spectra , mignoli et al .",
    "( in prep ) identified 95 obscured type2 agn , 11 of which were already identified through the emission line diagnostic diagrams . of the remaining 84 sources , 24",
    "have x - ray counterparts and are hence already included in the x - ray selected sample described above . from the -based optical selection",
    ", we thus isolated additional 60 pure optically selected seyfert2 which do not show any x - ray detection .    in total , the optically selected obscured agn amount to 189 sources , of which 147 are purely optically selected with no xmm detection area of cosmos , in this paper we limit the x - ray analysis to the xmm - cosmos sample .",
    "since both these two criteria are based on spectral features , the number of spectra available for obscured agn is artificially higher than for the unobscured ones .",
    "the final combined sample analyzed in this paper consists of 1702 agn : 602 type1 agn ( of which 430 with optical spectra ) and 1100 type2 agn ( of which 549 have spectra ) . a graphical representation of the sample and its basic substructure , highlighting classification , the method used , and overlaps among the various sub - samples , is shown in figure  [ fig : sample ] and in table [ tab : sample ] .",
    "the color code adopted in fig .  [ fig : sample ] will be used throughout the entire paper : blue and red colors will denote x - ray unobscured and obscured agn , respectively ; green those seyfert2 galaxies selected optically using the diagnostic diagrams , and yellow the obscured agn selected via line emission .",
    "open and filled symbols are used instead for photometric and spectroscopic redshifts , respectively .",
    "the full sample can be found in the online material .",
    "an example of the published table is given in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "since the aim of this work is to study the agn host galaxy properties and compare them to normal galaxies , throughout this paper we will use the irac selected galaxy sample in the cosmos area as comparison `` parent '' galaxy sample . for the whole galaxy sample photometric redshifts , masses and star - formation rates are available @xcite .",
    "moreover , in order to disentangle multiple dependencies and thus isolate the real differences in the properties of galaxies hosting an agn from those that do not , we have also created two _ matched _ parent samples : a `` mass - matched parent sample '' and an `` i - band - apparent - magnitude - matched parent sample '' . in both cases we matched each agn with 3 non - agn chosen from the whole irac sample .",
    "for the mass - matched sample we considered the @xmath22 plane and for each agn with a given redshift and host galaxy stellar mass ( see section  [ sec : masses ] below ) we extracted the 3 non - agn objects from the parent sample which lie closest in the ( @xmath23 ) plane to the agn allowing as maximum difference a factor of 10 in mass .",
    "the same procedure was followed to build the i - band matched sample , this time working on the @xmath24 plane , allowing as maximum difference a factor of 4 in luminosity .",
    "the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) is a multi- wavelength observational project over 1.4@xmath251.4 deg@xmath26 of equatorial field centered at ( ra , dec)@xmath27 = ( 150.1083 , 2.210 ) @xcite .",
    "the cosmos field is characterized by an unprecedented deep multi - wavelength coverage , and in order to compile the sed for the agn sample described above , we exploited such a large number of multi - wavelength data available in the field . for most of the sources",
    "we have constrained the sed using 14 different bands that encompass optical to mir wavelengths . more specifically , for all our sources we used 6 subaru bands ( b , v , g , r , i , z ; from @xcite ) , and the cfht/ u- , j- and k - bands @xcite .",
    "all but a few ( @xmath097% ) of our sources are detected in all 4 spitzer / irac bands ( 3.6@xmath28 m , 4.5@xmath28 m , 5.8@xmath28 m and 8.0@xmath28 m ; @xcite ) and @xmath080% of them are also detected in the 24@xmath28 m spitzer / mips band @xcite . for most of the sources we can thus constrain the sed in a very large wavelength interval , ranging from @xmath03800 (u@xmath29 ) to 24@xmath28 m ( spitzer / mips ) .",
    "moreover , for a few percent of the sample we can also rely on longer wavelength detections .",
    "in particular , for the x - ray selected sample , 109 sources have detection at 70 @xmath28 m ( spitzer / mips , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 216 are visible at 100@xmath28 m and 201 at 160@xmath28 m ( 77 of them are detected in both wavelengths ) by the _",
    "space observatory as part of the pacs evolutionary probe ( pep ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) guaranteed time key program .",
    "in this section , we describe the main tool in our analysis , namely the study of the overall spectral energy distribution of the entire agn sample .",
    "the approach we follow is to consider , with as little _ a priori _ assumptions as possible , each and every observed sed in the sample as the result of the superposition of the nuclear agn emission and of the galactic stellar light entering the fixed apertures of 3 ",
    "diameter used to derive all optical / ir photometry @xcite .",
    "the typical sed of a pure qso , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_ex ] , is characterized by two bumps in the uv and ir regimes @xcite which create a dip at around 1@xmath28 m .",
    "the uv bump is interpreted as thermal emission from the accretion disk @xcite , while the ir bump is thought to be due to absorption of intrinsic agn uv , x - ray and optical radiation by dusty clouds in the agn ` torus ' on @xmath0pc - scales , which subsequently re - radiate this energy at ir frequencies @xcite . despite the apparent large scatter in the observed sed of large qso / agn samples @xcite",
    ", there appear to be little evidence for substantial systematic changes in the _ shape _ of such intrinsic sed ( apart from those introduced by dust extinction ) across wide luminosity ranges , as recently demonstrated by the analysis of broad h@xmath30 line selected local agn from the sdss ( dr7 ) survey @xcite .    on the other hand , the optical sed of a galaxy ( see e.g. left panel of fig . [",
    "fig : temp_ex ] ) is usually modeled as due to the integrated light of the stellar populations of the galaxy which are generated by different star - formation histories .",
    "galaxy seds peak typically at around 1@xmath28 m for a very wide range of sfr histories . in most agn ( with the exception of the most luminous ones )",
    "both components significantly contribute and the global sed is the result of the combination of the central qso s and the host galaxy s sed @xcite .",
    "how much these two components contribute to the global sed in detail depends on a number of factors , the most important ones being their relative luminosity and the level of obscuration affecting each of them .",
    "fixing the redshift of the source to the spectroscopic or photometric redshift , we fit the observed fluxes @xmath31 with a two - component model using a combination of agn and host - galaxy templates ( see e.g. similar approaches * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) ( but see appendix [ sec:1component ] for a comparison with the standard sed fitting method without the agn component ) . this fitting technique , initially presented in @xcite , has been already successfully used in the analysis of smaller agn sub - samples in the cosmos field ( i.e. * ? ? ?",

    "the measure of the host galaxy sfr is subject to considerably larger uncertainties than that of stellar mass , in particular for type1 agn . in general ,",

    "the main problem with type1 ( unobscured ) agn is that the accretion disk emission strongly contributes in the uv band ( see upper panels of fig .",

    "one clear advantage of adopting the rest - frame mir luminosity , l@xmath88 , as a universal agn power estimator for our sample is that , contrary to the [ 2 - 10 ] kev luminosity , this quantity was measured homogeneously for all the sources , including the objects with no x - ray emission .",

    "this is an important test , as galaxies with red colors can be either dusty star - forming galaxies or galaxies with old stellar populations , and any interpretation of the location of agn hosts in the cmd may be strongly affected by the treatment of dust extinction in these systems ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "very blue colors of bright type1 agn ( see , in particular , the clusters of sources at u - b@xmath1020.1 - 0.3 in all extinction corrected cmd ) should not be too trustworthy , as they most likely indicate objects for which the sed decomposition , and thus the agn blue light subtraction , may give uncertain and possibly unreliable results .",

    "as a matter of fact , the relative fraction of type1 and type2 agn changes only slightly with b - band luminosity in each redshift interval , but the overall fractions of obscured and unobscured agn are markedly different in the three redshift bins .",

    "more importantly , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : ub_mb ] that dust extinction correction affects more severely the overall color distribution of the parent galaxy sample .",
    "this can be seen in the fact that the agn fraction in the b - band most luminous galaxies in the sample decreases once dust correction is included .",
    "indeed , at any redshift , agn hosts are found mainly in red galaxies , albeit with a substantial tail towards intermediate and bluer colors ( see also fig . [",

    "agn were described as populating preferentially an intermediate region , the so called `` green valley '' @xcite , with the possible interpretation that they live in quenched galaxies going through the transition phase between active and passive star - formation phase .",
    "however , most of these works were focused on small subsample of the agn population and , more important , the agn component was not subtracted in the computation of the host colors leading to a possible blue contamination from the agn which in fact would push red hosts into the green valley . moreover , the net effect of the dust correction applied systematically , and in a uniform way , to both the parent and the agn host galaxy samples is to _ decrease _ the fraction of agn in the most star - forming objects .        in general , the often contrasting interpretations of many previous studies of the cmd of agn hosts from deep multi - wavelength surveys",
    "@xcite demonstrates that studying their position within optical color - magnitude diagrams is hardly a robust way to unveil the star - forming nature of agn hosts .",

    "figure [ fig : ub_m ] shows the position of our agn sources in the color - mass diagram , where the colors ( u - v ) are corrected for extinction .",
    "black contours show the whole galaxy sample drawn from @xcite while grey points correspond to the i - band - apparent - magnitude - matched parent sample described in sec .",
    "[ sec : parent ] . comparing with the whole galaxy population",
    ", we find that , at any redshift , agn are preferentially detected in massive galaxies , in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the trend is still present if we use as comparison sample the i - band - matched sample . in the next section",
    "we will investigate in greater detail the evolution of the agn fraction as a function of redshift , x - ray luminosity , stellar mass of the host , and of the ratio of these two latter quantities .",
    "here we note , however , that except for few unobscured agn in the intermediate z bin showing extreme ( and probably unreliable ) blue colors , obscured and unobscured agn overlap very well in the color - mass plane .",
    "since massive hosts tend to be redder , the trend with mass and the one with colors seen in the previous section should go in parallel .",
    "in many previous studies it has been pointed out how , removing the mass dependency i.e. using a mass - matched control sample , the trend with color disappears @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the case in our study .",
    "fig [ fig : ub_histo ] shows the extinction corrected u@xmath100b color histogram for agn hosts in the usual three redshift bins , for three different ranges of stellar masses , all above the completeness threshold of the ilbert et al .",
    "( 2010 ) parent galaxy sample , divided into unobscured ( shaded blue ) and obscured ( shaded red ) agn and compared to the mass - matched galaxy sample .",
    "galaxies hosting an agn tend to be redder than normal galaxies of comparable stellar mass ( the median color shift ranges between @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "following our discussion in the previous section , we can speculate about two main reasons for the discrepancy between our color distributions of agn hosts in mass - matched samples and previous studies .",
    "first of all , our sed decomposition technique allow a more reliable correction for agn light `` pollution '' that would typically move the color of an agn host towards the blue , star - forming sequence .",
    "second , thanks to the unique multi - wavelength coverage of the cosmos field , we are able to extinction - correct , in a systematic way , all galaxy colors , both in the parent and in the agn host samples . we find that moving dusty star - forming galaxies back to the blue cloud with such a correction effectively decreases the incidence of agn among star - forming galaxy , while , conversely , the relative fraction of agn hosts in truly passive galaxies is enhanced .",
    "we caution however that , being these color shifts relatively small , systematic effects due to a non - optimal agn - galaxy decomposition ( agn over - subtraction , see section  [ sec : results_sed_fit ] ) or to the specific choice of stellar population templates , could still be held responsible for some of this observed trend .",
    "let us now move to a quantitative assessment of the fraction of agn as a function of host stellar mass . in order to do so , we need to take carefully into account the selection function of our survey .",
    "for this reason , in this section , we will consider only the x - ray selected agn , taking advantage from the well defined exposure map of the xmm - cosmos survey @xcite .",
    "so far , one of the clearest pieces of evidence emerging from a variety of comparative studies of agn and host galaxies in large multi - wavelength surveys is the fact that the likelihood of finding an agn is a very strong function of the galaxy stellar mass , with agn fractions ( or , equivalently , duty cycles ) increasing with increasing host galaxy stellar mass .",
    "this is a particularly strong effect for radio - selected agn @xcite , but has been confirmed also for x - ray selected agn @xcite .",
    "first of all , we compute the probability to find an agn within a logarithmic bin of a given x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev , absorption corrected ) luminosity , @xmath107 , in different bins of stellar mass by taking the ratio of the number of agn with measured host s stellar mass in that range divided by the number of galaxies ( of all morphological , color and star - formation activity types ) having stellar mass in the same range in the parent sample of @xcite : @xmath108    in practice , the sensitivity limits of the xmm - newton observations vary spatially across the field ( see fig",
    ". 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hence to derive the fraction of galaxies hosting an agn as a function of the stellar mass , we followed the technique discussed in sec .",
    "3.1 of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath109 for each stellar mass and luminosity bin is determined by the following equation :        @xmath113 is the number of galaxies that could have been detected as x - ray sources at their position ( given the known exposure map of the xmm - cosmos survey ) if they had the luminosity @xmath114 of the @xmath115th agn in the given bin .",
    "figure [ fig : agnfrac_m_lbin ] shows the probability of galaxies hosting agn , @xmath116 , for different stellar mass bins in three redshift intervals . for lower mass points , completeness has been treated conservatively , i.e. we have assumed that the parent galaxy sample is complete only above the mass completeness limit for quiescent galaxies as function of redshift , as reported in @xcite ( this translates into mass limits completeness of about @xmath117 for the three redshift bins , respectively ) . in those cases ,",
    "our agn fractions are considered as upper limits .",
    "the good statistics of our large , homogeneous and complete sample , allows for an accurate study of agn incidence , which accounts for both redshift and intrinsic agn luminosity dependence ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in each panel , agn with different intrinsic x - ray luminosity are plotted with different colors . while the global trend with masses remains qualitatively the same in each luminosity bin",
    ", the normalization strongly decreases with luminosity , i.e. for a galaxy of a given mass the probability to host an agn is higher as the agn x - ray luminosity decreases and the same happens at any redshift .",
    "this is an obvious consequence of the shape of the agn luminosity function : more luminous agn are rare , while less luminous ones are much more common .",
    "very interestingly , as already shown by @xcite , the @xmath109 as a function of galaxy stellar mass do show very similar profiles at _ all _ sampled luminosities .",
    "agn , of any intrinsic luminosity , are more common the more massive the host galaxy is .",
    "this is by no means a trivial fact : one could have easily expected that more luminous agn were to be found in more massive galaxies and less luminous agn in lower mass galaxies .",
    "this , in fact , is the prediction of any model in which black hole growth in agn phases occurs over relatively narrow eddington ratio ranges , and the very different picture we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : agnfrac_m_lbin ] ( as well as in fig .",
    "[ fig : agnfrac_m_eddbin ] , see below ) is a strong indication that agn of all masses should be characterized by a very broad distribution of eddington ratios ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we quantify this statement by studying the agn fractions as a function of the specific accretion rate in section  [ sec : agn_frac_ledd ] below .",
    "figure  [ fig : agnfrac_m_lbin ] also shows ( black points ) the total agn fraction above a given luminosity thresholds in each redshift interval ( i.e. computed by summing up the @xmath109 in different luminosity bins ) . as a comparison , the thin dot - dashed line is the prediction for the total agn fraction , computed in the same redshift bins and above the same luminosity thresholds , from the `` agn occupation '' model of @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to that work for more details , but we note here that in @xcite the agn fraction is computed by deriving an active smbh mass function from the observed agn luminosity function , assuming a given shape for the eddington ratio distribution , and then comparing it to the observed galaxy mass function .",
    "in the two highest redshift bins , such a model reproduces our data remarkably well .",
    "however , severe discrepancies appear in our lowest redshift range . as we will show in the next section",
    ", it appears that the true eddington ratio distribution of our agn is better described by a simple power - law and the fact that the shape assumed in @xcite is a log - normal can explain the discrepancy .",
    "in fact , while in the highest redshift bins , where our cosmos agn sample probes just a limited range of eddington ratios , the observed distribution is hardly distinguishable from a log - normal distribution with appropriate parameters , in the lowest redshift range , the log - normal shape assumed by @xcite under - predicts the number of low luminosity agn hosted in massive galaxies ( @xmath118 ) . assuming a log - normal distribution with a peak at lower eddington ratio",
    "would already improve the prediction in the first redshift bin as shown by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : agnfrac_m_lbin ] which corresponds to a distribution with @xmath119=0.03 .",
    "indeed , by combining the available information ( host galaxy stellar mass and agn luminosity ) we can study the probability of a galaxy to host an agn as a function of mass in bins of `` specific accretion rate '' , i.e. , the ratio l@xmath120/m@xmath121 which gives an approximate estimate of the rate at which the smbh grows . to the extent that a proportionality between the black hole mass and the ( total ) host galaxy stellar mass can be assumed ( and this is far from being clear ,",
    "see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this ratio could give a rough measure of the black hole eddington ratio , defined as the ratio between the agn x - ray luminosity and the eddington luminosity . to be specific",
    ", the eddington ratio can be expressed as : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the 2 - 10 kev bolometric correction , and the factor @xmath124 is a constant if the smbh mass can be related to the host galaxy mass through scaling relations ( with @xmath125 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". thus , for a mean bolometric correction of @xmath126 and a constant host stellar to black hole mass ratio of @xmath127 , a ratio of l@xmath120/m@xmath128 would approximately correspond to the eddington limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : agnfrac_m_eddbin ] shows how the probability @xmath129 of a galaxy to host an agn of a given specific accretion rate scales with the stellar mass of the host . here",
    ", of course , the issue of completeness is far more complicated .",
    "depending on the @xmath6 ratio interval considered , both the flux limit of the x - ray survey and the stellar mass completeness limit of the parent galaxy sample should all be taken into account .",
    "figure  [ fig : agnfrac_m_eddbin ] shows that , at any given specific accretion rate ( a proxy , with all the caveats discussed above , of the eddington ratio ) , the trend with mass almost disappears : the probability for a galaxy to host an agn of a given @xmath130 is almost _ independent _ of its mass but scales only with the ratio itself .    in figure  [ fig : fagn_eddbin ] , we then plot @xmath129 as a function of the specific accretion rate itself . as mentioned above , there is little dispersion among the points corresponding to different mass bins for the same @xmath131 interval .",
    "we can _ assume _ that the agn fraction at any given value of the @xmath6 ratio is independent of host galaxy mass , and measure such a constant `` universal '' mean probability for every specific accretion rate and redshift bin .",
    "the thick black triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fagn_eddbin ] show the mean values of @xmath132 .",
    "indeed , all the data seem consistent with the idea that , at every redshift , there is a _ universal _",
    "distribution function that describes the probability of a galaxy of any mass ( above our completeness limit of @xmath133 ) to host an agn of a given specific accretion rate @xmath131 , independent of host stellar mass @xcite .",
    "as we have anticipated , to the first order , the data are consistent with a power - law like distribution and a clear break at values of @xmath6 consistent with the eddington limit . in table",
    "[ tab : frac_edd_slopes ] we report the values of the best fit power - law distribution for each of the three redshift bins , in the form : @xmath134    as compared to the values found in @xcite , we find a somewhat steeper slope for the power - law index ( @xmath1351 rather than @xmath1350.7 ) .",
    "we speculate that this might have to do with the fact that , differently from @xcite , we do not include agn from the deepest _ chandra _ fields , that probe the fainter , shallower end of the x - ray luminosity function .",
    "hint of such a flattening can be seen in the decline of the @xmath116 for the most massive galaxies at low x - ray luminosities in fig  [ fig : agnfrac_m_lbin ] .",
    "these are very low specific accretion rate objects for which we are not complete in the cosmos sample ( they are shown as lower limits in figures  [ fig : agnfrac_m_eddbin ] and  [ fig : fagn_eddbin ] ) and therefore can not properly assess the robustness of any change in slope at low @xmath131 .",
    "the possibility that the @xmath136 might break to a shallower slope at low values of the specific accretion rate could be tested , indirectly , by comparing the observed x - ray luminosity function of the agn with a convolution of the observed galaxy mass function and the probability distribution @xmath137 .",
