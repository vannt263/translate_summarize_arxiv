    "in this paper we study the dynamics of two different incompressible fluids with the same viscosity in a bounded porous medium .",
    "this is known as the confined muskat problem . for this problem",
    "we show that there are global in time lipschitz continuous solutions corresponding to initial data that fulfills some conditions related to the amplitude , slope and depth .",
    "this problem is of practical importance because it is used as a model for a geothermal reservoir ( see @xcite and references therein ) or a model of an aquifer or an oil well ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity of a fluid flowing in a porous medium satisfies darcy s law ( see @xcite ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath2 is the permeability of the medium , @xmath3 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath4 is the density of the fluid , @xmath5 is the pressure of the fluid and @xmath6 is the incompressible velocity field . to simplify the notation we assume @xmath7 the motion of a fluid in a two - dimensional porous medium is analogous to the hele - shaw cell problem ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "let us consider the spatial domain @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "we assume impermeable boundary conditions for the velocity in the walls . in this domain",
    "we have two immiscible and incompressible fluids with the same viscosity and different densities ; @xmath10 fills the upper subdomain and @xmath11 fills the lower subdomain ( see figure [ ivscheme ] ) .",
    "the graph @xmath12 is the interface between the fluids .",
    "it is well - known that the system is in the ( rayleigh - taylor ) stable regime if the denser fluid is below the lighter one in every point @xmath13 , _ i.e. _ @xmath14 .",
    "conversely , the system is in the unstable regime if there is at least a point @xmath13 where the denser fluid is above the lighter one .",
    "if the fluids fill the whole plane the contour equation satisfies ( see @xcite ) @xmath15 for this equation the authors show the existence of classical solution locally in time ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) in the rayleigh - taylor stable regime , and maximum principles for @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the authors show the existence of turning waves and finite time singularities . in @xcite",
    "the authors show an energy balance for the @xmath18 norm and some results concerning the global existence of solutions corresponding to _ small _ initial data .",
    "furthermore , they show that if initially @xmath19 , then there is global lipschitz solution and if the initial data has small @xmath20 norm then there is global classical solution .    the case where the fluid domain is the strip @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , has been studied in @xcite . in this domain",
    "the equation for the interface is @xmath21    for equation the authors in @xcite obtain local existence of classical solution when the system starts its evolution in the stable regime and the initial interface does not reach the walls , and the existence of initial data such that @xmath22 blows up in finite time .",
    "the authors also study the effect of the boundaries on the evolution of the interface , obtaining the maximum principle and a decay estimate for @xmath16 and the maximum principle for @xmath17 for initial data satisfying the following hypotheses : @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 these hypotheses are smallness conditions relating @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the depth .",
    "we define @xmath28 as the solution of the system @xmath29 then , for initial data satisfying @xmath30 the authors in @xcite show that @xmath31 these inequalities define a region where the slope of the solution can grow but it is bounded uniformly in time .",
    "this region only appears in the finite depth case .    in this paper",
    "the question of global existence of weak solution ( in the sense of definition [ ivdefi ] ) for in the stable regime is adressed .",
    "in particular we show the following theorem :    [ ivglobal ] let @xmath32 be the initial datum satisfying hypotheses , and or in the rayleigh - taylor stable regime .",
    "then there exists a global solution @xmath33 moreover , if the initial data satisfy , and the solution fulfills the following bounds : @xmath34 while , if the initial datums satisfy , the solution satisfies the following bounds : @xmath35    this result excludes the formation of cusps ( blow up of the first and second derivatives ) and turning waves for these initial data , remaining open the existence ( or non - existence ) of corners ( blow up of the curvature with finite first derivative ) during the evolution .",
    "notice that in the limit @xmath36 we recover the result contained in @xcite .",
    "in this paper and the works @xcite the effect of the boundaries over the evolution of the internal wave in a flow in porous media has been addressed . when these results for the confined case are compared with the known results in the case where the depth is infinite ( see @xcite ) three main differences",
    "appear :    1 .",
    "the decay of the maximum amplitude is slower in the confined case .",
    "2 .   there are smooth curves with finite energy that turn over in the confined case but do not show this behaviour when the fluids fill the whole plane .",
    "3 .   to avoid the turning effect in the confined case you need to have smallness conditions in @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , in the unconfined case , only the condition in the slope is required . moreover , in the confined case a new region without turning effect appears : a region without a maximum principle for the slope but with an uniform bound . in both cases (",
    "the region with the maximum principle and the region with the uniform bound ) , theorem [ ivglobal ] ensures the existence of a global lipschitz continuous solution .    keeping these results in mind , there are some questions that remain open . for instance",
    ", the existence of a wave whose maximum slope grows but remains uniformly bounded , or the existence of a wave with small slope such that , due to the distance to the boundaries , its slope grows and the existence ( or non - existence ) of corner - like singularities when the initial data considered is small in @xmath37 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ ivglobal ] is achieved using some lemmas and propositions .",
    "first , we define _",
    "hoc _ diffusive operators and the regularized system ( see section [ ivsec1 ] ) . for this regularized system , we show some _ a priori _ bounds for the amplitude and the slope . with these _",
    "a priori _ bounds we show global existence of @xmath20 solution ( see section [ ivsecglobal ] ) .",
    "then , we obtain the weak solution to , @xmath38 , as the limit of the regularized solutions ( see sections [ ivsec4 ] and [ ivsec5 ] ) .    on the rest of the paper",
    "we take @xmath39 and @xmath40 and we drop in the notation the @xmath41 dependence .",
    "we write @xmath42 for a universal constant that can change from one line to another . we denote @xmath43.$ ]",
    "in this section we define the regularized system and obtain some useful _ a priori _ bounds for the amplitude and the slope . to clarify the exposition we write @xmath44 for the solution of the regularized system .",
    "we remark that the term @xmath45 in is a singular integral operator , while @xmath46 is not if the curve does not reach the boundaries . in order to remove the singularity while preserving the inner structure , we put a term @xmath47 for @xmath48 in both kernels .",
    "we define @xmath49 and @xmath50 to pass to the limit we use compactness coming from an uniform bound in@xmath51,w^{1,\\infty}({\\mathbb r}))$ ] .",
    "thus , we need to obtain _",
    "priori _ bounds for the amplitude and the slope .",
    "we define @xmath52 @xmath53 positive constants that will be fixed below depending only on the initial datum considered . taking derivatives in @xmath54",
    ", we obtain some terms with positive contribution .",
    "so , we attach some diffusive operators to the regularized system . given a smooth function @xmath55 , we define @xmath56 we notice that , if the depth is not @xmath57 , the previous operators should be rescaled and we write the subscript @xmath58 to keep this dependence in mind .",
    "these operators are finite depth versions of the classical @xmath59 . roughly speaking , there are three different types of _ extra _ terms appearing in the derivatives of and that we need to control to obtain the _ a priori _ bound for the slope :    1",
    ".   there are terms which have an integrable singularity and they appear multiplied by @xmath60 . in order to handle these terms",
    "we add @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "these two scales @xmath63 , @xmath64 , appear naturally due to the nonlinearity present in .",
    "there are terms which are nonlinear versions of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "these terms go to zero due to the convergence of the operators but they are not multiplied by @xmath60 . in order to handle these terms we add @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "3 .   to absorb the nonsingular terms we add @xmath69 . we notice that , as @xmath70 , the square root converges to zero less than linearly .",
    "this factor will be used because the contribution of some terms is @xmath71 with @xmath72 .    once the _",
    "a priori _ bounds are achieved , we should prove global solvability in @xmath20 for the regularized system . to get this bound",
    "we add @xmath73 .",
    "we also regularize the initial datum . we take @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , a symmetric mollifier and define @xmath77 .",
    "given @xmath78 we define the initial datum for the regularized system as @xmath79 putting all together , we define the regularized system @xmath80 where @xmath81 are universal constants that will be fixed below depending only on the initial datum @xmath82 .",
    "we remark that @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .",
    "notice that , due to the continuity of @xmath82 , @xmath85 uniformly on any compact set in @xmath86 . since @xmath87 , we get @xmath88 and then , as as @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 a.e . thus , we have @xmath91 and @xmath92 . furthermore , we have that if @xmath82 satisfies the hypotheses , and , @xmath93 also satisfy these hypotheses if @xmath60 is small enough .",
    "moreover , if @xmath94 satisfy the same remains valid for @xmath95 and @xmath96 if @xmath60 is small enough .",
    "we use some properties of the operators @xmath97 .",
    "for the reader s convenience , we collect them in the following lemma :    [ ivops ] for the operators @xmath97 ( see ) , the following properties hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath97 is @xmath18-symmetric .",

    "then , they converge acting on @xmath55 as @xmath60 goes to zero : @xmath98 4 .",
    "let @xmath55 be a schwartz function .",
    "then , the derivative can be written in two different forms as @xmath99    the proof of the first two statement follows from .",
    "for the proof of the third part we recall some useful facts : if @xmath100 , due to the mean value theorem , we get @xmath101 and @xmath102 now the proof follows in a straightforward way . for the last statement we use the cancellation coming from the principal value to define @xmath103 using the uniform convergence of the derivative , we conclude the result .      in this section",
