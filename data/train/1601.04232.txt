    "the construction of quantum gravity is one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical physics .",

    "the classical notion , namely the continuous entity of spacetime with geometries , should appear as an infrared effective description of the new picture .",
    "the main subject of this paper is to explicitly show that the classical notion of spaces with geometries appears as an emergent phenomenon from the dynamics of the randomly connected tensor network . here",
    ", the randomly connected tensor network is defined as random summation of tensor networks : tensors are treated as controllable external variables , while connections of tensors are randomly summed over .",
    "we will show that spaces with geometries appear on boundaries of randomly connected tensor networks , if tensors are appropriately chosen . by varying the tensors",
    ", one can freely choose the dimensions of the spaces , and can also vary the geometries .",
    "we will explicitly give the correspondence from the tensors to the geometries for general curved cases .    the background motivation for this work comes from the fact that the randomly connected tensor network is tightly related to a tensor model in the hamilton formalism .",

    "though the original tensor models suffer from some difficulties , the coloured tensor models @xcite , which appeared later with improvements , have extensively been analyzed @xcite .",
    "however , the analyses so far have shown that the dominant configurations do not generate realistic structures comparable to our actual spacetime : branched polymers , for example , dominate @xcite in the simplest settings .",
    "on the other hand , the numerical analyses of @xmath0 simplicial quantum gravity have shown that the lorentzian models called causal dynamical triangulations ( cdt ) successfully generate de - sitter like spacetimes like our actual universe @xcite , while the euclidean ones do not .- fields , the authors in @xcite found a promise of a phase transition higher than first order , which , however , is in conflict with the result in @xcite . ]",
    "this success of cdt motivated one of the present authors to formulate a tensor model in the hamilton formalism @xcite , which we call canonical tensor model ( ctm ) .",
    "ctm has been shown to have various interesting properties .",
    "it is unique under reasonable assumptions @xcite , and has tight connections with general relativity @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has connections to the randomly connected tensor network @xcite : the hamiltonian of ctm generates a sort of a renormalization group flow of the randomly connected tensor network @xcite .",
    "the randomly connected tensor network is also useful in constructing the exact physical states of the quantized version of ctm @xcite .",
    "so far , a number of network - based models for emergent space or spacetime have been proposed , _",
    "e.g. _ spin networks @xcite , loop quantum gravity ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , causal sets @xcite , energetic causal sets @xcite , quantum graphity @xcite , information - bits model by trugenberger @xcite , wolfram s evolving networks @xcite , dariano - tosini causal networks @xcite , structurally dynamic cellular networks ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , lumpy networks ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , complex quantum network manifold @xcite and network geometry with flavor @xcite . all the above constructions",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : rctn ] , we define the randomly connected tensor network , and explain our method to analyze it , which has been developed in @xcite . in section  [ sec : space ] , we explain some difficulties in regarding the randomly connected tensor network itself as a space , and argue that its boundary is more qualified . in section  [ sec : flat ] , we explicitly give such tensors that generate flat spaces of arbitrary dimensions on the boundaries of the randomly connected tensor networks . in section  [ sec : general ] , we consider variation of the tensors from those of the flat spaces to generate curved spaces .",
    "we explicitly give the correspondence from the tensors to the geometries of the spaces .",
    "in section  [ sec : phasetransition ] , we study phase transitions in which the flat spaces break down to point - like spaces and others .",

    "[ sec : covariance ] , we describe a covariant structure under the spatial diffeomorphism in the continuum description of the randomly connected tensor network , which is used in section  [ sec : general ] .",
    "we consider a real symmetric rank - three tensor , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 . as a tensor product of @xmath2 s",
    "we introduce the following rank-@xmath4 tensor : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is even integer . contracting all indices in ( [ eq : w ] ) in pairs by @xmath7 delta functions @xmath8 , we construct o(@xmath9)-invariant quantities .",
    "we denote such o(@xmath9)-invariant quantities by @xmath10 where @xmath11 specifies one way of contracting all indices in pairs .",
    "in fact , one can consider @xmath11 as a regular network consisting of @xmath6 three - vertices .",
    "namely , we introduce @xmath6 trivalent vertices and assign @xmath2 to each vertex in such a way that three lines emerging from a single trivalent vertex carry the indices , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , and connect them by lines if the indices are contracted . in this way",
    ", one can construct a regular network @xmath11 allowing self - contractions .",
    "the self - contraction means that two of the three lines originating from a single vertex are connected by a line .",
    "see fig.[fig : networkp ] for an example of the networks .    .",
    "[ fig : networkp],width=113 ]    by this understanding , we define the partition function as a sum over all networks @xmath11 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the order of the automorphism group of @xmath11 .",
    "we call the model defined by the partition function ( [ eq : znp01 ] ) _ randomly connected tensor networks _ , and the randomness comes from the sum over all networks with the tensor assigned to each vertex .",
    "in fact one can choose @xmath2 so that the partition function ( [ eq : znp01 ] ) describes a statistical system on random networks @xcite , such as the ising model on random networks .    for convenience , we rewrite the partition function ( [ eq : znp01 ] ) in terms of the real integral @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are real integration variables , and",
    "we have used the shorthand notations given by @xmath19 here , repeated indices above are assumed to be summed over , and hereafter we will use this convention for the sum . applying wick s theorem , one can confirm that the partition functions , ( [ eq : znp01 ] ) and ( [ eq : zofrctn ] ) , coincide .",
    "the partition function is invariant under the o(@xmath9 ) transformation of @xmath20 , @xmath21    let us consider the thermodynamic limit of the randomly connected tensor network , in which the size of the networks grows to infinity , @xmath22 .",

    "the minimum @xmath32 is one of the solutions @xmath33 to the stationary condition , @xmath34 where we have used the following shorthand notation : @xmath35 multiplying by @xmath36 , one obtains @xmath37 in simplifying expressions , is useful in the form , @xmath38 note that @xmath36 and @xmath39 are generally dependent on @xmath20 , but we suppress the argument for notational simplicity .    in general , in the vicinities of first order phase transition surfaces , not only the absolute minimum of the free energy but also stable local minima are physically relevant",
    ". the local stability of each stationary point can be checked by evaluating the positivity of the hessian , _",

    "it is not an easy question how random networks can be regarded as spaces .",
    "the most naive manner of identification would be to regard vertices as points forming a space and connecting lines as representations of local structures of their neighbourhoods .",
    "in fact , this is the common perspective used in lattice theories .",
    "however , this lattice - like way of viewing random networks as spaces seems to have at least the following difficulties :    * _ difference of structures between random networks and our space _ : random networks do not seem to have similar structures as our actual space , which is smooth , respects locality , and has three dimensions .",
    "in fact , it is known that , in the thermodynamic limit , random networks with a fixed degree of vertices effectively approach the bethe lattice , which is tree - like @xcite . this is far from the actual structure of our space . * _ finite correlation lengths _ : the ising model on random networks with a finite degree of vertices has a finite correlation length even on the second order phase transition point in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . since this seems to be an outcome of the tree - like structure of the bethe lattice in the thermodynamic limit , finiteness of correlation lengths will generally hold in the other statistical systems on random networks .",
    "this means that it is not possible to get any modes which propagate infinitely far .",
    "therefore , it is not plausible to obtain physically sensible theories for the actual space from such a framework . *",
    "_ difficulty in labeling positions in random networks _ : in our framework , each vertex is just a representation of a tensor @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the vertices are basically all the same and can not be distinguished from each other in a well - defined way in the random sum over networks .",
    "this difficulty in labelling the vertices would be an obstacle in obtaining any classical geometries .    in view of these difficulties ,",
    "the naive picture to identify randomly connected tensor networks as spaces may not be a right way .",
    "especially , the last difficulty above suggests that we should more seriously consider what are the appropriate quantities to observe in randomly connected tensor networks .",
    "the natural physically relevant quantities of the system defined by the partition function are the correlation functions of @xmath45 : @xmath46 applying wick s theorem as before , the correlation function above corresponds to the summation over tensor networks with external lines having fixed indices ( see fig.[fig : external ] ) . in other words",
    ", this is the random summation over tensor networks with fixed configurations on their boundaries .",
    "so , we are pursuing the possibility of regarding boundaries of random networks as spaces rather than networks themselves , or , in other words , the possibility that  points \" labelled by the index set on the boundaries form a space .",
    "note that , due to the random summation over networks , the local structure of neighborhoods on such boundaries may be significantly different from that of networks themselves .",
    "this difference may solve the geometrical difficulties mentioned in the first and second items of the list above . in the rest of this paper",

    "here we have also used that , from , the one point function is sub - dominant , @xmath55 higher order correlation functions behave similarly as a free theory in the leading order .    thus , the challenge is whether we can find appropriate @xmath20 s so that the correlation function behaves in the same manner as that in a regular space .",
    "this task contains the dynamical complexity that the minimum solution @xmath36 depends non - trivially on @xmath20 . in section",
    "[ sec : flat ] , we will give exactly solvable cases representing flat @xmath56-dimensional tori , and , in section  [ sec : general ] , we will treat spaces with general metrics .",
    "the dynamical complexity concerning the stability of the spaces will be discussed in section  [ sec : phasetransition ] .",
    "in this section , we explicitly give @xmath20 s which realize arbitrary dimensional flat spaces .",
    "the criterion for the emergence is whether the correlation function is similar to that in a flat space .",
    "this is equivalent to showing that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath54 are similar to those in a flat space .",
    "we will first discuss the one - dimensional case , circles , and then consider @xmath56-dimensional flat tori .",
    "we parametrize @xmath2 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a real parameter , and @xmath59 is a local part of the tensor .",
    "the components of the local part are given by @xmath60 here we use latin @xmath61 on indices for components of a tensor , and the repetition of them does not imply summing over .",

    "because of the discrete translational symmetry in @xmath20 , a solution to the stationary condition is given by @xmath71 this solution is stable as a local minimum , when the spectra being obtained below are all positive . on the other hand , whether this is an absolute minimum or not is a complex problem , and will be studied in section  [ sec : phasetransition ] .    for the solution , it is not hard to calculate that @xmath72 where @xmath73 . for the convenience of our future discussion ,",
    "we introduce two symbols .",

    "we find that they are the eigenvectors of @xmath54 : @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus , naming @xmath85 the spectra of @xmath86 are represented by the set @xmath87 .",
    "an example of the spectra is plotted in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .    .",
    "]    as can be seen in the example , the spectra of @xmath54 are similar to those of @xmath88 in one dimension , except that the zero mode is supermassive and that higher spectra are deformed .",
    "thus , the minimal of these spectra should be regarded as the rest mass , and an analogue of @xmath89 on the emergent space can be evaluated by subtracting the mass from these spectra .",
    "then , one way to understand the geometric property in general is to compute the spectral dimension defined by @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 . for different @xmath93 and @xmath94",

    "the strategy is that we will compute the quadratic term of @xmath51 in to extract a metric in an effective field theory in a formal continuum limit .",
    "to set aside a super - massive mode similar to the zero mode for the flat case in section  [ sec : flat ] , we assume perturbations @xmath51 around the vacuum @xmath36 to satisfy a constraint , @xmath170 this is a non - local kind of constraint , since , in the present general case too , we expect that @xmath171 takes non - vanishing values for all the range of @xmath12 .",
    "this non - local constraint would not ruin the significance of our model , since it would be impossible for a local observer to detect the existence of such a single non - local constraint , when @xmath9 is large .",
    "then the contraction of @xmath172 with the hessian is given by @xmath173    when @xmath174 , we implement the formal continuum limit : @xmath175 where the discrete labels @xmath176 have been replaced by the continuous coordinates @xmath177 , respectively .",
    "although @xmath178 is a tri - local function , by definition , @xmath179 unless @xmath180 .",
    "in other words , @xmath178 can be regarded as a distribution concentrated around @xmath180 , and a moment expansion , which was introduced in another context in @xcite , will give a good approximation : @xmath181 where @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 are test functions , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 are the moments , the argument @xmath189 is suppressed in the last line for brevity , and the dots represent higher moments being neglected in the present analysis . due to the symmetry of @xmath178 under the exchange of its arguments @xmath190 , the moments are not independent and satisfy @xcite @xmath191 as has been shown in @xcite , the o(@xmath9 ) invariance of the randomly connected tensor network implies that the formal continuum limit of the system be invariant under the spatial diffeomorphism .",
    "the spatial diffeomorphism is such that , after the formal replacement @xmath192 , a vector , say @xmath193 , becomes a scalar half - density @xmath194 .",
    "therefore the test functions above should be treated as scalar half - densities , and the moments defined above are not covariant . in order to make the transformation property transparent , let us introduce a symmetric two - tensor @xmath195 , which will shortly be related to the moments , and rewrite the expansion ( [ eq : momentexp ] ) as @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the covariant derivative associated with @xmath195 , and @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 are the covariant moments .",

    "the action is valid when the spatial dependence of the variations of the fields are small .",
    "the action has certainly a covariant form , which is an outcome of the underlying o(@xmath9 ) invariance of the system and the consistency of the reparametrization .",
    "lastly , we stress that the metric originates from the  soft \" non - local effects of @xmath221 , characterizing the derivative terms in the action .",
    "in section  [ sec : flat ] , the @xmath20 which realizes the flat space contains a non - local part proportional to @xmath58 . generally speaking ,",
    "such a non - local part would cause troubles by breaking the locality of a system , and would make the system unrealistic . in the present case , however , the spectra of the perturbations around the background agree with those of a usual scalar field theory in a flat space , except for the zero mode .",
    "this single anomalous behaviour of the zero mode will be ignorable for a local observer in the large @xmath9 limit , and therefore our model can be considered realistic .",
    "in fact , the non - local part of @xmath20 is indispensable for the stability of the flat space : as can be checked easily in , if @xmath222 , the hessian matrix contains negative eigenvalues , and the flat space is not a stable local minimum .",
    "thus , if we start from a locally stable flat space with a sufficiently large @xmath223 , and reduce it continuously , the flat space will eventually become unstable and decay into a new configuration .",
    "this is a breakdown of the flat space .",
    "if this picture of the transition being triggered by appearance of negative eigenvalues is right , this process will be a second order phase transition . however , this is not always true .",
    "in fact , in a certain parameter region of @xmath224 , there exists a distinct stable configuration which has a free energy lower than that of the flat space . in this region ,",
    "the flat space is not a global minimum , and decays to it generally with a first - order phase transition . as we will see",

    "let us first show , by a qualitative estimation , that such a point - like profile of @xmath225 can actually have a free energy lower than that of the flat space .",
    "let us consider the two configurations described by @xmath226 the former describes the flat space in section  [ sec : flat ] , and the latter describes a point - like space , as it has a non - vanishing component only at , say , @xmath227 .",
    "the normalization is taken so that they satisfy .",
    "note that the latter configuration does not have to satisfy the stationary equation , because we are just interested in whether there exists a profile of @xmath225 with a lower free energy than that of the flat space .",
    "because of the normalization @xmath228 , the free energy can be compared by the values of @xmath229 , as can be seen in . by substituting to @xmath230 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath231 when @xmath232 , which is the case of our main interest , @xmath233 for @xmath234 , and hence @xmath235 has a lower free energy .",
    "therefore , the flat space is globally stable only at @xmath236 . on the other hand ,",
    "the second order phase transitions triggered by negative eigenvalues should occur at @xmath237 , because the eigenvalues are functions of @xmath238 as can be seen in .",
    "since the estimated location @xmath239 is outside the globally stable region of the flat space , the transition between the flat and a point - like space is more likely to occur than the second order phase transition .",
    "since the two configurations in are largely different from each other , the phase transition between the flat and the point - like spaces should be first order in general .",
    "the following numerical results support the qualitative discussion above .",
    "in fact , the actual phase structure is more complex than that .",
    "we have considered some fixed values of @xmath240 and have gone through discrete values of @xmath58 with small intervals . for every @xmath58 ,",

    "the second order of the phase transition between ( iii ) and ( iv ) suggests that the transition is triggered by a negative eigenvalue .",

    "in this paper , we have shown that classical spaces with geometries , generally curved , in arbitrary dimensions can be generated on boundaries of randomly connected tensor networks in the thermodynamic limit by appropriately choosing the tensors . in particular , we have seen that such a tensor must contain not only a local part representing structures of local neighbourhoods but also a non - local part which stabilizes the space .",

    "we have given the explicit solvable examples of arbitrary dimensional flat tori .",
    "as for the general case , the correspondence from the tensor to the geometry of the emergent space has been obtained from an analysis of an effective action .",
    "the action has an invariant form under the spatial diffeomorphism , which is an outcome of the underlying orthogonal group symmetry of the randomly connected tensor network .",
    "we have also studied phase transitions among various kinds of spaces including extended and point - like ones .    in the randomly connected tensor network ,",
    "the tensor is a given external variable rather than a dynamical one , and therefore the emergent space is a static object .",
    "this is an unsatisfactory situation from the perspective of quantum gravity and even in classical contexts . on the other hand ,",
    "the tensor is a dynamical variable in the canonical tensor model ( ctm ) , and its hamiltonian generates a flow equation for the tensor of the randomly connected tensor network , which can be regarded as a renormalization group flow @xcite .",
    "then , by using the result of this paper about the correspondence from the tensor to the geometry , the dynamical equation of ctm can be translated to a dynamical equation for the geometry of the emergent space .",
    "the form of the latter equation would be highly interesting to study , since ctm is known to have intimate connections to general relativity @xcite .",
    "it would also be interesting to see whether the tensors generating extended spaces are dynamically favoured or not , since quantum gravity should provide some explanations for our actual spacetime .",
    "interestingly , the non - local part of the tensor has precisely the form which is equivalent to an addition of a negative cosmological constant in the framework of ctm @xcite .",
    "then the two main implications of this paper , emergent spaces on boundaries and necessity of negative cosmological constants for stability , curiously resembles a part of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite in string theory .",
    "it has also been argued that the tensor networks ( though not random ) are discrete realizations of the ads spaces @xcite .",
    "showing any connections between our framework and the ads / cft correspondence is presently far beyond our scope , but the resemblance would at least suggest an interesting direction of study : not only boundaries , but random networks themselves may also have effective geometries , as the bulk geometries of the ads spaces .",
    "this contradicts the difficulties mentioned in section  [ sec : space ] , but there would remain the possibility that such classical geometries on randomly connected tensor networks would appear in certain sophisticated limits of the parameters , as the bulk geometries of ads in string theory have definite meanings only in semi - classical limits .",
    "obviously , putting matters on the emergent space would also be an interesting direction of study .",
    "this would be possible by considering tensors more complex than this paper , and the super - extension discussed in @xcite .",
