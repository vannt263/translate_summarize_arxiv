    "it is possible to extend this contracted product to higher - order tensors , but it lacks the closure property on odd - order tensors ( as the example on vectors showed ) .",

    "@xcite proposed an interesting tensor multiplication for third - order tensors based on circulant matrices .",
    "a standard @xmath11-circulant @xmath12 matrix @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) is defined completely by its first row as @xmath13 , where subtraction is done modulo @xmath14 : @xmath15 we view third - order tensors @xmath16 as a sequence of matrices @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "then , their _ circulant _ product @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( viewed as a sequence of matrices ) with @xmath23 .",
    "this tensor multiplication has the important closure property lacking in a contracted product and allows a singular value decomposition to be defined easily for third - order tensors ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that @xmath22 is simply the _ convolution _ between the two matrix sequences @xmath17 and @xmath18 , since @xmath24 . by viewing a matrix as a sequence of vectors",
    ", we can use the circulant - based tensor multiplication to define a tensor - matrix product similarly .    a fundamental fact in linear algebra states that the set of @xmath12 matrices is isomorphic to the set of linear transformations over the vector space @xmath25 .",
    "a matrix @xmath8 linearly maps a vector @xmath9 to another vector @xmath26 through a matrix - vector product @xmath27  or   @xmath28 , defined using a contracted product .",
    "this observation is difficult to generalize for odd - order tensors since the matrix - vector product does not map a vector space to itself .",
    "building on the work in @xcite , braman @xcite proved the following surprising property of third - order tensors : the set of all third - order tensors form precisely the set of linear transformations on a module ( vector space over ring ) defined by second - order tensors ( matrices ) with scalars from first - order tensors ( vectors ) .",
    "in this sense , braman s result recovered the fundamental isomorphism between matrices and linear transformations on a vector space ( over a field ) .",
    "this answered one of the main questions posed in @xcite : _ to characterize exactly the objects operated on by ( third - order ) tensors_.    braman s construction relied on a set of carefully defined products between vectors ( namely , @xmath29 ) , between vectors and matrices ( namely , @xmath30 ) , and also the circulant product between third - order tensors ( namely , @xmath31 ) which also includes a product between third - order tensors and matrices ( namely , @xmath32 ) .",
    "figure [ figure : products ] contains a description of these products and their definitions in @xcite . using these products ,",
    "braman proved that the set of matrices forms a unitary free module with scalars that are vectors .",
    "moreover , any third - order tensor is a linear transformation over this module and any linear transformation over the module can be represented as a third - order tensor .",
    "an interesting diagonalization theorem for third - order tensors was also proved which recovers the eigenvalue - eigenvector equations for diagonalizable matrices .",
    "this answered another main question posed in @xcite : _ to determine the singular or eigenvalues of tensors and to see if these are possibly vectors rather than scalars_.

    "first , we show that all of the different products defined in the construction are , in fact , convolutions in various group rings .",
    "this provides a unifying picture to braman s construction on third - order tensors .",
    "then , we extend the construction to arbitrary order tensors ( beyond third - order ) by viewing the set of tensors equipped with addition and convolution product as a ( commutative ) ring with identity .",
    "this extends previous constructions which defined the tensors over the field of real or complex numbers .",
    "our generalization also allows the underlying circulant matrices to be generalized to any _ abelian _ group - theoretic circulant . within our algebraic setting",
    ", we also identified braman s clever choice of a basis for the unitary free module of matrices , which is not the natural basis for this group ring .",
