    "in the unified model for agn , radio galaxies are usually assumed as parent objects for radio loud quasars and bl lac objects .",
    "this theory predicts that the doppler effect in relativistic jets and the presence of an obscuring torus around the agn , with different position angles with respect to the line of sight , can explain the various properties of powerful radio galaxies ( fr ii ) and radio loud quasars [ 1,2 ] .",
    "the unification of low luminosity radio galaxies ( mostly fr i ) with bl lac objects in principle does not require a thick absorbing torus [ 3 ] , however its presence is not ruled out [ 1 ] .",
    "this possibility could be supported by the detection in fr i radio sources of an increasing x - ray flux at energies above @xmath2 kev , where the contribution from the thermal component is very low and the photoelectric absorption of the torus becomes negligible . for the evaluation of the orientation of the agn - torus system ,",
    "a useful parameter is @xmath3 , the ratio between the core and the lobe radio fluxes at a given frequency . in sources with low values of @xmath3",
    "we expect the absorbing torus to be almost edge - on .    in the framework of this problem ,",
    "we have observed with bepposax a sample of 5 low power radio galaxies extracted from the 2 jy sample of morganti et al . [ 4 ] .",
    "the targets ( see table 1 ) , selected with @xmath4 , are all but one members of clusters .",
    "their morphology is mostly typical as for fr i radio sources , however a member of the sample ( 0625 - 53 ) belongs to the class of low - excitation fr ii radio galaxies [ 5 ] .    ",

    "the pds data have been reduced with the xas software , and a significative flux has been detected only from the source 0625 - 53 , with a count rate @xmath74 s@xmath75 . the spectral analysis has been performed with the xanadu package , rebinning the events in order to have at least 20 counts per energy channel in the mecs , and 10 counts in the pds . concerning the lecs data ,",
    "the flux for 3c 78 and 0620 - 52 is too weak for a useful analysis .",

    "we discuss separately the spectral properties deduced from the mecs and pds observations .      in the mecs all the sources appear extended , with radii @xmath76 kpc for 3c 78 , @xmath77 kpc for 0625 - 53 , oh 342 and 0620 - 52 , and @xmath78 mpc for her a. this",
    "is expected taking into account that four targets belong to clusters , while 3c 78 is an isolated galaxy but embedded in a hot galactic corona .",
    "consistently , from the spectral analysis we see that all the sources can be satisfactorily fitted with a thermal spectrum ( raymond - smith ) , where the iron line appears quite evident .",
    "the spectral parameters , with the hydrogen column density kept fixed to its galactic value n@xmath79 , are reported in table 3 .",
    "we have also tested that fits with power law spectra are much worse .",
    "however , even though the thermal spectrum is consistent with the data , the following points must be remarked :    \\1 ) in three sources ( 3c78 , oh 342 and her a ) a count excess is evident at high energies ( @xmath80 kev ) .",
    "\\2 ) the temperature obtained for the halo of 3c 78 is higher than expected for hot galactic coronae ( @xmath81 kev [ 6,7,8 ] ) .",
    "\\3 ) the temperature of the intracluster gas of her a is higher than obtained from a rosat observation in the soft x - ray energy band [ 9 ] .",
    "these issues suggest that a second component can be present in the spectrum of the sources . in the framework of our initial discussion",
    ", we have assumed that this second component may be related to the non - thermal emission from the central nucleus , surrounded by an obscuring torus seen edge - on .    due to the low photon flux",
    ", the fit with a double spectrum does not provide useful results unless some parameters are fixed .",
    "we have seen that the best fits are obtained only whether a high absorption is assumed for the non - thermal component .",
    "therefore , besides the galactic hydrogen column density n@xmath82 , we have fixed the value of the hydrogen column density of the absorbing torus n@xmath83 @xmath84 , the metallicity of the thermal component @xmath85 ( in units of the standard cosmic values ) , and the photon index of the power law spectrum @xmath86 . for three sources ( 3c78 , oh 342 and 3c78 )",
    "the presence of an absorbed non - thermal component is consistent with the data , as we can see in the unfolded spectra plotted in figs . 1 and 2 . the luminosity associated with the non - thermal emission from these agn is @xmath87 erg s@xmath75 in the mecs energy range ( it is quite outstanding the high nuclear luminosity of her a ) .",
    "with respect to the case of a single thermal spectrum , now the temperature of the hot gas in these objects is quite lower ( see table 4 ) .      in the mecs ,",
    "the data of 0625 - 53 ( associated with the cluster abell 3391 ) are fully dominated by the emission of the intracluster gas .",
    "this thermal spectrum can not be related to the high energy flux detected in the pds , as we can see in fig .",
    "3 . assuming that this emission originates from nucleus of the radio galaxy , and is non - thermal with a photon index @xmath86",
    ", we deduce a luminosity @xmath88 erg s@xmath75 , in the energy range @xmath89 kev .",
    "this also implies that this spectral component must have a cut - off at energies @xmath90 kev , consistent with a hydrogen column density n@xmath91 @xmath84 .",
    "we must remark however that we can not exclude at the moment that the detected flux originates from a foreground hard x - ray source in the field of view of the pds ( survey still in progress ) .",
    "from the mecs observations of the five radio galaxies of our sample , an absorbed non - thermal emission seems to be present in 3c78 , oh 342 and her a , that can be associated with the active nucleus surrounded by a thick obscuring torus .",
    "a similar interpretation can also hold for the radio galaxy 0625 - 53 , but at much higher energies .",
    "should this scenario be confirmed by detailed observations of a larger sample of low power radio galaxies , then the unified scheme proposed for fr ii - radio loud quasars ( doppler beaming plus absorbing torus ) could be also valid for fr i - bl lac objects",
