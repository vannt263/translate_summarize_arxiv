    "ultrastrong coupling between two systems is realized when the characteristic coupling constant of the interaction is of the same order of magnitude as the bare frequencies of the systems without interaction .",
    "although this definition is meaningful regardless of the type of interaction , in reality it is only the electromagnetic interaction that allows for such level of control on the quantum scale as is necessary for any chance at ultrastrong coupling .",
    "reaching the ultrastrong - coupling regime is an outstanding objective in controlled laboratory systems where confined electromagnetic radiation interacts with some kind of material degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "it would mean the realization of hybrid light - matter `` molecules '' .",
    "on one hand , the essential hybridization of electronic states by photons leads to fundamental effects , such as the dynamical casimir effect @xcite or quantum criticality @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the external control over the properties of such artificial objects opens the way to novel electro - optical applications where the `` light - matter molecule '' serves as a quantum interface between degrees of freedom of completely different kinds .",
    "the possibility of reaching an interaction of such strength touches unavoidably upon the foundations of the electromagnetic interaction in those system ( quantum electrodynamics ",
    "qed ) . in the present paper , we aim at theoretically clarifying the grounds for ultrastrong coupling of light with atoms .    in our recent work @xcite ,",
    "we generalized the power  zineau  woolley ( pzw ) gauge @xcite ( cf . also section iv.c in @xcite ) to arbitrary confined geometry , which includes any cavity qed situation , and is hence of fundamental importance for defining single- or few - mode models that are widely used in quantum optics .",
    "we argued that this picture is better suited as a basis of such models than the coulomb gauge , because of the lack of direct coupling between the modes ( which is present in the coulomb gauge through the a - square term ) , and the lack of direct , electrostatic atom - atom interactions ( which is also present in the coulomb gauge ) .",
    "indeed , a term - by - term correspondence between the full hamiltonian in the new picture and standard model hamiltonians of quantum optics ( jaynes  cummings or rabi models ) was found @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of using this gauge is that the feasibility of the superradiant phase transition in the dicke model can not be excluded by the commonly known no - go theorem based on the a - square term @xcite .",
    "however , the evaluation of the accessible coupling strength requires the clarification of the polarization field used to describe the material component in the pzw gauge .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper for the case of a medium composed of isolated atoms .",
    "the single - atom hamiltonian in the pzw gauge ( also called multipolar gauge ) can be expressed as @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes a single atom , @xmath2 labels the constituent point charges , @xmath3 is the momentum of the point charge in the new picture , and @xmath4 is the polarization field associated with the atom . the second term in this hamiltonian , which can be viewed as the `` potential '' term , can be problematic .",
    "this is the case for the intuitive choice of @xmath4 , known as the power form ( section iv.c.1.a in @xcite ) , which is directly based on the point - charge distribution within the atom : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the charge and @xmath7 is its position .",
    "this form is a distribution , so that ( [ eq : singleatomnew ] ) contains a distribution squared , that is mathematically ill defined . in this paper",
    "we present an alternative definition of the polarization field which gives a meaningful `` potential term '' in the single - atom hamiltonian and , at the same time , retains the good property that there is no direct electrostatic interaction between different atoms .",
    "the proposed definition allows thus for exploring the limits of ultrastrong coupling between atomic matter and light .",
    "the discussion is structured in the following way .",
    "we start , in section [ sec : overview ] , with pointing out that the definition of the pzw canonical transformation has a freedom , namely , the freedom of choosing the transverse part of the polarization field .",
    "we identify the restrictions this field has to meet . in section [ sec : choiceofp_trans ] , using this freedom , we define the transverse part of the polarization field generated by spatially distinct , well - localized , neutral charge clusters ( atoms ) . with the proposed definition ,",
    "the passage to the multipolar gauge is in fact a class of transformations parametrized by a single wavenumber - cutoff parameter .",
    "we show how to define bounds for the cutoff wavenumber on intuitive physical basis .",
    "the lower comes from the requirement of the disappearance of the a - square term ( section [ sec : lowerlimit ] ) , while the upper from that the potential term in hamiltonian ( [ eq : singleatomnew ] ) be only a slightly perturbed coulomb potential ( section [ sec : upperlimit ] ) .    with this appropriate choice , in section [ sec : limits ] , we arrive at a picture where the atoms interact exclusively via the radiation modes of the electromagnetic field by means of photon emission and absorption processes .",
    "since the instantaneous electrostatic dipole - dipole coulomb interaction between spatially distinct atoms is canceled , the atoms have well - defined resonances regardless of the presence of other atoms .",
    "thus , the commonly used few - mode models , such as the dicke model , can be straightforwardly defined .",
    "the necessary requirement is that the atoms do not approach each other within the distance corresponding to the cutoff , i.e. , they all are surrounded by an `` intimacy zone '' .",
    "therefore , on the other hand , the proposed gauge is unsuited for describing molecule formation or solidification .",
    "this is to be noted because our results indicate that the superradiant quantum phase transition accompanied by ferroelectric ordering of the atoms in the dipolar hamiltonian ( most simply in the dicke model ) blends into that commonly observed phase transition which is solidification .",
    "nevertheless , sufficiently far from the regime of molecule formation , the proposed gauge can be used to evaluate the limitation of ultrastrong coupling within the dicke and related models .",
    "the hamiltonian in the multipolar gauge reads @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hamiltonian of the free electric field , @xmath10 is the kinetic energy of the atoms , and @xmath11 is the ( purely transverse ) electric displacement field .",
    "@xmath12 is the polarization field , which plays a crucial role in this gauge .",
    "this satisfies the relation @xmath13 that connects the polarization field to the charges , however , since @xmath14 , it relates _ only _ to the longitudinal component of the field .",
    "equivalently : @xmath15 meaning that the part of the electric field which is attached to the charges and follows their motion instantaneously ( the so - called `` near field '' ) , is incorporated into the polarization field , that represents the material component of the interacting system .    besides @xmath16 , the other orthogonal component of @xmath12 is the transverse component , @xmath17 .",
    "transverse fields are source - free and normal to boundaries , that is , they can either be written as curl of vector fields normal to boundaries , or are cohomological @xcite . we emphasize again that the transverse component of the polarization field _ is not determined by the charges _ in such a direct way as eq .",
    "( [ eq : plongfromcharges ] ) for the longitudinal one . instead , it has to obey a set of conditions in order that the multipolar gauge be really useful .",
    "the first comes from the requirement of the `` elimination of the a - square term '' to electric - dipole order ( see eq .",
    "( 5c ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that we expect from this gauge :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the position of that atom @xmath1 to which the particle @xmath2 with position @xmath7 and charge @xmath6 , belongs .",
    "this makes the kinetic momentum coincide with the canonical one up to a magnetic term ( rntgen term , cf .",
    "section iv.c.4.c in @xcite ) , which we neglect here . ) eliminates the a - square term only in a long - wavelength approximation because the condition for exact cancellation would read ( cf .",
    "@xcite eq .",
    "( 15))@xmath20 this condition can not be met _ exactly _ because the lhs , being a gradient of a scalar field , is curlfree ( meaning curl with respect to @xmath7 ) , but the rhs is not .",
    "this argument is removed by the long - wavelength approximation because in ( [ cond : asquare ] ) both sides have vanishing curl with respect to @xmath7 . ]",
    "the next condition is necessary for eliminating the electrostatic dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms in this gauge , which means that the medium can be considered as independent atoms ( elimination of cross - coupling in the p - square term ) .",
    "it requires that @xmath4 , the polarization field corresponding to any single atom @xmath1 ( so that the full polarization is @xmath21 ) , have finite support around the atomic position .",
    "the size of the support can be a parameter that for instance will play an important role with our choice of @xmath17 in section  [ sec : choiceofp_trans ] .",
    "this fact of finite support we express here with the help of the `` long - wavelength '' delta function as : @xmath22 through the example of our choice of @xmath17 , in section  [ sec : choiceofp_trans ] we will discuss why and in what sense the equality is only approximate here . for the moment it is sufficient that the field @xmath4 should describe a well - localized dipole when regarded on a lengthscale much larger than the atomic size .    under this last condition , and assuming the atoms distant enough from each other so that the supports of their respective @xmath4 fields do not overlap , the third term of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] )  the potential term  can be written as per atom :    @xmath23 which means that the only interaction between different atoms is the indirect one via the displacement field @xmath11 , that involves the emission and absorption of photons , included in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) by its last term .",
    "this leads us to the final condition that @xmath24 has to satisfy for each atom @xmath1 .",
    "the potential corresponding to atom @xmath1 can be separated into parts generated by the longitudinal and the transverse part of the polarization field , where the longitudinal part can be identified ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : plongfromelectricfield ] ) , and section i.b.5.a in @xcite ) as the coulomb potential term : @xmath25 then , the last condition is that the potential generated by the transverse part be only a perturbation to the normal coulomb potential , because we do not want to upset atomic physics as it has been worked out over the last century based in leading order on the electrons experiencing the coulomb potential as they orbit the nucleus .",
    "@xmath26    in section [ sec : limits ] , we show how to proceed under this set of conditions to the derivation of the standard models of quantum optics .",
    "the following form for the transverse part of the polarization field we demonstrate in the following to optimally fulfill the set conditions :    [ eq : lwdeltafunction ] @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dipole moment of atom @xmath1 , and we have used the long - wavelength part of the transverse delta function , most conveniently defined by a lorentzian cutoff in k - space at the cutoff wavenumber @xmath29 : @xmath30 where we have assumed @xmath31 for the single atom @xmath1 that we are going to consider henceforth in this section . using the real - space form of this , we get for @xmath32 @xmath33,\\\\\\text{with}\\quad\\eta(r)=1-\\left(1+{k_\\text{m}}r+\\frac{{k_\\text{m}}^2r^2}2\\right ) e^{-{k_\\text{m}}r}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    as it is apparent , this is just the electric field of a dipole , so that this choice of @xmath34 cancels the dipole order of the longitudinal component ( [ eq : plongfromelectricfield ] ) , outside a distance @xmath35 .",
    "this makes that the support of @xmath36 is indeed finite in dipole order , that is , the atoms interact only in quadrupole order , which we are neglecting here .",
    "hence , ( [ cond : atomicdipoles ] ) is fulfilled up to dipole order , which we consider sufficient for our purposes here , and is in accordance with the neglect of the rntgen term above.^2)$ ] , while the dipole term would be @xmath37 , @xmath38 being the bohr radius ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : upperlimit ] ) , for which @xmath39 holds .",
    "] this is the sense in which the equality in ( [ cond : atomicdipoles ] ) is fulfilled only approximately : up to dipole order and without a region of @xmath40 around the atom .",
    "this latter is the _ intimacy region _ of an atom : the interaction between different atoms simplifies substantially to the indirect interaction mediated by the radiation field modes only if they do not penetrate each other s intimacy region .",
    "this is also a point where our approach manifestly deviates from the original power ",
    "woolley approach , since with power s original definition of the polarization field ( [ eq : powerp ] ) , it exactly vanishes outside of zero - measure regions within the atom ( on the other hand , ( [ cond : perturbation ] ) is impossible to fulfill with that choice of the polarization field ) .    in our case ,",
    "the cutoff wavenumber @xmath29 is not a renormalization parameter , but parametrizes a class of allowed transformations . in the following , we use the remaining two conditions ( [ cond : asquare ] ) and ( [ cond : perturbation ] ) to define an interval for @xmath29 .",
    "the lower limit comes from ( [ cond : asquare ] ) as follows .",
    "taking the free - space traveling - wave expansion of the vector potential @xmath41 $ ] , and substituting into the lhs of ( [ cond : asquare ] ) with our choice of @xmath17 ( [ eq : choiceofs_freespace ] ) , we obtain @xmath42\\\\\\equiv q_\\alpha{\\mathbf{a}}_<(0).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] that is , if @xmath43 for @xmath44 in the course of the dynamics , so that we can write @xmath45 , then ( [ cond : asquare ] ) is fulfilled . hence the lower limit for @xmath29 :    @xmath46    in simple terms , the atom has to be small compared to the wavelength of populated modes , represented by @xmath47 .",
    "this is usually termed the dipole approximation , or , more precisely , the long - wavelength approximation . in the case of a hydrogen atom and optical frequencies",
    ", there are roughly 3 orders of magnitude between the atomic size and the characteristic wavenumber of the atomic transitions .",
    "this can be seen by expressing the characteristic transition frequency with fundamental constants as @xmath48 , and using @xmath49 to obtain    @xmath50 where @xmath2 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath51 determines the wavenumber of the relevant resonant radiation modes ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the long - wavelength approximation is an elementary requirement for atom optics , because in this field we need well - defined atoms with level structures determined by a static potential , and radiative effects on the atomic scale are treated as mere perturbations .",
    "the upper limit comes from ( [ cond : perturbation ] ) as follows . with our choice of the transverse polarization field ( [ eq : choiceofs_freespace ] ) , we can take the potential resulting from @xmath17 seriously as a physically significant potential .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to power s choice , since in that case the `` perturbation '' is infinite and calls for renormalization .",
    "the finite and regular potential @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : perturbationdefined ] ) resulting from the proposed polarization field @xmath17 is @xmath54 this potential term manifests that the atom is defined in the multipolar gauge differently from the one in coulomb gauge , i.e. , the gauge transformation shifts the boundary between atom and field .    to keep our discussion as simple as possible , the effect of this potential",
    "will be calculated in the example of the 1s state of the hydrogen atom by time - independent perturbation theory . to be able to do quantum physics",
    ", the potential has to be treated as an operator acting on the hilbert space of the atom s constituents . here",
    ", this consists in considering the positions of the atomic constituents appearing in @xmath55 as quantum operators . for the hydrogen atom , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the relative coordinate ,",
    "so that the perturbing potential reads @xmath58 the 1s wave function of the electron reads @xmath59 , where @xmath38 is the bohr radius .",
    "the first - order perturbation reads : @xmath60 let us compare this energy to the binding energy of the hydrogen atom , the rydberg energy .",
    "we find the following remarkably simple expression : @xmath61 hence ( [ cond : perturbation ] ) is translated to an upper limit of the cutoff wavenumber as    @xmath62    the cubic power in this expression makes that e.g. a cutoff of @xmath63 already gives about @xmath64 for the energy ratio  ( [ eq : energyratio ] ) .",
    "that is , an intimacy region compressed to nearly the atomic size can be chosen without significantly altering the usual coulomb - potential form of the atomic hamilton operator .",
    "we note that the lamb shift is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath53 @xcite , but it should be treated separately , since it comes from the _ interaction with the vacuum field , _ that is , the last term of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "with the transverse polarization fulfilling all the conditions considered above , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is greatly simplified in the electric dipole approximation to read    @xmath65 where the replacement of the interaction term ( last term of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ) with the last term of @xmath66 here is justified under  ( [ cond : atomicdipoles ] ) in the long - wavelength approximation for the displacement field equivalent to the one discussed in section [ sec : lowerlimit ] .",
    "the significance of this form is that the standard models of quantum optics can be derived from here through two well - established approximations : ( i ) the single - mode approximation for the field , when the field is described as a single harmonic oscillator mode with bosonic operator @xmath67 ; and ( ii ) the two - level approximation for the atoms , when the atomic ensemble can be treated as a spin @xmath68 , with spin operators @xmath69 , @xmath70 , etc .",
    "this yields models like the dicke and ( with an additional rotating - wave approximation ) the tavis ",
    "cummings , whose respective hamiltonians correspond term by term to the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonianed ] ) : @xmath71 the important point here is that no _ term _ of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonianed ] ) had to be neglected , so that the a - square ( direct coupling between the modes ) or p - square problems ( direct electrostatic coupling between the atoms ) @xcite do not appear in this treatment .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to a treatment based on the coulomb gauge , where e.g. the a - square problem initiated an intense debate concerning the qualitative validity of the dicke model @xcite .",
    "we are now in the position of addressing the question what is the maximum coupling strength achievable between the atomic medium and a radiation field mode .",
    "the limitation arises from the requirement that the interatomic distance in the many - atom ensemble must respect the intimacy region of the individual atoms .    for the collective coupling of atoms to light in the models ( [ eq : standardmodels ] ) , the figure of merit pertaining to ultrastrong coupling is the ratio @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of atoms , @xmath74 is the frequency of a radiation mode , @xmath75 is the resonance frequency associated with a relevant electronic transition within an atom , and @xmath76 is the electric - dipole coupling constant , cf .",
    "( [ eq : standardmodels ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath77 corresponds to the critical point of the dicke model , predicting a superradiant phase transition into such a ground state of the system as features spontaneous polarization @xcite .",
    "the coupling @xmath76 depends on the mode geometry and the oscillator strength of the atomic transition . in the qed picture used here , its square",
    "can be written the same way as in the electric - dipole gauge of qed : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the mode volume and @xmath80 is the dipole moment of the atomic transition along the mode polarization .",
    "note that the use of all the microscopic parameters ( @xmath80 , @xmath75 , etc . )",
    "is justified here by the lack of cross - coupling in the `` p - square term '' of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) : without electrostatic atom - atom interaction , the presence of other atoms does not alter the atomic level structure .",
    "the figure of merit can be expressed in two instructive forms .",
    "firstly :    [ eq : naiveargument ] @xmath81 where we use the quality factor of the atomic resonance @xmath82 with @xmath83 being the linewidth ( half width at half maximum ) and @xmath84 the wavelength .",
    "this form expresses that the density @xmath85 must be large to compensate for the large quality factor of an atomic resonance in the denominator ( for alkali atoms this is @xmath86 ) . in order to get deeper insight into scaling laws",
    ", we consider transitions between hydrogen - like ground and excited states , and find the second form : @xmath87    where @xmath38 is the bohr radius .",
    "that is , in order to have @xmath88 , the atomic medium should be so dense that one atom occurs per about 4 bohr radius cube .",
    "this density is noticeably close to the limit allowed by the maximum of the cutoff parameter @xmath29 given by ( [ eq : upperlimit ] ) , i.e. , @xmath89 , indicating an interatomic distance just around 4 bohr radius .",
    "this means that we can approach the critical - coupling point in the ultrastrong regime with an ensemble of independent atoms , i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "however , this happens at the density when the intimacy regions of adjacent atoms touch .",
    "further increasing the density , the independent - atom model breaks down and electrostatic interactions become relevant .",
    "moreover , at such a small atomic distance , the overlap between the exponentially decaying electron wavefunctions ( @xmath91 ) belonging to different atoms becomes significant .",
    "such a delocalization of electronic orbits would lead to covalent bond between atoms , but this effect is not described by our model , as here the electrons do not experience the electrostatic potential of other nuclei .",
    "the role of electron - orbit delocalization at such high densities can be revealed by comparing the critical density @xmath92 for rubidium ( calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : naiveargumentone ] ) by putting @xmath77 ) to the crystalline density @xmath93 .",
    "we find similar correspondencies also for other species used in atomic optics experiments .",
    "one can thus conjecture that the superradiant criticality blends into the commonly known criticality of solidification . ) , _ in the dipolar picture , _ the figure of merit depends only on atomic parameters , as the mode frequency drops out from the expression of @xmath94 ( this would not happen in coulomb gauge ) .",
    "this means that the dicke critical point ( @xmath77 ) is determined by the bohr radius ( or , for alkaline atoms , the corresponding atomic size ) , @xmath38 . in an atom - picture based on the coulomb potential , which is scale - less",
    ", there is only this single atomic lenghtscale , which determines also the covalent - bond distance . as there is no free parameter for nature to separately tune the dicke critical and the solidification point ,",
    "the similarity of the two is not a mere coincidence . ]",
    "we considered the quantum electrodynamic foundations of the interaction of atoms with light .",
    "in particular , we analysed in detail how the atomic medium can be defined in terms of a polarization field such that the atom - atom interactions simplify to an indirect coupling via the radiation field modes .",
    "the main difference of our approach compared to the usual treatment of the pzw transformation is that while @xmath16 is kept exactly to represent the charge distribution via eq .",
    "( [ eq : plongfromcharges ] ) , we acknowledge that we have a freedom in choosing the transverse part of the polarization field .",
    "we determined the full set of conditions ( [ cond : asquare ]  [ cond : perturbation ] ) that the transverse polarization field in the power ",
    "woolley canonical transformation has to obey .    with this background",
    ", we identified an upper limit on the coupling between atomic medium and radiation .",
    "this limit comes close to criticality in the ultrastrong coupling regime , but at this point such physical effects start to play a role as molecule formation and solidification , that rule out the treatment of matter as independent electric dipoles .",
    "this also shows that  barring artificial open systems like circuit cavity qed or such special model systems of e.g. the dicke model as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , systems not based on a gas of dipoles interacting with the electromagnetic field  the ultrastrong critical coupling can eventually be reached by such polarizable medium as is compacted into a solid .    as an outlook , we note that to go beyond the limit we concluded , one should abandon the isolated - atom picture , and allow the atoms to penetrate each other s intimacy zone .",
    "this situation could be studied by a many - body model with a hard - core inter - atomic potential .",
    "the determination of the form of this potential and the study of such a many - body model is currently under way by the authors .",
