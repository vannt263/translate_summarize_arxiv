    "[ intro ] the @xmath1-bps sector of @xmath2 @xmath3 yang ",
    "mills theory provides a simple playground for understanding quantum gravity , as the semiclassical mapping between spacetime geometries and coherent field theoretic states is particularly simple @xcite .",
    "here we propose an extension of this mapping to the quantum level .",
    "using a second - quantized formalism , we define a ` metric ' operator in the yang - mills theory whose eigenstates map to universes with a single well - defined topology and geometry , while non - eigenstates do not have a good description in terms of single spacetimes .    in the field theory ,",
    "the half - bps states can be constructed by reducing the @xmath3 yang - mills lagrangian to a hermitian matrix model and studying its hilbert space @xcite .",
    "this in turn has a description in terms of @xmath4 fermions in a harmonic potential .",
    "approximate eigenstates of our metric operator can be constructed by placing the individual fermions in coherent states .",
    "( see @xcite for a related discussion in the @xmath5 context . ) using this formalism , we can associate an entropy to any classical , asymptotically @xmath6 spacetime in the llm family given by @xcite , by counting how many microscopic configurations give the same coarse - grained metric .",
    "we find that only the singular spacetimes have a finite entropy ; thus spacetime singularities and the appearance of gravitational entropy are intimately tied together , at least within the class of llm geometries . by studying the partition sum over geometries",
    "we show that only the smooth spacetimes appear in the underlying configuration space , which is thus effectively discretized .",
    "this provides further evidence that singularities and their associated entropy arise only in passing to our long - distance effective description .",
    "our formalism can be used to determine the most entropic geometries with specified angular moments ; in essence , this extends the extremal `` superstar '' black hole geometry to black objects carrying higher angular moments .",
    "the data required for constructing the metric in these half - bps universes can be extracted from the effective single - particle phase space distribution of the fermionic representation of the half - bps matrix model .",
    "this procedure generically loses information about the complete state , which is fully represented in an @xmath4-particle phase space .",
    "hence the semiclassical geometry will generally lose information about the underlying quantum state .",
    "we show that in the semiclassical limit ( @xmath7 ) this sort of information loss occurs if and only if the metric is singular .",
    "while this paper was in preparation we received @xcite which has substantial overlap with some sections of this paper , and @xcite which carries out similar analyses of the entropy of coarse - grained bps spacetimes in other settings .",
    "[ [ gravity ] ] gravity : + + + + + + + + +    type iib string theory in 10 dimensions has a family of asymptotically @xmath0 solutions that preserve 16 supercharges ; these are the @xmath1-bps states .",
    "of particular interest are the subset of states that preserve an additional @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "all states in this subset were written down in @xcite and are of the form @xmath9 where the coefficients are given by @xmath10 and are entirely specified by the function @xmath11 .",
    "the one - form field @xmath12 can also be given in terms of @xmath13 , but it will not be needed here . note that @xmath14 and @xmath15 have units of length squared .",
    "this function in turn solves a harmonic equation in @xmath16 and is determined by its boundary condition on the @xmath17 plane @xmath18 ( we will frequently drop the arguments and simply call this function @xmath13 . ) on this space of solutions it can be shown @xcite that the hamiltonian is @xmath19 the flux of @xmath20 passing through the asymptotic @xmath21 in such spaces is @xmath22 it turns out that the solutions ( [ llmsolution ] ) are singular unless @xmath23 everywhere .",
    "when @xmath24 or @xmath25 the solutions have closed timelike curves @xcite , so we will always take @xmath26 .",
    "[ [ field - theory ] ] field theory : + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the dual @xmath27 @xmath3 yang - mills theory on @xmath28 the corresponding states preserve 16 supersymmetries . due to the bps condition",
    "these states are constant on the @xmath29 , leading to an @xmath30 symmetry .",
    "when one constructs states using only one of the three complex scalar fields , the internal @xmath31 r - symmetry is broken to @xmath30 .",
    "thus these states have the same symmetries as the gravity solutions described above",
    ".    it has been shown @xcite that all of these states can be described in terms of a matrix model for the one homogenous mode of the complex adjoint scalar field : @xmath32 the dictionary relating that yang - mills theory to string theory ensures that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is planck s constant governing the semiclassical limit of ( [ ymaction ] ) and @xmath35 is the 10 dimensional planck length governing the semiclassical limit on the gravity side . the matrix model ( [ ymaction ] ) can be solved in the usual way by going to the eigenvalue basis , in which case it reduces to a system of @xmath4 non - interacting fermions in a harmonic potential .",
    "a basis for the hilbert space is specified by a set of non - decreasing integers @xmath36 which measure the excitation of each fermion above the vacuum .",
    "the data @xmath37 may be summarized in a young diagram in which the @xmath38 row has length @xmath39 . in the semiclassical limit",
    ", it has been proposed that these states are mapped to the dual solutions ( [ llmsolution ] ) with the identification into the definition of @xmath40 in comparison with @xcite in order to maintain consistency with sec .",
    "4.2 of @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath40 is the semiclassical density of fermions in the single particle harmonic oscillator phase plane @xmath42 .",
    "there are many different quantum mechanical density functions on phase space ; however , all well - defined phase space distributions share the same semiclassical limit .",
    "thus we will mostly work with the well - known wigner density function ( see appendix a ) and occasionally with the husimi distribution ( see sec .",
    "[ husimisec ] ) that is obtained by convolving the wigner distribution with a coherent state @xcite .",
    "[ [ integrable - charges ] ] integrable charges : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in @xcite we pointed out that the half - bps sector of @xmath43 yang - mills theory is integrable and thus has a family of higher hamiltonians @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the hamiltonian in the free fermion hilbert space and @xmath46 is the energy of the @xmath47 fermion in units of @xmath34 . this can be written in terms of a phase space integral , and using the correspondence with spacetime ( [ uwcorrespond ] ) , becomes @xmath48 which is accurate to leading order in @xmath4 .",
    "any eigenstate of this tower of conserved charges can be completely identified by measurement of all the eigenvalues . in @xcite",
    "we showed that in the semiclassical limit these higher hamiltonians can be read off from the asymptotic angular moments of the spacetime . specifically , the k@xmath49 angular moment of the function @xmath11 that appears in ( [ llmsolution ] ) is proportional to the expected value of @xmath50 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath16 is the transverse direction to the @xmath53 plane , @xmath54 is the radial direction in this plane and @xmath55 is the angle between the plane and the transverse direction measured by @xmath56 . is independent of @xmath57 because we are dealing with energy eigenstates . ]",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that in typical states with a given total energy ( @xmath58 ) , planck scale measurements are required to distinguish between the microstates .",
    "hence information about these states is lost in the semiclassical limit .",
    "[ quantum ]    the naive correspondence ( [ uwcorrespond ] ) associates a geometry to every state in the hilbert space via the phase space fermion density in the free fermi description of the half - bps states .",
    "the correspondence can not be correct in this naive form ",
    "while a suitably coherent state in the field theory can correspond to a semiclassical geometry , there will be many states which correspond to wavefunctions that have support on spacetimes of widely different geometry and topology .",
    "thus it is of interest to identify which field theory states have a description in terms of a single classical geometry vs. a superposition of geometries . in this section , we will define a ` metric ' operator in the yang - mills theory and propose that the eigenstates of this operator are the ones that can be mapped to semiclassical geometries using ( [ uwcorrespond ] ) , while the non - eigenstates can not be associated to a unique metric in this manner .",
    "[ superstar - example ]     four cft states naively would be mapped to the superstar . ]    to illustrate the difficulty with the naive correspondence ( [ uwcorrespond ] ) we will consider different ways in which the extremal half - bps black hole ( the `` superstar '' @xcite ) would be generated by applying ( [ uwcorrespond ] ) to field theory states .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the metric ( [ llmsolution ] ) realizes the superstar geometry when the function @xmath59 ( [ udef ] ) takes a constant value between 0 and 1 within a circular droplet in the @xmath53 plane , and vanishes outside it .",
    "this @xmath13 function is depicted in the center of fig .",
    "[ superstars ] .",
    "it was also shown that a fermion basis state ( [ rdef ] ) described by a triangular young tableau ( upper left corner of fig .",
    "[ superstars ] ) has a phase space density of this form , and hence corresponds to a superstar geometry according to ( [ uwcorrespond ] ) .",
    "we will now examine other states in the field theory that have the same single particle wigner distribution .",
    "for definiteness , we choose , without loss of generality , to work with a droplet with @xmath60 inside the droplet . in terms of the triangular tableau , this corresponds to having an equal number of rows and columns ( @xmath61 ) @xcite , while for the superstar this means that the number of giant gravitons sourcing the geometry is equal to the flux of the five - form field @xcite .",
    "the radius of the droplet for this configuration is @xmath62 . and",
    "@xmath15 ( and therefore @xmath54 ) are ( length)@xmath63 . ] in terms of excitation numbers the triangular tableau state is given by @xmath64    another way of producing the superstar is to place the @xmath4 fermions in the field theory in coherent states that are randomly distributed in phase space inside the circle of radius @xmath62 ( upper right corner , fig .",
    "[ superstars ] ) . since coherent states are minimum uncertainty packets , as we will see in secs .",
    "[ coarsegrained ] and [ partition ] , they will cover half the area contained inside the circle . upon coarse graining at the @xmath34 scale",
    ", this configuration has a phase space distribution that is @xmath65 inside the circle and @xmath66 outside . upon using the correspondence ( [ uwcorrespond ] )",
    "we once again recover the superstar geometry .",
    "thirdly , we can consider a superposition of two very similar triangles , one with even excitations and one with odd excitations ( fig .",
    "[ superstars ] ; bottom right ) : @xmath67 and finally , we can consider the superposition of the empty tableau corresponding to the @xmath68 vacuum , and a square tableau of size @xmath69 ( fig .  [ superstars ] ; bottom left ) : @xmath70 the last two superpositions are also depicted in figure [ superstars ] .",
    "computing the corresponding phase space distributions ( following @xcite or ( [ eq : wigner ] ) later in this paper ) one can see that the phase space distributions corresponding to these states will indeed reproduce the superstar geometry upon coarse graining .",
    "the last two cases are both simple superpositions of basis states .",
    "however , the ` square + square ' example is more dramatic as it is a superposition of states of vastly different energies , unlike ` triangle + triangle ' .",
    "the energy associated to the @xmath68 vacuum is @xmath71 , while the energy of the @xmath72 tableau is @xmath73 for @xmath61 , yielding an average energy of @xmath74 .",
    "as soon as an observer performs even a rough measurement of the energy , the universe is projected into one of the two energy eigenstates . on the gravity side ,",
    "the corresponding geometries differ from each other ( and from the superstar ! ) at scales that are easily measurable , since the relevant scale is roughly the @xmath68 radius @xmath75 . thus ,",
    "` square + square ' does not describe anything like a classical superstar , and can only be described as a superposition of distinct geometries .",
    "we wish to develop a formalism that can distinguish states of this sort from the ones that can be usefully mapped to a unique metric",
    ".      it will be convenient to use a second quantized description of the fermion system .",
    "for each state @xmath76 in the 1-particle hilbert space @xmath77 , we define both a fermion creation operator @xmath78 and a fermion annihilation operator @xmath79 which satisfy    @xmath80    where the inner product on the right is taken in @xmath77 .",
    "since we deal with free fermions , the anti - commutators on the left - hand side of equations ( [ acom ] ) are proportional to the identity .",
    "thus it makes sense to set them equal to the complex numbers on the right - hand side",
    ".    we will in particular be interested in the case where @xmath76 is a coherent state labelled by a parameter @xmath81 . in phase space",
    "these states manifest themselves as gaussian wavepackets localized around @xmath82 , and are defined by @xmath83 throughout this section , the normalization conventions are as in @xcite .",
    "we shall abuse notation somewhat by taking @xmath84 to represent the creation and annihilation operators corresponding to the coherent state determined by @xmath81 .",
    "the simple form and well - known properties of the coherent state ( [ eq : coherent ] ) provide a convenient foundation upon which to base a semiclassical formalism .",
    "we make use of this opportunity in the rest of this work .",
    "however , in section [ discussion ] , we describe certain desirable improvements which , unfortunately , will come with increased technical complications .",
    "we wish to define a ` metric ' operator in the field theory with the property that its eigenstates are well described by a single classical metric which is in turn given by the eigenvalue of the operator .",
    "since any 1/2-bps metric may be expressed in terms of the function @xmath59 , it is enough to define an operator @xmath85 in terms of the fermion operators ; we can take all other metric operators to be given by the classical llm formulae with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath86 .",
    "we will see that , with our definition of @xmath86 below , such expressions will require no regularization .    for @xmath87 , we make the definition    @xmath88    and @xmath89 .",
    "thus , for each @xmath90 the operator @xmath91 is a fermion number operator , having eigenvalues 0 and 1 .",
    "our definition satisfies a number of useful properties .",
    "for example , we have @xmath92 these are precisely the relations which hold between the corresponding classical quantities .",
    "furthermore , one may show that these @xmath93 generate a complete set of operators which do not change fermion number . here",
    "the essential point is that any operator on the 1-particle hilbert space can be expressed in the form @xmath94 denotes the @xmath95 energy level of the 1-particle harmonic oscillator , we may define a complex function @xmath96 by @xmath97 it is then straightforward to show that @xmath98 it is clear that any operator which preserves particle number can be built by taking sums of products of @xmath99 , and thus that any such operator can be built from @xmath93 .",
    "we now wish to connect the operator @xmath100 to a semi - classical phase space distribution function by showing that the expectation value of @xmath100 in a general state @xmath101 is the husimi distribution on phase space : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the husimi distribution corresponding to the one particle density matrix @xmath104 associated to @xmath101 . to show this , we write the general state as a superposition of basis states as @xmath105 where @xmath106 sums over the basis states in the superposition , the normalization is @xmath107 and @xmath108 is the set of excitation numbers characterising a basis state @xmath109 .",
    "the basis states in turn are given by @xmath110 using the commutators ( [ acom ] ) one can show that @xmath111 the expectation value on the right side of the first line can clearly be nonzero only when at least @xmath112 of the excitation numbers in @xmath108 and @xmath113 are the same .",
    "this allowed us to simplify the expression at the cost of introducing some new notation . in the above",
    ", @xmath114 denotes the set of pairs of states that differ from each other by one excitation , and for each such pair we define the excitation to be @xmath115 .",
    "finally , @xmath116 indexes the number of the differing excitation , i.e. if @xmath117 , then @xmath118 .    next we need to evaluate the right hand side of ( [ husimi ] ) , and thus we recall the definition of the husimi distribution from @xcite : @xmath119 the one particle density matrix corresponding to @xmath120 can be easily found by tracing over @xmath112 of the particles . due to the orthogonality",
    ", the trace can also be nonzero only if at least @xmath121 of the excitations are the same , and after a little work we get @xmath122 ) .",
    "[ coarsegrained ] the metric operator @xmath100 is not well suited to a semiclassical observer , since it is very sensitive to details at the planck scale .",
    "thus , we wish to coarse grain it over some distance scale @xmath123 . to do this",
    ", we ll compute a convolution with a gaussian kernel : @xmath124 since this operator is essentially a weighted average of local values of @xmath100 , it will have a continuous spectrum of eigenvalues between 0 and 1 and it is not sensitive to details at the planck scale .",
    "this operator valued function on the single fermion phase space is our proposal for a `` metric operator '' , namely the operator whose eigenstates can be associated to semiclassical geometries using the llm prescription .    to make this more precise , we next need to define exactly what me mean by eigenstates and the semiclassical limit .",
    "the semiclassical limit can be defined simply as @xmath125    we can see that the commutator @xmath126 $ ] does not vanish , though it approaches zero rapidly when @xmath90 and @xmath127 are separated by more than a distance @xmath123 . as a result , only states which are eigenstates of the @xmath128 with eigenvalue @xmath129 or @xmath130 for all @xmath90 ( i.e. states with an empty or completely filled phase plane ) can be exact eigenstates of @xmath131 .",
    "neither of these possibilities is of interest .",
    "other states are only approximate eigenstates . for example , consider empty ads space , the vacuum of the theory . in terms of young tableaux for fermion excitation energies ,",
    "ads space is described as the empty tableau and the correspondence phase space density is the filled fermi sea , i.e. a filled disk of fermions in phase space . for @xmath132 well within the filled disk ,",
    "the state is an approximate eigenstate of @xmath133 with eigenvalue one .",
    "when @xmath132 is well outside the black disk , the state is an approximate eigenstate of @xmath133 with eigenvalue zero .",
    "however , when @xmath90 is within @xmath123 of the boundary , the state is far from being an eigenstate of @xmath133 .",
    "thus we will define approximate eigenstates as follows : we say that a state @xmath134 is an approximate eigenstate of @xmath133 with eigenvalue function @xmath135 and a given accuracy @xmath136 , if and only if @xmath137 with this definition we can easily see that of the four aspiring superstars introduced earlier , only ` square + square ' is not an approximate eigenstate of @xmath131 thus should nt be associated with the superstar geometry .",
    "armed with the definition of eigenstates of the coarse - grained @xmath138 , such eigenstates can be associated with a slowly - varying density function which we have called @xmath135 , and it is in terms of this function that we shall now discuss the thermodynamics and entropy of these solutions .",
    "following sec .",
    "[ 2nd ] all eigenstates of the metric operator can be constructed by placing each fermion in the free - fermi description of half - bps states in a coherent state in phase space .",
    "it is known that coherent states placed on an @xmath34-spaced lattice in phase space also provide a complete basis for the wigner distributions in the single - particle phase space @xcite , and hence , by ( [ uwcorrespond ] ) for all semiclassical geometries .",
    "because of the coarse - graining , many different quantum states may have the same geometrical description .",
    "thus some geometries should be associated to an entropy , whose exponential counts the number of underlying states with the same geometric description . in this section",
    "we want to find a formula for the entropy of half - bps spacetimes and then use it to discuss the partition sum over these geometries . with this motivation we will construct the wigner distribution of the coherent state basis for half - bps states and coarse - grain that to find our formula for the entropy of half - bps semiclassical spacetimes .      the semiclassical limit of half - bps states in yang - mills theory is most conveniently studied in terms of coherent states ( [ eq : coherent ] ) , rather than the energy eigenstates described above .",
    "each of the @xmath4 fermions in the harmonic potential can be placed separately in a coherent state , with the fermionic statistics imposed by a slater determinant .",
    "consider an @xmath4-particle ( unnormalized ) wavefunction given by antisymmetrizing 1-particle wavefunctions @xmath139 , @xmath140 : @xmath141 = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in s_n } ( -)^\\sigma \\prod_i^n     \\psi_{\\sigma(i)}(x_i ) \\label{slater}.\\ ] ] the 1-particle - reduced density matrix of this state is @xmath142 in terms of the quantities @xmath143 the wigner phase space distribution of @xmath120 is given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 .",
    "finally , if we define the overlap matrix @xmath146 then the 1-particle reduced density matrix takes the simple form @xmath147 where @xmath148 goes over @xmath149 subject to @xmath150 .",
    "we are interested in the case where each @xmath151 is a coherent state , namely @xmath152 .",
    "then , applying equations ( [ overlap]-[cohdefrho2 ] ) , we get : @xmath153 with @xmath154 according to the semiclassical holographic map ( [ wignercoh ] ) is identified with the function @xmath13 in spacetime as in ( [ uwcorrespond ] ) .    in the semiclassical limit , the phase space distribution of fermions can be described as a droplet or set of droplets in the phase plane .",
    "coherent states were constructed to be minimum uncertainty droplets .",
    "they occupy an area of @xmath155 , the smallest possible quantum of phase space .",
    "this agrees with ( [ ndef ] ) and can be verified by close packing coherent states to form a fermi sea . in our conventions , @xmath4 closely packed coherent states form a fermi sea of area @xmath156 , covered with a wigner distribution which fluctuates around a mean value @xmath157 , consistent with ( [ uwcorrespond ] ) . in a similar way",
    "a length @xmath158 is a minimal allowed separation between coherent states .",
    "attempts to force the states closer than this distance cause them to delocalize into rings as illustrated in the example in fig .  2 .",
    "the observations above lead to the conclusion that for a semiclassical observer , it makes sense to think of states as inhabiting a lattice of unit cell area @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "in fact a semiclassical observer measures the phase plane at an area scale @xmath159 . at this scale ,",
    "the observer is only sensitive to a smooth , coarse grained wigner distribution @xmath160 which erases many details of the precise underlying precise microstates .",
    "it lies between 0 and @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "] we may view the region @xmath162 as consisting of @xmath163 lattice sites , a fraction @xmath164 of which are occupied by coherent states .",
    "then the entropy of the local region @xmath165 is @xmath166 the stirling approximation used in ( [ localent ] ) is valid when @xmath167 is reasonably far from 0 and 1 . for the total entropy this gives @xmath168 it is beautiful that thinking about @xmath164 as the probability of occupation of a site by a coherent state ,",
    "this is simply shannon s formula for information in a probability distribution .",
    "these facts imply that in the semiclassical limit the function @xmath59 which completely defines a classical solution should effectively be defined on a lattice with each plaquette of area @xmath169 , and take values of 0 or 1 in each site .",
    "likewise ( [ entropyequation ] ) will be interpreted as an expression for the entropy of arbitrary half - bps asymptotically @xmath170 spacetimes . as an example it exactly reproduces the formula for the entropy of the typical states described in @xcite that correspond in spacetime to the `` superstar '' geometry @xcite .",
    "note that the entropy vanishes if and only if @xmath13 equals @xmath129 or @xmath130 everywhere . following the correspondence ( [ uwcorrespond ] )",
    "such states map into geometries that are non - singular .",
    "we learn that semiclassical half - bps geometries that are smooth all have vanishing entropy ; and the presence of singularities @xmath171 also implies that the spacetime carries an entropy .",
    "thus , in this setting , entropy is a measure of ignorance of a part of the underlying state which is captured in classical gravity as a spacetime singularity .      in the semiclassical limit",
    "the partition function over the half - bps sector of iib string theory ( @xmath172 ) with asymptotically @xmath0 boundary conditions can be written as @xmath173 we are able to write this as a functional integral over just @xmath13 because the entire classical solution can be derived from this function , as can the hamiltonian @xmath174 and the number of units of 5-form flux @xmath4 .",
    "the measure @xmath175 reflects not only the jacobian in transforming between the supergravity fields and @xmath13 , but also the number of underlying microscopic configurations that give rise to the same macroscopic spacetime . to derive the semiclassical measure @xmath176",
    "recall first that the classical metric is a useful concept at scales @xmath177 and the semiclassical limit can be defined as ( [ semilimit ] ) . in this limit",
    "the smooth function @xmath59 arises by considering the limit of piecewise constant functions in the lattice of scale @xmath123 . to derive the continuum measure @xmath175",
    "we first ask how many microscopic configurations can give rise to a given average value of @xmath13 in each @xmath178 lattice cell . from the previous section",
    "we have learned that we can think of @xmath13 as the average number of planck size cells that are populated by coherent states within an area of size @xmath178 .",
    "following ( [ localent ] ) this means that a coarse - grained plaquette of size @xmath123 with a given value of @xmath13 arises from @xmath179 underlying configurations .",
    "many of these configurations , representing different occupation numbers of planck cells , will have different energies because the energy contribution of a given planck cell depends upon its location as @xmath180 ( [ hdef ] ) .",
    "however , because @xmath181 in the semiclassical limit , configurations that populate a fixed fraction of planck sized cells will necessarily have very similar energies .",
    "in fact it can be shown that the energies are even similar in planck units in the strict semiclassical limit ( [ semilimit ] ) .",
    "this is because as @xmath182 , the number of planck cells in each plaquette is extremely large .",
    "one can use this to show that the energies of configurations that populate a fixed fraction @xmath13 of the planck cells have a standard deviation to mean ratio that vanishes as @xmath182 . putting everything together , the measure on semiclassical half - bps spacetimes",
    "is @xmath183 where @xmath184 is understood as the entropy of the spacetime . in the semiclassical limit",
    ", a spacetime is nonsingular if @xmath185 everywhere . in that case ,",
    "@xmath186 and the measure @xmath176 is 1 .",
    "in other words , semiclassical half - bps spacetimes have an entropy if and only if they are singular .",
    "defining @xmath187 the partition function over semiclassical half - bps spacetimes becomes @xmath188 } \\ ] ] evaluating this by the method of saddlepoints gives @xmath189 where @xmath190 and @xmath191 is a fermi - dirac function .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that we have summed over both singular and non - singular semiclassical spacetimes , but have included the correct degeneracy factor ( [ measure ] ) .",
    "a naive approach to summing over geometries would have failed to include this measure because there is no semiclassical horizon giving arise to a bekenstein - hawking entropy . in such a a naive approach the partition function",
    "would have been @xmath192 this integral diverges at the upper limit .",
    "a naive approach taking the unit measure over geometries would only reproduce ( [ partfn ] ) if we restricted the partition sum to be over smooth geometries ( @xmath185 ) with @xmath13 taking constant values within elementary cells at the planck scale .",
    "this would mimic in geometry the coherent state analysis given above , but its validity is more doubtful because at the planck scale the wavefunction over geometries is always relevant .    the semiclassical partition function should reproduce the partition function obtained from first principles by coarse - graining the scale of the fundamental cells in the quantum mechanical phase space .",
    "this procedure is not ambiguous because the free fermion gauge theory description provides us with an honest quantum mechanical phase space .",

    "<S> most quantum states have wavefunctions that are widely spread over the accessible hilbert space and hence do not have a good description in terms of a single classical geometry . in order to understand when geometric descriptions are possible , we exploit the ads / cft correspondence in the half - bps sector of asymptotically @xmath0 universes . in this sector </S>",
    "<S> we devise a  coarse - grained metric operator \" whose eigenstates are well described by a single spacetime topology and geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we show that such half - bps universes have a non - vanishing entropy if and only if the metric is singular , and that the entropy arises from coarse - graining the geometry . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use our entropy formula to find the most entropic spacetimes with fixed asymptotic moments beyond the global charges . </S>"
