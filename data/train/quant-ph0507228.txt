    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in the investigation of the dispersion forces which originate from the existence of zero - point electromagnetic oscillations .",
    "the most well known physical phenomena of this kind are the van der waals and casimir forces ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "both forces are of the same nature and are related to nonrelativistic and relativistic situation , respectively . in the last few years",
    "many measurements of the casimir force between metals were performed @xcite .",
    "the increasing interest in experimental research of dispersion forces is motivated by their role in nanotechnology @xcite and for constraining predictions of modern theories of fundamental interactions @xcite ( see also ref .  @xcite covering both the experimental and theoretical developments on the subject ) . quite recently",
    "both the van der waals and casimir forces were shown to be important @xcite in experiments on quantum reflection and bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the theoretical description of the casimir force between real metals at nonzero temperature is problematic .",
    "the direct application @xcite of the lifshitz formula @xcite in combination with the dielectric function of the drude model leads @xcite to a violation of nernst s heat theorem in the case of perfect crystals , i.e. , to a nonzero value of the casimir entropy at zero temperature depending on the separation distance between the plates . as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , for crystals with defects or impurities nernst s heat theorem is satisfied , so that the entropy of a fluctuating field is equal to zero at zero temperature .",
    "this , however , does not solve the problem since a perfect crystal is a truly equilibrium system with non - degenerate dynamic state of lowest energy .",
    "according to quantum statistical physics , the nernst heat theorem is valid for any system possessing this property .",
    "it follows that any formalism applied to a perfect crystal must satisfy the nernst heat theorem , whereas the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite does not .",
    "it is notable that this approach predicts _ large _ thermal corrections to the casimir force at short separations as compared with the case of ideal metals .",
    "other theoretical descriptions of the thermal casimir force between real metals are based on the use of the lifshitz formula combined with the plasma model dielectric function @xcite or with the leontovich surface impedance @xcite . in the framework of these approaches",
    "the nernst heat theorem is satisfied for both perfect lattice as well as lattice with some small concentration of impurities .",
    "they predict _ small _ thermal corrections to the casimir force at short separations in qualitative agreement with the case of ideal metals .",
    "recent experiments reveal the possibility to test the validity of different theoretical approaches to the thermal casimir force .",
    "thus , the first modern measurement of the casimir force by means of a torsion pendulum @xcite was found @xcite to be in disagreement with refs .",
    "@xcite and consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite . the most precise and accurate modern experiment by means of a micromechanical torsional oscillator @xcite excludes the theoretical approach of refs .",
    "@xcite at 99% confidence and is consistent with the theoretical approaches of refs .",
    "notice that these conclusions concerning the comparison between theory and experiment are not universally accepted ( see the discussion on this subject in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    a distinguishing feature of the theoretical approach of refs .",
    "@xcite is the nonmonotonous dependence of the casimir pressure and the free energy of a fluctuating field on the temperature .",
    "there are some temperature intervals where the magnitudes of the casimir pressure and the free energy decrease with the increase of temperature . as a result",
    ", there are temperature intervals where the entropy of the fluctuating field takes negative values .",
    "the same is valid for hypothetical ( nonexistent ) dielectrics with a frequency - independent dielectric permittivity @xmath1 or higher @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in the approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite for metals and also for some real dielectrics considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the magnitudes of the casimir free energy and pressure increase with temperature .",

    "@xcite , the magnitudes of the casimir - polder free energy and force for the case of an atom interacting with a metal wall may decrease within some temperature region .",
    "the respective entropy of the fluctuating field becomes negative .",
    "when taken into account that the lifshitz formula for an atom near a metal wall is obtained @xcite from the case of a rarefied dielectric wall spaced parallel to a metal wall , it may be supposed that the primary reasons for the nonmonotonous behavior of the free energy are inherent in the casimir interaction between metal and dielectric .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the casimir pressure , free energy and entropy in a configuration of two thick parallel plates , one being metallic and the other dielectric .",
    "previously , only two metallic or two dielectric plates were considered in the retarded regime ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite where a so - called `` unusual pair of plates '' was treated ",
    "one of which is made of an ideal metal and the other is infinitely permeable ) . in the nonretarded limit of the van der waals",
    "force the hamaker constants for the configuration of a metallic and a dielectric plate were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the basis of the lifshitz formula we find the analytic expressions for the casimir pressure , free energy and entropy in the configuration of a plate made of ideal metal and a parallel plate made of dilute dielectric separated by a gap of thickness @xmath2 .",
    "it is shown that there are intervals on the temperature axis where the magnitude of the casimir pressure decreases with the increase of temperature , whereas the magnitude of the free energy increases with the temperature and the casimir entropy is positive .",
    "the asymptotic expressions of the obtained exact formulas at both low and high temperatures are presented and the validity of the nernst heat theorem is demonstrated .",
    "the possibility of a decreasing casimir energy and of negative values of the entropy of a fluctuating field within some temperature intervals is demonstrated for the cases of ideal and real ( au ) metals near dielectrics with arbitrary constant @xmath3 ( not dilute ) and real dielectrics with the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities ( si , @xmath4 ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of that negativeness of entropy is discussed . from this",
    "we give a positive answer to the above question of whether the entropy of a fluctuating field in the casimir regime can be negative .",

    "for au the available tabulated data are extended for lower frequencies using the usual procedure ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the resulting behavior of @xmath117 as a function of @xmath118 can be found in refs .",
    "the same procedure , applied in the case of si ( here the tabulated data for lower frequencies , than for au , are available so that no additional extension of data is needed ) , leads to the results shown by line 1 in fig .",
    "there are also good analytic formulas describing the behavior of the dielectric permittivities of different materials along the imaginary frequency axis . as an example , the dielectric permittivity of @xmath0 is well described @xcite in the ninham - parsegian representation @xcite @xmath119 where @xmath120rad / s , @xmath121rad / s are the characteristic absorption frequencies , and @xmath122 , @xmath123 are the corresponding absorption strengths in the infrared and ultraviolet ranges , respectively .",
    "the dielectric permittivity of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath118 is plotted in fig .  4 ,",
    "line 2 . as is seen from fig .  4 , the dielectric permittivities of si and @xmath0 are qualitatively different in the region of characteristic frequencies @xmath124rad / s .",
    "in fact , for @xmath0 in the region around @xmath125 the values of @xmath69 correspond to the second step of line 2 and are several times less than @xmath126 , whereas for si the static value of the dielectric permittivity @xmath127 is preserved up to the region of characteristic frequencies .",
    "it should be stressed that the computations below are unaffected by the controvercies concerning the contribution of the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula in the case of real metals ( this contribution is different in the approaches using the drude dielectric function and the leontovich surface impedance , see introduction ) .",
    "the reason is that in our case only one plate is made of a real metal , whereas the other one is made of a dielectric . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , for dielectrics with finite @xmath128 it follows @xmath129 as a result , if one plate is made of a dielectric , the transverse electric mode at zero frequency does not contribute to the casimir free energy regardless of the approach used to describe the metal of the other plate [ i.e. , regardless of the value of the transverse reflection coefficient @xmath130 .",
    "a further distinctive feature of the different approaches to the thermal casimir force in the case of real metal , which might play a part in determining the contribution to the free energy at nonzero matsubara frequencies , is the form of reflection coefficients . in the framework of the impedance approach @xcite , in place of the usual reflection coefficients ( [ eq2 ] ) ,",
    "expressed in terms of the dielectric permittivity , one should use the coefficients , expressed in terms of the leontovich surface impedance .",
    "this , however , does not present a problem because , as was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , at all nonzero matsubara frequencies the contributions from both types of the reflection coefficients are practically the same .    in fig .",
    "5 we present the results of the calculation for the relative thermal correction to the casimir energy between au and si plates obtained by eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) using the procedure described above at @xmath80k ( solid line ) . for comparison , in the same figure",
    "the dashed line shows the results obtained using the approach of sec .",
    "iii ( i.e. , for ideal metal and the dielectric with a frequency - independent dielectric permittivity @xmath127 equal to the static permittivity of si ) . as is seen from fig .  5 ( solid line )",
    ", there is a wide separation interval @xmath131 m where the relative thermal correction to the casimir energy in the case of real materials is negative ( in terms of the dimensionless variable this holds for @xmath132 ) .",
    "the minimum value of the thermal correction @xmath133 is achieved at @xmath134 m ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "what this means is that the casimir entropy in the case of real materials is negative within the separation region @xmath136 m ( or , in terms of @xmath18 , for @xmath137 ) .",
    "the comparison with the dashed line shows that for si the simple model , used in sec .",
    "iii , leads to the same qualitative results with only minor differences in the minimum values of @xmath138 and the width of the intervals where the thermal correction and the casimir entropy are negative .",
    "we now turn to the casimir interaction of au plate with a plate made of @xmath0 .",
    "as was discussed above , the behavior of the dielectric permittivity of @xmath0 along the imaginary frequency axis is different from that of si .",
    "the results of the calculation for the relative thermal correction to the casimir energy as a function of separation at @xmath80k , obtained by eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) , are shown in fig .  6 by the solid line .",
    "the dashed line is calculated for an ideal metal and a dielectric with the frequency - independent dielectric permittivity @xmath126 equal to the static dielectric permittivity of @xmath0 . as is seen from fig .",
    "6 , in this case the solid line presents the monotonously increasing positive function of the separation distance .",
    "the respective casimir entropy is also nonnegative within the separation region reflected in the figure .",
    "the application of the simplified model of sec .",
    "iii to @xmath0 leads to qualitatively different results shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "this line demonstrates the negative thermal correction within the separation region from @xmath139 m to @xmath140 m and the negative casimir entropy within the separations from 0.25 to @xmath141 m .",
    "thus , the use of realistic data for the dielectric permittivities of the plates is essential for the final results .",
    "in the foregoing we have investigated the thermal corrections to the casimir interaction between metallic and dielectric plates .",
    "this was done both analytically ( using the idealized model of an ideal metal and a dilute dielectric ) and numerically ( for the ideal metal and dielectric with a frequency independent dielectric permittivity , and for real metal and two different dielectrics with dissimilar behavior of their dielectric permittivities along the imaginary frequency axis ) .",
    "the main conclusion obtained above is that the pressure and the free energy of the casimir interaction between metal and dielectric plates may be a nonmonotonous functions of the temperature within some definite regions .",
    "this leads to the possibility of negative relative thermal corrections and negative values of entropy of the fluctuating field ( the latter holds only for dielectrics with sufficiently large dielectric permittivity ) . using the proximity force theorem",
    ", one can conclude that the relative thermal correction to the casimir force between a plane metal plate and a spherical dielectric lens ( the configuration used in many experiments ) also can be negative .",
    "the physical interpretation of the obtained results is based on the fact that both the free energy and entropy of the closed system under consideration consist of contributions from the plates and from their interaction ( in the previous sections the latter were denoted as @xmath142 , @xmath143 or as @xmath144 , @xmath145 for real materials ) .",
    "the above conclusions about the possibility of a nonmonotonous behavior of the free energy and of the negativeness of the entropy are relevant not for the closed system but due to the interaction between its parts . in the case of two plates made of an ideal metal with the dirichlet boundary conditions on their surface",
    ", there is no penetration of the fluctuating field inside the plates . in this case",
    "the characteristics of the closed system coincide with those obtained for the interaction between the plates . as a result , for ideal metals the free energy of a fluctuating field",
    "is a monotonous function and the entropy is positive . for two dielectric plates @xcite or for one dielectric and one metal plate",
    "this is not necessarily so .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that only the interaction parts of the free energy and entropy depend on a separation distance : @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "this leads to two conclusions of considerable significance .",
    "the first is that the thermal correction to the casimir force ( which is minus the derivative of the free energy with respect to the separation ) can be negative .",
    "the second is that the nernst heat theorem must be valid separately for the contribution to the entropy from the interaction between the plates , so that @xmath148 , and for the entropy of the plates . if this were not the case , i.e. , if the equation @xmath149 were valid ( like in refs .",
    "@xcite for perfect crystal with no impurities ) , then the nernst heat theorem for the closed system would be violated as the entropies of the plates do not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "both these conclusions were illustrated above by the example of the casimir interaction between metal and dielectric .",
    "to conclude , the nonmonotonous dependence of the casimir free energy on temperature and the negative values of the relative thermal correction ( as , for instance , was predicted for real metals in the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite and for si in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are not in themselves excluded thermodynamically .",
    "such behavior for real metals is , however , unlikely because there is only a small penetration of the electromagnetic fluctuations at the characteristic frequencies in the interior of a metal ( recall that in the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , where this property of real metals is taken into account , the free energy is monotonous , and the relative thermal correction is positive ) .",
    "the decisive theoretical argument to give preference to any approach is , thus , the fulfillment of the nernst heat theorem for the casimir entropy of a fluctuating field for both perfect crystals and crystals with impurities . in particular , if one interacting body is made of a metal and the other of a dielectric , the entropy of the fluctuating field vanishes when the temperature goes to zero .",
