    "since the pioneering paper @xcite , the so - called kdv limit of atomic chains with nearest neighbor interactions  often called fermi - pasta - ulam or fpu - type chains  has attracted a lot of interest in both the physics and the mathematics community , see @xcite for a recent overview .",
    "the key observation is that in the limiting case of long - wave - length data with small amplitudes the dynamics of the nonlinear lattice system is governed by the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation , which is a completely integrable pde and hence well understood . for rigorous results concerning initial value problems we refer to @xcite and to @xcite for similar result in chains with periodically varying masses .    of particular interest",
    "are the existence of kdv - like solitary waves and their stability with respect to the fpu dynamics .",
    "both problems have been investigated by friesecke and pego in the seminal four - paper series @xcite , see also @xcite for simplifications in the stability proof and @xcite concerning the existence of periodic kdv - type waves .",
    "the more general cases of two or finitely many solitary waves have been studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in this paper",
    "we generalize the existence result from @xcite and prove that chains with interactions between further than nearest - neighbors also admit kdv - type solitary waves .",
    "the corresponding stability problem is beyond the scope of this paper and left for future research .",
    "we consider an infinite chain of identical particles which interact with up to @xmath0 neighbors on both sides .",
    "assuming unit mass , the equations of motion are therefore given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the position of particle @xmath3 at time @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the potential @xmath5 describes the interactions between nearest - neighbors , @xmath6 between the next - to - nearest - neighbors , and so on .",
    "a traveling wave is an exact solution to which satisfies @xmath7 where the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the prescribed background strain and background velocity , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 is an additional scaling parameter which will be identified below and becomes small in the kdv limit .",
    "a direct computation reveals that the wave speed @xmath11 as well as the rescaled wave profile @xmath12 must solve the rescaled traveling wave equation @xmath13 where the discrete differential operators are defined by @xmath14 note that @xmath9 does not appear in due to the galilean invariance of the problem and that the solution set is invariant under the addition of constants to @xmath12 .",
    "it is therefore natural to interpret as an equation for the rescaled velocity profile @xmath15 ; the corresponding distance or strain profile @xmath16 can then be computed by convoluting @xmath17 with the rescaled indicator function of an interval , see formula below .    for @xmath18 and",
    "fixed @xmath10 there exist  depending on the properties of @xmath5  many different types of traveling waves with periodic , homoclinic , heteroclinic , or even more complex shape of the profile @xmath17 , see for instance @xcite and references therein . in the limit @xmath19 , however , the most fundamental waves are periodic and solitary waves , for which @xmath17 is either periodic or decays to @xmath20 as @xmath21 .    in this paper",
    "we suppose @xmath22  this condition can always be ensured by elementary transformations  and split off both the linear and the quadratic terms from the force functions @xmath23 .",
    "this reads @xmath24 or , equivalently , @xmath25 with @xmath26 . in order to keep the presentation as simple as possible",
    ", we restrict our considerations to solitary waves  the case of periodic profiles can be studied along the same lines  and rely on the following standing assumption .",

    "moreover , @xmath30 is continuously differentiable with @xmath31 and @xmath32 for some constants @xmath33 and all @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "note that the usual requirements for @xmath18 are @xmath36 and @xmath37 but the case @xmath38 can be traced back to the case @xmath39 by a simple reflection argument with respect to the strain variable @xmath34 .",
    "below we discuss possible generalizations of assumption [ mainassumption ] including cases in which the coefficients come with different signs .",
    "the overall strategy for proving the existence of kdv - type solitary waves in the lattice system is similar to the approach in @xcite but many aspects are different due to the nonlocal coupling .",
    "in particular , we base our analysis on the velocity profile @xmath40 instead of the distance profile @xmath41 , deviate in the justification of the key asymptotic estimates , and solve the final nonlinear corrector problem by the banach fixed - point theorem .",
    "a more detailed comparison is given throughout the paper .",
    "as for the classical case @xmath18 , we prescribe a wave speed @xmath11 that is slightly larger than the sound speed @xmath42 and construct profile functions that satisfy and decay for @xmath21 .",
    "more precisely , we set @xmath43 i.e. , the small parameter @xmath10 quantifies the supersonicity of the wave .",
    "note that the subsonic case @xmath44 is also interesting but not related to solitary waves , see discussions at the end of  [ sect : prelim ] and the end of  [ sect : proof ] .",
    "the asymptotic analysis from  [ sect : prelim ] reveals that the limiting problem as @xmath19 is the nonlinear ode @xmath45 where the positive constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 depend explicitly on the coefficient @xmath48 and @xmath49 , see formula below . this equation admits a homoclinic solution , which is unique up to shifts ( see  [ sect : proof.1 ] ) and provides via @xmath50 a solitary wave to the kdv equation @xmath51 for @xmath10 we start with the ansatz @xmath52 and derive in  [ sect : proof ] the fixed point equation @xmath53}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the corrector @xmath54 , where the operator @xmath55 is introduced in .",

    "the linear leading order operator @xmath57 stems from the linearization of around the kdv wave @xmath58 and can be inverted on the space @xmath59 but not on @xmath60 due to the shift invariance of the problem .",
    "the first technical issue in our perturbative existence proof is to show that this invertibility property persists for small @xmath10 , see theorem [ lem : invertibilityofleps ] .",
    "the second one is to guarantee that @xmath55 is contractive on some ball in @xmath59 , see theorem [ thm : fixedpoints ] .",
    "our main findings are illustrated in figure  [ fig0 ] and can be summarized as follows , see also corollary  [ cor : summary ] .    for any sufficiently small @xmath10",
    "there exists a unique even and nonnegative solution @xmath17 to the rescaled traveling wave equation with such that @xmath61 holds for some constant @xmath62 independent of @xmath63 , where @xmath58 is the unique even solution to .    the asymptotic analysis presented below can  for the price of more notational and technical effort",
    " be applied to a wider class of chains .",
    "specifically , we expect that the following generalizations are feasible :    1 .   we can allow for @xmath64 provided that the coefficients @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath33 decay sufficiently fast with respect to @xmath65 ( say , exponentially ) .",
    "2 .   some of the coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath49 might even be negative . in this case",
    ", however , one has to ensure that the contributions from the negative coefficients are compensated by those from the positive ones .",
    "a first natural condition is @xmath66 which ensures that uniform states are stable under small amplitude perturbations and that the sound speed @xmath42 from is positive .",
    "a further minimal requirement is @xmath67 because otherwise the leading order problem  see and below  degenerates and does not admit exponentially decaying homoclinic orbits .",
    "the non - quadratic contributions to the forces might be less regular in the sense of @xmath68 for some constants @xmath33 and exponents @xmath69 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sect : prelim ] we introduce a family of convolution operators and reformulate as an eigenvalue problem for @xmath17 .",
    "afterwards we provide singular asymptotic expansions for a linear auxiliary operator @xmath70 , which is defined in and plays a prominent role in our method .",
    " [ sect : proof ] is devoted to the proof of the existence theorem .",
