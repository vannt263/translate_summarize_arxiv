    "synchronization is an important dynamical process in many systems .",
    "understanding and controlling this collective dynamics is of both theoretical and practical significance  @xcite .",
    "many methods have been proposed to enhance the network synchronizability , including the redistribution of the coupling strengths  @xcite , the modification of the network structure  @xcite , the flipping of link directionality  @xcite , and so on .",
    "each group of methods has its specific range of applications since different systems are under different technical constrains .",
    "as real systems are frequently manipulated by growing out new connections and eliminating redundant connections  @xcite , we here focus on the link reconstructing method to enhance synchronizability .",
    "the word  reconstructing \" stands for manipulations including adding , removing and rewiring links , and in each manipulation only one link is created or changed . the reconstructing method for undirected networks",
    "has already been studied by using the information embedded in laplacian eigenvectors  @xcite .",
    "however , the spectral method can not be directly applied to directed networks , since the complex value emerges in eigenvectors when the laplacian matrix is asymmetry . up to now",
    ", how reconstructing methods affect the synchronization on directed networks lacks of systematic consideration .",
    "previous works show that there are two important factors that mainly affect the synchronization on directed networks : the in - degree distribution  @xcite and the hierarchical structure  @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , the more homogeneous the in - degree distribution in a directed network is , the stronger the network synchronizability is .",
    "the synchronizability in directed networks can be approximately expressed by @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a smaller @xmath1 indicates a better synchronizability .",
    "accordingly , to enhance synchronizability in directed networks , we can either decrease @xmath2 or increase @xmath3 which are respectively corresponding to removing the links that point to the nodes with maximum in - degree or adding links that point to the nodes with minimum in - degree . besides the in - degree distribution which plays the dominant role in determining the synchronizability of directed networks , the hierarchical structure may also have considerable effects  @xcite .",
    "if the reconstructing strategy only aims at the homogeneous in - degree distribution , an effective hierarchical structure can not be formed and the resultant synchronizability may fall into local optimum . therefore , how to choose the starting points of the adding and removing links is very important which may affect the overall hierarchical structure , and thus further affects the synchronizability . in this paper",
    ", we employ the pagerank algorithm  @xcite to characterize the centralities of nodes on directed networks and design a _ centrality - based reconstructing _ ( cbr ) method to enhance synchronizability accordingly .",
    "generally , the information of the hidden hierarchical structure is embedded in the node centrality gradient  @xcite .",
    "the nodes with high pagerank scores are more likely to be at the high layer of the network , while those with low pagerank scores probably locate at the low layer .",
    "the basic idea of the cbr method is that the newly added links should start from high - layer nodes ( with high pagerank scores ) , while we should choose the links starting form the low - layer nodes ( with low pagerank scores ) to remove .",
    "performing the linear stability analysis of synchronizability  @xcite in directed networks , we find that the cbr method is more effective in facilitating synchronization than the _ degree - based reconstructing _",
    "( dbr ) method and _ random reconstructing _ ( rr ) method .",
    "furthermore , we apply the cbr method to links rewiring procedure . at each step",
    "we first remove one link from the network and then add a new one according to the removing and adding strategies of the cbr method .",
    "after several steps , we find that the resulted networks are very close to the optimal structure from the evolutionary optimization algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations on the kuramoto model  @xcite further demonstrate that our method has advantage in shortening the convergence time to synchronization on directed networks .",
    "consider a directed and unweighted network with @xmath4 nodes and @xmath5 links .",
    "denote by @xmath6 the adjacency matrix where the element @xmath7 if there is a directed link from node @xmath8 to node @xmath9 , otherwise 0 .",
    "specifically , @xmath8 is the start and @xmath9 is the end .",
    "the average degree of the network is @xmath10 . in the synchronization process",
    ", each node stands for an oscillator and each directed link represents the influence from one oscillator to another .",
    "the synchronization in directed networks is actually formed by a top - down centralized control mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the oscillators with higher dynamic centrality are supposed to be more influential in driving the whole system to synchronize . in directed networks",
    ", there are many different ways to measure the node s centrality  @xcite .",
    "one of the prominent group of methods is based on the random walk process , such as pagerank  @xcite , hits  @xcite and leaderrank  @xcite algorithms . in this paper",
    ", we apply the well - known pagerank algorithm to quantify the node s centrality in directed network .    pagerank is a famous ranking algorithm which forms the basis of @xmath11 search engine  @xcite .",
    "it has been applied to rank scientists in citation networks  @xcite and detect community structure in directed networks  @xcite . in practice",
    ", pagerank assigns a score @xmath12 to denote the attractiveness of the webpage @xmath8 .",
    "webpage @xmath8 obtains higher score if many other important webpages point to it . from the physical perspective",
    ", pagerank describes a random walk process on directed network , where the score @xmath12 is proportional to the frequency of visits to a particular node @xmath8 by a random walker . in pagerank algorithm , a parameter @xmath13 , called _ return probability _ ,",
    "is introduced , which represents the probability for a random walker to jump to a random node , and @xmath14 is the probability for the random walker to continue walking through the directed links .",
    "note that , in the oscillator network the link from node @xmath8 to node @xmath9 indicates that node @xmath8 has influence on node @xmath9 , and the nodes who has larger influence on other nodes are more important for the network synchronization .",
    "therefore , in our case the random walker should follow the opposite direction of links . in this way , the node @xmath8 s centrality score at time @xmath15 ( @xmath16 )",
    "is given by @xmath17s_{j}(t-1),\\label{pr}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 when @xmath19 and @xmath20 otherwise .",
    "initially , we assign each node one random walker , namely @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "the typical value of return probability is about 0.15  @xcite .",
    "the final score of each node is defined as the steady value after the convergence of @xmath23 .",
    "generally speaking , the hierarchical structure of a directed network can be embodied by the node s centrality measured by eq .",
    "( [ pr ] )  @xcite .",
    "a node with higher score is inclined to locate at the high layer of the network hierarchy . with this in mind , we propose a centrality - based reconstructing ( cbr ) method to enhance the synchronizability on directed networks by manipulating a fixed number of links . since the network synchronizability can be characterized by the indicator @xmath24 : the smaller @xmath1 , the higher synchronizability .",
    "therefore , we have two ways to enhance synchronizability : increasing @xmath3 by adding links pointing to the nodes with minimum in - degree and decreasing @xmath2 by removing links pointing to the nodes with maximum in - degree . the starting nodes for adding and removing links",
    "are selected according to the nodes centrality scores given by eq .",
    "( [ pr ] ) . to add a link",
    ", we choose node @xmath8 with minimum in - degree as the end , and node @xmath9 with maximum centrality among all the nodes having not yet pointed to @xmath8 as the start . to remove a link , we firstly guarantee the end is of maximum in - degree , and then among all possible candidates of starts , we choose the one with minimum centrality . this strategy will help to generate more _ receptors _ , namely the nodes without any outgoing link , which is a favorable structure for synchronization . for details , one can see the discussion in sec .",
    "iii b. note that , after adding or removing a link the centrality score of each node will be recalculated .",
    "we consider two other methods for comparison : the random reconstructing ( rr ) method and the degree - based reconstructing ( dbr ) method .",
    "the strategies of choosing the ends of these two methods are the same as cbr , namely adding new link pointing to the node with minimum in - degree and removing link that points to the node with maximum in - degree .",
    "the difference is how to choose the starts . when adding or removing links by the rr method , the start of the links are randomly selected . for dbr method ,",
    "when adding a link , the node with maximum out - degree and not yet pointing to the end will be chosen as the start , while when removing a link , the link starting with a node of minimum out - degree is removed . in the following section , we will compare cbr method with rr and dbr methods on three directed network models based on the linear stability analysis of synchronizability and the numerical simulation on the kuramoto model .",

    "every eigenvalue should be entirely contained in the region of negative lyapunov exponent for the particular master stability function .",

    "1 . generally speaking , cbr performs best among all three methods .",
    "specifically , in directed regular networks [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] all these three methods can decrease @xmath1 by adding links .",
    "the enhancement of synchronizability results from the decreasing of the average shortest distance of networks .",
    "as we know , networks with small average shortest distance are likely to have better synchronizability  @xcite .",
    "besides , the dbr method and cbr method outperform the rr method especially when many links are added .",
    "the reason is that the dbr method and cbr method are capable to generate a network core during the adding process , which may involve one ( when adding a small number of links ) or several ( when adding many links ) nodes .",
    "the core node has many outgoing links and drives other nodes during the synchronizing process .",
    "it has been pointed out that such a core is favorable for the network synchronizability  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the rr method is unable to induce such an effective core , thus its synchronizability enhancement is only from the decreasing of the average shortest distance .",
    "two typical examples are shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) and fig .",
    "2(b ) which are obtained by adding @xmath45 links to a directed regular networks with rr and cbr methods , respectively .",
    "clearly , there exists a center node as the core of the obtained cbr network , yet there is no observable central nodes for the obtained rr network .",
    "figure  [ fig1](b ) shows that the indicator @xmath1 decreases with the increasing number of added links for all these three methods and the difference between them is very small ( @xmath46,@xmath47,@xmath48 ) .",
    "the enhancement mainly comes from narrowing the in - degree distribution . for the directed ws networks , even though the cbr and dbr methods can still form a core by adding a few links , the positive effect of the core is disrupted by the complicated structure of the initial network .",
    "therefore , when adding a few links , like 50 , comparing with rr method the synchronizability enhancements by cbr and dbr methods are very limited , respectively 4.9% and 2.0% . note that , when we add more links , like 500 , the improvements increase to 12.3% and 9.7% for the cbr and dbr methods ( @xmath49,@xmath50,@xmath51 ) , respectively , since the effect of the initial network will be depressed .",
    "additionally , the cbr and dbr methods can lead to shorter convergence time than the rr method due to the smaller core - distance ( see details in sec .",
    "iii d for kuramoto model ) . given a network ,",
    "the core - distance is defined as the average shortest distance from the core node to all other nodes in this network .",
    "it was pointed out that the smaller the core - distance , the quicker the whole network converges to synchronization , since the core actually drives the whole network to the synchronized state  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the core - distance on the number of added links in the directed ws networks is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "note that , since there is no core in rr network , we use the minimal distance from a node to all other nodes in the network ( such node is considered as a core ) .",
    "clearly , the values of the core - distance of the cbr and dbr methods are much smaller than that of rr , and thus the cbr and dbr methods can result in shorter convergence time .    in directed ba models , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) it is clear that cbr method performs best .",
    "the directed ba model has obvious hierarchical structure where the nodes with higher centrality scores incline to locate at the higher layer . in cbr method , the start of the new link is chosen as the node with maximum centrality score , thus the generated core is actually the root node ( in the highest layer ) of the initial directed ba networks .",
    "in contrast , with dbr method the core nodes usually locate in low layers . with starts in low layers",
    "many inverse links ( i.e. , links from low layers to high layers ) will be formed , leading to a large number of loops .",

    "however , cbr method can generate lots of receptors ( i.e. , the nodes without any outgoing link ) who are only affected by other nodes .",
    "this structure is favorable for synchronization since these receptors do not send back interruptive information to their upstream nodes .",
    "when removing the first link from the regular network , since the out - degree and the centrality score for all the nodes are the same , it is equivalent to a random selection of one link .",

    "however , it can be seen that the order parameter of cbr networks is higher than the rr and dbr networks , in accordance with the higher synchronizability predicted by the master stability analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig5](d ) shows that the networks from the cbr and dbr methods converge faster than the ones from the rr method .",
    "it is because rr is more likely to remove long range links , resulting in an increasing of the average distance of the network , which usually corresponds to a longer convergence time .",
    "in contrast , in the directed ws networks , the starts of the long range links usually have relatively large out - degrees and high pagerank scores , and therefore are not likely to be removed according to the cbr or dbr methods .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](f ) , the cbr method leads to the smallest convergence time among the three methods .",
    "as the pagerank centrality score can help the cbr method to recognize the hierarchical structure of the directed ba model , the final spanning trees of the cbr method are always with fewer depth than the dbr and rr methods [ see also fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) ] resulting in the faster convergence .",
    "in summary , we proposed a centrality - based reconstructing ( cbr ) method to facilitate synchronization in directed networks . the centrality is measured by the pagerank algorithm . numerical analysis on three network models",
    "shows that the cbr method is more effective in enhancing the network synchronizability than the degree - based reconstructing method and random reconstructing method . specifically , when adding links , the cbr method forms a wisely located core to drive the whole network to the synchronized state .",
    "when removing links , the cbr method generates lots of receptors which only receive information and do not disturb the upstream nodes .",
    "furthermore , the cbr method can also be extended to deal with the link rewiring problem .",
    "significantly , the obtained network through cbr link rewiring method has very close synchronizability to the corresponding optimal case obtained by the evolutionary optimization algorithm .",
    "finally , the result from the kuramoto model shows that the cbr method has advantage in shortening the convergence time to synchronization .    in practice ,",
    "as real systems are frequently manipulated by growing new connections and eliminating redundant connections  @xcite , the cbr method can provide a useful way to improve synchronizability . in some specific systems like ecosystems  @xcite and neuron systems  @xcite ,",
    "synchronization should be inhibited .",
    "in such situation , the inverted cbr method can be applied to decrease the synchronizability , namely to add links starting from the nodes with low centrality scores to the nodes with high in - degrees and to remove the links whose starts have high centrality scores while whose ends own low in - degrees .",
