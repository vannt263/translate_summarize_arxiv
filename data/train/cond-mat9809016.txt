    "pb and sn @xmath4 adlayer structures on the ( 111 ) surface of ge have recently revealed a reversible charge density wave ( cdw ) transition to a low temperature reconstructed @xmath3 phase .",
    "@xcite a half - filled surface state band makes the high temperature phase metallic .",
    "the low temperature phase is either metallic  as seems to be the case for sn / ge(111 )  or weakly gapped , or pseudo - gapped , as suggested for pb / ge(111 ) .",
    "related isoelectronic systems , like the @xmath5-adlayer of si on the ( 0001 ) surface of sic @xcite and on k / si(111):b,@xcite show a clear insulating behavior , with a large gap , no structural anomalies , no cdws , and no transitions , at least to our present knowledge .",
    "these adsorbate surfaces are altogether mysterious .",
    "the very existence of a @xmath4 adsorbate phase , with coverage 1/3 , is puzzling . for isoelectronic si on si(111 ) , or ge on ge(111 ) ,",
    "for instance , there exists no such phase . the stable low - coverage phase",
    "are @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , whose coverage is instead close to 1/4 .",
    "they are made up of @xmath8 basic building blocks , each with one adatom saturating three out of four first - layer atoms , and one unsaturated first - layer atom , the `` restatom '' . in this adatom - restatom block , the nominally unpaired electron of the adatom and that of the restatom pair off together , giving rise to a stable , fully saturated , insulating surface . by contrast , the @xmath4 phases with 1/3 coverage are very common for trivalent adsorbates , such as ga and in , and for pentavalent ones like as , on the same ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "these adatoms lack the unpaired electron , and can therefore lead to a fully saturated insulating surface without the need for any restatoms .    a @xmath4 adsorbate phase of _ tetravalent _ adatoms is bound by construction to possess one unpaired electron per adatom , giving rise to a very destabilizing half - filled metallic surface state band . seen in this crude light ,",
    "it is a puzzle why this kind of coverage should constitute even only a locally stable state of the surface .",
    "looking more closely , we may speculate that sic(0001)@xcite and k / si(111):b,@xcite most likely mott - hubbard insulators , @xcite are perhaps `` stabilized '' by coulomb repulsions , so large to make it anyway difficult for electrons to move .",
    "for the more innocent - looking , less correlated , pb / ge(111 ) and sn / ge(111 ) , this argument is less obvious , and the puzzle remains .",
    "the function of the @xmath3 cdw state ",
    "whatever its real nature ",
    "most likely serves the function of stabilizing these otherwise unstable surfaces at low temperatures .",
    "nonetheless , the cdw periodicity chosen by the surface cdw  @xmath3 , meaning a @xmath4 super - cell of adatoms  is not at all evident .",
    "in fact , it replaces a supposedly unstable state characterized by an odd number of electrons / cell ( three ) , with another where the electron number ( nine ) is , alas , odd again .",
    "be all that as it may , there is little doubt that the main factor driving the phenomena on all these surfaces , appears to be precisely the half - filled and extremely narrow  surface state band .",
    "we thus begin with a discussion that in principle encompasses all the @xmath4 tetravalent adsorbed surfaces .",
    "we believe the following points to be of general validity :    _ i ) _ * poor nesting*.    two - dimensional fermi surface ( fs ) nesting in the half - filled surface states@xcite has been repeatedly invoked as the driving mechanism for the cdw instability in the case of pb / ge,@xcite but excluded for the case of sn / ge.@xcite however , by inspecting either photoemission @xmath9 data , @xcite and existing first - principle ( lda ) calculations@xcite of the surface half - filled band ( the``adatom dangling bond band '' ) , we fail to detect a particularly good nesting of the two - dimensional fs at the surface brillouin zone ( bz ) corner @xmath10 . the wavevector - dependent susceptibility generated by the calculated band structure , in particular , has no especially large value at this k - point , and rather peaks elsewhere ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ band_bz_chi0:fig ] ) . to be sure",
    ", there is nothing preventing in general a good nesting at @xmath10 , or any other k - point .",
    "however , insofar as the surface state band is really lying in a bulk gap at each single k - point , it should be with good accuracy  by simple state counting and charge neutrality ",
    "precisely half filled .",
    "this implies that the filled and empty state areas should be equal .",
    "hypothetical fermi surfaces with this kind of shape and good nesting at @xmath10 do not appear to be compatible with an integer electron number .",
    "we thus believe lack of perfect nesting to be the case for both pb / ge as for sn / ge .",
    "[ band_bz_chi0:fig ] , showing a tight binding fit to the lda surface band dispersion for the test - case of si(111)/si,@xcite as well as the corresponding fs and lindhard density response function @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the occupation number and energy of an electron with bloch momentum @xmath15 , provides a concrete illustration of these statements .",
    "we note , in passing , that a strong nesting at @xmath16 is , on the contrary , automatically guaranteed if the surface band acquires a uniform magnetization in such a way that the densities of up and down electrons become , respectively , @xmath17 and @xmath18.@xcite the majority spins would then fill the region external to the reduced bz in fig .",
    "[ band_bz_chi0:fig ] , and their fs would be strongly nested .",
    "this suggestion , which turns out to be correct at the mean - field level , points into the direction of a possible role played by magnetism in these systems .    _",
    "ii ) _ * importance of electron - electron interactions*.    the width @xmath19 of the surface band is relatively small : @xmath20 ev for pb and sn / ge(111 ) , @xmath21 ev for sic(0001 ) . moreover ,",
    "this band is half - filled .",
    "these facts call for a careful consideration of electron - electron interactions , as well as of electron - phonon ( e - ph ) , as possible sources of instability . the importance of electron - electron interaction is underlined by the different phenomenology of sic(0001 ) and k / si(111):b with respect to pb - sn / ge(111 ) . the stronger insulating character of the former surfaces parallels closely their stronger electron - electron repulsions , connected both with more localized surface wannier functions ( see later on ) , and with reduced screening , due to larger bulk semiconducting gaps .    _",
    "iii ) _ * weakness of lda calculations for ground state prediction*.    lda electronic structure calculations ",
    "an extremely well tested tool in many areas are certainly suitable for a weakly interacting system , such as the bulk semiconductor , or a passivated semiconductor surface .",
    "they are less reliable , especially when they do not include spin , in predicting the stable state and the instabilities of a narrow band system .",
    "for instance , the phenomenology of sic(0001 )  suggesting a mott - hubbard insulator  is unreproducible by lda .",
    "the onset of a cdw on sn / ge(111)is also not predicted by recent lda calculations.@xcite while there is no reason to doubt the basic credibility of the one - electron band energies obtained from these kohn - sham equations , the mean - field treatment of interactions , the screened local exchange , and especially the neglect of magnetic correlations are the standard source of problems with lda . as a consequence",
    ", it will be necessary to worry more substantially about interactions , and to use methods which , even if mean - field , permit the inclusion of strong correlations , including magnetic effects .    _",
    "iv ) _ * interaction - driven mechanisms for @xmath3 cdw instabilities*.    there are several different couplings which the surface electrons , as they hop weakly between a surface adatom site and another , experience and can influence the formation of the cdw , or of an insulating ground state : a ) on - site , and nearest - neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "inter - site electron - electron repulsion ; b ) on - site effective attraction ( negative hubbard-@xmath1 term ) of electron - phonon origin .",
    "because of poor nesting , electron - phonon alone is unlikely to drive the @xmath3 cdw . at weak coupling , the susceptibility peak in fig .",
    "[ band_bz_chi0:fig ] would rather drive an incommensurate periodicity . at strong coupling ,",
    "the frustration associated to the triangular lattice , will favor , in general , a superconducting ground state over a cdw phase ( see appendix).@xcite    on the other hand , the electron - electron interaction , both on - site and , independently , nearest neighbor , naturally suggests , as we shall see later , the @xmath3 surface periodicity , which is found experimentally .",
    "the approach we will take is based on an extended hubbard - holstein model .",
    "it is by necessity a `` non - first - principle '' approach and , as such , has no strong predictive power .",
    "however , it is made more realistic by using parameters extracted from first - principle calculations , and we find it very helpful in clarifying the possible scenarios as a function of the strength of electron - electron interactions . because of this rather qualitative use , we will make no attempt to push the accuracy of treatment of this model to a very high level of sophistication .",
    "the basic tool will be the unrestricted hartree - fock approximation . although mean field , it allows magnetic solutions , favored by exchange which is unscreened .",
    "each tetravalent adatom on a ( 111 ) semiconductor surface carries a dangling bond  an unpaired electron in an unsaturated orbital . in the @xmath22 structure , the dangling bonds of the adatoms give rise to a band of surface states which lies in the bulk semiconductor gap .",
    "@xcite by electron counting , such a band is half - filled .",
    "our basic starting point is the quantitatively accurate surface state band dispersion @xmath14 which one calculates in gradient - corrected lda , @xcite .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ band_bz_chi0:fig ] for the case of si / si(111 ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ band_bz_chi0:fig ] are tight - binding fits to the lda results obtained by including , respectively , up to the @xmath23 and up to the @xmath24 shell of neighbors .",
    "the fit with hopping integrals @xmath25 is quite good . less good , but qualitatively acceptable , is the fit obtained using only nearest neighbor ( n.n . ) and next - nearest neighbor ( n.n.n . ) hopping integrals @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the fermi surface ( fs ) for the half - filled surface band is shown in the upper inset of fig .",
    "[ band_bz_chi0:fig ] .",
    "it is important to stress that the fs does not show good nesting properties at the wavevector @xmath28 ( the bz corner ) .",
    "this feature is shared by all lda calculations on similar systems.@xcite albeit small , the bandwidth @xmath19 of the surface band is much greater than one would predict by a direct overlap of adatom dangling bonds , as the adatoms are very widely apart , for instance about @xmath29 on ge(111 ) .",
    "hopping is indirect , and takes place from the adatom to the first - layer atoms underneath , from that to a second - layer atom , then again to a first - layer atom underneath the other adatom , and from there finally to other adatom dangling bond .",
    "thus , when expressed in terms of elementary hopping processes between hybrid orbitals , electron hopping between two neighboring adatom dangling bonds is fifth order . as a result",
    ", the final dispersion of the surface state band strongly parallels that of the closest bulk band , the valence band . correspondingly , hybridization effects of the dangling bond orbitals with first , second , and even third , bulk layer orbitals are strong , as shown by the extension into the bulk of the wannier orbital associated to the lda surface band ( fig .",
    "[ wannier : fig ] ) .    in spite of this , we can still associate to every adatom a wannier orbital and write the effective hamiltonian for the surface band as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the fourier transform of the wannier orbital , namely the surface state in a bloch picture .",
    "the sum over the wavevectors runs over the surface bz .",
    "@xmath32 includes correlation effects which are not correctly accounted for within lda , which we parametrize as follows : @xmath33 here @xmath1 is an effective repulsion ( hubbard-@xmath1 ) for two electrons on the same adatom wannier orbital , and @xmath34 is the direct coulomb interaction between different sites @xmath35 and @xmath36.@xcite let @xmath2 be the n.n .",
    "value of @xmath34 , which is , clearly , the largest term .",
    "we have considered two models for @xmath34 : a model ( a ) in which we truncate @xmath34 to n.n . , and a model ( b ) in which @xmath34 has a long range coulombic tail of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the n.n .",
    "the results for model b are qualitatively similar to those of a , and will be only briefly discussed later on . in other words , even if most of the detailed results in this paper will be base on the n.n .",
    "@xmath34 , their validity is more general .",
    "lda estimates of the _ bare _ coulomb repulsion @xmath39 and @xmath40 between two electrons respectively on the same and on neighboring wannier orbitals are  for our test case of si(111)/si  of about @xmath41 ev and @xmath42 ev respectively.@xcite screening effects by the the underlying bulk are expected to reduce very substantially these repulsive energies .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate for @xmath1 and @xmath2 is obtained by dividing their bare values by the image - charge screening factor , @xmath43 , yielding , for si , @xmath44 ev ( @xmath45 ) , and @xmath46 ev ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "corresponding values would be somewhat smaller for ge(111 ) , in view of a very similar dispersion @xcite and of a ratio of about 4/3 between the dielectric constants of ge and si .",
    "sic(0001 ) , the opposite is true .",
    "the surface state band is extremely narrow , of order @xmath48 ev @xcite , while the bulk dielectric constant is only about @xmath49 .    as for the e - ph interaction , in principle both the on - site wannier state energy and the hopping matrix elements between neighbors depend on the positions of the adatoms . within the deformation potential approximation",

    "preliminary to the full treatment of sect .",
    "[ hf : sec ] , we consider first the purely electronic problem in the absence of e - ph interaction .",
    "we start the discussion from particular limiting cases for which well - controlled statements , or at least intuitively clear ones , can be made , without the need of any new specific calculations . in the appendix we will also consider , because it is useful in connection with the electron - phonon case , the unphysical limit of strong on - site attraction ( large and negative @xmath1 ) .      for @xmath58 ,",

    "antiferromagnetism is frustrated on the triangular lattice .",
    "zero temperature long range order ( lro )  if present  should be of the three - sublattice @xmath64-nel type , which can be also seen as a commensurate spiral spin density wave ( s - sdw ) .",
    "because it does not imbalance charge , this state is not further affected by electron - phonon coupling .    in summary",
    ", we expect for large values of @xmath1 a wide - gap mott insulator with a s - sdw ( spins lying in a plane , forming @xmath64 angles ) , a @xmath3 _ magnetic _ unit cell , but uniform charge ( no cdw ) .",
    "this is , most likely , the state to be found on the si - terminated and c - terminated sic(0001 ) surface at t=0 @xcite .",
    "the e - ph coupling can effectively reduce @xmath1 , but not @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to consider the hypothetical regime @xmath65 .",
    "when the first - neighbor electron - electron repulsion @xmath2 is large the system , in order to minimize the interaction energy , will prefer a @xmath3 cdw - like ground state , with two electrons on one sublattice ( a ) , a single electron on another sublattice ( b ) , and zero electrons on the third sublattice ( c ) ( see fig .",
    "[ triang_cdw : fig ] ) .",
    "these states are still highly degenerate ( in the absence of hopping ) due to spin degeneracy for the single unpaired electron on sublattice b. a gap @xmath1 separates these states from the lowest - energy excited configurations ( see fig .  [",

    "we notice the following points : i ) for the occupied states ( positive bias ) the pure cdw phase has , as expected , a larger contrast than the magnetic phase . as we neglect the tunneling factors @xmath172 , in the limit of large positive effective bias we recover the total asymmetry in the charge of the two inequivalent atoms , @xmath186 , indicated by a dashed horizontal line in the insets .",

    "ii ) for empty states ( negative bias ) the contrast is even more surprising : at small bias it is very large in both cases a ) and b ) . by increasing the bias , the contrast for the pure cdw case tends monotonically to a large value , whereas the magnetic case shows a strong non monotonicity .",
    "these results suggest that one should look more carefully , and quantitatively , at the behavior of the asymmetry between stm peak currents as a function of the bias , including the region of relatively small biases : the different behavior of the asymmetry of the magnetic case versus the pure cdw case should be marked enough  and survive in a more refined analysis including @xmath172  as to make the stm map a good way of discriminating between the two scenarios .",

    "we stress that , in this case , @xmath2 is the coupling responsible for the @xmath3 symmetry of the unit cell , whereas the role of the electron - phonon coupling is that of destroying magnetism by effectively decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "electron - phonon coupling alone is not sufficient to justify a commensurate @xmath3 cdw .",
    "\\(vi ) either of the phases in ( iv ) or ( v ) could be natural candidates for explaining the weak @xmath3 cdw seen experimentally on sn - pb / ge(111 ) .",
