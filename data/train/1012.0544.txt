    "quantum memories for light @xcite are key elements of quantum repeaters @xcite , which are necessary to distribute entanglement over long distances for future quantum networks @xcite .",
    "quantum memories based on atomic ensembles @xcite are particularly attractive in practice because the light - matter coupling is enhanced by the large number of atoms and by collective interference effects . in the retrieval process collective interference can strongly enhance the re - emission of the stored light in a well - defined direction , compared to the non - directional background emission .",
    "this makes it possible to achieve high retrieval efficiencies @xcite and small noise - to - signal ratios .    for long - distance applications such as quantum repeaters",
    "it is essential for the memories to allow long storage times .",
    "this can be achieved by using low - lying atomic states ( spin states ) for storage @xcite . however , spin states are typically affected by inhomogeneous broadening , i.e. different atoms in the ensemble have slightly different energies . for atomic gases",
    "this can be due to residual external magnetic fields or intensity - dependent light shifts ( for optical dipole traps ) . in atomic gases it is possible to work with field - insensitive clock transitions @xcite to suppress inhomogeneous broadening due to magnetic fields .",
    "solid - state atomic ensembles , such as rare - earth ion doped crystals , are attractive because there are no unwanted effects due to atomic motion and because solid - state systems promise enhanced scalability .",
    "however , they also have inhomogeneous broadening of the spin transitions .",
    "for example , in rare - earth doped crystals the rare - earth ions themselves produce a spatially varying potential due to spin - spin interactions @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous broadening is important because in the absence of control techniques it limits the coherence time of collective memory excitations to the inverse of the inhomogeneous linewidth , which is typically in the tens of microseconds range and is much shorter than the desired storage times .",
    "this effect can be compensated using spin - echo techniques , such as the application of a single or a pair of @xmath0 pulses .",
    "the coherence time can be further extended even beyond the single - atom @xmath1 time by applying chains of @xmath0 pulses ( bang - bang control ) @xcite .    in practice",
    "the control pulses are never perfect . in a recent experiment @xcite the most important imperfection",
    "was shown to be an inhomogeneity in the rf intensity across the sample , leading to a variation of about 1% in the total pulse area seen by individual atoms .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors argued that for successful operation in the quantum regime ( i.e. when single atomic excitations are stored ) the @xmath0 pulses would have to be precise to of order @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of atoms .",
    "typically , solid - state ensembles contain of order @xmath4 to @xmath5 atoms , such a level of precision would thus be completely out of reach .",
    "the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite were criticized in ref .",
    "@xcite , but to our knowledge the question has not been fully resolved until now .    in the present paper",
    "we study this problem in detail .",
    "the argument of ref .",
    "@xcite was based on the fact that imperfect @xmath0 pulses will lead to unwanted atomic excitations , which will cause background emissions .",
    "however , we will see that these emissions are non - collective and hence non - directional . as a consequence ,",
    "good memory operation is achievable with realistic @xmath0 pulses .",
    "there are several different ensemble - based quantum memory protocols . for definiteness , in the following we focus on the well - known duan - lukin - cirac - zoller ( dlcz ) protocol @xcite .",
    "however , with small modifications our results apply to many other protocols , including storage based on electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , off - resonant raman transitions @xcite , controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening @xcite , and atomic frequency combs @xcite .    in the dlcz quantum memory protocol , as shown in fig.[fig1](a ) , an off - resonant write pulse undergoes raman scattering , leading to the creation of a single photon and a single collective excitation in the state @xmath6 .",
    "this collective excitation dephases due to inhomogeneous broadening of the @xmath7 transition , but the application of a @xmath0 pulse in the middle of the storage time , see fig.[fig1](b ) , can prepare a rephased atomic collective excitation at the time of retrieval .",
    "a read pulse can now be applied , which leads to the directional emission of the read photon , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "we study the effects of spin - echo related imperfections in the described protocol .",
    "we begin with a semi - classical treatment for uniform errors in the @xmath0 pulses in section ii .",
    "then we give a fully quantum - mechanical treatment for the ( most relevant ) case of small @xmath0 pulse errors in section iii , and we show that its results agree with the semi - classical approach .",
    "we treat the case of non - uniform @xmath0 pulse errors in appendix a. in section iv we consider the effects of imperfect optical pumping , i.e. an imperfect initial state . in section",
    "v we use the semi - classical approach to discuss the application of multiple @xmath0 pulses ( bang - bang control ) . in section",
    "vi we give our conclusions .",
    "we start with a semi - classical approach . here the collective atomic state is treated as a tensor product of single - atom states .",
    "the single - excitation component of this tensor product corresponds to the true quantum state , which is why the two approaches give equivalent results in the single - photon regime , cf .",
    "section iii below .",
    "consider an ensemble of @xmath8 type three - level atoms with two slightly split ground states @xmath9 and @xmath6 , and an excited state @xmath10 . at the beginning ,",
    "all of the atoms are ideally pumped into the ground state @xmath9 . applying the write pulse that scatters a ( stokes ) photon ,",
    "transforms the state of the @xmath11 atom at the position @xmath12 into , @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the contribution of each atom to the collective excitation , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-vector of the write pulse and @xmath18 that of the scattered ( stokes ) photon . for single - photon storage using an ensemble with @xmath3 atoms , @xmath19 .",
    "the total atomic state , as the product of single atomic states , implies that in the limit of @xmath20 the semi - classical atomic state tends to quantum mechanical state , see below . for weak light storage",
    "this limit is equivalent to limit of large number of atoms , @xmath21 .",
    "now , let us consider the effect of inhomogeneous broadening and the @xmath0 pulse . in the semi - classical picture one can easily use unitary evolution of a single atom in absence of the electromagnetic field to represent the dephasing ( rephasing ) before ( after ) applying the @xmath0 pulse .",
    "the propagator is given by , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the detuning from the central transition for the @xmath11 atom .",
    "the @xmath23 have an inhomogeneous distribution with a width @xmath24 .",
    "then , the state of an atom after the time interval @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "an efficient retrieval is impossible for long storage times such that @xmath27 , since the readout amplitude is governed by the average atomic polarization , which is greatly reduced by the dephasing that takes place due to the temporal phase factors @xmath28 that vary from atom to atom .",
    "applying the rf @xmath0 pulse , which is tuned to the central frequency of the @xmath7 transition , can bring this random phase into a negligible global phase at a certain time . in order to represent the @xmath0 pulse ,",
    "let us recall the expression of the propagator of two levels of the atom under a pulsed excitation with the rabi frequency @xmath29 in the rotating wave approximation , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the temporal duration of the pulse .",
    "the final state after applying a @xmath0 pulse at @xmath32 and waiting the time interval @xmath33 is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 represents a perfect @xmath0 pulse and @xmath37 is the error .",
    "one can now retrieve the read photon by applying the read pulse .",
    "hence , we need to consider the spatial phase that comes from the read pulse to find the direction of the read photon",
    ". the spatial phase dependence due to the rf pulse can be ignored , because @xmath38 for realistic sample dimensions .",
    "considering this fact , the final state after applying the read pulse is given by , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath17-vector of the read pulse .    by transferring the population of the state @xmath9 into an excited state , the spin coherence transforms into an optical coherence , which leads to emission of the optical echo .",
    "the following shows how the atomic polarization would serve as the source of the echo signal , @xmath41 where , @xmath42 is the electric dipole moment and @xmath43 is the radiation intensity of one isolated atom . it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ psifinal ] ) that terms with atom - dependent temporal phases appear in the atomic polarization in the eq .",
    "( [ echointensity ] ) .",
    "since the emission is governed by the average over single atomic polarizations , only those terms for which these phases are canceled contribute significantly to the echo intensity . analyzing different terms in @xmath44",
    "one finds that the term @xmath45 is the only one for which one can exclude the atom - dependent temporal phase , which is called rephasing .",
    "this can take place under the condition @xmath46 , which implies that the @xmath0 pulse has to be applied at the middle of the process .",
    "the dipole moment of each single atom serves as a source of radiation . in the far field approximation and under the rephasing condition @xmath47",
    ", one can show that the amplitude of the readout from the whole ensemble in the direction @xmath48 is proportional to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "hence , for @xmath51 the readout intensity is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds to constructive interference of the re - emission from all of the atoms at a certain direction @xmath53 .",
    "however , even by applying an ideal @xmath0 pulse the radiation at other directions is not zero . the background re - emission ( non - directional ) intensity is proportional to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 . accordingly , the intensity ratio of the collectively enhanced re - emission ( directional ) and the randomly distributed background re - emission ( non - directional ) is @xmath3 , see fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "for example , for counter - propagation of the write and read pulses the phase - matching condition gives @xmath56 .",
    "however , the error in the @xmath0 pulse prevents achieving the highest possible the echo amplitude and presents a source of noise .",
    "_ efficiency reduction .",
    "_ by considering these points one can calculate the atomic polarization , @xmath57 , because @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , the intensity of the echo is , @xmath59 where @xmath43 has the same definition as in eq .",
    "( [ echointensity ] ) . eventually , the total efficiency of any process depends on the optical depth , performance of the experimental facilities and other theoretical and experimental details which are related to the protocol and the experimental setup .",
    "however , the present result allows to find the efficiency reduction due to the error in the @xmath0 pulse that is important in our analysis .",
    "_ noise - to - signal ratio .",
    "_ due to error in the rephasing pulse ( @xmath60 ) there is a noise in the re - emission .",
    "it is important to analyze the intensity of the noise , because for high memory fidelity the noise to echo ratio has to be small .",
    "a single @xmath0 pulse interchanges the states of the atoms from @xmath6 to @xmath9 and vice versa",
    ". however , an error in the @xmath0 pulse produces population in the ground state @xmath9 even without applying write pulse at the beginning .",
    "this would lead to fluorescent radiation .",
    "hence , it can be distinguished by the non - zero terms in @xmath61 for @xmath62 , which means even with no write pulse the error by itself can produce population in @xmath9 .",
    "quantitatively , the fluorescent radiation can be specified by @xmath63 which is the term in @xmath64 that does not originate from the read - in process ( @xmath62 ) , but gives a non - zero projection on @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the intensity of the noise that originates from error in the @xmath0 pulse can be given by , @xmath66 obviously , the fluorescent radiation as the source of the noise has the spatial dependence of a single photon radiation .",
    "consequently , the semi - classical picture yields an equally distributed noise ( non - directional ) that comes from single atom radiation of ensemble of the atoms , because of error in the rephasing pulse .    in order to analyze the effect of an imperfect @xmath0 pulse on the fidelity , it is important to study the noise - to - signal ratio .",
    "the following presents the noise - to - signal ratio , @xmath67 keeping in mind that @xmath19 for single - photon storage .",
    "the higher the noise - to - signal ratio , the less fidelity we have . in @xcite ,",
    "1% variation has been realized in the intensity of the rf pulse that causes the same error in the pulse area .",
    "such error gives quite low noise - to - signal ratio of @xmath68 and only wastes 0.1% of the efficiency .",
    "the semi - classical calculation suggests that the typical 1% error in the @xmath0 pulse which is far beyond the @xmath2 precision , does not impose a major constraint on the efficiency and fidelity .",
    "in addition to the semi - classical calculations , it is interesting to reconsider the problem using the quantum mechanical description . in the next section ,",
    "we perform fully quantum mechanical investigation for the same question .",
    "in this section , we perform fully quantum mechanical analysis on a global error in the @xmath0 pulse .",
    "we consider an ideal initial state where all the atoms have been pumped into the ground state .      as we discussed before",
    ", the large detuning of the write laser from @xmath69 leads to scattering of a photon and creating a collective atomic excitation .",
    "the theory of light - atom interaction is well established to describe interaction between the field and the atomic dipole moment . in general",
    ", one can represent the interaction hamiltonian as , @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote atomic levels @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath6 .",

    ", we assume the dipole - field coupling is identical for all the atoms and we have not considered the transverse profile .",
    "one can extract the interaction hamiltonian for the write laser and the scattered photon from eq .",
    "( [ intham ] ) , see fig.[fig1](a ) . by combining the interaction hamiltonians and considering adiabatic elimination of the excited , @xmath10",
    ", one can describe the read - in part of the process as follows , @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the rabi frequency of the classical write field .",
    "the unitary evolution under this effective interaction hamiltonian describes the creation of a stokes photon via raman scattering , which is accompanied by the creation of a collective atomic state .",
    "the collective state is @xmath80 where @xmath81 shows all atoms in the ground state and the @xmath11 atom in the spin state @xmath6 and @xmath82 . here",
    ", we neglect the terms with more than one excitation , because we are interested in single photon storage .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian governs the evolution of the atomic and the photonic state of the system .",
    "our analysis follows the evolution of the atomic state .",
    "however , later in this section , we will refer to the above discussion in order to find the intensity of the readout based on the norm of the final atomic state .",
    "one can find the state @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ colexc ] ) by applying the schwinger bosonic creation operator or equally weighted superposition of @xmath84 operators , @xmath85 .",
    "the inhomogeneous spin broadening implies that each atom has a slightly different energy than the other atom s spin level that indicates any atom will evolve based on its small energy detuning specified by @xmath86 . after the time interval @xmath87 the state @xmath83",
    "will be evolved to @xmath88 .",
    "the effect of dephasing as a result of inhomogeneous spin broadening can be described as an atom - dependent phase accumulation of the single collective atomic excitation .",
    "the following operator is appropriate to mathematical modeling of the dephasing after the time @xmath89 , @xmath90 where @xmath91 , see @xcite , where the operator @xmath92 shows the identity operator that acts on the rest of the atoms .",
    "the operator in eq .",
    "( [ phaope ] ) can be used to show the rephasing after applying the @xmath0 pulse .",
    "hence , one can represent the dephased state as @xmath93 .",
    "at first let us recall how an ideal @xmath0 pulse treat the atoms , which it swaps @xmath9 to @xmath6 and vice versa .",
    "one can describe that as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , see @xcite .",
    "after applying the @xmath0 pulse , the operator @xmath96 leads to a rephasing of the collective excitation because for each term in the collective state the previously non - excited atoms now acquire phases whereas the previously excited atom does nt .",
    "finally , the stored pulse will be retrieved by applying the read field , leading to the emission of the readout photon , see fig.[fig1](c ) .",
    "the readout part of the process can be represented by the operator @xmath97 , that is based on the same discussion as for the read - in . eventually , the whole process comprised of creation of collective excitation , dephasing , @xmath0 pulse , rephasing and the read pulse that leads to the final state can be described as @xmath98 .    using eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) and the analogous hamiltonian for the readout process it is straightforward to include the quantum states of the light field for the stokes and readout photons into the description .",
    "one sees that the emission amplitude for the readout photon can be obtained directly from the norm of the atomic state @xmath99 .",
    "note that there is no preferred direction for the stokes photon emission @xcite .",
    "as before , we are not really interested in the absolute emission probability , but in how the probability varies as a function of the direction of emission for the read photon , and under the influence of errors in the control pulses .",
    "the collective enhancement happens again under the phase - matching condition @xmath100 .    in the ideal case ,",
    "considering these conditions one can easily derive that @xmath101 .",
    "the later result is based on considering an ideal @xmath0 pulse in the calculations and it takes place under the phase - matching condition , @xmath100 . as we studied in the semi - classical approach ,",
    "the re - emission in other directions ( @xmath102 ) is negligible for the case with large number of atoms in the ensemble .",
    "our discussion here was focused on the case of the dlcz protocol , but the evolution of the atomic state is identical in the other quantum memory protocols mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the only difference is that in those protocols the creation of the initial atomic excitation is accompanied by the absorption of a single photon rather than its emission .",
    "we now study the effect of imperfect @xmath0 pulse as one of the sources of error in the spin echo memories .",
    "the most general error in the @xmath0 pulse can be considered as a small rotation @xmath103 around a random direction @xmath104 for each atom that can be represented by the operator @xmath105 .",
    "this operator can show the effect of the inhomogeneity in the intensity of the @xmath0 pulse across the sample @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we first consider a global error that can be interpreted as lack of accuracy in pulse shaping . the most general error that affects each atom differently",
    "is studied in the appendix .",
    "the corresponding operator for such error which is equally distributed over all atoms is @xmath106 .",
    "essentially , the question of studying the effect of the error in the @xmath0 pulse is reduced to the problem of analyzing norm of the state @xmath107    in order to facilitate analyzing the norm of the state @xmath108 we now simplify the final state .",

    "one can derive that @xmath114 , which shows rotation in a new direction @xmath115 .",
    "finally , by applying the unitary @xmath116 the final state can be simplified to @xmath117 where the operator @xmath118 is given by , @xmath119 where @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this simplification allows us to distinguish three different terms in the final state based on the effect of @xmath123 on the @xmath124 .",

    "one can benefit from these terms to represent the final state as @xmath131 where @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 . obviously ,",
    "because of different number of excitations , these terms are perpendicular .",
    "thus , one can study the norm of the final state , easily .    as it can be seen from the eq .",
    "( [ psif ] ) , because of @xmath135 , the first term corresponds to the directional emission of the readout photon . as we discussed in the previous section ,",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) , the readout is strongly peaked around the direction for which all of the single - atom re - emissions can constructively interfere with each other .",
    "the readout intensity at the other directions ( the non - directional background ) is suppressed by the ratio @xmath2 that is a quite small number for a typical @xmath136 .",
    "hence , the @xmath137 term determines the intensity of the echo . in other words , shining the read laser with @xmath138 result in the emission of a readout photon that its intensity is peaked around @xmath56 .",
    "the non - directional noise in the re - emission can be attributed to the terms that correspond to @xmath139 and @xmath140 coefficients , because taking average over position of the atoms leads to randomly distributed re - emission from each single atom .",
    "it can be shown that the norm of the state in eq .",

    ". then it leads to @xmath158 .",

    "( [ noiseint1 ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the noise shows a correspondence with the fluorescent radiation in the semi - classical approach .",

    "thanks to collective enhancement , the non - directional noise will not swamp the echo signal , for realistic control pulse accuracy @xcite .",
    "an imperfection in the @xmath0 pulse is not the only source of inefficiency in the spin echo memories . in our calculations",
    "so far we have assumed an ideal situation where all the atoms are initially in the ground state .",
    "our quantum mechanical approach allows us to study the effect of an imperfect initial state with @xmath160 atoms excited to the state @xmath6 .",
    "this can happen in experiments as a result of an imperfect optical pumping in the initialization of the atomic ensemble . without loss of generality",

    "now , the @xmath165 terms of the form @xmath166 also contribute to the noise . consequently , as the upper bound , for the term that corresponds to @xmath137 can be achieved for @xmath170 , one can obtain the following upper bound for the noise - to - signal ratio @xmath171 , @xmath172 investigating this equation it can be seen that the two different sources of error compete in producing noise . for the case with small fraction of excitations in the initial state , @xmath173 , such that @xmath174 then the error in @xmath0 pulse is the dominant term in the noise . otherwise , in case of @xmath175 the imperfection in the initial state plays an important role in increasing the upper bound of the noise - to - signal ratio .",

    "the intensity of the signal after applying @xmath178 pairs of @xmath0 pulses is given by , @xmath179 the intensity that is associated to the noise also can be approximated by @xmath180 .",
    "thus , after applying sequence of the rephasing pulses , the noise - to - signal ratio reads @xmath181 for @xmath182 .",
    "for instance , with typical 1% error in the @xmath0 pulse one can benefit from 30 pairs of rephasing pulses , while still achieving an efficiency factor of 91% and a noise - to - signal ratio of 0.04 . if the pulses are 4 msec apart as in ref .",
    "@xcite , 30 pairs of pulses correspond to a storage time of 240 msec .",
    "@xcite managed to increase the @xmath1 time to 1 sec , by proper alignment of the magnetic field , that is much longer than 80 msec in ref .",
    "@xcite . this field configuration would allow one to put the rephasing pulses further apart .",
    "for example , one can consider the rephasing pulses 40 msec apart , giving a 2.4 sec storage time with an efficiency factor of 91% and a noise - to - signal ratio of 0.04 .",
    "we have shown that realistic imperfections in the @xmath0 pulses only have small effects on the retrieval efficiency of quantum memories , and that the corresponding noise is also acceptable .",
    "the latter fact is due to collective interference . while the emission of the read photon is strongly enhanced in the direction given by the phase matching condition , the noise due to pulse imperfections is non - directional . as a consequence ,",

    "we have also studied errors due to imperfect optical pumping , i.e. imperfect initial state preparation .",
    "we find that these errors are likely to dominate over @xmath0 pulse errors in many circumstances , but that they can also be kept at an acceptable level .",
    "our discussion was phrased in terms of the dlcz protocol @xcite for concreteness .",
    "however , the same results apply to other ensemble - based quantum memory protocols including those based on electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , off - resonant raman transitions @xcite , controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening @xcite , and atomic frequency combs @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the prospects for the use of spin - echo techniques in light - matter interfaces at the quantum level are very good .",
    "we hope that our work will further encourage experimental work in this direction .    _",
    "_ this work was supported by an nserc discovery grant , an aitf new faculty award , the eu project q - essence , the swiss nccr quantum photonics , and icore .",
    "we thank m. afzelius , n. gisin and e. saglamyurek for useful discussions .",
    "as we discussed , the main error in rf pulses is the variance in the intensity of the rf pulse that leads to inhomogeneity of the rf pulse across the sample @xcite .",
    "consequently , the error would be different for the atoms at the different positions .",
    "here we extend our analysis to study such errors .",
    "we can follow the same approach as we used in the paper to simplify the final state that eases the rest of the calculation .",
    "therefore , the final state @xmath108 up to a unitary operator and a global phase is @xmath184 considering the @xmath0 pulse at the middle of the process , @xmath113 , and by conducting some algebra one can derive that @xmath185 , which shows rotation in a new direction @xmath186 . finally , by applying the unitary @xmath187 the final state can be simplified to @xmath188 where the operator @xmath118 , which acts on @xmath11 atom is given by , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "finally , the state can be simplified to @xmath193 fortunately , having different number of excitations in the final state simplifies the calculation of the norm .",
    "as we discussed , the first term contributes in directional emission of the readout photon .",
    "hence , the @xmath194s play role in finding the intensity of the echo . in other words , shining the read laser with @xmath138 result in the emission of a readout photon that is peaked around @xmath56 .",
    "the non - directional noise in the re - emission can be attributed to the terms corresponding to @xmath195 and @xmath196 coefficients , because average over the position of the atoms leads to randomly distributed re - emission .",
    "it can be shown that the following gives norm of the @xmath197 in eq .",
    "( [ app - psif ] ) , @xmath198    in order to analyze the efficiency reduction the lower bound of echo intensity have to be studied .",
    "considering the phase - matching condition it can be shown that @xmath199 . for small errors , @xmath200 and keeping terms to @xmath144 , it can be shown that the following lower bound can be achieved for @xmath201 @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the largest error and @xmath3 is number of the atoms . with the aim of studying the intensity of the noise that is proportional to the @xmath204 for the small errors , @xmath200 , one needs to consider the @xmath149 as a random phase , that takes place for long enough times that @xmath150 is comparable with the @xmath151 .",
    "it can be shown that for random @xmath152 , @xmath205 , because @xmath206 .",
    "hence , one can conclude that @xmath207 can be approximated as @xmath208 . by taking these considerations into account and keeping terms up to @xmath159 give the noise intensity upper bound as @xmath209 which implies that a uniformly directed error with @xmath145 gives the upper bound for the noise . obviously , the second term in the noise intensity is proportional to @xmath157 that is negligible for the small errors .",
    "then it leads to @xmath210 .",
    "this shows that the fully quantum mechanical treatment for an inhomogeneous error is in good agreement with the results for global errors derived in the paper .",
