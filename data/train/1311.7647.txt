    "these show that young sources are relatively x - ray luminous ( @xmath12 erg s@xmath3 ) . however , the entire radio structure is typically enclosed within angular scales which can not be resolved by x - ray telescopes ( a few arcseconds or smaller ) , thus the x - ray morphology is usually not accessible @xcite .",
    "studies of the origin of the x - ray emission , including an identification of distinct high - energy emission components , rely mainly on the analysis of x - ray spectral features , which is hampered by the limited photon statistics @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "it is hard to disentangle the contribution of the jet- and lobe - related non  thermal emission from the one related to the accretion processes ( either the x - ray thermal emission of the innermost part of the disk or that resulting from comptonization of disk photons by electrons in a hot corona ) . + a significant level of non - thermal x - ray flux can be produced via inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of different seed photons in the compact lobes of gps radio galaxies @xcite . given the typical gps linear sizes ( @xmath11 kpc ) the nuclear photon fields , e.g. optical - uv disk and ir torus photons , are intense enough to provide , when comptonized , x - ray luminosities of the order of @xmath13@xmath14  erg  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in the case of gps and css quasars , the closer jet alignment to the line of sight should favor the beamed jet component .",

    "the goals of the study are : 1- to refine model predictions for the @xmath0-ray emission of the jets of young radio sources ; 2- to constrain the entire non - thermal high - energy emission continua of these objects .",
    "we adopt the following approach : we first set up a general leptonic synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) model for the non - thermal emission of jets in compact radio sources ; then we generate a library of their broad - band spectral energy distributions ( sed ) for a wide range of selected jet parameters ( linear sizes , jet powers , jet bulk velocities etc . ) . while previous studies focused on the isotropic emission associated with the extended structures of young sources , i.e. lobes and cocoons , in this work we concentrate on the jet beamed radiation and consider powerful radio quasars .",
    "indeed , an important difference between jet and lobe emission arises from the jet relativistic ( bulk ) motion : the jet emission is relativistically beamed and its detection also depends on the observer viewing angle . in models presented in the literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    ". the intensity of ec / syn luminosity can be comparable to the high energy emission potentially produced by the blazar core itself ( e.g. via ssc or compton scattering of the photons of the broad line regions , blr , and of the dusty torus ) .",
