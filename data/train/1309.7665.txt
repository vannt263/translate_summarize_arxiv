    "finite impulse response ( fir ) multirate filter banks have become important tools in a variety of digital audio and image coding applications .",
    "perfect reconstruction ( pr ) filter banks are invertible linear transformations and are typically employed in subband coding schemes that split their sources into multiple frequency subbands for encoding and transmission .",
    "this enables subband rate allocation strategies that provide significant coding gain over direct quantization and entropy encoding of untransformed input .",
    "the present paper studies two - channel filter banks , which are commonly cascaded to generate more complicated frequency partitions . as with fourier transforms , filter banks have corresponding analog transforms , and filter bank cascades are often called _ discrete wavelet transforms _ ( dwts ) if the filter bank corresponds to an analog wavelet multiresolution analysis  @xcite .",
    "the reason subband coding is often proving superior to traditional block transform coding based on fourier , cosine , or karhunen - loeve transforms is _",
    "localization_. the subbands produced by a filter bank are samplings of the signal s information content that are simultaneously localized in both time ( or space ) _ and _ frequency .",
    "this eliminates the need for block - based or windowed transforms to achieve joint time - frequency localization .",
    "such joint localization allows frequency - dependent quantization and entropy coding to adapt to nonstationary input .",
    "moreover , unlike traditional closed - loop prediction schemes such as differential pulse code modulation ( dpcm ) , fir filter banks are _",
    "_ open-__loop transforms that allow random access into coded bitstreams by decoding a limited subset of bitstream data nonrecursively .",
    "nonetheless , fourier analysis still has a 200-year head start on wavelets and filter bank theory .",
    "the use of fourier transforms to analyze arbitrary translation - invariant linear operators is highly evolved .",
    "fourier analysis has been defined on arbitrary locally compact abelian groups , and the effort to generalize fourier analysis to noncommutative settings has led to the theory of unitary representations for nonabelian groups .",
    "applications of fourier analysis in science and engineering are widespread .",
    "even recent developments like numerical algorithms and hardware based on the fast fourier transform ( fft ) enjoy big head starts over algorithmic and hardware developments for filter banks .",
    "the present paper attempts to narrow the maturity gap between fourier and multiresolution analysis a little bit by using established mathematics to characterize the algebraic structure of multirate filter banks . rather than generalizing to highly abstract settings or exotic filter banks ,",
    "we concentrate on developing a deeper understanding of filter banks that have already proven their value in practical applications , namely , two - channel linear phase fir pr filter banks .",
    "the _ whole - sample symmetric _ ( ws ) and _ half - sample symmetric _",
    "( hs ) classes , whose highpass impulse responses are , respectively , symmetric or antisymmetric ( see fig .  [ ws - hs ] ) , correspond to multiresolution analyses with compactly supported symmetric or antisymmetric mother wavelets .",
    "we will show that these two principal classes of linear phase filter banks can be described in detail using group theory , something that has not been done previously .",
    "our primary tool is the uniqueness theory for lifting factorizations developed in  @xcite and outlined in  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : coding ] presents background on communication coding standards involving filter banks so readers can appreciate the role filter banks play in contemporary digital communications and can assess the evolving state of the art .",
    "section  [ sec : review ] briefly reviews notation and terminology from @xcite regarding group lifting structures .",
    "section  [ sec : free ] identifies lifting cascade groups that have unique irreducible group lifting factorizations   with free products of lower and upper triangular lifting matrix groups .",
    "section  [ sec : semidirect ] presents the semidirect product representation of scaled lifting groups , a result that follows easily , via an independent argument , from the same hypotheses as .",
    "this provides the group - theoretic characterization of the ws filter bank group . the hs class , which does _ not _ form a group , is completely described in terms of _ cosets _ of its associated matrix groups .",
    "section  [ sec : comparison ] shows how the group - theoretic structure of scaled lifting groups parameterizes linear phase filter banks in terms of a unique factorization framework that structurally enforces perfect reconstruction and linear phase properties . a homomorphic correspondence between the formal algebraic properties of scaled lifting groups and _ most _ of the axioms for vector spaces exhibits scaled lifting groups as a type of `` noncommutative vector space '' ( i.e. , a nonabelian group with a group of scaling automorphisms ) .",
    "international standards for narrowband digital speech coding based on the venerable a - law and @xmath8-law logarithmic companding algorithms date back to itu - t recommendation g.711 ( 1972 )  @xcite , which was widely deployed in public switched telephone network ( pstn ) systems .",
    "the g.711 encoder ingests 3.4  khz of audio bandwidth digitized at 8  kilosamples per second ( ksps ) with 13- or 14-bit amplitude quantization .",
    "it outputs 8-bit pulse code modulation ( pcm ) words using an a - law or @xmath8-law quantizer for a rate of 64  kilobits per second ( kbps ) .",
    "this is a pure fixed - rate scalar quantization encoder ; there is no frequency transformation nor entropy coding .",
    "speech coding is heavily constrained by the latency that humans can tolerate and application - specific processing , memory , and power limitations .",
    "thus , entropy coding was not added to g.711 until 2009 , when several variable - length coding options , including rice - golomb coding , appeared in itu - t recommendation g.711.0  @xcite .    a feature that is becoming increasingly important as high - fidelity media applications proliferate and speech has to share bandwidth on multiplexed channels is quality - of - service ( qos ) scalability .",
    "itu - t recommendation g.711.1  @xcite is a backwards - compatible extension of g.711 that supports 16  ksps ( 7  khz bandwidth ) `` wideband '' speech while generating a layered ( multiple bit rate ) codestream that contains an embedded 8  ksps g.711-compliant narrowband bitstream .",
    "this is done using a two - channel , 32-tap linear phase _ pseudo quadrature mirror filter _ ( pqmf ) bank to split the wideband input into 8  ksps lowpass and highpass subbands .",
    "linear phase is desirable to avoid nonlinear phase distortion in quantized speech .",
    "the quadrature mirror relation reduces numerical filter bank design to the optimization of a single lowpass filter , and if that filter has linear phase then the overall analysis - synthesis transfer function will also have linear phase .",
    "unfortunately , the only two - channel fir pr solutions satisfying _ both _ of these conditions are generalized haar filter banks , so pqmf banks like the one in g.711.1 provide `` near - perfect , '' alias - free reconstruction with a linear phase transfer function that has _ approximately _ constant magnitude  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5.2 ) .",
    "the g.711.1 lowband is encoded as layer  0 using one of the core g.711 pcm algorithms .",
    "an optional enhancement bitstream ( layer  1 ) encodes the residual from layer  0 by adaptive allocation of anywhere from zero to three additional bits per pcm codeword , constrained to a rate of 16  kbps , for an enhanced narrowband codestream with a rate of 80  kbps .",
    "wideband content is provided in layer  2 of g.711.1 by coding the highpass pqmf subband using a _ modified discrete cosine transform _ ( mdct ) .",
    "the @xmath9-channel mdct can be regarded as a windowed `` short - time discrete cosine transform '' in which the signal is blocked into length-@xmath10 blocks with 50% overlap and tapered by a window , much like the construction of short - time fourier transforms .",
    "a nontrivial fact is that , with proper window and cosine transform design , one can save just @xmath9 output samples from each length-@xmath10 block and still have an invertible transformation .",
    "obtaining critical sampling ( a 1:1 ratio of output to input samples ) with 50% overlap to reduce blocking artifacts is clearly desirable in source coding applications , but it is far from obvious that one can do so while maintaining invertibility  @xcite .",
    "one can also interpret mdcts as @xmath9-channel cosine - modulated filter banks in which every filter is a frequency - modulated version of a length-@xmath10 `` prototype '' lowpass filter , or window . because modulation is done with cosines rather than complex exponentials , a real - valued lowpass prototype yields real - valued bandpass filters .",
    "this greatly reduces design complexity : instead of designing @xmath9 filters , one only needs a single window satisfying appropriate conditions .",
    "moreover , the polyphase representation can be exploited to reduce implementation complexity by decoupling cosine modulation from the lowpass prototype .",
    "thus , the filter bank can be implemented `` separably , '' using the @xmath10-polyphase representation of the lowpass prototype and the @xmath9-point dct - iv transform , which can be applied using fft techniques  @xcite .",
    "this highlights an important development in source coding : the traditional distinction between filter bank - based `` subband coding '' and block - based `` transform coding '' has been blurred by mdcts since the lowpass filter is usually applied using polyphase time - domain methods while the cosine modulation is performed using fast block transforms .",
    "layer  2 of the g.711.1 codestream is formed using an 80-point mdct with a malvar sinusoidal window to split the 8  ksps pqmf highband into @xmath11 frequency channels .",
    "all but the four lowest - frequency channels are quantized using interleave conjugate - structure vector quantization , resulting in 80  bits per 5  ms frame , or 16  kbps for layer  2 .",
    "the bitrate for a 7  khz `` wideband '' codestream containing layers  0 and  2 is therefore 80  kbps while the bitrate for all three layers is 96  kbps .",
    "the layered structure of the g.711.1 wideband codestream enables a range of qos scalability features , such as narrowband g.711-compliant pstn compatibility and partial mixing of teleconferencing signals  @xcite .",
    "annex  d of g.711.1  @xcite extends the g.711.1 layered codestream to support `` superwideband '' ( 14  khz ) input sampled at 32  ksps with 16-bit precision .",
    "the superwideband input is split into two 16  ksps subbands by a 32-tap linear phase pqmf bank similar to the pqmf bank in the g.711.1 core encoder .",
    "the 16  ksps `` wideband '' lowpass subband is passed to the g.711.1 core encoder , where it is split again by the core pqmf bank into lowband and highband signals and encoded as described above , giving annex  d a two - level mallat - style subband decomposition .",
    "two highband enhancement layers improve performance in the 6.48.0  khz range .    a major change for g.711.1 in annex  d is dynamic classification of input into _ transient _ and _ non - transient _ frames based on the annex  d pqmf bank s 814  khz `` super higher band '' ( shb ) .",
    "the shb is split into 80 channels by a 160-point mdct .",
    "its output is used to classify non - transient frames into harmonic , normal , or noise - like frames and to switch between different modes for quantizing shb data using spectral and temporal envelope coding and mdct - domain vector quantization .",
    "layering annex  d enhancement and shb coding on top of g.711.1 codestreams creates four additional superwideband modes with bitrates of 96128  kbps  @xcite .",
    "the g.711.1 annex  d algorithm was developed jointly as a superwideband extension for itu - t recommendation g.722  @xcite , the first itu - t wideband voice standard , which uses a linear phase pqmf bank to encode wideband input in a two - channel adaptive dpcm scheme .",
    "itu - t recommendation g.729.1  @xcite is a wideband extension of the g.729 narrowband standard  @xcite , which is widely used for voice - over - ip ( voip ) communications .",
    "a 64-tap linear phase pqmf bank splits the 16  ksps input into 8  ksps lowpass and highpass subbands , as in g.711.1 .",
    "the lowband is encoded using code - excited linear prediction ( celp ) to produce a g.729-compatible core layer at 8  kbps and one 4  kbps narrowband enhancement layer .",
    "spectral and temporal envelope highband coding at 2  kbps yields a wideband codestream for just 14  kbps , while mdct vector quantization creates 9 highband enhancement layers providing scalability from 16 to 32  kbps in 2  kbps increments .",
    "annex  e of g.729.1  @xcite supports superwideband input ( 14  khz , 32  ksps ) with 5 layers providing rates from 36 to 64  kbps . unlike the superwideband extensions for g.711.1 and g.722 ,",
    "g.729.1 annex  e does not split the input using a pqmf bank .",
    "instead , g.729.1 annex  e employs essentially the same algorithm used to extend itu - t recommendation g.718  @xcite for superwideband input  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* annex  b ) .",
    "the 32  ksps input is antialias - filtered using an iir lowpass filter and subsampled to 16  ksps for input to the g.729.1/g.718 core wideband encoders .",
    "the full superwideband input is simultaneously transformed by a 640-channel mdct using a novel asymmetric window originally engineered for g.718  @xcite .",
    "the mdct 714  khz data is analyzed to classify individual frames as `` tonal '' or `` non - tonal '' ; different mdct vector quantization schemes then create layers extending the core wideband coding to superwideband .",
    "as speech coding covers wider bandwidths and diverse multimedia content , speech and general audio codecs are becoming more similar .",
    "this is particularly true of their time - frequency analysis , which is driven largely by receiver characteristics ; i.e. , the human auditory system  @xcite .",
    "there are still fundamental differences between speech and general audio , however , such as mature source models for speech , limitations on size , weight , and power for mobile phones , and the desire for high - fidelity audio to provide `` perceptually transparent '' coding across the entire auditory spectrum .",
    "the lack of detailed source models for general audio and the availability of greater computational power has driven high - fidelity audio towards adaptive quantization and entropy coding based on short - time quasi - stationary modeling of the auditory system  @xcite .",
    "the key feature of such models is the `` critical band '' theory of the cochlea as a spectrum analyzer modeled by a nonuniform bank of nonlinear ( amplitude - dependent ) bandpass filters exhibiting psychoacoustic masking behavior .",
    "this is approximated in practice by cascaded filter banks and mdcts with quantization strategies that exploit perceptual masking of weak tones by nearby stronger tones .",
    "one of the earliest high - fidelity audio standards to use perceptual modeling is the mpeg-1 part  3 standard ( 1992 )  @xcite created by the iso / iec motion picture experts group ( mpeg ) .",
    "mpeg-1 audio uses a uniform 32-channel , critically sampled , 512-point , near - perfect reconstruction cosine - modulated pqmf bank based on the dct - iii , reflecting the limitations of early-1990s filter bank technology .",
    "layers  1 and  2 use perceptual modeling to perform dynamic time - frequency bit allocation for block companding . layer  3 ( the `` mp3 '' algorithm ) refines the frequency partition by cascading the 32 uniform ( 750  hz bandwidth ) pqmf channels with adaptively switched mdcts .",
    "an 18-channel mdct creates narrow frequency bands ( 41.67  hz ) to resolve low- and mid - frequency critical bandwidths for perceptual coding of stationary frames while a 6-channel mdct provides better temporal resolution for mitigating pre - echo artifacts caused by transient attacks .",
    "transition windows preserve invertibility when switching between 6- and 18-channel mdcts .",
    "layer  3 also uses run - length and huffman entropy coding .",
    "the mpeg-2 part  3 standard  @xcite defines an embedded multichannel ( `` 5.1 '' ) surround - sound codestream that is backwards compatibility with mpeg-1 two - channel stereo decoding and supports lower sampling rates than mpeg-1 .",
    "mpeg-2 also has a more advanced , non - backwards - compatible audio codec known as advanced audio coding ( aac )  @xcite .",
    "the low complexity and main profiles of mpeg-2 aac eliminate the front - end pqmf bank in mpeg-1 in favor of a single mdct whose window size switches between 2048 points for stationary content and 256 points for transients .",
    "the scalable sample rate profile has a 4-channel front - end qmf bank followed by mdcts to enable an embedded codestream supporting multiple bitrates .",
    "the mpeg-4 part  3 standard  @xcite includes mpeg-2 aac in subpart  4 for `` general audio '' coding and adds a great many other object - based audio coding tools to create a qos - scalable toolkit supporting a vast range of audio modalities , including speech , parametric ( model - based ) audio , synthetic audio , midi , surround - sound , and various lossless modes .",
    "based on spectral analysis of the input , the aac mdct can switch between a sinusoidal window for narrowband selectivity and a kaiser - bessel window  @xcite for greater stopband attenuation .",
    "the perceptually driven design of kaiser - bessel mdct windows was pioneered for the dolby ac-2 and ac-3 algorithms  @xcite ; ac-3 is the audio codec for the u.s .",
    "hdtv broadcast standard  @xcite .",
    "one novel feature of the ac-3 mdct is that it can switch between 512-point and 256-point windows without using intervening transition windows to preserve invertibility  @xcite .      unlike audio , imagery",
    "essentially never contains sinusoidal waveforms , and the audio coding strategy of transforming a source into hundreds of narrowband , quasi - stationary channels with long block lengths is inappropriate for images . a good first approximation for natural images is to regard them as composed of smooth but irregularly shaped regions separated by abrupt jump discontinuities that are readily discerned by the highpass characteristic of the human visual system .",
    "while fine textures commonly exist in continuous - tone images , preservation of fine texture generally is not as perceptually important as preservation of sharp edges between regions .",
    "image transforms thus need to provide highly localized ( sparse ) representations of high - frequency transients ( edges ) , a requirement that does not match up well with the properties of fourier analysis .",
    "the most widely used international standard for continuous - tone imagery is the standard produced by the iso / iec joint photographic experts group and known as jpeg ( or jpeg-1 )  @xcite . as a result of comprehensive engineering and perceptual studies in the 198488 time period  @xcite , the jpeg committee chose a block - transform algorithm using a two - dimensional nonoverlapping @xmath12-pixel dct - ii  @xcite . the relatively small block size ( larger blocks would have provided more coding gain )",
    "represents a compromise reflecting the need for good spatial localization of information in the transform domain .",
    "moreover , the committee was sensitive to the risk of imposing high implementation costs ( for the 1980s ) in a first - generation communication standard .",
    "a bank of uniform scalar quantizers is applied to the dct output , with relative bit allocation between different frequencies given by a perceptually tuned quantization matrix and absolute bit rate controlled by a single scalar parameter .",
    "jpeg-1 offers huffman coding as well as a higher - performance / higher - complexity binary arithmetic coding option .",
    "the dct architecture creates a limited amount of qos scalability .",
    "progressive transmission across slow links can be provided by transmitting dct coefficients in order from lowest to highest spatial frequencies .",
    "hierarchical scalability can be obtained by decoding and rendering an 8:1 reduced - resolution thumbnail of an image using only the dc coefficient from each @xmath12 block .",
    "`` reversibility '' ( lossless coding ) is possible by entropy encoding and transmitting the residual from a lossy jpeg-1 representation .      in the late 1980s the u.s .",
    "federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) decided to digitize the u.s .",
    "criminal fingerprint database , which at the time consisted of an acre of filing cabinets holding over 100  million fingerprint cards .",
    "they found that jpeg-1 blocking artifacts were unavoidable at entropies below about 0.8  bits / pixel and interfered with both human and automated forensic end - users . after working with researchers at yale , washington university , and los alamos national lab ,",
    "the fbi chose a 2-d dwt approach using cascaded two - channel linear phase pr filter banks , optimal subband rate allocation , uniform scalar quantization , and adaptive huffman coding .",
    "the resulting _ wavelet / scalar quantization _ ( wsq ) specification  @xcite included a scheme for handling linear phase filter banks at image boundaries by symmetrically extending and periodizing finite - length input vectors , much like the interpretation of the dct - ii as the dft of a symmetrically extended vector  @xcite .      by the mid-1990s it was clear that subband coding offered significant improvements in both rate - distortion performance and qos scalability over jpeg-1 , so the iso committee created a new work item known as jpeg  2000 to address the growing list of applications inadequately served by jpeg-1  @xcite .",
    "jpeg  2000 was heavily influenced by the highly scalable embedded subband coding approach in the phd dissertation of taubman  @xcite .",
    "the theory of lifting factorizations  @xcite also had a big impact on jpeg  2000 , which uses lifting to specify implementation and signaling of pr filter banks .",
    "the ability to implement filter banks with dyadic lifting coefficients as nonlinear integer - to - integer ( `` reversible '' ) transforms  @xcite is exploited to provide lossy - to - lossless qos scalability , greatly improving on the lossless coding features of jpeg-1 .",
    "jpeg  2000 also uses symmetric extension boundary handling , which can be implemented directly in terms of lifting factorizations  @xcite .",
    "jpeg  2000 part  1 has one irreversible filter bank ( the same one used in wsq ) and one reversible option  ( * ? ?",
    "* annex  f ) . both are ws pr wavelet filter banks suitable for cascaded dwt decompositions .",
    "jpeg  2000 part  2 , _ extensions _ , allows users to signal user - defined ws pr filter banks  ( * ? ? ?",

    "part  2 and part  10 , _",
    "extensions for three - dimensional data _",
    "@xcite , include algorithms for using filter banks to decorrelate multi - banded images such as multispectral or volumetric image cubes .",
    "jpeg  2000 part  9 , _ interactivity tools , apis , and protocols _ ( jpip )  @xcite , exploits the joint space - frequency localization of dwt decompositions and the bit - plane localization of jpeg  2000 s binary arithmetic coding to provide a client - server protocol enabling highly scalable interactive retrieval of compressed data .",
    "jpeg  2000 part  1 is used in the u.s .",
    "national imagery transmission format standard ( nitfs )  @xcite for conventional military imagery , and a jpip profile is provided in  @xcite .",
    "much work remains to be done on applying jpeg  2000 part  2 extensions to the many unconventional modalities that arise in military applications , such as multi- and hyperspectral imagery , infrared , sar , lidar , etc .",
    "one military application that has received attention is _ large volume streaming data _ ( lvsd )",
    "@xcite , which consists of wide - area surveillance video often collected from airborne platforms .",
    "although lvsd is video imagery , the lvsd profile uses intraframe ( non - motion - compensated ) jpeg  2000 part  1 coding .",
    "lvsd applications are characterized by single - frame image analysis requirements , very large frame sizes ( up to a gigapixel or more ) , slow frame rates ( often less than 10  frames / sec . ) , and , sometimes , high bit depths or unconventional modalities , all of which weigh against mpeg solutions .",
    "another benefit of jpeg  2000 in lvsd applications is the jpip profile  @xcite , which facilitates single - frame analysis of gigapixel imagery .",
    "another video application that has adopted jpeg  2000 intraframe coding in preference to motion - compensated coding is the digital cinema initiatives ( dci ) specification for theater distribution of feature films  @xcite . for the dci application ,",
    "having a resolution - scalable format that supports extremely high fidelity ( `` better than traditional 35 mm prints '' ) is more important than meeting stringent bandwidth and hardware complexity constraints of the sort mpeg standards are designed to satisfy .",
    "e.g. , the maximum allowable dci bit rate is 250  mbps for the video signal ( not including audio ) whereas the maximum allowable video rate in the blu - ray format ( which uses mpeg-4 and vc-1 ) is 40  mbps .",
    "dwts have yet to achieve commercial success in motion - compensated video coding .",
    "video standards from mpeg-1 up through mpeg-4/h.264 _ advanced video coding _ ( avc )  @xcite and the new _ high - efficiency video coding _ ( hevc ) standard  @xcite have consistently used nonoverlapping block dcts to code motion prediction residuals . in avc the @xmath13-pixel motion prediction macroblocks may be partitioned into sub - macroblocks as small as @xmath14 to improve spatial localization , so avc employs an integer - to - integer approximation of the @xmath14 dct - ii to preserve the segmentation induced by block motion compensation .",
    "blocking artifacts are ameliorated by deblocking filters within the motion compensation prediction loop .",
    "intra - frame coding in avc uses a variety of spatial prediction filters to reduce spatial redundancy , so the dct block transform encoder is compressing prediction residuals even in intra - coded frames . as with mdcts on audio residuals , dct - iis",
    "provide good transform coding performance on closed - loop video prediction residuals .",
    "when the motion picture experts group called for proposals for a scalable extension to mpeg-4/h.264 avc , closed - loop motion compensation posed many challenges to both temporal and spatial scalability , and open - loop motion - compensated 3-d subband coding was expected to offer competitive alternatives ; see ohm  @xcite for an exposition of the situation circa 2005 .",
    "twelve of the 14 proposals submitted involved some form of 3-d discrete wavelet transform , but none of the wavelet proposals was able to overcome the considerable head start enjoyed by the avc approach . in the end , the iso / iec / itu - t joint video team used avc s reference picture memory control to enable hierarchical closed - loop temporal prediction and formed a layered codestream with inter - layer prediction to enable spatial resolution scalability  @xcite .",
    "the extension was approved as amendment  3 to mpeg-4/h.264 avc and incorporated as  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* annex  g : scalable video coding ) .",
    "it is an open question whether promising wavelet transform approaches such as  @xcite will eventually gain a foothold in the motion - compensated video coding market .",
    "in previous work @xcite the author developed a theory of _ group lifting structures _ that provides a group - theoretic framework for parameterizing classes of filter banks of practical interest , including linear phase fir filter banks . a major impetus for using group theory to describe filter banks",
    "is the fact that pr filter banks do not naturally form vector spaces but _ do _ form matrix groups in the polyphase representation ( figure  [ ds_poly ] ) . with few exceptions ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) most research to date on multirate filter banks",
    "has relied almost exclusively on mathematical tools from linear algebra and polynomial factorization ( notably the euclidean algorithm ) .",
    "the paper @xcite introduced group lifting structures and constructed examples for the two principal classes of linear phase filter banks  @xcite , the ws and hs classes exemplified in figure  [ ws - hs ] .",
    "a uniqueness theorem was proven for `` irreducible '' lifting factorizations generated by a group lifting structure that satisfies suitable hypotheses .",
    "the second paper @xcite showed that the ws and hs group lifting structures satisfy the hypotheses of the uniqueness theorem and therefore have irreducible group lifting factorizations that are either unique ( in the ws case ) or `` unique modulo rescaling '' ( in the hs case ) .",
    "these unique factorization results are significant because elementary matrix decompositions , including lifting factorizations , are highly nonunique in general .",
    "the original motivation for group lifting factorizations arose from the author s work on the iso / iec jpeg  2000 image coding standards  @xcite , which are based on subband coding using dwts ( or `` wavelet transformations '' in the language of  @xcite ) .",

    "* annex  g ) is devoted to the signaling and lifting implementation of ws filter banks .",
    "one consequence of the uniqueness theorem for ws group lifting factorizations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1 ) is that a ws filter bank can be specified in jpeg  2000 annex  g - compliant syntax in one and only one way ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary  1 ) .",
    "another consequence was disproving an assertion made in  @xcite that ws filter banks whose filters differ in length by two ( the mimimal amount for this class ) always have lifting factorizations using first - order hs ( type  ii ) linear phase lifting filters . a consequence of the uniqueness theorem for hs group lifting factorizations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 ) is that there exist many hs filter banks , including the example filter banks in annexes  h.4.1.2.1 and h.4.1.2.2 of  @xcite , that _ can not _ be lifted from the haar filter bank , @xmath15 using _ whole - sample antisymmetric _ ( wa , or type  iii ) linear phase lifting filters .",
    "further motivation for group lifting factorizations is provided by the present paper , which shows that the theory developed in @xcite allows one to characterize both classes of linear phase filter banks in group - theoretic terms .",
    "this means we can describe the structure of the ws class , whose polyphase matrices form a group , in terms of standard group - theoretic constructs involving the building blocks of lifting factorization : upper and lower triangular lifting matrix groups and a group of diagonal gain - scaling matrices . abstract algebra has provided valuable tools in other branches of signal processing , notably the application of finite ( galois ) fields to channel coding , and the author hopes that the group - theoretic perspective will provide useful and practical insights into subband coding .",

    "prop : additivityimpliescommutativity ] let the multiplicative group @xmath408 be closed under addition . if there exists a multiplicative homomorphism that also satisfies ( [ scaling_add ] ) for all @xmath424 and @xmath425 then @xmath2 is abelian .",
    "[ [ remarks-5 ] ] remarks + + + + + + +    for any nonabelian group @xmath2 , a multiplicative homomorphism automatically satisfies ( [ scaling_homo ] ) , ( [ scaling_composition ] ) , and ( [ scaling_identity ] ) . in the language of abstract algebra , however , proposition  [ prop : additivityimpliescommutativity ] says there is no such thing as a `` nonabelian module '' that also satisfies ( [ scaling_add ] ) .",
    "let @xmath426 . since @xmath408 is also closed under addition , @xmath427 .",
    "the homomorphism @xmath82 maps 1 to the identity automorphism @xmath428 so ( [ scaling_add ] ) implies @xmath429 and @xmath430 on the other hand , @xmath431 and ( [ scaling_add_consequence1 ] ) imply that @xmath432 equate ( [ scaling_add_consequence2 ] ) and ( [ scaling_add_consequence3 ] ) and cancel common factors : @xmath433    since scaled lifting groups are nonabelian , ( [ scaling_add ] ) fails for _ any _ automorphic scaling operation .",
    "we have thus shown that has a scaling structure that is _ partially _ homomorphic to scalar multiplication in vector spaces .",
    "this phenomenon has precedent , and other continuous groups with scaling automorphisms have been studied in the literature .",
    "for instance , _ homogeneous groups _",
    "@xcite are nilpotent lie groups equipped with dilations ( families of automorphisms @xmath434 , that act as dilations on local coordinates for the group ) .",
    "the class of homogeneous groups , which includes the heisenberg group , has attracted attention because of its close connections to harmonic analysis , mathematical physics , and partial differential equations .",
    "unfortunately , scaled lifting groups of the form @xmath435 are not nilpotent , so we leave the connection between scaled lifting groups and other continuous groups - with - dilations as an open question .",
    "the growing importance of multirate filter banks in digital communication standards , combined with the fact that filter banks do not form vector spaces , has convinced the author that a better understanding of the field can be gained by employing some well - established tools from algebraic group theory .",
    "the structure theory derived here for groups of linear phase filter banks provides a mathematical framework containing homomorphic analogues of many familiar linear algebraic properties .",
    "it is hoped that the detailed parameterizations of linear phase filter banks described in this paper will prove useful for filter bank designs based on parametric numerical optimization since the above classification is both complete and injective ; i.e. , a given filter bank is not encountered at multiple points in parameter space by optimization algorithms .",
    "the lifting cascade group and scaled lifting group generated by a @xmath0-invariant , order - increasing group lifting structure , @xmath436 , have been determined up to isomorphism in terms of the building blocks @xmath437 and @xmath0 . the unique factorization theorem for @xmath0-invariant ,",
    "order - increasing group lifting structures in @xcite implies that the lifting cascade group @xmath180 is isomorphic to the free product , @xmath260 , of the abelian lifting matrix groups @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( theorem  [ thm : cascade ] ) .",
    "it is shown that @xmath1 is a free group if and only if @xmath70 and @xmath71 are infinite cyclic groups and @xmath261 ( theorem  [ thm : freecascadegroup ] ) .",
    "when @xmath74 is @xmath0-invariant and order - increasing it has also been shown that the scaled lifting group @xmath336 is given by the internal semidirect product of @xmath1 by @xmath0 ( theorem  [ thm : semidirect ] ) .",
    "this result is proven in a relatively simple way directly from the @xmath0-invariance and order - increasing hypotheses without explicitly invoking uniqueness of irreducible group lifting factorizations .",
    "combining theorems  [ thm : cascade ] and  [ thm : semidirect ] characterizes @xmath0-invariant , order - increasing scaled lifting groups up to isomorphism in terms of @xmath437 and @xmath0 ( corollary  [ cor : s_structure ] ) : @xmath438 this result applies to the group @xmath4 of unimodular whole - sample symmetric filter banks specified in jpeg  2000 part  2 annex  g ( corollary  [ cor : ws_classification ] ) .",
    "it also applies to the scaled lifting group @xmath365 for the unimodular half - sample symmetric class , @xmath5 .",
    "while @xmath5 does _ not _ form a group it can be partitioned into cosets of either @xmath365 or @xmath364 ( corollary  [ cor : hs_classification ] ) .",
    "homomorphic comparisons are made between basis expansions in vector spaces and the unique factorization structure of scaled lifting groups for @xmath0-invariant , order - increasing group lifting structures .",
    "it is shown that such scaled lifting groups can be regarded as noncommutative multiplicative analogues of vector spaces .",

    "<S> the associated scaled lifting group @xmath2 is the semidirect product of @xmath1 by the diagonal gain scaling matrix group @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these results apply to the group lifting structures for the two principal classes of linear phase perfect reconstruction filter banks , the whole- and half - sample symmetric classes . </S>",
    "<S> since the unimodular whole - sample symmetric class forms a group , @xmath3 , that is in fact equal to its own scaled lifting group , @xmath4 , the results of this paper characterize the group - theoretic structure of @xmath3 up to isomorphism . </S>",
    "<S> although the half - sample symmetric class @xmath5 does not form a group , it can be partitioned into cosets of its lifting cascade group , @xmath6 , or , alternatively , into cosets of its scaled lifting group , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> homomorphic comparisons reveal that scaled lifting groups covered by the results in this paper have a structure analogous to a `` noncommutative vector space . ''    </S>",
