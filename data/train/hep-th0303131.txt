    "it has recently been argued that there might exist some extra spatial dimensions , not in the traditional kaluza - klein ( kk ) scheme @xcite where extra dimensions are compactified on a radius of the order of planck scale , but in a scenario where they could be large .",
    "certainly , the extra dimensions idea is not completely new but it is also related to string theories . among the existing models the ten - dimensional @xmath0 heterotic string theory seems to be the most acceptable candidate to describe our world .",
    "this theory is related to an 11-dimensional spacetime , where the 11th dimension is compactified via a @xmath1 orbifold symmetry . in this setup the standard model particles",
    "are confined to a four - dimensional spacetime , while the gravitons propagate in full spacetime .",
    "large extra dimensions were also recalled to solve the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "however , it was the work of randall and sundrum @xcite which suscitated a renewed interest on these grounds . in this model our world",
    "is identified with a domain wall in five - dimensional anti de sitter ( ads ) spacetime . in their first paper ,",
    "randall and sundrum proposed a mechanism to solve the hierarchy problem by a small extra dimension , while in their second paper , the braneworld with a positive tension was investigated .",
    "in this paper we consider a six - dimensional model where the bulk contains a singularity and is bounded by a four - dimensional brane containing matter .",
    "this brane is a thick brane with the usual three infinite spatial directions and an additional coordinate compactified in a small radius that can be of planck size like in the kk models @xcite or even of submilimetric size as in the arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) models @xcite , which makes it unavailable to the brane observers . in this way",
    ", this `` effective '' picture corresponds to our universe .",
    "the static case has been already studied in @xcite where ads - schwarzschild and ads - reissner - nordstrm embeddings were considered .",
    "the case of domain walls moving in bulks containing non - charged singularities has also been studied in @xcite .",
    "brane models in ads space with schwarzschild singularities have been used to understand the ads / cft correspondence and look like promising theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the motivation for a six - dimensional model comes from the fact that spacetimes with more than one extra dimension can allow for solutions with more appealing features , particularly in spacetimes where the curvature of the internal space is non - zero .",
    "more extra dimensions also relax the fine - tunnings of the fundamental parameters .",
    "on the other hand , the add model @xcite , which relates the planck mass to the fundamental mass in @xmath2 dimensions through the size of the transverse dimensions , foresees the existence of @xmath3 extra dimensions .",
    "the possibility @xmath4 remains excluded from experimental bounds since there are no observed violations of the newton s law at distances of the order of the solar system .",
    "according to the model , photons are confined to the brane and gravitons can propagate in all five spatial directions , then there is a possibility that gravitational fields while propagating out of the brane speed up due to the warped bulk geometry reaching farther distances in smaller time than light propagating inside the brane , a scenario that for a resident of the brane ( as ourselves ) implies shortcuts @xcite .",
    "the existence of shortcuts implies that causality is violated from the point of view of a four - dimensional observer ; however , it is perfectly defined through @xmath5-dimensional geodesics for an observer in the bulk .",
    "thus , two points apparently causally disconnected in four dimensions could be causally connected by gravitational shortcuts .",
    "this fact accounts for a possible solution of the horizon problem . as it was pointed out in @xcite , if high redshifts were available , shortcuts appearing before nucleosynthesis are serious mediators of homogenization of the matter on the brane and then they could provide an explanation alternative to inflation to this problem .",
    "other alternative approaches have also considered a varying speed of light @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if inflation took part on the brane , the causal structure is definitely changed by shortcuts possibly leading to a non - usual period of causal evolution of scales , what could be responsible for distinct predictions in the cosmic microwave background structure for inflationary models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the six - dimensional model considered along this work , derive the equation system governing the brane motion from the point of view of a bulk observer and write the geodesic equation corresponding to the shortest graviton path in the bulk as well as the expression for the delay between graviton and photon flight times .",
    "section 3 is devoted to studying the brane behaviour when its position is perturbed about a fixed point . in section 4",
    "we provide the solutions of geodesic equation and brane equation of motion in the different scenarios resulting from the combination of the parameters appearing in the model and show the existence of several shortcuts .",
    "we also find the time delay and the ratio between the horizons subtended by gravitons and photons .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in section 5 .",
    "we consider a six - dimensional model described by the following metric @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the metric of the three - dimensional spatial sections with @xmath8 corresponding to a hyperbolic , a flat and an elliptic space , respectively .",
    "the matter content on the brane is directly related to the jump of the extrinsic curvature tensor across the brane @xcite .",
    "this relation has been derived in the case of a static brane in a previous work @xcite .",
    "here we generalize our result for the israel conditions to include the case of a brane moving with respect to the coordinate system .",
    "its position at any bulk time @xmath9 will be denoted by @xmath10    the extrinsic curvature tensor on the brane is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a unit vector field normal to the brane worldsheet and @xmath13 is the induced metric on the brane .    in order to compute the components of @xmath12",
    ", we use the relations @xmath14 where we have introduced the unit velocity vector corresponding to the brane , which reads @xmath15    the relation between @xmath16 ( the bulk time ) and @xmath17 ( the brane time ) can be found from the induced metric , @xmath18 dt^2 + a^2(t,{\\cal r}(t ) ) d\\sigma^2 _ { ( 4 ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -d\\tau^2 + a^2 ( \\tau ) d\\sigma^2 _ { ( 4 ) } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a dot means derivative with respect to the bulk time @xmath9 .",
    "we obtain @xmath19 thus , ( [ u ] ) can be written as @xmath20 and from ( [ rel ] ) we can easily obtain @xmath21    now we can calculate the components of the extrinsic curvature tensor by substituting ( [ ntilde ] ) into ( [ excurv ] ) .",
    "the non - zero components are @xmath22 where all the coefficients take values on the brane .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor on the brane located at @xmath23 can be written as @xmath24 we also define a tensor @xmath25 as @xmath26    the israel junction conditions @xcite are given by @xmath27 = -\\kappa_{(6 ) } ^2 \\hat t_{\\mu\\nu } \\",

    "this is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 ( @xmath37 being the cosmological constant , which can be positive or negative ) and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are constants .",
    "we should stress that @xmath40 can be written as @xmath41 , with @xmath42 an angle with the usual periodicity @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the coordinate @xmath44 is compactified under some mechanism such that its radius of compactification @xmath45 is small enough to evade experimental detection @xcite .",
    "this makes the local observers have the picture of living on an effective three - dimensional brane .",
    "metric ( [ bhmetric ] ) contains a singularity located at @xmath46 .",
    "it is valid on the @xmath47 parts of surfaces of constant @xmath9 and its reflection , by the @xmath1 orbifold symmetry , is valid on the @xmath48 parts . if @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then ( [ bhmetric ] ) is simply the metric of de sitter or anti de sitter spacetime according to the sign of @xmath51 .    with this ansatz the israel conditions ( [ israel ] )",
    "reduce to only two equations , which read as @xmath52 where again all the metric coefficients must be evaluated on the brane . system ( [ brem ] ) describes the full nonlinear dynamics of the brane embedded in the static bulk ( [ bhmetric ] ) .",
    "we consider two points on the brane @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "in general there are more than one null geodesic connecting these points in the @xmath55 spacetime .",
    "the trajectories of photons must be on the brane and those of gravitons may be outside .",
    "the graviton path is defined equating ( [ bhmetric ] ) to zero .",
    "since we are looking for a path that minimizes @xmath9 when the final point @xmath54 is on the brane , the problem reduces to an euler - lagrange problem @xcite .",
    "then as in @xcite the shortest graviton path is given by @xmath56    we can also calculate the time delay between the photon travelling on the brane and the gravitons travelling in the bulk .",
    "since both signals cover the same distance @xcite , @xmath57 the difference between photon and graviton flight times measured by an observer on the brane can approximately be written in terms of the bulk time @xmath9 as @xcite @xmath58    it is also interesting to look at the ratio between the horizons subtended by the photons travelling on the brane and the gravitons travelling in the bulk .",
    "this ratio uses the same quantities previously quoted for the time delay , @xmath59",
    "in this section we study perturbatively the brane behaviour at a fixed point .",
    "we define the background solution as the case where the brane position is frozen , _",
    "@xmath60 then the system ( [ brem ] ) reduces to @xmath61    the equations of motion for the brane fluctuations can be obtained linearizing the exact equations of motion ( [ brem ] ) about the `` equilibrium '' configuration .",
    "they read as @xmath62 from the explicit expressions of @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 we can find @xmath66 as we can see from ( [ system ] ) , the brane fluctuations are bound to the matter fluctuations .",
    "however , when we have the case of adiabatic matter fluctuations @xmath67 we can derive an equation for the brane fluctuations with an appropriate linear combination of ( [ system ] ) @xmath68 while the matter fluctuations will be related to the brane ones by @xmath69 assuming an equation of state @xmath70 , ( [ fluctuation ] ) finally reads @xmath71 the constant @xmath38 can be expressed in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath73 from the israel conditions for a static brane @xcite as @xmath74    in the case of a flat domain wall ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) , the term inside braces in ( [ fluc ] ) can be interpreted as an effective cosmological constant on the brane , @xmath77 which vanishes when we take into account ( [ lineara ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the randall - sundrum condition @xcite in six dimensions .",
    "then , the effective cosmological constant on the brane is zero .",
    "therefore , we are left with the equation of motion for a free scalar field as in five dimensions @xcite . in this case",
    "the brane is at rest and the equilibrium position @xmath72 can be chosen arbitrarily . however , a small departure from this position results in a runaway behaviour .",
    "this result is compatible with the numerical solution of the full nonlinear system ( [ brem ] ) as we will see in the next section .",
    "the system ( [ brem ] ) describing the brane dynamics can be numerically solved for several combinations of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath79 and @xmath51 . when @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath79 vanish , the solution for @xmath80 is a constant or a linear function in @xmath9 depending on the given initial condition for @xmath81 , and we verify the behaviour found through brane fluctuations .    for @xmath38 and @xmath39 non - zero we have solved ( [ brem ] ) in the typical cases of a domain wall ( @xmath82 ) , matter ( @xmath83 ) and radiation ( @xmath84 ) dominated branes . in figure",

    "we have also calculated the time delays and the ratio between graviton and photon horizons for the examples of shortcuts appearing in this paper , these are shown in table [ td ] together with the graviton bulk flight time and its corresponding brane time according to the equation ( [ dtdtau ] ) .",
    "we have classified all cases according to the sign of the @xmath38 parameter and to whether we are in ds or ads bulks .",

    "the fact that shortcuts are abundant in the studied setups lends further support to the idea of solving the horizon problem via thermalization by graviton exchange @xcite ; however , we should stress that this is not a proof of the solution of the problem yet ."
