    "dna polymerase ( dnap ) replicates a dna molecule ; the sequence of the nucleotides , the monomeric subunit of dna , on the product of polymerization is dictated by that on the corresponding template dna through the watson - crick complimentary base - paring rule @xcite .",
    "dnap moves step - by - step along the template strand utilizing chemical energy input and , therefore , these are also regarded as a molecular motor @xcite .",
    "an unique feature of dnap is that it is a dual - purpose enzyme that plays two opposite roles in two different circumstances during dna replication .",
    "it plays its normal role as a polymerase catalyzing the _ elongation _ of a new dna molecule .",
    "however , upon committing an error by the misincorporation of a wrong nucleotide , it switches its role to that of a exonuclease catalyzing the _ shortening _ of the nascent dna by cleavage of the misincorporated nucleotide at the growing tip of the elongating dna @xcite .",
    "the two distinct sites on the dnap where , respectively , polymerization and cleavage are catalyzed , are separated by 3 - 4 nm @xcite .",
    "the nascent dna is transferred back to the site of polymerization after cleaving the incorrect nucleotide from its growing tip .",
    "the elongation and cleavage reactions are thus _ coupled _ by the transfer of the dna between the sites of polymerase and exonuclease activity of the dnap .",
    "however , the physical mechanism of this transfer is not well understood @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop a minimal kinetic model of dna replication ( more precisely , that of the `` leading strand '' which can proceed continuously ) that captures the coupled polymerase and exonuclease activities of a dnap within the same theoretical framework . from this model ,",
    "we derive the exact analytical expressions for ( i ) the dwell time distribution ( dtd ) of the dnap at the successive nucleotides on the template dna , and ( ii ) the distribution of the turnover times ( dtt ) of the exonuclease ( i.e. , the time intervals between the successive events of cleavage of misincorporated nucleotide from the nascent dna ) .",
    "the mean of these two distributions characterize the average rates of elongation and cleavage , repectively ; we show that both can be written as michaelis - menten - like expressions for enzymatic reactions which reveals the effect of coupling explicitly .    in our model ,",
    "the kinetic pathways available to the correct and incorrect nucleotides are the same .",
    "however , it is the ratio of the rate constants that makes a pathway more favorable to one species than to the other .",
    "similar assumption was made by galas and branscomb @xcite in one of the earliest models of replication .",
    "therefore , in spite of the elaborate quality control system , some misincorporated nucleotides can escape cleavage ; such _ replication error _ in the final product is usually about @xmath0 in @xmath1 nucleotides .",
    "moreover , occasionally a correct nucleotide is erroneously cleaved unneccessarily ; such `` futile '' cycles slow down replication @xcite .",
    "we define quantitative measures of these two types of error and derive their exact analytical expressions from our model for `` wild type '' dnap . using special cases of these analytical expressions",
    ", we also examine the effects of two different mutations of the dnap @xcite- ( i ) `` exo - deficient '' mutant that is incapable of exonuclease activity , and ( ii ) `` transfer - deficient '' mutant on which the rate of transfer to the exonuclease site is drastically reduced .",
    "almost all dnap share a common `` right - hand - like '' structure .",
    "binding of the correct dntp substrate triggers closing of the `` hand '' which is required for the formation of the diester bond between the recruited nucleotide monomer and the elongating dna molecule .",
    "the kinetic scheme of our stochastic model of replication is shown in fig ( [ fig-3state ] ) .",
    "the rate constants for the correct and incorrect nucleotides are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively ; the same subscript is used in both the cases for the same transition .",
    "( see the text for details ) . ]",
    "let us begin with the situation where the dnap is ready to begin its next elongation cycle ; these mechano - chemical state is labelled by the integer index @xmath0 . in principle",
    ", the transition @xmath4 consists of two steps : binding of the dntp substrate and the formation of the diester bond .",
    "the overall rate of this step is @xmath5 for a correct substrate and @xmath6 for an incorrect substrate .    occasionally , because of the random fluctuation of the `` hand '' between the `` open '' and `` closed '' conformations , the dntp may escape even before the formation of the diester bond ; this takes place with the rate constant @xmath7 .",
    "if the recruited dntp is incorrect , the hand remains `` open '' most of the time and the rate constant for the rejection of the dntp is @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "note that dntp selection through @xmath10 involves a discrimination between the correct and incorrect dntp substrate on the basis of free energy gained by complementary base - pairing with the template .",
    "the transition @xmath11 corresponds to the _ relaxation _ of the freshly incorporated nucleotide to a conformation that allows the dnap to be ready for the next cycle .",
    "the rate constants for this step are @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , for correctly and incorrectly incorporated nucleotides . alternatively , while in the state @xmath14 , the dnap can transfer the growing dna molecule to its exonuclease site ; this transfer takes place at a rate @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) if the selected nucleotide is correct ( incorrect ) . since @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , the misincorporated nucleotide",
    "most often gets transferred to the exonuclease site whereas relaxation , rather than transfer , is the most probable pathway when the incorporated nucleotide is correct .",
    "the actual cleavage of the diester bond that severs the nucleotide at the growing tip of the dna is represented by the transition @xmath19 . for a correct nucleotide , @xmath20 indicating that the dna is likely to be transferred back to the polymerase site without the unneccesary cleavage of the correct nucleotide .",
    "in contrast , for an incorrect nucleotide , @xmath21 which makes error correction a highly probable event . moreover , @xmath22 .    since the trimmed dna is transferred to the polymerase site extremely rapidly @xcite , each of the rate constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 incorporate both the trimming and transfer .",
    "interestingly , the full kinetic scheme in fig.[fig-3state ] can be viewed as a _ coupling _ of a purely polymerase - catalyzed reaction ( shown in the left panel of fig.[fig - mmlikep ] ) and a purely exonuclease - catalyzed reaction ( shown in the right panel of fig.[fig - mmlikep ] ) ; the transition with the rate @xmath25 couples these two reactions .",
    "strictly speaking , for an `` exo - deficient '' dnap @xcite , @xmath26 although the rates of forward and reverse transfer between the sites of polymerase and exonuclease activities may not be necessarily negligible .",
    "similarly , either @xmath27 , or @xmath28 ( or , both ) can be the cause of `` transfer - deficiency '' of the dnap .",
    "the dtd considered here arises from intrinsic stochasticity and not caused by any sequence inhomogeneity of the mrna template @xcite . for a molecular motor that is allowed to step backward as well as forward",
    ", we use positive ( @xmath29 ) and negative ( @xmath30 ) signs to represent the forward and backward steps , respectively .",
    "for example , @xmath31 is the _",
    "conditional _ dtd ( cdtd ) @xcite when a forward step is followed by a backward step and @xmath32 is the probability of such a transition .",
    "therefore , the dtd can be written as @xmath33 since in our model two consecutive backward steps are forbidden implies that @xmath34 .",
    "we calculate the cdtd following the standard method @xcite that has been used successfully earlier for the calculation of cdtd for some other motors ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath35 be the probability of finding the dnap in the @xmath36-th ( @xmath37 ) chemical state at the @xmath38-th site ( i.e. , at the discrete position @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "then master equations for @xmath35 are @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 in terms of the fourier transform @xmath44 of @xmath45 , the master equations can be written as a matrix equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a column vector whose 3 components are @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; @xmath52 being the step size , ie . ,",
    "@xmath53 .",
    "taking laplace transform of ( [ meq ] ) with respect to time @xmath54 the solution of the master equation in the fourier - laplace space is @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the column vector corresponding to the initial probabilities .",
    "now we define @xmath58 which can be calculated from @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the cofactors of the * r*(q , s ) .",
    "the determinant of the matrix * r*(q , s ) is a third order polynomial of @xmath61 and can be expressed as @xmath62 note that @xmath63 is independent of @xmath64 whereas @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the function of @xmath64 .",
    "for the explicit form ( [ eq - mq ] ) of @xmath67 the coefficients @xmath63 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are given below .",

    "@xmath84 and cdtd are related @xcite by the equation @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the vector of initial conditions .",
    "for example , @xmath87 corresponds to the given condition that the motor has taken the initial step in the forward ( + ) direction .",
    "thus , in principle , if one can calculate @xmath84 , one can use the relation ( [ m20 ] ) to solve for @xmath82 and , then taking inverse laplace transform , obtained @xmath83 . to calculate @xmath84 ,",

    "we start the clock by setting it to @xmath91 when the dnap reaches the state @xmath92 at @xmath38 from state @xmath0 at @xmath93 . therefore , in this case @xmath94 .",

    "the fundamental questions we have addressed here in the context of dna replication have not been addressed by earlier theoretical works @xcite .",
    "the effects of tension on the polymerase and exonuclease activities , which have been the main focus of the earlier works @xcite , will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of error correction by dnap is somewhat different from the mechanism of transcriptional proofreading which is intimately coupled to `` back tracking '' of the rna polymerase @xcite .",
    "we have derived exact analytical formulae for the cdtd and dtt which will be very useful in analyzing experimental data in single dnap biophysics , particularly its stepping patterns and enzymatic turnover . in spite of their coupling , the average rates of both the enzymatic activities are mm - like ; the analytical expressions for the effective mm parameters explicitly display the nature of the coupling of the two kinetic processes .",
