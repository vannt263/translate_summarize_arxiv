    "stability analysis of uncertain dynamical systems or , precisely speaking , dynamical systems with tine - invariant and uncertain parameters , has attracted extensive attention for a long time in systems and control theory . in particular , for the stability analysis of uncertain linear systems , there have been proposed various tools including generalized kharitonov s theorem  @xcite , common quadratic lyapunov functions  @xcite , parameter - dependent quadratic lyapunov functions  @xcite , and parameter - dependent polynomial lyapunov functions  @xcite . for positive linear systems , which are the class of linear systems whose state variable is nonnegative entrywise provided the initial state is , the authors in @xcite and @xcite propose robust stability conditions based on diagonal lyapunov functions  @xcite and linear storage functions , respectively .",
    "all the works mentioned above model the uncertainty of a linear system by providing a set of all possible configurations of the system .",
    "this is done typically via polytopes where coefficient matrices of the system can belong to .",
    "we can find in the literature several contribution to determine whether the uncertain system is stable for all possible configurations or not .",
    "an important consequence is that , in these frameworks , all possible system configurations are equally important .",
    "however , in some applications , we are able to give not only the set of possible uncertain parameters but also a weight , typically a probability distribution , that measures the relative importance of the elements in the uncertainty set .    one of the earliest works along this line is presented in  @xcite , where the authors analyze the stability of linear time - invariant systems whose coefficient matrices are modeled via a random vector . using first- and second - order reliability methods  @xcite , the authors analyze the stability of specific mechanical systems , and also study the probability of the system being stable with respect to physical parameters , such as stiffness and damping ratio .",
    "they also compare various control strategies such as those based on linear quadratic regulator and kalman filters .",
    "however , their results are limited to the analysis of low - order systems and can not be easily generalized to the case of possibly large networks composed by uncertain systems .    in this paper , we present a robust stability analysis for networks of positive linear systems subject to time - invariant and random uncertainty .",
    "we first present linear matrix inequalities for checking if a given network of uncertain positive linear systems is stable with a given probability and a decay rate .",
    "based on this result , we then present a convex optimization problem , posed as a geometric program  @xcite , for optimally designing the parameters of the probability distribution expressing the uncertainty .",
    "we illustrate the obtained results using a networked susceptible - infected - susceptible epidemic model  @xcite , which has found applications in , for example , public health  @xcite , malware spreading  @xcite , and information propagation over socio - technical networks  @xcite .",
    "the results in this paper are based on the probabilistic estimate  @xcite for the maximum real eigenvalue of random and symmetric matrices .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after introducing necessary notations , in section  [ sec : problemformulation ]",
    "we introduce our model of the network of uncertain positive linear systems and then state the problems to be studied .",
    "we then propose a convex optimization framework for analyzing the stability of random networks in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "based on this analysis , we study the optimal design of the probability distributions describing uncertainties in section  [ sec : design ] .",

    "the design framework proposed in this paper depends on a class of optimization problems called geometric programs  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath32 , @xmath16 , @xmath33 denote positive variables and define @xmath34 .",

    "in this section , we introduce the model of the network of linear systems with stochastic uncertainty .",

    "we emphasize that @xmath50 is a linear time - invariant system for each realization of the random matrices @xmath47 .",
    "in other words , the coefficient matrices of @xmath50 do not change over time once they are chosen from the corresponding distributions .",
    "if we introduce the notations @xmath51 then , from , we obtain the random linear time - invariant system @xmath52 following the deterministic case  @xcite , we say that @xmath53 is _ positive _ if @xmath54 implies @xmath55 for every @xmath56 with probability one .",
    "the first problem we address in this paper is the following stability analysis problem with a prescribed decay rate and an unreliability level :    given a desired decay rate @xmath57 and an unreliability level  @xmath58 $ ] , determine if , with probability at least @xmath59 , the system @xmath53 is stable with decay rate @xmath60 .",
    "we also investigate design problems .",
    "we assume that , though we can not tune the values of the random variables  @xmath47 directly , we can still design their probability distributions .",
    "specifically , we assume that the probability distributions of the random matrices @xmath47 are parametrized by scalar parameters @xmath61 , @xmath16 , @xmath62 that we can design .",
    "our design problem is based on cost functions and constraints .",
    "we suppose that there exists a function @xmath63 that represents the cost for realizing the specific parameter @xmath64 and from allowing the unreliability level  @xmath65 . also , for functions @xmath66 , @xmath16 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath16 , @xmath69 of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we allow the constraints on @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the form @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
