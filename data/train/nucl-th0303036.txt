    "the concept of a possible thermal origin of charmonia was initially introduced @xcite to explain the measurement of the j/@xmath1/hadron ratio in nuclear collisions .",
    "because of their large mass and small production cross section at thermal energies charm quarks are , however , not likely to be thermally produced .",
    "on the other hand , significant production of charm quark pairs takes place in initial hard collisions .",
    "this led to the idea of statistical hadronization of charm quarks @xcite , which has sparked an intense activity in this field @xcite . at about the same time",
    "an independent effort @xcite based on a kinetic model has been developed to study charm production in heavy ion collisions at collider energies .",
    "initial interest focussed on the available sps data on @xmath0 production in pb ",
    "pb collisions .",
    "as we stress below , these data can indeed be described within the statistical approach , but only when assuming the charm production cross section to be enhanced beyond the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions .    the largest differences between the results of the statistical coalescence scenario and earlier models are expected at collider energies . for example , for central au - au collision at rhic energy ,",
    "matsui approach @xcite predicts a very strong ( up to a factor of 20 @xcite ) suppression of @xmath0 yields as compared to a direct production . in the present approach this suppression",
    "is overcome by statistical recombination of @xmath0 mesons from the initially produced @xmath2 pairs , so that much larger yields are expected .",
    "suppression at rhic energy is also predicted by the kinetic model @xcite .",
    "] we therefore focus in this letter on the predictions of the model for open and hidden charm meson yields at rhic ( au  au ) and lhc ( pb  pb ) energies , with particular emphasis on the centrality dependence of rapidity densities at rhic .",
    "we , furthermore , present predictions for the energy dependence of the production of hadrons with open and hidden charm .",
    "the model assumes that all charm quarks are produced in primary hard collisions and equilibrate in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "in particular , no @xmath0 mesons are preformed in the qgp , implying complete color screening @xcite .",
    "there are indications from recent lattice qcd calculations that , already at sps energies , j/@xmath1 mesons can be dissociated in a deconfined medium via collisions with thermal gluons @xcite .",
    "as noted earlier @xcite , the cross sections of charmed hadrons are too small to allow for their chemical equilibration in a hadronic gas .",
    "we assume that open and hidden charm hadrons are formed at chemical freeze - out according to statistical laws .",
    "consistent with the fact that , at sps energy and beyond , chemical freeze - out appears to be at the phase boundary @xcite , our model implies that a qgp phase was a stage in the evolution of the fireball .",
    "the analysis of @xmath0 spectra at sps @xcite lends further support to the statistical hadronization picture where @xmath0 decouples at chemical freeze - out . a recent analysis of electron spectra at rhic",
    "@xcite also strenghtens the case for an early thermalization of heavy quarks .",
    "however , in that analysis it was pointed out that both the hydrodynamical approach and pythia reproduce the measured single - electron spectra .",
    "as suggested meanwhile @xcite , the measurement of the elliptic flow ( @xmath3 ) of open charm hadrons and @xmath0 may help to disentangle the two scenarios .",
    "recent work @xcite in extracting the quark @xmath3 from the one of hadrons may help towards this goal .",
    "most important though , in our view , is a high - precision direct measurement of open charm . as expected , and as seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath4 spectra predicted by pythia and hydro are different in detail at low @xmath4 and differ manifestly at high @xmath4 ( @xmath5 mass of charm quark ) . on the other hand , a recent theoretical analysis @xcite indicates that charm quarks might not thermalize quickly because of their large mass .    in statistical models",
    "charm production needs generally to be treated within the framework of canonical thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , the charm balance equation required @xcite during hadronization is expressed as : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the number of directly produced @xmath8 pairs and @xmath9 are modified bessel functions . in the fireball of volume @xmath10 the total number of open @xmath11 and hidden @xmath12",
    "charm hadrons are computed from their grand - canonical densities @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . the densities of different particle species in the grand canonical ensemble are calculated following the statistical model introduced in @xcite . all known charmed mesons and hyperons and their decays @xcite have to be included in the calculations .",
    "the balance equation ( [ aa : eq1 ] ) defines a fugacity parameter @xmath15 that accounts for deviations of charm multiplicity from the value that is expected in complete chemical equilibrium .",
    "the yield of open charm mesons and hyperons @xmath16 and of charmonia @xmath17 is obtained from : @xmath18 the above model for charm production and hadronization can be only used @xcite if the number of participating nucleons @xmath19 is sufficiently large .",
    "taking into account the measured dependence of the relative yield of @xmath20 to @xmath0 on centrality @xcite in pb ",
    "pb collisions at sps energy the model appears appropriate @xcite if @xmath21100 .    to calculate the yields of open and hidden charm hadrons for a given centrality and collision energy one needs to fix a set of parameters in eq.(1 ) and ( 2 ) :",
    "\\i ) a constant temperature of 170 mev and a baryonic chemical potential @xmath22 according to the parametrization @xmath23/(1+\\sqrt{s_{nn}}[{\\rm gev}]/4.3)$ ] @xcite are used for our calculations . for sps and rhic energies these thermal parameters",
    "are consistent , within statistical errors , with those required to describe experimental data on different hadron yields @xcite . in table",
    "[ aa : tab0 ] we present the values of these input parameters and the resulting chemical potentials for isospin , strangeness and charmness for the canonical ensemble calculations at sps , rhic and lhc .",
    ".input values of @xmath24 and @xmath22 and output chemical potentials for isospin , strangeness and charmness for canonical ensemble calculations at sps , rhic and lhc .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the apparent weak dependence of @xmath0 yield on freeze - out temperature , seen in fig .",
    "[ aa : fig3 ] , may be surprising .",
    "this is particularly the case since in the thermal model considered in @xcite this dependence was shown to be very strong . in our model",
    "this result is a consequence of the charm balance equation ( [ aa : eq2 ] ) .",
    "the temperature variation leads , obviously , to a different number of thermally produced charmed hadrons as in @xcite , but this is compensated by the @xmath15 factor .",
    "the approximate temperature dependence of @xmath15 and the @xmath0 yield are : @xmath25 as a result of the small mass difference in the exponent the @xmath0 yield exhibits only a weak sensitivity on @xmath24 .",
    "this is in contrast to the purely thermal case where the yield scales with @xmath26 .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ aa : tab3 ] , where we present the number of @xmath0 and @xmath27 mesons produced thermally ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ) and within the frame of our statistical hadronization model .",
    "also shown are the values of @xmath15 and the yield ratio @xmath30 for three different values of @xmath24 .",
    "the compensations are evident in the last column of table  [ aa : tab3 ] , where ratios for the two extreme temperatures are calculated .",
    "the only exception is the ratio @xmath30 , which is obviously identical in the statistical hadronization scenario and in the thermal model and coincides , for t@xmath31170 mev , with the measured value at sps @xcite .",
    "mesons at rhic for different rapidity window sizes .",
    "the lines are calculations , the dots are experimental data from phenix collaboration @xcite ( the point for the central collisions is the upper limit for 90% c.l . ) . ]",
    "most of our results presented above are obtained considering a one unit rapidity window at midrapidity , while results for the full volume were presented only for the sps .",
    "unlike the kinetic model of thews et al .",
    "@xcite , our model does not contain dynamical aspects of the coalescence process .",
    "however , in our approach , the width of the rapidity window does influence the results in the canonical regime .",
    "for the grand - canonical case , attained only at lhc energy , there is no dependence on the width of the rapidity window , due to a simple cancellation between the variation of the volume , proportional to the rapidity slice in case of a flat rapidity distribution , and the variation of @xmath7 , also proportional to the width of the rapidity slice . in fig .",
    "[ aa : fig4 ] we present the centrality dependence of @xmath0 rapidity densities for rhic energy and for different rapidity windows @xmath32y from 0.5 to 3 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath32y resembles that of the kinetic model @xcite , but is less pronounced .",
    "the available data are not yet precise enough to rule out any of the scenarios considered . however , for the kinetic model @xcite , the cases of small @xmath32y seem to be ruled out by the present phenix data .",
    "we stress in this context that the size of @xmath32y window has a potentially large impact on the results at sps energy .",
    "it is conceivable that no charm enhancement is needed to explain the data if one considers a sufficiently narrow rapidity window for the statistical hadronization .",
    "the results presented above were obtained under the assumption of statistical hadronization of quarks and gluons .",
    "in addition , for charm quarks the yields were constrained by the charm balance equation that was formulated in the canonical ensemble .",
    "we have further assumed that charm quarks are entirely produced via primary hard scattering and thermalized in the qgp .",
    "no secondary production of charm in the initial and final state was included in our calculations .",
    "final state effects like nuclear absorption of @xmath0 @xcite are also neglected .",
    "we have demonstrated that the statistical coalescence approach yields a good description of the measured centrality dependence of @xmath0 production at sps energy , albeit with a charm cross section increased by a factor of 2.8 compared to current nlo perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "rapidity densities for open and hidden charm mesons are predicted to increase strongly with energy , with striking changes in centrality dependence .",
    "first rhic data on @xmath0 production support the current predictions , although the experimental errors are for the moment too large to allow firm conclusions .",
    "we emphasize that the predictive power of our model relies heavily on the accuracy of the charm cross section , not yet measured in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the statistical coalescence implies travel of charm quarks over significant distances e.g. in a qgp .",
    "if the model predictions will describe consistently precision data this would be a clear signal for the presence of a deconfined phase .",
