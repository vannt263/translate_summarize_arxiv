    "for superconductivity both the electronic and the electron - phonon interactions are important . while for the bcs @xcite superconductors the electron - phonon contributions dominate , for the novel high - t@xmath4 materials the coulomb interactions play a key role",
    ". the eliashberg theory @xcite , being a generalization of migdal s theorem @xcite , is able to treat the electron - phonon interaction in both the weak and the strong coupling regime , but the electronic interactions are averaged to a single parameter , @xmath5 .",
    "this might be insufficient even for the strongly correlated systems @xcite . in this work",
    ", we focus on purely electronic interactions in the superconducting homogeneous gas for which the results obtained in last forty years still remain controversial .",
    "the existence of superconductivity at higher angular momentum pairing without phononic contributions was suggested by kohn and luttinger @xcite , in 1965 .",
    "the mechanism proposed there was based on the presence of the long - range oscillatory potential in ordinary space due to the sharpness of the fermi surface , and the fact that cooper pairs @xcite could form taking the advantage of the attractive regions .",
    "interestingly , some features of the phonon spectra have been explained due to friedel oscillations @xcite .",
    "more than twenty years ago , takada @xcite solved the eliashberg equations and estimated the transition temperature , @xmath6 , due to the plasmon exchange .",
    "his solution assumed weak electron - phonon coupling for which the kirzhnits , maksimov , khomskii approximation @xcite can be justified .",
    "other authors , rietschel and sham @xcite and shuh and sham @xcite , solved the strong coupling eliashberg equations linearized in the gap function .",
    "for the coulomb interactions , they also assumed the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite and found unrealistically high critical temperatures .",
    "later papers included vertex corrections yielding a counterpart for the plasmon exchange which overestimate the coulomb attraction .",
    "obtained this way , critical temperatures were much lower @xcite .    nowadays , we can use a standard solid state method , the density functional theory @xcite ( dft ) , generalized to the superconducting state ( scdft ) by oliveira , gross and kohn @xcite in 1988 .",
    "the formal framework , which we briefly describe in the next section , has been developed over more than ten years @xcite and extended for the relativistic superconductors @xcite .",
    "the first solutions of the scdft scheme for simple metals predicted the critical temperatures @xcite quite well , although the electronic correlations have been taken into account only by the thomas - fermi screening of the coulomb interaction .",
    "then , the semi - phenomenological correlation functional was constructed and tested , firstly for nb @xcite , and later for ybco @xcite using the eight - band model @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the local density approximation ( lda ) for superconductors was given by kurth _",
    "@xcite , in 1999 .",
    "the attempt to construct the exchange - correlation functional from _ first principles _ was made @xcite using as a starting point the rpa @xcite generalized to the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "the condensation energy of the homogeneous gas has been calculated within that scheme for the model pairing potential of s - type @xcite and no superconductivity has been found up to @xmath2=5 .    after the discovery of the anisotropic gaps in b2212 @xcite and ybco @xcite by the angular - resolved photo - emission experiments , it is interesting to look closer at the higher angular momentum channels within the scdft method .",
    "this is a step toward dft calculations for the superconducting state of high - t@xmath7 compounds .",
    "recently , the condensation energy for systems with the anisotropic gaps has been studied by haslinger and chubukov within the eliashberg theory adapted for the spin - fluctuation mediated pairing @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "the fact that , the model calculations based on results obtained for a homogeneous gas have been performed for strongly - correlated layered superconductors by kresin with co - workers @xcite and seibold @xcite , shows that our studies can contribute to understanding physics of complicated systems . the data for a homogeneous gas obtained with our code @xcite can also give basis for the parametrization of an lda functional for inhomogeneous superconductors in a similar philosophy as an ordinary lda is a parametrization @xcite of the quantum monte carlo data @xcite calculated for a representative set of @xmath2 ( wigner radius ) values .",

    "actually for the same reason , the condensation energy at @xmath42=10 for the d - wave pairing could be negative ( because it is three orders of magnitude smaller than the leading contributions ) . but",
    "this uncertainty due to the numerical accuracy will happen neither for s - wave pairing nor for smaller @xmath42 parameters , as one can see in table  1 .",

    "the typical band widths at the fermi surface are much more narrow than 0.1@xmath44 .",
    "the results of calculations for s - waves performed by previous authors @xcite were smooth in @xmath36 , and our results with two values of @xmath36 appear smooth with respect to a variation of the angular momentum .",

    "now , all energies are smaller , and the decrease of the condensation energy is about one and half order of magnitude while the change of the pairing amplitude @xmath35 is by a factor of 0.1 .",
    "the bcs behavior of the condensation energy is proportional to a square of the gap , @xmath55 .",
    "we find in our calculations that , the dependence of the condensation energy on the gap amplitude is a bit weaker than the bcs one . for the lower momentum channels a power of that dependence is smaller than for the higher angular momentum channels .",
    "this seem to be in contrast with measurements for ordinary , bcs like , superconductors which have a gap of the s - type . on the other hand ,",
    "measurements are not able to split the purely electronic and the phononic contributions , and we did not add phonons to our calculations .",
    "our result indicates that , we should not expect superconductivity at small @xmath42 .",
    "since all the energy components grow with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we can say that the maximally negative condensation energy would be for @xmath36=@xmath37 ( all states contribute to pairing ) and that there is no upper limit for @xmath35 .",
    "this is due to the fact that our condensation energy is proportional to @xmath56 with 1.5@xmath40@xmath57@xmath402 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 , which we set to 0.01@xmath53 , is much bigger than typical gaps .",
    "for instance for nb , we have s - wave pairing , @xmath42=0.87 , @xmath17=33.13  ev , while the experimental gap is 1.55  mev .",
    "we have chosen large delta , i.e. 0.01@xmath53@xmath50330  mev , for most of our calculations for the sake of accuracy , since the conclusions about the angular dependence of the condensation energy do not change with this parameter .    for lower density ,",
    "i.e. @xmath2=10 , we calculated again the condensation energy but for a new choice of the gap parameters : @xmath35=0.1@xmath41@xmath17 and @xmath36=0.5@xmath41@xmath58 , which are unrealistically high but the numerical accuracy is much better in this case .",
    "the result of above calculations is negative for superconductivity , which makes also a situation , that the phase transition occurs for a small gap , less probabilistic .",
    "if we wanted to include the electron - phonon or electron - paramagnon interaction , the expression for the total energy would be frequency independent because the frequency is integrated out in the scdft scheme ( see for instance ref .",
    "similar to the total energy , also the gap function would be static , as it is now .",
    "this is in contrast to the eliashberg formalism where inclusion of strong coupling changes the gap function to a dynamic parameter @xcite . as for the feedback effect of phonons or spin - fluctuations for the electronic energy and _ vice versa _ , this effect would exist if one solved the scdft equations in the bogoliubov - de gennes form ( for this formulation of scdft see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the way how we calculate the condensation energy in this work , the aforementioned feedback would not exist since all energy components contribute to the total energy independently through a single equation .",
    "this is another difference from the eliashberg scheme , where three coupled equations have to be solved for the self - energy @xmath59 , pairing - vertex @xmath60 and polarization @xmath61 @xcite .    summarizing results : the condensation energy is positive for all angular momentums , which indicates that we are unlikely to obtain superconductivity from the electronic correlations only .",
    "for the very dilute gas at @xmath42=10 , we obtained slightly negative values of the condensation energy when the gap is small .",
    "these results should be however viewed with care , because all the energy components are very small and at the limit of numerical accuracy for the multidimensional quadrature .",
    "we trust to three leading digits in tables  1 and 2 , while the condensation energy at @xmath42=10 is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the biggest contributions .",
    "also the random phase approximation @xcite for the correlation energy is exact only in the limit of high density,@xcite i.e. @xmath42@xmath401 .",
    "this treatment of the coulomb interaction might be insufficient for the density at @xmath42=10 .",
    "whether it is an appropriate approach it depends also on the angular momentum of the pairing potential and on the physical property one is interested @xcite .",
    "whether the superconductivity can exist without phonons or not is a very old problem . in 1965 ,",
    "kohn and luttinger @xcite suggested a mechanism of the cooper pair @xcite formation in the homogeneous gas due to friedel oscillations @xcite .",
    "these authors did not assume any particular form of the interaction , which could even be purely repulsive , since the attractive regions could form in real space because of a sharpness of the fermi surface in the reciprocal space .",
    "it has been discussed that , for the pairing potential at higher angular momentum , the superconducting state was more favorable than for s - waves .",
    "the above conclusions were based on the mathematical analysis of irreducible vertexes with the particle - particle interaction up to the second order ( see fig .  [ feynman ] ) . the criterion used for the superconductivity was the occurrence of a pole at t@xmath4 in the scattering amplitude for pairs of quasi - particles of equal and opposite momenta and in the total energy corresponding to two particles on the fermi surface .",
    "superconductivity obtained due to the plasmon exchange alone seemed to be overestimated .",
    "several papers solving the eliashberg equations with the rpa model for the coulomb interaction predicted superconductivity for s - wave pairing at quite high densities . within the weak coupling limit of the electron - phonon interaction",
    "the eliashberg equations could be considered as * k*-dependent only due to the kmk approximation @xcite . in the limit of strong coupling to phonons ,",
    "the * k*- and @xmath62-dependent equations have to be solved .",
    "while first approximation led to superconductivity @xcite at the density lower than @xmath2=6 , solving the strong coupling regime equations yields a change in a sign of the coulomb parameter @xcite ( @xmath5@xmath400 ) at the density @xmath2@xmath502.5 .",
    "the total energy diagrams included in both approaches are shown in fig .",
    "[ feynman ] .",
    "the common assumption in the aforementioned two approaches is that the polarization function , which enters the rpa screened interaction contains only normal green s function loops , neglecting the anomalous ones which are also included in our scheme .",
    "in addition , the normal green s function used by sham and co - workers was obtained self - consistently in contrast to all the other papers discussed here .",
    "the correctness of such an approach was discussed by several authors @xcite also by occasion of the gw approximation @xcite . the criterion for superconductivity used by takada",
    "@xcite was a nonzero critical temperature .",
    "sham and co - workers@xcite considered the electron gas to be superconducting when the coulomb pseudo - potential @xmath5 was positive .",
    "a number of papers that included vertex corrections on different level approximations predicted decreased temperatures of phase transition .",
    "grabowski and sham @xcite studied the @xmath62-dependent only eliashberg equations with vertex corrections up to the second order . within that simplified model ,",
    "the signum of @xmath5 changed at @xmath2=7 .",
    "more extensive study of vertex corrections were done within the kmk , * k*-dependent scheme extended to the strongly correlated systems by takada @xcite , who included more than 50 diagrams systematically using the effective - potential expansion . as a conclusion of that work the phase transition occurred at @xmath2@xmath633.9 ,",
    "the maximum of the critical temperature was obtained at @xmath2=7.2 , and @xmath64 decreased for lower densities .",
    "bche and rietschel @xcite added the vertex corrections , within the phenomenological model by kukkonen and overhauser ( ko ) @xcite , to the earlier work by rietschel and sham @xcite , and did not obtain superconductivity up to @xmath2=5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 for gas in the range of 1@xmath1@xmath2@xmath15 was positive and varied between 0.05 and 0.1 .",
    "then , takada @xcite performed * k*- and @xmath62-dependent calculations with the local - field correction of the ko model and showed a significant effect of corrections beyond rpa around @xmath2=5 .",
    "another observation made in his work was that , although the compressibility @xmath65 and the spin susceptibility @xmath66 were strongly dependent on the vertex corrections , @xmath6 of gas at the density @xmath2@xmath6320 was similar to the temperature obtained from rpa . for @xmath2@xmath6340",
    "the critical temperature has been approximated by @xmath64@xmath670.04@xmath41e@xmath68 .",
    "all the aforementioned papers on the superconducting homogeneous gas , within rpa and beyond , dealt with the pairing potential of the s - type .",
    "the s- , p- and d - type pairing potentials examined in ref .",
    "@xcite led to the conclusion that the vertex corrections to s - waves are much more important than to the higher momentum channels .    in this work",
    ", we calculated the condensation energy at zero temperature , instead of solving the gap equation for finite temperatures .",
    "this way we are not able to determine the critical temperature for the densities at which we find superconductivity . on the other hand , negative values of the condensation energy are very small , of order @xmath501.5@xmath4110@xmath51 mev , at the densities @xmath2@xmath6910 for f - waves and the higher-@xmath0 channels . for d - waves ,",
    "the condensation energy is positive but very small .",
    "we concluded that this effect might be due to an accuracy of the multidimensional numerical quadrature of objects with many singularities . on this point",
    "we want to comment that most of standard quantum chemistry programs which calculate two - electron integrals do not accede an accuracy higher than 6 important digits .",
    "our task is even more difficult because in addition to calculating the @xmath70- and @xmath71-momentum vectors , we have to perform the quadrature over the bosonic matsubara frequency , and singularities in the superconducting state have much more complicated shape @xcite than those of the two - electron integrals calculated for the normal state .",
    "the positive aspect of the method employed here is the absence of any approximation except rpa .",
    "the dft is exact for the ground state studied here .",
    "we do not make any assumption about phononic interactions , which we neglect .",
    "but if we wanted to include the electron - phonon interactions , then the way of treating the weak and the strong coupling would be the same @xcite .",
    "we do not drop either the momentum dependence or the frequency dependence of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the vertex corrections , especially important for the moderate densities for the properties like the critical temperature @xcite , are not taken into account in this work",
    ". however , we believe that the inclusion of vertex corrections would not change the conclusions , because for f - waves the strength of the coulomb attraction is not as much overestimated by the polaron exchange as for s - waves @xcite .    another interesting question would be whether it is possible that at some densities s - waves are favorable for the superconducting state and at other densities the higher-@xmath0 pairing would lead to lower energy .",
    "such s - wave to p - wave transition has been reported by takada @xcite at @xmath42=4.7 while for higher densities the energy of p - waves was lower .",
    "kchenhoff and wlfle @xcite , by solving two coupled bethe - salpeter equations for the two - particle vertex functions in the particle - hole channels , found the p - wave superconductivity for 10@xmath40@xmath2@xmath4035 and the s - wave superconductivity for @xmath2@xmath6335 . from our results , which are monotonic with the angular momentum number , such @xmath0-wave to @xmath72-wave transition seems not to be the case   ( since @xmath73=0 ) . ] .",
    "we assumed singlet pairing .",
    "thus , only the even numbers @xmath0 ( like s - waves , d - waves etc . )",
    "are relevant , and it would be incorrect from the symmetry point of view to compare the total energy of s - waves with the total energy of p - waves .",
    "on the other hand , if there is not much energy gain by the cooper pair formation then the spin pairing in the superconducting phase probably is the same as the magnetic phase of the normal state . within the qmc methods @xcite ,",
    "it has been widely examined theoretically that the ground state of the homogeneous electron gas is paramagnetic for high and intermediate densities , and the transition to the ferromagnetic phase occurs at about @xmath42@xmath325 .",
    "there is an experimental evidence @xcite for the ferromagnetic phase in ca@xmath74la@xmath75b@xmath76 at the density @xmath42=28 a.u . , where the saturation moment of 0.07  @xmath77 per electron resists below the temperature 600  k , which is of the order of the fermi temperature of the electron gas .",
    "however , for this experiment the iron substrate was chosen .",
    "another experimental group @xcite could not find any evidence for the intrinsic ferromagnetism in any of a@xmath74la@xmath75b@xmath76 ( a = ca , sr ) samples .",
    "as for the novel superconducting materials with triplet pairing , they can not be described within a model based on the local spin density approximation , where the parametrization on a homogeneous gas results works well . in order to describe those superconductors , like sr@xmath78ruo@xmath79 or ( tmtsf)@xmath78x , it has been shown by shimahara in ref .",
    "@xcite that , one should add strong short range correlations to weaken the coulomb interaction and then the electron - phonon mechanism could cause pairing .",
    "moreover a model assumed in our work is 3d , while sr@xmath78ruo@xmath79 should be described in 2d and ( tmtsf)@xmath78x in 1d .",
    "there is also a question about an effect of the fluctuations which could mediate the pairing interaction ( for such a model see the work of abanov and chubukov in ref .",
    "such calculations for the condensation energy in strongly correlated systems , where both effects of the electron - phonon and the electron - paramagnon interactions are taken into account , have been performed by haslinger and chubukov in ref .",
    "@xcite . the essential difference between those calculations and ours ,",
    "if we included phonons and paramagnons , would be in the frequency dependence of the gap function , which in our case is static due to different formulation of the problem from the very begin . for the inclusion of the dynamical effect to the gap",
    ", one needs to go beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "in fact , such formulation exists within the multicomponent dft scheme proposed by kreibich and gross @xcite , and developed by van leeuwen @xcite .    in conclusion : we have calculated the condensation energy of the homogeneous electron gas at zero temperature within the density functional theory for superconductors .",
    "the random phase approximation was assumed for the coulomb interaction and no phononic contributions have been added .",
    "we did not consider pairing mechanism mediated by fluctuations . within this approach",
    ", there is no superconductivity for any momentum of the pairing potential for the densities up to @xmath2@xmath39 .",
    "we found very weak superconductivity for f - waves and higher-@xmath0 pairing at @xmath2=10 , but this effect is so small that could be due to the neglecting of the vertex correction , or due to the accuracy of the numerical quadrature .",
