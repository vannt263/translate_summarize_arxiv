    "the design of josephson junction circuits in an appropriate electromagnetic environment@xcite is currently of great interest in the context of superconducting qubits@xcite .",
    "such qubits are _ tunable artificial atoms_. in analogy , one can envision long , periodic arrays@xcite of josephson junctions , which are engineered metamaterials , or _ fully designable and tunable artificial crystals_. in this context , we study the physics of regular , one - dimensional josephson junction arrays ( 1d - jjas ) with nontrivial unit cells , beyond a single junction or superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) .",
    "regular jjas have gained renewed interest : 1d - jjas have been the subject of study for the development of the 10 volt josephson voltage standard @xcite , and were more recently investigated for a current standard  @xcite , the transfer of quantum information  @xcite , and the readout and amplification of qubit signals  @xcite at the quantum noise level  @xcite .",
    "2d - jjas have long been of interest in the context of quantum phase transitions@xcite , and were recently investigated as negative permeability metamaterials@xcite .",
    "here we focus on the exploration of dispersion relations and band gaps , well known from condensed matter and crystal physics .",
    "very recently , crystal physics with 1d - jjas was studied in the regime where the josephson junctions are treated as charge qubits@xcite .",
    "we consider the opposite limit of junctions in the phase regime , where junctions have a comparatively large area and therefore the advantage that they can be fabricated with a low relative spread of parameters .",
    "furthermore , we suggest two designs for which the band gap can be tuned by only one common applied magnetic field , which simplifies possible experiments .",
    "junctions in the phase regime are approximately described by their linear behavior if the current flowing in the junctions is much less than the critical current .",
    "the array can then be regarded as a complex transmission line with a non - trivial , gapped dispersion relation .",
    "a resonator made with such a transmission line could find use in circuit cavity qed@xcite for read - out of qubit signals .",
    "nonlinear corrections to the model presented here can be used to realize parametric amplification  @xcite and quantum noise squeezing  @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the linear regime , and focus on the possibilities of more complex unit cells and the parameter regimes achievable in realistic experiments .",
    "we begin our studies with a unit cell consisting of two junctions ( or squids ) with different parameters , as shown in fig .",

    "2 , i.e. , a frequency region in which no propagating modes appear and the real part of the impedance vanishes .",
    "this gap appears at frequencies of the order of the plasma frequencies of the individual junctions .",
    "we investigate the parameter dependence of the gap and possibilities to lower it to the experimentally accessible frequency region , appropriate for qubit design .",
    "then we discuss the connection between the real part of the impedance and the density of states for arbitrary unit cells in the linear regime , and present a more general treatment which no longer requires the unit cells to be identical .",
    "we use this general approach to show that the gap persists in the presence of a small parameter spread ( @xmath1 standard deviation ) , and present simulations for a transmission experiment with realistic boundary conditions .",
    "a model of 1d - jjas in the linear regime is shown in fig .  1a , where each unit cell consists of a josephson junction ( with josephson energy @xmath2 and capacitance @xmath3 ) , and a capacitance to ground @xmath4 .",
    "in the linear phase regime , one can introduce the plasma frequency @xmath5 , with linear josephson inductance @xmath6 and superconducting flux quantum @xmath7 . here ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath3 describe an intersite inductive and capacitive interaction , respectively , where we defined a site as the island between two junctions .",
    "the capacitance @xmath4 describes an onsite coulomb interaction between cooper pairs .",
    "we consider situations were resistive terms can be neglected .",
    "also note that in the limit @xmath9 the model reduces to the discrete , lumped element model of a transmission line for transverse electromagnetic waves .",
    "we start our studies with the generalization that the array consists of a lattice of unit cells each consisting of a basis of two josephson junctions , for which we introduce an additional index @xmath10 or @xmath11 to the parameters above , see fig .",
    "let us first discuss a special case included in the generalized model : if we choose @xmath12 and regard @xmath13 as a geometric inductance instead of a josephson inductance , we recover a model containing one junction and an additional inductance in series .",
    "this model was studied earlier , where the inductance @xmath14 was included in order to model the electromagnetic inductance of the jja transmission line@xcite .",
    "this inductance led to a gap in the real part of the impedance , taken between input port and ground@xcite , which corresponds to a gap in the dispersion relation as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "however , for typical parameters the gap appeared at approximately @xmath15-@xmath16 hz . while the lower frequency could , in principle , be reduced by lowering the plasma frequency of the junction , the upper frequency extended beyond the range of validity of the simple josephson junction model used . with the two - junction model presented here ,",
    "however , the upper band edge can be reduced in frequency by orders of magnitude .",

    "the length of a unit cell is called @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the wave number of a traveling wave solution .",

    "we shall now motivate the presence of this gap and then analyze its parameter dependence .",
    "first take an array with periodic boundary conditions and simple unit cells as in fig .  1a , where each unit cell has only one degree of freedom due to loop constraints .",
    "linearization of the equations of motion , in small value of phase difference across each junction , approximates the system as coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "a traveling wave ansatz yields a single branch in the dispersion relation .",
    "this branch will have an upper cutoff frequency due to the discreteness of the model but no second branch and no gap . if we now consider new unit cells consisting of two original cells , each of the new cells has two independent degrees of freedoms .",
    "this results in a representation of the dispersion relation where the original branch is mirrored at half the brillouin zone , and thus appears as two branches as shown in fig",
    ".  3a . here",
    ", we used the length @xmath19 for the new unit cell .",
    "if an asymmetry of parameters is introduced within each unit cell , a splitting in the dispersion relation occurs as shown in fig .",
    "a geometric inductance @xmath23 introduces a much stronger asymmetry , which explains the wide gap and experimentally inaccessibly high frequency of the upper band edge ( which tends to infinity for @xmath24 ) in the model of ref .  .",
    "with the two - junction model , we have a wide range of accessible parameters so that we can engineer the band gap in an appropriate frequency range .",

    "the gap vanishes , @xmath49 , if both @xmath50 and @xmath51 kinks in the plot appear at the points , where either @xmath46 or @xmath47 change sign . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : extrema ] ) this corresponds to switching the position of the minima of @xmath52 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which can be shown to be realized by a flat ( constant in @xmath20 ) upper branch @xmath52 at these points .",
    "tunable inductances as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionlowenergy ] can be achieved by replacing one or both junctions in each unit cell by a squid , which consists of two parallel junctions with josephson energy @xmath55 , and which is pierced by a magnetic field @xmath56 .",
    "the josephson energy , which is inversely proportional to the josephson inductance , can then be controlled as @xmath57 . here , @xmath58 is the effective area of the squid with respect to the @xmath56-field .",
    "a design with one junction and one squid per unit cell has the advantage that one of the two inductances can be tuned continuously without changing the other inductance .",
    "a design with two squids per unit cell has different advantages .",
    "clearly , one can then tune both josephson energies .",
    "if one chooses different areas @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the two squids , a change in magnetic field @xmath61 leaves the josephson energy of the first squid invariant , while it changes that of the second squid . in this sense , one can tune both josephson energies independently with only one common magnetic field .",
    "thus , this design is preferable in experiments which test many combinations of inductances @xmath62 , while the aforementioned design is better if one needs a continuous change of one inductance , which might become important for applications .",
    "here , we will clarify why the real part of the impedance and the dispersion relation are connected as presented in fig .  2 , and",
    "show that this connection is of more general nature . at the same time",
    ", we will provide formulas which can also be used in the case of more general types of unit cells ( e.g. with three or more different josephson junctions or squids ) and for the investigation of parameter spreads .",

    "further , @xmath69 is the capacitance matrix and @xmath70 is the inverse inductance matrix , which can contain both the kinetic inductance due to josephson junctions and the geometric inductance .",
    "this is a problem of coupled harmonic oscillators , which can be diagonalized by the transformation @xmath71 .",
    "here we took into account that the matrices @xmath72 and @xmath73 can always be chosen symmetric , and defined @xmath74 as the matrix which has columns consisting of the normalized , real eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath75 .",
    "the transformed lagrangian is given as @xmath76 $ ] , where we introduced the eigenvalues @xmath77 of @xmath78 .",
    "these frequencies @xmath79 resemble the dispersion relation for a regular array , and can still be calculated in the presence of imperfections as shown in section iv .",
    "the equations of motion in this eigenbasis are decoupled and given as @xmath80 .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to the transformed lagrangian is given as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the conjugate variable to @xmath83 .",
    "for later convenience , this hamiltonian can be rewritten in the standard form @xmath84 when creation and annihilation operators are defined by the equations @xmath85    now we proceed to consider the connection between the real part of the impedance , the density of states and the dispersion relation . for the frequency range",
    "at which the dispersion relation shows a gap , there are no undamped , propagating modes and hence no transmission ( in the limit of an infinite array ) .",
    "then signals applied to the edge of the array having a frequency within this gap will be reflected back , and the impedance becomes purely imaginary .",
    "in general , the real part of the impedance can be expressed via the fluctuation dissipation theorem@xcite as @xmath86 here , the spectral density is given as @xmath87 , where the voltage operator is given in the heisenberg representation , @xmath88 , and we assume a boltzmann distribution for the averaging , @xmath89 with @xmath90 . evaluating the trace in the energy eigenbasis @xmath91 yields @xmath92    in the case of a hamiltonian consisting of @xmath64 decoupled harmonic oscillators discussed above , the states @xmath93 and @xmath94 are product states , and the energies @xmath95 and @xmath96 depend on the occupation numbers of these states .",
    "for example , the energy of the state @xmath97 is @xmath98 we shall assume sufficient spread of capacitances and inductances in an experiment , such that we do not have to consider degeneracies of the energies @xmath99 . if we further consider for the operator of voltage in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sv ] ) the voltage at one site , @xmath100 , we can rewrite the voltage operator as @xmath101 , with coefficients @xmath102 .",
    "it is then straight forward to calculate the matrix elements @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sv ] ) to get @xmath104 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : rezorig ] ) , the real part of the impedance is given as @xmath105 the delta - function on the right side of the equation picks out only terms in the sum over @xmath0 for which @xmath106 .",
    "the real part of the impedance is thus given as the number of states per frequency interval [ in the continuum limit @xmath107 , multiplied by a weight factor @xmath108 which depends on the distribution of capacitances and inductances in the circuit .",
    "the two branches in the dispersion relation and the associated gap in frequency , where no propagating modes exist in the jja transmission line , could be a useful property for the design of quantum circuits in the microwave region .",
    "the essential ingredient for realizing this gap is an inequality of the parameters for each of two junctions in the basis of the periodic structure , such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : nogap ] ) is _ not _ fulfilled . here",
    "we examine realistic designs , subject to the constraints of fabrication , which can achieve this asymmetry .",
    "the designs naturally fall into two different parameter regimes depending on the transmission line geometry used , coplanar or stripline .",
    "when the jja is made in a coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) geometry , where the ground plane is on the sides of the jja , the parameter regime @xmath109 is easily realized . in this regime ,",
    "the gap is vanishing or small when the plasma frequencies of the two junctions are the same , and one should thus aim for parameters @xmath110 in order to observe the gap .",
    "when fabricating jjas , typically all junctions are made in the same process step , resulting in a tunnel barrier which is nearly uniform across the entire chip or wafer . in this case",
    ", the josephson capacitance @xmath3 and inductance @xmath111 will be proportional and inversely proportional to the junction area , respectively , and the plasma frequency @xmath112 will therefore be independent of the junction area .",
    "thus , simply changing the junction area in the fabrication process will not achieve the desired goal .",
    "subject to the constraint of uniform tunnel barriers , there are two ways to bring down the plasma frequency .",
    "the first method is to increase @xmath113 of one of the junctions by forming a squid loop of this junction and applying an external magnetic flux .",
    "this method is attractive because changing the external flux corresponds to tuning the frequency range of the transmission gap .",
    "however , with this approach , dropping the plasma frequency also drops the critical current of the transmission line , and therefore non - linear corrections will become important at much lower power . the second possibility to drop",
    "the plasma frequency is to fabricate an on - chip capacitance in parallel with each junction .",
    "this method will not cause a degradation of critical current , however , it does require more layers of lithography than the simple single layer process used in the shadow deposition technique .",
    "fabrication with the nb trilayer technique however provides this parallel capacitance naturally@xcite .",
    "when designing an array in cpw geometry , one finds that the characteristic impedance of the array is not well matched to the termination impedance .",
    "when the array is terminated with a direct connection to an electrical lead , the termination of the array impedance at microwave frequencies will be approximately @xmath114 , set by the free space impedance @xmath115 @xmath116 .",
    "the transmission line impedance @xmath117 of the jja , which is the pure real impedance of an infinite array , is in the zero frequency limit given as @xmath118",
    ". it can be much larger than @xmath119 in the cpw geometry , where @xmath4 is relatively small , especially if @xmath8 is made large by suppressing the critical current .",
    "we desire that @xmath120k@xmath116 , in order to avoid quantum fluctuations of the phase which are not included in our model based on classical phase dynamics . when @xmath121 , one finds that large quantum fluctuations of the phase result in a coulomb blockade , and our assumption of classical phase dynamics has completely broken down@xcite .",
    "an alternative route to circuit design is based on the stripline geometry , where the array is fabricated on top of a ground plane with a thin , insulating ( non - tunneling ) barrier separating the array islands from the ground plane . for the stripline geometry ,",
    "one easily realizes the regime @xmath122 . in this regime , it is not necessary to have different plasma frequencies of the two junctions , and we find that a considerable gap in transmission also occurs if @xmath123 . in this case",
    "the gap appears well below the plasma frequency .",
    "the condition of unequal capacitances to ground is easily realized in the stripline geometry , where the arrays are made as planar circuits , with overlapping films forming the tunnel barriers .",
    "we have formulated a design for a jja on an heavily oxidized al ground plane , to be fabricated with the shadow evaporation technique . in our al tunnel junction fabrication",
    ", we find that it is possible to achieve plasma frequencies as low as @xmath124 ghz . a design with large area base electrodes ( 2.5 @xmath125 m x 20 @xmath125 m ) and long , narrow dolan bridges",
    "( 0.1 @xmath125 m x 2.5 @xmath125 m ) with small overlap ( 0.1 @xmath125 m ) after shadow evaporation can achieve the following parameters : @xmath126  pf , @xmath127  ff , @xmath128 pf , @xmath129 ff , with the array critical current being dominated by the smaller junction 2 , @xmath130 na .",
    "for this design , we find that the lower gap edge comes down in frequency to @xmath131 ghz , in a frequency range accessible to present day qubit designs or broad band transmission measurements . for this design , the transmission line impedance of the array is @xmath132 , which is well matched to the impedance of the input and output ports of an array with high frequency leads connected at each end .",
    "such a design , with a rather low critical current and therefore strongly nonlinear inductance , is ideal for the distributed parametric amplifier@xcite . in the low power regime , where linear behavior is expected",
    ", we find that such an array makes a good superconducting low pass filter , with a very sharp drop in transmission at 8.5 ghz in a design with only 20 unit cells in series .",
    "so far , we assumed that junctions can be fabricated identically if desired .",
    "however , in reality , there will be a spread of junction parameters in the fabrication .",
    "we expect that the gap in the spectrum , impedance , and transmission will persist provided that the disorder is weak enough and/or the array is short enough that localization effects can be ignored .",
    "we investigated this further as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : combined ] ( obtained by classical circuit theory ) , where we simulated a random spread of josephson inductances with normal distribution and standard deviation @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : combined]b , d , f .",

    "furthermore , accurate boundary conditions on a finite length array become important for a real experiment . in fig .",
    "[ fig : combined]c , d we show the transmission for a finite array with boundary conditions defined by input and output leads with transmission line impedances @xmath137 .",
    "while this setup is not a cavity , it behaves like a resonator and supports standing waves because the input and output impedances @xmath138 are not matched to the array impedance @xmath139 .",
    "the standing waves can be seen by looking at the voltage at each site as in fig .",
    "[ fig : combined]e , f .",
    "note that because @xmath140 , the voltage antinode occurs in the middle of the array for the fundamental mode , opposite to standing waves in resonators formed by a large point - like impedance at each end of a transmission line , where @xmath141 .",
    "each standing wave condition is associated with a peak in the transmission as calculated in fig .",
    "6c , d for the case of no disorder , and 5% parameter spread , respectively . for frequencies inside the gap region ,",
    "the transmission drops drastically which can be understood by an exponential decay of voltage amplitude from the edge of the array .",
    "when disorder or parameter spread is introduced , an investigation of the eigenmodes shows localized states in the gap region , near the gap edge ( not shown ) .",
    "however , the broad gap in transmission remains essentially unaffected by a 5% spread in parameters .",
    "thus , the design of such a gap appears to be a robust and useful feature for quantum circuit engineering .",
    "we theoretically investigated regular josephson junction arrays with generalized unit cells , e.g. , unit cells consisting of two junctions with different parameters . in the linear approximation of the phase regime",
    ", we found a gap in the dispersion relation and in the real part of the impedance .",
    "this gap is not present in the linear regime of models with only one junction per unit cell , unless additional circuit elements in each unit cell are used .",
    "we derived the parameter dependence of the gap , and found that for a design with two different josephson junctions , the gap appears at frequencies of the same order of magnitude as the plasma frequencies of the two junctions .",
    "we suggested how to lower these frequencies in an experimental setup in order to shift the gap to an accessible frequency range . by replacing one of the two junctions per unit cell with a squid",
    ", the gap can be tuned in situ .",
    "furthermore , we derived the connection between the real part of the impedance , the density of states , and the dispersion relation for more general unit cells , and found expressions which can be used when the periodicity condition is lifted . using these expressions we showed that the gap persists upon a realistic parameter spread of the junctions .",
    "we also suggested a transmission experiment which we modeled with realistic boundary conditions .",
    "our results could on the one hand be used for comparatively simple demonstration of tunable artificial crystals with josephson junctions , which is interesting from the point of view of fundamental physics . on the other hand , such tunable artificial crystals , embedded in superconducting circuits ,",
    "could become important for new types of applications , for example , for specific types of frequency filters .",
    "one could also envision to protect qubits against decoherence with such jjas , by placing a cooper pair box qubit in the middle of an array .",
    "if the energy splitting of the qubit lies inside the region of the gap , where no traveling modes are available , we expect the relaxation of the qubit to be strongly suppressed .",
    "decoherence of a qubit is composed not only of the relaxation but also of the pure dephasing , where the latter time scale is typically the critical , shorter one .",
    "however , recent experiments reached extremely high decoherence times , which , at least for part of the frequency range , appeared to be limited by the relaxation@xcite . in this case ,",
    "suppression of the relaxation with a properly engineered gap would allow refined studies on remaining sources of decoherence .",
    "the model we presented in this paper is a linear analysis of the jja transmission line .",
    "the interesting effects we describe arise due to the plasma resonance of the josephson junctions when they are arranged in a discrete periodic structure .",
    "many analogies exist between the microwave phenomena presented here , and the emerging field of `` plasmonics '' , as represented by optical plasma resonances in metallic and semiconducting nanostrucures@xcite .",
    "however , the linear approximation is valid only when the currents flowing in the junctions are much less than the critical current . when this condition is violated , nonlinear effects will appear , which can be very strong in comparison with dissipative effects in jjas .",
    "these nonlinear effects give rise to a host of interesting phenomena , such as parametric amplification@xcite . here",
    ", the ability to match the jja transmission line impedance for the case of the stripline geometry , with the electromagnetic transmission line impedance , leads to the possibility of a broad band parametric amplifier@xcite .",
    "another interesting nonlinear effect is the trapping or localization of energy in discrete breather modes@xcite , where a gap in the dispersion relation is used to prevent the radiation damping of josephson oscillations in a junction in the middle of the array@xcite .",
    "we hope that the analysis presented here will aid the development of future experiments in these directions .",
