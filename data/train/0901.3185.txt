    "the study of planetary nebulae ( pne ) has evolved enormously over the last half century , largely through the developing of new observational techniques .",
    "however , some fundamental subjects within the field have changed only slightly .",
    "outstanding among these latter subjects are distances and the three dimensional ( 3-d ) structure of individual pne .",
    "unfortunately , only a few pne are close enough for accurate determination of trigonometric parallaxes @xcite and the determination of a 3-d model from high velocity slit spectroscopy has largely been limited to a narrow range of relatively high surface brightness but well resolved pne , c.f .",
    "sabbadin et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) and references within . in the case of the closest classical pn ( ngc 7293 , the helix nebula )",
    "there is an accurate trigonometric distance and in a series of papers utilizing imaging and spectroscopy a quadrapolar model was derived @xcite .",
    "another classical nebula , ngc 6720 , the ring nebula , was the subject of 3-d modeling @xcite through extensive spectroscopic mapping , but in this case the trigonometric parallax distance of 700@xmath0 pc @xcite is quite uncertain , as are some properties of the central star .",
    "fortunately , if a good kinematic 3-d model of a pn is available , measurements of tangential motions can be used to determine distances .",
    "this has been done for a large number of pne @xcite using vla observations of the radio continuum with spatial resolutions of about 1 , but the necessary supporting kinematic models are usually not available and a defacto spherical model was assumed in deriving most of the distances .",
    "there is also the uncertainty resulting from the radio continuum observations sampling a different portion of the nebula than that studied in the optical emission lines that were used for deriving expansion velocities and the problems associated with the fact that radial velocities measure bulk motion of the gas whereas apparent expansion also includes the effect of the changing position of the ionization front .",
    "odell et al . ( 2007b ) determined the 3-d structure of ngc 6720 from optical line spectroscopy within the assumption of homologous ( resembling ballistic ) expansion , a general characteristic of classical pne known for more than half a century @xcite even though such a general expansion characteristic is difficult to theoretically understand @xcite .",
    "a recent study @xcite demonstrates the errors that can arise from an incorrect assumption of homologous expansion , but unfortunately the probable errors in our current study do not allow questioning that assumption in any detail . in the odell et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) study it was determined that the nebula was a triaxial ellipsoid seen nearly pole - on , with most of the mass confined to an elliptical ring lying almost in the plane of the sky .",
    "the basic correctness of the model was confirmed from application of a very different method of 3-d modeling in a study by steffen et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) , which also added modeling of the outer halos of the ring nebula . however , the conclusions drawn from the radial velocity study were not as secure as one would hope because radial velocities of a pole - on ellipsoid with most of the material nearly in the plane of the sky are not sensitive ways of mapping where the material is located and of the material s spatial velocity .",
    "this is the underlying reason for formulating an observing program that will add information about the tangential velocities .    in this article",
    "we report on a study of the ring nebula that employed imaging observations of an order of magnitude higher spatial resolution than the vla studies of other pne , but comparable or longer time baselines .",
    "moreover , we utilized the same optical lines for both spectroscopy and imaging .",
    "the imaging observations and their analysis are described in   2.1 and   3 .",
    "new spectrophotometric observations are described in   2.2 and their use for determining corrections to the apparent tangential expansion velocities is described in ",
    "4 . these combined data , together with the results of our earlier spectroscopic study @xcite , are the basis of the discussion presented in ",
    "we obtained new hubble space telescope ( hst ) wfpc2 images as parts of programs go 11231 and go 11232 .",
    "the go 11231 observations were in the f469n ( he  ii ) , f547 m ( continuum ) , and f673n ( [ s  ii ] ) filters and executed on 2008 april 23 .",
    "triple exposures of 60 , 200 , and 260 seconds respectively were combined to provide high signal to noise ratio images free from cosmic ray events .",
    "the go 11232 observations were made in the f658n ( [ n  ii ] ) and f502n ( [ o  iii ] ) filters on 2008 may 6 . again",
    "triple exposures of 260 seconds were made in each filter and similarly combined using iraf tasks .",
    "identical pointing was employed with the central star of the nebula centered in ccd3 of the wfpc2 , duplicating as close as possible the conditions of earlier observations in f502n and f658n in program go 7632 , except that the current two - gyro pointing restrictions of the hst caused us to adopt a nearly reciprocal position angle ( p.a . ) of 213.2 , while the go 7632 observations were made with p.a.=33.8 .",
    "the interval between the go 7632 and go 11232 observations in the f502n and f658n filters used for astrometry is 9.557 years .",
    "the go 11232 images were aligned with the geomap and geotran iraf tasks using four stars , including the central star .",
    "the alignment of the central star was corrected with the imshift task to an accuracy of better than 0.02 , leaving the possibility of a poorer alignment accuracy in rotation for objects further out in the nebula , but eliminating any effects of the other field stars not moving in the same manner as the central star .",
    "the ring nebula has been the target of many spectroscopic programs at various spectral resolutions , the latest and most comprehensive high resolution study being that of odell et  al .",
    "( 2007b ) , while recent moderate resolution studies are those of guerrero , et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , garnett &  dinerstein ( 2001 ) , and liu et  al ( 2004 ) .",
    "moderate resolution spectroscopy offers the opportunity to measure the most useful diagnostic emission lines , but previous studies have not combined study of the critical position angles ( the major axis points towards p.a.=60  and the minor axis points towards p.a.=150 ) and full wavelength coverage .",
    "we have closed this information - gap by making new observations with the boller and chivens spectrograph mounted on the 2.12 m telescope at the san pedro martir observatory .",
    "it was expected that these observations would also provide ground based telescope reference data for calibrating the f469n and f673n filters of the hst s wfpc2 , which meant that we used an unusually wide slit ( in order to diminish the effects of comparing high and low spatial resolution data ) .",
    "we employed a 300 @xmath1 m wide entrance slit ( 3.93 ) .",
    "the scale of the site ccd was 1.05  pixel along the slit and 3.05  / pixel along the dispersion direction .",
    "the full width at half maximum signal ( fwhm ) for the final combined spectra along the direction of the dispersion was 9.4  .",
    "observations were made at p.a.=150  on the night of 2008 july 25 and at p.a.=60  on the night of 2008 july 26 under photometric conditions .",
    "the flux standard bd+25  3941 in the iraf database was used for both nights .",
    "various exposure times were used in order to avoid the problems of the bright lines saturating on the longer exposures . for p.a.=150",
    "we obtained seven exposures of 180 seconds , five of 600 seconds , and four of 1200 seconds for a total exposure time of 9060 seconds .",
    "for p.a.=60  we obtained three exposures of 180 seconds , three of 600 seconds and two of 1200 seconds for a total exposure time of 4740 seconds .",
    "the seeing fwhm was about 2.3  on both nights .",
    "twilight sky exposures were made on the evening of the p.a.=150  observations and were used for characterizing the small flat field corrections .",
    "the data were reduced using iraf tasks , which included flat field correction , distortion correction , wavelength calibration , and rendering into cgs system surface brightness units ( ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 steradian@xmath2 ) .",
    "the spectra were combined to form a single spectrum for each position angle , with only the shorter exposure time observations used for the brightest emission lines .",
    "digital versions of these spectra are available in the electronic form of this paper .",

    "the regions beyond the bright ring were used to determine how much should be subtracted from the ring spectra .",
    "a final pair of background subtracted spectra of 107 pixels length centered on the bright ring was created .",
    "both of these spectra were sampled in four regions called top ( 25 pixels ) , bottom ( bot , 25 pixels ) , and middle ( mid , 13 pixels ) with the results presented in table 1 .",
    "an illustration of the quality of the spectra is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the range of pixels measured from the central star , with positive numbers away from the direction of the p.a . , are given in table 2 .",

    "the sample region spectra were measured with iraf task `` splot '' , with deconvolution of line blends where necessary .",
    "not all features were measured , in particular those blended lines that would not be useful in a quantitative analysis .",
    "the interstellar extinction correction was determined from the f(h@xmath7)/f(h@xmath6 ) and f(h@xmath4)/f(h@xmath6 ) ratios using the general extinction curve presented in osterbrock &  ferland ( 2006 ) and their theoretical line ratios of 2.87 and 0.256 respectively .",
    "the weighted average extinction was c@xmath8=0.13@xmath90.04 ( in close agreement with the value of 0.14 derived by guerrero , et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) but about half that of barker ( 1987 ) ) and the same extinction correction was applied to each sample .",
    "the extinction curve utilized and the results of this analysis of the samples are presented in table 1 .",
    "we also derived c@xmath8 pixel by pixel along both slits .",
    "this indicated that there is a sharp rise just outside of the peak in h@xmath6 brightness in the directions p.a.=150 , 240 , and 330 , but not towards 60 .",
    "these rises are like those shown in garnett &  dinerstein ( 2001 ) towards p.a.=271 , although they questioned the reality of the rise because it might be due to misalignment of their spectra , which is not an issue with our observations .",
    "since the peaks in brightness occur just inside the projection of the ionization front and the front is curved , the rise in extinction just outside the peaks is probably due to dust in dense neutral gas projected onto ionized material inside the ionization front .",
    "our spectra are comparable in resolution to the 7   resolution spectra of guerrero , et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) at similar p.a .",
    "values and with a slit width of 1.2 , however , their exposure time along the major axis was 1800 sec ( ours was 4740 sec ) and the sum of the exposure times of their spectra nearly along the minor axis was 4500 sec ( ours was 9060 sec ) , although it should be noted that they covered a wider wavelength range ( 3727   through 7330  ) .",
    "our resolution was poorer than the 2.1 - 2.3   reported by garnett &  dinerstein ( 2001 ) , who had a total exposure time of 3600 sec at p.a.=91  with a 2.5  wide slit , but covered a wider wavelength range than their 4150   through 5000   sample .",
    "the study of liu et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) was made with a p.a.=90  slit at a resolution of 1.5   in their blue samples and 3.5   in the red , both with a 1 \" slit and a maximum total exposure time in their reddest sample of 2560 sec .",
    "they reduced the long - slit spectrum to a single spectrum , which we show in   4.1 to blend regions of quite different conditions .",
    "their total wavelength coverage was 3600   through 8010  . because of the wider entrance slit and longer exposure times ,",
    "our data are of much higher spectrophotometric quality than these earlier studies , within the limitations of the spectral resolution .",
    "a measure of the large signal in this program is that the 4922   line of hei in the south east peak of the main ring gave an individual 1200 sec exposure signal of 850 counts in one pixel along the slit , even though this line is only about 1%  the flux of the h@xmath6 line and this observation represents only 13 %  of the entire signal for the 4922   line .",
    "since the central star has a surprisingly large spread in published v magnitude brightness ( 15.016.2 ) @xcite , we carefully measured this star on our spectra at 5550 (near the center of the v bandpass ) and determined that the correct value is v=15.65@xmath90.05 , in good agreement with the value of 15.75 determined by harris , et  al .",
    "the small difference in our new results and the value adopted in our earlier study of the nebula @xcite mean that the stellar properties adopted in that paper do not need to be changed .",
    "in an earlier study of the ring nebula @xcite pairs of hst wfpc2 images in the f658n filter were compared by magnifying the first epoch images until the difference of the first and second images was a minimum .",
    "the time interval between the images employed was 1.944 years and the magnification necessary was 1.0013@xmath90.0002 .",
    "this corresponds an annual expansion rate ( motion in mas yr@xmath2 divided by the distance @xmath10 from the central star in arcseconds ) of 0.7@xmath90.1 mas yr@xmath2/. however , a later paper @xcite argued that these results were possibly incorrect since the central intersection of the wfpc2 centered on the central star , which meant that the image of the nebula fell into four different ccd s and the known drift of the ccd s with respect to one another @xcite meant that an internally self consistent but flawed answer could be obtained .",
    "it is for this reason that we formulated the go 11232 observing program , where the images fell into a single ccd , whose results we present here .",
    "our new data were processed in two ways , first by magnification and comparison , as done before , and by measurement of individual features .",
    "our method of comparison was to magnify the first epoch images , align these with the second epoch image in the same filter , normalize them so that the total signal was the same , then take their ratio .",
    "we noted that the ratio images began as being highly structured , indicating a mismatch , then became nearly grey in a small scaling range , then again became structured at larger scaling factors .",
    "samples of the ratio images used in the analysis are shown in figure  2 .",
    "this rather qualitative method gave a best scaling factor of 1.0016@xmath90.0005 for the f658n images and 1.0019@xmath90.001 for the f502n images , yielding annual expansion rates over the 9.557 year interval of 0.17@xmath90.05 mas yr@xmath2/  and 0.20@xmath90.05 mas yr@xmath2/  respectively , a weighted average ( f502n being given one half weight because of less structure in that filter ) of 0.18@xmath90.05 mas yr@xmath2/ , only a fraction of the annual expansion rates previously derived from segmented images and arguing that those rates are in error because of the use of images divided onto four ccd s .",
    "the probable errors of our present study are very qualitative as they depend strictly on judgement about when the fit is best .",
    "non - homologous expansion would have manifested itself by different parts of the ratio image becoming featureless at different scale factors .",
    "qualitatively , this did not seem to be the case except in the bright northern quadrant , where some non - homogeneity could be seen in the inner and outer parts of the brightest section ( which was homologous ) .",

    "the relation of this result to the radial velocity expansion relation is determined by the distance to the nebula ( d ) .    by comparing the ratio of radial velocities with respect to the systemic velocity ( v@xmath17 ) at various angular distances from the central star , odell et al .",

    "one knows from the non - tilted form of the velocity ellipses of the high resolution spectra made nearly across the minor axis ( p.a.=160 ) that this axis lies in the plane of the sky , whereas those nearly along the major axis ( p.a.=70 ) are tilted with a difference of velocity of 6@xmath92 @xmath18 , with the east - northeast end approaching the observer . assuming that the full major axis is 67  and using the expansion rate of 0.23@xmath90.10 mas yr@xmath2/   means that the tangential velocity is 25.6 @xmath18 .",
    "the tangent of the tilt angle will be the ratio of the radial velocity difference ( 3 @xmath18 ) divided by the tangential velocity ( 25.6 @xmath18 ) .",

    "these are the polar regions of the nebula",
    ". the proper motions , on the other hand , will be more representative of the equatorial regions of the nebula , where the expansion direction is closest to the plane of the sky . in order to deal with this complication",
    ", it is necessary to adopt some model for the internal kinematics of the nebula . in this paper , we follow @xcite in assuming a `` hubble flow '' ( all gas velocities strictly radial and linearly proportional to distance from the central star ) , with a nebular radius along the polar axis of 1.5 times that along the major equatorial axis at @xmath22 .",
    "although this simple kinematic model seems to be broadly consistent with the observations , it is important to test it by searching for deviations from a pure hubble flow , as emphasized by steffen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the second complicating factor is that the proper motions measure a pattern speed , whereas the spectroscopy measures the physical speed of the gas .",
    "these are not necessarily the same thing , as elucidated in detail by mellema ( 2004 ) . in appendix",
    "a , we derive the correction factor , @xmath23 ( ratio of pattern speed to physical speed ) as a function of two parameters : @xmath24 , which is the degree of concentration of the ionized gas at its outer edge , and @xmath25 , which is the rate of change of the stellar ionizing luminosity divided by the nebular expansion rate : @xmath26",

    "this is larger , but within the uncertaintanties of the parallax determined value of 700@xmath0 pc @xcite . since both methods determine the distance from the reciprocal of the measured quantity , it is illuminating to compare the measured parallax 1.42@xmath90.55 mas with our predicted parallax 1.27@xmath90.73 mas .",
    "taking the average of these parallaxes ( 1.35@xmath90.6 ) , one determines a best recommended distance of 740@xmath30 pc .",
    "this is only a small change from the parallax determined distance used previously , but , it is determined from two independent methods and is the value to now be preferred .",
    "the origin of the knots in the ring , helix , and other nearby pne @xcite remains highly uncertain and an important diagnostic observation is whether the knots share the general expansion characteristics of the host pn or if they trail behind . in a study of the radial velocities of the similarly nearly pole - on pn ngc 7293 ( the helix nebula )",
    "@xcite argued that the knots were expanding , but at about one half the rate of expansion of the nebular material .",
    "this interpretation of the radial velocity data was disputed @xcite when the knot velocities were compared with several sources of nebular velocities , the conclusion being that the expansion rates of the knots and the nebula are indistinguishable .",

    "this means that either the knots in the ring nebula move in a very different way than those in the helix nebula or that the helix nebula results based on radial velocities @xcite are incorrect .",
    "the images of the ring nebula made in the h@xmath31  2.12@xmath1  line ( speck et  al .",

    "this agreement in radial velocity adds credence to the interpretation that the knots are moving at the same velocity as the nebular material .    on a small scale , many planetary nebulae show imhomogeneities in the form of dense molecular knots @xcite . in the case where the knot is well inside the global ionization front ,",
    "there is expected to be a locally divergent flow of ionized gas away from the head of the knot , e.g. , bertoldi &  mckee ( 1990 ) .",
    "this contradicts the assumption that all gas flows are radially away from the central star , so the above analysis can not be applied directly to this case .",

    "it is necessary that both the proper motion observations ( which measure @xmath36 ) and the spectroscopic observations ( which measure @xmath37 ) are detecting the knots , rather than the diffuse nebular emission .",

    "it is straightforward to show that the relative size of the second term is of order @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the recombination time .",
    "this ratio is rather small for typical nebular conditions , so we neglect the advective term in what follows , which is equivalent to assuming that the nebula passes through a sequence of static photoionization equilibrium states . with this approximation , we can take the time derivative of equation  ( [ eq : ionbalance ] ) , eliminating the density by use of equation  ( [ eq : mass ] ) , to obtain @xmath59 which yields the rate of change of ionized mass as @xmath60 on the other hand , we can also express the rate of change of ionized mass in terms of the relative velocity , @xmath61 , with which newly ionized gas leaves the ionization front : @xmath62 equations  ( [ eq : mdot ] ) and  ( [ eq : massflow ] ) can be combined to find the correction factor , @xmath63 , that relates the real and apparent expansion speeds : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the ratio of the rate of evolution of the ionizing luminosity to the rate of nebular expansion .",

    "the overall timescale for this sequence is set primarily by the core mass at the end of the agb phase ( higher mass cores tend to evolve more rapidly ) , but with a secondary dependence on the agb mass - loss history .",
    "the expansion timescale of the nebula generally increases monotonically with the nebular age , so that the three phases in the luminosity evolution ( rise , swift decline , slow decline ) produce three phases in the nebular evolution : ionization ( @xmath66 ) , recombination ( @xmath67 ) , re - ionization ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "these phases can be seen , for example , in the evolution of the mass of ionized gas in the models of natta &  hollenbach ( 1998 ) .",
    "the detailed evolution of the nebula can be rather intricate , even when only one - dimensional models are considered @xcite , especially during the high - luminosity phase when the fast stellar wind from the central star is expected to be dynamically important in the inner regions of the nebula .",
    "nonetheless , so long as the nebula is optically thick to ionizing radiation , the simple equation given above can be reliably applied in order to correct expansion parallaxes measured from the main nebula shell for cases where detailed tailored models , such as those given in schnberner et  al .",

    "note that the model given here does _ not _ apply to density - bounded nebulae , where the ionizing luminosity is high enough to ionize all the circumstellar material .",
    "the lack of an ionization front means that other features , such as shocks @xcite , must be used to determine expansion parallaxes in such cases .          if the ionizing luminosity , @xmath71 , is constant , then @xmath72 and we have @xmath73 . for a constant density nebula , @xmath74 and we obtain @xmath75 , which is the well - known result for the evolution of a classical strmgren sphere during the subsonic , d - type phase  the maximum ionized gas velocity is one half the expansion speed of the ionization front . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> we have combined recent hubble space telescope wfpc2 images in the [ o  iii ] 5007   and [ n  ii ] 6583   lines with similar images made 9.557 years earlier to determine the motion of the ring nebula within the plane of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> scaled ratio images argue for homologous expansion , that is , larger velocities scale with increasing distance from the central star . </S>",
    "<S> the rather noisy pattern of motion of individual features argues for the same conclusion and that the silhouetted knots move at the same rate as the surrounding gas . </S>",
    "<S> these tangential velocities are combined with information from a recent high resolution radial velocity study to determine a dynamic distance , which is in basic agreement with the distance determined from the parallax of the central star . </S>",
    "<S> we have also obtained very high signal to noise ratio moderate resolution spectra ( 9.4  ) along the major and minor axes of the nebula and from this determined the electron temperatures and density in the multiple ionization zones present . </S>",
    "<S> these results confirm the status of the ring nebula as one of the older planetary nebulae , with a central star transitioning to the white dwarf cooling curve .    </S>",
