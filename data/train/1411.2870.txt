    "half of the most massive ( @xmath17 ) galaxies at @xmath18 have evolved stellar populations and sfrs of only a few @xmath19 yr@xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , suggesting that they have undergone a rapid build - up of stellar mass followed by an effective phase of star formation ( sf ) quenching , probably via agn feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if significant dust is present in these galaxies , however , it would imply that the sfrs , inferred from the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) , are severely underestimated , and that their stellar populations are in fact not old but simply reddened by the dust .",
    "direct far - infrared ( fir ) measurements of the dust are therefore essential to unambiguously assess the level of obscured sf .",
    "a recent _ herschel _ stacking analysis by @xcite found that massive qgs at @xmath20 have ir luminosities comparable to local ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs , @xmath21 ) , inconsistent with the quiescence inferred from the uv continua ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as their low @xmath22 stacked flux densities @xcite .",
    "if qgs harbor significant dust - obscured sf , it would challenge the need for powerful quenching mechanisms .        here , we analyse a sample of @xmath014200 qgs with @xmath23 out to @xmath1 , selected over 1.48deg@xmath24 in the cosmos field .",
    "taking advantage of the available deep multi - wavelength data , we constrain their dust - obscured sfrs through stacking in _ spitzer _ multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) , _ herschel _ photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; @xcite ) and spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ; @xcite ) maps .",
    "these are compared with stacks in deep very large array ( vla ) radio maps .",
    "we infer extremely low levels of dust - obscured sf ( @xmath25\\,m_{\\odot}$]yr@xmath7 at @xmath26 $ ] ) , thus definitively confirming the quiescent nature of these galaxies .",
    "magnitudes are quoted in the ab system .",
    "we adopt a @xcite initial mass function , and @xmath27 = 70kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath28 = 0.3 and @xmath29 = 0.7 .",
    "we select galaxies brighter than @xmath30 from the ultravista survey @xcite that have @xmath31 and photometric redshifts @xmath32 .",
    "both @xmath13 and @xmath33 are from @xcite , derived from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits to broadband uv - to - irac photometry @xcite .",
    "a small number of agn , identified via their emission in x - rays @xcite , irac bands @xcite , or the radio @xcite , are removed to minimise the effects of erroneous sed fits and thus inaccurate @xmath33 and @xmath13 . including the agn in the analysis",
    "does not change the stacked flux densities ( within the uncertainties ) nor the conclusions of this letter .",
    "each galaxy is classified as a qg or a sfg based on its rest - frame nuv@xmath2r and r@xmath2j colors ( figure  [ fig : nuvrj ] ) .",
    "nuv@xmath2r is a measure of the amount of uv light from young stars ( i.e. , recent sf ) relative to the red optical light from evolved stellar populations , while r@xmath2j constrains the degree of dust attenuation in the red part of the spectrum .",
    "the qgs are divided into six bins of @xmath33 , each of which is split into four @xmath13-bins ( see table [ table : stack ] ) ; however , only @xmath13-bins which are @xmath34 mass - complete ( according to the limits presented in @xcite ) are included .    to weed out dusty galaxies erroneously classified as qgs , we cross - correlate our sample with the mips @xmath22 catalog of @xcite with a radius of @xmath35 . a redshift - dependent @xmath22 flux density ( @xmath36 )",
    "cut - off is then applied to remove qgs with dust - obscured sfrs @xmath37yr@xmath7 ( as inferred from their @xmath36  see section  [ sec : ms ] ) .",
    "the fraction ( @xmath38 ) of qgs with @xmath22-inferred sfrs @xmath37yr@xmath7 increases with redshift and peaks at 1319% for the most massive @xmath39 qgs ( see table [ table : detfrac ] ) .",
    "this suggests a higher fraction of misclassified qgs at @xmath39 , which is unsurprising given their faintness ( i @xmath40 ) .",
    "overall , however , the fractions are reassuringly small .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached from the fraction ( @xmath41 ) of _ herschel _ detected qgs ( @xmath42 ) , determined using the catalog of @xcite in which the @xmath22 sources are cross - identified to the _ herschel _ detections ( i.e. , s / n @xmath43 in at least two pacs or spire bands ) .",
    "this population of dusty galaxies having quiescent nuv@xmath2r and r@xmath2j colors could either be sfgs with strong attenuation , or galaxies containing evolved stellar populations and undergoing rejuvenation of sf @xcite .",
    "the robust _ herschel _ detections in the qg region tend to lie close to the qg / sfg classification boundary at least out to @xmath44 ( figure  [ fig : nuvrj ] ) , perhaps indicative of their post - starburst nature @xcite .",
    "for the stacking analysis ( section  [ sec : stacking ] ) we use the aforementioned mips @xmath22 imaging ( fwhm @xmath45 ) from @xcite , while the _ herschel _ pacs and spire maps are from the pacs evolutionary probe survey ( pep ; @xcite ) and the _ herschel _ multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( hermes ; @xcite ) , respectively .",

    "stacking we use the 1.4ghz vla - cosmos large survey @xcite , which reaches a root - mean - square noise ( rms ) of 15@xmath47jybeam@xmath7 at an angular resolution of @xmath50 ( fwhm ) .",
    "our _ herschel _ maps are characterised by a high level of source confusion which , if unaccounted for , will bias a stacked signal @xcite . here",
    ", we use a global deblending technique similar to that of @xcite but generalised to deblend multiple galaxy samples simultaneously , which in our case totaled 87 samples ( separated by their sfg / qg classifications , @xmath14- and @xmath13-bins , and sfr@xmath51 threshold ) .",
    "source confusion is not an issue for our radio maps due to the high angular resolution , and the stacked signal of a given sample was determined from the median combination of the galaxy postage stamps belonging to the sample .",
    "the mips @xmath22 stacks were determined in a similar way , despite the larger beam size . to ensure that our @xmath22 median stacks were not biased , we stacked samples of sfgs using the global deblending technique and found excellent agreement with the median results .",
    "the @xmath22 flux densities were measured on the stacked images using an aperture radius of 3.5@xmath49 with aperture corrections applied following the mips handbook . for the radio fluxes we adopted the central pixel values . in both cases the errors were estimated from the rms of the background in the stacked images .",
    "the stacked mips @xmath22 , _ herschel _ , and radio flux densities of the @xmath14- and @xmath13-bins of qgs are listed in table  [ table : stack ] .",
    "none of the qg samples are significantly detected ( i.e. , s / n @xmath52 ) in any of the _ herschel _ stacks .",
    "the most massive ( @xmath53 ) qgs are detected at all redshifts out to @xmath1 in the @xmath22 stacks ( s / n @xmath54 ) and out to @xmath44 in the radio stacks ( s / n @xmath55 ) .",
    "the intermediate - mass qgs ( @xmath56 ) are detected at @xmath22 ( s / n @xmath57 ) but not in the radio ( s / n @xmath58 ) in all relevant ( i.e. , mass - complete ) redshift bins .",
    "as expected , @xmath36 and @xmath59 decrease with @xmath14 ( cosmic dimming ) and increase with @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig : sed ] summarises our constraints on the seds of qgs at mid- , far - ir , and radio wavelengths along with the median uv - to - near - ir seds .",
    "note , the _ herschel _ non - detections are shown as @xmath46 upper limits ( i.e.  @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the map rms noise and @xmath62 the number of galaxies in the stack ) .",
    "for comparison we show the sed template of a dust - free elliptical galaxy @xcite scaled to match the uv - to - near - ir median photometry of the qgs ( figure [ fig : sed ] , left ) .",
    "the model , which represents pure stellar emission , is insufficient to fully account for the stacked @xmath22 flux densities .",
    "if we instead fit a modified black - body law ( see details in section [ sec : ms ] ) to the _ herschel _ limits , add radio emission ( a power - law with slope @xmath63 ) such that the radio - fir correlation @xcite is fulfilled , we still fall short of the stacked 1.4ghz fluxes ( figure [ fig : sed ] , right panels ) .",

    "independent @xmath64 upper limits are then obtained by redshifting and scaling a modified black - body model to the _ herschel _ @xmath46 upper limits using the idl code of @xcite .",
    "we use an optically thick , modified black - body law with a fixed dust temperature ( @xmath65 ) and emissivity 1.5 .",
    "note that @xmath64 is insensitive to @xmath66 , as it only varies by less than a factor of two if we assume @xmath67 or 50k instead . for each of our qg samples",
    ", @xmath64 is estimated in the above manner using the median @xmath33 ( listed in table  [ table : stack ] ) , and subsequently converted into an obscured sfr using the @xmath64-sfr calibration by @xcite adjusted to the imf used in this work . assuming that all the radio emission originates from sf , and a radio spectral index @xmath68 , rest - frame 1.4ghz luminosities ( @xmath69 ) are derived from the radio stacks and subsequently converted to sfr@xmath70 using the @xmath69-sfr calibration by @xcite .",
    "the _ herschel _ @xmath64 upper limits and the ( specific ) sfrs for qgs as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are listed in table  [ table : stack ] .",
    "the _ herschel _",
    "upper limits put stringent constraints on the dust - obscured sfr : @xmath71yr@xmath7 at @xmath72 and at most @xmath73yr@xmath7 , i.e. , ssfr @xmath74yr@xmath7 , across all @xmath14 and @xmath13 bins .",
    "these limits are consistent with the quiescence inferred from the unobscured sfr from uv - to - irac sed fits ( @xmath75 yr@xmath7 , see table  [ table : stack ] ) .",
    "qgs form stars at a very modest rate ( @xmath7610@xmath77 lower than sfgs , figure  [ fig : ms ] ) . as a consistency check",
    ", we find that the stacked _ herschel _ flux densities of sfgs obtained from global deblending and stacking @xcite are in good agreement with those from median combination , and we recover the sfr-@xmath13 sequence found in a recent compilation of similar measurements ( @xcite , figure  [ fig : ms ] ) .",
    "sfr@xmath51 are consistent with sfr@xmath78 , except at @xmath72 in which sfr@xmath51 is higher than sfr@xmath78 ( by as much as 5@xmath77 ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : ms ] .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by the following factors not related to recent sf : ( 1 ) the rayleigh - jeans tail of the stellar photospheric emission , which is dominated by red giants ; ( 2 ) circumstellar dust envelops of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite ; ( 3 ) interstellar ( cirrus ) dust heated by evolved stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 4 ) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission associated with ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) @xcite ; ( 5 ) warm dust heated by the obscured agn @xcite .",
    "the first four factors are viable for galaxies with intermediate - old stellar populations ( @xmath79gyr , @xcite )",
    ". the elliptical galaxy template from stellar population synthesis models @xcite , which accounts for only ( 1 ) and to some extend ( 2 ) , can not fully reproduce the observed @xmath36 at least for @xmath80 ( figure  [ fig : sed ] , left ) .",
    "this suggests that agn and/or dust heating from evolved stellar populations are likely responsible for the low levels of @xmath64 of qgs @xcite .",
    "the relative contribution of the above factors depends heavily on the evolution models of agb stars , dust grain models and interstellar radiation strength , which are actively debated and beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "while we can not discern the relative contributions of dust heating from these factors using the data in hand , we note that the sfr@xmath51 are likely upper limits if non - sf processes contribute significantly to @xmath36 .",
    "it is interesting that sfr@xmath70 is systematically higher than sfr inferred from @xmath22 and _ herschel _ as well as uv - to - irac sed fits , up to two orders of magnitude in the most extreme case .",
    "compared to the total ( obscured + unobscured ) sfr inferred from other indicators ( _ herschel _ , mips , uv - to - irac sed fitting ) , the median @xmath59 are inconsistent with originating from sf alone .",
    "this is reflected in the low radio index ( @xmath81 log(@xmath82 ) ) listed in table  [ table : stack ] compared to sfgs with typical values of 1.5  3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath69 [ w hz@xmath7 ] increases with redshift from @xmath84 at @xmath85 to @xmath86 at @xmath87 for the most massive qgs , where the radio excess is the most prominent ( see figure  [ fig : sed ] right panel insets ) . based on the fir - radio correlation presented in @xcite and including the radio - detected qgs in the stack",
    ", we estimate that 20 - 90% of @xmath69 arises from non - sf processes .",
    "this fraction is significantly higher for more massive qgs as shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] , although we note that if we adopt a more conservative _ herschel _ upper limit for the non - detection , the fraction will be lower .",
    "our results indicate that low - luminosity radio agn may be widespread among massive qgs , echoing the reciprocatory that massive qgs are the preferential hosts for low - luminosity radio agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , it is not straightforward to use the median stacked radio luminosity to constrain the heating rate of radio - agn feedback , without prior assumption of the duty cycle which is not well quantified .",
    "we reject the null hypothesis that the red colors of qgs are due to strong obscured sf , based on a deep fir stacking analysis .",
    "qgs have truly low sfrs and evolved stellar populations , as expected from their low unobscured sfrs measured from the uv continua .",
    "the average ssfrs of qgs are at least 1dex lower than those of sfgs out to @xmath1 .",
    "the stacked @xmath22 and radio emissions can not be completely accounted for by low levels of dust - obscured sfr nor stellar emissions , suggesting that low - luminosity agn may be present in qgs .    comparing with @xcite , who performed @xmath22 stacking on 309 qgs with @xmath88 ,",
    "our @xmath36 are slightly higher ( 526@xmath47jy vs 23@xmath47jy ) .",
    "their sample is drawn from a smaller survey area equivalent to 11% of the ultravista field , and therefore the discrepancy is likely explained by the fact that their sample is dominated by lower mass galaxies , which have lower @xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless , we arrive at similar conclusions  qgs do not host strong obscured sf , and dust heating by evolved stellar populations may be significant at the low levels of @xmath64 observed .",
    "our results indicate that @xmath39 qgs have average @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath90dex below the ulirg threshold .",
    "when we repeat our stacking analysis including qgs detected at @xmath22 following the definition of @xcite , we obtain higher stacked mid- and far - ir emission , in broad agreement with their results .",
    "as qgs have higher @xmath22 and _ herschel _ detection fractions at @xmath39 ( up to 19% and 6% , respectively , see table  [ table : detfrac ] and section  [ sec : data ] ) , the inclusion of the quoted fractions of @xmath91 sources boosts the stacked fir emission of massive qgs at @xmath39 to be comparable to ulirgs .",
    "we reaffirm that a population of truly quiescent galaxies is already in place by @xmath1 .",
    "this corroborates the need for powerful quenching mechanisms to terminate star formation in galaxies . while environmental quenching may be dominant for intermediate - mass qgs @xcite ,",
    "stacking analyses at radio ( this work ) and x - ray @xcite wavelengths reveal that massive qgs harbor low - luminosity agn .",
    "agn provide a viable mechanism for quenching sf in galaxies , as supported by the enhanced agn fraction among transitory objects between sfgs and qgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after galaxies are quenched , the agn may then proceed to `` maintenance mode '' suppressing further sf through a feedback cycle @xcite . with upcoming surveys it will be possible to conduct a complete census of agn to sample the entire feedback duty cycle and constrain their energetics , in order to quantify their role in quenching star formation in galaxies .",
