    "they undergo a deconfinement transition , signalled by a finite expectation value of the trace of the polyakov loop .    according to the 15 years old svetitsky - yaffe conjecture  @xcite , the d - dimensional effective statistical model for the polyakov loops has an action ( hamiltonian ) with short range interactions and a global symmetry group given by the center of su(n ) .",
    "if both the deconfining phase transition of the gauge model and of the corresponding order - disorder phase transition of the spin system are continuous , the two models belong to the same universality class .",
    "the conjecture that the deconfinement transition of 4d su(2 ) lgt belongs to the 3d ising universality class is supported by analytical calculations , and numerical estimates of its critical indices , c.f .",

    "we tested the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture by comparing flows of block spin effective actions for the polyakov loops with flows of the 3d ising model .",
    "approach of both flows to a single trajectory ending in a common renormalization group fixed point demonstrates universality on a fundamental level .",
    "our procedure to generate and analyse block spin effective actions for polyakov loops consists of the following steps .",
    "* map the su(2 ) configurations @xmath2 living on an @xmath3 lattice to ising configurations @xmath4 on an @xmath5 lattice .",
    "the ising variables are given by the signs of the polyakov loops .",

    "compute the effective coupling constants using imcrg  @xcite . *",
    "generate a renormalization group flow by increasing the block size @xmath6 .",
    "* compare the resulting flow with that computed directly in the ising model .",
    "more formally , the effective action for the signs of the polyakov loops is given by @xmath7= \\int du~ p(\\mu , u)~\\exp[-s_{\\rm g}(u ) ] \\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath8.\\ ] ] here , @xmath9 is the standard wilson action for su(2 ) . in case of an even block size @xmath6 the sum of the ising spins @xmath10 inside a block @xmath11 can be zero . in that case",
    "a positive ( negative ) @xmath12 is selected with probability one half .",
    "unfortunately , effective hamiltonians contain an infinite number of coupling constants . in practical calculations",
    "one has to truncate to a finite set of interactions .",
    "we chose to include in the ansatz eight 2-point couplings and six 4-point couplings .",
    "the 2-point couplings can be labelled by specifying the relative position of the interacting spins ( up to obvious symmetries ) : our couplings @xmath13 then correspond to 001,011,111,002,012,112,022,122 .",
    "the 4-point couplings @xmath14 are defined through fig .  1 .",
    "the corresponding interaction terms in the effective hamiltonian are denoted by @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "1 . definition of the 4-point - couplings .",
    "translating the rationale of imcrg  @xcite to the present context means that one does _ not _ simulate standard su(2 ) model but instead the system with partition function @xmath17 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a guess for @xmath19 .",
    "note the _ plus _ sign in front of @xmath20 .",
    "as before , @xmath21 denote the block spins , defined on blocks of size @xmath6 obtained from blocking the polyakov loops .",
    "the crucial observation is now that if @xmath22 , i.e. , if the guess of the hamiltonian is right , then the @xmath12 decouple completely .",
    "this means in particular that the correlations @xmath23 vanish .",
    "a non - perfect guess can be improved by iteration of @xmath24 where @xmath25 are trivial multiplicity factors .",
    "a few iterations of this correction step usually suffice to obtain good precision for the effective couplings .",
    "this method , though it seems to be restricted to ising type models , has several merits .",
    "one of them is the following : for small enough blocks , the autocorrelations in the simulations are drastically reduced .",
    "this follows from the fact that in case of perfect compensation the blocks completely decouple and fluctuate independently . in the su(2 ) imcrg calculations discussed below this phenomenon was clearly observed  @xcite .",
    "we started by computing the flow of the critical 3d ising model , using two different models .",
    "the standard ising model with nearest neighbour couplings becomes critical at @xmath26 .",
    "a version `` @xmath27 '' which includes also third ( cube - diagonal ) neighbour couplings has a critical point at @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "we then turned to ft su(2 ) with @xmath30 .",
    "we computed the effective actions from simulations on lattices consisting of @xmath31 blocks of size @xmath32 .",
    "the simulations were performed at @xmath33 .",
    "best matching with the ising data was achieved at @xmath34 .",
    "the flow of @xmath35 and @xmath36 for this gauge coupling is shown in fig .  2 , together with the ising flows .",
    "the gauge data are displayed with squares , the ising results are shown with bars , diamonds and dotted fit lines .",
    "the fits were done with a simple power law  @xcite . a nice matching",
    "is observed also for the 12 couplings not shown here .",
    "note that the block sizes of the various models have to be rescaled with respect to each other in order to yield matching .",
    "e.g. , the @xmath6 from the @xmath27 model have to be rescaled by a factor of 0.59 with respect to that of the standard ising model .",
    "let us finally show a comparison of the flow of the nearest neighbour coupling for different gauge couplings .",
    "this is shown in fig .  3 .",
    "the dashed line , together with diamonds and crosses , gives the ising flow .",
    "the other data ( from top to bottom ) correspond to @xmath37 ( triangles ) , 1.877 ( crosses ) , 1.774 ( squares ) , and 1.771 ( stars ) .",
    "the gauge block sizes are rescaled such that best matching is obtained for @xmath38 . within the given precision ,",
    "also the @xmath39 data could be rescaled to match the ising flow .",
