    "we have previously @xcite described the initial observations of the near - nucleus coma of comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko made by the alice far - ultraviolet imaging spectrograph onboard _",
    "rosetta _ made in the first few months following orbit insertion in august 2014 .",
    "these observations of the sunward limb , made from distances between 10 and 30 km from the comet s nucleus , showed emissions of atomic hydrogen , oxygen , and carbon , spatially localized close to the nucleus and attributed to photoelectron impact dissociation of  and  vapor . this interpretation is supported by measurements of suprathermal electrons by the ion and electron sensor ( ies ) instrument on _ rosetta _ @xcite .",
    "beginning in february 2015 , as the activity of the comet increased , the orbit of _ rosetta _ was adjusted to increasing distance from the nucleus due to concerns for spacecraft safety . at distances",
    "@xmath150  km , when pointed towards the nadir , the spatial extent along the alice 5.5  long slit @xcite allows the coma , both sunward and anti - sunward , to be resolved from the nucleus and observed nearly continuously .",
    "this geometry allowed alice , beginning in mid - april 2015 , to observe a number of outbursts above the sunward limb .",
    "these outbursts are characterized by sudden increases in the atomic emissions , particularly the semi - forbidden @xmath01356 multiplet , over a period of 10 - 30 minutes , without a corresponding enhancement in long wavelength solar reflected light characteristic of dust production .",
    "the corresponding increase in the brightness ratio @xmath01356/ @xmath01304 suggests that , detected for the first time in a comet by @xcite , is the primary source of the additional gas .",
    "this is the same spectroscopic diagnostic used to determine that  is the dominant species in the exospheres of europa and ganymede @xcite .",
    "as the comet rotates the alice slit samples different regions above the comet s limb , but the magnitude of the increase on the short time scale as well as the spatial distribution along the slit makes it very unlikely that it is due to a spatial gradient or a collimated `` jet '' .",
    "although @xmath01657 is also seen to increase , the variation in the brightness ratio @xmath01356/ @xmath01657 indicates that it can not be  alone , nor can the effects be due to an increase in photoelectron flux .",
    "these outbursts do not correlate with any of the visible images of outbursts taken with either osiris @xcite or the navigation camera .",
    "we also find that co does not appear to be driving any of the observed outbursts .",
    "alice is a lightweight , low - power , imaging spectrograph designed for in situ far - ultraviolet imaging spectroscopy of comet 67p in the spectral range 700 - 2050   .",
    "the slit is in the shape of a dog bone , 5.5  long , with a width of 0.05  in the central 2.0 , while the ends are 0.10  wide , giving a spectral resolution between 8 and 12    for extended sources that fill its field - of - view .",
    "each spatial pixel or row along the slit is 0.30  long .",
    "details of the instrument have been given by @xcite .",
    "the strongest of the outbursts , from the period may - july 2015 , are listed in table  [ gas ] .",
    "the table includes the heliocentric distance of the comet , @xmath2 , the distance of _ rosetta _ from the center of the comet , @xmath3 , the sub - spacecraft longitude and latitude , and the solar phase angle at the time of observation . with the exception of the june 18 and june 23 outbursts , the sub - spacecraft positions of the tabulated outburst are uncorrelated , attesting to their random nature .",
    "as an example we will consider in detail the outburst of may 23 since the pointing was constant over two rotations of the comet enabling us to obtain nearly continuous light curves except for gaps in the data due to a lack of observations during spacecraft maintenance activities .",
    "light curves for the strongest coma emissions are shown in fig .",
    "[ light_curve ] .",
    "note that prior to the outburst the relative intensities of lyman-@xmath4 , @xmath01304 , and @xmath01356 , are consistent with the earlier observations that attributed the emissions primarily to electron dissociative excitation of   @xcite .",
    "one rotation period ( @xmath512  h ) later both the absolute and relative brightnesses have returned to their pre - outburst values ,     statistical uncertainty for all points is @xmath65% .",
    "the bottom panel shows the variation in relative intensities of these emissions .",

    "the sun is towards the top of the image .",
    "the spectral image in fig .  [ nav1 ] ( right ) shows the clearly separated coma emissions together with the reflected solar spectrum from the nucleus in rows 11 to 17 of the slit .",

[ may23_4spec ] .",
    "these correspond to rows 18 to 21 of the spectral image in fig  [ nav1 ] . the difference between the spectra at the peak of the outburst and the prior spectra is then indicative of the erupting gas .",
    "the difference spectrum , shown in the right panel , is characterized by an enhancement in the atomic emissions , particularly atomic oxygen , without a corresponding enhancement in long wavelength solar reflected light characteristic of dust production .",
    "the large increase in @xmath01356/ @xmath01304 ( intensity ratio @xmath11:1 ) suggests , now known to be present in the cometary ice of 67p @xcite , as the primary source of the additional gas .",
    "however , laboratory data on the electron impact dissociative excitation of  @xcite suggests that this ratio should be @xmath52 , as seen in the exospheric spectra of europa @xcite and ganymede @xcite . the observed ratio varies in the other outbursts listed in table  [ gas ] and",
    "likely reflects additional sources of @xmath01304 such as photodissociation of   @xcite or electron impact on o ( if present ) .",
    "the dramatic change in relative intensities implies that the outburst can not be due to a sudden increase in photoelectron flux or change in the electron energy distribution . for may 23 this",
    "is borne out by data from rpc / ies @xcite that shows only a modest uniform increase in electron flux beginning about two hours before the outburst observed by alice and lasting for 12 hours ( k. mandt , private communication ) .",
    "a significant amount of  is also released as evidenced by the presence of lyman-@xmath7 and lyman-@xmath4 in the difference spectrum .",
    "if we ignore the blending of lyman-@xmath4 with @xmath01027 , also produced by e+  @xcite , and assume that all of the emission at 1026    is lyman-@xmath4 , then we can use the e+  cross section for lyman-@xmath4 at 100  ev from @xcite relative to the e+  cross section for @xmath01356 from @xcite to estimate the relative /  abundance in the outburst . from the relative fluxes in the difference spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ may23_4spec ] ) we find /  @xmath1  0.5 , considerably greater than the mean quiescent value of 0.038 reported by @xcite . the presence of  in the outburst is confirmed by concurrent sub - mm measurements of the  column density by miro @xcite along a line - of - sight contiguous with the central row of the alice slit that showed a threefold increase at the same time ( p. von allmen , private communication ) , .",
    "co began to appear regularly in alice coma spectra in june 2015 and continues to be present through early 2016 .",
    "while not detected in the may 23 spectrum the co fourth positive system is seen in several other spectra listed in table  [ gas ] .",
    "however , it does not appear in any of the difference spectra and thus is unlikely to be the major driver in any of the outbursts presented here .",
    "the origin of the @xmath01657 emission in the difference spectrum is not clear .",
    "electron impact on c  would produce emission at 1561   with an intensity about half that of @xmath01657 @xcite as well as co cameron band emission at longer wavelengths which is not observed .",
    "other carbon bearing molecules are not precluded as a source .",
    "additional information about the outburst can be obtained from the profiles of the emissions along the slit .",
    "[ may23_spatial ] shows the profiles of @xmath01304 and @xmath01356 for the four spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ may23_4spec ] .",
    "both profiles peak just above the sunward limb and decrease radially outward .",
    "the brightness increases nearly uniformly in each successive 10 minute integration . with an outflow velocity of 0.5 km  s@xmath8",
    "the escaping  molecules will exit the alice field - of - view in @xmath510 seconds , so the ejection is continuous . from the light curve",
    "we see that one rotation later ( @xmath512 h ) , at the same sub - spacecraft longitude , the emission has returned to its quiescent level .",
    "emission is seen against the nucleus and off the anti - sunward limb , indicating that the outburst is not in the form of a collimated jet but is rather diffuse . as noted above",
    ", any dust produced would have been detected by an increase at long wavelengths of reflected solar radiation .",
    "for the other dates in table  [ gas ] , the light curves , difference spectra , and spatial profiles are all similar to those of the may 23 event .",
    "a search through the alice database for earlier events reveals multiple outbursts with similar spectra on 2015 april 15 and april 29/30 .",
    "prior to april , the geometry for observing outbursts ( closer distance to the nucleus ) was less favorable .",
    "in april the spacecraft was at southern latitudes but the longitudes of the outbursts was also random .",
    "the rate of detected gas outburst events decreased after perihelion on 2015 august 13 .",
    "post - perihelion observations , through the present , continue to show variable @xmath01356/ @xmath01304 intensity ratios although these measurements are not always confined to the short time scales of the `` outburst '' events described above .",
    "these observations provide a means of monitoring the /  abundance in the coma even when _ rosetta _ is at large distances ( @xmath1100 km ) from the nucleus , complementing rosina measurements closer to the comet .",
    "a likely source of gas outbursts is the warming of sub - surface volatile reservoirs as the comet approaches perihelion .",
    "water ice containing frozen , as has been proposed for the surface of ganymede @xcite , would reside below the dust mantle .",
    "sublimated , together with some , would then percolate through the porous mantle and diffuse into the coma taking some of the dust with it .",
    "the coupling of dust to gas sublimated from sub - surface ice has been studied by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for 67p , @xcite consider only co , , and  ices",
    ".  has a sublimation temperature and pressure comparable to those for co @xcite so that the co models should similarly apply .",
    "the absence of dust in the outbursts observed by alice suggests a different scenario .",
    "@xcite , seeking to explain a narrow , short - lived dust outburst observed by the osiris imager , has proposed a deepening of a pre - existing fracture that would lead to the exposure of a sub - surface ice layer and a subsequent rapid ejection of gas and dust .",
    "although @xcite considered a model with co ice , their calculations should also be valid for .",
    "a narrow very short - lived dust jet would be missed by the alice slit , while the high density of the escaping gas would collisionally be distributed throughout the coma .",
    "we report here the detection by the alice far - ultraviolet spectrograph on _ rosetta _ of a number of sporadic gas outbursts above the sunward limb .",
    "these outbursts are characterized by sudden increases in the emissions of atomic h and o over a period of 10 - 30 minutes , without a corresponding enhancement in long wavelength solar reflected light characteristic of dust production .",
    "the emissions are seen to decay over a period of several hours , returning to their quiescent level after a complete rotation of the comet .",
    "spectroscopic analysis of the ejected gas suggests  as the principal driver of the additional gas .",
    "these outbursts do not correlate with any of the visible images of outbursts taken with either osiris or the navigation camera .",
    "a complete accounting of both pre- and post - perihelion events will be presented in a future publication .",
