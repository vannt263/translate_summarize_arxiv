    "<S> we study and constrain the parameter space of the vector color - octet model from the observed data at the tevatron by studying the top quark pair production and associated observables @xmath0and spin - correlation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we study the invariant mass and rapidity dependence of @xmath0at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the flavor conserving ( fc ) couplings we extend our study to include the flavor violating ( fv ) coupling involving the first and third generation quarks for both these processes . in order to ensure that we remain within the constraints imposed by the lhc data , </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the charge asymmetry , @xmath1 spectrum and invariant mass in the @xmath2 production data at the lhc . the constraints from the dijet resonance searches performed by the lhc are also considered . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore the contribution of this model to the single top quark production mediated by charged and neutral color - octet vector bosons . </S>",
    "<S> fv couplings introduced then induce the same - sign top - pair production process which is analyzed for both the hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we have incorporated the effect of finite decay width of color octets on these processes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is possible to explain the observed @xmath0anomaly in the color - octet vector model without transgressing the production cross sections of all these processes both through fc and fv couplings at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> we predict best point sets in the model parameter space for specific choices of color - octet masses corresponding to @xmath3 evaluated using the @xmath4   and @xmath5spectrum of @xmath0from the observed data set of run ii of the tevatron at the integrated luminosity @xmath6  fb@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the single top quark production is more sensitive to the fc and fv couplings in comparison to the top - pair production . </S>",
    "<S> we provide 95 % exclusion contours on the plane of fv chiral couplings from the recent data at the tevatron , cms and atlas corresponding to the nonobservability of large same - sign dilepton events . </S>",
    "<S> the four observed point sets are consistent with the cross section , charge asymmetry and spin - correlation measurements for @xmath2 production and dijet searches at the lhc . </S>"
