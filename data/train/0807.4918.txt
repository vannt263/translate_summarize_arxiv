    "@xmath0 violation in the standard model is associated with the ckm matrix  @xcite , which arises from the charged @xmath6 transition .",
    "three generations of quarks lead to a @xmath7 unitary matrix @xmath8 with four independent parameters : three mixing angles and one imaginary phase , and the phase is the source of @xmath0 violation in the standard model .",
    "the wolfenstein parametrization of the ckm matrix is useful  @xcite @xmath9 the unitarity property of the ckm matrix gives six unitarity triangles .",
    "for example , if we apply unitarity to the first and third columns , we get the following equation @xmath10 which can be represented as a triangle in the complex plane as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : triangle ] ( left ) .",
    "the ckm mechanism predicts a sizable angle @xmath11 since all the three sides are at the same order of @xmath12 .",
    "this angle can be cleanly measured in the @xmath13 decay through the time dependent @xmath0 asymmetry .",
    "the large angle is an indication of large @xmath0 violation in the @xmath14 systems , which was verified in 2001  @xcite .",
    "if unitarity is applied to the second and third columns , another equation is obtained @xmath15 which also corresponds to a triangle in the complex plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] ( right ) .",
    "however , two sides of this triangle are at order of @xmath12 , and the third side is only at order of @xmath16 .",
    "this leads to a very small angle ( @xmath17 ) defined as @xmath18 this angle can be cleanly measured in the decay @xmath19 .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath0 violation phase @xmath3 is thus very interesting and any significant non - zero result could be an indication of new physics beyond the standard model .",

    "a @xmath26 vertex is formed from all the daughter tracks .",
    "after some loose pre - selection ( transverse momentum cut ) , the data are selected by an artificial neural network ( nn ) .",
    "the network needs to be trained before being applied to the data . to separate signal and combinatorial background events , both signal and background samples",
    "are provided to the neural network for the training .",
    "the signal sample is obtained from monte carlo simulation , while the background sample is obtained from the @xmath26 mass sideband region .",
    "the variables used for training mainly include : vertex fit probability at each vertex , transverse momentum of @xmath26 and daughter tracks , and particle identification information for kaon candidates .",
    "the neural network assigns a numerical output value for each event in the data sample , and a nn output cut is chosen to optimize the figure of merit : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are number of signal and background events in the defined signal mass region . with 1.35  fb@xmath2 of luminosity , we get about 2000 signal events .",

    "to observe any time dependent @xmath0 asymmetry , we need to measure the decay rates of both @xmath26 and @xmath30 .",
    "this requires proper decay time measurement with excellent resolution in order to resolve the fast oscillation of the differential rates , and the measurement of final state decay angles to separate different @xmath0 eigenstates .",
    "in addition , we need to develop algorithms to identify the flavor of the @xmath26 meson at the production time .      the distance @xmath31 between the primary vertex ( @xmath26 produced ) and the secondary vertex ( @xmath26 decays ) is the decay length measured in the lab frame .",
    "the primary vertex is reconstructed on an event by event basis with average uncertainty around @xmath32 . to the",
    "get decay time in the @xmath26 rest frame , the projected decay length on the @xmath33 plane ( perpendicular to the beamline ) is used .",
    "the proper decay length is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the light speed , @xmath36 is @xmath26 pdg mass and @xmath37 is the reconstructed @xmath26 transverse momentum . with large drift chamber and silicon vertex tracking system close to the beamline , the @xmath38 resolution is excellent at cdf ( @xmath39 ) , which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ( right ) .",
    "since @xmath26 is a pseudo - scalar meson , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are both vector mesons , the final states form a admixture of @xmath0 eigenstates , where @xmath28 and @xmath40 waves are @xmath0 even , while @xmath41 wave is @xmath0 odd .",
    "to separate the two @xmath0 eigenstates , we analyze the angular distribution in the transversity basis . in this basis",
    ", the final state consists of three orthogonal polarization states , such that the two final state vector mesons are either longitudinally polarized , transversely polarized and perpendicular to each other , or transversely polarized and parallel to each other .",

    "two types of tagging algorithms are used at cdf .",
    "the first algorithm tags the @xmath45 quark that produces the @xmath26 candidate in the sample , which is called same side tagging ( sst ) .",
    "the other algorithm , known as opposite side tagging ( ost ) , tags the other quark . on the near side ,",

    "a charged kaon is not always available , and has a background from charged pions . on the away side ,",
    "both the oscillation of neutral @xmath29 mesons and the sequential decay of @xmath45 quark lead to incorrect flavor identification .",
