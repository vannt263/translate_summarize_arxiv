    "ferrimagnets , which occur rather frequently in nature , are somehow between the antiferromagnets and the ferromagnets . despite the fact that the homogeneous integer spin chains show the haldane gap in their low energy spectrum and the half - integer ones are gapless @xcite , 1d ferrimagnets behave differently .",
    "the lowest energy band of the 1d ferrimagnets is gapless which shows a ferromagnetic behavior while there is a finite gap to the next band above it which has the antiferromagnetic properties @xcite .",
    "it is the acoustical and optical nature of excitations which is the result of two different type of spins in each unit cell .",
    "this behavior has been observed in the low and high temperature regime of quantum ferrimagnets @xcite .",
    "there are many approaches to study the properties of the ferrimagnetic chains ; the dual features of ferrimagnetic excitations can be illuminated by using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods@xcite .",
    "numerical diagonalization , combined with lanczos algorithm@xcite and the scaling technique@xcite , further have been applied to study the modern topics such as the phase transition@xcite and the quantized magnetization plateau .",
    "the discovery of both ferromagnetic gapless and antiferromagnetic gapped excitations have led to the investigation of the thermodynamic properties .",
    "it has been predicted that the specific heat at high temperatures should behave like an antiferromagnet@xcite which exhibit a schottky peak at the intermediate temperatures .",
    "the modified spin wave theory ( mswt ) and qmc can be used to see this behavior however , qmc is not able to reach low temperatures sufficiently , to completely demonstrate the ferromagnetic behavior@xcite .",
    "most of the mentioned techniques such as qmc and dmrg have been used for ferrimagnets with small spins .",
    "the hilbert space of large spins are growing exponentially and makes the computations more difficult . in recent years",
    "there are considerable attempts which has been focusing on the properties of new magnetic materials , such as magnetic molecules with large effective spins ( @xmath8 ) , or intermetallic compounds containing magnetic layers or chains . using mswt@xcite and high temperature series expansion ( htse)@xcite",

    "moreover , the htse is not enough accurate even by taking into account higher terms ( 11th and 7th term for specific heat and susceptibility , respectively ) .",
    "in addition the validity regime of htse is too far from the low temperature regime of mswt to cover the full range of temperature .",
    "the mid temperature behavior of ferrimagnets with large values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , has not received sufficient attention . in this respect",

    "we have also implemented the qmc simulation@xcite as an accurate result for comparison . at moderate temperatures , i.e @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the exchange coupling ) the results of mswt do not coincide with qmc ones . therefore , to describe the physical properties at mid temperatures we have employed the cumulant expansion ( ce ) @xcite .",
    "recently , this method has been used to study the finite temperature behavior of large spin ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems @xcite .    in this article",

    "the effective hamiltonian and magnetization in the presence of the magnetic field are obtained using the ce up to the second order of @xmath13 . in sec.[sec3 ] the results and discussions have been demonstrated .",

    "<S> we have implemented three approaches to describe the thermodynamic properties of ferrimagnetic ( @xmath0 ) spin chains . </S>",
    "<S> the application of cumulant expansion has been generalized to the ferrimagnetic chain in the presence of an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> using cumulants , we have obtained the field dependent effective hamiltonian in terms of the classical variables up to the second order of quantum corrections . </S>",
    "<S> thermodynamic functions , the internal energy , the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility are obtained from the effective hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we have also examined the modified spin wave theory to derive the same physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have studied our model using quantum monte carlo simulation to obtain accurate results . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the above results and also the high temperature series expansion shows that cumulant expansion gives good results for moderate and high temperature regions while the modified spin wave theory is good for low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the convergence regions of the cumulant expansion and the modified spin wave theory overlap each other which propose these two as a set of complement methods to get the thermodynamic properties of spin models . </S>"
