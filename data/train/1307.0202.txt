    "dengue is a major public health problem in tropical and sub - tropical countries .",
    "it is a vector - borne disease transmitted by _",
    "aedes aegypti _ and _ aedes albopictus _ mosquitoes .",
    "four different serotypes can cause dengue fever .",
    "a human infected by one serotype , when recovers , gains total immunity to that serotype , and only partial and transient immunity with respect to the other three .",
    "dengue can vary from mild to severe .",
    "the more severe forms of dengue include shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever ( dhf ) .",
    "patients who develop these more serious forms of dengue fever usually need to be hospitalized .",
    "the full life cycle of dengue fever virus involves the role of the mosquito as a transmitter ( or vector ) and humans as the main victim and source of infection .",
    "preventing or reducing dengue virus transmission depends entirely in the control of mosquito vectors or interruption of human - vector contact @xcite .    in section  [ sec:2 ] an epidemiological model for dengue disease",
    "is presented .",
    "it consists of six mutually - exclusive compartments , expressing the interaction between human and mosquito , and designed for examining the process of the disease spread into a population .    similarly to humans ,",
    "mosquitoes differ among themselves in terms of their life history traits .",
    "besides individual variations , the environment ( temperature and humidity ) also has strong effect on the life history @xcite .",
    "another source of uncertainties , regarding appropriate parameter values , is the scarcity of the data available for the mosquito population , and the diversity among the international data .",
    "our model includes a set of parameters related to human and mosquito populations and their interaction .",
    "often the unknown parameters involved in the models are assumed to be constant over time .",
    "however , in a more realistic perspective of any phenomenon , some of them are not constant and implicitly depend on several factors .",
    "many of such factors usually do not appear explicitly in the mathematical models because of the need of balance between modeling and numerical tractability and the lack of a precise knowledge of them @xcite .",
    "sensitivity analysis allows to investigate how uncertainty in the input variables affects the model outputs and which input variables tend to drive variation in the outputs .",
    "sensitivity of the basic reproduction number for a tuberculosis model can be found in @xcite .",
    "here one of the goals is to determine which parameters are worth pursuing in the field in order to develop a dengue transmission model . for our specific model",
    ", a sensitivity analysis is performed in section  [ subsection_sensitivity ] to determine the relative importance of the model parameters to disease transmission , taking into account the basic reproduction number ( section  [ sec:3 ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] reports some numerical experiments : a set of simulations is presented to illustrate the effect of the parameters on the number of infected individuals .",
    "finally , some conclusions are given in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "taking into account the model presented in @xcite and the considerations of @xcite , a new model more adapted to the dengue reality is proposed .",
    "the notation used in the mathematical model includes three epidemiological states for humans :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ cols= \" < \" , ]     a highly sensitive parameter should be carefully estimated , because a small variation in that parameter will lead to large quantitative changes .",
    "an insensitive parameter , on the other hand , does not require as much effort to estimate , since a small variation in that parameter will not produce large changes to the quantity of interest @xcite .",
    "the simulations were carried out using the following values for the initial conditions : @xmath0 the final time was @xmath1 days .",
    "computations were run in with the ` ode45 ` routine",
    ". this function implements a runge  kutta method with a variable time step for efficient computation .",
    "figures  [ human ] and [ mosquito ] show the solutions to  with the baseline parameter values given in table  [ parameters ] , for human and mosquitoes , respectively .",
    "figure  [ increased ] shows a set of graphics that reflects the effects on the disease through parameters variation .",
    "each graphic presents the number of infected humans using the baseline parameter values ( solid line ) described in table  [ parameters ] and the corresponding curves with a specific parameter increase of @xmath2 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the obtained graphics reinforce the sensitivity analysis made in section  [ subsection_sensitivity ] . some parameters , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , present residual sensitivity indices having small influence in @xmath6 and the changes are not graphically perceptible .",
    "the most positive sensitive parameter is the mosquito biting rate , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 ( see figure  [ b ] ) .",
    "figures  [ beta_mh ] , [ eta_a ] and [ k ] reflect the same behavior as the previous one with respect to @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 parameters , respectively . as",
    "the sensitivity index for @xmath12 is equal to the @xmath9 , and its effect in the infected humans is similar , the graphic is omitted .",
    "for all these five parameters the positive signal in the sensitivity indices of @xmath6 agrees with our intuition .    the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 have a negative sensitivity index .",
    "the most negative sensitive parameter is the average lifespan of adult mosquitoes , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are increased @xmath2 , then the basic reproduction number @xmath6 decreases approximately 5% and 10% , respectively .",
    "in this situation the infected humans also decrease accordingly , as can be seen in figures  [ eta_h_increased ] and [ mu_m ] .",
    "figure  [ all ] presents the comparison of the infected humans when the original parameters are considered and all the parameters are increased 10% .",

    "a dengue model was studied by evaluating the sensitivity indices of the basic reproduction number , @xmath6 , in order to determine the relative importance of the model parameters in the disease transmission .",

    "such analysis can provide critical information for decision makers and public health officials , who may have to deal with the reality of an infectious disease .",
