    "<S> we demonstrate tunable frequency - converted light mediated by a @xmath0 nonlinear photonic crystal nanocavity . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength - scale inp - based cavity supports two closely - spaced localized modes near 1550 nm which are resonantly excited by a 130 fs laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity is simultaneously irradiated with a non - resonant probe beam , giving rise to rich second - order scattering spectra reflecting nonlinear mixing of the different resonant and non - resonant components . in particular , we highlight the radiation at the sum frequencies of the probe beam and the respective cavity modes . </S>",
    "<S> this would be a useful , minimally - invasive monitor of the joint occupancy state of multiple cavities in an integrated optical circuit .    </S>",
    "<S> to realize all - optical logic on an integrated semiconductor chip , it is necessary to develop a toolkit of logical operations ( gates ) which can manipulate optical signals . </S>",
    "<S> these operations serve to generate , condition , and detect optical signals , and are most naturally applied in cavities , where photons can be localized for many optical cycles . </S>",
    "<S> recent work has demonstrated that photonic crystal nanocavities can be fabricated with @xmath1 factors greater than @xmath2 , and are thus capable of storing photons for more than 1 nanosecond  @xcite and realizing one - bit delays in bit streams of data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cavities can also serve as channel drop filters to transfer a signal from one waveguide to another  @xcite .    in both classical and quantum optical protocols </S>",
    "<S> , the ability to perform conditional logic requires nonlinear functionality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent advances on this front include all - optical switching via bistability and free - carrier tuning  @xcite , dynamic @xmath1 factor control for the release of photons on demand  @xcite , and adiabatic frequency conversion through the perturbation of cavity modes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter approach is effective for generating small frequency shifts in an optical mode , but for larger shifts , the nonlinearity of the material can be exploited to generate new harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical work has shown that , in principle , loss - less harmonic generation is feasible in doubly - resonant @xmath0 and @xmath3 cavities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , we have shown in our previous work that second - harmonic generation and sum - frequency generation are possible at microwatt - scale powers by leveraging the high @xmath1 factor and small mode volume of a photonic crystal nanocavity  @xcite .    to perform conditional logic , </S>",
    "<S> it is important to be able to monitor mode occupation in a cavity . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we use nonlinear mode mixing in a photonic crystal nanocavity to demonstrate a method to monitor the populations of modes in _ different _ cavities in a weakly perturbative fashion . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment involves conditionally generating a signal dependent both on the occupation of one microcavity mode ( or many ) and the overlapping presence of a transient ( non - resonant ) signal in the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to serving as a joint - state monitor , this technique could be used to generate new signals at a frequency of choice .    </S>",
    "<S> schematic optical circuit for the joint state nonlinear monitor . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) cavity 1 drops channel @xmath4 from a multi - mode waveguide . ( 2 ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is coupled into cavity 2 ( non - resonantly ) . </S>",
    "<S> cavity 2 supports two resonant modes , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and when @xmath4 arrives , ( 3 ) new frequencies are conditionally generated at @xmath7 and/or @xmath8 , depending on the population of cavity 2 . </S>",
    "<S> , width=226 ]    our experiment is motivated by the schematic optical circuit of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tune ] . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows two cavities , * 1 * and * 2 * , with * 1 * acting as a single mode channel drop filter  @xcite , and * 2 * acting to store photons at frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> signal @xmath4 is dropped from a multi - mode channel through the microcavity filter and into the middle waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> when signal @xmath4 reaches cavity * 2 * , it can interact with modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 via the material second - order nonlinearity of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> new signals are generated at @xmath9 and/or @xmath10 that are conditional on the combined occupation state of cavities * 1 * and * 2*. our experiment illustrates the nonlinear physics involved in generating these conditional signals .    the slab which hosts the two - mode phc nanocavity is a 230 nm thick [ 001]-oriented inp free - standing membrane mounted on a glass substrate . </S>",
    "<S> it is excited by a train of @xmath11 130 fs pulses from a 80 mhz optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) ( spectra physics ) with a bandwidth of 100 @xmath12 and an average power of 60 @xmath13w that is focussed through a 100@xmath14 microscope objective . </S>",
    "<S> using our well - established technique  @xcite , the resonantly scattered light is collected in reflection , and detected in the cross - polarization with respect to the incident beam using a bomem fourier transform infrared spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> the second - order radiation is collected in transmission using a 40@xmath14 ( na=0.65 ) microscope objective , and detected using a grating spectrometer and a liquid - nitrogen cooled ccd detector .    , width=226 ]    we first consider the _ resonant _ linear and nonlinear response of the cavity ( taken to be cavity * 2 * in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tune ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the whole spectrum is excited simultaneously due to the wide bandwidth of the opo , and the modes show up as resonant peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the linear spectrum is shown in blue in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2mode](b ) , clearly revealing the two modes of interest . </S>",
    "<S> these modes are nt part of the usual in - bandgap spectrum of the l3-cavity , but rather are quasi - localized modes in the dielectric band continuum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they suit our purposes well because of their close spectral spacing ( which allows simultaneous excitation by a single short pulse ) and relatively high @xmath1 factors . the nonlinear spectrum , superimposed on the same plot for comparison purposes , </S>",
    "<S> is shown in red . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest and highest energy peaks are at exactly twice the frequencies of the microcavity modes evident in the linear spectra , and the central sharp feature , at 2 @xmath14 6315 @xmath12 , is at precisely their sum frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the extra peak at the sum frequency therefore corresponds to the second - order nonlinear interaction of fields resonant in the two modes , and suggests an application . in an integrated optical circuit , detection of this second - order radiation </S>",
    "<S> using narrow band filters would provide a weak , non - destructive means of monitoring the joint occupation state of the microcavity , providing a logical and gate operation . </S>",
    "<S> although this functionality is demonstrated here in the case where a single short pulse is used to simultaneously populate the two modes , the sum - frequency signature would also occur if the modes were populated by independent sources .    to demonstrate the conditional mode monitoring operation , we simultaneously irradiate the cavity with short , resonant pulses ( as above ) and a second _ non - resonant _ excitation beam consisting of longer , picosecond pulses tuned far off resonance with the cavity modes . </S>",
    "<S> this two - color source is readily available from the unfiltered `` signal '' beam output of the opo when it is tuned near the degeneracy point ( where both signal and idler frequencies are close to half the pump frequency ) . </S>",
    "<S> an example of this unfiltered spectrum when the signal is tuned to 6335 @xmath12 is shown in figure  [ fig : sigidler](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the short opo signal pulses are accompanied by relatively long ( a few ps ) opo idler pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the idler pulses in this spectrum are dominated by a single spectral feature at @xmath15 @xmath12 , but there are several smaller intensity peaks at lower frequency which are also revealed in the second - order nonlinear processes discussed below . the resonant scattering spectrum from the two - mode microcavity studied in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2mode ] , when excited by the source of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sigidler](a ) , is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sigidler](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant enhancement of the mode features is evident in comparison to the non - resonantly scattered idler .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) spectrum of the opo laser beam , showing the femtosecond ( fs ) pulse at 6335 @xmath12 and the prominent picosecond ( ps ) pulse at the frequency of the idler . </S>",
    "<S> a number of smaller features are also visible near the main idler peak . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) resonant scattering spectrum from the microcavity studied in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : idler ] , using the source as in ( a ) , but slightly detuned . </S>",
    "<S> , width=188 ]    spectra given by the interaction of a non - resonant , narrow linewidth idler pulse ; a broad , resonant laser pulse ; and a two - mode ppc microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> the four second - order spectra ( red ) are plotted at half the measured energy . </S>",
    "<S> the signal pulse is tuned to higher energy for each spectrum s@xmath16-s@xmath17 , and so the idler tunes to lower energy . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the low energy region has been multiplied by 10 for clarity . </S>",
    "<S> the solid blue curve shows the laser spectrum scattered from a non - textured region of the sample , as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sigidler](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed blue curves schematically show the signal pulse spectrum tuning to higher energies.,width=340 ]    we now use this spectrum to explore the scheme shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tune ] . </S>",
    "<S> the off - resonant ps pulse from the idler plays the role of @xmath4 , while the two modes are associated with @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : idler ] shows a series of four second - order spectra from the microcavity supporting the quasi - localized modes discussed in fig .  [ fig:2mode](b ) irradiated by the two - color source . </S>",
    "<S> the opo is tuned to four different values of the center wavelength to acquire the spectra , which show three principal groups of features that are marked by lines a , b , and c to guide the eye . </S>",
    "<S> feature a and the broad background in group c ( the fit of which is plotted separately as a dashed blue line ) , are due to non - resonant second - harmonic generation of the ps and fs features , respectively , in the excitation spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> the three sharp features in group c that do not shift , and the two sharp features in group b that shift at half the rate of the excitation beam(s ) , are specific to the microcavity modes . </S>",
    "<S> they all arise from second - order processes involving the fields `` trapped '' in at least one of the modes . </S>",
    "<S> the three ( fixed ) peaks in group c correspond to the mode shg ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and sfg ( @xmath20 ) features , as in figure  [ fig:2mode ] . </S>",
    "<S> the features in group b are then easily understood to result from the second - order radiation from the two field distributions trapped in the microcavity modes respectively interacting with the ps pulses that irradiate the cavity during the ring - down to produce peaks at @xmath9 and @xmath10 . to understand the difference in the shift rate between features a and b , </S>",
    "<S> consider a ps pulse at @xmath21 interacting with a microcavity mode at @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> when the ps pulse is tuned from @xmath21 to @xmath23 , the second - order feature a shifts from 2@xmath21 to @xmath24 , which is a shift of @xmath25 , whereas feature b shifts from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , a shift of just @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime of each cavity mode is about 1 ps , and so the pulsed excitation probes the impulse response of the cavity ( i.e. there is minimal local field enhancement ) . the coupling efficiency into the cavity of the 60 @xmath13w average power resonant excitation beam is @xmath29  @xcite ; therefore , accounting for the 80 mhz repetition rate of the opo , approximately @xmath30 photons are resonantly coupled into the cavity with each pulse . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to consider what equivalent , critically - coupled cw - excitation or quasi - cw - excitation would create mode populations sufficient to yield an equivalent nonlinear response . in the cw limit , the local field intensity in the cavity is enhanced by a factor of @xmath1 . assuming the cw - beam is coupled into the cavity from a 600 nm @xmath14 200 nm single - mode ridge waveguide , the same nonlinear response could be achieved by a cw power of about 20 @xmath13w .    </S>",
    "<S> the processes illustrated here demonstrate that the fields stored in microcavity modes can be nonlinearly mixed with non - resonant signals to produce sum - frequency radiation . if the non - resonant fields were generated from light previously stored in a different microcavity , as in the schematic of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tune ] , this principle could be used to conditionally generate information at new frequencies which depend on the joint occupation state of two different microcavities . </S>"
