    "sweet parker ( sp ) models @xcite and the linear tearing instability of a current sheet ( cs ) @xcite based on the resistive magnetohyrodymanics ( mhd ) regime predict reconnection timescales which are too slow to explain bursty phenomena such as solar flares , magnetic substorms , and sawtooth crashes in tokamak @xcite .",

    "magnetohydrodynamics models of magnetic closed region show that the current sheet thickness decreases reaching ( potentially ) the sp thickness on alfvn time - scales @xcite but this process is probably stopped when the instability grows with the same time - scale .",
    "moreover from a conceptual point of view , an instability which grows faster as s increases , in the limit of @xmath17 brings to the paradox of a infinite reconnection rate in a ideal mhd plasma , incompatible with the `` frozen - in '' condition for magnetic field lines , that makes reconnection impossible ( see however @xcite for a discussion of the breakdown of the alfvn theorem in ideal plasma flows ) .",
