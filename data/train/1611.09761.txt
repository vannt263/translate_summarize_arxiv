    "protoplanetary disks in massive clusters can be rapidly dissipated . the main physical mechanism driving disk dispersal in these harsh environments is thought to be photoevaporation driven by uv photons from the massive stars in the clusters @xcite .",
    "uv photons from massive stars ionize and heat the gas in the disk surface and induce a gas flow away from the disk when the sound speed of the gas exceeds the escape velocity @xcite . direct evidence for this mechanism is provided by the large numbers of proplyds found near massive stars .",
    "the proplyds have cometary structures with tails pointing away from the nearby massive stars and are interpreted as the outer regions of disks of young stars that are being photoevaporated by extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation from the massive stars @xcite .    until now",

    "we have organized paper as follows : in @xmath22 we briefly introduce proplyd 133 - 353 , in @xmath23 we describe our observations , data reduction , and delineate our data analysis , in @xmath24 , we present our results and discussion , followed by a summary in @xmath25 .",

    "we obtained the near - infrared photometry of proplyd  133 - 353 from @xcite .",
    "the stellar luminosity of proplyd  133 - 353 was derived using dereddened @xmath25-band photometry , and the @xmath25-band bolometric correction ( @xmath26=2.12 ) for @xmath22=2450@xmath2350k calculated with the bt - settl models , assuming a distance of 414pc .",

    "proplyd  133 - 353 is above the youngest pms isochrone ( @xmath10.5myr ) from , and has a much cooler @xmath22 compared with other young stars , but shows a @xmath27 similar to a 0.05@xmath29brown dwarf at 1myr .",
    "recently , @xcite found the mean distance of the onc to be 388@xmath235pc . using this distance estimate , the @xmath27 of proplyd  133 - 353",
    "will be reduced by a factor of 1.14 , which moves the object down on the h - r diagram very slightly .",
    "therefore , the object is still very young ( age@xmath140.5myr ) even with this new distance estimate .    due to the lack of pms evolutionary tracks at ages younger than 0.5myr in , it is not possible to derive its mass and age directly through comparison to the pms evolutionary tracks . here , we tentatively constrain its mass using the 0.5myr isochrone from . on this isochrone ,",
    "the mass of an object with @xmath22=2450 is @xmath113  jupiter  mass ( @xmath30 ) , which is much lower than the known lowest mass ( 42@xmath30 ) for the objects at the centers of proplyds in onc in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , this mass might be an upper limit for proplyd  133 - 353 , since the @xmath22 values of young low - mass substellar objects seem to decrease during their evolution .",
    "the dividing line between a brown dwarf and a planet is around 13  @xmath30 , as defined by the deuterium fusion mass limit @xcite .",
    "therefore , proplyd  133 - 353 could be a planetary - mass object with an age younger than 0.5myr .",
    "we also use the pms evolutionary tracks from @xcite , which gives a mass @xmath125  @xmath30 and an age @xmath14000  yr .",
    "we note that evolutionary models at these young ages and very low masses have significant uncertainties @xcite , therefore in this work we do not attempt to conclusively determine the nature of the object .",
    "whether in the brown dwarf or planetary mass category , proplyd  133 - 353 is an interesting object for a detailed study .      as described in section .",
    "[ sect : proplyd ] , proplyd  133 - 353 has a tail pointing away from @xmath0oric , which indicates that its disk is being dissipated by the massive star .",
    "thus , proplyd 133 - 353 should be a member of the onc .",
    "here , we will discuss further evidence for the onc membership of proplyd  133 - 353 based on its x - ray properties and proper motion .",
    "proplyd  133 - 353 has been detected by the chandra space telescope in chandra orion ultradeep project @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrd ] ( right ) , we show its x - ray luminosity ( @xmath31 ) over 0.58.0 kev band vs. its stellar luminosity , and compare it with the values from other young stars in the onc with the @xmath31 from @xcite , and @xmath32 from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31/@xmath33 ratio of proplyd  133 - 353 is similar to those of other young stars with similar stellar luminosity .",
    "according to the pms evolutionary models , the expected @xmath27 for proplyd  133 - 353 at an age of 1myr is 0.00307@xmath28 , corresponding to its @xmath22 .",
    "if proplyd  133 - 353 is a foreground 1myr old planet , the expected distance could be @xmath1160pc , corresponding to the intrinsic luminosity and the observed brightness .",
    "if that is the case , we would expect that proplyd  133 - 353 shows a different proper motion from the ones of other young stars in the onc .",
    "we derive the proper motion from the hst archive images in f775w band observed at two epochs ( 2005  apr . vs. 2015  feb . ) ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : proper ] , we show the second - epoch hst image . the image has been calibrated in astrometry to the first - epoch image using the common onc members .",
    "we excluded proplyd  133 - 353 in the astrometric calibration ; therefore we can measure the proper motion of the proplyd relative to the onc . as a comparison , in fig .",
    "[ fig : proper ] we also show the positions of the stars in the first - epoch hst image . from the image pair",
    ", we obtain a relative proper motion for proplyd  133 - 353 , of @xmath34=4@xmath231  mas / yr , and @xmath35=@xmath43@xmath231  mas / yr . therefore , there is no significant proper motion of proplyd  133 - 353 relative to the onc .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that proplyd  133 - 353 and the onc have different motions in the line of sight , given the spectral resolution ( @xmath121100 ) of our mmirs data .    in conclusion",
    ", the arguments presented above , especially the cometary structure with a tail pointing away from @xmath0oric and the x - ray luminosity , strongly support that proplyd  133 - 353 is a member of the onc .      in the following",
    "we will compare the different scenarios for the origin and nature of proplyd  133 - 353 .",
    "theoretical calculations predict that mass loss rates from disks due to photoevaporation can be on the order of 10@xmath36@xmath29yr@xmath37  within a distance of 0.2pc from the ionizing massive star @xmath0oric @xcite , which is confirmed by spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "the photoevaporation process can effectively dissipate protoplanetary disks outside the gravitation radii ( @xmath38 ) , where the escape velocities equals the speed of sound , which is in turn determined by the uv heating @xcite . with such high mass loss rates",
    ", we would expect a very short disk lifetime for proplyd  133 - 353 , which is @xmath39yr with an assumption of a typical ratio ( @xmath1100 ) between stellar mass and disk mass .",
    "it is well known that there are many tiny dusty clouds , called `` globulettes , '' around hii regions .",
    "the mean mass of the globulettes is around several@xmath1310@xmath30 , and their mean radius is @xmath14000au @xcite .",
    "these globulettes are undergoing photoevaporation by uv photons from the massive stars in hii regions .",
    "however , the shocks generated by photoionization , as well as the surrounding warm gas , can also exert external pressure on the globulettes , and drive their collapse to form brown dwarfs and free - floating planets before they are eroded by photoevaporation @xcite .",
    "such a second - generation formation of brown dwarfs and free - floating planets has been confirmed by the discovery of dense cores in some of the globulettes .",
    "@xcite doubt the possibility that the external pressure in the form of radiation or ram pressure can drive globulettes to form brown dwarfs or free - floating planets , and instead they propose the collapse of the globulettes might be triggered by their collisions with the shells that borders the expanding hii regions . if proplyd  133 - 353 was formed in such a globulette near @xmath0oric due to either mechanism , we might explain both its younger age ( with respect to the one of the onc ) , and the lifetime of its disk , since its parental cloud can protect it from direct photoevaporation for a timescale of 10@xmath40@xmath41yr @xcite .",
    "finally , we explore an alternative scenario for the formation of proplyd  133 - 353 : instead of a photo - evaporating disk it may be an evaporating gaseous globule ( egg ) . in the vicinity of massive stars , a prestellar core can be eroded by the ionizing radiation from massive stars , and may form a free - floating brown dwarf or planetary - mass object .",
    "the final mass of the formed object can be approximated as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the isothermal sound speed in the neutral gas of the core , @xmath44 is the emission rate of lyman continuum photons , and @xmath45 is the number density of protons in the hii region around the core . in onc , we take @xmath46 @xcite , and @xmath47 around proplyd  133 - 353 .",
    "assuming @xmath48kms@xmath37  for a prestellar core with a gas temperature of 1535k , the expected final mass of the object formed in the core near proplyd  133 - 353 would be around 228@xmath30 , which is consistent with the mass ( 13@xmath30 ) of proplyd  133 - 353 .",
    "we have presented new near - infrared spectroscopy of proplyd 133 - 353 , a candidate photoevaporating disk given its cometary shape . the near - infrared spectroscopic data and and the location on the h - r diagram suggests that its central source is an m9.5-type substellar object with a mass ( @xmath49 13@xmath30 ) close to the planetary regime , and an age younger than 0.5myr .",
    "proplyd  133 - 353 has been detected by chandra , and presents a similar ratio of x - ray luminosity to stellar luminosity as other young stars in the onc with similar stellar luminosity .",
    "the comparison of two - epoch hst images suggests that proplyd  133 - 353 has a similar proper motion to the one of the onc .",
    "we explore two possibilities to explain the existence of proplyd  133 - 353 near @xmath0oric , and propose that proplyd  133 - 353 was formed in a very low - mass dusty cloud or an evaporating gaseous globule near @xmath0oric in a second - generation of star formation , which can explain both its young age and the estimated lifetime of its disk .",
    "the discovery of proplyd  133 - 353 may provide a clue to understanding the significant peak at 1020  @xmath30 of the onc initial mass function @xcite .",
    "the second - generation star formation in the very low - mass globulettes or in the evaporating gaseous globules could over - populate the objects of the onc within such a mass range .",
