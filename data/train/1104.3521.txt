    "quantum entanglement represents one of the corner stones of the quantum mechanics theory with no classical analog @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement is a nonlocal correlation between two ( or more ) quantum systems such that the description of their states has to be done with reference to each other even if they are spatially well separated . understanding and quantifying entanglement",
    "may provide an answer for many questions regarding the behavior of the many body quantum systems .",
    "particularly , entanglement is considered as the physical property responsible for the long - range quantum correlations accompanying a quantum phase transition in many - body systems at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "entanglement plays a crucial role in many fields of modern physics , particularly , quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "it is considered as the physical basis for manipulating linear superpositions of quantum states to implement the different proposed quantum computing algorithms .",
    "different physical systems have been proposed as promising candidates for the future quantum computing technology @xcite .",
    "it is a major task in each one of these considered systems to find a controllable mechanism to form and coherently manipulate the entanglement between a two - qubit system , creating an efficient quantum computing gate .",
    "the coherent manipulation of entangled states has been observed in different systems such as isolated trapped ions @xcite , superconducting junctions @xcite and coupled quantum dots where the coupling mechanism in the latter system is the heisenberg exchange interaction between electron spins @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting proposals for creating a controllable mechanisms in coupled quantum dot systems was introduced by d. loss et al . @xcite .",
    "the coupling mechanism is a time - dependent exchange interaction between the two valence spins on a doubled quantum dot system , which can be pulsed over definite intervals resulting a swap gate .",
    "this control can be achieved by raising and lowering the potential barrier between the two dots through controllable gate voltage . in a previous work ,",
    "a two - atom system with time dependent coupling was studied and the critical dependence of the entanglement and variance squeezing on the strength and frequency of the coupling was demonstrated @xcite .",
    "quantifying entanglement in the quantum states of multiparticle systems is in the focus of interest in the field of quantum information .",
    "however , quantum entanglement is very fragile due to the induced decoherence caused by the inevitable coupling to the environment .",
    "decoherence is considered as one of the main obstacles toward realizing an effective quantum computing system @xcite .",
    "the main effect of decoherence is to randomize the relative phases of the possible states of the considered system .",
    "quantum error correction @xcite and decoherence free subspace @xcite have been proposed to protect the quantum property during the computation process . nevertheless , offering a potentially ideal protection against environmentally induced decoherence",
    "is a difficult task .",
    "moreover , a spin - pair entanglement is a reasonable measure for decoherence between the considered two - spin system and its environment constituted by the rest of spins on the chain .",
    "the coupling between the system and its environment leads to decoherence in the system and sweeping out entanglement between the two spins .",
    "therefore , monitoring the entanglement dynamics in the considered system helps us to understand the behavior of the decoherence between the considered two spins and their environment .",
    "particularly , the effect of the environment size on the coherence of quantum states of the system can be considered by watching the spin pair entanglement evolution versus the the number of sites @xmath3 in the chain .",
    "developing new experimental techniques enabled the generation and control of multiparticle entanglement as well as the fabrication of one dimensional spin chains @xcite .",
    "this progress in the experimental arena sparked an intensive theoretical research over the multiparticle systems and particularly the one dimensional spin chains @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of entanglement in an @xmath4 and ising spin chains has been studied considering a constant nearest neighbor exchange interaction , in presence of a time varying magnetic field represented by a step , exponential and sinusoidal functions of time @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics of entanglement in a one dimensional ising spin chain at zero temperature was investigated numerically where the number of spins was seven at most @xcite .",
    "the generation and transportation of the entanglement through the chain , which irradiated by a weak resonant field under the effect of an external magnetic field were investigated .",
    "recently , the entanglement in anisotropic @xmath4 model with a small number of spins , with a time dependent nearest neighbor coupling at zero temperature was studied too @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent spin - spin coupling was represented by a dc part and a sinusoidal ac part .",
    "it was observed that there is an entanglement resonance through the chain whenever the ac coupling frequency is matching the zeeman splitting .",
    "very recently , we have studied the time evolution of entanglement in a one dimensional spin chain in presence of a time dependent magnetic field @xmath1 considering a time dependent coupling parameter @xmath0 where both @xmath1 and @xmath0 were assumed to be of a step function form @xcite . solving the problem",
    "exactly , we found that the system undergoes a nonergodic behavior . at zero temperature",
    "we found that the asymptotic value of the entanglement depends only on the ratio @xmath5 .",
    "however , at nonzero temperatures it depends on the individual values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "also we have demonstrated that the quantum effects dominate within certain regions of the temperature-@xmath8 space that vary significantly depending on the degree of the anisotropy of the system .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the time evolution of quantum entanglement in a one dimensional @xmath4 spin chain system coupled through nearest neighbor interaction under the effect of an external magnetic field at zero and finite temperature .",
    "we consider both time - dependent nearest neighbor heisenberg coupling @xmath0 between the spins on the chain and magnetic field @xmath1 , where the function forms are exponential , periodic and hyperbolic in time .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present our model and discuss the numerical solution for the the @xmath4 spin chain for a general form of the coupling and magnetic field . then , we present an exact solution for the system for the special case @xmath9 , where @xmath8 is a constant . in sec .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of entanglement for a one - dimensional spin chain with a nearest neighbor time - dependent heisenberg coupling @xmath0 between the spins in presence of a time - dependent external magnetic field @xmath1 at zero and finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we consider different forms of time dependence for the coupling and magnetic field ; exponential , hyperbolic and periodic . </S>",
    "<S> we examined the system size effect on the entanglement asymptotic value . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that for a small system size the entanglement starts to fluctuate within a short period of time after applying the time dependent coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the period of time increases as the system size increases and disappears completely as the size goes to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that when @xmath0 is periodic the entanglement shows a periodic behavior with the same period , which disappears upon applying periodic magnetic field with the same frequency . solving the particular case where j(t ) and h(t ) </S>",
    "<S> are proportional exactly , we showed that the asymptotic value of entanglement depends only on the initial conditions regardless of the form of @xmath0 and @xmath1 applied at @xmath2 . </S>"
