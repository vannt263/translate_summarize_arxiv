    "the rotation curves of spiral galaxies are typically flat out to about @xmath3 kpc .",
    "this implies that the mass enclosed increases linearly with radius , with a halo of dark matter extending beyond the luminous matter ( ashman 1992 ; freeman 1995 ; kochanek 1995 ) .",
    "the nature of the dark matter is unknown ( see e.g. primack , sadoulet & seckel 1988 ) , with possible candidates including massive astrophysical compact objects ( machos ) , such as brown dwarves , jupiters or black holes and elementary particles , known as weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , such as axions and neutrilinos .",
    "machos with mass in the range @xmath4 to @xmath5 can be detected via the temporary amplification of background stars which occurs , due to gravitational microlensing , when the macho passes close to the line of sight to a background star ( paczyski 1986 ) .",
    "since the early 1990s several collaborations have been monitoring millions of stars in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) , and a number of candidate microlensing events have been observed .",
    "the interpretation of these microlensing events is a matter of much debate . whilst the lenses responsible for these events could be located in the halo of our galaxy , it is possible that the contribution to the lensing rate due to other populations of objects has been underestimated ( for a discussion see e.g. bennett 1998 ; zhao 1999 ) .    in the case of the 2 events observed towards the smc",
    "there is significant evidence that , in both cases , the lenses are in fact located within the smc .",
    "the first of these events ( 97-smc-1 ) had a duration of around 217 days , which implies that if the lens is in the milky way halo then it probably has a mass in excess of @xmath6 ( palanque - delabrouille et .",
    "1997 ; alcock et.al . 1997b ; sahu & sahu 1999 ) .",
    "spectroscopy of the source does not show the contamination which would be expected if the lens was a star with such a high mass ( sahu & sahu 1999 ) .",
    "this leaves two possibilities : either the lens is a low mass star in the smc , or the lens is in the milky way halo but is non - stellar .",
    "the second event ( 98-smc-1 ) was a binary , which allowed the time taken for the lens to cross the source star , and hence the projected velocity of the lens , to be measured ( afonso et .",
    "al . 1998 ; alcock et . al . 1999 ) .",
    "the probability of a standard halo lens having a projected velocity as low as that measured ( @xmath7 km @xmath8 ) is of order @xmath9 ( alcock et .",
    "al . 1999 ) . due to tidal disruption , however , the smc is elongated along the line of sight , and hence its self - lensing rate can be high enough to account for both the observed events ( see gyuk , dalal , & griest ( 1999 ) and references therein ) .    of the 8 events observed towards the lmc by the macho collaboration during their first two years of observations , one event was a due to a binary lens with a very low lens projected velocity , @xmath10 km @xmath8 .",
    "alcock et .",
    "( 1996a ) argue that if the lmc self - lensing optical depth is large enough to be consistent with all 8 lenses being located in the lmc disk , then the probability of finding a projected velocity value this low is less than @xmath11% . therefore ,",
    "whilst this lens may itself be in the lmc disk it is unlikely that all 8 events are due to lenses in the lmc disk .",
    "if the source star is itself also a binary , however , then the low projected velocity is consistent with the lens being located in either the milky way halo or the lmc disk ( alcock et .",
    "it has also been argued that there is selection bias against the observation of halo binaries ( honma 1999 ) .",
    "these arguments do not , however , rule out self - lensing by other lmc populations",
    ". models of the lmc which have a self - lensing optical depth large enough to account for the observed events have been constructed ( aubourg et .",
    "al . 1999 ; salati et .",
    "al . 1999 ; evans & kerins 1999 ) .",
    "these models require the lmc lenses to be distributed in an extended , shroud or halo like distribution .",
    "it was previously though that , if the lenses are stellar , there were difficulties reconciling such an extended distribution with the low velocity dispersions observed ( see i.e gyuk et .",
    "al . 1999 ) .",
    "recent analysis of the radial velocities of carbon stars by graff et .",
    "al . ( 1999 ) , however , provides evidence for multiple stellar components .",
    "the lmc could also have a dark matter halo with the same macho mass fraction as the milky way , which would make a significant contribution to the microlensing optical depth ( kerins & evans 1998 ) .",
    "other possible locations for the lenses include a dark galaxy , or tidal debris , along the line of sight to the lmc ( zaritsky & lin 1997 ; zhao 1998 ; zaritsky et .",
    "al . 1999 ) , a warped and flared mw disk ( evans et .",
    "al . 1998 ) and an extended mw protodisk ( gyuk & gates 1999 ) .",
    "there are several long - term prospects for unambiguously determining the location of the lenses responsible for the lmc events .",
    "these include a more sensitive micro - lensing survey , covering the whole of the lmc , such as the proposed ` supermacho survey ' ( stubbs 1998 ) , parallax observations , by a satellite such as the space interformetry mission , ( boden , shao , & van buren 1998 ; gould & salim 1999 ) and microlensing searches towards m31 ( ansari et .",
    "1997 ; gyuk & crotts 1999 ) . in the meantime",
    "the location of the lenses is an open question . in this paper",
    "we will subsequently assume that the events observed towards the lmc are caused by machos located in the halo of our galaxy .    since the duration of a microlensing event depends on the position , transverse velocity and mass of the lens it is not possible to associate a unique macho mass with each event .",
    "however there are two techniques which can be used , assuming a specific halo model , to probe the mass function of the machos : maximum likelihood fitting of a parametrised mass function ( alcock et.al .",
    "1996b , 1997a ; mao & paczyski 1996 ) and the method of mass moments ( de rujula et .",
    "al . 1991 ; jetzer 1994 , mao & paczyski 1996 ) .",
    "mao and paczyski ( 1996 ) found that the maximum likelihood method , whilst slower than the mass moment method , is more robust .",
    "for the standard halo model , a cored isothermal sphere , the most likely macho mass function is sharply peaked around @xmath12 , with about half of the total mass of the halo in machos ( alcock et .",
    "this poses a problem for stellar macho candidates . in the case of white dwarves ,",
    "an unreasonably large fraction of the baryons in the universe would have had to have been cycled through the machos and their progenitors ( see freese , fields & graff 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "direct searches place tight limits on the halo fraction in faint stars ( charlot & silk 1995 ) , however recent calculations have found that old white dwarves with hydrogen dominated atmospheres may in fact be blue ( hansen 1999a , 1999b ) , rather than red as previously thought .",
    "the hubble deep field south contains a number ( @xmath13 ) of unresolved blue objects with high proper motions which may be old white dwarves ( ibata et .",
    "al 1999 ) .",
    "it is has also been argued however that these objects are more likely to be planetary nebulae ( johnson et .",
    "1999 ) and furthermore no similar objects have been found in ground  based proper motion studies ( flynn et .",
    "al . 1999 ) .",
    "these problems lead to the consideration of more exotic macho candidates such as primordial black holes ( pbhs ) ( carr 1994 ) .",
    "pbhs can be formed in the early universe , via a number of mechanisms , the simplest of which is the collapse of large density perturbations produced by inflation .",
    "in particular pbhs with mass @xmath14 could be formed due to a spike in the primordial density perturbation spectrum at this scale ( ivanov , naselsky & novikov 1994 ; yokoyama 1995 ; randall , soljaci & guth 1996 ; garca - bellido , linde & wands 1996 ) or at the qcd phase transition ( crawford & schramm 1982 ; jedamzik 1997 ; schwarz , schmid & widerin 1997 ; schmid , schwarz & widerin 1999 ; jedamzik & niemeyer 1999 ) where the reduced pressure forces allow pbhs to form more easily . in both cases",
    "it is not possible to produce an arbitrarily narrow pbh mass function ( niemeyer & jedamzik 1998 , 1999 ) and the predicted mass function is considerably wider ( green & liddle 1999 ) , than the sharply peaked mass functions which have been fitted to the observed events to date ( alcock 1997a ) .    given the difficulties with stellar macho candidates it is therefore important to investigate whether more exotic macho candidates , such as pbhs , are compatible with the microlensing events observed towards the lmc .",
    "in this paper we first compare the likelihood of the delta  function and power  law mass functions , previously fitted to the durations of the observed microlensing events , with that of the pbh mass function . as well as the standard halo model we use evans power ",
    "law halo models ( evans 1993 , 1994 ; alcock et .",
    "al . 1995 , 1996b ) and also investigate the effect of incorporating the transverse velocities of the source and observer ( griest 1991 ) .",
    "we then use monte carlo simulations to address the question of the number of events necessary to determine whether the macho mass function has significant finite width .",
    "in the early universe , where radiation dominates the equation of state , for a pbh to form a collapsing region must be overdense enough to overcome the pressure force resisting its collapse , as it falls within its schwarzschild radius . this occurs if the size of the perturbation , @xmath15 , is bigger than a critical size , @xmath16 , at the time at which it enters the horizon .",
    "there is also an upper limit of @xmath17 , since a perturbation which exceeded this value would form a separate closed universe ( harrison 1970 ) .",
    "early analytic calculations ( carr & hawking 1974 ) found @xmath18 with all pbhs having mass roughly equal to the mass within the horizon at that time , known as the horizon mass @xmath19 , independent of the size of the perturbation .",
    "recent studies ( niemeyer & jedamzik 1998 , 1999 ) of the evolution of density perturbations have found that the mass of the pbh formed in fact depends on the size of the perturbation : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath16 are constant for a given perturbation shape ( for mexican hat shaped fluctuations @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the energy density and @xmath27 is the hubble parameter . in order to determine the number of pbhs formed on a given scale , and hence the pbh mass function , we must smooth the density distribution using a window function , @xmath28 ( see e.g. green & liddle 1997 ) . for",
    "gaussian distributed fluctuations the probability distribution of the smoothed density field @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 } \\ ,       { \\rm d } \\delta(m_{{\\rm h } } ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the mass variance evaluated at horizon crossing defined as in liddle & lyth ( 1993 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the power spectrum .",
    "the formation of pbhs on a range of scales has recently been studied ( green & liddle 1999 ) , for both power - law power spectra and flat spectra with a spike on a given scale . in both cases it was found that , in the limit where the number of pbhs formed is small enough to satisfy the observational constraints on their abundance at evaporation and at the present day , it can be assumed that all the pbhs form at a single horizon mass .",
    "it is therefore possible to calculate the pbh mass distribution analytically : @xmath34 which using eqs .",

    "( [ opbh ] ) then leads to the constraint , @xmath50 . due to the exponential dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath47 ,",
    "if @xmath52 is reduced below 0.118 by more than a few per - cent , then the present day density of pbhs becomes negligible .",
    "the cobe normalisation gives a normalisation , on the present horizon scale , of @xmath53 .",
    "whilst constraints on the abundance of lighter mass pbhs , due to the consequences of their evaporation ( see e.g. carr 1996 ) , prevent @xmath47 from increasing rapidly as @xmath54 is decreased . therefore to produce a non - negligible density of pbhs with mass @xmath55 , whilst obeying the cobe normalisation and not over - producing lighter pbhs , the primordial density perturbation spectrum must have a spike , with finely tuned amplitude , located at this scale .",
    "there are several inflation models which may be capable of produce such a power spectrum ( ivanov et .",
    "al . 1994 ; yokoyama 1995 ; randall et .",
    "al . 1996 ; garca - bellido et .",
    "al . 1996 ) .",
    "the formation of pbhs at the qcd phase - transition was first suggested by crawford & schramm ( 1982 ) at a first  order phase transition the pressure response of the radiation to compression is reduced due to the co - existence , in pressure - equilibrium , of a high and a low energy phase .",
    "this leads to a reduction in @xmath16 and pbhs are formed more easily .",
    "the qcd phase - transition occurs at a temperature @xmath56 mev , when the horizon mass is @xmath57 , pbhs formed during the qcd phase - transition may therefore naturally have appropriate masses to be viable macho candidates .",
    "it is not clear from numerical investigations to date ( jedamzik & niemeyer 1999 ) if the pbh scaling law ( eq .",
    "( [ mbh ] ) ) holds in this case ; the pbhs formed are typically lighter than the horizon mass and the spread in the masses appears to be even larger than that found for those formed during radiation domination .",

    ".  [ secmfs ] above , are plotted , with the same , arbitrary , normalisation but different axes scales , in figs . 2 and 3 for the 6 event sub  sample and in fig . 4 for all 8 events and a standard halo .",
    "the parameters of the best fit mass functions are given in tables  [ dfmf ] to [ pbhmf ] .",
    "the results for the full 8 events and a standard halo are denoted by ` sh8 ' .",
    "given the small number of events , maximising the likelihood function depends mainly on reproducing the observed number of events ; for each mass function halo model combination the best fit to the six event halo sub sample has @xmath108 within 1% of 6.00 . for the standard halo ( both with and without the transverse velocity of the line of sight ) and power ",
    "law halo b the differential rate for a df mass function is comparable with the range of the observed timescales , and hence the df mass function produces the largest maximum likelihood . despite the large differences in the widths of the best fit mass functions , the differences between the resulting differential event rates in the region near their peaks , where the event rate is non  negligible , are very small , especially when the detection efficiency is included . this can be seen in fig .",
    "5 where we plot the differential event rate , with and without the detection efficiency , for the best fit df and pbh mass functions for the standard halo . in the case of power",
    " law halo c , the differential rate for the df mass function is narrower than the range of observed timescales so that broader mass functions are a better fit to the observed events .",
    "when the transverse velocity of the line of sight is included , for the standard halo , the df mass function still has the largest maximum likelihood , however the mean macho mass is increased by @xmath137 .",
    "we can also see that fixing the upper mass cut off , as in alcock et .",
    "al . ( 1997a ) , forces the power  law mass function to fall off more rapidly than if the upper cut off is allowed to vary .",
    "this is because there are effectively tight limits , due to the absence of long duration events , on the number of large mass ( @xmath138 ) machos . for the full set of 8 events , and a standard halo model ,",
    "the maximum likelihood is attained for mass functions with finite width .",
    "the df and pbh mass functions have roughly the same maximum likelihood , with that of each of the power law mass functions ( plf , plv , spl ) being roughly 3 - 4 @xmath139 greater .",
    "the differences in maximum likelihood between mass function / halo model combinations are small and , unsurprisingly given the small number of events , it is not possible to differentiate between mass functions using the current data , even if the halo model is fixed .",
    "in order to assess how many microlensing events will be necessary to determine whether the macho mass function has significant finite width , we carried out a number of monte carlo simulations assuming a ` broad ' macho mass function and , for different numbers of events , compared the fit to the data of ` broad ' and ` narrow ' mass functions . to minimise the considerable computing time required for these simulations we assume a standard halo and neglect the transverse velocity of the line of sight .",
    "the transverse velocity of the line of sight should of course be included in the analysis of a set of real microlensing events , as it leads to a shift in the parameters of the best fit mass function , however it s inclusion , and the precise form of the halo models chosen , should not change the general conclusions of this section . furthermore whilst the nature of the halo is not currently well - known leading , as we saw in sec .",
    "[ cur ] , to large uncertainties in the determination of the macho mass function presumably by the time a large ( 100 + event ) survey is completed our knowledge of the halo structure will have improved .",
    "we take our broad macho mass function to be the best - fit pbh mass function , with parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 as found by the maximum likelihood analysis of the current data and use the df mass function as a 2 parameter ` narrow ' mass function . whilst",
    "a power law mass function is perhaps a more realistic ` narrow ' macho mass function we prefer to compare fairly generic ` broad ' and ` narrow ' mass functions , with the same number of free parameters .",
    "we produced 400 simulations each for @xmath142 and 3162 events , for both a perfect detection efficiency ( @xmath143 for all @xmath75 ) and that of the first 2 years of the macho project , given by eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) . the actual efficiency of future long duration microlensing searches is likely to be somewhere between these two forms with the peak efficiency , and the duration at which it occurs , increasing with the search duration ( evans & kerins 1999 ) . for each simulation",
    "we find the best fit pbh and df mass functions by maximising the likelihood as defined in eq .",
    "( [ likedef ] ) .",
    "an alternative definition of the likelihood function ( markovic & sommer - larsen 1997 ) is @xmath144 where the differential event rate is normalised such that @xmath145 .",
    "this approach , however , neglects the information about the normalisation of the differential event rate which would be obtained in any real microlensing survey , since a particular number of events will be observed during a known exposure time .    for each simulation",
    "we compare the theoretical event rate distributions produced by the best fit mass functions with those ` observed ' using a modified form of the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "we can not use the standard ks test to compare the theoretical ( pbh and df ) event durations with our monte carlo ` data ' , since the parameters of the input mass functions have been estimated from the ` data ' .",
    "instead we use our simulations to compute the probability distribution of the ks statistic @xmath146 , the maximum distance between the theoretical cumulative distribution function and that of the ` data ' , for the best fit real pbh mass function .",
    "we then compare this distribution with the values of @xmath146 of the best fit ` false ' df mass functions .",
    "this gives us an indication of the number of events required to differentiate between mass functions .",
    "the fraction of the simulations passing the ks test at a given confidence level , for both the pbh and df macho mass functions , is shown in fig . 6 for each value of n for both forms of the efficiency .",
    "between 316 and 1000 events should be sufficient to discern whether the macho mass function has significant finite width .    in fig .",
    "7 we plot 1 and 2 @xmath47 contours ( which contain 68% and 95% of the simulations respectively ) of the parameters of the pbh mass function .",
    "the parameters of the input mass function are marked with a cross in fig .",
    "8 we plot contours of the parameters ( @xmath67 and @xmath119 ) of the best fit delta - function mass function and in fig .",
    "9 contours of the mean mass and halo fraction of the best fit pbh mass functions . fitting a df mass function",
    "when the true mass function is the pbh mass function leads to a systematic underestimation of the mean macho mass by @xmath147 .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the best fit values of @xmath19 and @xmath47 obtained are displayed in tables [ msdc ] and [ msdc2 ] , for the macho 2-year and flat efficiencies , respectively .",
    "we find , in agreement with mao & paczyski ( 1996 ) and markovic & sommer - larsen ( 1997 ) , that with @xmath148 events it will be possible to determine the parameters of the macho mass function to a few @xmath139 , if the halo structure is known .",
    "the macho mass ( @xmath0 ) and halo fraction ( @xmath149 ) favoured by current microlensing data pose severe problems for stellar macho candidate such as faint stars and white dwarves .",
    "it was previously thought ( yokoyama 1998 , green & liddle 1999 ) that the relatively broad mass function of primordial black holes was likely to be inconsistent with the durations of the observed microlensing events . in sec .",
    "[ cur ] we found that , using the current data , the likelihood of the best fit primordial black hole mass is comparable to that of the best fit delta - function , to @xmath150 .",
    "this then led us to investigate the number of events necessary to determine , assuming that the lenses are located in the milky way halo and that the halo can accurately be described by a known analytic form , whether the macho mass function has significant finite width .",
    "approximately 500 events should be sufficient to answer this question and also determine the parameters of the mass function to @xmath2 .",
    "if the halo model is not known then the number of events necessary is likely to be increased by a least an order of magnitude ( markovic & sommer - larsen 1997 ) .",
    "the use of a satellite , to make parallax measurements of microlensing events , would however allow simultaneous determination of the lens location and , if appropriate , mass function and parameters of the halo model , with of order 100s events ( markovic 1998 ) .",
    "if the machos are pbhs , then the gravitational waves emitted by pbh - pbh binaries will allow the macho mass distribution to be mapped by the laser interferometer space antenna ( nakamura et .",
