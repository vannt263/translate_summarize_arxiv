    "<S> we investigate the cosmological dynamics of a brane universe when quantum corrections from vacuum polarization are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> new vacuum de sitter points existing on randall - sundrum brane are described . </S>",
    "<S> we show also that quantum correction can destroy the dgp de sitter solution on induced gravity brane .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 electronic mail : lesha@sai.msu.ru + @xmath1 electronic mail : tpv@xray.sai.msu.ru + investigations of quantum effects in a strong gravitational field and their applications in cosmology have a long story . since the beginning of 70-th </S>",
    "<S> many interesting results modifying the standard friedmann cosmology due to vacuum polarization and particle production have been obtained . in particular , a vacuum de sitter solution and an inflationary regime driven solely by vacuum polarization without any matter @xcite </S>",
    "<S> was described even earlier than a common scalar field inflationary scenario . a detailed analysis of cosmology with vacuum polarization ( we will consider only this effect in the present paper ) have been done in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after some period of stagnation , this problem begins to attract a considerable attention last several years , mainly due to development of modified gravity models . </S>",
    "<S> the form of extra terms in cosmological equations of motion caused by vacuum polarization does not depend on a particular theory of gravity , however , peculiarities of a background metric in these theories could result in some new dynamical regimes . </S>",
    "<S> recently modifications caused by the vacuum polarization have been studied for regimes with soft future singularities . </S>",
    "<S> such regimes , being impossible in the standard cosmology , are rather typical in some modern cosmological scenarios ( see for example , @xcite ) , in particular , they are present in induced gravity brane models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum corrections change the dynamics significantly , leading to a softer singularity or even to non - singular solutions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting problem is stability of classical solutions with respect to quantum corrections . </S>",
    "<S> as quantum terms contain higher time derivatives in comparison with corresponding classical equation of motion , some classical solutions may become unstable . </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite this instability is described for certain regimes in induced gravity brane cosmology .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the vacuum polarization leads to the following vacuum expectation value for the energy density : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hubble parameter , @xmath4 depend upon the spin weight of the different fields contributing to the vacuum polarization .    if the classical friedmann equation has the form of _ algebraic _ dependence of the hubble parameter upon the energy density of the universe @xmath5 , substituting @xmath6 we get a _ differential _ equation which governs the cosmological evolution with quantum corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that @xmath7-term in @xmath8 can be incorporated into the function @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> only @xmath10-term containing time derivatives may provide instability . in the paper @xcite the case of @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> have been studied in braneworld models . </S>",
    "<S> it is a good assumption near a soft future singularity where @xmath12 while @xmath3 is finite , and @xmath10-term in ( 1 ) dominates . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we describe general features of brane dynamics with quantum corrections in their full form .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with modification of classical equations due to @xmath7-term . </S>",
    "<S> after that we consider the problem of stability . </S>",
    "<S> plots of the function @xmath9 ( which includes @xmath13 term ) presented below can be understood in two different ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , the curve @xmath9 can be considered as a track of cosmological evolution in some specific regime when @xmath10-term can be neglected . in this interpretation , @xmath14 is the sum of matter density @xmath15 and brane tension @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution runs from higher to lower energy ( from the right to the left in the plots ) till the point @xmath17 is reached . on the other hand , these plots can be interpreted as sets of de sitter fixed points ( with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) of a general dynamics with non - zero @xmath10 .    before we discuss branes it is useful to remember known results in the standard scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the modification of the standard friedmann cosmology caused by the @xmath7-term is shown in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the classical cosmology corresponds to the straight line @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath21 results only in changing this dependence to @xmath22 for large @xmath3 . a positive </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 modifies the situation significantly . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we can see a new vacuum de sitter point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this point is unstable if @xmath23 , on the other hand , the point @xmath24 , representing the late - time friedmann regime is stable for @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> it means that a trajectory starting in the vicinity of the vacuum de sitter point has inflationary behavior at the initial stage , then it leaves a neighborhood of de sitter due to instability . </S>",
    "<S> as a result , inflation ends , and finally the trajectory reaches the friedmann late - time attractor . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario of acceleration expansion with the natural exit without any kind of classical matter is called as `` starobinsky inflation '' @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> dependence in the standard cosmology without @xmath7 term of the quantum corrections ( solid ) , with negative @xmath7 ( dashed ) and with positive @xmath7 ( dot - dashed ) ]    we now turn to braneworld models . in order to understand how @xmath7-term modifies the randall - sundrum ( rs ) brane it is necessary to remember about two branches , arising from @xmath25 term in the equation of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the unmodified equation for the rs brane is @xmath26 here @xmath27 is a cosmological constant in the bulk , which should be negative in a realistic model , @xmath28 is the 5-dimensional planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> the equation ( 2 ) when solved with respect to @xmath14 has two solutions for a given @xmath3 , one with @xmath29-sign and the second with @xmath30-sign before the square root . </S>",
    "<S> this equation is represented as a shifted parabola on the plane @xmath31 . as the negative brane tension ultimately leads to instability , </S>",
    "<S> the second branch of the parabola ( which corresponds to negative @xmath14 ) is unphysical . </S>",
    "<S> positive @xmath7-term changes this classical picture in a way , very similar to the standard cosmology case ( see the dashed curve in fig.2 ) with the @xmath30 branch remaining the unphysical one . </S>",
    "<S> a vacuum de sitter point now corresponds to a positive root of the forth - order equation @xmath32 in the limit @xmath33 the value of hubble parameter in this point tends to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a vacuum solution in the rs brane theory with the quantum corrections was first noticed by nojiri and odintsov in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the picture for negative @xmath7 is shown in the dot - dashed curve in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath29 branch is similar to the standard cosmology , however , the @xmath30 branch is also shifted partly to a physical domain @xmath34 . in particular , it has a new vacuum de sitter point . </S>",
    "<S> the location the this point is also given by a positive root of ( 3 ) , however we will see below that stability properties of these two de sitter points are different .    </S>",
    "<S> -term ( solid ) , with negative @xmath7 ( dot - dashed ) and with positive @xmath7 ( dashed ) ]    finally , we consider induced gravity ( ig ) brane . </S>",
    "<S> the classical equation of motion is @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the 4-dimensional planck mass . as the equation of motion is quadratic with respect to @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> there are also two branches of solutions . </S>",
    "<S> it should be however noted that in some situations a negative brane tension on an ig brane does not ultimately lead to instability @xcite , so negative @xmath14 may have a physical sense in contrast to a rs brane . </S>",
    "<S> the plots in fig.3 have been done for the case of minkowski bulk ( @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath29 branch of the solid curve has a friedmann - like limit when the energy density of the brane vanishes ( @xmath38 if @xmath39 ) , the @xmath30 brane has a vacuum de sitter point , founded first by dvali , gabadadze and porrati in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . we will call it dgp point .    </S>",
    "<S> a negative @xmath7 ( the dot - dashed curve in fig.3 ) does not change the configurations of branches . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , positive @xmath7 can modify the picture seriously . </S>",
    "<S> large enough positive @xmath7 transforms the diagram so that the lower branch never enters into the @xmath34 half - plane , and the general picture resembles the case of rs brane ( compare the short - dashed curve in fig.3 with dashed curve in fig.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the dgp point is absent in this case . </S>",
    "<S> in can be easily calculated that this situation is realized if @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> nonzero @xmath27 in the bulk does not change this general picture qualitatively , though the expression for the critical @xmath7 becomes less simple . </S>",
    "<S> we can see also that the upper branch has a vacuum de sitter point for any positive @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> -term ( solid ) , with negative @xmath7 ( dot - dashed ) , with positive @xmath7 which allows the dgp point , denoted as @xmath41 ( long - dashed ) , and with positive @xmath7 which does not allow the dgp point ( short - dashed ) ]    as it was shown recently in @xcite , the effective phantom branch ( when @xmath42 is negative ) of ig brane is unstable with respect to @xmath10-term in the vacuum polarization . here </S>",
    "<S> we will show that this result is rather general and does not depend on a particular kind of a brane as well as on the value of @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a general situation when matter density in the corresponding effective friedmann equation is some algebraic ( may be multi - value ) function of the hubble parameter @xmath3 , so the evolution equation for a brane has the form : @xmath43 where the index @xmath44 marks different branches , @xmath16 is the brane tension . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that both rs and ig branes are particular cases of ( 5 ) .    in the de sitter point </S>",
    "<S> the matter density is diluted , so the equation becomes    @xmath45    now we add the quantum corrections ( 1 ) . the @xmath7-term can be incorporated into the algebraic functions @xmath46    the new de sitter point is given by    @xmath47    the resulting second order differential equation for @xmath3 can be written in the form of a system of two first order equations @xmath48 there is an equilibrium point of this system @xmath49 , which corresponds to the de sitter solution . in order to investigate stability of this equilibrium point we need a linearized system : @xmath50    the eigenvalues of this linearized system have the form : @xmath51.\\ ] ] we can easily see that the first eigenvalue is negative if and only if @xmath52 . the second eigenvalue is always negative ( because @xmath53 is negative in an expanding universe ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now evaluate @xmath54 : @xmath55+\\frac{1}{2hk_3 } \\frac{\\partial f_{i}}{\\partial h}.\\ ] ] in the desitter stable point @xmath56 , and we have finally @xmath57    as a result , if @xmath58 ( a normal branch ) , the de sitter solution is stable if @xmath23 ( as in the standard cosmology ) . in the opposite case ( a phantom branch ) </S>",
    "<S> we need @xmath59 for stability .    </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude , that if we have @xmath23 in our universe ( which is needed for stability of the minkowski space ) , all de sitter points on phantom branches are unstable .    note , that we did not specify any particular modified gravity theory , which may even be inspired by some scenario different from brane models . </S>",
    "<S> all we need is a function @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , this analysis can not be applied to a situation when equation which relates @xmath3 and @xmath14 is a differential one ( the most important example of this case is a scalar field with non - zero potential playing the role of matter ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it also should be noted , that , strictly spiking , we have proved the following statement : _ a de sitter point , being a future attractor of a universe is unstable with respect to vacuum polarization if it located on a phantom branch_. however , the results of @xcite indicate that an effective phantom regime is unreachable during a cosmological evolution of a ig brane when quantum corrections are taken into account , and it is quite reasonable to suggest that quantum corrections prevent a classical phantom regime from realization in a general situation . </S>",
    "<S> this problem requires further investigations .    in any cases </S>",
    "<S> , we have obtained new restrictions for possible explanations of a present phantom - like state of `` dark energy '' which is often claimed as being favorable by observations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several years ago it was remarked that a matter with a constant equation of state parameter @xmath60 causes an unwanted big rip future singularity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this singularity can be avoided in some scenarios with a phantom scalar field ( a scalar field with the wrong sign of the kinetic term ) @xcite , however , the fact that the energy of a phantom scalar field is unbounded below causes severe problem in quantum theory @xcite ( recently proposed more complicated models for a scalar field phantom see , for example , in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> all these problems are absent in modified gravity proposal . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> the matter in the universe remains standard ( and , so , there are no problems with matter instabilities ) , and the effective phantom behavior is achieved due to significant modification of the friedmann equation . the ig brane is a famous example of such kind of theory @xcite . our results , showing that quantum corrections have significant influence exactly on those branches of cosmological equations which simulates a phantom behavior , make clear that the modify gravity proposal is also not free from instability problems .    </S>",
    "<S> remembering shapes of @xmath9 dependence in braneworld models , we can see that the new branch of rs brane existing for @xmath21 is stable , as well as new vacuum de sitter point ( 3 ) on this branch . </S>",
    "<S> this point has no analog in standard cosmology and is similar to dgp point on ig brane . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> this point in the case of @xmath61 is unstable ( like in standard cosmology ) , giving a possibility of realization of starobinsky inflation on rs brane . </S>",
    "<S> we also can easily see that the starobinsky inflation on ig brane is always possible ( of course , if @xmath61 ) on the @xmath29 branch and for @xmath62 on the @xmath30 branch .    </S>",
    "<S> we have studied modifications of brane cosmology caused by vacuum polarization . </S>",
    "<S> this effect consists of two different terms in an effective energy density . </S>",
    "<S> the term proportional to @xmath63 alters possible fixed points of a cosmological dynamics , while the term containing time derivatives of @xmath3 may change stability properties of these fixed points . a general condition for the future fixed de sitter point to be stable </S>",
    "<S> have been derived . </S>",
    "<S> we should however note that all these results have been obtained when possible quantum corrections in the bulk are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is reasonable in studies of quiescent future singularities on a brane , because they are singularities of embedding @xcite , while the bulk remains regular ( and , so , far from a quantum regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> is quantum corrections in the bulk important for a brane dynamics in general situation remains unclear , we leave this problem for future investigations . </S>"
