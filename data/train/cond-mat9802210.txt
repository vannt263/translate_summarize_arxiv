    "the electronic ground state of a periodic solid , in the independent particle approximation , is naturally labelled according to the prescriptions of bloch s theorem : single - particle orbitals are assigned a quantum number * k * for the crystal momentum , together with a band index @xmath4 . although this choice is widely used in electronic structure calculations , alternative representations are available .",
    "the wannier representation@xcite , essentially a real - space picture of localized orbitals , assigns as quantum numbers the lattice vector * r * of the cell where the orbital is localized , together with the band index @xmath4 .",
    "wannier functions can be a powerful tool in the study of the electronic and dielectric properties of materials : they are the solid - state equivalent of `` localized molecular orbitals''@xcite , and thus provide an insightful picture of the nature of chemical bonding , otherwise missing from the bloch picture of extended orbitals .",
    "in addition , the modern theory of polarization@xcite directly relates the centers of the wannier functions to the macroscopic polarization of a crystalline insulator .",
    "wannier functions are strongly non - unique .",
    "this is a consequence of the phase indeterminacy @xmath5 that bloch orbitals @xmath6 have at every wavevector * k*. this indeterminacy is actually more general than just the phase factors : bloch orbitals belonging to a composite group of bands ( i.e. bands that are connected between themselves by degeneracies , but separated from others by energy gaps ) can undergo arbitrary unitary transformations @xmath7 between themselves at every * k*. we have recently developed a procedure@xcite that can iteratively refine these otherwise arbitrary degrees of freedom , so that they lead to wannier functions that are well defined and that are localized around their centers ( in particular , they minimize the second moment around the centers ) .",
    "such a procedure can be applied either to a whole band complex of bloch orbitals , or just to some isolated subgroups .    as a natural first application of this technique , we present here results for the case of batio@xmath0 in the cubic phase .",
    "perovskite ferroelectrics , of which batio@xmath0 is a paradigmatic example , owe their very rich phenomenology to the subtle competition of several degrees of freedom , balancing the long - range dipole - dipole interaction with short - range pauli repulsion .",
    "one of the striking features is the display of anomalously large born effective charges@xcite .",
    "their origin is understood in a simple tight - binding picture@xcite : the change in the bond length ( ti - o in this case ) corresponds to a dynamic charge transfer that is stronger when the bonding is borderline between ionic and covalent .",
    "localized wannier functions can thus be used to investigate the nature of this bonding , and to monitor the changes that follow a ferroelectric distortion .",
    "additionally , the displacement of each wannier center relates directly to the effective charge contribution of its orbital , and can be used to identify the nominal and the anomalous contributions to the polarization induced by an atomic displacement .",
    "electronic structure calculations are carried out using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is the most natural choice to study perfect crystals and to minimize finite size - effects in the study of several non - periodic systems ( e.g. surfaces , or impurities ) .",
    "the one - particle effective hamiltonian @xmath8 then commutes with the lattice - translation operator @xmath9 , allowing one to choose as common eigenstates the bloch orbitals @xmath10 , @xmath11\\;=\\;0   \\;\\;\\rightarrow\\;\\ ; \\psi_{n{\\bf k}}({\\bf r})\\ ; = \\;e^{i\\phi_n({\\bf k})}\\,u_{n{\\bf k}}({\\bf r})\\,e^{i{\\bf k\\cdot r}}\\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 has the periodicity of the hamiltonian .",
    "there is an arbitrary phase @xmath13 , periodic in reciprocal space , that is not assigned by the schrdinger equation and that we have written out explicitly .",
    "we obtain a ( non - unique ) wannier representation using any unitary transformation of the form @xmath14 @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the real - space primitive cell volume .",
    "it is easily shown that the @xmath17 form an orthonormal set , and that two wannier functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 transform into each other with a translation of a lattice vector @xmath19@xcite .",
    "the arbitrariness that is present in @xmath20 [ or @xmath13 ] propagates to the resulting wannier functions , making the wannier representation non - unique .",
    "since the electronic energy functional in an insulator is also invariant with respect to a unitary transformation of its @xmath4 occupied bloch orbitals , there is additional freedom associated with the choice of a full unitary matrix ( and not just a diagonal one ) transforming the orbitals between themselves at every wavevector * k*. thus , the most general operation that transforms the bloch orbitals into wannier functions is given by @xmath22 the wannier functions @xmath23 , for non - pathological choices of phases , are `` localized '' : for a @xmath24 far away from @xmath25 , @xmath26 is a combination of terms like @xmath27 , which are small due to the rapidly varying character of the exponential factor@xcite .",
    "several heuristic approaches have been developed that construct reasonable sets of wannier functions , reducing the arbitrariness in the @xmath28 with symmetry considerations and analiticity requirements@xcite , or explicitly employing projection techniques on the occupied subspace spanned by the bloch orbitals@xcite . at variance with those approaches ,",
    "we introduce a well - defined _ localization criterion _ , choosing the functional @xmath29 \\label{eq : omega}\\ ] ] as the measure of the spread of the wannier functions .",
    "the sum runs over the @xmath4 functions @xmath30 ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the expectation values @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "given a set of bloch orbitals @xmath35 , the goal is to find the choice of @xmath28 in ( [ eq : wannier ] ) that minimizes the values of the localization functional ( [ eq : omega ] ) .",
    "we are able to express the gradient @xmath36 of the localization functional with respect to an infinitesimal unitary rotation of our set of bloch orbitals @xmath37 where @xmath38 an infinitesimal antiunitary matrix @xmath39 such that @xmath40 this provides an equation of motion for the evolution of the @xmath28 , and of the @xmath17 derived in ( [ eq : wannier ] ) , towards the minimum of @xmath41 ; small finite steps in the direction opposite to the gradient decrease the value of @xmath41 , until a minimum is reached .",
    "there are several interesting consequences stemming from the choice of ( [ eq : omega ] ) as the localization functional , that we briefly summarize here . adding and subtracting the off - diagonal components @xmath42",
    ", we obtain the decomposition @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are respectively @xmath47\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath48 @xmath49 it can be shown that all terms are _ positive - definite _ ( in particular @xmath44 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; more importantly , @xmath44 is also _ gauge - invariant _",
    ", i.e. , it is invariant under any arbitrary unitary transformation ( [ eq : wannier ] ) of the bloch orbitals .",
    "the minimization procedure thus corresponds to the minimization of @xmath50 . at the minimum ,",
    "the elements @xmath51 are as small as possible , realizing the best compromise in the simultaneous diagonalization , within the space of the bloch bands considered , of the three position operators @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( which do not in general commute when projected within this space ) .      as shown by blount@xcite , matrix elements of the position operator between wannier functions take the form @xmath55 and @xmath56 these expressions provide the needed connection with our underlying bloch formalism , since they allow us to express the localization functional @xmath41 in terms of the matrix elements of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we thus determine the bloch orbitals @xmath59 on a regular mesh of * k*-points , and use finite differences to evaluate the above derivatives . for any given * k*-point in a regular cubic mesh ( sc , fcc ,",
    "bcc ) , we have a star * b * of @xmath60 * k*-points that are first - neighbors ; their weights in the evaluation of derivatives are @xmath61 .",
    "we define @xmath62 as the matrix elements between bloch orbitals at neighboring * k*-points .",
    "the @xmath63 are a central quantity in our formalism , since we can then express all the contributions to the localization functional using the connection made by blount , together with our finite - difference evaluations of the gradients .",
    "after some algebra we obtain@xcite @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 from these , we can calculate the change in the localization functional in response to an infinitesimal unitary transformation of the bloch orbitals , as a function of the @xmath63 ; once these steepest - descents are available , it is straightforward to construct a procedure that updates the @xmath28 towards the minimum of the functional .",
    "we study here the cubic phase of batio@xmath0 , using a plane - wave total - energy pseudopotential approach with the local - density approximation to the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we use norm - conserving pseudopotentials in the kleinman - bylander representation , with @xmath67 kinetic - energy tuning@xcite for the oxygen atom and a troullier - martins procedure@xcite for the titanium , to bring the cutoff convergence down to 900 ev .",
    "the @xmath68 and @xmath69 levels of titanium have been included in the valence .",
    "the brillouin zone is sampled with a @xmath70 monkhorst - pack mesh ; the lattice parameter used is 3.98 .",
    "5.5truein    5.5truein    the minimization of the total energy provides the kohn - sham bloch orbitals on a regular mesh of * k*-points , that are then used as a starting point for the construction of the wannier functions .",
    "the subsequent minimization of the localization functional determines the @xmath28 that correspond to the maximally - localized wannier functions . in batio@xmath0",
    "there are several groups of bands that are separated by gaps . in order of increasing energy , we have the band groups corresponding to the ti @xmath68 ( 1 ) , ti @xmath69 ( 3 ) , ba @xmath71 ( 1 ) , o @xmath72 ( 3 ) , ba @xmath73 ( 3 ) and o @xmath74 ( 9 ) levels ( in parenthesis are the number of bands in each group ) .",
    "we initially consider each group of bands separately , and perform the minimization on the 6 subspaces of dimensions @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the wannier functions determined from the the ti @xmath68 or the ti @xmath69 groups strongly resemble atomic orbitals , slightly deformed by the underlying crystal potential , and are not shown here .",
    "we show instead in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] one of the three oxygen - centered wannier functions that are derived from the oxygen @xmath72 bands . in each unit cell",
    "there are three such functions , sitting on each of the oxygens .",
    "the orbital shows its atomic @xmath1 character ; there are some contributions on the ti , with @xmath2 and/or @xmath3 character ( the titanium is slightly embedded in a @xmath78 orbital ) .",
    "interesting results emerge from the localization of the ba @xmath73 bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , center and right panels ) .",
    "these bands correspond to three orbitals in each unit cell , all centered on the barium and oriented along the three cristallographic directions ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "it can easily be seen ( center panel ) that , in addition to the distinctive atomic @xmath2 orbital on the barium , there are significant @xmath82-like contributions sitting on 8 of the 12 neighboring oxygens .",
    "this supports the suggestion that barium in this compound has some covalent character@xcite , and it is consistent with the anomalous effective - charge contributions that come from this group of wannier functions ( see next subsection ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we decide to treat the ba @xmath73 bands together with the o @xmath72 bands , we can ( obviously ) increase the degree of localization of each orbital . in this latter case",
    "( right panel ) the @xmath82 contributions on the oxygens decrease , being transferred to the @xmath72 orbitals localized on the oxygens themselves .    finally , we examine the 9 oxygen @xmath74 bands that result from the hybridization of the o @xmath74 electrons with the ba @xmath83 and the ti @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "there are three localized orbitals on each oxygen , oriented along the ti - o - ti bonds .",
    "we label two of these orbitals as @xmath86 and one as @xmath87 , according to their symmetry along the ti - o - ti axis .",
