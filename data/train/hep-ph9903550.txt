    "inflationary cosmology proposes a period of nearly exponential growth in the primordial universe and in so doing solves a number of the problems that face big bang models . in most implementations of inflation ,",
    "the post - inflationary universe is a very cold and very empty place , and the first question one has is , where did the all matter seen today came from ?",
    "the short answer is that it was due to a process called _ reheating _ in which the inflaton decayed and released its energy into `` normal '' matter and radiation .",
    "it was realised in 1990 , however , that the long answer , the details of reheating , might turn out to be very interesting indeed .",
    "traschen and brandenberger@xcite showed that if the inflaton field oscillates coherently at the end of inflation , then it may drive a period of explosive particle production through the mechanism of parametric resonance .",
    "this process is often termed _ preheating _ and its ramifications for cosmology include the areas of non - thermal phase transitions and defect production , baryogenesis , dark matter , gravitational waves and primordial black holes ( see @xcite and refs . within ) . in models which allow preheating , _ re_heating is now understood as preheating followed by thermalisation .    in the standard analysis of preheating one assumes a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe and then considers , both analytically@xcite and numerically@xcite , the field dynamics in this background . in general",
    "one finds that certain modes in the momentum space of the fields are exponentially populated , with the precise structure of these _ resonance bands _ being highly model - dependent .",
    "the result is that the fields soon deviate from homogeneity and there are significant non - linear effects such as rescattering of the particles , possible symmetry restoration and back reaction on the inflaton .",
    "although the flrw scale factor can be calculated self - consistently@xcite in these scenarios , it was realised recently that the impact of inhomogeneity@xcite and non - linearity@xcite on the metric must also be considered .",
    "our analysis of preheating is new in that we use the full einstein field equations .",
    "this enables us to study non - linear gravitational effects that are not accessible in the perturbative approximation .",
    "we find that parametric resonance can induce large metric inhomogeneities and that mode - mode coupling and back reaction is significant . at present",
    ", our principal simplifying assumption is that the inhomogeneity is in one spatial direction only .",
    "this means we have a @xmath1-dimensional system of partial differential equations for two metric functions .",
    "the larger goal we are pursuing is to determine the spectrum of amplified fluctuations , in both the fields and the metric , that arise from preheating . at issue",
    "is whether predictions of preheating are in accord with cosmological observations .",
    "recently it has been argued@xcite that super - hubble modes can be amplified during preheating .",
    "the rationale is that inflation leaves the oscillating inflaton coherent on scales much larger than hubble radius .",
    "if this is the case , one might have to reconsider the standard perturbative account of the fluctuations that lead to large - scale structure formation , especially if mode - mode coupling occurs . on the other hand , it is certainly the case that amplified fluctuations on hubble and sub - hubble scales will give rise to gravitational waves@xcite , and one would also like to know if primordial black hole formation after inflation is affected@xcite .",
    "here we briefly survey our progress to date .",
    "we have considered preheating in two models of chaotic inflation , supposing there are no fields other than the inflaton .",
    "we have confirmed@xcite an analytical result@xcite that the @xmath2 model does not undergo parametric resonance . in the @xmath3 model where the standard analysis predicts parametric resonance in the field",
    "we have found strong amplification of the corresponding metric modes , and coupling of these modes to modes outside the resonance band .",
    "the modes which are amplified are sub - hubble modes",
    ". we will report more fully on these results in a forthcoming paper@xcite .",
    "for simplicity we have assumed a universe with planar symmetry , so the metric functions depend only on time and one spatial co - ordinate .",
    "we studied preheating after @xmath2 inflation@xcite using the metric @xmath4 in the limit of small spatial inhomogeneity this resembles a flat flrw metric written in terms of physical time .",
    "we could also use this metric for the @xmath3 case , but it turns out to be more convenient to introduce a `` conformal - like '' metric .",
    "this is obtained via a co - ordinate transformation : @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which allows ( [ met1 ] ) to be written as @xmath7 here , we will concentrate on this second metric as we have discussed ( [ met1 ] ) elsewhere@xcite and the way we choose the initial conditions is the same in both cases .",
    "the einstein field equations , @xmath8 , give equations of motion , i.e. equations involving second derivatives in time , for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in addition one obtains two constraint equations which contain only first derivatives in time .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath11 follows from @xmath12 .",
    "( we refer the reader to @xcite for the explicit form of these rather lengthy equations . )",
    "we numerically integrate the equations of motion using the same techniques of @xcite and , in addition , simultaneously compute the co - ordinate transformation which takes us back to metric ( [ met1 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to determine @xmath13 and @xmath14 as well .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we are now extending the initial results mentioned above@xcite .",
    "first we will incorporate general initial conditions and then study more realistic models which include other fields beside the inflaton .",
    "once we have determined the spectrum of amplified fluctuations we will be able to consider whether or not cosmological observations can be used to rule out certain preheating models .",
    "we would like to thank robert brandenberger , fabio finelli , bruce bassett and david kaiser for useful discussions .",
    "computational work in support of this research was performed at the theoretical physics computational facility at brown university .",
