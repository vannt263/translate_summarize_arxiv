    "we discuss here an improved measurement of the width of the purely leptonic decay @xmath21 , when the @xmath5 is either a @xmath6 or a @xmath7 , when the latter decays into a @xmath22 @xcite . in a companion article",
    "@xcite we report an improved measurement of the decay width for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .    in the standard model ( sm )",
    "these decays are described by the annihilation of the initial quark - antiquark pair into a virtual @xmath23 that materializes as a @xmath24 pair ; the process is shown in fig .  [ dstomunu ] .",
    "the decay rate is given by @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath27 mass , @xmath28 is the mass of the charged final state lepton , @xmath29 is the fermi coupling constant , and @xmath30 is a cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element with a value we take equal to @xmath31 of 0.97418(26 ) @xcite , and @xmath2 is the  decay constant , \" a parameter related to the overlap of the heavy and light quark wave - functions at zero spatial separation .",
    "0.00 cm    = 3.0 in    the sm decay rate then is predicted using a theoretical calculation of the decay constant .",
    "two calculations have been carried out using unquenched lattice quantum - chromodynamics ( lqcd ) .",
    "_  find @xmath32 mev @xcite , while a more recent calculation of follana _ et al .",
    "_  gives @xmath33 mev @xcite .",
    "the latter calculation is more than three standard deviations lower than the average of previous cleo and belle measurements @xcite .",
    "dobrescu and kronfeld have proposed three models based on physics beyond the sm that are consistent with known data and could possibly explain the difference .",
    "one is a charged higgs model and the other two involve different manifestations of leptoquarks @xcite .",
    "the recent cleo measurement of @xmath34 mev , is consistent with both the aubin _",
    "et al . _  and follana _ et al .",
    "_  predictions , of @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 ) mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is particularly important to understand if the discrepancy in the @xmath37 case is due to physics beyond the sm , a faulty theoretical calculation , or to an unlikely measurement fluctuation .",
    "we note that precise information on the size of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements extracted from @xmath38 mixing measurements requires theoretical input on the  decay constants \" for @xmath39 and @xmath40 mesons or their ratio , @xmath41 @xcite . although the calculations in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 systems are not the same , many of the techniques used are common , and a discrepancy in the charm system at a minimum , does not give confidence in the theoretical predictions for the @xmath42 system . in this paper",
    "we present an updated measurement of @xmath2 with much improved precision .",
    "akeroyd predicts that the presence of a charged higgs boson would suppress @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "there is however the possibility , not considered by akeroyd , that it is the charm quark that is responsible for a np contribution not the @xmath45 quark @xcite . in that case",
    "the relative change would be similar in @xmath46 and @xmath27 decays .",
    "we can also measure the ratio of decay rates to different leptons , and the sm predictions then are fixed only by well - known masses . for example , for @xmath47 to @xmath48 :    @xmath49    using measured masses @xcite , this expression yields a value of 9.76 with a small error .",
    "any deviation in @xmath50 from the value predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tntomu ] ) would be a manifestation of physics beyond the sm .",
    "this could occur if any other charged intermediate boson existed that affected the decay rate differently than mass - squared .",
    "then the couplings would be different for muons and @xmath51 s .",
    "this would be a clear violation of lepton universality @xcite .",
    "most other measurements of @xmath2 have been hampered by a lack of statistical precision , and relatively large systematic errors @xcite .",
    "one large systematic error source has been the lack of knowledge of the absolute branching fraction of the normalization channel , usually @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the results we report here will not have this limitation , nor did our previous measurement @xcite , nor did the belle measurement @xcite .    in both @xmath48 and @xmath47 @xmath37",
    "decays the charged lepton must be produced with the wrong helicity because the @xmath37 is a spin-0 particle , and the final state consists of a naturally left - handed spin-1/2 neutrino and a naturally right - handed spin-1/2 anti - lepton . because the @xmath7 has a mass close to that of the @xmath27 , the helicity suppression is broken with respect to the @xmath6 decay , but there is an additional large phase space suppression . because of the helicity suppression in @xmath48 the radiative process @xmath53 may have a significant rate .",
    "dobrescu and kronfeld , however , estimate this process is only 1% of the lowest order mechanism , for photon momenta below 300 mev , which is relevant range for this analysis .",
    "we include this radiative correction in what follows @xcite .",
    "( there is no correction for the @xmath47 final state . )",
    "the data will also be corrected for final state radiation of the muon , as our monte carlo simulation incorporates this effect @xcite .",
    "the cleo - c detector @xcite is equipped to measure the momenta and directions of charged particles , identify them using specific ionization ( @xmath54 ) and cherenkov light ( rich ) @xcite , detect photons and determine their directions and energies .",
    "in this study we use 600 pb@xmath55 of data produced in @xmath56 collisions using the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) and recorded near a center - of - mass energy ( @xmath57 ) of 4.170 gev . at this energy",
    "the @xmath56 annihilation cross - section into @xmath58 + @xmath1 is approximately 1  nb , while the cross - section for @xmath59 is about a factor of 20 smaller . in addition , @xmath43 mesons are produced mostly as @xmath60 , with a cross - section of @xmath615  nb , and also in @xmath62 final states with a cross - section of @xmath612 nb .",
    "the @xmath63 cross - section is a relatively small @xmath610.2 nb @xcite .",
    "there also appears to be @xmath64 production .",
    "the underlying light quark ",
    "continuum \" background is about 12 nb .",
    "the relatively large cross - sections , relatively large branching fractions , and sufficient luminosities allow us to fully reconstruct one @xmath37 as a  tag , \" and examine the properties of the other . in this paper",
    "we designate the tag as a @xmath65 and examine the leptonic decays of the @xmath27 , though in reality we use both charges for tags and signals .",
    "track requirements , particle identification , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 selection criteria are the same as those described in ref .",
    "@xcite , except that we now require a minimum momentum of 700 mev / c for a track to be identified using the rich .",
    "we also use several resonances that decay via the strong interaction . here",
    "we select intervals in invariant mass within @xmath310 mev of the known mass for @xmath69 , @xmath320 mev of the known mass for @xmath70 , @xmath310 mev for @xmath71 , @xmath3100 mev for @xmath72 , and @xmath3150 mev for @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "we reconstruct tags from either directly produced @xmath37 mesons or those that result from the decay of a @xmath75 .",
    "the beam constrained mass , @xmath76 , is formed by using the beam energy to construct the @xmath37 candidate mass via the formula @xmath77 where @xmath78 runs over all the final state particles .",
    "if we ignore the photon from the @xmath79 decay , and reconstruct the @xmath76 distribution , we obtain the distribution from monte carlo simulation shown in fig .",
    "the narrow peak occurs when the reconstructed @xmath37 does not come from the @xmath75 decay , but is directly produced .     from monte carlo simulation of @xmath80 at an @xmath81 of 4170 mev .",
    "the narrow peak is from the @xmath27 and the wider one from @xmath82 .",
    "( the distributions are not centered at the @xmath27 or @xmath83 masses , because the reconstructed particles are assumed to have the energy of the beam.),width=279 ]    rather than selecting events based on only @xmath76 , we first select an interval that accepts most of the events , @xmath84 gev , and examine the invariant mass .",
    "distributions from data for the nine tag decay modes we use in this analysis are shown in fig .",
    "[ inv - mass ] .",
    "note that the resolution in invariant mass is excellent , and the backgrounds not abysmally large , at least in these modes . to determine the number of @xmath65 events we fit the invariant mass distributions to the sum of two gaussians centered at the @xmath65 mass , a function we refer to as  two - gaussian . \"",
    "the r.m.s . resolution ( @xmath85 ) is defined as @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the individual widths of each of the two gaussians and @xmath89 is the fractional area of the first gaussian .",
    "the number of tags in each mode is listed in table  [ tab : ntags ] .",
    "there are two changes in modes from our previous analysis @xcite ; instead of @xmath90 , we now use @xmath91 , and we have added the @xmath92 , @xmath70 mode ; the background here is somewhat reduced as we apply a cut on the helicity angle , @xmath93 of @xmath94 , since the @xmath95 is polarized as @xmath96 . (",
    "here @xmath93 is the angle of the @xmath97 in the @xmath95 rest frame with respect to the @xmath95 direction in the parent frame . )",
    "these changes results in an increase of 20% more tags at the expense of more background .",

    "the average of this new @xmath2 result with the cleo - c result based on the decay mode @xmath13 , @xmath113 , is ( @xmath114 ) mev ( see table  [ tab : fds ] ) .",
    "this rate differs by 2.3 standard deviations from the follana _",
    "et al._. prediction @xcite , and is close to , but does not saturate the khodjamirian bound .",
    "( averaging in the belle result for @xmath115 , which is also an absolute branching fraction measurement raises the difference to 2.6 standard deviations . )",
    "if the difference with follana _ et al . _  were to persist with the advent of more precise measurements it could be explained by a deficiency in the lattice calculation , or physics beyond the standard model .",
