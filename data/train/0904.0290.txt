    "entropy is a measure of the lack of information about a system @xcite .",

    "whereas for a maximally mixed state , it acquires its maximal value of @xmath11 , where @xmath6 is the dimension of the density matrix @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , it is well known by now that von neumann entropy , which is based on shannon entropy for an information system , is a unique measure that satisfies the four khinchin axioms @xcite .",
    "two of the axioms are convexity and additivity . relaxing the convexity requirement leads to renyi entropy defined by @xmath12 while relaxing the additivity condition gives tsallis entropy @xmath13 where @xmath14 is some adjustable parameter . in both cases ,",
    "one recovers von neumann entropy in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "these generalized entropies have found applications in a wide variety of situations : renyi entropy has been useful for the analysis of channel capacities renner , giovannetti , birula and tsallis entropies have been applied successfully to some physical situations like multiparticle processes in particle physics@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "some of the generalized quantum entropies were introduced , and nonnegativity , continuity and concavity were discussed .",
    "however , the additivity and subadditivity do not always hold for these entropies @xcite .",

    "moreover , since von neumann entropy vanishes for all pure states , wigner and yanase proposed an entropy which measures our knowledge of a difficult - to - measure observable with respect to a conserved quantity .",
