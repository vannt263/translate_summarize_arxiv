    "iii - nitrides are usually considered as wide - band gap materials that have applications in devices such as ultraviolet / blue / green light - emitting diodes and lasers @xcite .",
    "however , recent measurements suggest that the band gap of wurtzite ( wz ) inn is below 1.0 ev @xcite , much smaller than the 1.89 ev band gap @xcite widely accepted in the past to interpret experimental data @xcite and to fit empirical pseudopotentials for modeling inn and related alloy properties @xcite . if inn indeed has a less than 1.0 ev band gap , which is even smaller than that for inp ( 1.4 ev ) @xcite , then inn and its iii - nitride alloys could also be suitable for low band gap device applications such as future - generation solar cells because the nitride alloys can cover the whole solar spectrum range .",
    "the possible low band gap of inn also provides a challenge to understand the general chemical trends of semiconductor band gaps @xcite .",
    "conventional wisdom holds that for common - anion ( or cation ) iii - v semiconductors , the direct band gap at @xmath3 increases as the cation ( or anion ) atomic number decreases [ the band gap - common - anion ( or cation ) rule ] .",
    "this observation is strongly supported by experimental data @xcite shown in figure 1 .",
    "for example , the direct band gaps of the common - anion compounds inas , gaas , and alas increase from 0.42 to 1.52 to 3.13 ev .",
    "similarly , the direct band gaps of the common - cation zinc - blende ( zb ) compounds gasb , gaas , gap , and gan increase from 0.81 to 1.52 to 2.86 to 3.32 ev .",
    "this trend also would hold for common - cation inx ( x = n , p , as , sb ) compounds if @xmath4 ev , as previously reported @xcite .",
    "however , the rule will be broken if @xmath5 ev as reported in recent measurements @xcite .",
    ".lda calculated structural parameters of aln , gan , and inn .",
    "results are compared with available experimental data ( in parenthesis ) .",
    "@xmath6 is the calculated total energy difference between the zb and wz phases .",
    "positive number indicate the wz structure is more stable , in agreement with experiment . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the analysis above , we see that the breakdown of the common - cation rule for the band gap in in compounds is due to the small @xmath7 .",
    "we find that @xcite , the small @xmath7 for inn is due to the combined effects of ( i ) a large difference between the cation in @xmath8 and anion n @xmath9 orbital energies , ( ii ) a large repulsion between the n @xmath10 and the high - lying in @xmath11 orbitals , and ( iii ) a large in - n bond length ( relative to aln and gan ) .",
    "because a similar situation also exists in ii - vi semiconductors , one would expect that the breakdown of the common - cation rule should also apply to the ii - vi systems .",
    "indeed , experimental data @xcite show that the zno band gap of 3.4 ev is smaller than the zns band gap of 3.8 ev .",
    "our calculations also show that cdo and hgo would have band gaps that are about 0.5 ev smaller than the band gaps of cds and hgs , respectively , if they could all exist in the zb phase .          our calculation and analysis above show that the fundamental band gap of inn is indeed small , around 0.8 ev . to understand the origin of some of the experiments which show large band gap of inn @xcite",
    ", we have performed detailed study of the band structure of inn .",
    "experimentally , one often assumes that the band edge states near @xmath3 is parabolic and the dipole transition matrix element is nearly independent of * k * , therefore , the absorption coefficient squared @xmath12 is a linear function of the absorption energy @xmath13",
    ". the fundamental band gap , thus , can be obtained from the interception with the energy axis by drawing a straight line in the @xmath12 versus @xmath13 plot @xcite . to test the validity of this assumption ,",
    "we show in figure 2 the calculated band structure of wurtzite inn .",
    "figure 3 shows the calculated electron effective masses , and figure 4 shows our calculated absorption coefficients of inn . for comparison",
    ", we also calculate the band structure and absorption coefficients of gan .",
    "we find that the conduction band of inn is strongly non - parabolic ( fig.2 ) .",
    "this is confirmed from the calculated electron effective masses ( fig .",
    "3 ) , which increase significantly with the band edge energy or electron concentration . if the conduction band was parabolic the electron effective mass would be a constant . because of the large deviation from the parabolic band , the calculated @xmath12 is not a linear function of @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . therefore , if one use the linear extrapolation technique to determine the band gap , the derived apparent band gaps depend on where the straight lines are drawn . for example , as shown in fig . 4 for inn ,",
    "using large values of the absorption coefficient to draw the straight line , one can obtain an apparent band gap that is about 0.4 ev larger than the fundamental band gap .",
    "the dependence is relatively smaller for gan which has a larger effective mass than that of inn , thus a larger density of states near the cbm and a sharper increase of the absorption coefficient .",
    "we notice that the samples used to obtain the large inn band gaps @xcite often have poor sample quality and the band gaps are usually estimated from the absorption spectra with large absorption coefficients .",
    "we also notice that the inn samples that show large band gaps often have high oxygen concentration @xcite and are heavily n - type doped @xcite . besides the possible formation of inno alloys as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this observation suggests that the measured absorption edge can be shifted by the moss - burstein effect @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows our calculated absorption edge energy as a function of the carrier density .",
    "we see that the absorption edge increases with the carrier density from 0.8 ev for intrinsic inn to @xmath14 2.5 ev for sample with electron concentration of @xmath1410@xmath15 @xmath16 . these results are consistent with recent experimental observation @xcite .",
    "in the last few years several excellent review articles @xcite and books @xcite have been published to described the band structure parameters of inn and other iii - nitride .",
    "the recommended band structure parameters are based on a collections of available experimental data and theoretical calculations .",
    "the approach used in this study enabled us to analyze the degree of the systematic lda errors on the band structure parameters of the iii - nitrides .",
    "for example , we find that the lda not only underestimate the band gap , but it also slightly underestimated the crystal field splittings @xmath17 and the spin - orbit splittings @xmath18 at the top of the valence band , as well as the electron and light hole effective masses .",
    "details of the analysis will be published elsewhere .",
    "based on the lda error analysis and comparison with available experimental data we propose here the recommended band structure parameters for the iii - nitrides shown in table vii .",
    "we suggest that these parameters should be used in the future to fit empirical pseudopotentials to study the nitride systems .",
    "in summary , using an empirical lda - based band structure method with band gap correction we have systematically studied the chemical trends of the band gap variation in iii - v semiconductors .",
    "we find that inn has a band gap of @xmath19 ev , in good agreement with recent experimental measurements .",
    "we show that the previously accepted band gap - common - cation rule does not hold for ionic inn and the ii - vi oxides .",
    "we have also compiled the recommended band structure parameters for aln , gan , and inn .",
