    "inflation @xcite , an epoch of accelerated expansion in the earliest history of the universe , is believed to be able to solve many problems of standard big bang cosmology , such as homogeneity , isotropy and flatness of the universe we observe now . among them , one of the most important for current and future observations is the generation of density perturbations from quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field @xcite .",
    "once those perturbations develop , they become the seeds of the fluctuations in the otherwise homogeneous and isotropic cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and matter distribution in the subsequent evolution of the universe .    for inflationary models driven by a scalar field slowly rolling down the potential , the density perturbations produced during inflation are generally expected to be nearly scale invariant ; that is , the power spectrum of those primordial perturbations are predicted to be @xmath0 with @xmath1 , where the deviation from @xmath2 depends on the detailed dynamics of the inflaton . in this ` slow - roll ' approximation we have the spectral index @xmath3 as a function of the potential and its derivatives , or slow - roll parameters , which distinguish different inflationary models .",
    "they are required to be small in common to maintain the scale invariance , which is as stated above , the consequence of the inflaton field slowly rolling down the smooth potential .",
    "certainly , recent observations put strong bound on @xmath3 ; it must be close to 1 @xcite .",
    "however , the scale invariance of @xmath4 is not directly constrained by experiments but _ assumed_. the spectra we can observe are the cmb and matter power spectra , which are believed to have been generated from the common @xmath4 , multiplied by some transfer functions describing the complicated physics of the evolution .",
    "we believe the scale invariance since the observations on large scales , where the linearity preserves the basic properties of primordial fluctuations , fit fairly with @xmath4 with @xmath5 , not since we actually observe the very scale invariant @xmath4 directly , nor since it is the only theoretical possibility .",
    "as mentioned above , when the inflaton rolls down the smooth potential slowly , the power spectrum becomes very close to the flat one , with @xmath1 .",
    "but the slow - roll approximation does not encompass all the possibilities of inflation .",
    "for example , even the potential exhibits singular behaviours and the inflaton field does not slowly roll down the potential so that the standard slow - roll scheme is not applicable @xcite , still it is possible to keep inflation going on . in this case , generally we obtain a scale dependent primordial power spectrum @xmath4 @xcite , possibly leading to a detectable discrepancy between the standard cosmological model and observations such as the dearth of halo substructure @xcite and the suppression of the low multipoles in the cmb anisotropy @xcite .    as the origin of such singular behaviour",
    ", we can think of the general situation that inflaton field @xmath6 is coupled to other scalar fields . during inflation",
    ", those scalar fields may undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking , so that they acquire some nonzero vacuum expectation values .",
    "provided that the symmetry breaking is rapid , the coupled scalar fields would result in a non - smooth behaviour in the inflaton potential @xcite .",
    "for example , consider a simple toy model where the effective potential contains quadratic terms of scalar fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 as @xmath8 when @xmath7 acquires vacuum expectation value @xmath9 , we can see that around the moment of symmetry breaking the ` slope ' of the potential @xmath10 changes . for a more realistic example , we move to another simple model where the effective potential of two scalar fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 is given as @xcite @xmath11 now assume that by spontaneous symmetry breaking the field @xmath7 acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value @xmath12 when @xmath6 becomes greater than some critical value @xmath13 ; then the mass of @xmath6 is modified .",
    "then the corresponding potential is @xmath14 clearly we see that there is a downward behaviour at the moment of symmetry breaking ] the effective mass of the field @xmath7 is @xmath15 , so for @xmath16 , the minimum of @xmath7 changes from 0 to @xmath17 , consequently the mass of @xmath6 also changes and we obtain a very sharp , step - like downward feature (  waterfall \" ) , depending on the choice of the parameters . note that in the usual hybrid inflation models such a spontaneous symmetry breaking is used to finish the inflationary phase , but in the present work we are interested in the associated power spectrum provided that inflation is _ not suspended _ by the symmetry breaking and is still proceeding . ] .",
    "thus , it is meaningful and interesting to open the possibility of non - smooth , featured potential and to investigate the resulting power spectrum on both theoretical and observational grounds .",
    "here we consider some inflaton potentials with singular , non - smooth behaviours and calculate the fully analytic results for the primordial power spectrum @xmath4 of the curvature perturbations .",
    "using those @xmath4 , we present the subsequent cmb and matter power spectra relevant for observations , and discuss the viability of such featured potentials . the possibility of broken scale invariance has been studied several times numerically @xcite , but here we obtain fully analytic results for @xmath4 as far as we can .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "first , in section [ secgsr ] we review the generalised slow - roll formalism , which we will use in the following section [ secps ] to derive the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations for potentials with feature such as slope change and step . in section [ secobservation ]",
    "we describe the cmb and matter power spectra associated with @xmath4 of the previous section , and discuss the possibility of degeneracy surviving the current observational constraints . in section [ seccon ]",
    "we summarise the results and conclude . throughout the paper we set @xmath18 .",
    "when we deal with some inflaton potential which is not smooth , it is not guaranteed that the slow - roll parameters , @xmath19 are approximately constants . therefore , naively applying the standard slow - roll approximation , where it is additionally assumed that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are both slowly varying , does not work .",
    "instead we must use some other scheme which encompasses the cases where the standard slow - roll picture is not applicable to solve the situation analytically ; we adopt the general slow - roll picture . in this section ,",
    "we briefly review the green s function method @xcite and the general slow - roll approximation discussed in @xcite .",

    "if @xmath131 is large , that is , if the step appears quite lately , many of the relevant scales would have already crossed the horizon and there would be no prominent difference .",
    "conversely , when @xmath131 is small , i.e. , most of the observationally important scales have gone through the step , the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath4 would have been obviously imprinted on the spectra we see today when the step is sharp enough . in the upper row of figure",
    "[ step ] @xmath131 is fixed to be @xmath128 and the size of the step varies . in the cmb spectrum on the left side",
    "it is shown that on small @xmath132 the power is slightly greater , but on large @xmath132 it becomes smaller .",
    "the oscillatory feature is manifest in the matter power spectrum in the right panel of figure  [ step ] .",
    "the dependence of the cmb and matter power spectra on @xmath131 is depicted in the lower row of figure  [ step ] . as expected ,",
    "when @xmath131 is large , it is almost the same with the background @xmath125cdm cosmology .",
    "but if @xmath131 is small enough to affect the whole observable scales , the departure from the usual @xmath125cdm is very large .",
    "note that for the case of smoothed step , only the first few oscillations in the matter power spectrum survive and the rest quickly diminish , as shown in figure  [ stepgraph ] .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the distortions of the observable cmb and matter power spectra are dependant on both the magnitude and the position of the feature . of these",
    ", the magnitude of the feature is tightly constrained to be very small by cosmological observations on the cmb and galaxy distribution . if the size were to be large enough to have been imprinted on the observable spectra , we would already have noticed a large departure from scale invariance on various scales .",
    "for example , the fractional change in the inflaton potential amplitude of about @xmath133 for the smoothed hyperbolic tangent step , i.e. , @xmath134 , is known to cause sufficient sharp features in the cmb spectrum @xcite . yet",
    ", it seems more difficult to put strong constraints on the position of the feature .    in the light of this",
    ", it seems not impossible to mimic some cosmological model by introducing a feature to another one with different parameterscdm with a model without @xmath125 ( @xmath135 ) by relaxing the hypothesis that the fluctuation spectrum can be described by a single power law . ] .",
    "that is , provided that the size is small enough , we may have strong degeneracies between cosmological models depending on appropriate position of the feature .",
    "in particular , by the cmb spectrum alone , we are possibly led to determine the cosmological parameters incorrectly , since the oscillatory period in the cmb spectrum might overlap with that of the feature . in figure  [ steposc ] , we show the difference between the cmb spectrum of the background @xmath125cdm and those of the models with steps at various positions .",
    "we see that a step at some position slightly smaller than @xmath136 gives a similar oscillatory cycle .",
    "also , @xmath137 seems to enhance the first peak slightly , but lower the subsequent ones .",
    "for example , in figure  [ degeneracy1 ] , we show the cmb and matter power spectra of two different models .",
    "one model , with a scale invariant primordial spectrum , is provided by the background @xmath125cdm , while the other has a sharp downward step at @xmath138 with @xmath139 , where the cosmological parameters are set to @xmath140 and @xmath141 . in this case , the position and the height of the first peak are very similar for the two cmb spectra , making them not easily distinguishable . however , in the matter power spectra we can note an oscillation in the power in the small @xmath130 region , leaving some scope for discrimination .    another example is given in figure  [ degeneracy2 ] , where again the background @xmath125cdm is shown for comparison .",
    "here we take @xmath139 and @xmath142 , and the parameters @xmath143 and @xmath144 . while the cosmological parameters are quite different , the cmb peaks and troughs roughly overlap in this example .",
    "it seems that even if we could measure the cmb spectrum with very high accuracy by some experiments , e.g. , using the planned planck surveyor , we should be very cautious to abandon any featured primordial spectrum and choose the precisely flat , scale invariant one confidently .",
    "therefore it is very likely that with the cmb observation alone , where the usually assumed scale invariant @xmath4 of the standard @xmath125cdm and the scale dependent @xmath4 from the inflaton potential with a step generate very similar cmb power spectra despite the different cosmological parameters , we are led to confusion for the parameter estimation .",
    "such degeneracies would only be broken by combining some other observations , e.g. , a matter power spectrum , as shown in figure  [ degeneracy2 ] .",
    "but when the step is not infinitely sharp but mild , which is supposed to be a more realistic case , the oscillation quickly dies away , except a first couple of peaks , back to the background value .",
    "this should make discrimination difficult in the matter power spectrum observations as well .",
    "in many extensions of the standard model of particle physics , e.g. , supersymmetry and string theory , the existence of many scalar fields is predicted . during inflation",
    "which such theories would have described correctly , more than one scalar field may have been relevant . in this",
    "regards , it is meaningful to investigate the effect of inflaton potential with some feature which is produced generically by spontaneous symmetry breaking of another scalar field coupled to inflaton .",
    "the corresponding power spectrum of curvature perturbations @xmath4 generally deviates from the usually adopted flat , scale invariant one .    in this paper",
    ", we have considered the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations which arises from some potential with a feature due to spontaneous symmetry breaking of another scalar field coupled to inflaton field .",
    "on the basis of the general slow - roll approximation , we can proceed in a systematic and organised manner with the calculation of the curvature power spectrum @xmath4 , and indeed in section  [ secps ] we have obtained fully analytic results of @xmath4 in various situations .",
    "generally , such a feature leads to the breaking of scale invariance of @xmath4 , which is given as an oscillatory behaviour in @xmath4 on scales smaller than those associated with the position of the feature , accompanied with an overall modulation of the power when @xmath10 becomes flatter or steeper .",
    "given such a power spectrum , we also have obtained the associated cmb and matter power spectra which we can actually observe .",
    "when the magnitude of the feature is large and its position corresponds to large scale , both the oscillation and power modulation imprinted in @xmath4 are noticeable in the cmb and matter power spectra .",
    "one expectation we could draw from the above results is that it might be possible to mimic some cosmological model with a scale invariant primordial power spectrum @xmath4 with a scale dependent @xmath4 resulting from some featured inflaton potential in spite of different cosmological parameters such as @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "such a degeneracy is especially strong for the cmb power spectrum , since the oscillatory period of @xmath4 may overlap with that of the cmb peaks , depending on the magnitude and the position of the feature in @xmath10 . in this regard , we believe that close investigations of independent observations , e.g. , the matter power spectrum or supernovae , would remove our potential confusion as regards the cosmological parameter estimates .",
    "it might also provide interesting theoretical possibilities for the particle physics responsible for the generation of the feature in @xmath10 .",
    "tight observational bounds on the magnitude and the position of the feature would constrain the particle physics model behind the inflaton potential as well , shedding some light on our understanding of the universe .",
