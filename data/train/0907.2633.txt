    "enhancement of strange hadrons yield in high energy nuclear collisions relative to that in  collisions at the same energy has long been regarded as one of the signatures of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) production in these collisions @xcite .",
    "supposedly , it will be more efficient to create @xmath7 pair in the qgp than in hadronic matter . in experiments",
    ", substantial strangeness enhancement has been observed in au+au and cu+cu collisions in star , especially for multi - strange hyperons @xcite . according to canonical statistical model , strangeness enhancement in nuclear collisions",
    "can also be due to canonical suppression of strangeness production in  collisions @xcite .",
    "recently , star s @xmath5 meson data @xcite shows an above unity enhancement in heavy ion collisions at rhic , which seems favor the approach of a fully equilibrated core plus hadronic corona @xcite .",
    "the study of strangeness production in d+au collisions will connect a+a and data , thus leading to better understanding of strangeness enhancement in nuclear collisions .",
    "the cronin effect , which is the enhancement of hadron spectra at intermediate @xmath6  in p+a collisions with increasing nuclear size , was first seen in the nuclear modification factor in low energy p+a collisions @xcite . at rhic energy ,",
    "the nuclear modification factor in d+au collisions for pions and protons @xcite show that the cronin effect exists for both particle species .",
    "the conventional models of the cronin effect attribute the change of @xmath6  spectra in p+a to multiple parton scattering in the initial stage before hard parton scattering , which will broaden the outgoing parton / hadron @xmath6  distribution @xcite .",
    "recently , the coalescence / recombination model , which describes the hadronization of partons in deconfined matter and reproduces well many features of hadron spectra , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in au+au collisions at rhic , has been applied to d+au collisions to describe the hadron spectra and the cronin effect @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the recombination model predicts particle type ( baryon / meson ) dependence of the cronin effect , as the particle type dependence of @xmath9 or @xmath8 at intermediate @xmath6  in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "therefore , the measurements of the cronin effect for more particle species are helpful to understand the mechanism of the cronin effect .    in star ,",
    "strange hadrons are reconstructed with the topology of their weak decay channels , @xmath10 ( 69.2% branching ratio ) , @xmath11 ( 63.9% branching ratio ) and @xmath12 ( 99.9% branching ratio)@xcite .",
    "this analysis is based on about 32 million minimum bias d+au collision events from star s 2008 run . for the time being , only the most central events ( 0 - 20% ) are well defined ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 according to glaubler model ) . in this paper , we present the results for the most central 20% events only .",

    "the total feed - down contribution from @xmath2 s is on the order of 23% to the inclusive @xmath1 yield .",
    "the spectra can be well fitted with a levy function @xcite , as shown in fig .",
