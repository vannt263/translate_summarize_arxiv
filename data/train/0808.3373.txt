    "the quasiharmonic approximation ( qha ) @xcite is a computationally efficient method for evaluating thermal properties of materials within the density functional theory ( dft ) from low to temperatures above the debye temperature .",
    "it provides high quality high pressure - high temperature materials properties @xcite in a continuous pressure - temperature ( pt ) domain in which anharmonic effects are negligible.@xcite however , it has a not well recognized shortcoming : the non - hydrostatic nature of thermal stresses in non - isotropic structures . broadly speaking ,",
    "these calculations start by obtaining the static internal energy of fully relaxed dft structures at various pressures . after computations of the vibrational density of states , the thermal energy contribution to the helmholtz free energy is added .",
    "this latter contribution has anisotropic strain gradients and produces deviatoric stresses .",
    "this straightforward procedure should be referred to as the statically constrained ( sc ) qha .",
    "it has been used to compute the elastic constant tensor of isotropic @xcite and non - isotropic minerals @xcite at high pt as well , even though pressure conditions were not precisely hydrostatic in the latter calculations . in general , relaxation of deviatoric stresses , irrespective of their origin , is essential in both experiments@xcite and theory,@xcite for generating realistic and reproducible structural and elastic properties .    here",
    "we show how to correct the elastic constant tensor obtained using the sc - qha .",
    "we exemplify the procedure by correcting to first order the elastic constants of mgsio@xmath0-perovskite ( pv ) and mgsio@xmath0-post - perovskite ( ppv ) , the major phases of the earth s lower mantle , for which elasticity _ data _ are essential to interpret seismic information of this region.@xcite we show that this first order correction is quite satisfactory for obtaining the aggregated elastic averages of these minerals and their acoustic velocities in the pt range of the lower mantle .",
    "this article is organized as follow : we first discuss the equations used for numerically determining the elastic constant tensor within the sc - qha .",
    "we then describe the procedure for correcting it to first order for deviatoric thermal stresses .",
    "we then evaluate these corrections to the previously reported elastic constant tensors of pv@xcite and ppv.@xcite",
    "the present procedure builds on a related procedure to correct structural parameters and equations of state of non - isotropic solids at high pts.@xcite the method introduced in ref .",
    "can correct the sc crystal structure at @xmath1 to infinite order as long as the sc elastic constant tensor is simultaneously corrected .",
    "however , this is a very demanding computational procedure and , fortunately , unnecessary . a first order correction to the crystal structure using sc elastic constant , appears to be sufficient .",
    "this conclusion was reached after examining the crystal structure of one of the most studied materials at high pt : mgsio@xmath0-perovskite.@xcite this type of experimental data is quite limited and results on other materials with similarly complex crystal structures would be helpful strengthen this conclusion .    according to the ( sc )",

    "the first term , @xmath5 , is the volume dependent static energy obtained after full structural relaxation under isotropic pressure , and @xmath6 is the corresponding phonon spectrum .",

    "the two frequency dependent terms in eq .",
    "( [ fofvt ] ) , the zero - point energy and the thermal energy , contribute to @xmath10 but their strain gradients are intrinsically anisotropic .",
    "this effect was recently quantified@xcite by the computation of deviatoric thermal stresses , @xmath13 , defined as the difference between the stress tensor and the nominal pressure ( diagonal ) tensor . in voigt s notation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the heaviside step function , equal to 0 for @xmath16 strictly negative and 1 otherwise .",
    "deviatoric thermal stresses are caused by the vibrational ( zero - point and thermal ) energies and are shown to be important at high pressures and temperatures .",
    "the larger the temperature , the more visible these stresses are .",
    "we have previously shown that these deviatoric stresses can be relaxed to first order if one knows the elastic constant tensor , @xmath17 , calculated within the ( sc ) qha.@xcite the latter are obtained from the gibbs free energy , @xmath18 , @xmath19 by calculating the second derivative of @xmath18 with respect to the strains @xmath20 and @xmath21:@xcite @xmath22 the adiabatic elastic constants , which are the relevant ones for interpretation of seismic data , are then computed using appropriate thermodynamics relations.@xcite below all calculated elastic constants , bulk and shear moduli , and velocities are adiabatic .",
    "lattice parameters at high pressures and temperatures under hydrostatic conditions can then be corrected to first order by evaluating the strains , @xmath23 , involved in the relaxation of the deviatoric thermal stresses given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) : @xmath24 the cartesian components of the relaxed lattice vectors are then : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are respectively the matrices of lattice vectors ( @xmath27 ) and cartesian strains ( keeping up with voigt s notation ) .",
    "notice that increase in symmetry or symmetry break ( phase transformations ) may be induced by deviatoric thermal stresses in the presence of soft phonon , i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 do _ not _ necessarily have to the same space group .    in ref .",
    "we pointed that attainment of zero deviatoric thermal stresses within the qha should involve a _ self - consistent _ cycle with simultaneous recalculation of the elastic constant tensor under hydrostatic condition followed by new structural relaxation , and so on .",
    "however , such procedure is extremely computationally intensive given the need to recompute vibrational density of states on a pt grid every step of the cycle .",
    "we show next how to obtain the elastic constant tensor corrected to first order with knowledge of ( [ eq : deltaepsilon ] ) only .",

    "the pt dependent elastic constant tensors of pv and ppv determined using the ( sc ) qha have been reported respectively in ref .   and ref .  .",
    "these are the major phases of the earth s lower mantle and their elastic properties are central information for the interpretation of the seismic properties of this inaccessible region in terms of temperature , composition , and mineralogy .",

    "( [ equationcorrection ] ) . clearly , the correction for ppv is considerably larger than the one for pv .",
    "this is mostly due to @xmath59 that is larger in ppv than in pv ( see above ) .",
    "the correction for ppv is always negative , which has the effect of decreasing its elastic constants , while for pv , the correction can be negative ( mostly at low temperature ) or positive ( mostly at high temperature ) . in principle , there are no reasons for having deviations of systematic nature and they should vary depending on the crystalline structure .",
    "one observation that remains true for all crystalline structures , however , is that positive deviations in one direction are to be compensated by a negative deviation in another direction , as observed in both pv and ppv .",

    "in summary , we have introduced a scheme to correct high pt elastic constants obtained using the statically constrained quasiharmonic approximation for deviatoric thermal stresses that develop in calculations of anisotropic structures .",
