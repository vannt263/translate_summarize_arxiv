    "@xmath0-ray sources including @xmath160@xmath2 agn - most of which are blazars ( @xmath198@xmath2 * ? ? ?",
    "blazars therefore form a major population of the @xmath0-ray sky and are potential targets for understanding the physical processes responsible for production of high - energy emission .",
    "moreover , blazars also account for the majority of the high energy @xmath0-ray background above 100  gev @xcite .",
    "bl lacertae objects ( bl  lacs ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) are clubbed together and called blazars . in spite of the dissimilarity of their optical spectra ",
    "fsrqs show strong broad emission lines , while bl  lacs have only weak or no emission lines in their optical spectra ",
    "they share the same peculiar continuum properties ( strong variability and polarization properties ) .",
    "they are characterized by powerful non - thermal emission ranging from radio to the @xmath0-ray bands and exhibit strong variability , over a variety of time scales from minutes to months and often the radio components detected in vlbi observations exhibit superluminal motion .",
    "these properties are interpreted as resulting from the emission of high - energy particles accelerated within a relativistic jet aligned with the direction of sight .",
    "in many cases , the bulk of the observed flux emerges in @xmath0-ray photons in gev ( tev for some sources ) energy range populating a major fraction of the high - energy sky @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing and challenging quests of current astrophysics is to understand the physical conditions and processes responsible for the production of high - energy particles , and the emission of @xmath0-rays .",
    "detailed investigation of multi - wavelength flux and spectral variability of individual sources including cross - band ( radio , optical , x - ray , @xmath0-ray , and polarization ) , relative timing analyses of outbursts , and/or vlbi component ejection / kinematics suggest that @xmath0-rays are associated with the compact regions of relativistic jets energized by the central smbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", the close association of the @xmath0-ray flare with a continuous change of the optical polarization angle provides evidence for the presence of highly ordered magnetic fields in the regions of @xmath0-ray production @xcite .",
    "recent studies ( at least for some blazars ) suggest a significant correlation between the variations of @xmath0-ray flux and the direction of the jet outflow in the sub - parsec scale region @xcite , which implies that the observed inner jet morphology has a strong connection with the observed @xmath0-ray flares . however , the fine details of acceleration mechanisms and radiation processes are still missing .    blazars exhibit a characteristic bimodal spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . the sed low - energy peak ( from radio to optical / uv and x - rays for some sources ) is commonly interpreted as synchrotron emission from high - energy electrons , while no consensus on the origin of the high - energy peak ( from x - rays to @xmath0-rays ) has been reached . in the framework of leptonic models",
    ", this second peak corresponds to photons produced via inverse - compton scattering of soft seed photons by the same electrons , with these seed photons originating either from within the jet ( synchrotron self - compton , ssc ) or from regions external to the jet , such as the accretion disk , the dust torus or the broad emission line clouds ( external compton , ec ) . in hadronic models ,",
    "the high energy peak is due to photons produced in photo - hadron interactions or by proton or charged @xmath3/@xmath4 synchrotron emission and subsequent cascades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . concerning the high - energy emission ,",
    "leptonic models are more favored in the literature ; however , hadronic processes remain a viable option .",
    "no clear consensus has been achieved on the location of emission regions .",
    "the radio@xmath0-ray correlations @xcite suggests the latter leading the former , which puts the location of high - energy emission regions closer to the central black hole .",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray spectral breaks at a few gevs require the emitting region to be located within the blr if the photon - photon pair production scenarios are responsible for their origin @xcite . on the other hand , coincidence of @xmath0-ray flares with the appearance of new components from the base of the jet indicates distances longer than few parsecs @xcite .",
    "interaction of moving features with the stationary features can amplify the magnetic field and accelerate particles @xcite .",
    "coincidence of @xmath0-ray flares with the passage of moving components through stationary features in jets has been observed in several sources @xcite , which implies that @xmath0-ray flares are produced downstream of the core at a distance of more than a few parsecs .",
    "particle acceleration in relativistic jets is also an open question .",
    "relativistic shocks seem to be effective in low magnetization regimes ; however in the case of high magnetization , shocks are weak and poor accelerators .",
    "particle acceleration through second order stochastic processes is rather slow in highly magnetized flows ; but it is still a viable option @xcite . in highly magnetized environments , particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection is very likely to occur @xcite .",
    "most likely all of these processes are in action on different scales in jets .",
    "closer to the central engines , magnetic reconnection could inject energetic particles in compact regions to produce rapid @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "further downstream the jet in low magnetized environments , the observed @xmath0-ray variations could be a natural consequence of relativistic shocks .",
    "magnetoluminescence and/or electromagnetic detonation is lately proposed to explain the fastest observed tev flares .",
    "the basic idea is that the tightly wound magnetic field in the inner jet regions is subject to dynamical instability which could be responsible for the rapid @xmath0-ray variability . in other words ,",
