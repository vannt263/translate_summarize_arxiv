    "the spin hall effect ( she ) is a rich physical phenomenon which , since its prediction @xcite , has led to many interesting discoveries in the field of spintronics .",
    "realized in nonmagnetic systems , the she allows for an all - electrical manipulation of spin .",
    "the underlying interaction of the she is spin - orbit coupling with the observable consequence that a transverse spin current is generated if an electrical charge current is driven in the longitudinal direction .",
    "notably , this can happen due to impurity scattering @xcite , the _ extrinsic _ she , or due to band structure effects @xcite , the called _ intrinsic _ she .",
    "the latter case is usually directly related to either structure inversion or bulk inversion asymmetry of the underlying nanostructure , resulting in rashba or dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling , respectively .",
    "remarkably , by now , both cases have been experimentally observed : the _ extrinsic _ she in semiconductor heterostructures by optical @xcite and electronic @xcite measurement techniques and the _ intrinsic _ she in two - dimensional semiconductors @xcite as well as in hgte / cdte heterostructures by combining the she with the so - called quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) in a single device @xcite .",
    "the qshe is yet another type of spin hall effect that exists at the boundary of a two - dimensional topological insulator realized in hgte / cdte quantum wells ( qws ) @xcite .",
    "it refers to the existence of protected metallic edge states propagating in opposite directions and forming a single set of kramers partners at each edge @xcite . the topological phase transition behind this effect is related to an inversion of bands with opposite parities due to the strong spin - orbit interaction and it is well described by a massive dirac equation @xcite . the critical point is then reached when the mass of the dirac fermions goes to zero .",
    "directly at that point , the system behaves like a single valley dirac fermion ; this has been experimentally confirmed @xcite .",
    "recently , yokoyama and co - workers predicted a giant spin rotation at a junction between a normal metal and qshe system @xcite ; this is one of the main motivations of our work .",
    "here , we go substantially beyond this prediction in two different ways .",
    "first and most importantly , we discover a different type of interface she at junctions between hgte / cdte qws and metals ( for both the normal metal and the superconducting cases ) .",
    "second , we functionalize our findings to propose a device for all - electric spin injection into normal metal leads in the absence of ferromagnetic contacts .",
    "all our predictions apply to nanostructures in the ballistic transport regime .",
    "we show below that this type of she is intimately related to the coexistence of propagating and evanescent modes at the interface between a qshe system and a metal .",
    "mathematically , this comes from the fact that the underlying low - energy hamiltonian contains terms that are linear _ and _ quadratic in the electron wave vector .",
    "physically , this interplay can happen near a band - inversion crossing that in the case of hgte / cdte qws drives the topological phase transition @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this effect exists even in the total absence of structure and bulk inversion asymmetry within each subsystem . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first prediction of a she in a composite system that does not break these symmetries in either subsystem .",

    "iii , we investigate the spin- and angular - dependence of transmission as well as the andreev reflection probabilities and analyze their asymmetric behavior as an interfacial spin hall effect .",
    "we propose to measure this effect and functionalize it by an experimental realization described in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec . v. details of calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "this section is devoted to the theoretical framework of the junction between a hgte / cdte quantum well and a metal .",
    "we present the model hamiltonian for the hgte / cdte quantum well and describe the scattering matrix method which allows us to calculate to the scattering probabilities through the interface .",
    "the band structure of a hgte / cdte qw is derived from the eight - band kane model @xcite . near the topological phase transition",

    "the parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath19 depend on the geometry of the hgte / cdte qw .",
    "the sign of @xmath19 relative to @xmath21 distinguishes the trivial phase ( @xmath24 ) from the non - trivial phase ( @xmath25 , @xmath21 being negative ) .",
    "the eigenenergies of @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 refers to the conduction ( valence ) band .",

    "the interface is assumed to be perfect and located at @xmath32 .",
    "the model of this junction relies on a step - like variation of the bands , modeled by @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "we make the reasonable assumption to model the normal metal as a highly doped hgte / cdte qw ( similar to the treatment of the corresponding problem in graphene @xcite ) and the proximity - induced superconductivity with a step - like varying pair potential @xcite .",
    "we assume that the only boundary of the problem is the qw / metal interface .",
    "therefore , we analyze bulk state transport in the remainder of this paper .    the scattering states in the bulk of the hgte / cdte qw can be written for each block of the hamiltonian ( [ bhz ] ) separately .",
    "they are plane wave ( two - component ) spinor wave functions that depend on all the parameters of the hamiltonian , in particular on @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "since we assume translation invariance in the @xmath39 direction , the transverse wave vector @xmath38 is conserved . due to the block structure of the hamiltonian",
    ", we can analyze the spin-@xmath7 scattering problem separately from the spin-@xmath10 case .",
    "in the qw region ( @xmath34 ) , the spin - up quasiparticles are described by two - components spinors @xcite @xmath40 where the @xmath29 sign labels the conduction ( valence ) subband .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath41 yields two possible wave vectors , namely @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "we make the further assumptions that @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which are motivated by typical parameters for hgte / cdte qws . under this choice of parameters , we find that @xmath47 is real and @xmath48 is imaginary .",
    "this results in the coexistence of propagating and evanescent modes on both sides of the boundary , which gives rise to the interface she further discussed below . on the left - hand side , propagating electrons have a real wave vector @xmath49 , where @xmath0 is the angle of incidence and @xmath29 labels the incident ( reflected ) mode",
    ". meanwhile , evanescent electrons are described by a complex wave vector @xmath50 .    at the metal side of the interface ( @xmath36 ) ,",
    "the outgoing scattering states have a similar form as the ones for @xmath34 but the definitions of the wave vectors @xmath51 contain the parameter @xmath52 instead of @xmath53 ( see appendix 1 for more details ) . to obtain the scattering amplitudes for transmission through the junction ,",
    "we match the wave functions and their derivatives at @xmath32 .",
    "once this calculation has been done for the spin-@xmath7 block the corresponding spin-@xmath10 problem follows by trs .",

    "<S> we study the spin - dependent transmission through interfaces between a hgte / cdte quantum well ( qw ) and a metal for both the normal metal and the superconducting cases . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we discover a type of spin hall effect at these interfaces that happens to exist even in the absence of structure and bulk inversion asymmetry within each subsystem ( i.e. , the qw and the metal ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this is a pure boundary spin hall effect which can be directly related to the existence of exponentially localized edge states at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how this effect can be measured and functionalized for an all - electric spin injection into normal metal leads . </S>"
