    "the experimental exploration of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in many different systems such as alkali metal gases  @xcite , hydrogen  @xcite , meta - stable helium  @xcite , and molecules  @xcite has led to a surge of interest in manipulating ultracold atomic samples under very different circumstances .",
    "one of the initial motivations for such development was and is the prospect of creating a continuous and coherent atomic beam  @xcite , which is the atomic analogy of the optical laser beam  @xcite .    among the major challenges in achieving a continuous atom laser",
    "is how to overcome the difficulty due to the restrictive cooling conditions for continuously condensing the atomic gas .",
    "spatial separation of the evaporative cooling from the destructive laser cooling may play a role in alleviating these challenges  @xcite .",
    "recently , a continuous bec source was achieved by periodically replenishing a reservoir with condensates  @xcite . there , optical tweezers were used to transport sodium condensates from where they were created to the reservoir .",
    "such procedure allows one to continuously replenish the reservoir which contains on average more than @xmath2 atoms . bringing a new condensate to the reservoir",
    "each time implies the merging of condensates with different relative phases since each condensates is created with a different phase .",
    "the merging of two condensates with different phases poses a limitation on the coherence of the process .",
    "recently , interference effects in the merging of 30 uncorrelated bose - einstein condensates released from a one - dimensional optical lattice have been discussed in  @xcite , whereas coherent splitting of becs by deforming an optical single - well into a double - well potential for a trapped atom interferometer have been addressed in refs .",
    "very recently , schumm _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has demonstrated a coherent beam splitter on an atom chip by splitting the condensate in a double - well potential and merging it again .",
    "they have demonstrated phase preservation in this process , even in the case when the split becs are far enough apart to inhibit tunnel coupling .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the axial splitting of a very much elongated cigar - shape condensate into two condensates  @xcite and their subsequent merging along the axial direction .",
    "our analysis includes finite - temperature effects . in other words , phase fluctuations arising due to temperature",
    "are taken into account during the whole process : splitting and merging .",
    "we observe that as long as the process of splitting and merging is adiabatic enough , both the split and the merged condensates , even at relatively large temperatures , do survive the effects of these fluctuations .",
    "low - dimensional quantum gases exhibit very fascinating properties and have attracted a lot of interest , both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "it is known that low - dimensional [ one- ( 1d ) and two- ( 2d ) dimensional ] quantum gases differ qualitatively from their 3d counterparts  @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , the use of a mean - field theory to describe a low - dimensional quantum gas is severely restricted . a widely used criterion to apply a mean - field approach is to demand that the average distance between particles , d , is clearly smaller than the correlation length of the condensate @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denote the mass , the interaction coupling , and the density , respectively . in three dimensions",
    ", the above condition leads to @xmath7 and is well satisfied for small densities , and the description of the system at @xmath8 with a mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation is fully satisfactory . in the one - dimensional case",
    ", however , this ratio behaves as @xmath9 and this fact changes drastically the range of applicability of a mean - field treatment . a careful analysis of the validity of a mean - field treatment in the 1d case  @xcite leads to the following condition : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of condensed atoms , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the axial and radial oscillator lengths , respectively , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the angular frequencies in the corresponding directions .",
    "thus , in 1d , contrary to the 3d case , when the density decreases the gas gradually becomes strongly correlated , acquires a fermionic character , and enters into the so - called tonks - girardeau regime  @xcite .",
    "experimental demonstration of a tonks gas has been recently achieved  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of generating low - dimensional bosonic gases raises the question of the effects of quantum fluctuations . in an untrapped 1d bose system",
    "these fluctuations destroy finite- as well as zero - temperature condensation .",
    "for trapped bose gases , the situation is quite different : for noninteracting bosons in such a trap the finite spacing between the lowest and the next energy level allows for the occurrence of 1d bose - einstein condensation even at finite - temperatures as stipulated in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in such a case the absence of gapless excitations indicates that the bec will not be destroyed immediately as interactions between bosons are turned on .    in 1d trapping geometries ,",
    "long - wavelength density and phase fluctuations lead to a new intermediate state between a condensate and a noncondensed system , which is commonly referred to as a _ quasicondensate_. in quasicondensates , the phase of the condensate is only coherent over a finite distance that is smaller than the system size . in other words , the phase coherence length is smaller than the axial size of the sample . to understand the nature of quasicondensates at finite - temperature",
    ", one has to analyze the behavior of the single particle correlation function by calculating the fluctuations of phase and density as has been done by petrov _",
    "et al . _",
    "there it is shown that for temperatures below the degeneracy temperature , the condensate s phase indeed fluctuates , but fluctuations of the density are still highly suppressed .",
    "this character of thermal fluctuations is also present in highly elongated 3d gases  @xcite , and has been recently observed experimentally in  @xcite .",
    "quasi 1d geometries can be accessible in magnetic traps with a cylindrically symmetric harmonic potential along the axial direction that have transverse frequencies @xmath16 much larger than the axial one @xmath14 .",
    "in such configurations the resulting condensate looks like a cigar aligned along the symmetry or z axis . with current technology , condensates with aspect ratio @xmath17 as large as 1000 are achievable .    in this paper",
    ", we study the process of splitting and subsequent merging of an elongated condensate confined in a 1d geometry both at @xmath8 , i.e. , when the condensate has a well - defined phase , and at finite - temperature ( @xmath18 ) , in the quasicondensate regime . for finite @xmath19",
    ", we analyze the process of splitting and merging for a wide range of temperatures , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 being the chemical potential ) corresponds to the characteristic temperature above which a true - condensate turns into a quasicondensate in which phase fluctuations begin to play a role . on the other hand @xmath23 is the 1d degeneracy temperature  @xcite .",
    "the transition , or crossover , between the different regimes for the 1d degenerate interacting bosonic gas , i.e. , true - condensate , quasi - condensate , and tonks gas is smooth .",
    "thus , in the regime of quasi - condensation density fluctuations are relatively suppressed while phase fluctuations are enhanced .",
    "by keeping all parameters fixed and reducing the number of atoms , phase fluctuations become more and more pronounced , mean - field theory fails , and the gas enters into the strongly correlated regime or tonks gas  @xcite .    in our case , the splitting of the condensate is achieved by means of a double - well potential grown adiabatically on top of a trapping harmonic potential . by adiabatically switching off the double - well potential ,",
    "we merge these condensates into a single one ( merged bec ) .",
    "we would like to stress that we use the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation  ( gpe ) throughout this paper .",
    "it is worth pointing out that although the gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite describes properly coherent evolution of the atomic mean - field at @xmath8 , it can also be used to solve time evolution at finite - temperature in a relatively straightforward manner .",
    "it might look like that the mean - field method of the gpe allows to make statements only about first order coherence .",
    "but , as it is well known , a closely inspection reveals that the gpe contains as such classical bogoliubov - de gennes  ( bdg ) equations , i.e. equations describing small fluctuations around a given solution of the gpe .",
    "since we are here interested in the study of relatively high temperatures @xmath24 , classical description of fluctuations is fully appropriate .",
    "it turns out that one can simulate temperature effects by adding fluctuations to the ground state solution of the gpe at @xmath8 in a way which mimics thermal fluctuations . at low temperatures @xmath25 , where @xmath26  @xcite , this can be generally done by identifying phonon ( quasi - particle ) modes , i.e. eigensolutions of the bdg equations .",
    "the fluctuations are expressed thus as sums over the quasi - particles with amplitudes taken from monte carlo sampling and corresponding to the thermal ( boltzmann ) populations of the quasi - particle modes .",
    "such a method is used in this paper , with the additional simplification that for quasi-1d situations only the phase fluctuations are relevant .",
    "note , that once we add the fluctuations initially at @xmath27 , and as long as they remain small in the course of evolution , they will propagate in time with a very good approximation as appropriate solutions of the time dependent bdg equations .",
    "note also , that our approach allows in principle to obtain information about all correlation functions : either in the form of an average over monte carlo realizations of the initial fluctuations , or in the form of time averages , due to the ( expected ) ergodic character of the evolution . in some cases ,",
    "even averaging over the initial data is not necessary : the results for different realizations are so similar that looking for few single cases allows one to draw conclusions about `` coherence '' . by coherence",
    "we mean here , that the splitting process of an initial 1d bec into two spatially separated 1d becs occurs with a well - defined relative phase between them .",
    "their subsequent merging into a single merged bec , when the process is fully coherent , should result in a single condensate with a well - defined relative phase with respect to the initial one .",
    "if this is the case , there is a perfect overlap between the densities of the initial and merged condensates .",
    "it is worth stressing that our approach is a simplified version of the classical field methods used by several groups  @xcite . in their approach",
    "some emphasis was put on the explanation of the temperature concept , and a certain model of finite - temperature effects has been studied .",
    "particularly interesting is here the possibility of extracting higher order correlations from a single shot measurements  @xcite , which in our case corresponds to a single realizations of the initial fluctuations .",
    "here we consider @xmath28rb condensate with @xmath29 atoms confined in an harmonic trap with frequencies @xmath30 hz and @xmath31 hz . for such parameters , the system is in the 1d thomas - fermi regime ( @xmath32 ) along the axial direction .",
    "the 1d chemical potential is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the effective 1d coupling strength  @xcite .",
    "for our parameters , transverse excitations are suppressed ( @xmath35 ) , and the dynamics of such a bose gas can be described by the usual mean - field gpe in 1d @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mean - field order parameter , or in other words the condensate wave function .",
    "the potential term @xmath38 includes both the magnetic trap and the double - well potential as described below : @xmath39        the potential used to split the condensate into two spatially separated condensates , @xmath40 is switched on and off adiabatically by means of a time - dependent function @xmath41 the maximum depth of this potential is @xmath42 in terms of the recoil energy @xmath43 and @xmath44 to achieve spatial separation of the split condensates one has to require that the distance between the two wells is , at least , of the order of the thomas - fermi radius ( @xmath45 ) this radius is given by @xmath46 so that @xmath47 for @xmath48 atoms , the thomas - fermi radius is @xmath49 m .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental results in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the time dependent function @xmath50 controls the switching on and off of the double - well potential and hence the overall splitting and merging process of the condensates .",
    "we define this function as @xmath51 in this equation  ( [ tevo - tmer ] ) , @xmath52 is the time duration required for evolving the 1d bec in real time before the splitting process begins .",
    "it extends for 10ms .",
    "just immediately after , the splitting process begins and continues for a time interval @xmath53 . at the end of @xmath53 , the function @xmath50 attains a maximum value of unity and remains constant for a time interval @xmath54 . during this time interval ,",
    "two spatially separated 1d becs are created . at the beginning of the time span @xmath55 , merging of the condensates starts by switching off the double - well potential .",
    "this process continues until the two 1d becs merge together .",
    "a complete merging is only possible when @xmath50 becomes finally zero , i.e. , when the optical potential is completely switched off . in this case",
    "the atoms remain only under the influence of the trapping potential .    to ensure coherence during the process of the switching on and off of the optical potential , the raising of the double - well has to be slow enough to avoid excitations and to allow for quantum tunneling between the two wells .",
    "notice that the relevant time scale of excitations is given by the inverse of the frequency of the trap , in our case @xmath56 ms .",
    "if @xmath57 we expect coherent splitting and merging . on the other hand , for @xmath58 of the order of @xmath59 or less , the process creates more and more excitations that cause incoherence .",
    "the faster the double - well potential switches on and off the stronger the excitations are . to check our claims",
    "we have carried out further numerical simulations for several values of @xmath53 and @xmath55 around @xmath59 . in general , we have observed that a coherent process , at @xmath8 , is achieved for switching times of 400 ms ( or larger ) .",

    "we calculate first the ground state of the system by evolving the gpe  ( [ 1d - gpe - t0 ] ) with @xmath65 in imaginary time .",
    "after the ground state has been found , we numerically solve eq .",

    "there we display the condensates density at three different times .",
    "first at @xmath66 the initial condensate ( initial 1d bec ) has a characteristic thomas - fermi profile with @xmath67 m .",
    "then at @xmath68 ms ( corresponding to the ramping up of the double - well potential in 400 ms and keeping it constant during additional 400 ms ) , two spatially well separated identical condensates ( split becs ) appeared , centered at @xmath69 , each of them with a number of atoms @xmath70 . finally , we display the density of the condensate at @xmath71 ms .",
    "the merged condensate ( merged 1d bec ) has exactly the same profile as the initial one ( initial 1d bec ) and thus they can not be distinguished in the figure , asserting that the process of splitting and merging is fully coherent .    .",
    "after coherently splitting an initial 1d condensate ( initial bec ) into two spatially separated ones ( split becs ) , by adiabatically switching on the double - well potential given in fig .",
    "[ pot ] , centered at @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the optical potential is again switched off adiabatically .",
    "this leads to a coherent merging of the split condensates into a single one ( merged 1d bec ) . the merged 1d bec overlaps on top of the initial 1d bec which is an indication of a completely coherent merging process . ]",
    "coherence may be a prerequisite for further applications such as in atom interferometry and quantum - information processing  @xcite .    before we proceed to the case of finite - temperature",
    ", it may be relevant to address the case of a nonadiabatic splitting and merging process , i.e. , when the double - well potential switches on and off too fast .",
    "we have carried out simulations for switching times as short as 20 ms . in such cases",
    "the splitting of the condensate ( even at @xmath8 ) becomes completely incoherent , there is no trace of phase preservation , and the condensate is destroyed , as is shown in fig .",

    "fluctuations of phase and density of a bec are the result of thermal excitations , and appear usually at finite - temperature  @xcite . in such a case",

    "[ phas ] . even though we present here results calculated for a fixed number of condensate atoms ( @xmath11 ) , it is numerically verifiable that the magnitude of the phase fluctuations is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of atoms and hence to the peak density of the condensate as described by eq .",

    "we have analyzed the case of zero temperature as well as finite - temperature in the so - called quasi - condensate regime , where the phase coherence length is smaller than the size of the system . at zero temperature and for a process adiabatic enough where the splitting and merging times are much larger than the characteristic time of the system given by the inverse of the trap frequency @xmath109 , a coherent splitting followed by a coherent merging is achieved and there is a constant relative phase between the initial and the final merged condensates . on the contrary",

    ", the system acquires large density and phase fluctuations on a length scale comparable with the coherence length @xmath110 , and a description based on the gpe becomes invalid . in the case of finite - temperature",
    "our results show that even in the presence of strong phase fluctuations , if the process of splitting and merging is carried out fully adiabatically , the condensate preserves the thomas - fermi density profile and there is phase coherence length preservation . in such cases ,",
    "the merged condensate is a quasi - condensate with the same initial density profile as the initial condensate and with the same phase coherence length , although the `` overall '' phase of the quasi - condensate is not preserved .",
    "this situation occurs even at temperatures very near the critical value for condensation as long as the trapping potential remains in place .",
    "our results may have a useful implication for manipulating 1d becs at zero as well as finite - temperatures such as in atom lasers , interferometry , and solitons .",
