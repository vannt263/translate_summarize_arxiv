    "fractional kinetics is finding increasingly wide application to physics , chemistry , biology and interdisciplinary complexity science@xcite .",
    "one reason for this is the link between  strange \" kinetics and observed non - brownian anomalous diffusion , motivating the use of fractional dynamical models of transport processes , including those based on fractional calculus .",
    "@xcite give numerous applications ; we will just note space plasmas @xcite , magnetically confined laboratory plasmas @xcite , fluid turbulence @xcite and the travels of dollar bills @xcite .    equally widespread in its application , and evolving in parallel with the theory of anomalous diffusion , is the theory of anomalous time series .",
    "the corresponding models , particularly in the mathematics and statistics literature , have often been based on stable self - similar processes @xcite .",
    "stability here means the property whereby the shape of a probability density function ( pdf ) remains unchanged under convolution to within a rescaling ( c.f .",
    "chapter 4 of @xcite ) it is an attractive feature in modelling , particularly when one anticipates that a signal represents a sum of random processes .",
    "in particular stable self - similar processes , a development in the wider field of stochastic processes@xcite , can model two effects which are are often seen in real data records .",
    "the first - mandelbrot s  noah \" effect @xcite- describes non - gaussian  heavy - tailed \" pdfs , while the second - his  joseph \" effect @xcite - manifests itself as long - ranged temporal memory .",
    "the many applications have included hydrology @xcite , finance @xcite , magnetospheric activity as measured by the auroral indices @xcite , in - situ solar wind quantities @xcite , and solar flares @xcite .",
    "the existence of two rich , parallel , but intersecting literatures means that it is not yet completely known which techniques from one will apply to a given problem in the other .",
    "it is for example not always clear _ a priori _ what type of kinetic equations will apply in a given context . the right class of kinetic equation for reversible microphysical transport need not also be the right one for an evolving time series taken from a macroscopic variable .",
    "the problem of model choice is an important and timely one , both in physics and more general complexity research . because different models can predict subtly different observable scaling behaviours , distinguishing them may require measuring several exponents , as any individual exponent may be identical across several models , a point recently emphasised by @xcite .",
    "it is now increasingly recognised that much natural data is of the type that @xcite dubbed  ambivalent \" . in such systems heavy tailed jumps and long - ranged temporal memory compete to determine whether transport is effectively superdiffusive or subdiffusive .",
    "the ambivalent process they used for illustration , and fitted to data , was the well - studied fully fractional continuous time random walk @xcite which incorporates both effects via fractional orders of the spatial and temporal derivatives in its kinetic equation .",
    "@xcite also advocated use of the same process in space physics for modelling the auroral index time series .",
    "they explicitly contested @xcite the applicability of a time series model @xcite based on a self - similar stable process - linear fractional stable motion ( lfsm ) @xcite - in this role .",
    "we note that , rather than being purely a mathematical abstraction , lfsm has been linked to physics via the propagation of activity fronts in extremal models @xcite .",
    "a comparison of these two approaches , leading to a better understanding of their structure and their similarities and differences , thus seems to us to be highly topical .",
    "it will be the first of two main topics of this paper .",
    "although we are fully aware that the kinetic equation we obtain on its own can not fully specify a non - markovian process , and , importantly , will not be unique to lfsm , we nonetheless believe that our comparison of the kinetic equations for the two paradigms is of value , particularly as a source of physical insight ( see also sections 1 and 2 of @xcite ) .    to make the comparison we first briefly recap ( table 1 ) the main kinetic equations corresponding to the modelling of time series by stable processes , and of anomalous diffusion by the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) , respectively",
    ". in particular we highlight ( following @xcite ) the difference between fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) and the fractional time process ( ftp ) which has sometimes led to confusion , at least in the physics and complexity literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we illustrate the potential value of this comparison with reference to a surprising gap in the physics literature , the absence of a kinetic equation corresponding to lfsm , analogous to the one given for fbm by @xcite . we give a simple derivation by direct differentiation using the characteristic function .",
    "the kinetic equation can be obtained by methods as diverse as a transformation @xmath1 of the time variable in the space fractional diffusion equation , and a path integral @xcite .",
    "our second main topic is the potential relevance of lfsm to physics as a toy model for  calibrating \" diagnostics of intermittency ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . as a frequent attribute of nonequilibrium and nonlinear systems",
    ", intermittency has been a particular stimulus to physicists and time series modellers @xcite .",
    "in particular the paradigm of self - organised criticality ( soc ) @xcite has been one framework for this , embodying the hypothesis of avalanches of activity in nonequilibrium complex systems .",
    "we investigate the scaling of intermittent bursts in lfsm , using the burst size and duration measures which have very often been used as direct diagnostics of soc .",
    "such measures have been previously studied on , among many others , magnetospheric and solar wind time series @xcite .",
    "we follow several earlier conjectures @xcite and make simple scaling arguments building on a result of @xcite which suggest that lfsm could indeed be one candidate model for observed power laws in such bursts .",
    "we test our arguments with numerics using the algorithm of stoev and taqqu @xcite .",
    "we confirm the earlier numerical results of @xcite and the more recent work of @xcite .",
    "these papers considered just the @xmath2 , fbm case , using a running average threshold and a fixed threshold respectively .",
    "however we find numerically that for lfsm our simple scaling argument , while giving a good approximation to the dependence of the burst size exponent on the self similarity exponent @xmath3 as @xmath0 is progressively reduced from 2 , becomes much less accurate as @xmath0 reaches 1 .",
    "we conclude by offering some suggestions as to the reasons for this , and describing future work .",
    "@xmath4    in table 1 we collect the kinetic equations for the pdf @xmath5 of some processes which have been proposed in the various literatures on time series analysis and anomalous diffusion .",
    "for clarity we concentrate on the simplest examples from the family of stable processes and from the ctrw . in the table",
    "the ( statistical ) self similarity exponent @xmath3 is defined using dilation in time where @xmath6 goes to @xmath7 : @xmath8 and the equality is in distributions .",
    "the fourth row of table 1 corresponds to bachelier - wiener brownian motion ( bwbm ) and the fifth row to the familiar diffusion equation where we have abbreviated @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "bwbm is of course a manifestation of the central limit theorem ( clt ) @xcite .",
    "the solution @xmath11 is of gaussian form with width spreading as @xmath12 and its characteristic function is also a gaussian in k @xmath13 with stability exponent @xmath2 ; the process has power spectrum @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , the fifth row corresponds to relaxing the assumption of finite variance , by allowing a stability exponent @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding probability density functions ( pdf ) @xmath16 are the @xmath0-stable class , with power law tails decaying as @xmath17 .",
    "following mandelbrot we refer to these as  lvy flights \" or ordinary lvy motion ( olm ) .",
    "the corresponding kinetic equation @xmath18 has a symmetric reisz fractional derivative in space , @xmath19 , which in the table is given as three dimensional and abbreviated to @xmath20 .",
    "the reisz derivative is a pseudodifferential operator with symbol @xmath21 and @xmath22 has characteristic function @xmath23 . unlike the cases we now go on to discuss , the kinetic equation for olm",
    "is still unambiguously markovian and an expression of the extended clt . due to infinite divisibility , in this specific case",
    "the pdf alone @xmath22 is enough to uniquely characterise the stochastic process , which we will call @xmath24 .",
    "the seventh row of table 1 describes the case when the iid assumption is relaxed , rather than the finite variance one .",
    "this case is more subtle than the previous two .",
    "relaxing independence is one way to break the iid assumption and is the situation we consider .",
    "it can be done in several ways , we will discuss just two .",
    "one of the ways which has been employed in the ctrw formalism is to take a power law pdf of waiting times @xmath25@xcite .",
    "this became known as the fractional time process ( ftp , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the waiting times themselves are still iid , but their infinite mean is assumed to be a consequence of dependence due to microscale physics . the kinetic equation that corresponds to the ftp @xcite can be seen in the fourth column of the eighth row in table 1 .",
    "we may define a temporal exponent by @xmath26 .",
    "the fractional derivative in time , of order @xmath27 , corresponds physically to the power law in waiting times .",
    "the prime indicates that this exponent is not identical to the memory parameter @xmath28 in the case of fbm or farima @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 runs from @xmath30 to @xmath31 and is , for example , the same as the temporal exponent defined by brockmann et al ( their  @xmath0 \" ; our @xmath0 is their  @xmath32 \" ) . in all the following cases @xmath33 is no longer",
    "the brownian diffusion constant but simply ensures dimensional correctness in a given equation .",
    "note that we do not include the term describing the power law decay of the initial value here or in subsequent ctrw equations ( it is retained and discussed in @xcite , see their eqn .",
    "another way to relax independence is to introduce global long range dependence , as pioneered by @xcite .",
    "they used a self - affine process with a memory kernel , originally due to kolmogorov and called by them ",
    "fractional brownian motion \" .",
    "contradictory statements exist in the physics literature concerning the equivalent kinetic equation for fbm corresponding to that for ftp .",
    "it has somtimes been asserted @xcite that the equations are the same , while ftp has sometimes been labelled  fbm \" ( c.f . the supplementary material in @xcite ) .",
    "however the solution of the equation for ftp is now known to be non - gaussian @xcite , and can be given in terms of fox functions .",
    "conversely the pdf of fbm is by definition @xcite gaussian but with a variance which  stretches \" with time as @xmath34 . the correct kinetic equation for fbm must",
    "thus @xcite be local in time .",
    "it is shown in row 8 , column 3 of table 1 .",
    "given , to our knowledge , first by @xcite , it can be seen by trial solution to have a solution of the required form .",
    "the difference between ftp and fbm is striking , in that although both include temporal correlations , the kinetic equation for the ftp is non - local in time while that for fbm is local .",
    "this distinction disappears when we go to a langevin description , where both processes explicitly require fractional derivatives @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to our referee for pointing out that the kinetic equation for fbm also corresponds to a transformation of time to @xmath35 in the ordinary diffusion equation for bwbm , which we may contrast with the fractional derivative in time in the kinetic equation for ftp .",
    "we remark that if one rescales bwbm with time , the resulting increments would not be stationary whereas fbm with the same kinetic equation has stationary increments .",
    "this illustrates the point that fbm shares its kinetic equation with several other stochastic processes and so a full specification of the process thus requires more than the kinetic equation .",
    "questions similar to those in the previous section have been asked in the physics literature about the natural generalisation of the fractional time process to allow for both lvy distributions of jump lengths as well as power - law distributed waiting times .",
    "the resulting fully fractional kinetic equation is fractional in both in space and time : @xmath36 and was used by @xcite to exemplify the  ambivalent process \" .",
    "analogously with the ftp the solution for this process is known @xcite not to be a lvy - stable ( or stretched lvy - stable ) distribution but rather a convolution of such distributions .",
    "analogously to the generalisation of the ftp to the ambivalent process , there are several @xmath3-self similar levy symetric @xmath0-stable processes , described in @xcite .",
    "we here consider the simplest one , linear fractional stable motion ( lfsm ) , which generalises linear fractional brownian motion to the infinite variance case .",
    "we emphasise that lfsm is , for example , not the fractional levy motion referred to by @xcite .",
    "we can describe lfsm through a stochastic integral :    @xmath37    where the memory kernel @xmath38 is given by @xmath39\\nonumber \\\\               & + & b_2 \\large [ ( t - s)^{h-1/\\alpha}_{- } - ( -s)^{h-1/\\alpha}_{- } \\large]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xcite showed how mixed linear fractional stable motion can be obtained from @xmath24 using the lamperti transformation @xcite , a more general result which enables any self - similar process to be obtained from its corresponding stationary stochastic process .",
    "we are concerned here , however , simply with obtaining the kinetic equation .",
    "this can be found by direct differentiation of the characteristic function with respect to time ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    as with the simpler stable processes",
    "the pdf @xmath40 of lfsm can be expressed via the fourier transform of the characteristic function ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath41 we see that the characteristic function : @xmath42 generalises the olm case . because @xmath0 is no longer equal to @xmath43 the effective width parameter now grows like @xmath1 .",
    "the characteristic function has the correct fbm limit , when @xmath44 2 , we see for fbm at any given @xmath45 it is a gaussian with width growing as @xmath34 .",
    "we can see that lfsm is a general stable self - affine process by taking @xmath46 which gives @xmath47 , a stable distribution of index @xmath0 and a prefactor ensuring @xmath48selfsimilarity in time @xcite .",
    "direct differentiation of this pdf gives @xmath49 which , absorbing the constant @xmath50 , and factors of @xmath51 into @xmath33 can be recognised as @xmath52 using the above definition of the reisz derivative .",
    "surprisingly the kinetic equation of lfsm seems not have been given explicitly before in either the physics or mathematics literature .",
    "@xcite quoted an equation of motion for integrated activity in lfsm .",
    "this has a more complicated structure presumably due to additional memory effects arising from the integration process .",
    "we note that @xmath53 .",
    "this factor arises because ( [ lfsm_ke ] ) could also be obtained from the space fractional diffusion equation ( [ olm_ke ] ) by a simple transformation of the time variable : @xmath45 is replaced by @xmath1 .",
    "the appropriate limits may be easily checked ; in particular @xmath2 gives the kinetic equation of fbm .",
    "we also remark that lfsm should be a special case of the nonlinear shot noise process studied by @xcite which may allow further generalisation of the kinetic equation we have presented .",
    "intermittency is a frequently observed property in complex systems , and can be studied within several paradigms .",
    "one such , of continuing interest , has been bak et al s self - organized criticality ( soc ) , a key postulate of which is that slowly driven , interaction dominated , thresholded dynamical systems will establish long ranged correlations via  avalanches \" of spatiotemporal activity .",
    "the avalanches are found to obey power laws in size and duration . in consequence , many papers have sought to measure  bursts \" of activity in natural time series . this has most typically been done by means of a fixed threshold . the duration @xmath54 and size @xmath55 of the bursts",
    "are then respectively defined as the interval between the i - th upward crossing time ( @xmath56 ) and the next downward crossing time ( @xmath57 ) of the threshold , and the integrated area above the threshold between these times .",
    "the search for soc in the magnetosphere and solar wind has used this approach among others ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the similarity of observed burst size and duration distributions in solar wind and magnetospheric quantitities to those from models of turbulence and soc led @xcite and @xcite to conjecture that , at least qualitatively , such behaviour might simply be an artifact of a self similar ( or multifractal ) time series , rather than unique to a given mechanism .",
    "in particular this was in distinction to the idea that one could use the presence or absence of power laws in waiting times defined similarly to the above as a distinguishing feature between soc and turbulence .",
    "one of the present authors has thus elsewhere @xcite advocated the testing of avalanche diagnostics using controllable self similar models .",
    "similar points have been made subsequently by @xcite for fbm and @xcite for the multifractal random walk .    in this section",
    "we thus present a preliminary investigation of the ability of lfsm to qualitatively mimic soc signatures in data . as the kinetic equation we have derived is not unique to lfsm and",
    "is insufficient to specify all its properties in what follows we have used a numerical simulation of the process @xmath58 using the algorithm of @xcite and analytic arguments , after those of @xcite to predict the scaling of the tail of the pdf of burst size @xmath55 and duration @xmath54 in lfsm for large @xmath59 . rather than estimate the exponents from plots of the pdf or empirical complementary cdf we have elected to use maximum likelihood estimation , as implemented in the algorithms of a. clauset and co - workers ( http://www.santafe.edu/  aaronc / powerlaws/ ) . detailed comparison with measured experimental exponents",
    "is not attempted at this stage and will be the subject of future work .",
    "[ figure1 ]     for pdf @xmath60 of a burst of duration @xmath54 on @xmath3 for simulated lfsm in the fbm , @xmath2 limit .",
    "the average of 7 trials was taken.,width=340 ]    the expected behaviour of burst duration and sizes for lfsm has , as far as we know , not been investigated .",
    "dealing first with durations , we make use of the fact that for a fractal curve of self similarity exponent @xmath3 and dimension @xmath61 the points @xmath62 have dimension @xmath63 . in consequence",
    "the probability of crossings over a time interval @xmath54 goes as @xmath64 giving an inter - event probability scaling like @xmath65 .",
    "the pdf for inter - event intervals in the isoset thus scales as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 giving the same exponent @xmath68 as for the first passage distribution in the brownian case . for symmetric processes",
    "this scaling is retained by the subset of the isoset that corresponds to burst",
    " durations \" .",
    "we expect this to be independent of the detailed nature of the model and so should , in particular , also apply to lfsm .    to establish the behaviour of burst  sizes \" we note first that @xcite considered the zero - drift wiener brownian motion ( bwbm ) case . rather than their full analytic treatment ,",
    "we recap their heuristic argument for a burst size ( area ) @xmath69 defined using the first - passage time @xmath70 .",
    "this may then be adapted to burst sizes defined using isosets , and thence to lfsm .",
    "they first noted that for bwbm the instantaneous value of the random walk @xmath71 for large @xmath45 .",
    "then , defining @xmath69 by @xmath72 the integration implies that large @xmath69 scales as @xmath73 .",
    "simple inversion of this expression implies that @xmath70 must scale as @xmath74 .",
    "we independently have the standard result for first passage time for bwbm : @xmath75 . to get @xmath76 as a function of @xmath69",
    "i.e. @xmath77 one needs to insert the expression for @xmath70 as a function of @xmath69 in above equation , and in addition will need a jacobian . after these manipulations @xmath78 @xcite .    in the zero - drift but non - brownian case",
    "we will still argue that @xmath79 for large @xmath45 .",
    "as our application uses the above mentioned isoset - based burst size @xmath55 rather than those based on first passage times we define @xmath55 by : @xmath80    the rest of the argument goes as before but using ( [ pdf_beta ] ) .",
    "we find : @xmath81 where @xmath82 which we can check in the brownian case where @xmath83 to retrieve @xmath84 .    the same exponents , @xmath32 and @xmath85 , but defining the bursts using a dfa - like moving average rather than a fixed threshold , were earlier investigated , for the fbm case only , by @xcite .",
    "the format of our figures for the fbm and lfsm cases has been chosen to allow comparison with theirs .",
    "they found numerically the same dependences of @xmath32 and @xmath85 on h , as we have in equations ( [ exponent_beta ] ) and ( [ exponent_gamma ] ) above , which is intuitively reasonable with hindsight because the choice of fixed or running threshold should not change the asymptotic scaling behaviour . for a fixed threshold the burst size and duration exponents for fbm have also very recently been presented by @xcite .",
    "our numerics confirm that using the fixed threshold definition the expressions for @xmath32 and @xmath85 also describe fbm well , although the scatter , from a single trial in the case of each value of @xmath32 and @xmath85 shown in figures 3 and 4 , seems relatively high .",
    "we have reduced the scatter in figures 1 and 2 by plotting the average of the exponents over a small number of trials ( here 7 ) .",
    "the assumption that burst size @xmath55 grows with duration @xmath54 used in our heuristic derivation above can be seen to be reasonable for the fixed threshold , fbm case in figure 5 .    perhaps more surprisingly the expressions also seem to hold reasonably well when the stability exponent is reduced , first to 1.8 ( figures 6 and 7 ) and then to 1.6 ( figures 8 and 9 ) .",
    "again we note that these are averages of 7 trials in each case . by the @xmath86 case presented in figures 10 and 11 ,",
    "however , the expressions can be seen to fail . in this parameter regime , for any given @xmath3 , they are seen to consistently underestimate both the burst exponents .",
    "it has been suggested to us that this could be because @xmath87 ceases to be a good estimate of characteristic displacement when the increments of the walk are very heavy tailed ( s. majumdar , personal communication , 2006 ) but we have so far been unable to find a suitable alternative expression .",
