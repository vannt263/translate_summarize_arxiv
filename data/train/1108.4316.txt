    "* the study of transport phenomena has attracted considerable interest over the years due to its relevance in many physical situations , which are often modelled on the basis of one - dimensional particle motion in a spatially periodic potential . if the particles , in addition to their motion in the periodic potential , interact , cooperative effects not found in situations of individual particle motion , may arise .",
    "the objective of the current work is to investigate the conditions under which it is possible to generate a directed flow along with collective motion in a system of two coupled particles . to be precise , we study the transport of two particles interacting via a harmonic bond force .",
    "the individual dynamics of uncoupled particle motion , evolving in a symmetric and spatiallay periodic potential whose inclination is time - periodically modulated , is chaotic , preventing the emergence of directed particle motion . for the dynamics of the coupled particles we elucidate the possible scenario in which the energy exchange between the particles proceeds in such a well - coordinated manner that the particles move separately from one well into the next , one following the other , resulting in directed motion .",
    "notably , we demonstrate , that the dynamics of the coupled particles exhibits coherent collective directed motion provided by transporting attractors .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that for suitable coupling strengths between the particles , a completely synchronised chaotic state is attained confining the dynamics in phase space as a result of ` freezing of dimensionality ' . *",
    "transport phenomena play a fundamental role in many physical systems . for a number of applications , including josephson junctions @xcite , charge density waves @xcite , superionic conductors @xcite , rotation of dipoles in external fields @xcite , phase - locked loops @xcite and diffusion of dimers on surfaces @xcite-@xcite to quote a few",
    ", transport is based on the dynamics evolving in spatially periodic potential landscapes . when an additional external time - periodic modulation is applied to the periodic potential , interesting effects such as phase - locking",
    ", hysteresis @xcite and stochastic resonance @xcite are found .",
    "recent investigations have dealt with the hamiltonian dynamics of individual particles evolving in a periodic potential whose inclination is time - periodically varied by a weak external monochromatic modulation field @xcite . remarkably , for the corresponding one - and - a - half degree of freedom hamiltonian system it has been demonstrated that adiabatic modulations of the slope of the potential lead to the generation of transient transport dynamics related with enormous directed particle flow .",
    "an explanation for this behaviour has been given in terms of the underlying phase space structure of the externally driven one degree of freedom system promoting the motion in ballistic channels @xcite .",
    "recently interest in the collective transport dynamics of interacting particles in periodic potential landscapes has grown @xcite-@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the motion of two damped , time - periodically driven and coupled particles in a periodic potential .",
    "our aim is to demonstrate that depending on the coupling strength between the two particle subsystems a rich dynamics results ranging from hyperchaos , stable periodic running states mediating coherent particle transport , to a completely synchronised chaotic state .",
    "motion takes place in a five - dimensional phase space for which details of its intricate structures remain elusive not least due to the higher dimensionality .",
    "whether in systems with a larger number of ( microscopic ) degrees of freedom such ( macroscopic ) behaviour as collective motion leading to a directed flow emanates from higher dimensional dynamics is not obvious as also more complex forms of unstable motion , namely hyperchaos may emerge @xcite .",
    "we investigate the case when ( already ) the dynamics of a single ( uncoupled ) particle is characterised by deterministic chaos . in this context",
    "several questions arise : namely ( i ) if the chaotic motion persists in the coupled dynamics or , ( ii ) may the coupling drive the system s dynamics into a state of synchronisation , and ( iii ) may chaos even become suppressed ( see @xcite,@xcite ) ?    on the other hand , regarding coherent collective transport leading to the emergence of a directed flow it is paramount that a regime of regular periodic motion exists which is characterised by transporting attractors .",
    "such a regime of regular periodic motion needs to emerge from the coupled dynamics ( we recall that a single , uncoupled system exhibits chaos ) .",
    "these are the problems which we address .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section we introduce the model of the coupled particle system .",
    "section [ section : melnikov ] is devoted to a melnikov analysis related to homoclinic motion in the system .",
    "in the subsequent section we apply a subharmonic melnikov method to prove the persistence of periodic orbits in the coupled dynamics . in section [ section : features ] we present exact results regarding the collective particle transport mediated by periodic running solutions .",
    "the ensuing current is considered in section [ section : current ] . in [ section : complete ] we discuss the synchronisation of the coupled particle system .",
    "we prove that for overcritical coupling strength a completely synchronised state is attained .",
    "finally we summarise our results and give a brief outlook .",
    "we study the dynamics of two damped , coupled particles evolving in a spatially symmetric ( washboard ) potential of spatial period @xmath0 , with equations of motion given by @xmath1 an external time - dependent modulation of amplitude @xmath2 , frequency @xmath3 and phase @xmath4 serves for periodic modulations of the inclination of the washboard potential .",
    "we emphasise that the system is unbiased in the sense that the forces averaged over time and space vanish , i.e. @xmath5 where the potential is given by @xmath6 further , notice the exchange symmetry of the system @xmath7 .    before we embark on our study of the coupled particle dynamics we briefly consider the dynamics of a single damped and driven particle system , i.e. @xmath8 . the parameter values , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ,",
    "are chosen such that the dynamics is chaotic . to illustrate the phase flow we utilise a poincar map using the period of the external force , @xmath12 , as the stroboscopic time .",
    "the system of equations of motion was integrated numerically and omitting a transient phase , points were set in the map at times being multiples of the period duration @xmath13 .",

    "in particular we are interested in a more complex form of unstable motion which may arise in the five - dimensional phase space of the system ( [ eq : q1]),([eq : q2 ] ) , namely hyperchaos .",
    "we perform a melnikov - analysis related to homoclinic motions in system ( [ eq : q1]),([eq : q2 ] ) for weak coupling , weak forcing , and weak damping which is expressed as @xmath16 where the parameter @xmath17 indicates the perturbative character of the expressions on the r.h.s . in eqs.([eq : q1eps]),([eq : q2eps ] ) . for @xmath18 ,",

    "note that this bifurcation condition limits the maximal value of the coupling strength @xmath49 but is independent of the value of @xmath53 .    with further regard to the influence of the coupling strength @xmath49 on the behaviour of the stable and unstable manifolds the condition for the existence of zeros of the melnikov functions , as given in ( [ eq : conditionm ] ) , confines the magnitude of the product @xmath54 , viz . relates the value of @xmath49 and @xmath53 .",

    "that is , with increasing values of @xmath49 the points where the stable and unstable manifolds intersect each other transversely on the homoclinic orbits get closer to each other , giving evidence for the tendency towards synchronisation between the two particle oscillators . eventually for @xmath56",
    "the ensuing ` freezing of the dimensionality ' reduces the system to a single driven and damped pendulum ( one - and - a - half degree of freedom system ) which impedes the occurrence of hyperchaos as this is necessarily connected with expansions in several directions in phase space simultaneously ( several positive lyapunov exponents ) .",
    "nevertheless , for sufficiently small @xmath49 , simple zeros of the melnikov functions with @xmath57 exist allowing for the occurrence of hyperchaos .    in the limiting case @xmath58 in conjunction with @xmath59 the two components of each of the homoclinic melnikov vector degenerate to the melnikov functions associated with a single pendulum that is damped and periodically driven .",

    "we remark that nothing can be said about the character of the completely synchronised state of the system which can be regular but also chaotic .",
    "the exchange symmetry properties of the system ( [ eq : q1]),([eq : q2 ] ) implies that the hyperspace @xmath286 and @xmath287 constitutes the synchronisation manifold .",
    "the latter is invariant , viz .",
    "if at any moment of time the coordinates and velocities of the two particles coincide , then they will do so for all times . within",
    "the synchronisation manifold the dynamics is governed by the equation for a single particle .",
    "as established in section [ section : model ] for our choice of parameter values the dynamics of a single oscillator is characterised by a strange attractor .    in the following",
    "we investigate the stability of the synchronisation manifold .",
    "to this end we utilise the difference system given in eq.([eq : difference ] ) in terms of which the synchronisation manifold is represented by the origin @xmath288 in phase space . therefore , stabilisation of the origin in the difference system is associated with complete ( globally identical ) synchronisation of the motion of the two particles .",
    "the stability of perturbations transverse to the synchronisation manifold is governed by the largest ( transverse ) lyapunov exponent associated with the difference system @xcite . to be precise we study the corresponding tangent equation @xmath289 where @xmath290 corresponds to completely synchronous motion . in fig .",
    "[ fig : let ] the largest ( transverse ) lyapunov exponent as a function of the coupling strength is shown .    .",

    "the largest transverse lyapunov exponent becomes negative for @xmath291 indicating complete chaotic synchronisation for sufficiently strong coupling strength in compliance with the effect of ` freezing of the dimensionality ' occurring for increasing value of @xmath49 ( see section [ section : melnikov ] ) .",
    "notably , as in the completely synchronised system the coupling between the two particles vanishes , the occurrence of hyperchaos is impossible . furthermore , although the dynamics in the coherent transport regime , appearing for coupling strengths in the range @xmath245 , is regular , the corresponding transverse lyapunov exponents are positive as the dynamics does not evolve in the synchronisation manifold and the distance between the particle rather changes periodically according to eq.([eq : periodicdistance ] ) .",
    "we have considered the nonlinear dynamics of two coupled , damped and time - periodically driven particles evolving in a symmetric and spatially periodic potential .",
    "one aspect of our study has concerned the emergence of unstable , irregular motion in the coupled dynamics in the five - dimensional phase space . in order to show the existence of transverse homoclinic orbits",
    "we have invoked a homoclinic melnikov analysis .",
    "the latter has enabled us also to predict the occurrence of homoclinic bifurcations giving birth to homoclinic orbits being of importance for the existence of strange attractors .",
    "further , we have paid special attention to the influence of the coupling strength on the synchronisation features of the coupled particle system . for",
    "relatively weak coupling strengths the dynamics in the five - dimensional phase space may exhibit simultaneous expansions in several directions leading to hyperchaos . on the other hand ,",
    "we have proved that for overcritically strong coupling strengths the motion of the two particles completely synchronises .",
    "the resulting ` freezing of the dimensionality ' reduces the system to a single driven and damped pendulum , i.e. a one - and - a - half degree of freedom , impeding the emergence of hyperchaos .",
    "another aspect of our study has dealt with directed particle transport provided by running periodic solutions .",
    "notably , for parameter values for which each uncoupled particle exhibits chaotic dynamics , nevertheless , varying the coupling strength , a fairly extended window of regular periodic motion appears in the bifurcation diagram . as the periodic motion within this window of regular motion",
    "is associated with multiple coexisting transporting attractors , contributing with different weight to the net flow a non - vanishing current arises ( as a result of associated symmetry - lowering due to the choice of the phase of the external modulation ) .",
    "we have given exact results concerning the features of collective periodic transporting solutions being frequency - locked to the external time - periodic driving . in detail , we have shown that coordinated energy exchange between the particles proceeds such that they are enabled to overcome one particle followed by the other consecutive barriers of the washboard potential resulting in collective directed motion .",
    "finally , we remark that it is certainly of interest to extend the present study beyond the case of two coupled particles to infer general features of coherent many - particle transport in periodic landscapes .",
