    "structural chirality ( i.e. handedness ) often results in large mechanical couplings in filamentous supramolecular assemblies . as a classical example , twist - stretch elasticity in dna is vital during chromatin organization , transcription regulation and binding specificity during dna - complex formation  ( hagerman 1988 ; tsai 1978 ; hogan & austin 1987 ; kornberg & lorch 1995 ; mirkin 2000 ) .",
    "the morphology of the helical , rotating flagella that provide thrust to several classes of bacteria during their chemotaxis is in part dependent on the sign and extent of such mechanical couplings  ( kitao 2006 ; coombs 2002 ) .",
    "they are also expected to influence the mechanics of twisted biopolymer aggregates such as coiled - coils  ( offer 2002 ) , amyloid fibrils  ( jimenez 2002 ) , and network forming fibers such as actin , fibrin  ( weisel 1987 ; medved 1990 ) and collagen ( bozec 2007 ) .",
    "similar chiral supermolecular filaments have also been synthesized , in particular at the nanoscale . in applications which rely on physico - mechanical couplings , engineering the coupled response in structurally robust helical nanowires  ( kondo & takayanagi 2000 ) , nanobelt coils  ( pan 2001 ) , chiral nanotubes , and their assemblies",
    "offers an elegant route for fabrication of nanoscale motors , oscillators and switches by eliminating the need for externally actuated deformation  ( craighead 2000 ; baughman 1999 ; baughman 2002 ; fenimore 2003 ; papadakis 2004 ; liang & upmanyu 2005 ; liang & upmanyu 2006 ; cohen - karni 2006 ) .",
    "twist - stretch coupling in chiral , elastically stiff filaments is usually described by linearized elastica  ( love 1944 ) .",
    "well below the relevant persistence lengths , the effect of thermal fluctuations is negligible and the free energy per unit length of a straight filament subject to an axial force @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of the strain components , @xmath1 - f\\epsilon.\\ ] ] the first term is the contribution , if any , due to the change in radius of the filament . for a hollow tube of radius @xmath2 , this contribution can be expressed as a change in the bending energy of the rolled - up sheet due to its mean curvature @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 with @xmath5 the bending rigidity of the rolled up sheet .",
    "the constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the extensional and torsional rigidities of the rod , while @xmath8 couples the twist per unit length @xmath9 to axial strain @xmath10 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath8 is a measure of the interplay between structural chirality and the microscopic deformation mode .    minimizing the free energy at a fixed applied strain ( @xmath10 or @xmath9 ) yields the equilibrium conjugate strain , and therefore the effective coupling . as an example , for negligible change in the filament radius , the coupling reduces to @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the equilibrium strains induced by prescribed conjugate strains @xmath10 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "similar energy - based models have been used to describe the coupled mechanical response of b - dna  ( marko 1997 ; kamian 1997 ; bustamante 2000 ; lionnet 2006 ) , twist - storing semiflexible biopolymers  ( moroz & nelson 1998 ) , chromatin fibers  ( ben - haim 2001 ) , and bacteria flagella  ( coombs 2002 ) .",
    "this article is motivated by the recent studies on axially strained chiral single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnt ) and b - dna .",
    "surprisingly , the effective coupling @xmath14 exhibits a sign reversal in both filaments , past a critical strain @xmath15 - under compression in chiral swcnts  ( liang & upmanyu 2006 ) and in stretched b - dna  ( gore 2006 ) .",
    "evidently , the strain dependent coupled response can not be described by linearized elastica ( equations  [ eq : energyfunc ] & [ eq : eqstrains ] ) . in an attempt to understand and quantify this behaviour",
    ", we isolate the microscopic response in each case , which then serves as the physical basis for developing energetic frameworks that capture the non - linear response .",
    "the atomic - scale simulations on the swcnts were performed using the second generation reactive bond order ( rebo ) potential , which reproduces several mechanical properties of fullerenes , graphenes and diamond to a high degree of accuracy  ( brenner 2002 ) .",
    "the results discussed here are limited to the ( 8,4 ) chiral nanotube , i.e. the swcnt axis is set by the chiral vector @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the graphite basis vectors .",
    "a langevin bath was used to fix the temperature ( @xmath19k ) and the strain was applied in increments of 0.25% by displacing the end atoms ( shown masked in figure  1a ) .",
    "a conjugate gradient relaxation was performed between each successive strain step . during relaxation",
    ", the end atoms were allowed to displace along the tangential and radial directions .",
    "the reported twist ( per unit length ) is the relative rotation between the swcnt ends averaged over the net rotation of the end atoms . for details ,",

    ", the compression of the filaments proceeds via a combination of both , resulting in reorientation of the fibers and shear to the left .",

    "twist - hardening \" under compression forces the nanotube to untwist and then twist in the opposite direction .",
    "the change in its radius is negligible during this reversal , consistent with its relatively small poisson s ratio ( yakobson 1996 ; jin & yuan 2003 ) , @xmath21 .",
    "the extensional and torsional rigidities are weak functions of the swcnt chirality  ( vaccarini 2000 , jin & yuan 2003 ) , ruling out the direct effect of changes in chirality due to the induced twist .",
    "a potential source for the non - linear response is the chirality dependence of the coupling constant , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the chiral angle of the relaxed swcnt and @xmath24 is a constant  ( liang & upmanyu 2006 ) .",
    "this specific form satisfies the symmetry constraints , in particular the six fold symmetry of the underlying graphitic lattice , and leads to terms in higher powers of @xmath9 and a strain dependent coupling , @xmath25 however , the effect of these higher order terms is small for the high chirality swcnts for which the coupling has been observed ( @xmath26 ) as @xmath27 and the ratio @xmath28 over the sign reversal range , effectively ruling out chirality dependence of the coupling constant as the basis for the observed strain dependent coupled response .",
    "microscopic analyses of the strain dependence of the bond lengths and bond angles within the simulations reveal that the reversal coincides with that in the trend associated with one of the three bond angles between the carbon atoms on the swcnt surface ( angle @xmath29 , see figure  [ fig : swcntresults ] ) .",
    "this change in the mechanism of strain accommodation effectively softens the nanotube surface with respect to shear , which modifies the otherwise affine response of the graphene network .",
    "the helically coiled graphene elements slide past each other and the enhanced surface shear counteracts the tendency to increase the swcnt handedness .",
    "an analogous , two - dimensional response is illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : swcntresults ] ( inset , bottom left ) for a sheet with bare elastic anisotropy which now couples the compression to its shear .",
    "the deformation of the anisotropic layer responsible for the coupled response , in particular the ratio of layer compression to intra - layer slip , controls the direction of the shear .",
    "the basis for this effect is an additional elastic anisotropy term in equation  [ eq : energyfunc ] that we have ignored so far because it is weakly chirality dependent  ( gartstein 2003 ) , @xmath30 cleary this term becomes important at large axial strains , with the leading contribution of the form @xmath31 , with @xmath32 a constant . incorporating this term and maximizing the resultant energy functional ,",
    "we recover a strain dependent equilibrium twist and the critical axial strain associated with the twist reversal , @xmath33 for the ( 8,4 ) swcnt , @xmath34nnnm@xmath35 , @xmath36nnnm and @xmath37  ( vaccarini 2000 ; liang & upmanyu 2006 ) , which yields the higher order coupling constant , @xmath38nnm .    .",
    "[ fig : femresults],width=377 ]    the strain dependent coupling points to an elegant design principle whereby the imposed strain can be used to engineer the coupling by effecting transitions in the microscopic deformation .",
    "can we then fashion the structure so as to evoke the desired coupled response ? as an answer , we study the coupled response in an identically structured model ( 8,4 ) chiral nanotube with simplified interactions .",

    "the young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the beam element material are fixed at @xmath41gpa and @xmath42 .",
    "these elements can either stretch or bend in order to absorb the imposed axial strain ; the twisting of the beams is negligible and ignored . the energy stored in bending and stretching scales quadratically with the deformation variables , @xmath10 and the beam curvature @xmath43 .",
    "the shape of the beams is important as it allows us to independently control the energetic competition between beam bending and stretching , the dimensionless ratio @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the moment of inertia of each beam .",

    "a non - linear solver is employed to ensure that the errors at high axial strains are minimal .",
    "the axial strain and measurement of the induced twist is performed as in the swcnt case .",
    "in addition , strain dependence of the deformations of the individual beams are also monitored .",
    "simulations for varying values of @xmath50 indicate that the small strain coupling is consistent with the chirality , i.e. the twist changes sign with the axial strain ( figure  [ fig : femresults ] ) . remarkably , the large strain response is sensitive to the value of @xmath50 and is quite rich .",
    "it varies from no reversal ( @xmath51 ) , to reversal under compression ( @xmath52 ) and even tension ( @xmath46 ) .    in order to gain a more rigorous understanding of the @xmath50 dependence of the coupled response",
    ", we have analysed the microscopic energetics of the individual beam elements as a function of the applied strain .",
    "figures [ fig : femanalysis]a ( @xmath52 ) and [ fig : femanalysis]b ( @xmath46 ) show plots of energies associated with bending and stretching the beam elements for the entire filament as well as for the three unique beam elements ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) within a unit hexagonal cell on the filament surface .",
    "for the low @xmath50 filament , change in the coupling sign ( shaded region ) follows a gradual change in the energetic competition between bending and stretching under compression , with main contributors to this change being beams @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "a similar transition is observed under tension for the high @xmath50 filament .",
    "the balance in the energy stored in beam @xmath49 distinctly shifts towards stretching at about the same strain level at which we see the reversal in the coupling for the entire filament ( shaded region ) .",
    "finally , no such reversal in trends is observed for the intermediate @xmath50 ( @xmath53 ) filament ( not shown ) , where the coupling more or less remains constant at all strains ( figure  [ fig : femresults ] ) .",
    "the fact that this simplified model captures the essence of the swcnt response indicates that the behaviour is both scale and model independent .",
    "the variations in the coupling are a direct reflection of the transitions in the microscopic energetic balance , quite like the observed surface shear instability in swcnts .",
    "each transition disrupts the trends in the microscopic distortions , changing the sign of the coupling .",
    "while the small strain response is controlled by the chirality , the strain dependence of the coupling arises due to atomic - scale transitions in the deformation modes .",
    "the effect is captured in an elastica - based framework by a higher order coupling constant @xmath54 which depends on the microscopic energetic balance and therefore modifies the energetic coupling between stretching and twisting the filament .",

    "[ fig : dnaresults ] , title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]    in b - dna , the sign reversal of the effective twist - stretch coupling observed in rotor bead experiments by gore  ( 2006 ) on sufficiently long individual molecules occurs past the entropic elastic regime .",
    "the bend fluctuations are frozen and the molecule behaves like a chiral elastic rod  ( kamian 1997 ; bustamante 2000 ) . the critical strain associated with",
    "the reversal is well below that corresponding to the force at which the molecule undergoes a structural transition  ( smith 2006 ; bustamante 2000 ; lionnet  2006 ; wereszczynski & andricioaei 2006 ) . the microscopic basis for sign reversal appears to be different from that in the swcnts as the response may involve a substantial decrease in the dna radius owing to its large poisson s ratio ( @xmath55 ) , i.e. @xmath56 with @xmath57 the relaxed effective radius  ( gore 2006 ; lionnet 2006 ) .",
    "then , when the extension is prescribed , the coupled response is modified due to radius dependence of torsional rigidity @xmath7 , in addition to that of the coupling parameter @xmath8 . ignoring the direct effect of chirality change , the torsional rigidity scales as @xmath58 . for short - range elastic interactions , scaling and",
    "symmetry considerations require that for harmonic distortions the coupling @xmath59 constant is an odd function of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath60 , where @xmath61 are constants .",
    "in general , these constants will also be function of the helicity of the dna which may change with the change in radius .",
    "we ignore this relatively smaller effect .",
    "we further assume that the double - stranded dna behaves as a chiral rod composed of a material with bare surface anisotropy , i.e. the surface shear associated with the twist @xmath62 is non - zero for @xmath63 . as comparison ,",
    "note that in the case of swcnts , the leading order term must be @xmath64 as the coupling is purely curvature derived , yet the graphite sheet is isotropic  ( liang & upmanyu 2006 ) .",

    ", we get @xmath81pnnm@xmath35 and @xmath82pnnm@xmath83  ( bustamante 2000 ; gore 2006 ) . the predicted equilibrium twist as a function of the stretch is in excellent agreement with the experimental data , plotted in figure  [ fig : dnaresults ] . however , the agreement rapidly breaks down past the critical strain , possibly due to increasing anharmonicity in the deformation  ( wiggins 2006 ) and/or an increase in the chirality dependence of the coupling constant .",
    "the analysis reveals that the magnitude of coupling constant ( also plotted ) decreases more rapid than that predicted by gore  ( 2006 ) . in effect , stretched b - dna always decreases its chiral character .",
    "while the molecular strain accommodation mechanism is yet to be established , it manifests as a decrease in the effective radius of the molecule and the molecule overwinds initially .",
    "thereafter , the balance tilts in favour of the chirality dependent response such that the coupling changes its sign and then the molecule begins to unwind .",
    "the swcnt and b - dna response both highlight the link between the microscopic strain accommodation behaviour and the macroscopic coupling . in the swcnt case",
    ", we have clear evidence that the interplay between chirality and geometry is modified by the microscopic energetics , a general design principle for tailoring the extent and sign of the coupled response .",
    "this could be achieved by changing the chemistry of the nanofilament , for example , and has direct relevance for tailoring the response of helical nanowires  ( kondo & takayanagi 2000 ; tosatti & prestipino 2000 ) , coiled nanobelts  ( pan 2001 ) , and nanotube ropes  ( liang & upmanyu 2005 ) . in each case",
    ", the extent of the response can modify the electromechanical couplings that can be easily exploited in nems and nanoelectronics .",
    "our analysis on b - dna shows that the same design principles are also important in semiflexible , soft chiral filaments .",
    "the change in radius of the stretched filament is likely to be controlled by the stiffness of the sugar phosphate backbone relative to that of the base - pair interactions across the strands .",
    "similar energetic balance may also be responsible for the twist - stretch coupling recently extracted in chromatin strands  ( bancaud 2006 ) , although structural transitions may play a more important role there .",
    "identification of such energetics is critical for understanding the coupled response in fibrillar assemblies such as coiled - coils and twisted protein aggregates .",
    "an important consequence of the non - linearities is that they also modify the effective rigidity and electromagnetic character of these elastic filaments .",
    "the extensional rigidity of the ( 8,4 ) swcnt develops an additional dependence on the induced twist , @xmath84 as a result , the nanotube softens rapidly as it is stretched and is the stiffest when compressed to the critical strain .",
    "a @xmath85 stretch induces a @xmath86 softening .",
    "the effective torsional rigidity @xmath87 changes primarily due to the twist induced change in chirality .",
    "this effect is substantial - a 2% axial strain leads to a 20% change in the rigidity ( see figure  [ fig : rigdata]a ) .",
    "the reduction the stretch rigidity is also seen in b - dna , where the radius dependence of the rigidities ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) is additionally modified by that of the coupling constant @xmath8 ( figure  [ fig : rigdata]b ) , an effect that further amplifies the unusually large ratio of the twist to stretching / bending rigidity at high strains .",
    "similar softening may also be responsible for the large stretching strains that can be absorbed by twisted fibrin polymers  ( liu 2006 ) , a crucial requirement for the overall viscoelastic properties of blood clots .    the electromagnetic character of these nanofilaments must depend on the sign and extent of these couplings .",
    "it is well - known that the swcnt band gap can be tuned by uniaxial and torsional deformation  ( minot 2003 ) .",
    "close to the fermi level , the change in band - gap is the highest for achiral nanotubes .",
    "the presence of this natural coupling in chiral swcnts , ignored in these analyses , should increase the efficiency of strain engineered band gaps ( mu , in preparation ) . while there is considerable debate on the electronic properties of dna  ( dekker & ratner 2001 )",
    ", it is clear that the the inherent coupling must be accounted for in understanding the interplay between their flexibility and electronic transport .",
    "there are several similar examples where nature has dynamically engineered such mechanical couplings .",
    "spiral growth of filamentous algae and fungi ( e.g. _ phycomyces blakesleeanus _ ) is associated with a sinistral to dextral reversal  ( castle 1942 ; green 1954 ) , a transition in the deformation mode in the fibrillar structure of the cell wall in response to turgor pressure  ( ortega & gamow 1974 ) .",
    "the sinistral growth occurs via reorientation of initially transverse microfibrils along the growth direction , while the dextral growth immediately following the sporangium formation is dominated by inter - fibril slip  ( ortega & gamow 1974 ) ( figure  [ fig : nateg]a ) .",
    "the microscopic response is essentially what we see in the uniaxially strained swcnts .",
    "control studies have shown that the reversal can also be achieved if the cell wall is allowed to grow laterally  ( yoshida 1980 ) , a combination of the design principles underlying the swcnt and b - dna response .    a similar mechanism",
    "may also be involved in the propulsion of _ spiroplasma _ , a helical wall - less bacteria that infects several plants and insects  ( whitcomb 1980 ) .",
    "the undulations that enable it to swim are due to the formation and propagation of kinks , or local reversals in its chirality , along its length  ( shaevitz 2005 ) .",
    "the tapered or bulbous ends of the bacteria can facilitate the nucleation the kinks due to motors that generate and then transmit localised axial strains .",
    "another example is the cell wall mediated grain spiral decrease and reversal in drying trunks of conifers ( figure  [ fig : nateg]b ) , initiating at the trunk base  ( preston 1950 ; kubler 1991 ) . since the thicker base supports the maximum stress , it likely serves as the origin for changes in cell wall microstructure which eventually express as grain spiral reduction and reversal . in each case , geometry and the imposed strain effect transitions in the interplay between structural chirality and the dominant deformation mode . from a teleological perspective , strain engineering such microstructural transitions is a powerful instrument allowing dynamic control of the coupling .",
