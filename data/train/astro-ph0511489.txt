    "in the last few years , our understanding of the reionization history of the universe has greatly improved thanks to the detection of quasars at increasingly high redshift ( e.g. , becker et al .",
    "2001 ; fan et al .",
    "2002 ; hu et al .",
    "2002 ; white et al .",
    "2003 ) and the new data on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation from wmap ( bennet et al .",
    "observations from high redshift quasars indicate a fast increase of the intensity of the ionizing background with cosmic time occurring at @xmath4 , probably signalling the end of reionization ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ) , or the epoch when the low - density intergalactic medium ( hereafter , igm ) became fully ionized .",
    "reionization is expected to have occurred over an extended period of time , during which sources gradually reionized every atom in the igm ( e.g. , gnedin 2000 ) .",
    "indeed , the detection of ly@xmath5  emission from sources at @xmath6 ( hu et al .  2002 ; kodaira et al .  2003 ; cuby et al .  2003 ; kneib et al .  2004 ; rhoads et al .",
    "2004 ) that are not highly luminous to have produced large regions around them implies that the igm could not be fully neutral at the redshift of these sources , otherwise such photons would have been scattered out of the line of sight ( miralda - escud & rees 1998 ; madau & rees 2000 ) .",
    "another important probe to the epoch of reionization is the optical depth to electron scattering of cmb photons , @xmath7 .",
    "the first measurement of @xmath7 was reported by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ mission ; although its value is still rather uncertain ( kogut et al .  2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , the measurement favored an early start to reionization , such that the fractional ionization of the igm would have reached 50% at @xmath8 .",
    "it is worth noting that this does not by itself contradict the appearance of the gunn - peterson trough ( which marks the end of reionization ) at @xmath4 , because reionization may advance gradually over a long period of time .",
    "however , an early start of reionization presents a problem in the cold dark matter model of structure formation , in which only a small fraction of matter has collapsed into halos that can form stars at @xmath9 , and therefore one needs to assume a very high rate of emission of ionizing photons from this first generation of stars ( e.g. , haiman & holder 2003 ; chiu , fan , & ostriker 2003 ; onken & miralda - escud 2004 ) .",
    "one possibility is that the first collapsed halos in which gas was able to cool were efficient in driving gas to accrete onto central black holes that were formed by the core collapse of the first massive stars .",
    "however , as argued by dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , any such population of high-@xmath10 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) would likely contribute a smooth component to the present x - ray background at energies near @xmath11 kev that may be higher than is allowed by observational constraints ( although significant calibration uncertainties of the x - ray background intensity remain which could increase the upper limit on the fraction of the x - ray background in a smooth component ) .",
    "the other possibility is that the first massive stars , which were metal - free and highly efficient at producing ionizing photons , were responsible for an early reionization ( oh et al .",
    "2001 , yoshida et al .",
    "2003 , sokasian et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "much work has been done to characterize the properties of these metal - free stars ( abel et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 1999 , 2002 ; oh et al .  2001 ) .",
    "the formation of the first stars was governed by molecular hydrogen radiative cooling , which becomes effective at gas temperatures above @xmath12 k ( yoshida et al .",
    "this virial temperature is first reached in halos of total mass @xmath13 m@xmath14  , which start becoming substantially abundant at @xmath15 .",
    "metal - free stars have higher effective surface temperatures than their metal - rich counterparts during their main - sequence phase . in addition , they are nearly fully convective and can burn most of their hydrogen content during their main - sequence lifetime .",
    "this makes them highly efficient as producers of ionizing radiation ( emitting @xmath16 ionizing photons per baryon ; schaerer 2002 ) , most of which can escape into the igm due to the small amount of gas in the host halos .    despite these advantages of metal - free stars as sources of ionizing radiation , the idea that these stars may have been responsible for an early reionization faces a number of difficulties .",
    "first , it is unlikely that many massive stars might form simultaneously in the first halos where star formation took place , which have low velocity dispersion and can therefore easily lose their gas after it is heated by photoionization and supernova explosions .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that one central massive star will initially form , with a mass of @xmath17 m@xmath14  ( e.g. , abel et al .  2002 ; bromm et al .",
    "2002 ) , containing a fraction of only @xmath18 of the baryonic mass of the halo from which it formed .",
    "the ionization and the supernova explosion resulting from this star can then eject the rest of the gas from the halo ( bromm , yoshida , & hernquist 2003 ; whalen , abel , & norman 2004 , kitayama et al .",
    "2004 ) , yielding a very low efficiency to form stars . later ,",
    "when the gas falls back into a halo with a total mass increased by the merging process , it will already be enriched by metals and will form the next generation of stars with properties that are presumably similar to present stellar populations in normal galaxies .",
    "if the metal - free star releases about @xmath19 of metals , a total mass of @xmath20 of baryons may be polluted to a metallicity of @xmath21 , above which cooling is already modified by the presence of metals , while the emission properties of massive stars are also modified for even lower metallicities . in cases where a metal - free star collapses into a black hole releasing no metals ,",
    "any cold gas reaching the halo center at a later time will also not form another metal - free star because the black hole will be in the center .",
    "the second difficulty is that the radiation emitted by these first stars can act as a negative feedback mechanism to slow down the formation of other metal - free stars in new collapsed halos with pristine gas .",
    "a widely studied effect is photodissociation of molecular hydrogen ( haiman , abel , & rees 2000 ) .",
    "another feedback effect is the heating of the igm by x - rays emitted by supernovae or by the metal - free main - sequence stars themselves ( oh & haiman 2003 ) , which raises the entropy of gas accreting into halos , resulting in a more stringent requirement for the gas to cool .",
    "this effect has not been so widely studied as the molecular photodissociation one , but as we shall see below it may be even more important .    the aim of this paper is to determine the maximum possible contribution to reionization from zero metallicity stars , under the assumption that only one such star forms in each halo , with a fixed stellar mass .",
    "special attention will be paid to the way that the radiative feedback mechanisms of photodissociation and x - ray heating limit the formation rate of these metal - free stars .",
    "we shall use a semianalytic model based on merger trees ( similar to the approach of , e.g. , haiman et al .  2000 and wise & abel 2005 ) , including a new ingredient to compute the halo age distribution and derive the fraction of halos that contain a metal - free main - sequence star at any given time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ smethod ] , we present our method to calculate the formation rate of metal - free stars , the photodissociating and x - ray background they create , and how these radiation backgrounds affect the formation rate by altering the entropy profile in collapsed halos and the molecular hydrogen abundance .",
    "the results are presented in ",
    "[ res ] , showing how each of the two feedback effects we consider impact the rate at which metal - free stars can form and their contribution to reionization .",
    "a discussion of these results follows in   [ sdisc ] .",
    "our central assumption in this paper is that when a halo that contains metal - free gas ( i.e. , a halo for which no star has previously formed in any of its merger - tree progenitors ) collapses , a single massive star forms at the halo center after a cooling time .",
    "the mass of this star is assumed to be constant for all halos with metal - free gas . as explained in detail later (   [ sstform ] ) , the star forms in our model if the cooling time of the gas at the center of the halo is shorter than the lifetime of the halo .",
    "we develop an algorithm to define the lifetime of halos from the merger tree framework based on the extended press - schechter model , which is fully described in the appendix .",
    "the cooling time depends on the central gas density and temperature , which depends at the same time on the initial entropy of the gas prior to the collapse of the halo ( e.g. , oh & haiman 2003 ) .",
    "we compute the initial central gas density ( prior to the onset of cooling ) in halos at each redshift self - consistently , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium in a halo with the navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 ) density profile for the dark matter ( hereafter , nfw ) .",
    "we calculate the ionizing radiation emitted by the metal - free stars to infer the history of reionization ( taking into account an escape fraction of ionizing photons from halos determined by recombinations in the halo gas ) , as well as the feedback effects of x - ray heating ( and consequent entropy raise of the atomic medium , which affects the gas density profiles in halos ) and molecular photodissociation .",
    "we also include a component of ionizing radiation from a normal stellar population assumed to form in metal - enriched halos , which have had previous star formation and ionization .",
    "this section explains in detail how all these ingredients are implemented in our model .",
    "our goal will be to find the maximum contribution that these metal - free stars could plausibly make to an early reionization , and how this is limited by the minimal expected feedback effects .",
    "we use the halo mass function of sheth & tormen ( 2002 ) .",
    "we assume that a first - generation star forms when the halo age exceeds the cooling time at the halo center .",
    "we adopt for this purpose the definition of halo formation time of lacey & cole ( 1993 ) , which is the time when the halo mass was half the present one .",
    "the probability distribution of the age of a halo as a function of its mass and redshift is calculated following lacey & cole , which we then use to compute the probability that a halo contains a metal - free star as described in the appendix .      to determine the cooling time at the halo center , we assume the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the halo gravitational potential , and that the dark matter follows a nfw density profile with concentration parameter @xmath22 . in reality",
    ", @xmath23 depends on the halo mass and redshift ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ; eke et al .",
    "2001 ) , but here we approximate it as constant and with the same value used by oh & haiman  ( 2003 ) .    under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , the gas density profile depends on its temperature .",
    "shock - heating of the gas during the collapse heats the gas to a roughly constant temperature , about equal to the halo virial temperature .",
    "this results in a final gas density profile similar to the dark matter , although with a small , constant density core , with a size that is determined by the minimum entropy @xmath24 of the gas in the halo .",
    "the gas with the lowest entropy is generally the one that is shock - heated to the virial temperature only after reaching a high density , and ends up near the halo center .",
    "however , if the gas had already been heated prior to the collapse , acquiring a high initial entropy , the value of @xmath24 may be increased , resulting in a much more extended gas profile and reduced central gas density , and therefore a much longer central cooling time . to take this into account",
    "we follow the procedure explained in oh & haiman  ( 2003 ) .",
    "we define the function @xmath25 as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the adiabatic index ( equal to @xmath28 for monatomic gas ) , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 the gas temperature and number density .",
    "note that the entropy of a gas is actually the logarithm of @xmath25 , although in this paper we refer to the function @xmath25 as `` entropy '' for convenience .",
    "the entropy before the collapse is what we call the entropy floor , @xmath31 , which we calculate as a function of redshift as described in ",
    "[ xr ] .    as an example",
    ", we show in figure [ fprof ] the gas density profile in a halo with @xmath32 m@xmath14  formed at different redshifts .",
    "the initial entropy is fixed to the primordial value given in oh & haiman ( 2003 ) , determined by early compton heating by the cmb on the adiabatically cooling gas , with the residual ionized fraction left over from recombination . at @xmath33 ,",
    "the entropy of the igm is practically constant and the entropy floor decreases in importance with decreasing redshift because of the decreasing gas density , hence the gas density profile becomes steeper at low redshift .",
    "we show also the effect of raising the igm temperature to @xmath34 k at @xmath35 , which leads to a large reduction in the central gas density .",
    "we define the cooling timescale as the ratio of the internal energy of the gas to the cooling rate per unit of volume , @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we include only molecular hydrogen cooling for metal - free gas . in practice ,",
    "atomic cooling can be neglected because metal - free stars form very rarely in halos with virial temperature above @xmath39 k in our model .",
    "the reason is that these halos usually have some progenitor of lower virial temperature that has already formed a star previously ( this will be seen in fig .  2 ) .",
    "in this case , we consider that the gas is already enriched with metals and that the emissivity per unit mass is constant , as described in  [ semis_met_rich ] .    the cooling rate ( due to collisional excitation of molecular hydrogen roto - vibrational lines ) is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the molecular fraction .",
    "we use the cooling function @xmath42 of galli & palla  ( 1998 ) . the molecular fraction @xmath41 is determined by the continuous formation of molecules in the gas from @xmath43 , which is at the same time made by the primordial concentration of electrons from the recombination epoch ( see tegmark et al .",
    "we use equation ( 16 ) of tegmark et al . , although simplified and modified to consider h@xmath44  dissociation in the following way : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the dissociation rate ( which we discuss later in   [ sdiss ] ) and @xmath47 is the electron fraction , given by equation ( [ xr : fe ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath48 determines the formation rate of @xmath43 ( which determines the formation rate of molecules ) , and is given by @xmath49 @xmath50 s@xmath51 .",
    "the initial , primordial value of @xmath41 is taken as @xmath52 ( galli & palla  1998 ) . note that the fraction of hydrogen that forms molecules from @xmath43 within collapsed halos is much larger than this primordial value , and therefore the long - term evolution of the molecular hydrogen fraction does not strongly depend on its initial value .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the main assumption in this work is that only one metal - free star is formed in each halo that collapses from progenitors that have never formed a star previously .",
    "the mass of the star , @xmath53 , is much lower than the baryonic mass of the halo , and is in fact lower than the gas mass in the core of the gas distribution .",
    "consequently , we can evaluate the cooling time at the halo center and consider that the star will form when the age of the halo is equal to this cooling time .",
    "the star forms in a halo of mass @xmath54 with formation time @xmath55 at a time @xmath56 that obeys @xmath57 the star will then live up to a time @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the main - sequence lifetime of a metal - free star with mass @xmath60 .",
    "the probability that a halo of mass @xmath54 at time @xmath61 has already formed a star can be evaluated by computing first numerically the formation time @xmath62 that obeys equation ( [ cool_c1 ] ) with @xmath63 , and then calculating the probability @xmath64 that the halo formation time is earlier than @xmath62 ( see eq .  [ 2.26 ] of lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "similarly , the probability that the halo contains a metal - free star on the main - sequence at time @xmath61 is evaluated as the probability @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the solution of @xmath55 of equation ( [ cool_c2 ] ) when @xmath67 .",
    "this condition , however , would be valid only if the halo gas were always metal - free . in reality , if a star had already formed in one of the halo progenitors , the supernova explosion from that star would already have polluted the gas with metals and blown it away . later on , as the sequence of halo mergers continues , the final halo present at time @xmath61 will accrete this gas , but since the gas is metal enriched it will form metal - rich stars . the emission from metal - rich stars will be treated differently in our model , as we describe later in ",
    "[ semis_met_rich ] . here",
    ", our main assumption is that the very massive stars we consider that are highly efficient at emitting ionizing radiation are formed only when the gas is totally free of heavy elements .    to take this into account",
    ", we evaluate at each time @xmath61 the average number of metal - free stars that have formed in a halo of mass @xmath54 , as ( see the appendix ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of halos of mass between @xmath70 and @xmath71 at time @xmath72 that have been incorporated into a halo of mass @xmath54 at time @xmath61 ( see eq .  [ 2.25 ] in lacey & cole 1993 ) , and @xmath73 is the probability per unit time that a star forms at @xmath72 in a halo of mass @xmath70 . the way the probability @xmath74 is calculated is described in the appendix .",
    "we then assume that there is a poisson distribution of the number of stars that have formed within any halo , so that the probability that none has formed is @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the probability that a halo of mass @xmath54 harbours a main - sequence star at time @xmath61 is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the differential probability that a halo at time @xmath61 was formed at time @xmath55 and is given by equation ( 2.19 ) in lacey & cole ( 1994 ) . in practice , the lifetime of the main - sequence star ( @xmath78 years ) is short enough that the above integral can be approximated as @xmath79 figure [ fnstarm ] shows the probability that a halo with mass @xmath54 harbours a metal - free main - sequence star .",
    "different plots correspond to different redshifts ( @xmath80 , 15 , 10 , and 6 ) , and different lines to different models that will be described later .",
    "the model a1 corresponds to no feedback effects on the formation of metal - free stars , and the other models incorporate feedback effects that are described in  2.5 .",
    "the probability to contain a star tends to peak at halo masses of several times @xmath81 . at lower masses",
    "the molecular cooling rate is too slow and stars have not yet formed , while in halos of higher mass a metal - free star has typically already formed in one of their lower - mass progenitors ( i.e. , the second term in eq.is very small ) .    as a byproduct",

    "\\label{dndt}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the metal - free star formation rate and @xmath84 is the sheth - tormen halo mass function .",
    "this last formula is useful to calculate the preheating due to x - rays ( see section [ xr ] ) .",
    "we consider three feedback processes that affect metal - free star formation .",
    "the first is halo photoevaporation due to the ionizing background ( section   [ sevap ] ) .",
    "the second , photodissociation of molecules due to a soft ultraviolet background ( section   [ sdiss ] ) .",
    "finally , the third is reheating of the igm caused by x - rays ( section   [ xr ] ) .",
    "the ionizing background reheats the gas in halos and causes a large increase in the entropy floor .",
    "gas trapped in minihalos escapes ( e.g. , shapiro et al .",
    "2004 ) , quenching star formation . cooling and star formation in reionized regions can only occur in halos that are massive enough for the gas to undergo dissipation by atomic cooling .",
    "we neglect any possible formation of metal - free stars in these halos . in practice ,",
    "once these halos collapse they should almost always have a progenitor that already formed a metal - free star in the past , because the number of halo progenitors increases with halo mass ; moreover , even if one metal - free star may form in one of these more massive halos cooling mainly by atomic processes , their contribution to the total number of metal - free stars formed should be negligible because the abundance of high - mass halos is greatly reduced compared to halos of low mass .",
    "we therefore neglect any possible formation of metal - free stars in reionized regions . to take this into account , equation ( [ prob_sh_star ] )",
    "is multiplied by a factor @xmath85 , equal to the fraction of the igm that is neutral at every redshift .",
    "the calculation of the ionized fraction of the igm as a function of time using the global rate of star formation that we compute is described below in  2.6 . actually , the factor @xmath86 represents a lower limit to the suppression of the star formation by reionization , because in practice halos are correlated , or biased relative to the mass , so that more halos should be present in the reionized regions where other high - mass halos have already formed .",
    "is easily photodissociated by soft ultra - violet photons ( haiman et al .",
    "the rate at which dissociation is produced can be approximated by ( abel et al .",
    "1997 ) @xmath87 being @xmath88 the flux at frequency @xmath89 in units of @xmath90 and @xmath91 the self - shielding factor given by draine & bertoldi  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the mean free path of dissociating photons in the igm is typically larger than the mean distance between minihalos .",
    "therefore , this flux can be approximated as homogeneous and isotropic . to calculate this background",
    "we apply equation ( 7 ) of haiman et al .",
    "the emissivity of dissociating photons ( @xmath92 in their formula ) is computed similarly to that of ionizing ones ( see  [ semis_met_free ] ) , although we take into account only the emission by the metal - free stars .",
    "emission from the metal - rich stars has a small effect at the high redshifts of interest , which we have neglected .",
    "as proposed by oh & haiman ( 2003 ) , soft x - ray photons raise the entropy floor , greatly reducing cooling and star formation in low - mass halos .",
    "x - rays can have a long mean free path through the atomic igm and can therefore heat this medium in an approximately uniform way , whereas the more abundant ultraviolet ionizing photons heat the medium only near the boundaries of hii regions .",
    "the mean free path in the atomic igm is roughly @xmath93 when this mean free path is in the range that goes from the mean distance between neighboring halos containing first - generation stars ( which is about @xmath94 kpc at @xmath95 ; see yoshida et al .",
    "2003 ) to the horizon radius ( @xmath96 mpc at @xmath95 ) , the photons are effective at heating the atomic igm .",
    "this corresponds to a range of frequencies from 200 ev to 2 kev , or the soft x - ray band .",
    "soft x - ray photons can be produced by metal - free stars during two phases .",
    "first , these stars have a high enough effective temperature during the main sequence lifetime to emit substantially in soft x - rays ( schaerer 2002 ) .",
    "second , x - rays can be emitted by the hot gas in a supernova remnant after the death of the star .",
    "for simplicity we consider that all the emission is produced at the end of the metal - free star lifetime ( a good approximation because of the short lifetime ) .",
    "therefore , the rate of increase of the entropy floor is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the rate of energy increase per particle , @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the rate of sne per unit of volume , equal to the star formation rate @xmath101 ( eq .  [ [ dndt ] ] ) at the time @xmath102 .",
    "the constant @xmath103 is the total energy per star that is used to reheat the medium .",
    "note that this is not the same as the total energy radiated in x - rays by the star since some of that energy goes into collisional ionizations or emission of recombination photons .",
    "we leave the value of @xmath103 as a free parameter in our model ( the range of possible values is discussed in  [ sres_xr ] ) .    even though the reheating by x - rays is roughly homogeneous , the increase of the entropy is of course lower in regions of high gas density . to compute the entropy floor for a specific halo with formation at @xmath55 , we follow the evolution of the gas density during the collapse assuming the spherical top - hat model , and we compute the entropy increase from the previous history of the intensity of the x - ray background generated by metal - free stars . the evolution of @xmath100 is computed self - consistently with the model from the star formation rate .",
    "heating by x - rays is no longer taken into account after virialization ( this would be negligible in any case once the gas has reached a high density ) .",
    "x - rays have yet another effect : owing to secondary ionizations , they can produce a higher ionized fraction than the residual value after recombination ( which is @xmath104 , see galli & palla  1998 ) .",
    "this increases the formation rate of molecular hydrogen , enhancing the cooling rate ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1996 ) . according to shull & van steenberg ( 1985 ) , around 30 % of the total energy in x - rays",
    "is used in ionizations when the neutral fraction is high .",
    "the rate of ionizations is then found by dividing expression ( [ e : reh ] ) by 13.6 ev ( the ionization energy of hydrogen ) . considering this effect ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath105 is determined by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the recombination rate , which can be approximated by @xmath108 s@xmath51 ( hutchins 1976 ) and @xmath30 is the gas number density in the halo center after collapse . before collapse , the first term is negligible because the density is very low .",
    "the initial value of @xmath105 is given by the residual ionized fraction after recombination .",
    "to summarize , for each halo mass at a fixed time , stars can form only when the formation time satisfies equation ( [ cool_c1 ] ) . when considering feedback effects , cooling is delayed and therefore halo formation has to take place earlier .",
    "consequently , the probability that a halo hosts a main sequence star in equation ( [ prob_sh_star ] ) decreases , reflecting the feedback effects .      to calculate the reionization history of the igm we must first calculate the emissivity @xmath109 of ionizing photons per igm baryon .",
    "we consider two contributions to the emissivity , one from metal - free stars which we discuss in   [ semis_met_free ] , and another from stars with metals , discussed in   [ semis_met_rich ] .",
    "finally , we explain the procedure to calculate the reionization history in   [ semis_met_free ] .",
    "metal - free stars emit a higher quantity of ionizing photons than enriched stars ( see schaerer  ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "we use here the fitting formula in table 6 of schaerer  ( 2002 ) to compute the ionizing luminosity of each star as a function of its mass , @xmath110 . for the values of @xmath53",
    "we consider here , this yields @xmath111 s@xmath51 and @xmath112 s@xmath51 .",
    "in addition , we take into account that some of the stellar photons may be absorbed locally in the halo gas surrounding the star , and only a fraction @xmath113 of these photons will be able to escape and ionize the igm .",
    "we use the following simple model to compute @xmath113 ( see whalen et al .",
    "2004 for a more complete discussion and several examples of the evolution of the regions formed around a metal - free star ) : we assume that the star is initially surrounded by a distribution of atomic gas following a singular isothermal profile .",
    "an region grows around the star , and the heated gas acquires a sound speed of @xmath114 and starts expanding .",
    "this speed is typically larger than the halo circular velocity , but still smaller than the speed of the ionization front as long as the escape fraction is not very small and the star is capable of ionizing the halo ( the stellar lifetime is @xmath115 3 million years , which is short compared to the crossing time of the halo at this sound speed .",
    "hence , the ionization front advances supersonically .",
    "we use the simple approximation where all the gas moves out by the same distance @xmath116 .",
    "the gas distribution then has a central hole of radius @xmath117 , and at @xmath118 the density is @xmath119\\frac{[r - r{_{\\rm c}}(t)]^2}{r^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the initial gas number density profile of the halo .",
    "the total rate of recombinations is computed from this density profile assuming the halo gas has been fully ionized by the star , and is subtracted from the photon emission rate of the star .",

    "the escape fraction increases when reheating is considered , being more significant in low mass halos , which have their density profiles flattened .",
    "note that there is a halo mass at which the escape fraction falls to zero ; for halos above this mass , the single central star is not able to ionize all the halo gas and the region reaches a strmgren radius ( the assumption that all the halo gas is ionized is then obviously incorrect , but this affects the calculation of @xmath113 only when @xmath113 is already very small in any case ) .    the global emissivity from metal - free stars , @xmath123 , is finally calculated by integrating over all halo masses the number of photons emitted per igm particle corrected by absorption , i.e. , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the baryonic number density of the igm at @xmath61 , and @xmath126 is the probability that a halo harbors a main sequence metal - free star ( see eq .",

    "after the formation of the first metal - free star in any halo , the surrounding gas is polluted with the metals released by this star .",
    "the metal - enriched gas can recombine and fall back into the halo .",
    "we assume the metallicity of this infalling gas is then sufficiently high to cool by the usual mechanisms that are prevalent in present galaxies ( bromm et al .",
    "however , halos with metal - enriched gas below a critical virial temperature may still not form stars because the cooling rates are too small ( e.g. , dijkstra et al .",
    "2004b ) , and gas may remain close to @xmath131 k in a spherical or thick disk distribution where the gas is unable to cool further and fragment .",
    "in this paper , we adopt the simple assumption that in halos were metal - rich star formation takes place , the emissivity per unit baryonic mass is constant at all redshifts .",
    "then , the global emissivity due to enriched stars , @xmath132 , is calibrated to the observations of the ionizing background intensity and mean free path of ionizing photons at redshift @xmath0 ( see onken & miralda - escud 2004 ) : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the emissivity at redshift 4 in units of ionising photons per particle and per hubble time , @xmath135 is the fraction of mass in halos where metal - rich star formation takes place , and @xmath136 is the same fraction of mass at @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that halos with circular velocity above @xmath137 km / s are the ones forming stars at @xmath0 ( as in onken & miralda - escud 2004 ; this affects only the normalization of the emissivity ) , but consider different possibilities for the emissivity at higher redshift , as explained below .",
    "in order to study the effect of varying the emission from normal , metal - rich galaxies , we consider several models listed in table [ tcases ] .",
    "these models are labeled by a number , and in general any model will be referred to by the letter specifying the feedback processes assumed ( see table 1 ) and this number . in models 1 and 2 ,",
    "we compute @xmath135 as the fraction of mass in metal - enriched halos with a circular velocity greater than @xmath138 km / s , and in models 3 to 6 we assume that all halos that have been polluted by metals form enriched stars , with no minimum halo circular velocity .",
    "note that even by assuming a minimum halo circular velocity that is lower than at the calibration redshift @xmath0 , we are maximizing the emission at high redshift under the constraint that the emission per unit mass is not greater than in halos at @xmath0 .",
    "the value of the normalization constant @xmath134 is also subject to uncertainties arising from the process by which the intensity of the ionizing background is inferred from modelling the ly@xmath5  forest transmitted flux , and the measurement of the photon mean free path from the abundance of lyman limit systems .",
    "we adopt the values @xmath139 for models 1 to 4 ( as in miralda - escud  2003 ) , and twice this value , @xmath140 ( which would be favored by the measurement of the ionizing background intensity by bolton et al .",

    "in addition , there is some uncertainty in the physical processes governing feedback effects .",
    "for this reason , we play with the possibility to switch on or off the effect of photodissociating photons in order to check how important it is . finally , to compute @xmath135 in equation ( [ emisp12 ] ) we may consider or not halos with circular velocity @xmath149 km / s ( minihalos ) to see whether the value of @xmath7 experiences a big change .",

    "then , the reionization histories are reviewed (   [ sresreion ] ) .",

    "metal - free stars dominate at high redshift , and enriched stars start dominating below @xmath158 .",
    "this behaviour is easily understood .",
    "initially there are only metal - free stars and their contribution grows with time as more halos form .",
    "this results in an increasing fraction of halos being polluted with metals , which at some point causes a decline in the rate of new metal - free stars that are formed .",
    "the halos collapsing with enriched gas start forming enriched stars which eventually dominate the emissivity .",
    "the formation of metal - free stars is also reduced as redshift decreases due to the increased fraction of the igm that is ionized . in ionized regions ,",
    "the gas is less able to cool and low - mass halos would continue merging into more massive ones before forming any stars , implying a great reduction in the number of metal - free stars that can be formed .",
    "this effect is less important because the igm ionized fraction remains relatively low at the epoch where most metal - free stars form .",
    "comparing models 1 ( with metal - free stellar mass of @xmath159 ) with models 2 ( @xmath142 ) , figure 4 shows that the emissivity of metal - free stars increases by a factor of @xmath160 as expected at @xmath161 , but at lower redshift it increases by a smaller factor because the fraction of ionized igm increases faster for @xmath162 , reducing the formation of metal free stars to a greater extent than for models 1 .",
    "we note here that a high bias in the distribution of metal - free stars relative to the mass could further increase the effect of ionization in suppressing the number of metal - free stars that can be formed .",
    "we now examine how the inclusion of a photodissociating background , computed self - consistently from the star formation history , alters the results .",
    "figure 5 shows the evolution of the photodissociating background intensity in models b1 and b2 .",
    "the maximum is reached around @xmath8 as the effects of increased metal pollution and ionized igm fraction suppress new metal - free star formation ( note that emission from enriched stars is not included in this figure ) .",
    "figure 4 shows that the maximum of formation rate of metal - free stars occurs at higher redshift when the photodissociating feedback is included , because of the additional suppression of star formation .",
    "we also see in figure 2 how the formation of metal - free stars is shifted to higher mass halos in models a compared to models b at @xmath163 , because the negative feedback delays the formation of the stars to a later stage at which halos have grown to a higher mass .",
    "we consider two models for the soft x - ray energy produced by a metal - free star that is converted into igm heat , @xmath164 ( table 2 , models c and d ) . during the main - sequence , and at effective surface temperatures near @xmath165 k , the fraction of radiative energy emitted above @xmath166 is @xmath115 0.1% of the total energy output of the star , or @xmath167 erg .",
    "the supernova explosion at the end of the life of a metal - free star can produce as much as @xmath168 erg of kinetic energy for some stellar masses ( see , e.g. , bromm et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the fraction of these kinetic energy that is eventually reprocessed into soft x - rays may be @xmath169 ( oh & haiman  2003 ) , of which a fraction of 50% may be converted into igm heat when the soft x - rays are absorbed in a mostly neutral medium ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ) . given the substantial degree of uncertainty in the soft x - ray energy emitted per star , we consider the two values in models c and d bracketing our estimate .",
    "the increase in igm temperature caused by the absorption of soft x - rays is shown in figure 6 for models c1 and d1 .",
    "the onset of formation of metal - free stars causes a rise in temperature of the neutral medium starting at @xmath170 , and at lower redshift the temperature ceases to increase when the formation of metal - free stars is reduced ( in practice there would probably be an important contribution to the x - ray emission from the enriched population , which has been considered here ) .",
    "the establishment of an entropy floor causes a large reduction of the central density in low mass halos ( see fig .  1 ) , which greatly reduces the cooling rate .",
    "this implies that metal - free stars tend to be formed in models c and d in much more massive halos than in models a and b : the formation of these stars is suppressed in low - mass halos by the feedback effect , so metal - free stars are not formed until later when a more massive halo has formed from the mergers of several small ones ( see figure 2 ) . as long as our assumption that only one metal - free star forms in each halo continues to hold",
    ", the metal - free stars will be much less abundant .",
    "this is seen clearly in figure 4 , which shows the large reduction in the emissivity of metal - free stars caused by the soft x - ray heating .",

    "we see that , as expected , feedback delays the ionization of the igm .",
    "reionization always occurs gradually over a relatively wide redshift range .",
    "naturally , models with the highest stellar mass and emission from enriched stars achieve a higher ionized fraction at every redshift , and hence a higher optical depth . even though the total emissivity history may be double - peaked owing to the presence of the metal - free and the enriched populations of stars ( see fig .  4 )",
    ", there is never a double reionization because the recombination rate is slow enough that the ionized fraction continues to increase when the emission from metal - free stars starts decreasing .",
    "the redshift at which reionization is completed stays in the range of @xmath171 .",
    "this prediction of the redshift of the end of reionization is a natural consequence of the value of the emissivity assumed for the enriched stars that is derived from observations of ly@xmath5  absorption systems at @xmath172 , and of assuming that the clumping factor of ionized gas is not much larger than unity ( miralda - escud 2003 ) .",
    "the exact redshift of the end of reionization predicted by each model is not an independent test of our models , because this redshift can be modified and adjusted to agree with observations of the gunn - peterson trough in the highest redshift quasars ( white et al .",
    "2003 ) by introducing a moderate clumping factor with an adequate dependence on redshift ( note that we have assumed a clumping factor equal to one ) .    the values of the electron scattering optical depth for each model are presented in table 3 .",
    "the presence of metal - free stars has an important effect in creating a small ionized fraction at very high redshifts ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "however , the increase of the optical depth that metal - free stars can cause is modest and , even for @xmath174 and in the absence of any negative feedback effects , they do not increase the optical depth beyond @xmath175 . models d1 , d3 and d5 represent cases where the contribution from metal - free stars is minimal ( due to the very strong x - ray heating assumed ; see fig .  4 )",
    ". comparing them with models a2 , a4 and a6 where the emission from metal - free stars is maximum , we see that the early ionization caused by metal - free stars can cause only a relatively modest increase of the optical depth , under our central assumption that only one metal - free star is made per halo , and no metal - free stars are made in halos that have already merged with a halo in which star had previously formed .",
    "we have considered in this paper the maximum emissivity and the contribution to reionization that metal - free stars could make .",
    "our central assumption is that only one metal - free star is made in every halo where pristine gas is able to cool via molecular hydrogen rotovibrational lines .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption in view of the simulations that have been made of the formation of the first star and the effects of the subsequent ionizing radiation emitted and supernova explosion : the gas cools hydrostatically towards the center , avoiding fragmentation and forming a central star which can then ionize and heat all the gas in its host halo , and probably expel it in the supernova explosion ( e.g. , abel et al .  2002 ; bromm et al .  2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "once a star has exploded , it pollutes its host halo as well as every larger halo into which its host halo merges in the future .",
    "any halo that has already formed a metal - free star in any of its halo progenitors in the past is assumed to form a metal - enriched population of stars that has an emissivity of ionizing photons similar to the emissivity that is observationally determined at @xmath176 .    under this basic assumption",
    ", the contribution of the metal - free stars to reionization is relatively modest .",
    "metal - free stars may dominate the emissivity at very high redshifts ( @xmath177 ) , but before they can manage to ionize much of the universe , the metal pollution of halos rapidly reduces their formation rate",
    ". moreover , the effects of the ionization itself prevent cooling in the remaining low - mass halos with pristine gas , delaying the formation of a central metal - free star to the time of formation of more massive halos that collapse later , and thereby reducing the number of metal - free stars that are formed per unit of mass in the universe .",
    "reionization was likely completed by a population of stars and quasars in galaxies forming from pre - enriched gas .",
    "we have analyzed the effects of molecular photodissociation and of increasing the entropy floor by x - ray heating .",
    "these can further reduce the amount of ionizing radiation that is emitted by the population of metal - free stars . in agreement with oh &",
    "haiman ( 2003 ) , we have found that the negative feedback induced by x - ray heating can in principle be very large .",
    "however , as pointed out by kuhlen & madau ( 2005 ) , this negative feedback might be much less important than suggested by the simple calculation of oh & haiman ( 2003 ) and the one we have presented here . in our calculation , we consider only the cooling time of the gas at the halo center in the hydrostatic equilibrium configuration obtained at the end , by assuming an increased initial entropy produced by the x - ray heating .",
    "in reality , the gas should be able to gradually cool and lose entropy as it collapses in dense regions of halos , and these halos later merge to form the final one where a star is formed . the same x - rays that heat the gas would also increase the ionization , allowing faster molecular cooling as the gas density increases , which might greatly reduce the x - ray negative feedback effect .",
    "nevertheless , our main conclusion is that even without feedback effects the emission from metal - free stars is strongly limited by the metal - pollution and the ionization itself .",
    "our models are generally in agreement with previous work .",
    "the value of @xmath148 we infer is always lower than @xmath3 , even when we increase the emissivity of the enriched stellar population and we minimize any negative feedback effects on the metal - free population . for a smaller contribution from metal - free stars , values of @xmath148",
    "are closer to @xmath178 ( see table [ ttaue ] ) , in agreement with the results of ricotti & ostriker ( 2004 ) .",
    "our results are also compatible with those of sokasian et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who find that high cmb optical depths to electron scattering can be achieved only when many stars are assumed to be formed within halos that cool by molecular hydrogen .",
    "the model m9 of sokasian et al .  is the only one that assumes that only one star is formed per halo , and in this case their results for the maximum optical depth are in good agreement with ours .",
    "similarly , wise & abel ( 2005 ) can also produce high optical depths only by assuming that many metal - free stars form in each halo with a total mass much larger than in our model .",
    "naturally , if one is willing to assume a mass for metal - free stars even larger than @xmath179 , their contribution to the cmb optical depth , @xmath148 , can be further increased , but their total emission increases by a factor smaller than the increase in the mass because of the enhanced negative feedbacks . at the same time , if miniquasars emitting copious amounts of ionizing radiation where produced by the black holes created by the metal - free stars ( which could occur when a halo containing a central clump of cooling gas merges with another halo that has already formed a star and contains a black hole in its center ) , much more ionizing radiation could be produced , although the x - rays emitted by these mini - quasars might then be in conflict with limits on any unresolved component of the present soft x - ray background ( dijkstra et al .",
    "2004a ) .",
    "our work can also be used to estimate the contribution of metal - free stars to the cosmic infrared background , which might include the ultraviolet light of these stars from high redshift .",
    "the total number of ionizing photons that are ever emitted by metal - free stars can be computed straightforwardly by integrating the curves shown in figure 4 .",
    "the results are shown in table [ temis ] for each one of our models . even in the absence of negative feedbacks , and for stellar masses",
    "@xmath180 , metal - free stars do not emit more than @xmath115 one photon per baryon in the universe .",
    "this conclusion is not surprising , since in the absence of many recombinations one does not need a large number of ionizing photons to be emitted per baryon to complete the reionization . because of the very high effective temperatures of metal - free stars ( @xmath181 k ) , the number of photons emitted in ultraviolet light at wavelengths longer than the lyman limit is similar .",
    "hence , the contribution of metal - free stars to the present cosmic infrared background is not more than @xmath115 one photon per baryon under the assumptions we have made .",
    "recently , kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) detected brightness fluctuations in the cosmic infrared background after subtracting all contributions from known galaxies .",
    "the measured fluctuations are at a level of @xmath182 .",
    "this background intensity at a wavelength of @xmath183 corresponds to @xmath184 photons per baryon in the universe ; as discussed by kashlinsky et al .  , in order to account for the observed fluctuations the absolute brightness of the infrared background contributed by metal - free stars would have to be as high as @xmath185 ( or @xmath115 5000 photons emitted per baryon ) , after taking into account the expected high bias in the spatial distribution of these stars .",
    "it is clear that very extreme assumptions about the number of metal - free stars that were formed need to be made if the unaccounted fluctuations in the cosmic infrared background are related in any way to these metal - free stars . as discussed by santos et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , if metal - free stars are to make an important contribution to the cosmic infrared background , one needs to assume that a large fraction of all the gas in each halo where pristine gas cools by molecular hydrogen ( typically more than @xmath81 ) forms metal - free stars , and that most of the radiation from the stars is somehow internally absorbed in the halos in order to prevent an excessively early reionization of the igm .",
    "both of these requirements are not realistic : once a central star is formed in a @xmath186 halo , its ionizing radiation will ionize and push all the halo gas out over the short main - sequence lifetime of the star , and the escape fraction of the ionizing photons is high except in rare cases where a single star forms in a very massive halo ( see figure [ ffesc ] ) .",
    "the detected cosmic infrared background fluctuations have other more likely possible sources , such as an incomplete accounting of the faint - end of the galaxy luminosity function , or a normal population of low - luminosity galaxies with metal - enriched gas and stars at high redshift .",
