    "the search for earth - like planets has been underway from the ground since well before the _ kepler _ mission @xcite discovered thousands of extra - solar planets , including several earth - sized planets and smaller .",
    "one method used by ground - based observers enables the discovery of additional planets in systems with at least one transiting planet through high precision measurements of transit timing variations ( ttvs ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite show that an earth - mass planet in 2:1 resonance with a 3-day period transiting hot jupiter would cause timing variations of @xmath3 minutes , which would be accumulated over a year .",
    "ground - based half - meter class telescopes can be used to produce transit timing data with better than one minute precision for most planets with host stars brighter than @xmath4 .    to properly characterize a ttv signal , good phase coverage and a long baseline of measurements",
    "are needed . ideally , nearly all transits during the baseline period should be observed .",
    "this is of course nearly impossible from the ground due to the earth s rotation and weather .",
    "@xcite suggests that in most cases at least 50 consecutive transit observations are necessary to have a reasonable chance of characterizing the perturbing planet and its orbit .    even if a ttv curve is well sampled , it is notoriously difficult to uniquely infer the perturbing planet s mass and orbital parameters strictly from the ttv data @xcite .",
    "degeneracies exist in orbital period , eccentricity , and inclination .",
    "rv data , transit duration variations , or systems with multiple transiting planets can help to break the degeneracies .",
    "so far , no convincing ttvs have been reported from ground - based measurements .",
    "however , several authors have claimed evidence of low - amplitude periodic ttvs , followed by other authors with differing conclusions .",
    "for example , analysis of wasp-3b ttvs by multiple authors has produced differing conclusions .",
    "@xcite analyzed 13 wasp-3b transits and reported a sinusodal ttv with period @xmath5 d and peak value @xmath6 min .",
    "then @xcite found a lower significance in the ttv detection , but a possible detection of transit duration variations .",
    "@xcite studied 38 wasp-3b light curves and found no evidence of periodicity in the ttvs .",
    "small amplitude ttv claims are inconsistent across ground - based timing measurement analyses and , so far , no perturber planet has been confirmed from them .",
    "on the other hand , the almost continuous kepler light curves have demonstrated a number of clear ttv detections ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the kepler ttv data are responsible for the discovery of non - transiting planets and provide confirmation of the planetary nature of the transiting planet(s ) and estimates of their masses , without the necessity of rv data .",
    "@xcite searched six quarters of kepler data for planetary companions orbiting near hot jupiter planet candidates ( @xmath7 d ) by looking for multiple transiting planets and evidence of ttvs .",
    "special emphasis was given to companions between the 2:1 interior and exterior mean - motion resonances .",
    "they found no evidence for nearby companion planets to 63 hot jupiter candidates .",
    "however , five out of 31 warm jupiter systems ( @xmath8 d ) do show multiple transiting planets and/or evidence of ttvs .",
    "nevertheless , using k2 data @xcite , @xcite recently discovered two additional planets ( wasp-47c , wasp-47d ) transiting the ground - based discovered system hosting the hot - jupiter planet wasp-47b @xcite .",
    "the k2 data show wasp-47b transit timing variations with a period of @xmath9 d and peak variation of @xmath10 s.    wasp-12b and qatar-1b are transiting hot jupiters for which previous works have suggested the presence of transit timing variations ( ttvs ) indicative of additional bodies in these systems  an earth - mass planet in wasp-12 ( @xcite ; m13 ) and a brown - dwarf mass object in qatar-1 ( @xcite ; e13 ) . in this work ,",
    "we present high - precision photometric observations of 23 full wasp-12b and 18 full qatar-1b transits .",
    "we combine all transits from each system with spectroscopic and rv data from the literature and perform a global system fit for each system .",
    "the results provide refined system parameters for wasp-12b and qatar-1b and high - precision transit center times for each transit observation .",
    "we describe the wasp-12 and qatar-1 systems and the previous reports of ttv measurements in  [ sec : prev ] .",

    "wasp-12b is a hot jupiter exoplanet discovered by the wasp survey @xcite and announced by @xcite ( h09 ) .",
    "it orbits a @xmath11 evolved late - f star and has an orbital period of @xmath12  d , a semi - major axis of only 3.1 stellar radii , and a highly inflated radius @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite reported a faint ( @xmath14 ) elongated object @xmath15 from wasp-12 .",
    "@xcite confirmed the detection . using the keck telescope",
    ", @xcite resolved the neighboring object and confirmed it to be a binary composed of two m3v stars that are orbiting wasp-12 as part of a hierarchical triple star system .",
    "the projected separation of the binary from wasp-12 is @xmath16  au , corresponding to a period of several thousand years , so any influence on the orbital dynamics of wasp-12b should be negligible .",
    "qatar-1b is a hot jupiter exoplanet and is the first planet discovered by the qatar exoplanet survey @xcite .",
    "the planet was announced by @xcite ( a11 ) .",
    "the host star is a @xmath17 metal - rich k - dwarf star , and the planet has a circular orbital with period @xmath18  d , a semi - major axis of @xmath19 stellar radii , a mass @xmath20 and a radius @xmath21 .",
    "the short orbital periods of wasp-12b and qatar-1b result in relatively frequent opportunities to observe complete transit events from the ground , which has prompted other groups to conduct detailed studies of the systems .",
    "m13 acquired 61 partial or complete transit light curves from 2009 to 2012 from 14 telescopes distributed around the world .",
    "they classified 19 of the transits as high quality based on the rms of the model residuals and transit coverage of at least 75% .",
    "out of the 19 high quality transits , 11 have both ingress and egress coverage and baseline data before and after the transit .",
    "data reduction and differential photometry were performed using differing methods , depending on the originating observatory .",
    "detrending was implemented by fitting a second order polynomial and a fixed wasp-12b transit model from @xcite , which was based on one transit .",
    "m13 find tentative evidence for a transit timing variation ( ttv ) signal which has a period of @xmath22  d and a semi - amplitude of @xmath23  s , and they suggest that the possible perturbing body has a mass of @xmath24 and a 3.6 day eccentric orbit .",
    "@xcite ( c13 ) obtained harps - n in - transit high - precision radial velocities to measure the rossiter  mclaughlin ( rm ) effect in the qatar-1b system , and out - of - transit measurements to redetermine the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "they found that the orbit is consistent with circular and has a well - aligned spin - orbit angle of @xmath25 .",
    "e13 presented a detailed ttv analysis of 26 qatar-1b transits covering a baseline of 18 months and found evidence for a 190 or 380 day ttv signal with semi - amplitude @xmath26  min that could be reproduced by either a weak perturber in resonance with qatar-1b , or by a massive body in the brown dwarf regime .",
    "@xcite ( dm15 ) analyzed 12 complete qatar-1b transits and provided updated system parameters .",
    "after reviewing all ttv data available , dm15 suggest further and more precise data to determine if ttvs exist in the system . @xcite",
    "presented near - infrared secondary eclipse observations of qatar-1b thermal emission showing a mid - eclipse time consistent with a circular orbit .",
    "@xcite ( gm15 ) analyzed 18 qatar-1b transits to redetermine system parameters and found no evidence of periodic ttv s",
    "@xmath27  min .",
    "ttv analyses in the literature often suffer from a lack of control over the data collection and calibration processes .",
    "since transit observations are needed on many epochs for the detection and characterization of a ttv signal , researchers typically depend on multiple observatories to collect the time - series observations . with different instrumentation and operators at each observatory ,",
    "it is difficult to obtain homogeneously collected data .",
    "lack of control over guiding precision , other sources of systematics , time synchronization , exposure durations , defocus , calibration procedures , selection of comparison star ensembles , photometric aperture radii , and detrending methods may produce veiled inaccuracies in the derived system parameters .",
    "for these reasons , for this study we have opted to utilize observations obtained by us homogeneously with one consistent set of instruments and procedures , as we discuss in the following section .",
    "as part of our system analyses , we make use of radial velocity and stellar characterization data collected from the literature .",
    "the wasp-12b analysis includes sophie rv and rm data from h09 and @xcite , spectroscopic parameters @xmath28  k , @xmath29}}=0.3\\pm0.15 $ ] , and the nominal value of @xmath30 from h09 , and orbital eccentricity @xmath31 from @xcite and @xcite .",

    "many of the critical observational and data reduction methodologies that are discussed in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] can not be controlled when analyzing transit data from the literature .",
    "furthermore , many photometric time - series observations from the literature provide only partial transit coverage which limits the precision of the derived transit center time value .",
    "therefore , we do not include transit data from the literature in our analyses , but include only our new homogeneously derived full transit data sets to maximize transit timing precision .",
    "we observed 22 complete and one nearly complete high - precision transits of wasp-12b over the time span of november 2009 to february 2015 and 18 complete high - precision transits of qatar-1b over the time span of june 2011 to september 2014 .",
    "all observations were collected using the moore observatory ritchie - chretien ( morc ) 0.6 m telescope .",
    "the morc telescope was manufactured by rc optical systems and is operated by the university of louisville .",
    "the instrument features a very robust fork mounting with an absolute renishaw precision encoder on the polar axis that provides highly accurate free - running tracking of the sky .",
    "unguided exposures of up to @xmath35 minutes result in a tracking error of less than @xmath36 , depending on the altitude of the object .    an apogee u16 m ccd camera was used to collect the time - series observations .",
    "the camera has a kodak kaf-16803 ccd detector with a @xmath37 array of @xmath38 m microlensed pixels which oversample the seeing and facilitate high precision photometry over a wide dynamic range .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath39 per pixel , which provides a field of view of @xmath40 .",
    "the wide field of view helps to improve differential photometry by offering a wider selection of comparison stars .",
    "the oversampled seeing improves photometry by sampling the light from a point source with more pixels ( similar to telescope defocusing ) , improving the dynamic range of possible brightness measurements within an image , and reducing noise resulting from inter - pixel variations combined with imperfect guiding .",
    "the date , exposure time , number of exposures , filter , photometric precision , and the error scaling factor ( as determined by multi - exofast ; see  [ sec : globalfit ] ) of each time - series of observations are listed in tables [ tab : wasp12alltransits ] and [ tab : qatar1alltransits ] for wasp-12b and qatar-1b , respectively .",
    "all observations were guided from the science images and were defocused to improve photometric precision .",
    "we carefully synchronized our timing source ( see  [ sec : timing ] ) and converted to @xmath41 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "all exposure times were 100  s , resulting in a @xmath6 minute cadence .",
    "all wasp-12b observations were in the sloan @xmath42 filter , except for the @xmath43 observation on ut  2010 - 01 - 14 , the clear with blue block ( cbb ; a highpass filter with cutoff at @xmath44 nm ) observation on ut  2011 - 12 - 08 , and the @xmath45 observation on ut  2013 - 11 - 11 .",
    "the @xmath43 observation was the result of an error in the filter wheel controller .",
    "the cbb observation was an attempt to improve photometric precision , but it caused some of the brighter comparison stars to saturate or nearly saturate , so we reverted to @xmath42 as the nominal filter for the remaining wasp-12b observations .",
    "the @xmath45 filter was used because the @xmath42 filter was not installed in the filter wheel that night due to observations for another program .",
    "the first seven qatar-1b transits were observed with no filter ( i.e. open ) . after a cbb filter",
    "was acquired in late 2011 , it was used to observe the remaining 11 qatar-1b transits to reduce airmass trend in the photometric data .",
    "multi - exofast handles the observations in different filters seamlessly by extracting different limb darkening coefficients for each filter band ( see  [ sec : globalfit ] ) .",
    "all transit observations include coverage of pre - ingress baseline , ingress , flat bottom , egress , and post - egress baseline , except for the wasp-12b light curve on ut  2015 - 01 - 01 , which has no pre - ingress baseline or time of first contact coverage .",
    "a few of the transits have short gaps due to passing clouds or equipment problems .    .wasp-12 photometric observations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "figure [ fig : wasp12periodogram ] shows a lomb - scargle periodogram of our wasp-12b ttvs .",
    "all periodograms and associated false alarm probabilities in this work were calculated using the systemic console package , as described in @xcite , by loading the epoch values as the x - axis data set and the ttv values and uncertainties as the y - axis data set .",
    "all peaks are well below the analytical 10% false alarm probably ( fap ) indicated by the short - dashed line .",
    "nevertheless , we investigated the highest power peak at 3.6615 epochs ( 3.996 days ) , which is marked in figure [ fig : wasp12periodogram ] with a down - pointing arrow labeled 3.6615 .",
    "the phased plot and model are shown in figure [ fig : wasp12ttvsphased3p6615e ] .",
    "the 3.996 day period is close to 4.0 days , which suggests a systematic related to the earth s rotation , but we can not explain a specific possible cause .",
    "the sinusoidal fit has an improved @xmath46 compared to the linear fit .",
    "based on the difference in the two @xmath47 values and a difference of two degrees of freedom between the linear and sinusoidal fits , @xmath48 analysis suggests a 0.6% probability of a chance improvement in the sinusoidal fit .",
    "however , the @xmath49 day peak has an analytical false alarm probability of more than 100% .",
    "the semi - amplitude of the ttv signal is 34  s , which is nearly the same as the standard deviation of the ttvs and the mean timing uncertainty .",
    "our interpretation is that the ttv signal is the result of a night - to - night systematic or a chance fit to noise .",
    "the 500 epoch signal that was detected and investigated by m13 is marked in figure [ fig : wasp12periodogram ] with the down - pointing arrow labeled 500 and shows very little power in the periodogram calculated from our data .",
    "time domain searches around 500 epochs confirm the results of our periodogram .",
    "m13 included ttvs from an early follow - up light curve from the h09 discovery paper , and two more early light curves from c12 .",
    "figure [ fig : wasp12literaturettvslinear ] shows the ttvs analyzed by m13 with timing errors @xmath50  s ( square red symbols ) , after rephasing them to the linear ephemeris derived in this work ( solid gray line ) .",
    "the ttvs from this work are indicated by circular blue symbols .",
    "the transits at epochs @xmath51 and @xmath52 arrive significantly early relative to the ephemeris from this work , but not quite so early relative to the m13 linear ephemeris ( dashed gray line ) .",
    "combining all of the ttv data , a fit to the linear ephemerides gives @xmath53 ( ephemeris from this work ) and @xmath54 ( ephemeris from m13 ) . excluding the early epochs @xmath51 and @xmath52 gives @xmath55 ( this work ) and @xmath56 ( m13 ) .",
    "an even longer time baseline of observations may be required to determine which ephemeris best describes the wasp-12b orbital period .",
    "the periodogram of the combined ttvs was also investigated .",
    "again , there were no peaks with a reasonably low fap , and in particular , little support was found for the 500 epoch signal in either the frequency or time domain .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : qatar1periodogram ] shows the lomb - scargle periodogram of our qatar-1b ttv data .",
    "the down - pointing arrows labeled 133 and 267 ( epochs ) mark the @xmath57 and @xmath58  d periods investigated by e13 .",
    "we find no evidence for those or any other convincing periodic signals in the morc ttv data .",
    "gm15 reanalyzed light curves from e13 and c13 and combined the results with 18 new qatar-1b transits .",
    "we re - phase the gm15 transit center times based on the refined ephemeris from this work ( which is nearly identical to the gm15 ephemeris ; see table [ tab : qatar1comparison ] ) and plot the resulting ttvs ( square red symbols ) , along with the ttvs from this work ( circular blue symbols ) , in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : qatar1ttvslinear ] .",
    "with respect to the linear ephemeris model , @xmath59 for the combined data .",
    "it appears that the ttv uncertainties from gm15 are slightly overestimated , and that the linear model is a good representation of the combined data set , unless the uncertainties from this work and gm15 are significantly overestimated .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : qatar1periodogram ] shows the qatar-1b combined data lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "the significance of the strongest peak is even less than in the periodogram of our data alone .",
    "we find no support for periodic ttvs with semi - amplitude greater than @xmath2  sec in the qatar-1b system .    even for systems without astrophysical ttvs",
    ", if correlated noise systematics are dominant in the data , the ttv scatter from a linear ephemeris should be significantly higher than what would be expected based on the ttv uncertainties extracted by multi - exofast ( see  [ sec : globalfit ] ) .",
    "tables [ tab : wasp12ttvs ] and [ tab : qatar1ttvs ] show that the standard deviations of our ttvs for wasp-12b and qatar-1b , respectively , are only 6% larger than the mean of the @xmath60 ttv uncertainties .",
    "apparently , correlated noise is minimally impacting our extracted ttv uncertainties , so we expect the same , or even less , impact on the other extracted system parameter uncertainties .",
    "we present the results of self - consistent global fits to 23 wasp-12b light curves and 18 qatar-1b light curves ( that have all been homogeneously reduced starting from the individual images ) , rv and spectroscopic data from the literature , the @xcite stellar models , and the @xcite stellar limb darkening models .",
    "we reach space - like photometric precision of 183  ppm and 255  ppm for wasp-12b and qatar-1b , respectively , per five minute bin in the combined light curve model residuals .",
    "the wasp-12b derived system parameters in this work are consistent with values from the literature at a level of @xmath60 , except for the period of the linear ephemeris compared to m13 .",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 from this work are at the upper end of the @xmath60 range of the other studies , while @xmath66 and @xmath67 are at the lower end of the @xmath60 range .",
    "the qatar-1b system parameters derived in this work are consistent with values from the literature at a level of @xmath68 , except for the initial planetary mass underestimate by a11 .",
    "the values fall near the mean of the literature values , except @xmath69 from this work is at the upper end of @xmath60 relative to the literature values .",
    "the wasp-12b linear ephemeris from this work differs from the m13 ephemeris by @xmath70 , so a longer baseline of observations may be required to determine the precise ephemeris . or , if the two earliest ttv measurements shown in figure [ fig : wasp12literaturettvslinear ] are accurate , a long term ttv signal ( of about @xmath71  years ) may be causing the apparent changes in the shifting linear ephemeris .",
    "if the two measurements are found to be inaccurate and are removed from the analysis , the linear ephemeris from this work is a good fit to the combined high - precision timing data from m13 and this work .",
    "the @xmath72 uncertainty in the stellar models is not accounted for by multi - exofast , so no attempt has been made to correct for the @xmath73 underestimate of @xmath74 in the global model . because of this , our global model parameter values are directly comparable to those in the literature",
    ". we do not expect the unaccounted for stellar model uncertainties , nor the blended binary , to affect our ttv measurements .",
    "nevertheless , we aim to improve our global modeling capabilities to account for stellar model uncertainties in future works .    unless multi - exofast is overestimating the parameter errors ( which is unlikely given the error scaling values listed in table [ tab : wasp12alltransits ] ) ,",
    "the wasp-12b transit center times from this work are well modeled by a linear ephemeris with @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath78 , which has @xmath79 .",
    "a sinusoidal fit to the data using the period corresponding to the highest power peak in the periodogram ( 3.996 days ) , yields an improved fit with @xmath46 .",
    "however , that peak has an analytical false alarm probability of more than 100% .",
    "our interpretation is that the ttv signal is the result of a night - to - night systematic or a chance fit to noise .",
    "based on the reduced chi - squared value for the linear ephemeris model and the lack of signals in the periodogram , we find no convincing evidence for sinusoidal ttvs with a semi - amplitude of more than @xmath1  s in the wasp-12b data from this work alone or in combination with data from the literature .",
    "the qatar-1b transit center times are also well modeled by a linear ephemeris with @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath81 @xmath84 , which has @xmath85 .",
    "a lomb - scargle periodogram shows no periodic signals in the ttv data that have an analytical false alarm probability less than 100% .",

    "this interpretation is consistent with the conclusion by mg15 .",
    "the lack of significant ttvs in these systems is consistent with the @xcite study that found no evidence of ttvs in the orbits of kepler hot jupiter planets with @xmath86 days . on the other hand ,",
    "the data are sparsely sampled and it may be possible that short period , low level , or non - sinusoidal ttv signals are lurking in the data . in particular , the wasp-12b timing data between epochs 0 and 200 ( the 2012 - 2013 observing season ) seem to show a correlated downward trend .",
    "however , the data are too sparse to consider fitting non - sinusoidal ttv signals .",
    "finally , the results of our extensive new transit observations and systematic re - fitting of the global system parameters has resulted in updated parameters and uncertainties for the wasp-12b and qatar-1b systems .",
