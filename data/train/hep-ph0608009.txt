    "decays like @xmath4 are the exclusive counterparts of the famous flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays @xmath5 .",
    "it is well known that fcnc are absent in the standard model ( sm ) at the tree - level and further suppressed at the loop - level by the gim - mechanism .",
    "therefore they represent a sensitive probe for new physics ( np ) and are widely studied in the literature .",
    "moreover the weak transition involves the ckm - matrix elements @xmath6 .",
    "the decays are described in the language of effective hamiltonians @xmath7 where the wilson coefficients @xmath8 are matched to the sm or some beyond sm framework at the electroweak scale . as a next step",
    "the renormalization group is employed to evolve the coefficients down to a scale @xmath9 where the actual decay of the b - meson takes place .",
    "this procedure has been performed in qcd to nlo @xcite and the nnlo calculation are expected to be finished soon . as a final step the matrix elements of the operators @xmath10",
    "have to be taken , which is a notoriously difficult task due to bound - state effects .",
    "the matrix elements are parametrized in terms of form factors and it is the aim of this text to report on the reduction of the uncertainty of the relevant form factors in @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .    on the experimental side the mode",
    "@xmath11 has been measured as early as 1993 by cleo .",
    "its inclusive counterpart @xmath13 is in very good agreement with np calculations and gives stringent constraints on physics beyond the sm .",
    "the decay @xmath12 has recently been measured by belle @xcite and very recently by babar @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath14 transition reads @xmath15 @xmath16       +       ( -\\lambda_t^{(d ) } ) \\sum_{i=3 .. 8 } c_i o_i     \\big)\\ ] ] where @xmath17 are current - current operators , @xmath18 penguin operators and @xmath19 are the electric and magnetic dipole operators .",

    "these quantities are universal non - perturbative objects and describe the long - distance dynamics of the matrix elements , which is factorised from the perturbative short - distance interactions included in the hard - scattering kernels @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the amplitude reads @xmath35 \\ , a_7(k^*,\\rho )   \\underbrace { \\langle v \\gamma |   o_7 | b   \\rangle}_{\\sim",
    "t_1^{b \\to v}(0 ) } + o(1/m_b)\\ ] ] with @xmath36 .",
    "the most important @xmath24 corrections are due to the operator @xmath37 , which come with a numerically enhanced wilson coefficient @xmath38 .",
    "a further hierarchy is set by ckm factors , c.f .",
    "[ tbl1 ] , which implies that    [ tbl1 ]    for the @xmath39 transition solely the current - current operator with a @xmath40-quark pair is numerically relevant .",
    "this contribution has been estimated a long time ago @xcite and is considered to be under reasonable control . moreover , assuming three generations , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is known with a precision of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the major unknown quantity is the penguin form factor @xmath44 .",
    "the value quoted by the authors in @xmath45,@xcite compares well to an update of the form factors from light cone sum rules ( lcsr ) @xcite @xmath46 due to recent progress in the kaon distribution amplitude to be discussed below . for the @xmath47 transition things are more complicated because there also the current - current operators with an @xmath48-quark contribute which include annihilation contributions and an @xmath48-quark loop which has so far only been addressed by model dependent calculations , which makes the extraction of @xmath49 by itself difficult .    on the other hand , in the ratio of branching ratios @xmath50 \\quad , \\ ] ] the @xmath24-corrections @xmath51",
    "are somewhat accidently ckm - suppressed .",
    "the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 are almost exactly equal , so we set @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "non - factorizable contributions are unlikely to change this ratio significantly @xcite,@xcite . in order to compensate for relatively poor statistics an averaging",
    "is performed over isospin and we completely neglect the difference between the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 meson .",
    "then @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "the almost - equal sign indicates that other types of corrections are cabibbo - suppressed and the subscript is a reminder of the isospin averaging .",
    "the ckm factors are given by @xmath60 with @xmath61 being one angle of the unitarity triangle and @xmath62 one of its sides .",
    "the uncertainties are obtained by using @xmath63 , the value of @xmath64 has only a minor impact as compared to the former .",
    "the penguin form factor is defined by the following matrix element @xmath66 at zero momentum transfer @xmath67 . in reference",
    "@xcite this form factor was calculated using lcsr including radiative corrections up to next - to - leading twist .",
    "the uncertainty of the ratio @xmath68 we are aiming at , is considerably smaller than that of the individual form factors themselves as many uncertainties tend to cancel each other , e.g. the dependence on the @xmath69-quark mass and the normalization through the b - meson decay constant @xmath70 .",
    "the form factor ratio @xmath71 is basically a measure of @xmath72-breaking .    in reference",
    "@xcite we have further improved this calculation w.r.t .",
    "@xcite by including updated @xmath72-breaking in the twist-2 parameters , complete account of @xmath72-breaking in the twist 3 and 4 da and we have tested the sensitivity of the ratio to different models of da .",
    "it was found that solely the su(3 ) breaking of the leading twist-2 da has a major impact on the numerical value of @xmath71 and we will therefore shortly discuss its status .      the most important contribution to @xmath73 comes from the leading - twist transverse da @xmath74 and we refer to @xcite,@xcite for further details and references .",
    "the normalization of the transverse da can not be directly accessed by experiment unlike the longitudinal da .",
    "we therefore rely on theoretical calculations .",
    "the updated qcd sum rule calculations for these quantities are @xcite @xmath75 the uncertainties of these quantities are rather large by themselves as compared to the longitudinal decay constants @xmath76 the uncertainties in dominate the uncertainty in the final extraction of @xmath77 .",
    "lattice qcd @xcite has up to now only produced ratios of the longitudinal to transverse decay constants .",
    "the ratios of decay constants in sum rules @xcite and lattice - qcd calculations agree reasonably well .",
    "nevertheless further efforts in this direction would be highly desirable .",
    "the other important quantity for the tensor ratio is the first gegenbauer @xmath78 moment in the conformal expansion of the da , @xmath79 the first gegenbauer moment @xmath80 is zero for particles with a definite g - parity as the @xmath56-meson .",
    "moreover it is a measure for the average momentum of the strange quark as compared to the light quark in the kaon and it is therefore expected to be positive on intuitive grounds .",
    "a positive value was found in @xcite a long time ago , but when radiative corrections were evaluated and a sign mistake corrected , the value of @xmath80 became negative @xcite . in the following year two papers appeared @xcite,@xcite which criticized the instability of the non - diagonal sum rule used in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "one paper used an exact operator relation @xcite and the other one used stable diagonal sum rules @xcite .",
    "both analyses were completed in reference @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is found that the diagonal sum rules are numerically superior to the operator method and the final values for @xmath80 are ( at @xmath81 ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite @xmath82    with these values we obtained the following result @xcite @xmath83 where the total uncertainty of @xmath84 is obtained by adding the individual terms in quadrature .",
    "the belle collaboration has measured the quantity @xmath85 where @xmath86 is defined as the cp - average of @xmath87\\right\\},\\ ] ] and @xmath88 is the isospin- and cp - averaged branching ratio of the @xmath89 channels .",
    "hfag averages belle @xcite and babar @xcite results into @xcite @xmath90 this has to be compared to the theoretical prediction @xmath91 , \\\\\\ ] ] where in the annihilation contributions have been evaluated in lcsr as well as qcd factorization and although the individual results differ slightly it has an absolutely negligible effect on the value and the uncertainty of the ratio due to the accidental ckm - supression @xcite . equating we extract @xmath92 which is our final result .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result to two other determinations of @xmath77 .",
    "first in the sm the ratio is related to other ckm - parameters by unitarity and allows an estimate from the ckm - fit @xmath93 it is also interesting to note that for a typical lhcb uncertainty of the angle @xmath61 of about @xmath94 the above uncertainty would drop to about @xmath95 .",
    "moreover this determination can be compared to that from @xmath96-oscillations which have been measured by cdf ; they quote the following value @xcite @xmath97",
    "we have calculated the ratio of tensor form factors determining the decays @xmath1 as @xmath98 . its uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty of transversal decay constants .",
    "we then have calculated the isospin averaged ratio of branching ratios , including a preliminary estimate of power correction to be completed in @xcite . from this",
    "we have obtained @xmath99 .",
    "this value is consistent , within uncertainties , with the value from the ckm - fit and the value from @xmath96-oscillations and therefore does not indicate signs of np .",
    "it has to be mentioned that not only calculational uncertainties but also np could cancel in the ratios considered",
    ". therefore inspection of individual branching ratios is necessary and in particular an assessement of power corrections becomes indispensable @xcite .",
    "please note that in the arxiv version v1 we used the babar bound @xcite @xmath100 , which was combined , by hfag , with the belle measurement to @xmath101 and resulted in @xmath102 .",
    "these values have changed with the babar measurement  @xcite presented at ichep 2006 .",
    "the corresponding new results for @xmath3 is given in .",
