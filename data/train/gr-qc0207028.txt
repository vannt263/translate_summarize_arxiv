    "the response of a schwarzschild black hole as a gaussian wave packet impinges upon it consists of decaying quasinormal oscillations , dominating after time @xmath0 , and inverse power - low tails , dominating after time @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the black hole mass ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the quasinormal ringing can be caused by either external fields or by the formation of a black hole itself , and , the characteristic frequencies do not depend on a form of perturbations , giving us a `` footprint '' of a black hole .",
    "due to ads / cft correspondence @xcite the investigation of the quasinormal frequencies of ads black holes is appealing now : it gives the thermalization time scale for a field perturbation @xcite , namely , the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency , being inversely proportional to the damping time of a given mode , determines the relaxation time of a field .",
    "thus the more imaginary part of @xmath3 the faster a given field comes to an equilibrium .",
    "the investigation of the qn modes within the ads / cft correspondence was initiated on the ads gravity side by horowitz and habeny in @xcite for massless scalar field .",
    "then quasinormal modes associated with perturbations of different fields were considered in a lot of works @xcite- @xcite . an exact expression for the three - dimensional btz black hole qn",
    "modes corresponding to fields of different spin was obtained by cardoso and lemos in @xcite .",
    "recently the similar work for the btz black hole was done on the cft side @xcite .    on the ads gravity side",
    ", it was found that for the neutral massless scalar field in the background of rnads black hole with small charge , the more the black hole charge is , the quicker for its approach to thermal equilibrium in cft @xcite , and after the black hole charge approaches some critical value the situation changes on contrary @xcite .",
    "this repeats the behaviour of the usual r - n quasinormal spectrum , where the imaginary part of @xmath3 grows with the black hole charge up to some maximum , and then begin to decrease .    summarizing the results of the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", one can see that the late time radiative behaviour of a neutral scalar field for asymptotically flat ( r - n ) and asymptotically ( anti)-de - sitter ( rnds and rnads ) black hole space - times is essentially different : in the first case the inverse power - law tails are dominating , while in the second it is an exponential decay .",
    "this decay is oscillatory for rnads , and for rnds when a scalar field strongly coupled to curvature .    when collapsing a charged matter , a charged black hole forms .",
    "thus the evolution of a charged scalar field outside the r - n black hole is a most relevant .",
    "the late time behaviour of a charged scalar field was considered by s.hod and t.piran @xcite .",
    "there was shown that in the radiative tails the neutral perturbations decay faster than the charged ones and therefore dominate at very late times .",
    "in addition , while at timelike and null infinity inverse power - law tails appear , along the future black hole event horizon , an oscillatory behaviour accompanies this tail .",
    "thus there is a quite clear picture of asymptotic behaviour of the radiation corresponding to charged perturbations , while its behaviour during the stage of quasinormal ringing is lacking .",
    "this motivated us to study the behaviour of a complex ( charged ) scalar field during the quasinormal ringing through the computing of its resonant characteristic frequencies for r - n and r - n ads black holes .",
    "in sec.2 we shall compute the quasinormal frequencies of the r - n black hole for different multipole numbers @xmath4 , in sec.3 the case of the r - n - ads black hole is considered , and in sec.4 the dilaton black qn frequencies are obtained .",
    "we have found that the modes of the nearly extremal r - n black holes have the same damping times for charged and neutral perturbations .",
    "the possible connection of this fact with the critical collapse is discussed in sec.4 .",
    "we shall consider the evolution of the charged scalar perturbations field in the background of the reissner - nordstrom metric : @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "the wave equation of the complex scalar field has the form : @xmath7 here the electromagnetic potential @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a constant . after representation of the charged scalar field into",
    "spherical harmonics and some algebra the equation of motion takes the form @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "one can compute the quasinormal frequencies stipulated by the above potential by using the third order wkb formula of s.iyer and c.will @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are second and third order wkb correction terms depending on the potential @xmath16 and its derivatives in the maximum . here",
    "since @xmath18 depends on @xmath3 , the procedure of finding of the qn frequencies is the following : one fixes all the parameter of the qn frequency , namely , the multipole index @xmath4 , the overtone number @xmath19 , the black hole mass and charge @xmath2 and @xmath18 , and @xmath20 ; then one finds the value of @xmath21 at which @xmath16 attains a maximum as a numerical function of @xmath3 and substituting it into the formula ( [ 5 ] ) one finds , with the trial and error way , @xmath3 which satisfies the equation ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    ".the quasinormal frequencies for rn bh , @xmath22 @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( first line ) and @xmath25 ( second line ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in case of dilaton bh both real and imaginary parts of @xmath3 grow with increasing of either @xmath18 or @xmath20 .",
    "nevertheless the imaginary part of @xmath3 of the charged field does not approach that of the neutral one in the nearly extremal regime .",
    "one can see it on example of @xmath26 , @xmath23 modes where the wkb method gives reasonable accuracy .",
    "recently it has been obtained that at late times the neutral scalar field falls off faster than the charged field in the dilaton bh background @xcite .",
    "thus we see that for a dilaton black hole the situation changes on contrary as well : domination of a neutral field during the quasinormal ringing and of charged field at late times .",
    "we have learnt here that the damping time of the quasinormal oscillations associated with a charged scalar field in the background of the reissner - nordstrom black hole is less than that of a neutral one .",
    "thus that is the neutral perturbations which will dominate at later stages of quasinormal ringing . yet , we know that at late times the charged perturbations are dominating , and one could expect , possibly , that , the same sort of perturbations must dominate in the earlier stages of radiation .",
    "the logic of the process , however , is different . as was shown in @xcite , the late time behaviour of the charged scalar field is entirely determined by the flat space - time effects , while that of the neutral perturbations is depend on the relation between the `` tortoise '' @xmath27 coordinate and @xmath21 , i.e. by the space - time curvature . in other words ,",
    "the radiative tail of the charged field arises due to the backscattering of this field off the electromagnetic potential far away from the black hole , while in the case of the neutral fields it is the effects of gravitation near the black hole ( curvature effects ) . in this context",
    "it seems natural that in the earlier periods of radiation ( quasinormal ringing ) the curvature effects are dominating , and the neutral perturbations will damp slower .",
    "another interesting point of this study is the coincidence of the imaginary parts of @xmath3 for charged and neutral perturbations for the nearly extremal black hole .",
    "it leaps to the eyes at once that since the universal index appearing in the phenomena of critical collapse @xmath28 equals @xmath29 both for charged @xcite and neutral @xcite scalar fields , then there may be a connection between the behavior of the quasinormal spectrum of nearly extremal black holes and the critical exponent for a given black hole .",
    "yet the latter conjecture seems be too strong , and the black hole quasinormal modes may be related to the critical exponent in some specific space - time geometries @xcite,@xcite .    in this connection",
    "it is interesting to remind that the nearly extremal r - n black hole is effectively described by the @xmath30 black hole after spherically symmetric dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "for such a reduced nearly extremal black hole an exact relation between the quasinormal modes and the critical exponent is obtained in @xcite .    yet",
    "the coincidence of the damping times for charged and neutral modes of the neraly extremal black hole is , apparently , an exclusive property of rn bh , and is not appropriate to other black holes .",
    "it is possible , also that this coincidence takes place only for a massless scalar filed , since for a massive one the situation is qualitatively different @xcite    thus any kind of satisfactory explanation of the above coincidence from physical point of view is lacking .",
    "whether the damping times of charged and neutral perturbations in the nearly extremal limit will coincide for rnads bh , and , for an asymptotically non - flat black hole in general , is a question for further investigation .",
    "i wish to thank s.ulanov and a.gulov for invaluable discussions , and f.piazza for pointing out ref .",
