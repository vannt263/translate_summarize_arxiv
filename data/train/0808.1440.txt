    "the energy spectrum associated to charged particles moving in a two - dimensional lattice and subjected to a high magnetic field has inspired numerous works , since the seminal papers of hofstadter @xcite and wannier @xcite . when the magnetic flux penetrating the lattice is a rational number , namely @xmath0 where @xmath1 are integers , the spectrum splits into @xmath2 subbands .",
    "the representation of the spectrum as a function of the flux shows a recursive structure with clear self - similarities @xcite , and adopts the shape of an intriguing insect : the so - called hofstadter butterfly @xcite .",
    "the infinitely many gaps which compose this surprising figure are known to follow a simple rule : each gap is labeled by two integers @xmath3 which satisfy a diophantine equation @xcite . in a fundamental work ,",
    "_ have emphasized that the hofstadter butterfly plays a key role in the quantum hall effect theory : when the fermi energy of the system lies in a gap , the transverse conductivity of the system is quantized and is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the particle s charge , @xmath6 is planck s constant and @xmath7 satisfies the aforementioned diophantine equation @xcite .",
    "+ in this context , the green - kubo expression for the transverse conductivity has an elegant topological interpretation : when the fermi energy of the system lies in a gap , the transverse conductivity is given by a sum of chern numbers .",
    "the latter are associated with the filled bands that are situated below the gap @xcite . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the chern number is an integral invariant characterizing the topology of a fibre bundle which is defined on each energy band @xcite .",
    "moreover , these topological invariants are known to be the _ only _ quantized quantities which can be associated with the energy bands @xcite . the diophantine equation , which describes any 2d electronic systems subjected to a magnetic field @xcite , is highly connected to topology since both integers @xmath3 can be interpreted as chern numbers @xcite . as pointed out by macdonald and kunz ,",
    "the chern number @xmath8 measures the charge transported when the periodic potential is adiabatically displaced @xcite .",
    "+ recent advances in cold atoms physics @xcite allow for the experimental exploration of the hofstadter butterfly using atoms trapped in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "different arrangements , which indeed mimic the presence of an artificial ",
    "magnetic \" field in the dynamics of neutral particles @xcite , are nowadays studied in laboratories @xcite . with such setups",
    "one expect to explore new features in the fields of vortex physics @xcite and quantum hall systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have suggested that an integer quantum hall - like effect for neutral fermionic particles should be observed in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "+ recently , we have also shown that fermionic atoms trapped in 2d optical lattices and subjected to an artificial ",
    "magnetic \" field should undergo a mott metal - insulator transition and that the phase boundary depicts the hofstadter butterfly s _ outline _ @xcite .",
    "although the mott - insulator phase transition occurs in the system when the interaction between the particles is taken into account , the phase boundary only depends on the underlying single - particle physics .",
    "a similar result has been obtained by oktel _",
    "_ @xcite and by goldbaum _",
    "@xcite in the context of the bosonic superfluid - insulator transition .",
    "+ motivated by the important role played by the hofstadter butterfly s outline in this theoretical framework , and by the recent experimental advances in the field of ultracold atoms , we investigate intrinsic properties associated to this fractal and intriguing curve .",
    "we point out that the hofstadter butterfly s outline is also known to represent the phase boundary for the normal - superconducting phase transition in superconducting networks @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we characterize the hofstadter butterfly s outline by studying the chern numbers associated to the fundamental energy band of the system as a function of the magnetic flux .",
    "physically , we evaluate the system s transverse conductivity when the fermi energy lies in the first gap of the energy spectrum . under this condition",
    ", we show that the measure of the transverse conductivity exhibits a particular sequence of plateaus as a function of the magnetic flux .",
    "we study such structures and emphasize their universal character by comparing the results obtained for the square and for the honeycomb geometries .",
    "we first consider the case of a fermionic gas trapped in a 2d optical _ square _ lattice and subjected to an artificial  magnetic \" field @xcite .",
    "we assume that the optical potential created by the lasers is sufficiently strong in order to apply a tight - binding approximation and we investigate this system in the non - interacting limit , which can be reached at low densities .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath9 , which is characterized by the number of effective magnetic flux quanta per unit cell @xmath10 , is supposed to be induced by rotation @xcite , or by combining laser - assisted tunneling and lattice acceleration methods @xcite or by immersion of the lattice into a rotating bose - einstein condensate @xcite . for a rotating system , this parameter is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the angular velocity , @xmath13 is the particle s mass , @xmath14 is the lattice constant and @xmath15 is planck s constant @xcite .",
    "we can treat this problem by considering the landau gauge , @xmath16 , for which the many - body hamiltonian reads @xmath17 , with @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the fermionic annihilation ( creation ) operator on the lattice site @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the nearest - neighbor tunneling amplitude . in this work ,",
    "the effective magnetic flux @xmath10 is supposed to vary between @xmath23 $ ] , which is achieved for @xmath24 khz . in the following ,",
    "we set the lattice constant @xmath14 and the particle s mass @xmath13 to unity and work in units where @xmath25 except otherwise stated . for rational fluxes , @xmath0 where @xmath26 and @xmath2 are integers , the single - particle schrdinger equation yields the well - known harper equation @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a @xmath2-periodic wave function , @xmath29 is the wave vector and @xmath30 is the single particle energy .",
    "the wave vector belongs to the magnetic brillouin zone , a two - torus defined as @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the energy spectrum associated to eq .",
    "has a band structure , composed of @xmath2 subbands , which has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite : the representation of the energy as a function of the flux leads to the hofstadter butterfly ( fig.[square_but ] ) .",
    "this striking fractal figure , which illustrates the infinitely many gaps of the spectrum , exhibits a recursive structure and is described through a simple rule @xcite : for @xmath33 , the @xmath34 gap of the spectrum is labeled by two integers @xmath35 , which satisfy a diophantine equation @xcite @xmath36 in the square lattice case , the condition @xmath37 determines the solution unambiguously @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus our attention on the outline of the butterfly ( red curve in fig.[square_but ] ) , which is known to play a key role in the field of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "our aim is to investigate the structures characterizing this non - trivial curve , which is formed by the fundamental band @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , in the range @xmath40 $ ] . as @xmath2 increases",
    ", the butterfly s outline does nt seem to smoothen because of its fractal nature @xcite . in order to maintain the system along this irregular curve",
    ", we suppose that the fermi energy lies inside the first gap of the single particle spectrum for all @xmath41 $ ] . under this assumption , we are able to compute the analogue of the transverse conductivity for neutral currents @xcite , which is associated to the energy band @xmath42 for a given value of the flux @xmath10 . in this context , the transverse conductivity can be computed with kubo s formula and is expressed as @xcite    _ xy= _ ^2 - , [ cond3 ] where the fundamental state @xmath43 alone contributes .",
    "the quantization of this quantity follows from the topological interpretation of eq . :",
    "the transverse conductivity is related to the topologically invariant chern number @xmath44 @xcite , an integer defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the so - called berry s curvature associated to the band @xmath42 . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , one finds that @xmath47 , and therefore this invariant integer satisfies the diophantine equation eq . with @xmath48 ,    c_s=^-1 s_1 - , [ dio1 ] with the condition @xmath49 .",
    "+ one can solve eq .",
    "for all @xmath50 $ ] , in order to obtain the many chern numbers associated to the hofstadter butterfly s outline .",
    "technically one fixes a high value for the denominator @xmath2 and computes the chern number @xmath44 for @xmath51 , such that @xmath26 and @xmath2 are mutually primes .",
    "+ the illustration of these integers as a function of the effective magnetic flux is quite surprising . all along the irregular outline @xmath52 , the chern numbers computed for the various @xmath10 follow a very regular law : the representation of the chern numbers as a function of the flux @xmath53 depicts plateau sequences , adopting the shape of successive stairways . in fig.[two ] , we show this structure in a compact way , by plotting @xmath54 as a function of the flux @xmath10 .",
    "we note that this figure is symmetric with respect to @xmath55 .    the numerical result illustrated in fig .",
    "[ two ] is already interesting since it underlines the complexity of the hofstadter butterfly s outline .",
    "a topological argument stipulates that if the fundamental band @xmath56 is well separated from the first excited state @xmath57 , for all @xmath41 $ ] , then the chern number @xmath44 should remain constant @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the case since we have shown that this topological number takes many different values as the flux varies . for @xmath2 fixed and @xmath58 , we obtain that the number of different values @xmath59 increases linearly with respect to the denominator @xmath2 .",
    "we eventually note that the chern number s magnitude @xmath60 takes the value of all the natural numbers up to @xmath61 , namely @xmath62 , and that @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath2 may take an arbitrarily high value , our calculations show that the first gap closes infinitely many times as the flux is varied .",
    "these numerous gap closings are illustarted in fig .",
    "[ edges ] , where the two lowest energy bands are plotted as a function of the flux @xmath10 .",
    "+    furthermore , we find that a strong structure is hidden behind the intriguing fig.[two ] .",
    "we show that the other chern number which satisfies the diophantine equation with @xmath64 , s_1= + c_s , [ dio2 ] classifies the many points @xmath65 plotted in fig.[two ] in a rigorous manner .",
    "we illustrate this result in fig.[three ] , in which we connect all the points @xmath65 that are associated to the same number @xmath66 with a colored line . as @xmath66 increases , the color changes progressively from red to purple .",
    "it is very clear from this colored figure that all the plateaus belong to a specific stairway , labeled by @xmath66 , since no crossing between the lines is observed .",
    "moreover , we point out that the successive stairways correspond to increasing values of @xmath66 .",
    "we note that the integer @xmath67 is related to the quantized transverse conductivity , whereas the number @xmath68 actually measures the charge transported when the periodic potential is adiabatically displaced @xcite , + in summary , the first gap of the spectrum closes infinitely many times as the magnetic flux is varied .",
    "a signature of these gap closings is given by the chern number @xmath44 , which is associated to the first energy band , and which takes infinitely many different values as a function of the flux .",
    "surprisingly , these many values give rise to a structure consisting of successive stairways which are characterized by the number @xmath68 .",
    "in this section , we consider the case of a 2d _ honeycomb _ lattice subjected to a magnetic field .",
    "the honeycomb has a bipartite structure and it is common to define two fermion operators @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 ( see for exemple ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the unit vectors are chosen as @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in the tight - binding approximation",
    ", the many - body hamiltonian reads @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath0 is the effective magnetic flux quanta per unit cell . the single - particle schrdinger equation associated to eq .",
    "yields    @xmath76    where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are @xmath2-periodic wave functions , @xmath29 is the wave vector and @xmath30 is the single - particle energy .",
    "the wave vector belongs to the magnetic brillouin zone defined as @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the spectrum is depicted in fig.[honey_but ] as a function of the effective magnetic flux @xmath10 , and illustrates a modified version of the hofstadter butterfly .",
    "the band structure associated to eq . has been extensively studied in order to investigate the very rich physics of graphene @xcite .",
    "the chern numbers associated to the energy bands have been computed numerically by hatsugai _",
    "et al . _ and give rise to the anomalous quantum hall effect : around @xmath79 , the transverse conductivity evolves by steps according to @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an integer @xcite .",
    "the outline of the honeycomb butterfly ( red curve in fig.[honey_but ] ) is highly irregular and differs from the square lattice case in regards to its general shape . in order to characterize this other irregular curve , and compare it to the hofstadter butterfly s outline",
    ", one has to evaluate the chern numbers @xmath82 associated to the fundamental band @xmath83 for the honeycomb lattice case .",
    "unfortunately , contrary to the square lattice case , no diophantine equation is known to describe the entire honeycomb butterfly @xcite : the gaps are labeled by two integers @xmath3 which satisfy eq . , but the condition @xmath37 is not always satisfied .",
    "thus the chern numbers can not be unambiguously determined on the basis of the diophantine equation . in the lack of such an equation",
    ", one has to compute the chern numbers numerically .",
    "this can be easily achieved thanks to an efficient method developed by fukui _",
    "+ the numerical results are shown in fig.[honeychern ] . a new sequence of plateaus is observed in the honeycomb case , for which the transverse conductivity evolves by steps according to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is an integer .",
    "this is already surprising , because the fundamental band @xmath83 corresponds to energies which are far from @xmath79 , where the anomalous behavior of double steps is expected @xcite . from this observation",
    ", it seems that the main signature of the anomalous quantum hall effect is already contained in the edge of the butterfly : if the fermi energy of the system lies in the first gap while varying @xmath10 , one should observe this fascinating property proper to graphene . from a topological point of view , this particular sequence of chern numbers suggests that the honeycomb butterfly s outline radically differs from the hofstadter butterfly s outline .",
    "+ however , it is worth noticing that the general structure depicted in fig.[honeychern ] is remarkably similar to the results shown in fig.[two ] and fig.[three ] in the context of the square lattice case .",
    "the universality arising from these figures indicates that the diophantine equation also plays a key role in the honeycomb system . +",
    "although the condition @xmath84 is not fulfilled , we have verified that all the solutions @xmath85 satisfy the diophantine equation eq . , and that each stairway is again characterized by the other number @xmath66 .",
    "+ in order to emphasize the universality suggested by fig.[two ] and fig.[honeychern ] , we have connected with a colored line the solutions @xmath85 according to their associated number @xmath66 ( see fig.[honeychern ] ) . as in the square lattice case ,",
    "the successive stairways are indeed characterized by increasing values of the chern number @xmath66 .",
    "in this work , we have put forward the existence of strong and regular structures associated to the highly irregular hofstadter butterfly s outline .",
    "these structures , which arise in square and honeycomb lattices , have a universal character and are related to the underlying topology of the system s fundamental energy band .",
    "the topology of the system is designated through the chern number which gives its value to the quantized transverse conductivity .",
    "the correspondence between the results obtained for the square and the honeycomb lattices has been confirmed through numerical computations of the chern numbers in the honeycomb case .",
    "we have verified that these solutions indeed satisfy the general diophantine equation .",
    "it has been shown , for both geometries , that when the fermi energy remains in the first gap , the transverse conductivity is highly irregular but evolves on stairways labeled by the other number that satisfies the diophantine equation .",
    "we believe that these structures might play a role in the mott - insulator transitions observed in rotating atomic systems , where single - particle properties are known to be dominant .",
    "we eventually point out that the properties emphasized in this work are not restricted to the field of cold atoms physics and could also be found in superconducting networks or 2d electronic systems .",
