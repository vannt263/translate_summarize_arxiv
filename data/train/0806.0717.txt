    "the gauge sector of the standard model ( sm ) is symmetric under independent unitary transformations between the three family members of each fermion multiplet ( left - handed quarks and leptons , right - handed up- , down - quarks and charged leptons ) .",
    "the yukawa couplings between fermion fields and the scalar higgs field break the flavour symmetry , giving rise to fermion masses and quark mixing .",
    "new physics ( np ) models generically introduce new sources of flavour symmetry breaking , which are already highly constrained by precision data on b - meson and kaon decays . to account for this observation ,",
    "the concept of minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) has been proposed , which can be introduced in an elegant way by considering the yukawa matrices of the sm as vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of spurion fields @xcite ( for earlier , phenomenological definitions of mfv , see also @xcite ) .",
    "np effects can then be encoded in terms of higher - dimensional operators in an effective theory ( et ) , where all flavour coefficients are proportional to sm masses and mixing parameters .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have pointed out the particular role of the top quark in the et construction .",
    "being the only fermion in the sm with yukawa couplings of order 1 , the top quark breaks the flavour symmetry already at the cut - off scale @xmath4 of the et .",
    "therefore it is preferable to represent flavour symmetry in a non - linear way in terms of goldstone modes for broken flavour symmetry generators and spurion fields which transform under the residual symmetry .    at first glance",
    ", the lepton sector in the sm does not contain large yukawa couplings , and therefore the usual ( linear ) representation of lepton flavour symmetry could be applied to introduce minimal lepton flavour violation ( mlfv ) @xcite .",
    "however , in a scenario with minimal field content ( i.e.  potential right - handed neutrinos having been integrated out ) , the observed small neutrino masses have to be generated by higher - dimensional lepton - number ( ln ) violating operators ( see below ) .",
    "the small size of neutrino masses is naturally explained by the large scale @xmath5 associated to ln violation , while some of the flavour coefficients of ln - violating operators ( related to the largest eigenvalue in the neutrino mass matrix ) may still be of order 1 .    the physical picture that we have in mind is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ illustration ] : lepton number is assumed to be broken at a very high scale ( say , for instance , near the gut scale ) .",
    "for hierarchical neutrino masses , we assume the large atmospheric neutrino mass differences to be generated by a spurion vev at the scale @xmath6 ( for almost degenerate neutrino masses , the situation @xmath7 should be considered ) . the original lepton flavour symmetry @xmath8 is thus broken to a subgroup @xmath9 whose structure , as we will show , depends on the assumed neutrino mass pattern .",
    "the solar neutrino mass difference is related to the further breaking of @xmath9 which is assumed to happen at a lower scale @xmath10 .",
    "( in this picture , the scale @xmath11 related to the generation of yukawa couplings for charged leptons always obeys @xmath12 , but @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 are possible . ) at ( or slightly above ) the electroweak scale ( below @xmath16 and @xmath11 ) , the physics is described in terms of an et sharing the gauge symmetry of the sm , with the flavour structure of higher - dimensional operators being dictated by the vevs of spurion fields .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     which has a similar form as for the inverted hierarchy case , only the @xmath17 quantum numbers are replaced by @xmath18 ones .    as a final remark",
    ", we should also point out that the nmfv framework would allow for spurion fields that transform under both , the quark and the lepton - flavour symmetry group , and could be a remnant of lepto - quark interactions which typically appear in grand - unified theories .",
    "a detailed discussion of the potential consequences and phenomenological constraints is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "non - linear realizations of flavour symmetry are advantageous in cases where very distinct eigenvalues of yukawa or majorana mass matrices appear . for the quarks , it is the large yukawa coupling of the top which breaks the @xmath19 flavour symmetry down to @xmath20 , where the latter symmetry is only weakly broken by the remaining small yukawa couplings . in this paper",
    "we have used the same reasoning to discuss the flavour symmetries of leptons . here the hierarchy in the neutrino mass differences , @xmath21 , can be used to construct a parameterization of the effective majorana mass matrix ( entering the dim-5 operator in a scenario with only left - handed neutrinos ) which reflects the non - linear realization of lepton flavour symmetry .",
    "we have considered the various possible scenarios for neutrino - mass hierarchies , and for each case we have determined the residual symmetries , after the largest entries in the majorana mass matrix have been identified .",
    "the remaining entries are parameterized in terms of goldstone modes for the broken generators , and spurion fields which eventually break the residual flavour symmetry . based on the minimal flavour violation hypothesis",
    ", we may then construct the flavour structure of possible new physics operators which mediate e.g.  lepton - flavour violating decays of charged leptons . within the same framework , we have also considered possible parameterizations of `` next - to - minimal lepton flavour violation '' along the lines proposed in @xcite .",
    "besides offering a systematic model - independent framework to discuss deviations from the standard model in lepton - flavour violating processes , our approach also provides some new perspectives on the flavour puzzle within the standard model and beyond .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to note that the different possible realizations of mass hierarchies for neutrinos and charged leptons is unambiguously linked to different sequences of flavour symmetry breaking , @xmath22 ( a similar statement holds for the quark sector , which is going to be explored in a future publication ) .",
