    "the field of non - equilibrium quantum many - body dynamics has seen increasing interest and rapid progress in recent years . periodically - driven , or floquet ,",
    "many - body systems have been among the most rapidly progressing topics because of the promise of non - trivial long - time behaviour and the resulting recent experimental activity.@xcite    the main obstacle to observing interesting physics at long times in floquet matter is that a general ergodic system simply heats up maximally under driving , as its entropy increases due to the non - adiabatic nature of the perturbation.@xcite this process may be frustrated either by tuning to certain integrable points for which the system does not heat up and its long - time behaviour is described by a so - called `` periodic gibbs ensemble '' ( pge),@xcite or more robustly by introducing disorder which leads to a many - body localised ( mbl ) phase in static systems.@xcite driving an mbl system leads to finite - energy - density long - time states@xcite which may display non - equilibrium phases based on the notion of eigenstate order.@xcite    one particularly intriguing example is the @xmath0spin glass,@xcite since also known as discrete time crystal ( dtc ) @xcite . the @xmath1-dimensional spatiotemporal order characterising dtcs manifests itself as a subharmonic response of the system to the driving . like bragg peaks signalling an increased magnetic unit cell compared to the structural one upon the onset of antiferromagnetic nel order ,",
    "this is encoded in the temporal fourier transform .",
    "this prediction has immediately sparked activity aimed at the experimental confirmation of this latest addition to quantum statistical mechanics.@xcite the experiments found a temporally decaying order parameter .",
    "this immediately poses the question of the stability of the spatiotemporal order in realistic environmental conditions .",
    "in addition , in this setting there is the obvious question about the role of decoherence  a concept of perennial interest in quantum physics , playing a role in aspects as fundamental as the measurement process , and applications as important as quantum computing.@xcite    we address these issues by studying the evolution of the density matrix via a lindblad equation describing coupling to a markovian environment .",
    "we find that at least in the one dimensional disordered systems recently investigated , the spatiotemporal dtc order is destroyed by any realistic model of environmental effects .",
    "we investigate two generic models of environmental decoherence as well as a model of an external thermal bath , finding that while the latter still destroys the dtc it nevertheless does not lead to an infinite - temperature state .    in detail , our results are the following .",
    "first , we show that dtcs can be described , in the long time limit , by a form of the density matrix that we call block - diagonal ensemble ( bde ) , which has a block - diagonal form in a basis we define related to the floquet basis and which is manifestly @xmath2 periodic . for any local operator to be sensitive to this periodicity",
    ", disorder must be present and the initial states must themselves break the @xmath3 symmetry of the drive .",
    "we then discuss which properties lead to a lindblad - type equation which has this form as a steady state . because dtc is a property of the floquet states , not detectable by spatially and temporally local measurements , we are led to conclude that lindblad operators preserving dtc are most naturally expressed in the floquet basis and have the property either of not coupling different floquet states to each other at all , or of coupling floquet states only to others selected based on the local operator that displays oscillations .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that coupling to physical environments typically destroys dtc , since in general the environment will not have this property .",
    "thus while it is possible to write down lindblad operators preserving the dtc , these do not appear to correspond to any natural physical processes .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first review dtcs in isolated floquet systems in order to define the problem and fix notation .",
    "we then set up our analysis for the presence of dephasing non - unitary dynamics .",
    "we present our results on the timescales over which the dtcs persist as well as our general conclusions on the stability of the dtc in open one dimensional systems , based on an analysis of different types of coupling models to the environment . we conclude with an outlook .",
    "we set up the problem by taking the first and arguably simplest model of a dtc as our object of study . for a brief review see ref .  .",
    "the floquet dynamics is provided by a binary drive , in which the period @xmath5 is subdivided into two parts during each of which a time - independent hamiltonian generates unitary evolution : @xmath6 the model describing a chain of spins-1/2 represented by pauli matrices @xmath7",

    "however the numerically accessible range of @xmath18 can be quite small especially as our exact approach only allows for small system sizes for which a flip of a single spin s @xmath19 component with concomitant energy change @xmath18 can already amount to considerable energy `` density . ''",
    "the unitary operator @xmath20 propagates the system over one period .",
    "its eigenvectors @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the floquet states which for stroboscopic dynamics play a role analogous to that played by energy eigenstates for static systems .",

    "@xmath41 these two basis states are eigenstates neither of the parity operator @xmath42 nor of the unitary operator @xmath31 and have the following properties :    1 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath39 is generically finite in each of these . 2 .   from eq",

    "it follows that the action of the parity operator is to flip the spin : @xmath44 4 .",
    "from the two last points one concludes that the broken symmetry states break spatiotemporal symmetry , with a subharmonic response of period @xmath2 : if @xmath45 and @xmath46 for integer @xmath47 then @xmath48",
    "in this section we use the above properties to show that the long - time state of the system is well described by a density matrix of a special form that we call the `` block - diagonal ensemble '' ( bde ) .",
    "this form follows naturally from the doublet structure and the form of the matrix elements of operators breaking the @xmath3 symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : matrix - els - sigma - x ] ) and generalises the diagonal ensemble occuring in systems with no special spectral structure.@xcite    let us now consider the form of the bde matrix in detail .",

    "a ) the eigenvalues @xmath25 are continuously distributed with no special spectral structure apart from repelling each other due to the ergodic nature of the system and b ) local operators have matrix elements that are maximal near the diagonal @xmath52 , as for static systems.@xcite this leads to such operators having synchronised states which are described by the so - called diagonal ensemble@xcite in the floquet basis , in which terms with @xmath53 do not contribute at long times .",
    "the result is that the long - time steady - state becomes independent of the period @xmath50 , thus synchronised with the driving.@xcite    in the @xmath0sg case , by contrast , a ) the eigenvalues are continuously distributed _ except _ for the doublet pairing structure , and b ) there exist operators the matrix elements of which are appreciable between pairs of states separated by quasienergy @xmath54 .",
    "if the operators of interest possess the latter property , terms off - diagonal in the floquet basis and differing by quasienergy @xmath29 are the only ones that survive leading to what we call the `` block diagonal ensemble '' ( bde ) .",
    "density matrices of this form describe a steady state which is periodic with period twice that of the driving ( rather than with the same period as the driving ) .",
    "concretely , in terms of the broken - symmetry states a general initial density matrix may be written as @xmath55 which may be visually represented as @xmath56 with the matrices @xmath57 time evolved ( see eq .  ) this becomes @xmath58 , @xmath59 the expectation value of @xmath60 after @xmath50 periods is @xmath61 that is , time evolution affects parts of this sum corresponding to the diagonal blocks ( @xmath62 ) of the representation in eq .",
    "[ eq : full - density - matrix - pict ] only via a period-@xmath2 flipping of the pseudospin , while all the other blocks acquire an additional time - dependent phase .",
    "these phases are not correlated with each other , nor are they commensurate with the driving . noting that _ all _ diagonal blocks give a @xmath2-periodic contribution to the sum , while off - diagonal blocks also contribute a `` random '' frequency ( incommensurate with that of the driving and the other blocks ) , we conclude ( as earlier ) that the off - diagonal blocks may be set to zero in the long - time limit for the same reason the diagonal ensemble holds in the absence of the doublet structure .",
    "this then leads to the bde , @xmath63 visually represented as @xmath64    the action of @xmath31 on this is only to flip @xmath65 to @xmath66 , that is , @xmath67 hence , provided that @xmath68 or @xmath69 ( or both ) , a density matrix of the form eq .",

    "in particular , we note that the expectation value @xmath60 in the bde is @xmath72 from which it follows that _ the spin oscillates with period @xmath2 in the bde_.    for finite system sizes @xmath73 , the two partner states are not separated by quasienergy exactly @xmath29 but rather by @xmath74 with @xmath75 exponentially small in the system size , and different for each pair of states . after a time @xmath76 , which diverges in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the oscillations are therefore washed out and the dtc disappears.@xcite",

    "the lindblad operators that preserve dtc are naturally written down in terms of floquet operators .",
    "we will identify properties required for the dtc to survive and argue that these are unlikely to appear in real systems .",

    "( [ eq : bde - symbols ] ) : intra - block dynamics is only generated by the unitary term , which as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : description - in - terms - of - density - matrices ] results in the subharmonic features , while inter - block dynamics are only generated by the @xmath88 term .",
    "the time evolution due to the latter couples the diagonal blocks ( @xmath62 ) to each other and only to each other , while each off - diagonal block is not coupled ( @xmath53 ) to any other blocks so that each simply decays exponentially with time .",
    "we begin with a dtc - preserving choice for the lindblad operators of  , namely , @xmath89 so that @xmath90 is a projector onto a doublet . for this projector form @xmath91",
    "while for @xmath53 we have @xmath92 .",
    "therefore the entire time dependence is exponential damping of all off - diagonal blocks ( with rates determined by the various decoherence channels ) while the diagonal ones are completely unaffected by the evolution .",
    "consequently , any initial density matrix with pseudospin imbalance ( thus an initial finite expectation value of @xmath39 ) will result in a bde long - time density matrix displaying subharmonic oscillations .",
    "while we have succeeded in constructing lindblad operators leading to the bde form and subharmonic oscillations , we still need to discuss how realistic such a choice of operators is . to answer this , it is useful to think of the process described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lindblad ] ) as the system evolving unitarily , with the unitary evolution interrupted at random and with a typical rate set by the @xmath93 , by measurements described by the operators @xmath94.@xcite for the environment to have the effect described here it must effectively measure the occupancies of doublets .",
    "this is not a natural operation for two reasons : firstly , a measurement of a projector onto a doublet is impossible to achieve with local operations as it would require a simultaneous measurement at all points in space ; secondly , the projector is time - dependent , in a way dictated by the unitary time evolution of the floquet system itself .",
    "such an external environment therefore seems very fine - tuned and unlikely to appear naturally , even if it is not physically forbidden",
    ".      one may ask whether it is possible to remove the restriction of no mixing between the blocks and have dtc still survive . here",
    "we show that the answer is yes for certain fine - tuned choices of lindblad operators ; for general forms of the @xmath95 the dtc is destroyed .    to lighten the notation we use the fact that the off - diagonal blocks evolving according to eq .   simply decay exponentially , so the long - time bde state may be obtained by solving the equation @xmath96 +     \\sum_\\epsilon\\left (      { \\mathbf{\\hat{\\rho}}}_{\\omega_\\epsilon}\\gamma_{\\omega_\\alpha,\\omega_\\epsilon } -      { \\mathbf{\\hat{\\rho}}}_{\\omega_\\alpha}\\gamma_{\\omega_\\epsilon,\\omega_\\alpha }    \\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath97 ( see eq .  .",
    "as before , the unitary ( first ) term only produces intra - block dynamics by flipping the pseudospin periodically ; the interblock dynamics is described by a master equation for the @xmath98 .",
    "the steady state is determined by setting the sum on the right hand side to zero and is automatically of the bde form . for general @xmath93 that do not separate the state space into disjoint sets , such master equations generally result in a steady state in which all the blocks have a finite occupancy , with the occupancies determined by the details of the @xmath93 .",
    "this will in general result in vanishing expectation values for @xmath39 due to the fact that its expectation value varies randomly between blocks and is not correlated with the pseudospin ; this follows from the discussion around eq .   in section  [ sub : setup ] .",
    "we now discuss when this response might not vanish , finding that the conditions again correspond to environments with very unnatural properties .",
    "first , there will be a subharmonic response if the steady state corresponds to a single occupied block such that there is pseudospin imbalance .",
    "a single - block steady state will occur if the @xmath93 are such that there is a state into which there are transitions but out of which there are no transitions .",
    "this would require the effect of the environment to favour one particular floquet state over all others , corresponding again to an environment performing fine - tuned , time - dependent operations everywhere in space simultaneously .",
    "second , a subharmonic oscillation of the operator @xmath39 for a given @xmath99 will also result if the @xmath93 only connect blocks for which , for the same pseudospin orientation for each block , @xmath39 has the same sign . in this case",
    "the sign of the spin will flip in time , while its magnitude may decrease but will not vanish .",
    "however , for a finite fraction , say @xmath100 , of the spins to oscillate , the @xmath93 must only connect a fraction @xmath101 of the blocks which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus the environment would need to be selective in which states it couples , which is the same problem as in our earlier attempts to construct dtc - preserving operators .",
    "in addition this scheme suffers from all the drawbacks mentioned earlier , namely , that the environment would need to be performing finely - tuned time - dependent and non - local measurements on the system .        , the time over which the @xmath0rotation is effected , for sizes @xmath102 in blue , red respectively ( the data points coincide so the blue are not visible ) . here , @xmath103 and the data has been averaged over 100 ( 400 ) disorder realizations for @xmath104 .",
    "inset : same as left , but with @xmath105 kept constant ( by varying @xmath106 ) . the decay rate is constant , indicating that the decay rate is a function of the product @xmath105 only .",
    "this is consistent with the results of [ sec : analytical - approach ] .",

    "we now turn to the direct numerical solution of the lindblad equation for three commonly studied and physically realizable types of lindblad operators .",
    "two of them are dephasing operators , corresponding to generic interactions with the environment that destroy quantum coherence and have no particular energy structure .",
    "the third are `` thermal '' operators , which in the static case lead to thermal ( gibbs ) long - time states . in all three cases",
    "we find that dtc is destroyed , in agreement with the arguments of sec .",
    "[ subsec : lindblad - operators - and - bde - form ] , since these operators do not have the special structure required to preserve the bde form .",
    "in what follows we set @xmath14 and @xmath107 such that the average @xmath14 is @xmath108 with @xmath109 . in all cases",
    "we take as initial state an equal superposition of the ground and first excited states of an ising hamiltonian in the ferromagnetic phase , with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",

    "physically , they model the effect of an external environment that performs projective measurements of the spin in some direction .",
    "alternatively , they model environmental effects without a preferred energy scale .",
    "one example is the non - unitary dynamics generated by incoherent scattering of the lattice laser light in cold atom systems.@xcite    the two cases we study differ in that one preserves the parity of the initial state while the other does not ; however , as we will see , the dtc is destroyed in both cases .",

    "the two traces indicate different temperatures ( and the same bath - system strength coupling ) ; both cases results in a decay , leading to a broadening of the peak in the fourier transform shown in the right panel .",
    "in this work we have presented an analysis of the long - time periodic steady - state of floquet systems with nontrivial spectral structure .",
    "these systems include the @xmath4-spin glass , a.k.a.discrete time crystal , in which all states appear as members of a doublet separated by a fixed quasienergy , leading to a subharmonic response at a doubled period @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting long - time density matrix has the form of a block diagonal ensemble ( bde ) eq .",
    "( [ eq : bde - symbols ] ) , rather than the diagonal ensemble of systems with no special spectral structure .",
    "such a structure is necessary but not sufficient for the characteristic subharmonic oscillations that characterise dtcs ; a further requirement is the presence of spin order in the eigenstates , which in one dimension requires the presence of disorder .",
    "we have argued in general and supported with concrete numerical simulations that the subharmonic response is destroyed by any reasonable model of an environment , even if the symmetry underpinning the spectral doublets is not destroyed .",
    "this is a direct result of its reliance on disorder , for even static eigenstate order would be destroyed by the effect of broad - band environmental coupling .",
    "this holds true even if the external environment has a preferred energy scale ( temperature ) such that the system goes to a nontrivial long - time periodic steady state and preserves the symmetry , as for our `` thermal '' lindblad operators in sec .",
    "[ sec : fin - temp - bath ] , for which a steady state at finite energy density ( thus , not infinite temperature ) is obtained but nevertheless the dtc is destroyed .",
    "this study leads to a number of interesting further topics .",
    "the first is a detailed analysis of the dependence of these phenomena on gross system parameters  in particular , studying the influence of system dimensionality is a natural follow - on from recent studies of many - body localisation in higher dimension.@xcite this question is all the more pressing as one of the recent works studying the presence of time crystallinity was in fact undertaken on a three - dimensional system.@xcite this ties in naturally with a second major question , namely how one can hope to stabilise time - crystalline behaviour for a long `` intermediate '' time window , even if at asymptotically long times such order is completely lost . in particular , can one use the coupling to an environment to prolong , rather than curtail , the lifetime of subharmonic responses of the isolated system ?",
    "there clearly remains much scope for exciting discoveries in both theory and experiment .",
    "we thank g.  j.  sreejith and m.  heyl for discussions as well as a.  das , v.  khemani and s.  sondhi for collaboration on earlier work .",
    "we now explain how markovian non - unitary evolution can be described for open quantum systems via a lindblad master equation .",
    "as mentioned in the text , the lindblad equation ( [ eq : lindblad ] ) is the most general formulation of the differential time evolution of a system undergoing non - unitary markovian dynamics ; the operators @xmath73 describe the non - unitary part of the evolution and are completely arbitrary .",
    "its formal solution is @xmath158 one intuitive interpretation of this evolution is that the system evolves unitarily , while at random intervals undergoing a measurement induced by the operator @xmath159 .",
    "the result of the measurement is discarded , leaving the system in a mixed state , and the evolution continues . as we are taking the non - unitary evolution to be due to the interaction with some macroscopically large external environment , this interpretation is intuitively appealing .",
    "in general , the lindblad equation has at least one fixed point for which @xmath160 ; more generally , the fixed point is the eigenvector of @xmath161 corresponding to the eigenvalue with 0 real part . as we shall see below , the presence of symmetries ensures the existence of multiple fixed points .    finally , let us note that if all the @xmath162 are hermitian , @xmath163 then a fixed point is the identity @xmath139 .",
    "thus for hermitian lindblad operators typically the steady state is the fully - mixed , infinite temperature state @xmath139 .",
    "analogously to the heisenberg picture in unitary quantum mechanics , one may define the adjoint lindblad operator by its action on some observable @xmath164 as follows:@xcite @xmath165+\\sum_{a}\\left(l_{a}al_{a}^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left[l_{a}^{\\dagger}l_{a},a\\right]_{+}\\right)\\ ] ] the lindblad operator and its adjoint are related by @xmath166 from which it follows that the time - dependent expectation value is @xmath167    we now concentrate on the case where the hamiltonian commutes with some operator , taking for concreteness the parity operator , eq .  [ eq : parity ] . noticing that",
    "one may write the adjoint operator as @xmath168+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{a}\\left(l_{a}^{\\dagger}\\left[p , l_{a}\\right]+\\left[l_{a}^{\\dagger},p\\right]l_{a}\\right)\\label{eq : commutation - adjoint}\\ ] ] we immediately conclude that if @xmath169 $ ] for all @xmath170 then the expectation value of the operator @xmath42 is time independent ; it therefore remains a conserved quantity .",
    "as the operator @xmath42 has two possible values , this implies that there must be two fixed points .",
    "the lindblad equation is first order in time and linear in @xmath171 .",
    "this implies that its solution for a time - depenent @xmath172 can be obtained in a very similar way to that for the schrodinger equation . in particular , if the lindblad operators @xmath162 are time - independent and @xmath173 as in eq .",
    "[ eq : hising ] then the operator propagating @xmath171 over a period @xmath5 is @xmath174 with @xmath175+\\sum_{a}\\left(l_{a}\\rho    l_{a}^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left[l_{a}^{\\dagger}l_{a},\\rho\\right]_{+}\\right)$ ] for @xmath176 so that time evolution is generated by @xmath177 .",
    "this defines a quantum map .",
    "we note that @xmath178 need not be the exponential of a time - dependent lindblad operator .",
    "because of the special feature of this model that decay occurs only during the rotation phase when @xmath179 is acting , and because @xmath179 is a sum of single - spin terms , we can write down a single - spin simplified version of the problem which reproduces the observed dependence of the rates on the parameters .    during the part of the period over which the ferromagnetic term @xmath180 is acting and the system is evolving according to @xmath181 , the spins align along the @xmath114 direction . while so aligned , the dephasing term has no effect as any state with all spins ( anti)aligned with the @xmath114 axis is a steady state of @xmath181 with the lindblad operators of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dephasing - lindblad - x ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the paramagnetic term @xmath182 rotates the spin at position @xmath183 by @xmath184 which is on average @xmath4 ; thus the spins approximately flip .",
    "this flipping does not have to be exact , due to the action of the @xmath180 .",
    "however during the process of flipping each spin is obviously not in a steady state of @xmath185 so the dephasing term is effective .",
    "we now abstract this process into a single - spin evolving under single - spin versions of @xmath182 and the lindblad operators , taking @xmath186 and a dephasing lindblad operator @xmath187 with the density matrix evolving as in eq .",
    "[ eq : lindblad ] .",
    "we will use this to propagate our spin forward in time by @xmath188 , so that in the unitary case @xmath189 the spin s @xmath114 component would exactly flip .",
    "the density matrix can be decomposed as @xmath190 and eq .",
    "[ eq : lindblad ] results in @xmath191 the @xmath192 is constant , preserving the trace , while @xmath193 decays exponentially if it is not zero .",
    "the @xmath114 and @xmath194 components perform damped oscillations , as can be seen by writing @xmath195 and @xmath196 whence @xmath197 which is a damped harmonic oscillator : for @xmath198 or @xmath199 it is overdamped and the spin decays exponentially ( without any oscillations ) to @xmath200 . on the other hand , for @xmath201 or @xmath202 it is underdamped , decaying to the same point but oscillating on the way with frequency @xmath203 and decay constant @xmath93 ."
