    "quark matter at high baryon density is considered to have a rich phase structure in a way dependent on the physical conditions for color and flavor such as weak equilibrium and color neutrality . for the past few decades",
    "it has been predicted that cold quark matter is color superconducting when the baryon density is sufficiently high  @xcite .",
    "color superconductivity occurs in quark matter in a similar manner to ordinary superconductivity in metals ; any attractive force between quarks can bring about an instability of the fermi surface against cooper pairing , which subsequently leads to a bcs superfluid state characterized by condensation of quark cooper pairs and to a color version of the meissner effect through nonvanishing color charge carried by the pairs .",
    "in fact , the quark - quark force induced by one - gluon exchange is attractive in the color antisymmetric channel . at asymptotically high densities where",
    "the interactions are dominated by one - gluon exchange , this attractive force should drive cooper instability . more recently , effective model analyses , rather than rigorous qcd calculations , have predicted that quark matter is a color superconductor even at several times normal nuclear density and that the zero temperature pairing gap and thus the critical temperature are of order 10100@xmath9 .    in possible physical realizations in heavy ion collisions and neutron stars ,",
    "color superconducting quark matter might leave evidences for color superconductivity via precursory phenomena above the critical temperature  @xcite , neutrino emission from proto - neutron stars  @xcite , and neutron star cooling  @xcite , etc . to obtain such possible evidences , it is indispensable to clarify the equilibrium properties of color superconductors such as the equation of state and elementary excitations .",
    "this paper elaborates on collective excitations in quark matter , which might help us detect the onset of color superconductivity .    since quarks have more internal degrees of freedom than electrons by two ( color and flavor ) , various pairing patterns are possible among quarks , even within a state of @xmath10-wave , spin - singlet pairing .",
    "the ratio between the strange quark mass and the quark chemical potential is known to be a crucial parameter that determines the energetically favorable pairing pattern . in the case of three massless flavors",
    "the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase  @xcite is the ground state  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall focus only on the massless limit of cfl quark matter in which the baryon number conservation is spontaneously broken by the condensation of quark pairs .",
    "this can be mathematically formulated as global @xmath11 symmetry breaking , as we briefly recapitulate in sec .",
    "[ sec : cooper ] .",
    "superfluid @xmath12he , a typical laboratory fermion system that exhibits global @xmath3 symmetry breaking  @xcite , is similar to cfl quark matter in many respects .",
    "in fact , the ground state of liquid @xmath12he , i.e. , the b phase , has a condensate _",
    "isotropic _ in spin - orbit space , which is similar to the cfl phase in which the condensate is _ isotropic _ in color - flavor space . in both systems ,",
    "responses to rotation are characterized by a lattice of vortices  @xcite .    in the b phase of superfluid @xmath12he",
    "in which the pairing gap has no nodes , thermal quasiparticle excitations are suppressed at temperatures much lower than the gap . in this case , the thermodynamic properties such as the specific heat are presumably controlled by phonon excitations , nambu - goldstone bosons corresponding to fluctuations in the @xmath3 phase of the pairing gap , which appear in the low energy spectral function in the particle - particle channel .",
    "then , the same kind of phonons in cfl matter ( often denoted by @xmath4 ) are expected to play a key role in the thermodynamic properties at low temperatures  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the @xmath4 phonon spectrum in the energy range including the scale beyond the pairing gap @xmath1 in the random phase approximation of a nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model for cfl quark matter .",
    "this microscopic approach enables us to see that @xmath4 , if embedded in the quasiparticle continuum lying above @xmath13 , would decay into two quasiparticle quarks .",
    "we remark that an @xmath4 mode does not appear as a transverse mode , a feature responsible for a nonzero value of the superfluid baryon density at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "transverse excitations will be ignored in the present study , but play a role in breaking up phase coherence in the superfluid state and hence are relevant for responses to magnetic field and rotation  @xcite and for reduction in the transition temperature  @xcite .    in normal quark matter we also describe zero sound as fluctuations in the baryon density by analyzing the spectral function in the particle - hole ( vector ) channel in the random phase approximation in which collisions between quark quasiparticles are ignored ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for general arguments of relativistic zero sound ) .",
    "we extend the description of zero sound to the case of the cfl phase .",
    "we find that in the vector channel , zero sound manifests itself as an attenuated mode in the quasiparticle continuum lying above twice the gap , while @xmath4 dominates the spectrum below the continuum .",
    "we remark that for general excitation momenta the random phase approximation is strictly applicable to weakly coupled systems . in this respect ,",
    "a recent observation of zero sound in the lattice simulation based on a qcd - like model  @xcite is noteworthy .",
    "note that in the collisionless regime the restoring force of the collective modes is a self - consistent field formed by a number of particles , which would be disrupted by interparticle collisions if any .",
    "collective modes in the hydrodynamic regime such as first sound , of which the restoring force is provided by the collisions , will be addressed in our future study . for the study of low - lying collective modes in both regimes , the landau theory of fermi liquids",
    "is useful .",
    "this is the case with normal liquid @xmath12he  @xcite , superfluid @xmath12he  @xcite , and normal quark matter  @xcite .    in calculating the spectral functions in the cfl phase",
    ", it is important to take into account the mixing between the particle - particle and particle - hole channels .",
    "this is because such mixing plays a role in determining the spectral weight of @xmath4 and zero sound modes .",
    "we find that in the long wavelength limit the spectral function in the particle - hole channel vanishes due to the mixing effect .",
    "we summarize the main conclusions of this paper as follows :    * the velocity of the @xmath4 mode in the small momentum regime is @xmath14 at zero temperature . as the momentum goes up , the mode energy monotonically approaches @xmath13 , above which individual pair excitations are kinematically allowed .",
    "the velocity @xmath14 corresponds to the ratio of the spatial and temporal components of the decay constant @xmath6 .",
    "we find that the expression for @xmath6 in the njl model adopted here is the same as the qcd result in the mean - field approximation .",
    "* in the cfl phase zero sound appears as an attenuated mode in the quasiparticle continuum extending above @xmath13 .",
    "the attenuation width decreases with increasing momentum . * in the cfl phase , the spectral function in the vector channel is strongly suppressed at small momenta by the mixing with the particle - particle channel .",
    "* at finite temperature at which thermally excited quasiparticles are present , the @xmath4 mode has a finite decay width due to landau damping .",
    "correspondingly , a pure imaginary pole appears in the @xmath4 propagator .",
    "we estimate the thermal diffusion constant from the pole behavior in the complex energy plane .",
    "we note that the present work , which focuses on collective modes coupled with baryon density fluctuations in the cfl phase , is a complement to the work by gusynin and shovkovy  @xcite that gave a detailed account of collective modes coupled with color current fluctuations in the cfl phase .",

    "the energetically favored cooper pairing of quarks is antisymmetric in color space and has even parity and zero total angular momentum  @xcite .",

    "eight pion - like bosons associated with the breakdown of the axial part of chiral symmetry form an octet in @xmath27 just like @xmath28 in hadronic matter .",
    "one more massless boson arises as a color - flavor singlet from the spontaneous breaking of baryon number conservation in a manner that preserves local electric and color charge neutrality .",
    "this singlet boson is a phonon ( often referred to as @xmath4 ) corresponding to @xmath11 phase fluctuations of the condensate  ( [ eq : condensate ] ) .    for completeness ,",
    "let us consider the other phases which are predicted to appear in the phase diagram for neutral quark matter with nonzero strange quark mass  @xcite and confirm that all these phases do not have an @xmath4 mode .",
    "it is well known that in the 2sc phase in which only two colors and two flavors participate in pairing , there remains an unbroken baryon number symmetry associated with the unpaired color and flavor . in the same way",
    ", the usc and dsc phases in which only @xmath29 and @xmath30 pairing is breached as compared with the pairings in the cfl phase , respectively , preserve a modified @xmath11 symmetry .",
    "the usc phase , for instance , has finite condensates @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these two condensates are invariant simultaneously under rotations generated by an appropriate linear combination of the @xmath11 generator and two @xmath3 generators corresponding to flavor number conservation .",
    "therefore , there is no @xmath4 in the 2sc , usc , and dsc phases .",
    "put another way , in each of these phases , @xmath11 phase fluctuations in the order parameter are inevitably coupled with electric and color charge density since the condensates , as a whole , are not charge neutral in electricity and color .",
    "we note that in the cfl phase modified by quark masses different among flavors , @xmath4 modes could be affected by coupling with electric and color charge density . in this case , the quark system , if being color neutral and being neutralized and @xmath33-equilibrated by an electron gas , would generally have a superfluid part that is no longer charge neutral in electricity and/or color .",
    "this nonneutral superfluid part would occur not only at nonzero temperature , but also in the presence of gapless quark modes even at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "all the nambu - goldstone bosons in the cfl condensate  ( [ eq : condensate ] ) are color singlets because the corresponding fluctuations in the order parameter are not coupled with color charge density and thus are not eaten by the longitudinal component of color gauge fields through the anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "it follows that the cfl pions and @xmath4 consist of at least four and six quarks , respectively  @xcite , i.e. , they are composed of such combinations of particle - particle and hole - hole pairs as @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in this paper",
    "we assume that colored diquark condensates compensate color charge at the edges of the @xmath4 propagator as shown in fig .",

    "in this section we first describe the equilibrium properties of a normal fluid and a superfluid of quark matter with three massless flavors by utilizing an effective model with local four - quark interactions .",

    "we begin with a model for massless three - flavor quark matter . for the later purpose of describing collective excitations in the particle - particle ( @xmath4 ) and particle - hole ( vector ) channels ,",
    "it is convenient to deal with the lagrangian density having the diquark and vector interactions .",
    "one can generally obtain such interaction terms from any local four - quark interactions after appropriate fierz transformation .",
    "then the lagrangian density can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the quark chemical potential , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the diquark and vector interaction terms as will be specified below . as we will see later",

    "the corresponding baryon density is , as we will see later , approximately @xmath41 in our calculation where @xmath42 is the normal nuclear density , and may be relevant in the cores of compact stellar objects , although ideally symmetric cfl quark matter as considered here is only relevant at much higher densities where the strange quark mass is negligibly small compared with the quark chemical potential .",
    "note , however , that we have technical difficulty in taking an extremely large value of @xmath37 , because the effective model with the interaction terms that will be shown below is non - renormalizable and needs a finite cut - off parameter , @xmath43 .",
    "we shall choose @xmath44 in this paper .",
    "then , our choice , @xmath40 , can be considered effectively as the upper limit at which quark excitations around the fermi surface would hardly suffer from any cut - off artifact .",
    "we thus expect that our analysis of collective excitations with momenta up to @xmath45 is free from such artifact .    in this paper , for simplicity , we choose @xmath38 to be the interaction that occurs only in the color - flavor singlet diquark channel .",
    "this ansatz for @xmath38 makes no difference in the resulting gap equations as far as ideally symmetric cfl quark matter is concerned .",
    "the four - quark interactions thus take the following forms : @xmath46 with @xmath47 in which the sum is taken over @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is of the order of @xmath50 , but our qualitative results for elementary excitations are independent of a particular choice of @xmath49",
    ". hereafter we shall take @xmath51 for definiteness .",
    "a different @xmath49 provides a different ( dimensionless ) spectral weight in the vector channel , which is approximately scaled by @xmath49 unless @xmath49 is anomalously large .",
    "it should be emphasized that the vector interaction generally arises since chiral symmetry is intact ; @xmath39 is chirally symmetric itself . for specific values of @xmath49",
    "the phase diagram on the temperature versus chemical potential plane can have such intricate structures as to contain multiple critical end - points associated with diquark and chiral condensates  @xcite . since the density region of interest here is presumably beyond the chiral transition density , we simply ignore effects of chiral condensation .    as to the diquark interaction ,",
    "we shall fix @xmath50 in such a way that the solution to the self - consistency equations with @xmath51 yields @xmath52 with @xmath40 at zero temperature . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : zero ] , the properties of collective excitations in the cfl state change drastically according to whether they reside above or below @xmath13 , which corresponds to a threshold above which pair excitations are allowed to occur . as long as @xmath1 is much smaller than the quark chemical potential and much larger than the temperature , the energy and momentum of collective excitations are essentially scaled by @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", a single example presented here with the choice @xmath52 suffices for us to deduce what takes place for general values of @xmath1 .",
    "let us proceed to adopt the mean - field approximation by introducing variational variables , i.e. , the gap parameter , @xmath1 , and the quark number density , @xmath53 , as @xmath54 as we shall see , we obtain the self - consistency equations that determine these variables by substituting the mean - field quark propagator with @xmath1 and @xmath53 into the right side of eqs .",

    "equivalently , these self - consistency equations can be obtained from the stationary conditions on the mean - field thermodynamic potential with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath53 .",
