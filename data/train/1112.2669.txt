    "( for neutrino - neutrino scattering , certain statements in ref .   as to the indistinguishability of the different realizations presumably hold only in the strict low - energy limit , @xmath78 . )",
    "let us make two final comments .",
    "first , it is remarkable that all experimental facts of elementary particle physics known to date@xcite can be described precisely by the fermion and higgs multiplets of the minimal standard model if one allows for a single nonrenormalizable contact - interaction term in the action .",
    "these experimental facts include those from neutrino oscillations and perhaps those from neutrino - less double - beta decay . in principle ,",
    "even lorentz - violating effects could be incorporated .- type terms ( these derivatives are to be contracted with condensate vectors or tensors ) . ]",
    "second , the origin of the term may very well rely on an explanation which does not involve right - handed neutrinos or even grand unification .",
    "in fact , it could be that the apparent merging of the running @xmath5 gauge coupling constants at high energies ( @xmath79 ) would not signal the appearance of a unified gauge group , there would be no proton decay and no magnetic - monopole soliton solution ( for original references and brief reviews on both topics , see , e.g. , ref .  ) . ] but the onset of nonperturbative dynamics responsible for compositeness of the gauge bosons@xcite [ an alternative scenario relies on a lorentz - violating deformation of chiral gauge theory@xcite ]",
    ". a further consequence of these new underlying interactions might then be the appearance of an effective interaction term which violates @xmath0 , in addition to the @xmath59 violation inherent to the electroweak chiral gauge theory.@xcite in this way , the conservation of both baryon number @xmath80 and lepton number @xmath81 would be only approximate at low energies , because the fundamental fermionic constituents would not care about these quantum numbers .",
    "the @xmath5 gauge symmetry would be an emergent symmetry and the small neutrino mass scale would be a remnant of such a state of affairs .",
