    "the light - cone ( lc ) formalism @xcite provides a convenient framework for the relativistic description of hadrons in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom and for the application of pqcd to exclusive processes . among them , the @xmath0 mixing is a subject of considerable interest , which has been examined in many investigations , see e.g. experimental ones @xcite and theoretical ones @xcite .",
    "some experiments have been done recently , e.g. the new kloe value of @xmath9 } { \\gamma[\\phi\\to\\eta\\gamma]}=(4.9\\pm0.1_{stat}\\pm0.2_{syst } ) \\cdot 10^{-3}$ ] @xcite leads to @xmath10 @xcite ; the bes collaboration has announced a new measured value for @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 } { \\gamma[j/\\psi\\to\\eta\\gamma]}=4.94\\pm0.40 $ ] @xcite that leads to @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , the newly measurements of the form factors @xmath1 and @xmath14 at asymptotic region by babar collaboration @xcite , @xmath15  gev and @xmath16  gev , will provide further constraints to the theoretical predictions .    the pseudoscalar transition form factors @xmath1 and @xmath14 provide a good platform to study the @xmath6 and @xmath7 mixing effects , which have already been studied in literature by several groups @xcite .",
    "however in these calculations , either only the leading fock - state ( e.g. ref.@xcite ) or only the asymptotic behavior of the form factors ( e.g. ref.@xcite ) have been taken into consideration to determine the mixing angle .",
    "as has been pointed out in refs.@xcite , the mixing angle can not be reliably determined without a proper considering of the contributions from the non - valence quark states due to the fact that even though the higher fock states contributions are power suppressed in large @xmath17 region , they will give sizable contributions to small and intermediate regions .",
    "in fact , it has been pointed out in ref.@xcite that the leading fock state contributes to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 stands for the pseudoscalar mesons ) only half and the remaining half should be come from the higher fock states .",
    "the higher fock states contributions in small @xmath17 region can not be calculated by the perturbative qcd approach due to its nonperturbative feature .",
    "recently , ref.@xcite had constructed a phenomenological expression for the pion - photon transition form factor to estimate the contributions beyond the leading fock state based on its asymptotic behavior at @xmath20 and @xmath4 ( @xmath17 stands for the momentum transfer in the process ) .",
    "the predicted results for @xmath21 there agree well with the experimental data in the whole @xmath17 region . in the present paper",
    ", we will adopt this newly developed method to estimate the higher fock states contributions of the form factors @xmath22 and @xmath14 , and then to derive a possible range for the mixing angle by comparing the predicted results with the experimental data .",
    "as for the @xmath0 mixing , two mixing scheme are adopted in the literature , i.e. the octet - singlet mixing scheme and the quark - flavor mixing scheme .",
    "these two schemes can be related with a proper rotation of an ideal mixing angle ( @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "a dramatic simplification can be achieved by adopting the quark - flavor mixing scheme , especially , the decay constants in the quark - flavor basis simply follow the pattern of state mixing due to the ozi - rule @xcite . furthermore , by adopting the quark - flavor mixing scheme and also by carefully dealing with the higher fock states contributions , a naive discussion ( at the end of sec.ii.c ) shows that the value of @xmath24 decreases , while the value of @xmath25 increases , with the increment of the mixing angle @xmath26 , so a possible range for @xmath26 can be derived by comparing with the experimental data on the form factors @xmath22 and @xmath14 .",
    "and then by adopting the relation between the two schemes as shown in refs.@xcite , all the three mixing angles @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 involved in the octet - singlet scheme can be determined , where @xmath27 is mixing angle for the states and @xmath30 are mixing angles for the decay constants @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ". the theoretical and phenomenological considerations performed in refs.@xcite also favor the quark - flavor basis .",
    "therefore , we will adopt the quark - flavor mixing scheme to do our calculation through out the paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we outline our techniques for determining the @xmath0 mixing angle , where expressions of the pseudoscalar transition form factors beyond the leading fock state are provided . in sec.iii , we present the numerical results for the @xmath33 and @xmath34 transition form factors , and then derive a possible range for the mixing angle @xmath26 by comparing with the present experimental data on the form factors @xmath1 and @xmath14 . some discussions of the uncertainty sources for @xmath26 determination are provided in sec.iv . the final section is reserved for summary .",
    "in the quark - flavor basis , the two orthogonal basis states are assumed to have the following parton composition in a fock state description : @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) denote the lc wavefunctions of the corresponding parton states , and the dots stand for higher fock states .",
    "the physical meson states are related to the basis ( [ quarkflavor ] ) by an orthogonal transformation @xmath39 where @xmath26 is the mixing angle . under such scheme",
    ", the decay constants in the quark - flavor basis simply follow the pattern of state mixing due to the ozi - rule @xcite , i.e. @xmath40 , \\label{decayconstant}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the two basic decay constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 are defined as @xmath43 with @xmath44 the factorization scale that is of order @xmath45 .",

    "then the decay widths for @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be written as : @xmath56 where the two photon decay widths of @xmath6 and @xmath7 and their masses can be found in pdg @xcite @xmath57    from eq.([etagamma ] ) , we obtain the correlation between @xmath58 and @xmath26 : @xmath59^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath60^{-1 } .\\label{decayfs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it shows that if knowing the range of the mixing angle @xmath26 , the ranges of the decay constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be determined accordingly ; and vice versa .      in order to calculate the @xmath33 and @xmath34 transition form factors , we first give a brief review of the @xmath61 transition form factor @xmath21 .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of @xmath21 has been given in ref.@xcite , in which the transverse - momentum dependence in both the hard scattering amplitude and the lc wavefunction and the contributions beyond the leading fock state have been taken into consideration .",
    "especially , a phenomenological expression to estimate the contributions beyond the leading fock state has been constructed , which is based on the form factor s asymptotic behaviors at @xmath20 and @xmath4 .    as has been pointed out in ref.@xcite that the transverse - momentum dependence in both hard - scattering amplitude and the meson wavefunction should be kept to give a consistent analysis of the form factor .",
    "the revised lc harmonic oscillator model as suggested in ref.@xcite was employed for the lc wavefunction @xmath62 , which is constructed based on the brodsky - huang - lepage ( bhl ) prescription  @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , the lc wavefunction of @xmath63 can be written as @xmath64,\\ ] ] with the normalization constant @xmath65 , the harmonic scale @xmath66 and the light quark mass @xmath67 to be determined . since the contribution from the higher helicity states ( @xmath68 ) has little contribution in comparison to the usual helicity state ( @xmath69 ) ,",
    "so we only write the explicit term for the usual helicity state .",
    "the spin - space wavefunction @xmath70 for the usual helicity state of pion can be written as @xcite , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , one can derive a relation between @xmath67 and @xmath66 by adopting the constraints from @xmath73 and @xmath48 @xcite @xmath74    there are two basic type of contributions to @xmath21 @xcite , i.e. @xmath75 @xmath76 involves the direct annihilation of @xmath77-pair into two photons , which is the leading fock - state contribution that dominates the large @xmath17 contribution .",
    "@xmath78 involves the case of one photon coupling ` inside ' the lc wavefunction of @xmath79 meson , i.e. strong interactions occur between the photon interactions that is related to the higher fock states contributions .    by keeping the transverse - momentum dependence in both the hard scattering amplitude and the lc wavefunction",
