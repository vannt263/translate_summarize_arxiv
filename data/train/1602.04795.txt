    "in this paper we analyze the full compound asymptotics of solutions to the scalar wave equation on long - range non - trapping lorentzian scattering manifolds .",
    "this class of lorentzian scattering manifolds , introduced in  @xcite , includes short - range perturbations of the minkowski spacetimes as well as a broad class of rather different spacetimes that admit a compactification analogous to the spherical compactification of minkowski space . in this paper",
    "we extend these results to the more physically meaningful setting of _ long - range _ perturbations of gravitational type : this entails adding a term to our metric that involves a constant bondi mass .",
    "we analyze the compound asymptotics of scalar waves near the boundary at infinity .",
    "the most interesting region for this expansion is near the boundary of the light cone , where we obtain a full understanding of the asymptotics via an appropriately scaled blow - up ; the _ front face _ of this blow - up , i.e. , the new boundary face obtained by introduction of polar coordinates , is @xmath0 , the null infinity of our spacetime .",
    "we analyze the friedlander radiation field , which is given by the restriction of the rescaled solution to @xmath0 ; in particular we find as in  @xcite that the asymptotics of the radiation field in the `` time - delay '' parameter ( given by @xmath1 in minkowski space and subtler here owing to long - range effects ) are determined by the resonance poles of an associated laplace - like operator for an asymptotically hyperbolic metric on the `` cap '' in the sphere at infinity reached by forward limits of time - like geodesics . among the main differences of the construction here and that used for the short - range case in @xcite",
    "is the necessity of a change of @xmath2 structure on the compactified spacetime , prior to the radiation field blow - up , in order to construct the correct @xmath3    in particular , in the following theorem , the variable @xmath4 is analogous to the `` lapse function ''",
    "@xmath5 in euclidean space ; in the long - range case it is given instead by @xmath6 here the logarithmic correction has a coefficient , denoted @xmath7 related to the long - range asymptotics permitted in our spacetimes .",
    "the geometric hypotheses of the theorem are spelled out in detail in section  [ sec : long - range - scatt ] below , and indeed we will restate the theorem in a more precise fashion there .",
    "[ mainthm ] let @xmath8 be a non - trapping lorentzian scattering manifold , and let @xmath9 with @xmath10 @xmath11 assume that @xmath12 is a forward solution .",
    "then @xmath12 has a joint polyhomogeneous asymptotic expansion in @xmath13 @xmath14 if @xmath15 then only @xmath16 terms appear .",
    "the slightly eccentric - looking presentation of the terms in the sum is motivated by the fact that the variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 should be viewed as defining functions of the two faces of a manifold with corners obtained by the blowup of the light cone at infinity ( depicted on the right side of figure  [ fig : blowup ] ) .",
    "the exponents @xmath19 have an explicit description as resonance poles of a family of operators closely related to the spectral family of the laplacian on asymptotically hyperbolic space .",
    "the radiation field , which is conventionally defined @xcite by taking the @xmath4-derivative of the restriction to @xmath20 of @xmath21 is thus well defined and enjoys an asymptotic expansion as @xmath22 with terms ( given by taking @xmath23 in ) of the form @xmath24 note that because @xmath12 is a forward solution , @xmath12 is schwartz for @xmath25 when @xmath26 is small , hence the regime @xmath27 is the only interesting one .",
    "increases along @xmath0 towards @xmath28 . in the typical penrose diagram of minkowski space ,",
    "@xmath29 are collapsed to @xmath30 and @xmath31 is collapsed to @xmath32 . ]",
    "this theorem represents an improvement over the results of @xcite even in the case @xmath15 ( which was all that was treated in that paper ) , as the appearance of log terms in the expansion is considerably clarified .    in practice , the variables in are not well suited to the problem , as , for instance , the regime @xmath33 is the more interesting part of the parameter range . as in @xcite",
    "we will in fact view our spacetime as the interior of a _ compact _ manifold with boundary @xmath34 analogous to the radial compactification of minkowski space to the ball @xmath35 we will let @xmath36 denote the forward / backward light cones where they intersect the boundary at infinity , and let @xmath29 denote the interiors of @xmath37 interior to these light cones , i.e. , the future / past timelike infinity , which here is a smooth manifold with boundary @xmath38 then @xmath26 denotes a boundary defining function ( analogous to @xmath39 ) while @xmath40 will denote a function such that @xmath41 defines @xmath42 the future light cone at infinity .",
    "near @xmath43 , we can in fact simply change the @xmath26 variable to @xmath44 for simplicity .",
    "then _ in the short - range case _ ,",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 are the variables used above , while @xmath47 and @xmath48 will be defining functions for the boundary faces of the blow - up of @xmath49 and the compound asymptotics are thus expressed in these variables .",
    "note that @xmath50 while @xmath51 tends to @xmath52 as we move along @xmath0 to forward timelike infinity . in the long - range case treated here ,",
    "these definitions are seriously affected by the mass parameter , and the necessary changes are addressed extensively in section  [ sec : logification ] below .",
    "we use the notation @xmath53 to denote an element of @xmath54 and the notation @xmath55 to denote an element of @xmath56 .",
    "we use @xmath57 and @xmath58 similarly ( but with @xmath59 in place of @xmath2 ) .",
    "our convention is that the natural numbers include @xmath60 @xmath61      as the method of proof is in certain respects somewhat round - about , we sketch it here .",
    "the strategy mimics that developed by the authors for the short - range case in @xcite up to a certain point , where we prove conormality of the solution up to the boundary and to @xmath62 the subsequent treatment of the full asymptotic expansion is completely new , however , and much improves the earlier treatment even in the short - range case .",
    "the main steps in the proof are as follows :      as noted above , we will let @xmath26 be a boundary defining function for the boundary ( at infinity ! ) of @xmath63 ( e.g. , @xmath44 in the region of most interest ) while @xmath40 cuts out @xmath42 the future null cone ( e.g.  @xmath64 in minkowski space ) ; let @xmath65 denote the remaining variables ( analogous to @xmath66 when @xmath67 ) .",
    "we now consider the equation @xmath9 but then rescale and conjugate to a b - operator and makes it formally self - adjoint in the b - sense .",
    "it also removes the leading asymptotics of solutions of the wave equation .",
    "it is advantageous to work in the b - setting because the operator is degenerate in the sense of the scattering calculus , corresponding to its characteristic set over the boundary being singular at the zero section , the tip of the light cone in the fibers . ] to rewrite it as @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xmath70 this is advantageous because @xmath71 is then a `` b - differential operator '' in the sense of melrose @xcite , and enables us to employ the b - pseudodifferential calculus to obtain microlocal estimates on @xmath72 near @xmath73      we first prove a propagation of b - regularity , which is to say ( microlocalized ) conormality with respect to the boundary , starting at the backward null cone , where by hypothesis the solution is trivial ( zero near the boundary ) , along @xmath73 this works easily until we reach @xmath42 where the relevant bicharacteristic flow has radial points , and we need to use subtler estimates .",
    "the idea is that instead of proving conormality with respect to @xmath74 which is to say , iterated regularity under @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 we must settle for less : we only obtain regularity under vector fields that are additionally tangent to @xmath78 as well as to @xmath79 this is the content of proposition  [ prop : radial - b - estimate ] below .",
    "we also employ a refined version of the b - estimates described above that have a semiclassical parameter corresponding to the mellin dual of the vector field @xmath80      the propagation estimates are the necessary ingredient , following the strategy developed by the second author in @xcite , in showing that we may set up a global fredholm problem on @xmath81 for the family of `` reduced normal operators '' @xmath82 this is the family of operators given by an appropriate freezing of coefficients at @xmath83 and conjugating @xmath71 by the mellin transform in the boundary defining function ( which simply acts on @xmath71 by replacing the vector field @xmath84 by the parameter @xmath85 wherever it appears ) .",
    "crucially , @xmath86 is taken to act on spaces with varying degrees of regularity , with more regularity mandated at the backward ( in the sense of the time orientation ) end of the flow lines than at the forward end .",
    "the non - trapping hypothesis is used here in a crucial way to show that the family @xmath87 ( which we show always exists as a meromorphic operator family ) may moreover only have finitely many poles in a given horizontal strip in @xmath88 and satisfies polynomial estimates as @xmath89      we then begin the asymptotic development of @xmath72 ( and hence @xmath12 ) near the boundary as follows .",
    "cutting off near @xmath37 and mellin transforming , the equation @xmath90 becomes a family of equations of the form @xmath91 a priori , all we know is that @xmath92 is analytic in a half - space @xmath93 however we may invert @xmath86 to obtain _ meromorphy _ of @xmath94 with poles arising from the poles of @xmath95 if @xmath71 were in fact dilation - invariant near @xmath96 we would immediately have global meromorphy , but as error terms need to be dealt with at each stage , we are only able to improve our domain of meromorphy a little at a time , increasing the half - space in which we know meromorphy by finite increments in an iterative argument .",
    "this iteration does eventually yield global meromorphy , but with the subtlety that poles may arise not merely from the poles of @xmath97 itself but also from their shifts by @xmath98 for @xmath99    applying the inverse mellin transform has the effect of turning poles of @xmath100 into terms in an asymptotic expansion , with a pole at @xmath101 of degree @xmath102 becoming a term @xmath103 the coefficients of this expansion , however , are functions on @xmath104 that _ become worse _ in their regularity at @xmath43 as @xmath105 decreases , i.e.  as we obtain more decay in @xmath106 this development thus suffices to get an asymptotic expansion valid as @xmath107 for @xmath108 and indeed to get this expansion uniformly as @xmath109 near @xmath110 which is in effect one of the two asymptotic expansions at intersecting boundary faces in ( where @xmath47 and @xmath40 should be regarded as the defining functions for two intersecting boundary faces of a manifold with corners , where we seek a joint asymptotic expansion ) .",
    "it thus remains to obtain the full expansion , in both variables .",
    "it will suffice , via an argument discussed in section  [ sec : basics - b - geometry ] , to show that in the short - range case @xmath72 has improved asymptotics under applications of vector fields of the form @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the scaling vector field about @xmath62 in the long - range case , we must employ instead @xmath113 with the increased multiplicity corresponding to the additional log terms appearing in the long - range case .",
    "these extra difficulties arise because of a change of coordinates necessary to obtain good estimates at @xmath43 : if we ( locally ) replace the variable @xmath40 that defines @xmath43 with @xmath114 this change of variables has the considerable virtue of making the leading order form of @xmath71 near @xmath43 the same in the long- and short - range cases , but also the considerable defect of introducing additional log singularities into the coefficients of the remaining terms in @xmath115 it is these additional error terms that are responsible for the additional log singularities in our expansion .",
    "this change of variables and its consequences ( in particular , a change of @xmath2 structure on the manifold @xmath63 ) are discussed in section  [ sec : logification ] below .",
    "the main microlocal tool that we employ is the _ b - pseudodifferential calculus _ of melrose , together with refinements involving conormal regularity at submanifolds .",
    "we therefore begin by recalling notation and basic results about these objects .",
    "accordingly , the following preliminaries are essentially taken from @xcite . for a more thorough discussion of b - pseudodifferential operators and b - geometry , we refer the reader to chapter 4 of melrose  @xcite .    in this section and",
    "the following , we initially take @xmath63 to be a manifold with boundary with coordinates @xmath116 yielding a product decomposition @xmath117 of a collar neighborhood of @xmath118 in particular , for now we lump the @xmath40 variable in with the other boundary variables as it will not play a distinguished role .",
    "the space of _ b - vector fields _ , denoted @xmath119 is the vector space of vector fields on @xmath63 tangent to @xmath120 . in local coordinates @xmath121 near @xmath120",
    ", they are spanned over @xmath122 by the vector fields @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we note that @xmath123 is well - defined , independent of choices of coordinates , modulo @xmath125 ; one may call this the _ b - normal vector field _ to the boundary .",
    "one easily verifies that @xmath126 forms a lie algebra .",
    "the set of b - differential operators , @xmath127 , is the universal enveloping algebra of this lie algebra : it is the filtered algebra consisting of operators of the form @xmath128 ( locally near @xmath37 ) with the coefficients @xmath129 we further define a bi - filtered algebra by setting @xmath130    the b - pseudodifferential operators @xmath131 are the `` quantization '' of this lie algebra , formally consisting of operators of the form @xmath132 with @xmath133 a kohn  nirenberg symbol ( i.e. , a symbol smooth in all variables with an asymptotic expansion in decreasing powers of @xmath134 ) ; likewise we let @xmath135 and obtain a bi - graded algebra .",

    "in addition to the principal symbol , which specifies high - frequency asymptotics of an operator , we will employ the `` normal operator '' which measures the boundary asymptotics . for a b - differential operator given by ,",
    "this is simply the dilation - invariant operator given by freezing the coefficients of @xmath187 and @xmath188 at @xmath189 hence @xmath190    it is instructive in studying operators that are approximately dilation - invariant near @xmath37 to employ the mellin transform .",
    "thus we define the mellin transform of @xmath12 a distribution on @xmath63 ( suitably localized near the boundary ) by setting @xmath191 where @xmath192 is compactly supported and equal to @xmath193 near @xmath194    the mellin conjugate of the operator @xmath195 is known as the `` reduced normal operator '' and , if @xmath195 is given by , the reduced normal operator is simply the family ( in @xmath85 ) of operators on @xmath37 given by @xmath196 this construction can be extended to b - pseudodifferential operators , but we will only require it in the differential setting here .",
    "moreover , while the construction is more subtle if we extend our coefficient ring to @xmath197 as we would need to do to consider the dalembertian following the logarithmic coordinate change we will employ below , we will in practice only employ this construction in the setting of our original manifold with its smooth coordinates .",
    "the mellin transform is a useful tool in studying asymptotic expansions in powers of @xmath26 ( and @xmath198 ) . in particular , we recall from section 5.10 of @xcite that if @xmath12 is a distribution on our manifold with boundary @xmath34 we write @xmath199 iff @xmath12 is conormal to @xmath37 with @xmath200 where @xmath201 are smooth coefficients on @xmath202 here @xmath203 is an _ index set , _ which is required to satisfy the following properties in how the powers in the expansion relate to the @xmath204 variable in the index set . ] :    * @xmath205 * @xmath203 is discrete . *",

    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an account of why these conditions are natural ones to impose .",
    "when @xmath213 denotes an index set , this means the smallest index set containing @xmath214 i.e. , @xmath215    we now remark that we may characterize distributions in @xmath216 in two different ways : by mellin transform , or by applying scaling vector fields .",
    "to see the former , we recall that by proposition  5.27 of @xcite , we have @xmath217 iff its mellin transform @xmath218 is meromorphic , with poles of order @xmath102 only at points @xmath204 such that @xmath219 as well as satisfying appropriate decay estimates in @xmath220 ( we will state a quantitative @xmath221 version of this result below , hence will not discuss the estimates here . )",
    "alternatively , we recall that we may test for polyhomogeneity by use of _ radial vector fields _ : let @xmath222 denote the vector field @xmath84 ( recalling that @xmath223 has a factor of @xmath224 built into it ) .",
    "we can characterize @xmath217 for @xmath225 by the requirement that for all @xmath226 there exists @xmath227 with @xmath228 as @xmath229 such that @xmath230 ( note that by our index set conventions , the product includes @xmath231 factors of @xmath232 if @xmath233 since @xmath234 are in @xmath203 as well . )",
    "theorem  [ mainthm ] is about polyhomogeneity not just to one but to _ two _ boundary hypersurfaces of a manifold with codimension - two corners given by blow - up of our original spacetime @xmath63 at @xmath62 we thus make a few remarks here on the generalization of the theory of polyhomogeneity to this context ; it is covered in some detail in section  5.10 of @xcite , but that treatment only deals with the case where all but one of the index sets are the set @xmath235 of indices for smooth functions .",
