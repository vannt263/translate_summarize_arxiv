    "foremost among these is that observations of spectral lines formed at different heights in the solar atmosphere are needed to constrain the magnetic field geometry in three dimensions .",
    "secondly , simultaneous observation of multiple spectral lines and the application of a line - ratio technique have been shown to greatly enhance the diagnostic potential of zeeman - effect observations @xcite . finally , improving technologies ( e.g. ir detector arrays )",
    "have made it possible to take advantage of the increased sensitivity of the zeeman effect with wavelength through the observation of infrared spectral lines @xcite .",
    "it follows that the next generation of stokes polarimeters must have the capability to observe the solar atmosphere in a variety of spectral lines over a wide wavelength range , coupled with the ability to observe several lines simultaneously .",
    "this is reflected in the design of the recently completed spectro - polarimeter for infrared and optical regions ( spinor , @xcite ) , installed at the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) of the national solar observatory on sacramento peak ( nso / sp , sunspot , nm ) , that can observe between 430 and 1600 nm .",

    "the proposed science for the planned 4-m european solar telescope @xcite emphasizes multi - wavelength observations from the uv to the near - ir .",
    "one immediate instrument requirement stemming from this need for wavelength diversity is that the polarization modulation scheme must be _ efficient _ at all wavelengths of interest .",
    "typically , one attempts to achieve this goal by achromatizing the polarimetric response of a modulator .",
    "this , for instance , is the rational behind the design of super - achromatic waveplates @xcite . in this paper , instead , we present a new paradigm for the design of efficient polarization modulators that are not achromatic in the above sense , since they have polarimetric properties that vary with wavelength .",
    "however , they do so in such a way that they can be operated over a wide wavelength range with near optimal polarimetric efficiency .",
    "we refer to these modulators as _ polychromatic_. because of their performance , these are directly applicable to the next generation of multi - line stokes polarimeters . in the next section , we summarize the basic theory behind polarization modulators .",
    "next , we present example designs using existing technologies , including a discussion of the method used to obtain them .",
    "finally , the performance properties of a prototype polychromatic modulator are presented .",
    "most polarimeters operate by employing retarders and polarizers in a configuration that encodes polarization information into a modulated intensity signal .",
    "this intensity modulation is measured with a detector and analyzed to infer the input polarization state .",
    "an extensive treatment of the theoretical operation of stokes polarimeters has been given in @xcite .",
    "this work draws extensively from that formalism .",
    "the complete polarization state of an input light beam can be described by the stokes vector : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the intensity , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the net linear polarizations measured in two coordinate frames that are rotated by @xmath4 with respect to each other , and @xmath5 is the net circular polarization .",
    "since the stokes vector contains four unknown parameters , any polarimeter must make a minimum of four measurements to determine it .",
    "the polarization properties of a polarimeter in any state can be conveniently described by a 4@xmath64 mueller matrix in the usual way .",
    "the first row of any mueller matrix captures the transformation of a stokes vector into intensity . assuming that the detector is sensitive to intensity alone",
    ", then only the first row of the polarimeter mueller matrix is important .",
    "the modulation of intensity by a @xmath7-state polarimeter is captured in the @xmath84 modulation matrix , @xmath9 . for each state , the corresponding row of the modulation matrix ( the _ modulation vector _ )",
    "is given by the first row of the mueller matrix of the polarimeter in that state .",
    "the modulation matrix is generally normalized by the @xmath10 element .",
    "note that , for a retarder - based modulator , the first element of the modulation vector is the same in all modulation states , so after normalization the first column of the modulation matrix is all made of 1s .",
    "the operation of a polarimeter can then be represented by : @xmath11 and the input stokes vector is obtained by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the demodulation matrix . in @xcite it is shown that , for a given modulation matrix , @xmath9 , the optimal demodulation matrix is @xmath14 .",
    "the polarimetric efficiency of a modulation scheme can be derived from the demodulation matrix itself , and is given by @xcite : @xmath15 where the subscript @xmath16 varies over the four elements of the stokes vector .",
    "the polarimetric efficiency is important in that it quantifies the noise propagation through the demodulation process .",
    "the noise in the @xmath16-th element of the inferred stokes vector , @xmath17 , depends directly on the efficiency as @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the uncertainty on the measured intensity , assumed constant , during the measurement cycle .",
    "equation 5 implies that an efficient polarization modulator is required to measure a stokes vector with high precision .",
    "the efficiency on any stokes parameter can be between 0 and 1 , subject to the two independent constraints @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "many so - called magnetographs are designed to modulate only stokes @xmath5 with high efficiency . in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with modulation schemes that are balanced , in the sense that the efficiencies of stokes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 are equal . in this case , the maximum ( i.e. , optimal ) modulation efficiency for stokes @xmath1 is 1 , and for stokes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 , is @xmath22 .",

    "these may require different numbers of modulation states to achieve the full measurement of the stokes vector .",
    "in table  [ tab : monochrome ] , we present examples of optimally efficient and balanced modulators at a single wavelength , employing three different modulator technologies .",
    "these are a rotating waveplate of fixed retardation , a pair of liquid crystal variable retarders ( lcvrs ) with variable retardation and fixed orientation of the fast axis ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a pair of ferroelectric liquid crystals ( flcs ) with fixed retardance but variable orientation of the fast axis . the particular solution presented here for the flc modulator",
    "is implemented in the diffraction - limited spectro - polarimeter ( dlsp , @xcite ) , which is also installed at the nso / sp dst .",
    "an example of a flc modulator that is optimally efficient but with higher efficiency for circular polarization is given in @xcite .",
    "the lcvr modulator presented here uses 6 modulation states , although it is possible to create a lcvr modulator that is balanced and optimally efficient at one wavelength requiring only 4 states .",
    "we also note that a single lcvr can not modulate all stokes parameters , regardless of the number of modulation states .",
    "modulation efficiency curves for the four stokes parameters between 400 and 1100 nm for modulators with two flcs .",

    "_ dashed curve _ : polychromatic solution obtained from the former solution through the addition of a fixed quartz retarder between the two flcs .",
    "this solution was optimized between 500 and 900 nm ( indicated by the two outmost arrows ) .",
    "the horizontal solid lines in the four panels indicate the maximum theoretical modulation efficiencies that can be achieved simultaneously for the four stokes parameters ( @xmath55 for @xmath1 , and @xmath56 for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5).,width=332 ]    the retardance of a given device is wavelength dependent so these standard recipes generally work over a limited wavelength range .",
    "one could change the recipe to access other wavelengths but simultaneous spectro - polarimetric observations in different spectral ranges would not be possible .",
    "the chromatic nature of the example flc modulator is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flc ] showing the variation of the efficiency with wavelength . in the plot",
    ", we assume a target wavelength of 630 nm and that the intrinsic birefringence of the flcs is not a function of wavelength ( i.e. , no dispersion of the birefringence ) .",
    "we define the region of acceptable performance of a polarimeter as the region over which the efficiency is greater than the optimal efficiency divided by @xmath57 , that is , @xmath58 . at this point , the increase in noise is equivalent to a reduction in the photon flux by a factor of 2 , assuming poisson statistics . by this definition ,",
    "we find that the stepped - retarder solution is efficient over a spectral region of 268 nm , the lcvr solution over 287 nm , and the flc solution over 128 nm .",
    "to create polarimeters that operate over a large wavelength range , instrument developers have typically tried to select optical materials in order to make the polarimeter achromatic ; that is , to make the polarimeter modulation matrix as independent of wavelength as possible .",
    "the success of such an approach depends on the choice of materials and on the desired wavelength coverage . in principle",
    ", this affords an important simplification , which is the possibility of applying a single demodulation scheme to infer the stokes vector at any wavelength . in practice",
    ", the application of a single demodulation scheme can only give a zeroth - order approximation to the true stokes vector , because of the unavoidable residual wavelength dependence of the mueller matrix of the modulator across the spectral range of interest .",
    "for example , the achromatic modulator of nso / spinor shows a 15% variation of its retardance properties over its spectral range of operation ( 430 - 1600 nm , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore one still needs to perform a careful wavelength calibration of the polarimeter in order to infer the true stokes vector within the requirements of polarimetric sensitivity dictated by the science .",
    "previous work @xcite has also attempted to achromatize modulators by adding combinations of fixed and variable retarders , also with the goal of minimizing the wavelength dependence of the resulting mueller matrix .    however , the preservation of a given form of the polarimeter s mueller matrix with wavelength is a very limiting , and arguably unnecessary , constraint .",
    "the fundamental driver in the design of a polarization modulator for multi - line applications is the achievement of near - optimal modulation efficiencies in all stokes parameters at all wavelengths of interest .",
    "the mueller matrix of such a modulator can be completely arbitrary , and even strongly dependent on wavelength .",
    "since calibration with wavelength is required , such wavelength dependence will not impact the precision of the polarimetric measurements .",
    "in addition , since the demodulation matrix can be calculated theoretically from the modulator design , it is straightforward to provide real - time approximations of the measured stokes vector at all wavelengths of operation .    in designing the polarimeter for the 1-m yunnan solar telescope ( yunnan astronomical observatory , china )",
    "@xcite optimized the efficiency of their polarimeter over a broad wavelength range by adjusting the orientation of the fast axes of the retarding elements , and in our opinion created the first polychromatic modulator .",
    "however , @xcite did not fully optimize their design by allowing the retardations of the elements to vary , they did not adopt an optimal demodulation scheme as described in @xcite which could result in lowering the efficiency that is achieved , and they stressed the importance of minimizing crosstalk which is not necessary to achieve an optimally efficient polarimeter .",
    "we propose a new paradigm where full - stokes polarization modulators are designed to satisfy the constraint of having optimal and balanced polarimetric efficiency at all wavelengths of interest .",
    "this generally results in polarimeters that have modulation and demodulation matrices that are strong functions of wavelength .",
    "we refer to these modulators as polychromatic .",
    "we have developed a technique for optimizing polarization modulators using combinations of fixed and variable retarders .",
    "we find that varying the retardance and orientation of the optical components that comprise a modulator , and maximizing the polarimetric efficiency for all wavelengths of interest , results in realizable configurations with a high degree of wavelength diversity .",
    "we employ an optimization code that systematically searches the parameter space for a solution that maximizes the stokes modulation efficiencies over the desired spectral range .",
    "the search is performed following the strategy of latin hypercube sampling @xcite of the parameter space .",
    "this significantly improves the convergence speed of the search for the optimal solution , compared to a direct monte carlo sampling .",
    "although the solutions found through this method are highly optimized , they may not be unique .",
    "thus it is not possible to conclude with certainty that they represent the solutions with the highest possible efficiency for a given type of modulator .",
    "different optimization schemes based on gradient methods have also been used with success ( e.g. , powell , levenberg - marquardt ) , although they need realistic first guesses in order to converge properly .",
    "we illustrate this concept with three different types of polychromatic modulators for polarimetric applications .",
    "for the first type of modulator , we consider a stack of two flcs , with the possible addition of a fixed retarder to broaden the wavelength range .",
    "for this type of modulator , there are four modulation states .",
    "the broadening of the wavelength range of a flc modulator by the addition of fixed retarders has been suggested @xcite with the intention to minimize off - diagonal elements of the mueller matrix , although that study did not result in efficient modulators over a wide wavelength range .    as a first example",
    ", we start with the flc modulator used by the nso / dlsp and presented in table 1 .",
    "the dlsp was designed to operate at 630 nm only .",
    "figure  [ fig : flc ] ( continuous curve ) shows that the dlsp , as configured , has optimal and balanced efficiency at 630 nm with a spectral range of acceptable performance of 128 nm .",
    "we then optimized the efficiency of the dlsp modulator between 500 and 900 nm , by allowing the orientation angles of the flcs to vary .",
    "the resulting solution ( dotted curve ) is a simple modification of the nso / dlsp configuration ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) , where the first flc is rotated such that the new switching angles are @xmath54 and @xmath59 . with this new configuration , the modulator still provides optimal and balanced efficiency at 630 nm , however the usable range is now twice as large as before ( 259 nm ) .",
    "next , we added a fixed retarder between the two flcs , and allowed the orientations of the flcs and the retardance and orientation of the fixed retarder to vary .",
    "the resulting solution ( dashed curve ) yields a polarimeter with optimal and balanced efficiency at 630 nm , but the usable range now spans 553 nm .",
    "it must be noted that one can obtain even larger usable ranges with this type of modulator , when the optimization is extended to all the retarding devices .",
    "a clear example of this ( even if still subject to some external constraints ) is the promag modulator illustrated in sect .",
    "[ sec : promag ] .     as fig .",
    "[ fig : flc ] , but now for a modulator consisting of a stack of three quartz retarders rotated over 8 discrete steps of 22.5 degrees .",
    "the modulator was optimized between 380 and 1600 nm ( indicated by the two arrows).,width=332 ]    the second type of modulator is based on a stack of retarders glued in a fixed set of relative orientations , that is then rotated as a whole to the required set of positions to perform the measurement of the stokes vector .",
    "we consider a stepping modulator , rather than a continuously rotating one .",
    "the adoption of a continuous integration scheme results in a small reduction of the modulation efficiency .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a typical estimation of the reduction of modulation efficiency for continuously rotating modulators . for this type of rotating modulator",
    ", we consider the usual scheme with 8 measurements at positions @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",
    "the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : ret ] shows the modulation efficiency of a stack of three retarders .     as fig .",
    "[ fig : ret ] , but now for a modulator consisting of two lcvrs followed by a fixed quartz retarder , and using a 6-state modulation scheme .",
    "the modulator was optimized between 450 and 1600 nm ( indicated by the two arrows).,width=332 ]    the third type is based on a stack of lcvrs followed by a fixed retarder .",
    "the number of states of this kind of modulator is a free parameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : lcvr ] considers a modulator with 6 states .",
    "the parameter space for this kind of modulator has a much higher dimensionality than for designs based on flcs or fixed retarders , and therefore multiple solutions with comparable efficiencies are often found . the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcvr ] was determined by running the optimization several times and selecting the solution with the smallest deviation from optimal efficiency averaged over the optimization range .    in the solutions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ret][fig : lcvr ] , the fast axis of the first device is conventionally fixed at @xmath62 .",
    "we verified that this constraint does not affect the search of an optimally polychromatic solution for the modulator configuration . for practical purposes",
    ", we also assume that the fixed retarders are made of quartz , while for the lcvrs we assume no wavelength dispersion of the birefringence . while this limits the applicability of the recipes given in this paper , the implementation of realistic birefringence dispersion curves is possible .",
    "preliminary tests show that this is a mildly limiting factor in the search of high - efficiency modulator configurations , typically resulting in a narrower spectral range of optimization for a given number of retarding devices .",
    "specific science applications of polarimeters may require giving a higher priority to selected spectral lines and/or stokes polarization parameters .",
    "for this reason , in our optimization code both the optimizing wavelengths and the four stokes parameters can be attributed different weights in the search of a high - efficiency modulator configuration .",
    "the solutions shown here were derived without any specific application in mind , and therefore they had equal weights for all optimizing wavelengths and stokes parameters . in pratical situations , tweaking of some of the weights may be necessary to correct the behavior of the modulation efficiency in a particular interval of the spectral range .",
    "this is not surprising , especially in the optimization of the modulation efficiency over very large spectral ranges , since one needs to use a correspondingly large number of optimizing wavelengths ( typically , of the order of 50 ) , and the number of nearly equivalent solutions increases dramatically because of the increased number of degrees of freedom in the optimization problem . in such cases ,",
    "the use of different weights can help direct the search towards particular types of nearly equivalent solutions while excluding others , at the user s discretion .",
    "theoretical efficiency curves for the promag modulator , consisting of two flcs followed by a quartz retarder .",
    "the modulator was optimized at 587.6 , 656.3 , 769.9 , and 1083.0 nm ( indicated by arrows ) .",
    "the crosses indicate the measured efficiencies at 587.6 and 1083.0 nm after deployment of the instrument.,width=332 ]    as a first application of polychromatic modulators , we re - designed the polarimeter of the hao prominence magnetometer ( promag , @xcite ) .",
    "this instrument was conceived to observe solar prominences and filaments in the spectral lines of he i at 587.6 and 1083.0 nm , and also in h@xmath63 ( 656.3 nm ) .",
    "the re - design was prompted by a series of failed attempts at fabricating the promag modulator following the original design , which was based on a stack of six flcs @xcite .",
    "thus , the original design was replaced by a much simpler scheme , utilizing only two flcs plus a fixed retarder .",
    "the configuration was determined with the optimization method described above and constrained to use one of the flcs from the original design .",
    "retardances of the second flc and the fixed quartz retarder were specified according to the optimized solution , and the retardances of these devices were measured in the laboratory . since the measured retardances differed somewhat from the specified ones , a second optimization was performed varying only the orientations of the acquired devices using their measured retardances .",
    "the modulator was then constructed according to the design resulting from the second optimization .",
    "we estimate that the elements were oriented to the design values to within approximately @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ fig : promag ] shows the predicted efficiencies for the stokes parameters resulting from the optimization .",
    "actual efficiencies at 587.6 and 1083.0 nm were measured after deployment of the instrument at the evans solar facility of the nso / sp , and they are in good agreement with the theory ( see crosses in fig .  [ fig : promag ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy observed at 1083.0 nm is likely caused by a less precise determination of the retardances of the modulator optics at that wavelength , possibly due to an undetected leak in the interference filter used during the measurement in the laboratory , combined with the different spectral responses of the promag alpha - nir camera and the photo - diode used in the lab measurement .",
    "theoretical modulation matrix of promag .",
    "the crosses indicate the measured modulation amplitudes at 587.6 and 1083.0 nm .",
    "the first column of the matrix is identically equal to 1 and is not shown.,width=332 ]    the theoretical variation of the modulation matrix , @xmath9 , with wavelength is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : promag_matrix ] .",
    "the first column is unity and therefore is omitted .",
    "measured modulation amplitudes at 587.6 and 1083.0 nm are also shown to be in close agreement with the theory .",
    "in this paper we presented a new paradigm for the design of polarization modulators that responds to the needs of multi - line spectro - polarimetry .",
    "we argued that the effort of achromatizing the response matrix of a polarimeter  that is , trying to make the mueller matrix as little dependent on wavelength as possible  is both a very limiting and unnecessary constraint .",
    "the only requirement that should be imposed on a polarimeter , in order to reach a given target of polarimetric sensitivity , is that its modulation efficiency be sufficiently high at all wavelengths of interest .",
    "as these wavelengths may be distributed over very large spectral ranges ( of the order of 1000 nm or larger ) , and because of the wavelength dependence of the optical properties of retarding devices , the design of optimally efficient polarization modulators from first principles is a particularly arduous , if not impossible , task . for this reason",
    ", we have developed an improved monte carlo search technique in order to explore the parameter space of a polarimeter , and identify optimally efficient solutions compatible with the particular type of modulator .",
    "we illustrated the power of this method by improving the modulation efficiency of existing polarimetric instruments , as well as by designing new modulators with near optimal and balanced efficiency over very large spectral ranges .",
