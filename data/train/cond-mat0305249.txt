    "a complete statistical description of a transport process can be obtained from the full counting statistics ( fcs ) @xcite .",
    "the fcs of charge transport in mesoscopic conductors has recently attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "it was shown that scattering between uncorrelated fermi leads is described by binomial statistics @xcite , in which charge is transfered in elementary units .",
    "subsequently , the fcs in normal - superconducting systems have been studied and it was shown that andreev reflection leads to a doubled charge transfer @xcite .",
    "later on , several approaches to fcs have been put forward .",
    "a theory of full counting statistics based on keldysh - green s function was developed@xcite .",
    "this formulation allows a straightforward generalization to superconductors @xcite , multi - terminal structures @xcite and coulomb blockade systems @xcite . as another example , the fcs of charge transport was expressed via the counting statistics @xcite of photons emitted from the conductor .",
    "very recently , a classical path - integral approach to fcs was developed @xcite .",
    "the second moment of the fcs is related to the shot noise @xcite .",
    "suppression of the shot noise from the classical poisson value can result from the fermi statistics of the electrons @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting are the correlations between currents at different terminals  the cross correlations . for uncorrelated",
    "fermi leads they are in general negative @xcite , which has been experimentally confirmed@xcite .",
    "if the current is injected from a superconducting terminal , the sign of the cross - correlations may become positive @xcite .",
    "if the proximity effect is absent both negative cross correlations@xcite and positive cross correlations@xcite were theoretically predicted .",
    "the positive correlations are a direct consequences of the charge being transfered in pairs across the normal - superconducting interface @xcite .",
    "this is the case , independent of the presence or absence of the proximity effect in the normal metal .",
    "since the proximity effect introduces additional pair correlations , it is of special interest to investigate , under general circumstances , the charge transfer in normal - superconducting systems with suppressed proximity effect .",
    "all transport properties of quasiclassical superconductor- normal metal heterostructures can be calculated from the so - called circuit theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is a discretization of the normal metal parts into connectors and nodes .",
    "the mesh has to be chosen in a way that approximates the real structure to the required precision .",
    "to each node ( label i ) a matrix green s function @xmath0 is ascribed .",
    "a matrix current @xmath1 flows through the connector between nodes i and j. conservation of the matrix current on each node @xmath2 together with the normalization condition @xmath3 determine the unique solution for the whole circuit .",
    "connections to the external world are represented by terminals ( labeled with @xmath4 ) with a fixed matrix green s function @xmath5 .",
    "electrons and holes ( connected by andreev reflection at the superconducting terminals ) propagate through the structure . in the circuit theory",
    "the decoherence due to the finite energy difference @xmath6 between electron and hole is described by a _ decoherence terminal _",

    "thus , the superconductor matrix current constitutes a ( 2@xmath272)-matrix current between electron and hole green s functions of the node .",
    "note , that the transmission probabilities are given by the andreev reflection probabilities .",
    "we conclude , that the transmission properties between electron and hole blocks ( mirrored at the superconductor ) have _ exactly _ the form of a normal contact with the usual transmission probabilities @xmath28 replaced by @xmath29 .    with this result , we are ready to present the mapping rules@xcite , illustrated in fig . [",

    "all normal elements , normal terminals and all connectors between normal parts of the circuit are doubled ( electron and hole circuit ) .",
    "the superconducting terminals are the only connections between electron and hole circuit .",
    "they play the role of normal connectors , in which the normal transmission eigenvalues @xmath28 are replaced by the andreev reflection probabilities @xmath26 .",
    "a counting field @xmath30 is assigned to corresponding electron and hole terminals .",
    "the counting statistics is obtained from the solution of the normal circuit .",
    "an important general property of the extended circuit is electron - hole symmetry . in our case",
    "this is formally a consequence of the perfect symmetry of the extended circuit .",
    "mathematically the symmetry relation reads @xmath31 below we will use this symmetry relation to obtain some general properties of beam splitters .",
    "we can draw a general conclusion about the parity of the transfered charge number through the superconductor . due to the andreev process",
    "this number should be even . since we have replaced the superconducting circuit by a purely normal on",
    ", the even parity is not obvious anymore .",
    "however , for a two terminal device the fcs is @xmath32-periodic in the difference between the counting fields @xmath33 , which , according to our rules , should be replaced by @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the cgf is now a @xmath35-periodic function of @xmath36 .",
    "this argument can be generalized to an arbitrary number of terminals , if we are interested only in the charge transfer through the superconductor .",
    "the total transfered charge is obtained by taking all counting fields equal . again",
    "the cgf depends only on differences between counting fields and , therefore , charge transfers between two electron ( or hole ) terminals are not counted . with the same argument as given above , it follows that the total cgf is invariant under a shift of all counting fields by @xmath35 .",
    "as a check , we first apply the mapping rules to a simple two - terminal contact without internal structure .",
    "the results for the cumulant generating function ( cgf ) of a normal contact with transmission eigenvalues @xmath23 is @xcite ( @xmath37 ) @xmath38\\,,\\ ] ] where we have introduced the number of attempts per channel @xmath39 . using the recipe outlined above we replace @xmath28 by @xmath29 and @xmath40 by @xmath34 and find @xmath41\\,,\\ ] ] which is the result first obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the counting statistics of a diffusive wire between a normal and a superconducting terminal can also be found analytically .",
    "let us write the cgf of a normal diffusive conductor with conductance @xmath42 as @xcite @xmath43 now , according to the mapping rules , we have to replace the diffusive connector by two diffusive wires in series .",
    "we can neglect the interface resistance and use that the cgf for a series of two diffusive conductors is the same as for a single diffusive conductor . the total conductance is halved and we thus find @xmath44 this result proves that the fcs of the diffusive sn - wire in the incoherent regime is the same as in the coherent regime@xcite , which has so far only been demonstrated for the first two moments @xcite .    as another example we consider a chaotic dot , which is much stronger coupled to the superconductor than to the normal terminal . in this case",
    ", the connector between the electron- and hole node does not contribute to the fcs ( the green s functions in the electron and the hole dots are the same ) .",
    "we can then consider the equivalent circuit with a single dot , symmetrically coupled to the electron and hole terminals .",
    "the green s functions of electron and hole terminal are ( for @xmath45 and @xmath37 ) @xmath46 for a moment we take independent counting fields in the electron and hole terminal , and replace @xmath47 only in the end .",

    "we now turn to the general case of the counting statistics of a beam splitter as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapping ] .",
    "the central node is connected to several normal terminals ( labeled with @xmath4 ) and one superconducting terminal .",
    "this structure has been studied in different limits in refs .",
    "@xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : snmatrix - simple ] ) it is clear that the andreev conductance @xmath53 governs the coupling between the electron and hole circuit .",
    "we assume here that the superconductor is only weakly coupled to the beam splitter in the sense that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the conductance of the connector to terminal @xmath4 .",
    "all normal terminals are held at the same potential @xmath56 and zero temperature . expanding all quantities to first order in @xmath57 , we find ( similar to ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the total cgf can be expressed by the cgf of the superconducting contact alone : @xmath58\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath59 is the electron green s function of the central node in the absence of the superconductor ( for @xmath60 ) .",
    "all green s functions are evaluated at @xmath61 and we used eq .",

    "the green s function @xmath62 can be obtained quite generally . due to the triangular shape of all @xmath63 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : terminalgf ] ) ) , also @xmath62 has the same form .",
    "the matrix current between the central node and terminal @xmath4 then becomes @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "thus , all normal connectors behave as tunnel contacts .",
    "the solution for the central node is @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "it then follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : weaks - fcs ] ) , that the cgf is @xmath68\\,.\\ ] ] such a cgf leads to a fcs of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of transfered cooper pairs .",
    "the total probability distribution is therefore the probability @xmath71 that @xmath72 cooper pairs are transfered , and then distributed among the normal terminals with respective probabilities @xmath73 .",
    "a similar result has previously been obtained for tunnel contacts @xcite and a chaotic cavity @xcite .",
    "here , this derivation holds for _ any _ type of connector , _",
    "i.  e. _ point contacts , diffusive wires , single transparency , etc .",
    "we note that if the beam splitter is connected to the superconductor by another connector ( incoherent ! ) , the solution is again given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cgf_weaks ] ) .",
    "this is the case since the additional node , connected directly to the superconductor , has the same green s function as the central beamsplitter node , @xmath59 , to leading order in @xmath57 , _ i.  e. _ with the superconductor completely decoupled .",
    "another important case is when the superconductor is strongly coupled to the beam splitter , _",
    "i.  e. _ @xmath74 . in this limit",
    "the superconducting connector is absent and the system is a chaotic dot coupled to the electron and hole terminals .",
