    "4u  1957 + 11is one of the few black hole candidates ( bhc ) , like lmc  x-1 , lmc  x-3 , and cyg  x-1 , that historically has been persistently active .",
    "in contrast to these other sources , however , it is a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ; see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "also in contrast to other persistent galactic bhc sources , 4u  1957 + 11apparently has remained always in a spectrally soft state @xcite .",
    "its soft spectrum is well - modeled as a simple disk @xcite , i.e. , a multi - temperature blackbody @xcite characterized by a peak temperature and a normalization related to the disk inner radius , inclination , and object distance .",
    "approximately 15% of the over 40 pointed observations taken with the",
    "_ _ r__ossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) , however , also show a significant contribution ( 2075% of the observed 318kev flux ) from a non - thermal / steep powerlaw component @xcite .",
    "optical observations suggest that we may be viewing the disk in 4u  1957 + 11at a high inclination of @xmath5 .",
    "modulation over a 9.33hr orbital period has ranged from @xmath6 and sinusoidal @xcite to @xmath7 and complex @xcite .",
    "the latter has been interpreted as a high inclination warped disk being partly occulted by the secondary . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite failed to find any optical modulation over the orbital period , while @xcite found nearly sinusoidal modulation .",
    "these latter authors attributed the optical modulation to illumination of the secondary , and noting a lack of any flattening at the lightcurve minimum , they modeled the system inclination with values as low as @xmath8 and not greater than @xmath9 .",
    "currently , the mass , distance , and inclination of 4u  1957 + 11are unknown . based upon a comparison of the optical flux to the estimated optical luminosities of other bhc , however ,",
    "@xcite have argued that 4u  1957 + 11must lie at a distance @xmath10kpc .",
    "the possibility of a high inclination , however , makes such comparisons problematic .",
    "@xcite recently have presented near - simultaneous radio ( _ expanded very large array _  _ evla _ ) , optical ( _ faulkes telescope north _ ) , and uv / x - ray ( _ swift _ ) observations of 4u  1957 + 11 .",
    "these observations show the soft state flux to be extremely quenched ( factors of 330810 times lower than the expected radio / x - ray flux ratio for hard state black hole sources ) , and demonstrate that the optical / uv flux are roughly consistent with the expectation of an irradiated disk .",
    "those observations , however , do not definitively constrain the source s inclination or distance . a minimum distance of @xmath11kpc ; however , has been determined via high resolution x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "neix @xmath12  absorption , associated with the warm / hot phase of the interstellar medium , is detected with a sufficient equivalent width to suggest that 4u  1957 + 11resides above the galactic plane at this minimum distance or beyond @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that , with the exception of the @xmath13% of the time when a non - thermal component becomes prominent , disk models of the soft x - ray component have an approximately constant radius but a temperature that increases with flux ( see fig .",
    "9 of @xcite ) .",
    "there is some indication for a slight increase in disk radius at the lowest flux levels , which was interpreted as possibly being associated with the source approaching a transition to a spectrally hard state .",
    "such a transition is expected to occur at 23%@xmath14 , where @xmath14 is the eddington luminosity for the source in question @xcite . at the other extremes of flux in 4u  1957 + 11 , the simple disk spectrum `` drops out '' ( disk radius decreases in disk+powerlaw fits , or disk temperature decreases in disk+compton corona fits ) and",
    "is replaced by the non - thermal / steep powerlaw component @xcite .",
    "although other persistent systems transiently show disk - dominated spectra , the persistent , soft spectra of 4u  1957 + 11are perhaps the simplest and cleanest examples of `` disk spectra '' .",
    "_ xmm - newton_and _ chandra_observations show that there is very little absorption ( @xmath15@xmath16 ) , while _",
    "rxte_observations show that a hard tail contributes usually @xmath17 of the flux .",
    "furthermore , any additional components such as a broad fe line ( typically @xmath18 peak residual in the fits ) or a `` smeared fe edge '' ( which was never required or indicated in any of the _ rxte_spectra ; @xcite ) are very weak or absent .",
    "thus the soft spectrum of 4u  1957 + 11becomes the ideal testbed for modern disk atmosphere models that incorporate spin and other general relativistic effects into their calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "rxte_spectra of 4u  1957 + 11are characterized by a very low normalization , indicating some combination of large distance and low compact object mass , and very high inner disk temperature ( 1.31.8kev ) . in other sources",
    "the latter has been associated with high black hole spin . to assess this possibility ,",

    "xis2 was lost due to a micrometeor hit in late 2006 , and thus we only consider data from the remaining three xisdetectors .",
    "for all three observations described here , the hard x - ray fluxes were too low to lead to a significant detection in either of the hxddetectors , and therefore we do not include these data .",
    "a log of the observations is found in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "all of the xisobservations were run in a sub - array mode wherein 1/4 of the ccd was exposed with 2 second integration times . in preparing the xisspectra , we first corrected each detector for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) using the ` xispi ` tool , and then reprocessed the data with ` xselect ` using the standard ` xisrepro ` selection criteria . due to thermal flexing of the spacecraft , the attitude of the _ suzaku_spacecraft exhibits variability over the course of the observations and therefore the image of the source is not at a fixed position on the ccd .",
    "standard processing reduces this variability and improves the point spread function ( psf ) image @xcite ; however , the standard tools do not yet fully correct the variable attitude induced blurring .",
    "we created an improved attitude reconstruction , and hence narrower psf images , using the ` aeattcor.sl ` software described by @xcite . for the third observation , however , approximately half of the good time intervals ( i.e. , half of each spacecraft orbit )",
    "were affected by wobbles severe enough ( @xmath26 ) such that a large fraction of the image on the xis1 detector fell beyond the boundaries of the detector s active regions .",
    "although the images did not fall beyond the active region boundaries on the xis0 and xis3 detectors , there are serious questions about the accuracy of the generated response functions for such large off axis angles .",
    "we therefore excluded these times from the spectra , and reflect this in table  [ tab : data ] .    using the image generated from the improved attitude correction",
    ", we then used the ` pile_estimate.sl ` ` s - lang ` script @xcite to estimate the degree of pileup in the xisobservations . for the spectra described in this work ,",
    "the center of the psf images were affected by as much as a 33% pileup fraction .",
    "we therefore exclude two , overlapping rectangular regions ( @xmath27 pixels , nearly at right angles to one another ) aligned along the brightest portions of the central psf ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ds9 ] ) .",
    "we estimate that the remaining residual pileup fractions are @xmath28 .",
    "the outer limit of the extraction area was a rectangular region limited by the @xmath29 width of the 1/4 array boundaries .",
    "additionally , we extracted background spectra from small rectangular regions , near the edges of the chips , that avoided as much as possible both the 4u  1957 + 11image as well as the detector images of the on - board calibration sources .",
    "it is not entirely clear to what degree these regions are dominated by `` true background '' , as opposed to the wings of the psf from the source .",
    "however , the normalized background flux remains at @xmath18 of the source flux between 0.58kev , and thus does not strongly affect the analyses presented in this work .",
    "the background flux starts to become an increasingly larger fraction of the source flux above 8kev .",
    "for this reason , as well as due to any other uncertainties in the high energy calibration of the xisdetectors , we do not consider data above 8kev .",
    "events in the xisdetectors were read out from either @xmath30 or @xmath31 pixel islands .",
    "we created individual spectra and response files for each detector and data mode combination .",
    "little source variability was detected over the course of each observation , therefore the spectra were created for the full good time intervals represented by standard processing ( excluding the times of very bad attitude errors , discussed above ) .",
    "response matrices and effective area files were created with the ` xisrmfgen ` and ` xissimarfgen ` tools , respectively . for each observation ,",
    "spectra for the different readout modes were combined during analysis on a chip - by - chip basis using the combine_datasets function within the interactive spectral interpretation system ( isis ) fitting program @xcite .",
    "that is , observations were kept separate , but within an observation all xis0 spectra were combined together , all xis1 spectra were combined , etc .",
    "although spectra for each observation and each xischip were kept separate , all spectra were jointly grouped on a common grid such that the xis0 spectra for the third ( i.e. , the faintest and shortest integration time ) observation had a minimum combined signal - to - noise ratio of 5 in each energy bin ( @xmath32 total counts in each bin , although the estimated background was included in the s / n criterion ) and that the minimum number of channels per energy bin was at least the half width half maximum of the spectral resolution ( see * ? ? ?",

    "these systematic effects are seen in a wide variety of unrelated _ suzaku_spectra , hence our decision to exclude them from our fits . likewise , there is a strong spectral feature near 0.55kev , which we also suspect of being systematic in nature , hence our exclusion of data below 0.7kev . to avoid these regions of poorly understood response",
    ", we only considered spectral energy ranges 0.71.5kev and 2.68kev .",
    "the smaller features near 0.75kev and 0.9kev are plausibly associated with fe l , ne k , and ne ix absorption in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , as we discuss below .",
    "the suspected systematic features are relatively constant among the three observations , as is evident from the ratio of the flux corrected spectra as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .",
    "none of the systematic features are seen in these ratios .",
    "the ratios are relatively flat @xmath33kev , and show a curve upward , with the degree of this curving being greatest for the ratio of the flux corrected spectra for the first and third observation .",
    "we discuss this further in the next section .",
    "the spectral shape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] , and the ratios seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , are those expected for a disk - dominated spectrum wherein the flux changes are primarily dominated by variations of the peak temperature of the disk .",
    "we show the theoretical expectation for such a disk in fig .",
    "[ fig : tratio ] .",
    "here we use the diskpn model @xcite , which essentially is the spectrum from a shakura - sunyaev type disk @xcite calculated using a simple pseudo - netwonian potential and a no - torque boundary condition at the disk inner edge located at @xmath34 .",
    "the flux goes to zero at the disk inner edge , and the disk temperature peaks at @xmath35 .",
    "this basic disk spectrum will underly the comptonization fits discussed below .    at energies approximately below the peak temperature , dominated by the rayleigh - jeans part of the thermal spectra , the ratios are fairly flat . at energies above the disk peak temperature , on the wien tail of the thermal spectra , the ratios curve upward .",

    "rxte_spectra which extended out to @xmath36kev , there is the possibility of additional spectral hardening beyond that associated with any rise in disk temperature .",

    "we speculate that our fits are near  optimal. throughout the rest of this work , the figures will include only statistical errors ; however , tables will include sets of parameters with error bars that were calculated for spectra to which 1.35% systematic errors have been applied .",
    "this systematic error amplitude was chosen on the basis that it yields a reduced @xmath41 value of @xmath47 for the fits described above , and we retain this level in subsequent model fits for ease of comparison .",
    "the primary difference among the three spectra are the disk peak temperatures , which range between 1.311.48kev .",

    "when combined with their equilibrium optical depths , we find that the resulting compton @xmath51-parameters range from 0.10.2 .",
    "that is , comptonization is only inducing a modest shift in the average photon energy .",

    "we consider two sets of fits , one with mass of 3@xmath1 and distance 10kpc , and another with 16@xmath1 and distance 22kpc .",
    "for both we allow the black hole spin to be a free parameter , and we create grids of fits for fixed spectral hardening factors ranging over @xmath923.7 .",
    "the plot of fitted spin , @xmath93 , vs. spectral hardening factor , @xmath60 , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] .    as for our prior _",
    "rxte_observations , we find that fits using @xmath61 , 10kpc , and @xmath92 or @xmath70 , 22kpc , and @xmath69 are nearly equally good and are of comparable @xmath41 to our best comptonization fits .",
    "we also see that all fits using @xmath70 , and 22kpc require large spin parameters . the fits using @xmath61 and",
    "10kpc only achieve low spin parameters for large color correction factors , @xmath94 .",
    "( these conclusions are unaltered if uniform 1.35% systematic errors are included in the fits . )",
    "there are four salient features of these _ suzaku_observations of 4u  1957 + 11that echo the results that we obtained with our prior _",
    "chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ rxte_studies .",
    "the peak disk temperatures are high , the disk normalizations ( or equivalently , emitting areas or inner disk radii ) are small , all observations can be fit with the same inner disk radius , and the spectra are remarkably simple . the only significant deviations from a simple continuum , aside from spectral hardening and a possible weak , broad fe line at high energy , are @xmath95@xmath96kev features associated with absorption by the ism , predominantly due to the fe l and ne edges .",
    "we show a closeup of this region in fig .",
    "[ fig : edge ] . the spectral feature seen at @xmath97kev , not described by our fitted models , can in fact be seen in the flux corrected spectra of _ any _ monochromatic , narrow line spectrum simulated using the _ suzaku_response functions .",
    "small calibration errors in the amplitude of this feature potentially could lead to a systematic underestimate or overestimate of the predicted counts near 0.55kev .",
    "we thus do not believe that this feature is indicative of physical complexity in the underlying 4u  1957 + 11spectra .",
    "likewise , it is unclear whether the @xmath98 residuals seen near the 0.7kev fe l edge represent complexity in the physical spectrum , as opposed to uncertainty in the response . aside from the fe l edges , _",
    "chandra_and _ xmm - newton_spectra did not show any spectral features near the 0.7kev bandpass @xcite .",
    "the only clear spectral features are the ne edge / ne ix absorption near 0.9kev .",
    "similarly simple disk spectra were implied by _",
    "suzaku_observations of lmc  x-3 in its soft , disk dominated state @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , such spectral simplicity is in fact surprising if modern disk atmosphere models apply to these sources .",
    "these disk atmosphere models predict spectral structure with @xmath99 amplitude near metal edges @xcite that is seen neither here nor in _",
    "suzaku_observations of lmc  x-3 .",
    "that the simplest , phenomenological disk models lacking such features describe the spectra extremely well ( i.e. , to within @xmath100% 0.70.8kev , and to @xmath101 above 0.8kev ) is quite remarkable , and may indicate that additional physics needs to be incorporated into the disk atmosphere models @xcite .",
    "we also have confirmed the results of our prior studies in that the best fits assuming a small mass and distance ( 3@xmath1 , 10kpc ) require a black hole spin @xmath102 .",
    "the required spin increases if we instead assume 16@xmath1 and 22kpc . altering the assumed disk inclination does not change this situation .",
    "higher disk inclinations are ruled out by the lack of system eclipses .",
    "lower disk inclinations allow for more observed gravitational redshifting , and less relativistic beaming , of the spectrum , and thus require larger spectral correction factors .",
    "( i.e. , inclination effects more than just the projected area of the disk . ) as an example , we took the 16@xmath1 and 22kpc ` kerrbb ` model , froze the inclination to @xmath103 and let both the black hole spin and hardness correction factor become free parameters . a solution with @xmath41 comparable to the best fits discussed above",
    "was found , however , it required _ maximally negative spin _ of @xmath104 and an extremely large color correction factor of @xmath105 .",
    "thus , high spin / high inclination solutions are the most `` straightforward '' solutions that we have been able to obtain , and generally have had the lowest color - correction factors of the models that we have explored ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "these results are in fact confirmed by the comptonization model fits : the high disk temperatures ( 1.311.48kev ) and especially the low normalization  15 times lower than expected for a @xmath61 schwarzschild black hole at 10kpc  could be indicative of a rapidly spinning black hole . as discussed above , the disk temperature in the diskpn seed photons used in the comptonization model peaks at @xmath65 .",
    "if one were to reduce this radius to @xmath106 , i.e. , change the emission profile to more closely match that of a rapidly spinning hole , then the comptonization model normalization would be consistent with a @xmath61 black hole at only 10kpc .",
    "the comptonization models offer two possibilities for fitting the 4u  1957 + 11spectrum with a low spin .",
    "the first , perhaps less likely , possibility is to increase the color - correction factor via a low temperature , optically thick corona .",
    "we have already seen that the lowest flux observations are fit with such coronae , albeit with a compton @xmath51-parameter of @xmath107 .",
    "instead , we are envisioning a scenario wherein @xmath108  the color correction value required to fit a @xmath61 , 10kpc , schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this would require an optical depth of @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the coronal temperature .",
    "this is a coronal regime typically not explored in spectral models .",
    "the concept would be that the low flux , equilibrium solution of the disk was such a cool , optically thick atmosphere which at higher flux ( i.e. , the 15% of the time requiring a hard tail ) expanded into a hot , optically thin corona .    aside from lacking a theoretical description of such a scenario , the fitted constant emitting area at low flux implies that the 4u  1957 + 11system must always return to the _ same _ equilibrium coronal solution at low flux .",
    "it is not clear why this should be the case .",
    "the second possibility offered by the comptonization solutions is simply to increase the distance to 4u  1957 + 11 , while keeping the mass small .",
    "the scaling relations discussed in section  [ sec : scale ] only apply under the assumption that the lowest flux observations are a fixed fraction of the eddington luminosity ( e.g. , 2%@xmath14 ) . if we relax this assumption , then eq .",
    "[ eq : scale ] suggests that if the 4u  1957 + 11distance were 40kpc , then it could be a @xmath61 schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this would imply , however , that the _ faintest _",
    "4u  1957 + 11spectra are @xmath111 , while the brightest observed _",
    "rxte_spectra are @xmath112",
    ". this would be rather unusual , especially given the lack of strong variability found in the _ rxte_spectra : the root mean square variability is typically @xmath28 , and at its strongest was @xmath113 in the 260kev bandpass over @xmath114@xmath115hz @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems likely that 4u 1957 + 11 is a system that has a combination of both high spin and large distance , which puts this x - ray binary in the galaxy s halo .",
    "it is interesting to speculate whether these two characteristics are related to one another .",
    "first , we note the obvious fact that in order for 4u 1957 + 11 to be a x - ray binary it must still be accreting and therefore be a comparatively young system .",
    "given the low star formation rate in the galaxy s halo , it is rather unlikely , therefore , that 4u 1957 + 11 was formed in the halo .",
    "instead 4u 1957 + 11 likely originates in the galactic disk and then migrated into the halo .",
    "several possible formation scenarios have been discussed in the literature , most recently associated with the discovery of young hypervelocity stars in the galaxy s halo .",
    "for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) discuss a scenario where hypervelocity binary systems are created through the interaction of a hierarchical triple star system with the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy . since hierarchical triples are very common among multiple star systems , such a scenario is likely . with a typical ejection velocity of 1800@xmath116 , it would take this system a few @xmath117years to reach its current position , well within the lifetime of typical evolution scenarios for x - ray binary systems @xcite .",
    "( at such a velocity , and assuming a 22kpc distance , the proper motion of 4u  1957 + 11likely would have amounted to @xmath118 since the discovery of the optical counterpart by @xcite . )",
    "such a scenario could also explain a large spin for the system , if during the ejection angular momentum is transferred onto the black hole .    a high black hole spin for 4u  1957 + 11is a consistent interpretation of the results presented here ; however , such a result is dependent upon the unknown mass , distance , and inclination of the system . given the nature of 4u  1957 + 11as perhaps the simplest , cleanest example of a bhc soft state , and perhaps the most rapidly spinning black hole , observations to independently determine this system s",
