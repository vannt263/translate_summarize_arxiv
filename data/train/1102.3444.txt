    "nearly all gaseous objects that shine are also observed to generate gaseous flows .",
    "this includes the jets of protostars , the stellar winds of massive o and b stars , the gentle solar wind of our sun , the associated absorption of bright quasars , and the spectacular jets of radio - loud agn .",
    "these gaseous outflows regulate the metal and dust content and distribution within the objects and their surroundings , moderate the accretion of new material , and inject energy and momentum into gas on large scales . developing a comprehensive model for these flows is critical to understanding the evolution of the source and its impact on the surrounding environment .",
    "starburst galaxies , whose luminosity is dominated by regions and massive stars , are also observed to drive gaseous outflows .",
    "these flows are generally expected ( and sometimes observed ) to have multiple phases , for example a hot and diffuse phase traced by x - ray emission together with a cool , denser phase traced by h@xmath6 emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several spectacular examples in the local universe demonstrate that flows can extend to up to @xmath7 kpc from the galaxy @xcite carrying significant speed to escape from the gravitational potential well of the galaxy s dark matter halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "galactic outflows are also revealed by uv and optical absorption lines , e.g.  , , and transitions . with the galaxy as a backlight",
    ", one observes gas that is predominantly blue - shifted which indicates a flow toward earth and away from the galaxy .",
    "these transitions are sensitive to the cool (; @xmath8k ) and warm (;",
    "@xmath9k ) phases of the flow .",
    "the incidence of cool gas outflows is nearly universal in vigorously star - forming galaxies ; this includes systems at low @xmath10 which exhibit and absorption @xcite , @xmath11 star - forming galaxies with winds traced by and transitions @xcite , and @xmath12 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) that show blue - shifted , , and transitions @xcite .    the observation of metal - line absorption is now a well - established means of identifying outflows .",
    "furthermore , because the x - ray and h@xmath6 emission generated by winds is faint , absorption - line analyses have traditionally been the only way to probe outflows in distant galaxies .",
    "however , very little research has been directed toward comparing the observations against ( even idealized ) wind models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "instead , researchers have gleaned what limited information is afforded by direct analysis of the absorption lines .",
    "the data diagnose the speed of the gas relative to the galaxy , yet they poorly constrain the optical depth , covering fraction , density , temperature , and distance of the flow from the galaxy . in turn , constraints related to the mass , energetics , and momentum of the flow suffer from orders of magnitude uncertainty . both the origin and impact of galactic - scale winds , therefore , remain open matters of debate @xcite",
    ".    recent studies of @xmath13 star - forming galaxies have revealed that the cool outflowing gas often exhibits significant resonant - line emission ( e.g. , ) in tandem with the nearly ubiquitous blue - shifted absorption @xcite .",
    "the resultant spectra resemble the p - cygni profile characteristic of stellar winds .",
    "this phenomenon was first reported by @xcite , who observed blue - shifted absorption and red - shifted emission for the transition in the spectrum of the local starburst galaxy ngc 1808 .",
    "more recently , @xcite , who studied absorption in @xmath14 galaxies , reported emission in a small subset of the individual galaxy spectra of their large sample .",
    "these were excluded from the full analysis on concerns that the emission was related to agn activity .",
    "the stacked spectra of the remaining galaxies , however , also indicated emission , both directly and when the authors modeled and ` removed ' the @xmath15 absorption component .",
    "the authors suggested the emission could be related to back - scattered light in the wind , but presumed that it was related to weak agn activity .",
    "very similar emission was observed by @xcite who repeated the analysis of @xcite on a set of lower redshift galaxies .",
    "bright line emission has also been reported for individual galaxies at @xmath16 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also rubin et al  2011 , in prep . ) . in their analysis of a single galaxy spectrum",
    ", @xcite further demonstrated that the line emission is spatially extended , and used the size of the emission to infer that the wind extends to at least 7kpc from the galaxy .",
    "these authors additionally detected line emission from non - resonant @xmath17 transitions , and attributed the emission to fluorescence powered by resonant absorption .",
    "in other words , these photons are re - emitted by the wind into our sightline , and are analogous to the emitted photons in a p - cygni profile .",
    "line - emission that may be related to outflows is also observed for @xmath4 lbgs in the resonant  transition and non - resonant @xmath17 transitions . ]",
    "this emission likely arises from a completely different physical process than those generating x - ray and h@xmath6 emission ( e.g. , shocks ) , and presumably probes both the cool gas at the base of the wind and the outskirts of the flow ( i.e. , wherever a given transition is optically thick ) .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of the scattered and fluorescent emission related to galactic - scale outflows ( e.g.  via deep integral - field - unit [ ifu ] observations , @xcite ) may offer unique diagnostics on the spatial extent , morphology , and density of the outflow from distant galaxies , eventually setting tighter constraints on the energetics of the flow .",
    "although astronomers are rapidly producing a wealth of observational datasets on galactic - scale winds , a key ingredient to a proper analysis is absent . just as comparisons between observed supernova lightcurves and spectra and radiative transfer calculations of of sne models have provided crucial insight into the physics driving , e.g. , standard candle relationships for both type ia and iip sne @xcite , modeling of the observable signatures of galactic outflows",
    "is necessary for understanding the physical properties of the gas and ultimately the physics driving the flows . in this paper , we take the first steps toward modeling the absorption and emission properties of cool gas outflows as observed in one dimensional spectra and by ifus . using monte carlo radiative transfer techniques , we study the nature of and absorption and emission for winds with a range of properties , accounting for the effects of resonant scattering and fluorescence .",
    "although the winds are idealized , the results frequently contradict our intuition and challenge the straightforward conversion of observables to ( even crude ) physical constraints .",
    "these findings have a direct bearing on recent and upcoming surveys of galactic outflows , particularly those which make use of and transitions to probe outflow properties .",

    "this is somewhat surprising given that the density is @xmath520  orders of magnitude lower at these radii than at @xmath521pc .",
    "more importantly , we question whether any physical process could produce a wind with such extreme profiles .      in the previous sub - section , we described a sobolev inversion that reproduces the average absorption profile of lbgs in cool gas transitions when scattered photons are ignored . a proper analysis that includes scattered photons , however , predicts line - profiles that are qualitatively different from the observations because scattered photons fill - in absorption and generate significant line - emission ( similar to the fiducial wind model ; @xmath18  [ sec : fiducial ] ) .",

    ", models with very different density / velocity laws can produce rather similar results .",
    "for example , profiles that have declining opacity with increasing velocity offset from systemic can be obtained with a radial velocity law that increases ( e.g.  the fiducial model ) or decreases ( model  d ) .",
    "the implication is that absorption profiles alone are likely insufficient to fully characterize the physical characteristics of the outflow .",
    "we now discuss the principal results of our analysis and comment on the observational consequences and implications .",
    "the previous sections presented idealized wind models for cool gas outflows , and explored the absorption / emission profiles of the  @xmath0  doublet and the uv1 multiplet .",
    "in addition to the ubiquitous presence of blue - shifted absorption , the wind models also predict strong line - emission in both resonance and non - resonance transitions . for isotropic and dust - free scenarios ,",
    "this is due to the simple conservation of photons : every photon emitted by the source eventually escapes the system to maintain zero total equivalent width .",
    "a principal result of this paper , therefore , is that galaxies with observed cool gas outflows should also generate detectable line - emission .",
    "indeed , line - emission from low - ion transitions has been reported from star - forming galaxies that exhibit cool gas outflows .",
    "this includes emission related to @xcite , emission @xcite , * emission from lbgs @xcite , and , most recently , significant *  emission @xcite .",
    "a variety of origins have been proposed for this line - emission including agn activity , recombination in regions , and back - scattering off the galactic - scale wind .",
    "our results suggest that the majority of the observed line - emission is from scattered photons in the cool gas outflows of these star - forming galaxies .",
    "indeed , line - emission should be generated by all galaxies driving a cool gas outflow .",
    "on the other hand , there are many examples of galaxies where blue - shifted absorption is detected yet the authors report no significant line emission .",
    "this includes flows @xcite , and absorption in ulirgs @xcite , and the extreme outflows identified by @xcite .",
    "similarly , there have been no reports of resonance line - emission from low - ion transitions in the lbgs , and many @xmath13 galaxies show no detectable or * emission despite significant blue - shifted absorption ( rubin et al . , in prep ) .",
    "these non - detections appear to contradict a primary conclusion of this paper .",
    "we are motivated , therefore , to reassess several of the effects that can reduce the line - emission and consider whether these prevent its detection in many star - forming galaxies .",
    "dust is frequently invoked to explain the suppression of line - emission for resonantly trapped transitions ( e.g.  ) .",
    "indeed , a photon that is trapped for many scatterings within a dusty medium will be preferentially extincted relative to a non - resonant photon . in @xmath18  [",
    "sec : dust ] , we examined the effects of dust extinction on and emission . the general result ( figure  [ fig : dust_tau ] ) is a modest reduction in flux that scales as ( 1+@xmath65)@xmath19 instead of exp(@xmath65 ) .",
    "although the photons are resonantly trapped , they require only one to a few scatterings to escape the wind thereby limiting the effects of dust .",
    "this reflects the moderate opacity of the doublet ( e.g.  relative to ) and also the velocity law of the fiducial wind model . in scenarios",
    "where the photons are more effectively trapped , dust does suppress the emission ( e.g.  in the ism+wind model from @xmath18  [ sec : ism ] ) .",
    "in contrast to , the resonance photons may be converted to non - resonant photons that freely escape the wind .",
    "therefore , a wind model that traps photons for many scatterings does not similarly trap  @xmath37  photons . the effects of dust are much reduced and , by inference , the same holds for any other set of transitions that are coupled to a fine - structure level ( e.g./ * ) . in summary",
    ", dust does reduce the line flux relative to the continuum , but it generally has only a modest effect on the predicted emission and a minor effect on *  emission .",
    "another factor that may reduce line - emission is wind anisotropy .",
