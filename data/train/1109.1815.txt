    "the resolution of the thermodynamics of interacting systems at very low temperatures starting from first principles is an aged endeavour that has even attracted the attention of great minds in the last and present centuries , sparked early by the striking properties of helium@xcite and renewed with the spectacular experiments involving ultracold alkaline gases@xcite . initiating with the crucial experimental and theoretical works by kapitza@xcite , allen and wisener@xcite , london@xcite , tisza@xcite and landau@xcite , that set the tone for the fundamental advances in the understanding of quantum macroscopic systems , and continuing with the most solid theoretical advances by bogolubov@xcite and bardeen - cooper - schriefer ( bcs ) theories@xcite of interacting bose and fermi gases",
    ", a picture has emerged in which it is clear that at very low temperatures and even moderate pressures , certain fluids undergo a phase transition to a superfluid phase .",
    "this phase is envisioned as a fluid with two parts , one a ",
    "normal \" fluid and another , a  superfluid \" fraction that does not contribute to the entropy@xcite . at zero temperature",
    "the system reaches its ground state but remains fluid , being superfluid all of it .",
    "the recent observation of quantized vortices in alkaline vapours of both bose@xcite and fermi@xcite atoms , also confirms the superfluid nature of those gases and , hence , of the attained quantum macroscopic phase .",
    "although a satisfactory understanding of the nature of the corresponding quantum states near and at zero temperature has been made , as mentioned above , and a lot is known regarding general thermodynamic aspects of these fluids , see refs .",
    "@xcite for instance , we would to point out here an aspect that seems to have gone unnoticed and this is the role of the chemical potential as an indicator of the transition to a superfluid state , related to the main idea that the superfluid fraction of the fluid does not contribute to the entropy . despite all efforts to portray the appearance of superfluidity as a condensation phenomenon  la bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , we shall point out a striking property of _ ideal _ fermi gases that serves as an illustration of the main hypothesis here advanced , namely , that the _ condensation _ phenomenon is the appearance of the _ many - body ground state of the particles in the condensate _ , and not of the occupation of a _ single _ particle state .",
    "we insist right away that this hypothesis is independent of bose or fermi statistics , but certainly , ideal bec is included by this identification . of course",
    ", the quantitative details of behavior of different fluids may strongly depend on the statistics and other peculiarities of the atoms or molecules in question , but no so their overall thermodynamic behavior leading to a superfluid phase .",
    "the present article is based on a thermodynamic approach rather than one based on many body quantum mechanics . as a matter of fact",
    ", we lack such a theory to fully back the hypothesis put forward here , and a hope is that these ideas may show the way for finding it . in the last sections we point out",
    "that the present experiments with trapped alkaline gases may be interpreted in such a way as to being a direct measurement of the chemical potential and , thus , may lead to a corroboration of some aspects here discussed .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "section ii is a brief review of general thermodynamic results useful for the following sections .",
    "section iii is devoted to show the relevant role played by the chemical potential .",
    "it is first argued that one can define it in an unambiguous way .",
    "then , using its main definition , as being the negative of the change of entropy as a function of varying particle density at constant energy , we state the main hypothesis that negative chemical potentials correspond to normal phases while positive ones to quantum phases , zero value being the onset of the transition .",
    "a quantum phase is identified as that one in which there appears a _ condensate _ , as defined above , that does not contribute to the entropy .",
    "these phases , for interacting fluids , show the phenomenon of superfluidity . in this same section",
    "we discuss ideal bose and fermi gases and show that , besides the common ideal bec , there clearly appears a phenomenon that may be called fermi - dirac condensation . in section iv , based mainly in experimental phase diagrams of @xmath0he and @xmath1he we attempt to build a qualitative  generic \" phase diagram that obeys all thermodynamic requirements .",
    "the main result is the phase diagram entropy density versus particle density , where one can plot _ isoenergetic _ curves , exemplifying our concerns .",
    "we advance the fact that the transition gas to superfluid in helium and alkaline vapours is remarkably closer to that of ideal fermi - dirac condensation . also , by continuity",
    ", we find that there should be  supersolid \" phases , in the sense that their chemical potential is positive , although we do not claim them to be the same as those supersolid phases currently discussed@xcite . as mentioned , section v is devoted to discuss the results of recent experiments in ultracold gases , in particular , we argue that the density profiles measured open the door for a full determination of the phase diagram , for both uniform and trapped regions .",
    "we conclude with some remarks .",
    "for a pure ( non - magnetic and non - polarizable ) substance and confined by a vessel of rigid walls of volume @xmath2 , all thermodynamics may be obtained from the knowledge of the entropy @xmath3 as a function of the internal energy @xmath4 , the number of atoms or molecules @xmath5 and the volume @xmath2 , namely , from the relationship @xmath6 . since @xmath3 is extensive , one can write @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively , the entropy , energy and number of particles per unit of volume .",
    "thermodynamics is obtained from the following expressions that summarize the first law , @xmath11 where the inverse temperature @xmath12 and chemical potential @xmath13 are , @xmath14 with @xmath15 boltzmann constant .",
    "we note that @xmath16 is a dimensionless variable that we shall refer to both this and @xmath17 as the chemical potential .",
    "the pressure @xmath18 of the system is obtained via euler expression , that is to say , @xmath19 thermodynamics assumes that @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 are single valued functions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the second law states that @xmath24 is a concave function of its variables @xmath25 , namely , @xmath26 these conditions assert the stability of the thermodynamic states , the first inequality implies the positivity of the specific heat at constant volume @xmath27 while the second one the positivity of the isothermal compressibility , @xmath28 the second expression is equivalent to the more common one @xmath29 .",
    "the third law asserts that absolute zero , @xmath30 , is unattainable and , if we consider systems with energy spectra unbounded from above , one concludes that the temperature is always positive , @xmath31@xcite",
    ". the laws are silent regarding the sign of the chemical potential @xmath16 .",
    "we shall argue that there is a profound meaning in the sign of this quantity , typically being negative , while its becoming positive signals the appearance of  quantum \" fluid phases .",
    "but before getting into that aspect , let us review briefly the characteristics of first and second order phase transitions .",
    "phase transitions only occur in the thermodynamic limit , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5 become infinitely large , while the densities @xmath20 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 remain finite . at a first order phase transition",
    "the ( originally ) extensive quantities @xmath20 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 become discontinuous while the intensive ones , @xmath21 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 remain continuous",
    ". a phase transition of the second order occurs with a continuous change of all variables , @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath21 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 , however , the state is strictly unstable in the sense that the stability conditions of the second law , eqs.([c2 ] ) , are no longer negative but become zero .",
    "that is , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . or , equivalently , @xmath34 and @xmath35 at the transition .",
    "by well known relationships of statistical physics@xcite , the former indicates a divergence of the density energy fluctuations , while the latter a divergence of the particle density fluctuations .",
    "thus , in the strict thermodynamic limit , a system can not be stabilized at a second order phase transition . for our purposes below",
    ", a second order phase transition implies that both the pressure @xmath18 and the chemical potential @xmath16 , as functions of @xmath23 for a given value of the temperature @xmath21 , become flat at the transition .    with the previous information plus empirical data regarding the overall characteristics of the phase diagram of the equation of state @xmath36",
    "one can construct the structure of the fundamental relationship @xmath24 .",
    "we stress out the important fact that the equation of state @xmath36 is not a fundamental relationship in the sense that not all the thermodynamics can be obtained from its knowledge .",
    "one needs an additional function , such as @xmath37 .",
    "however , @xmath24 is fundamental since it does contain all thermodynamics .",
    "as mentioned above , the sign of the chemical potential @xmath16 is not restricted by the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "moreover , there is a widespread belief that the chemical potential is defined up to an arbitrary additive constant .",
    "thus , enquiring about its sign and the meaning of it , may appear as a futile exercise .",
    "we now argue that such a belief is not correct and establish that the sign of the chemical potential is of fundamental relevance .",
    "an alternative determination of the chemical potential to that of eq.([c1 ] ) is the following , @xmath38 this identity follows from the uniqueness of @xmath20 as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the argument of the indeterminacy of @xmath16 is that since the system is non - relativistic , the energy @xmath4 can be defined up to an arbitrary constant @xmath39 thus shifting its origin arbitrarily , @xmath40 , and because of eq.([cp2 ] ) , yielding a chemical potential relative to such an arbitray origin of the energy .",
    "let us review this carefully .",
    "first , since the thermodynamic limit must be imposed , clearly , an arbitrary constant @xmath39 would drop out since @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the arbitrary constant should be extensive , that is , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 indeed an arbitrary constant .",
    "this would certainly imply @xmath44 .",
    "we now argue that the constant @xmath43 can always be ( as it is done in practice ) set equal to zero .",
    "consider a realistic model of a pure fluid .",
    "it is first assumed to be non - relativistic .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of @xmath5 atoms ( or molecules ) , classical or quantum , may be written as , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the common confining potential , and here we are concerned with rigid - walls potentials only .",
    "the interatomic potential is @xmath47 and can contain two- , three- , etc .",
    ", body interactions . this potential can be defined , again , up to an arbitrary constant . however , for the energy @xmath4 to be extensive , it should be true that in the limit of  infinite dilution \" , namely , in the limit @xmath48 for all pairs of particles @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the system , the potential should take the form @xmath51 . in all textbooks",
    "is assumed that the arbitrary constant is zero , @xmath52 .",
    "that is , one always tacitly assume that in such a limit the system behaves as an _ ideal _ gas ( quantum or classical ) .",
    "we shall take this point of view here .",
    "this means that the energy is uniquely defined and so does the chemical potential @xmath16 . with regard to this common convention",
    ", we can establish the meaning of the sign of @xmath16 .",
    "recall the definition of the chemical potential , eq.([c1 ] ) .",
    "it gives the negative of the change of entropy with respect to a change of particles , for a given value of the energy .",
    "thus , if negative ( positive ) , it tells us that the entropy increases ( decreases ) with increasing number of particles , for a fixed value of the energy .",
    "we now resort to the well - known recipe from statistical physics@xcite to calculate the entropy of an open system in interaction with a heat bath , in terms of its ( average ) energy @xmath4 , number of particles @xmath5 and volume @xmath2 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of states the system has access when in thermal equilibrium with its environment .",
    "this number of states is defined within an interval @xmath55 , the energy fluctuation of the thermodynamic state , namely , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the density of states . for a fixed value of the energy @xmath4 and the volume @xmath2 ,",
    "the statistical weight @xmath58 is a function of the number of particles .    to elucidate the dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath23 ,",
    "let us consider a gas at large enough temperatures such that the system may well be approximated as classical and even close to an ideal gas .",
    "let us keep the energy @xmath22 fixed at that corresponding value .",
    "then , it should be clear , and textbook experience corroborates it , that if the number of particles is increased the number of available states does too increase . that is , there is an increase of available states by enlarging the phase space with more particles .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath16 is thus negative .",
    "one finds , however , that the energy per particle @xmath59 obviously decreases and , at the same time , not completely obvious but corroborated by simple cases and verified below , the temperature @xmath60 also _ decreases_. it is important to realize that as the number of particles is increased , the structure of the states and of the energy spectrum do change , that is , the system is described by a different hamiltonian , since this depends on @xmath5 .",
    "consider now that the energy is still kept constant but the number of particles keeps increasing even further .",
    "two situations may occur :    \\i ) the system reaches a _ limiting _ state of finite temperature .",
    "that is , the system reaches a state where if the number of particles is increased even more , the energy can no longer be kept constant .",
    "that is , the system must suffer a first order phase transition , the temperature , pressure and chemical potential changing continuously , but the energy and entropy becoming discontinuous , typically increasing . in brief , the isoenergetic curves eventually meet a state that borders an unstable region , where phase separation occurs , but the important point is that the chemical potential is always negative @xmath61 since , in this case , entropy is an increasing function of @xmath23 .",
    "we call  normal \" to these states .",
    "\\ii ) the system reaches the _ limiting _ state of zero temperature .",
    "this case may occur because the energy spectrum of the many - body system is bounded from below by the ground state energy @xmath62 .",
    "thus , for a fixed value of the energy @xmath22 , there exists a _",
    "maximum _ value of the density @xmath63 at which the energy of the ground state of that density equals the energy @xmath22 , namely , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 . at this stage",
    "the system is in its _ corresponding _ ground state , the entropy becomes zero @xmath66 and so does the temperature @xmath67 .",
    "since at low enough density the entropy increases with increasing density but eventually reaches @xmath68 for @xmath63 , it follows that the entropy must have reached a maximum value at some critical density @xmath69 , above which the entropy begins to decrease .",
    "this in turn implies that the chemical potential is negative for small enough density , becoming zero at @xmath70 and turning into a positive quantitive above it .",
    "we shall argue further below that this change signals the appearance of , or transition to , a quantum fluid or a quantum solid with proper macroscopic properties .",
    "let us advance a hypothesis of the nature of that state that explains the decrease of the entropy at the point @xmath71 .      as mentioned above , if for a fixed value of the energy the system reaches a limiting state at zero temperature , which in turn is the ground state for that density",
    ", it must be true that in the vicinity of that state the chemical potential must be positive indicating that the entropy _ decreases _ with increasing density .",
    "this implies that at some density @xmath69 the chemical potential becomes zero @xmath72 .",
    "one can conclude that as this point is crossed by increasing the density , a macroscopic phase nucleates such that it does not contribute to the entropy .",
    "to have such a property , this phase must be a _",
    "single _ many - body quantum state . as we shall analyze below ,",
    "this coincides with the appearance of superfluid phases in he and alkaline ultracold vapors . for a bose ideal gas ,",
    "this is also the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "what we further claim here , as the main hypothesis of this study , is that this phase must be very close to the many - body ground state of the fraction of the particles that conforms such a phase .",
    "let @xmath73 be the fraction of particles ( per unit volume ) in the zero - entropy phase and @xmath74 the remaining ones .",
    "thus , we claim , the zero - entropy phase is the many - body ground state of the @xmath73 particles with energy @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 . as the number of particles is increased , @xmath73 increases up to the point where @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and the whole system is in its corresponding ground state .",
    "the entropy and the temperature are zero .",
    "we immediately point out that this _ is not _ the usual bose - einstein condensation scenario .",
    "in such a case the condensation occurs at a _ single_-particle state . here",
    ", we insist in the fact that the condensate is the _ many - body _ ground state of the condensate particles . of course , the many - body ground state of @xmath73 particles per unit volume in the ideal bose gas is the same as @xmath73 particles per unit volume in the ground state of _ one _ particle .",
    "we discuss now that the most common case of condensation of a _ many - body _ ground state is already present in the ideal fermi gas and that this is actually closer to the scenario of real superfluids .",
    "it is common knowledge that bose - einstein condensation in ideal gases is a phenomenon characteristic of bose statistics only .",
    "here we argue that as a matter of fact , the phenomenon of condensation , understood as the development of a quantum phase that decreases the entropy of the system and characterized by a positive chemical potential , is also present in ideal fermi - dirac gases . in figs .",
    "[ fig3a ] and [ fig3b ] we show the entropy @xmath20 as a function of the density @xmath23 for fixed values of the energy @xmath22 , for ideal gases@xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] is for fermi and fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] for bose statistics .",
    "both curves begin , at very low density , with chemical potential negative . at some density @xmath69",
    "both curves reach a maximum and the chemical potential @xmath16 becomes zero . for bosons",
    "this is the onset of the well known phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation , and beyond this point the chemical potential remains zero .",
    "the interpretation is that the _ single particle _ ground state begins to be macroscopically occupied .",
    "that is , at fixed energy , for any given value of the density @xmath79 , there is a fraction @xmath80 that occupies the single - particle ground state .",
    "we note , however , that such a state is also the many body ground state of the @xmath73 particles .",
    "moreover , the energy of the system equals that of the critical density @xmath81 since the condensate has zero energy . for fermions ,",
    "the zero chemical potential point is essentially ignored in most textbook discussions .",
    "we argue now that this also marks the onset of a phenomenon that may also be called fermi - dirac condensation .",
    "the condensation is not the macroscopic occupation of a single - particle state but rather of a many - body ground state , that of the condensed fraction .    from fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] we see that , at fixed energy , the entropy reaches a maximum at a density value @xmath69 where the chemical potential becomes zero . beyond this point",
    "the chemical potential becomes positive indicating a decrease of the entropy .",
    "what does occur in the gas ?",
    "a macroscopic occupation of a single - particle state is forbidden by fermi statistics .",
    "however , we argue , there appears a  condensate \" fraction which is in a _",
    "single many body _ state in order to give a zero contribution to the entropy .",
    "this condensate grows a @xmath23 is increased thus decreasing the entropy .",
    "this behavior continues up to a maximum value @xmath63 where the entropy is zero and where _ all _ the gas is in its corresponding many body ground state .",
    "the latter state has an energy @xmath82 .",
    "note that at this point @xmath83 , @xmath30 but the ratio @xmath84 equals the so - called fermi energy @xmath85 .",
    "we argue then , that for values between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , a fraction @xmath73 must occupy a single many - body state that does not contribute to the entropy . by continuity in the neighborhood of zero temperature ,",
    "that is , at @xmath63 where all the gas is indeed in its many body ground state , the condensate must also be in its _ own _ many body ground state . to find this condensate fraction we appeal to fig .",

    "[ muvsnfd ] for any value of @xmath23 , that is , it is a universal curve . in analogy to bose - einstein condensation , this phenomenon may be called fermi - dirac condensation for particles obeying fermi statistics .",
    "we repeat once more , the condensate is the fraction of the density that is in its _ own _ many - body ground state . as explained above this state",
    "coincides with the one - particle ground state condensate for ideal bose gases . in the next sections we shall present a generic phase diagram for real interacting quantum fluids that present the phenomenon of superfluidity .",
    "we will see that such a state behaves more like the ideal fermi - dirac condensation than the ideal bose - einstein one .",
    "as mentioned in section ii , the relationship @xmath24 is a fundamental one in the sense that it contains all the thermodynamic information of the system . to construct it",
    "we may follow the recipes of statistical mechanics@xcite and/or resort to empirical evidence .",

    "this result , in addition to the fact that superfluidity is present , seems to be in accord with the ideas presented in the previous sections . that is to say , at some point the chemical potential must have changed sign indicating the appearance of a condensate - superfluid phase .",
    "a very important piece of information is the way in which the transition is made .",
    "if second order , the chemical potential should be flat at the transition , identified as the point where the chemical potential changes sign .",

    "the main difference between the latter and the former is that the slope of @xmath17 vs @xmath23 at the transition @xmath86 is zero , as dictated by the fact that it should be a second order phase transition .",
    "the tail for @xmath100 should become that of an ideal _ classical _ gas , while the corresponding one for @xmath92 should follow that of bogolubov or bcs theories , as the temperature nears zero .",

    "experiments with ultracold gases have the peculiarity that are performed in confining potentials , typically harmonic , that give raise to inhomogenous gases .",
    "it is well established that the so - called _ local density approximation _ ( lda ) yields accurately the density profile measured in these experiments@xcite .",
    "this approximation indicates that the density profile , for an isotropic harmonic potential , may be calculated as @xmath112 that is , the equation of state @xmath113 for the homogenous system is the inhomogenous density profile rescaled by the confining potential .",
    "[ rhovsr - h ] is the profile for an isotherm of the hypothetical interacting system of fig .",
    "[ muvsn - h ] , for a temperature and chemical potential of the confined system below condensation . a very important prediction of the present study is thus found : the point where the chemical potential is zero in the _ homogenous _ system translates to the point where the profile changes behavior .",
    "call this spatial point @xmath114 , then the chemical potential of the confined inhomogenous gas is @xmath115 .",
    "that is , density profiles are enough to construct not only the phase diagram of the homogeneous systems but also of the inhomogenous ones .",
    "the latter follow from the fact that the number of particles in the confined gas is @xmath116 this yields @xmath117 which is the equation of state of the _ confined _ gas as a function of @xmath60 , @xmath17 and the  generalized volume \" @xmath118@xcite ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite where an effort has been made to experimentally construct the phase diagram of a trapped @xmath119rb gas .",
    "although finite size effects may obscure the behavior of the density profiles at the region where they typically change curvature , systematic measurements with different number of particles should help to elucidate this relevant point .",
    "we recall here that building phase diagrams from density profiles has already been performed@xcite , however , the identification of zero chemical potential as the transition points has not been used .",
    "in his celebrated book@xcite on superfluidity , fritz london makes a description of the nature of the superfluid phase that essentially has survived up to these days , and that it is also the main point of the present article although with a twist .",
    "london was impressed by the fact that the superfluid fraction does not contribute to the entropy of the fluid .",
    "he considers the fraction to be a single macroscopic quantum state and he even says that superfluid flow allows to  tap ground state \" from the fluid@xcite .",
    "the further but inaccurate london s assumption is that the superfluid state may be considered to be similar to an ideal bose - einstein condensate .",
    "it is well recorded that landau@xcite argued that it could not be so since an ideal gas can not be superfluid .",
    "few years later , bogolubov@xcite provided the first satisfactory model of superfluidity at @xmath67 , which needed the presence of intermolecular interactions in an essential way . nevertheless ,",
    "since then , many of theoretical efforts and explanations have been prone to describe superfluidity as a kind of bose - einstein condensation in a single particle state , although certainly including interactions .",
    "it may seem , as london himself believed , that bose statistics are essential .",
    "however , we also well know that this is not necessarily true .",
    "bcs - like theories have been successfully applied@xcite to explain superfluidity in @xmath0he , a fermion .",
    "thus , the existence of quantum fluids phases that may exhibit superfluidity is not truly a matter of statistics , it is a phenomenon due solely to the quantum nature of the fluids and to the fact that the samples are macroscopic . of course , the details may depend on the particular fluid , and thus certain properties may depend on being bosons or fermions . and",
    "it is in this regard that the main thesis of this article rests : the phenomenon of condensation is the sudden occupation of certain number of atoms of _ their _ many - body ground state , hence not contributing to the entropy , and reaching the full ground state of the whole sample at zero temperature .",
    "clearly , this scenario includes ideal bose - einstein condensation , but it does appear that ideal fermi - dirac condensation is closer to the interacting case , be it fermions or bosons .",
    "one of the suggestions of this article is that such an observation may be useful in the search of a complete and satisfactory theory of the thermodynamics of quantum fluids .",
