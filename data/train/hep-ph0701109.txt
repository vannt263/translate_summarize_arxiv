    "it is then possible to extend the definition of parity of the lorentz group to all particles and ensure that the theory is invariant under the transformation of parity .",

    "it is also possible to break the parity symmetry spontaneously by the vacuum expectation value ( @xmath7 ) of a gauge singlet scalar field which has odd parity @xcite . in either case ,",
    "parity violation at low energy originates from some spontaneous symmetry breaking at high energy .    the simplest grand unified theory ( gut ) that includes the left - right symmetric extension of the standard model",

    "there is renewed interest in the @xmath0 gut stemming from the predictability of the minimal structure of the models @xcite .",
    "these minimal @xmath0 models with the most economical choices of higgs scalars have several interesting features @xcite . here",
    "we show that the possibility of leptogenesis  @xcite can also be accommodated in these models . from an analysis of gauge coupling unification , we determine the scale of left - right symmetry breaking , which is intimately related to a successful prediction of leptogenesis in these models .",
    "an apparent obstacle arises in the following form : either these models do not allow any intermediate mass scales or the intermediate left - right symmetry breaking scale comes out to be large ( @xmath8 gev ) .",
    "to implement leptogenesis , on the other hand , the left - right symmetry breaking scale has to be much lower .",
    "we exhibit several alternate possibilities which may provide a way out from this impasse .",

    "usually a @xmath14 representation is chosen . however , for correct fermion mass relations @xcite , a @xmath15 representation containing the field @xmath16 under the group @xmath17 is often chosen .",
    "the main differences between models i and ii lie in the higgs scalar that breaks the left - right symmetry and the generation of neutrino masses .",

    "there are several interesting features associated with this .",
    "the one relevant here is that the singlet fermions can be almost degenerate with the neutrinos , leading to resonant leptogenesis naturally in this scenario @xcite .    in model ii ,",
    "an @xmath6 triplet higgs scalar @xmath25 breaks the left - right symmetric group @xmath26 .",

    "when the bi - doublet higgs scalar @xmath11 breaks the electroweak symmetry , this leads to the small see - saw neutrino mass @xcite . due to left - right parity ,",
    "there is also an @xmath5 triplet higgs scalar @xmath28 .",
    "although these scalars have a mass at the parity breaking scale @xmath1 , the @xmath7 of the neutral component of this field is extremely tiny and can give small majorana masses to the left - handed neutrinos leading to the type ii see - saw mechanism , explanation of large neutrino mixings through @xmath29 unification , and parameterization of all fermion masses , mixings , and cp - violation .",
    "decays of the right - handed neutrinos or the left - handed triplet higgs scalars can generate a lepton asymmetry at the scale @xmath1 . with high left - right symmetry breaking scale and asymptotic parity conservation ,",

    "the majorana mass of right - handed neutrinos is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the yukawa coupling .",
    "the right - handed neutrino mass - scale controls leptogenesis as well as light neutrino masses and , in particular , a value around @xmath32 gev or lower is favored by the ` gravitino constraint ' discussed below .",
    "since @xmath31 does not affect the experimentally measured charged fermion masses at low energies , one can assign any value to it , leaving the left - right symmetry breaking scale unrestricted .",

    "the main motivation of the see - saw mechanism was to avoid arbitrarily small yukawa couplings , so we shall assume the value of @xmath31 to be of order unity @xcite .",
    "while considering leptogenesis in the minimal supersymmetric @xmath0 guts , the potential problem @xcite arising from the overclosure of the universe by gravitinos ( and its adverse influence on the successful big bang nucleosynthesis predictions ) must be taken into account .",
    "this requires the reheating temperature , @xmath33 , to be less than @xmath34  gev .",
    "since leptogenesis takes place just below the scale of left - right symmetry breaking , @xmath35 can make models inconsistent with the above or at least unnatural .",
    "however , model i may still be consistent because it offers the alternative of resonant leptogenesis .",
    "+    using renormalization group ( rg ) equations , in the following sections we examine for both models whether gauge coupling unification at all allows a low left - right symmetry breaking scale which would make successful leptogenesis viable .",

    "when this field acquires a @xmath7 , @xmath0 is broken to @xmath40 and d - parity is also spontaneously broken ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) . to keep d - parity intact at this level we have to look elsewhere .",
    "the @xmath0 * 210 * also contains a \\{15,1,1 } under @xmath38 which is d - parity even .",
    "this is the field to which the @xmath7 must be ascribed to get the desired symmetry breaking to @xmath10 while keeping d - parity intact .",

    "finally , the electroweak symmetry breaking takes place by the @xmath7 of a * 10 * -plet of @xmath0 . in the minimal models under consideration , there are no other higgs representations .",
    "the simplicity of the minimal supersymmetric @xmath0 gut allows several interesting predictions . with some standard assumptions it is possible to determine the mass scales involved in the symmetry breaking .",
    "below , we shall show that one - loop renormalization group evolution leads to left - right symmetry breaking and unification scales , & & ^0 1.310 ^ 16   gev ,  ^0 2.910 ^ 16   gev . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are already very close .",
    "but , the situation worsens when two - loop rg contributions are included and we find that no intermediate scales are allowed at all below the unification scale .",
    "all this makes leptogenesis unnatural in this class of models .",
    "we suggest some possible remedies .    in this paper",
    "we show that inclusion of gut - threshold effects , gravitational corrections through @xmath48 operators , or presence of additional light fields near @xmath1 , can lower the intermediate scale , bringing it even to the range of a few tev in the doublet model .",

    "the superpartner of the lightest right - handed neutrino in the doublet model may also be a good candidate for dark matter .",
    "one of the most appealing features of the minimal supersymmetric @xmath0 model is that one can calculate the pattern of symmetry breaking and predict fermion mass relations at the gut scale @xcite .",

    "the fermions belong to the representation @xmath140 * 16*. the complete superpotential of the model can then be written as @xmath141 where the yukawa couplings are in @xmath142 and the scalar potential can be derived from @xmath143 . they can be written as ( we follow the notations of ref .",

    "! | + & & + m_h h h + 1 4 !",
    "h  ( + | ) .",
    "[ eq47 ] as usual , minimization of the scalar potential gives the allowed values of the @xmath7 of the different fields .",
    "in addition , fermion mass relations are also determined in terms of the parameters of the model .",
    "it may appear that the solutions presented earlier with lowered left - right symmetry breaking scales are in conflict with results on fermion masses .",
    "however , this need not be the case .",
    "for example , when gravitational corrections are included , there may well be non - renormalizable terms in the superpotential , suppressed by the planck scale , which can contribute to the yukawa couplings after the gut symmetry breaking by the field @xmath144 .",
    "thus , in the presence of such corrections , the superpotential will have to be supplemented by @xmath145 these new interactions will be suppressed by @xmath146 .",
    "but @xmath147 is close to the planck scale , as we have illustrated , and hence the suppression need not be too much .",
    "in addition , the non - renormalizable couplings @xmath148 could also be large .",
    "then the fermion mass relations obtained for the minimal supersymmetric @xmath0 models could be radically affected .",
    "fermion mass relations can also get changed in the presence of new higgs scalars .",
    "thus the low intermediate mass scales , @xmath1 , obtained in the present analysis need not be inconsistent with the fermion mass relations .    at the tree level ,",
    "the minimal triplet model predicts  @xcite masses near @xmath1 for additional states belonging to @xmath37 with the quantum numbers e_l(3 , 3 , 1 , 4/3)_l(3 , 3 , 1 , -4/3 ) , + e_r(3 , 1 , 3 , 4/3 ) _",
    "r(3 , 1 , 3 , -4/3).[eq48 ]    we have checked that with the minimal higgs content , the renormalizable doublet model also leads to similar light higgs scalars .",
    "it has been further noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that these states prevent having parity conserving @xmath10 at any value of the intermediate scale below @xmath53 .",
    "we remark that their presence at @xmath1 sufficiently lower than @xmath53 , apart from being in conflict with @xmath149 and @xmath150 , spoils perturbative gauge coupling evolutions by developing landau poles in the coupling constants in the region @xmath151 .",
    "this difficulty could be avoided @xcite by extensions of the minimal doublet or the triplet model through the inclusion of non - renormalizable operators and/or additional @xmath0 higgs representations , like @xmath106 .",
    "for example , the presence of the non - renormalizable term in the superpotential w_gr & = & ^g ^4 , with @xmath152 , or ( string ) compactification scale , can lift the masses of these light scalars close to the gut scale when the @xmath37 gets @xmath7 along the direction @xmath153 , leading to @xmath154 .",
    "then their contributions are added to gut - threshold effects , as discussed earlier .",
    "in this work , we have discussed the question of low intermediate left - right symmetry breaking scales , as preferred by leptogenesis , in the minimal supersymmetric @xmath0 guts with only doublet higgs scalars as well as with triplet scalars . in view of the presence of additional scalar components predicted from mass spectra analysis @xcite which disrupt perturbativity and gauge coupling unification , the minimal renormalizable triplet model with higgs representations @xmath155",
    "is ruled out as a candidate for any value of left - right symmetry breaking intermediate scale . with the added presence of a higgs representation @xmath156 and/or non - renormalizable interactions ,",
    "these unwanted scalar components are made superheavy and we find , in agreement with previous work , that in the minimal models , at the one - loop level gauge coupling unification requires the scale of left - right symmetry breaking to be close to the gut scale @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the two - loop contributions eliminates even this possibility as no solution can be found at all with an intermediate scale . on the other hand ,",
    "evading the gravitino problem , which would otherwise plague successful big bang nucleosynthesis , would require @xmath157 .",
    "we have pointed out that this impasse can be circumvented in the case of the doublet model by including threshold corrections near the gut scale , including non - renormalizable interactions due to gravity induced planck scale effects , or by adding new light scalar multiplets . in the last alternative , the additional light submultiplets used are present in representations commonly used in @xmath0 non - minimal models , but they are different from those which emerge from mass spectra analysis  @xcite .",
    "these considerations allow the left - right symmetry breaking scale to be low , as low as even a few tev , making it phenomenologically interesting .",
    "the unification scale obtained in the doublet model using the first two methods turns out to be large , making it safe for higgsino mediated proton decay as well as with fermion mass relations . in the triplet model , although threshold effects can easily decrease the intermediate scale , we find a perturbative lower bound , @xmath2 gev , below which the intermediate scale can not be lowered . with this bound , the triplet model with an added @xmath158 and/or nonrenormalizable interactions emerges as a high scale theory of susy @xmath0 description of fermion masses and mixings . in this model",
    "the possibility of meeting the gravitino constraint can be fulfilled provided neutrino masses and mixings are successfully reproduced with @xmath133 gev . with @xmath1 in the tev region in the doublet model , apart from successful resonant leptogenesis with full compliance of the gravitino constraint , the model predictions can be tested through their various manifestations at the lhc and ilc . +   + m. k. p. thanks harish - chandra research institute , allahabad , india for hospitality and institute of physics , bhubaneswar , india for facilities .",
