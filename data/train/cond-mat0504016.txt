    "spin glasses ( sgs ) have attracted the attention of researchers both in experiments and theory as a prototype of complex systems with quenched randomness.@xcite sgs are random magnets in which magnetic ions interact with each other either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically , depending on their positions .",
    "most of theoretical works have been so far devoted to the minimal sg model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ising edwards and anderson ( ea ) model . after a discussion",
    "early in the 1980s , it is now widely believed that a three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising sg model exhibits a sg phase transition at a finite temperature .",
    "large - scale monte carlo ( mc ) simulations presented an evidence for the finite - temperature sg ordering.@xcite subsequently , the critical exponents evaluated by mc simulations were consistently compared with those evaluated experimentally for the ising - like sg compound femntio@xmath0 .    compared to the ising case , the nature of the phase transition of continuous spin systems such as xy and heisenberg sgs",
    "are still poorly understood .",
    "since many sg magnets including canonical sg possess only weak magnetic anisotropy , an isotropic heisenberg sg model , rather than the strongly anisotropic ising model , is expected to be a realistic model of sg magnets .",
    "experimentally , an equilibrium sg phase transition has been established in real sg materials via measurements of the divergent non - linear susceptibility , _",
    "etc_. in sharp contrast to experiments , earlier theoretical studies on the heisenberg sg model indicated that the standard sg long - range order occurred only at zero temperature in three dimensions.@xcite    in order to solve this apparent puzzle , a chirality mechanism of experimentally observed sg transitions was proposed by kawamura@xcite .",
    "this scenario is based on the assumption that an isotropic 3d heisenberg sg exhibits a finite - temperature _ chiral - glass _ ( cg ) transition without the conventional sg order . in terms of symmetry , among the global symmetries of the isotropic hamiltonian , only the @xmath1 spin - reflection ( or spin - inversion ) symmetry associated with the chirality",
    "is spontaneously broken with keeping the @xmath2 spin - rotation symmetry .",
    "indeed , some numerical studies@xcite claimed that the standard sg order associated with the freezing of the heisenberg spin occurred at a temperature lower than the cg transition temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath3 , possibly with @xmath4 .",
    "it means that the spin and the chirality are _ decoupled on long length and time scales _ , although the chirality is locally defined as a composite operator of the spin variables .    in this chirality scenario of experimental sg transitions ,",
    "essential features of many of the real sg transition and of the sg ordered state are determined by the properties of the cg transition and of the cg state _ of the fully isotropic system_. the role of the magnetic anisotropy is secondary which _ re - couples _ the spin to the chirality and _ reveals _ the cg transition in the chiral sector as an anomaly in experimentally accessible spin - related quantities .",
    "the scenario successfully explained the phase diagram under magnetic fields observed by the recent numerical simulation @xcite and experiments.@xcite    more recently , however , some researchers argued a possibility that in the 3d heisenberg sg model the spin ordered at a finite temperature simultaneously with the chirality , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5.@xcite thus , the nature of the ordering of the 3d heisenberg sg , as well as the validity of the chirality scenario , is now under debate . under such circumstances , it is highly interesting to perform further extensive numerical studies of the 3d heisenberg sg in order to clarify the true nature of its ordering . in the present study , we investigate both the sg and cg orderings of the model by means of a large - scale equilibrium mc simulation .",
    "interestingly , recent experiments reported on a qualitative difference in aging phenomena between a canonical heisenberg - like sg and an ising - like sg.@xcite we also expect that the full understanding of the equilibrium properties of the 3d heisenberg sg will also give a valuable insight into these off - equilibrium properties of sgs .",

    "finally , we present a brief summary of the results in section vii .",
    "in this section , we wish to give a background of the present numerical study of the 3d isotropic heisenberg sg .",
    "first , we explain the basics of the chirality mechanism of experimental sg transition as proposed in refs .   and .",
    "then , we explain the notion of the spin - chirality decoupling , together with the crossover length and time scales which play a crucially important role in the chirality mechanism and are also essential in properly interpreting the numerical data .",
    "chirality is an ising - like multi - spin variable representing the sense or the handedness of noncollinear spin structures induced by spin frustration . in frustrated magnets with continuous spins",
    ", the chirality often plays an essential role in their magnetic ordering .",
    "the local chirality @xmath6 at the @xmath7th site in the @xmath8-direction may be defined by    @xmath9    @xmath10 being a unit lattice vector along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "this quantity is often called a scalar chirality : it takes a non - zero value only when the three neighboring spins take the non - coplanar configuration in spin space , while it vanishes for the collinear or the coplanar spin configuration .",
    "the chirality defined above is a pseudoscalar variable since it is invariant under the global @xmath2 spin rotations but changes its sign under the global @xmath1 spin reflections or inversions .",
    "the chirality mechanism of refs .   and takes the following two - step strategy in explaining the real sg transition : the first step concerns with the property of the fully isotropic heisenberg sg , an idealization of experimental sg materials .",
    "the chirality scenario claims that the fully isotropic heisenberg sg exhibits a finite - temperature cg transition without the conventional sg long - range order .",
    "the cg transition breaks only the @xmath1 spin - reflection symmetry with keeping the @xmath2 spin - rotational symmetry .",
    "the occurrence of the cg transition necessarily entails the spin - chirality decoupling .",
    "obviously , such a scenario does not apply to the infinite dimensional limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , to the mean - field heisenberg sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model , in which the spin itself , not the chirality , behaves as an order parameter of the transition . due to the noncoplanar nature of the spin configuration in the sg state",
    ", the sg long - range order trivially accompanies the cg long - rage order , whereas the opposite is not necessarily true .",
    "one should note that , in the conventional case where the spin variable is a proper order parameter of the transition as in the case of the sk model , the chirality , which is given by the multiple of the spin , exhibits a less singular behavior than the spin at the sg transition .",
    "in fact , the chirality shows only moderate behavior at the sg transition of the mean - field heisenberg sk model in which the spin , not the chirality , is the order parameter of the transition.@xcite    in contrast to the mean - field model or the high - dimensional heisenberg sg models , the problem could be very non - trivial in lower dimensions where the order - parameter fluctuation might change the nature of ordering dramatically . at present",
    ", there seems to be no consensus about the lower critical dimension @xmath11 of the sg order , while the corresponding upper critical dimension is expected to be six .",
    "the cg order , if exists , may emerge slightly above , at , or below @xmath11 .",
    "it has been proved that the sg long - range order does not exist at any finite temperature in the two dimensional heisenberg sg.@xcite the numerical domain - wall renormalization - group calculation as well as the mc simulation suggested that both the spin and the chirality ordered only at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "interestingly , however , the estimated sg and cg correlation - length exponents at this @xmath12 transition differ significantly from each other , _ i.e. _ , @xmath13.@xcite this implies that in 2d the spin and the chirality are decoupled at long length scale , the chirality dominating the long - length behavior .    in view of these transition behaviors of the heisenberg sgs",
    ", it appears likely that the principal player in long - scale phenomena changes from the spin to the chirality as the spacial dimensionality is decreased .",
    "thus , the behavior in dimension three is the current issue , which is the subject of the present work .    the second step of the chirality mechanism concerns with the effect of the random magnetic anisotropy which inevitably exists in real sg magnets .",
    "the random anisotropy energetically breaks the @xmath2 spin - rotation symmetry in the hamiltonian , retaining the @xmath1 inversion symmetry only . when the anisotropic system exhibits the cg long - range order with spontaneously breaking the @xmath1 inversion symmetry , there no longer remains any global symmetry degree of freedom to leave the system in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "hence , once the cg order occurs in the presence of the random anisotropy , the spin degree of freedom also behaves like the chirality .",
    "this is the spin - chirality recoupling due to the random magnetic anisotropy .",
    "such an anomaly revealed in the spin sector via the random magnetic anisotropy can be detected experimentally by standard magnetic measurements _",
    "e.g.  _ , as a divergence of the nonlinear susceptibility _ etc  _ , whereas the cg long - range order is difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "we note that in this mechanism the anisotropy plays only a secondary role : the anisotropy certainly reduces the symmetry of the hamiltonian relative to the fully isotropic system , but does _ not change the broken symmetry of the transition_. the critical properties of the cg transition and of the low - temperature cg phase are expected to be not affected by the magnetic anisotropy , which , however , are now directly observable via the standard spin - related quantities .",
    "this chirality scenario predicts that experimentally observed sg transitions belong to the same universality class as that of the the cg transition of the fully isotropic model .",
    "it is thus highly interesting to clarify the nature of the phase transition of the ideal isotropic heisenberg sg .      , while the sg one diverges at a lower temperature @xmath14 . ]",
    "as mentioned above , in lower dimensions , a relevant degree of freedom which dominates the long - scale phenomena might well change from the spin to the chirality .",
    "the chirality scenario expects that in 3d there exists a crossover temperature @xmath15 which separates the two temperature regimes , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - xi ] . in the higher temperature regime ,",
    "the sg correlation length is longer than the cg correlation length , dominating the long - scale phenomena .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the sensible definition of the local chirality requires the development of the spin short - range order of at least a few lattice spacings . as the temperature",
    "is decreased , both the sg and cg correlation lengths grow , but at different rates , so that the cg correlation length eventually outgrows the sg correlation length at the crossover temperature @xmath15 .",
    "an example of such a crossover behavior between the spin and the chiral correlations can be seen explicitly in a certain toy model : see fig .",
    "10 of ref .  .",
    "then , the relevant degree of freedom for the long - scale behavior changes at @xmath15 from the spin to the chirality . below @xmath15 ,",
    "the long - scale phenomena are governed by the cg correlation , not by the sg one .",
    "this is the spin - chirality decoupling expected to occur in the fully isotropic model .",
    "let us discuss in some detail the finite - size effect inherent to the simulation data in the critical region .",
    "the situation here is not simple because the system has two length scales , each associated with the spin and with the chirality .",
    "suppose that the cg transition occurs at @xmath16 without the conventional sg long - range order .",
    "then , the crossover temperature @xmath15 at which the cg correlation length outgrows the sg correlation length should be located somewhat above @xmath17 : see fig.1 .",
    "a necessary condition for detecting the spin - chirality decoupling is that the measurement temperature lies below @xmath15 .",
    "it is , however , not enough . at a temperature below @xmath15",
    ", one needs to probe the system beyond the crossover length above which the spin - chirality decoupling becomes eminent .",
    "thus , a large - size simulation exceeding the crossover length is required in order to detect the spin - chirality decoupling .",
    "unfortunately , the crossover length scale is unknown _ a priori _ , and is to be investigated by numerical simulations",
    ". a natural criterion might be that it is given by the sg correlation length at the crossover temperature @xmath15 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - xi ] . even in the cg ordered phase",
    ", the spin - chirality decoupling might hardly be observable at the length scale below the crossover length .",
    "rather , it is natural to expect that the trivial spin - chirality coupling is observed below the crossover length scale because the chirality is a composite operator of the spin on the short scale of lattice spacing not independent of the spin , roughly being @xmath18 .    in the cg critical region , the chirality - related quantities should exhibit the true asymptotic critical behavior , _",
    "e.g. _ , a power - law singularity characterized by the associated cg exponents . at short",
    "length scales below the crossover length scale , due to the trivial coupling between the spin and the chirality , even the spin - related quantities are expected to exhibit the similar critical behavior to the chirality - related quantities .",
    "namely , up to the crossover length scale , it seems as if the sg order developed as a long - range order .",
    "it is intrinsically difficult at shorter length scales to distinguish such a pseudo - critical behavior induced by the cg long - range order from the true sg long - range order .",
    "hence , it is crucially important to estimate the crossover length scale and to study the long - scale behavior of the system beyond this length scale .",
    "essentially the same argument also applies to the case of the temporal scale . as an example , we discuss here the behavior of the autocorrelation functions based on the notion of the crossover time scale .",
    "figure  [ fig : cross - c ] shows the schematic representation of the behavior of the sg and cg autocorrelation functions below @xmath19 expected from the spin - chirality coupling / decoupling picture . in the long - time limit , the chirality autocorrelation function is expected to saturate to a certain finite value after an initial fast decay , while the spin autocorrelation function is expected to decay toward zero asymptotically .",
    "a comment is in order concerning the transient behavior of the spin autocorrelation function at time scales shorter than the crossover time scale : at shorter time scales , the spin autocorrelation function might exhibit the pseudo - ordering feature dictated by the cg one through the trivial spin - chirality coupling .",
    "this might well lead to a hump - like pseudo - ordering structure in the time dependence of the spin autocorrelation function as shown in fig.2 , which , however , does not persist in the long - time limit beyond the crossover time scale .",
    "this means that , in order to properly discuss the true asymptotic behavior of the dynamics of the model , a particular attention should be paid to the crossover time scale .",
    "we study a classical heisenberg model defined by the hamiltonian , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a three - component unit vector , and the summation runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs .",
    "the lattice is a simple - cubic lattice with the total number of @xmath22 sites .",
    "the nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath23 take the values @xmath24 randomly with equal probability .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed for all the directions .",
    "the lattice sizes studied are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where the sample average is taken over 976 ( @xmath25 ) , 964 ( @xmath29 ) , 280 ( @xmath30 ) , and 32 ( @xmath31 ) independent bond realizations .",
    "we perform an equilibrium mc simulation of the model . in our simulation , we make use of the exchange mc method,@xcite which is also called parallel tempering.@xcite in the exchange mc method , one mc step consists of two elementary updates , a standard single - spin heat - bath flip@xcite and an exchange trial of spin configurations at neighboring temperatures . the latter reduces the slow relaxation at low temperatures with the help of the high - temperature fast dynamics .",
    "the method has turned out to be quit efficient in thermalizing a wide class of hardly - relaxing systems such as sg systems and proteins .",
    "we ensure equilibration by checking that various observables attain stable values , no longer changing with the amount of mc steps : see refs .   and for further details of the equilibration procedure .",
    "our mc simulations have been performed up to the size @xmath31 and up to the temperature @xmath32 .",
    "this could be achieved only by using the exchange mc method .",
    "the numbers of temperature points used in our exchange mc method are 32 for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for @xmath31 .",
    "error bars are estimated via sample - to - sample fluctuations for the linear quantities such as the order parameters , and by the jackknife method for the non - linear quantities such as the binder parameter and the correlation length mentioned below .",
    "in the present section , we introduce various physical quantities observed in our simulations , and discuss some of their basic properties .    in glassy systems , it is often convenient to define as an order parameter an overlap variable between two independent systems with the same hamiltonian . for the heisenberg spin",

    "this quantity weakly depends on the temperature , in contrast to the heisenberg spin variable whose amplitude is fixed to be unity by definition . in the high - temperature symmetric phase , these sg and cg order parameters are essentially equivalent to the associated sg and cg susceptibilities defined by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "a standard finite - size scaling of the second - order transition for the equilibrium sg and cg order parameters takes the form @xmath46 where @xmath35 is the exponent of the correlation length , and @xmath47 is the exponent describing the decay of the correlation function at the critical point @xmath48 . at @xmath49 ,",

    ", we discuss this method first in conjunction with the detection of the standard sg order , leaving the detection of the cg order later . the nontrivial part of this stiffness method concerns with the choice of the boundary conditions employed in computing the stiffness energy",
    ". there could be various choices , and the behavior of @xmath221 might in principle depend on these choices particularly for small sizes accessible in numerical simulations .",
    "the most standard choice is the combination of the periodic and the antiperiodic boundary conditions ( p / ap ) . in the case of the heisenberg sg",

    ".   introduced the `` rotation '' boundary conditions ( rot ) , which imposed a @xmath228 rotation on the boundary spins without flipping the chirality , which was combined with the standard p boundary conditions in calculating the stiffness energy.@xcite such a p / rot combination applied to the 3d heisenberg sg yielded a negative @xmath223 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath229 for the gaussian coupling , and @xmath230 for the @xmath24 coupling , which implied the absence of the standard sg order at nonzero temperature.@xcite    by contrast , matsubara , endoh and shirakura proposed a different choice of boundary conditions in computing @xmath221 , _ i.e. _ , to use the free ( open ) boundary conditions as a reference and impose the rotational - twist to such `` optimized '' spin configurations obtained under the free boundary conditions in which the stress at the boundary is released.@xcite these authors observed that the stiffness exponent evaluated in this way was largely positive , close to the spin - wave exponent @xmath231 , and argued that the 3d heisenberg sg exhibited a finite - temperature sg transition .",
    "the method similar in spirit to the one used in refs .   and",
    "was also applied to the _ xy _ sg by kosterlitz and akino,@xcite leading to the similar conclusion .",
    "thus , the result obtained by applying the free / twisted - free ( f / tf ) boundary conditions , @xmath225 implying @xmath232 , is in sharp contrast to the result obtained by applying the p / rot boundary conditions , @xmath224 implying @xmath4 .",
    "discrepancy between the stiffness exponents evaluated by the different choices of boundary conditions was also observed in other sg models , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the 2d ising sg.@xcite although the authors of refs .   and argued that their `` optimized '' boundary conditions were superior to the other choices , a theoretical basis of such a claim seems not so obvious .",
    "for example , one might make the following counter - argument that one should _ not _ optimize the boundary conditions in calculating @xmath221 : in the spirit of the domain - wall renormalization - group idea by bray and moore@xcite , @xmath233 represents an energy scale associated with the interaction between the coarse - grained blocks of size @xmath50 in an infinite sg sample .",
    "since these blocks are necessarily subject to the strong frustration effect caused by the interaction with the neighboring blocks surrounding them , an optimization of their energy , independently at each block ignoring the inevitable frustration effect due to the interaction with the neighboring blocks , is hardly compatible with the original rg idea .",
    "one may thus argue that , in calculating @xmath221 in sgs , one should _ not _ make the optimization of boundary conditions referring to the particular bond realization of each sample .    concerning the apparent difference of the stiffness exponents arising from the different choices of boundary conditions ,",
    "there generally exist two possibilities : either , ( i ) the observed difference is a finite - size effect where there is a single stiffness exponent for large enough lattices independent of applied boundary conditions , or , ( ii ) the observed difference is a bulk effect which persists even in large enough lattices . in the case of the 2d ising sg , carter , bray and moore",
    "numerically observed that , although both the p / ap and f / tf boundary conditions yielded the same stiffness exponent asymptotically for large @xmath50 , _ i.e. _ , the possibility ( i ) above , the finite - size effect was much reduced in the p / ap than in the f / tf.@xcite for vector sg , there so far exists no convincing evidence which of the above ( i ) and ( ii ) is really the case . in any case",
    ", a practical question we face with is which set of boundary conditions gives a true asymptotic answer from smaller sizes accessible in simulations .",
    "one plausible criterion might be that , among all possible excitations in the system , the one giving the lowest excitation energy @xmath221 , or equivalently , the one giving the smallest stiffness exponent @xmath223 , should be chosen .",
    "the reason is simply because among all possible excitations the one with the lowest excitation energy should be most efficient in destroying the order so long as it has non - negligible weight in the thermodynamics , and would dominate the low - energy dynamics of the model . under this criterion ,",
    "when the different choices of boundary conditions yield different @xmath223 values , the one giving the smallest @xmath223 , or the most negative @xmath223 , should be chosen .",
    "in particular , when one set of boundary conditions yields a positive @xmath223 while the other yields a negative @xmath223 , the one giving a negative @xmath223 should be chosen .",
    "if so , in the case of the 3d heisenberg sg of our interest , the p / rot combination without any optimization procedure should be chosen since it gives the lowest @xmath223 ( negative @xmath223 ) reported so far.@xcite this suggests that the standard sg order in the 3d heisenberg sg occurs only at @xmath12 .",
    "of course , it is still possible that some other type of boundary conditions might yield a still smaller @xmath223 , but it does not change the conclusion that the sg order occurs only at @xmath12 .    it should also be remembered that the types of low - energy excitations generated via a particular choice of boundary conditions is only a subset of all possible excitations in the system : they are basically _ wall - like _ excitations , not including more complex excitations like , say , a `` vortex '' excitation which is possible in the heisenberg sg reflecting the @xmath2 nature of its order parameter space,@xcite or a `` sponge '' excitation which is closely related to the rsb structure of the ordered state.@xcite unfortunately , we have little knowledge concerning what is the most relevant low - energy excitation governing the ordering of the system , and hence , have no well - based criterion to choose one set of boundary conditions from the others as superior .",
    "although we feel that our argument above speaks for a zero - temperature sg transition in the 3d heisenberg sg , it would be fair to say at present that no definitive conclusion can be drawn solely based on this stiffness method .",
    "we finally wish to refer to the stiffness method in detecting the chiral order .",
    "as mentioned , since the sign of the chirality is flipped by changing the boundary conditions from p to ap , the most standard p / ap combination could be used in detecting the chiral order , at least for large enough @xmath50 . in practice",
    ", however , the application of the reflecting ( r ) boundary is more efficient in detecting the chiral order , as shown in ref .  .",
    "the chiral stiffness exponent of the 3d heisenberg sg determined in this way turned out to be positive implying a cg transition occurring at a nonzero temperature.@xcite other authors also reported a positive value for the chiral stiffness exponent both for the 3d _ xy _ sg @xcite and the 3d heisenberg sg @xcite .",
    "matsubara , shirakura and endoh reported a further evidence of the simultaneous spin and chiral transition in the 3d heisenberg sg by investigating the equilibrium spin dynamics@xcite . in order to eliminate the effect of global spin rotations inherent to finite systems , matsubara _ et al _ introduced an artificial global - rotation correction in the spin dynamics of the model .",

    "<S> equilibrium properties of the three - dimensional isotropic heisenberg spin glass are studied by extensive monte carlo simulations , with particular attention to the nature of its phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> a finite - size - scaling analysis is performed both for the spin - glass ( sg ) and the chiral - glass ( cg ) orders . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the model exhibits the cg long - range order at finite temperatures without accompanying the conventional sg long - range order , in contrast to some of the recent works claiming the simultaneous sg and cg transition . </S>",
    "<S> typical length and time scales which represent a crossover from the spin - chirality coupling regime at short scales to the spin - chirality decoupling regime at long scales are introduced and examined in order to observe the true asymptotic transition behavior . on the basis of these crossover scales </S>",
    "<S> , discussion is given concerning the cause of the discrepancy between our present result and those of other recent numerical works . </S>"
