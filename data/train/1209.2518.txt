    "the nuclear mass region with proton number @xmath0 and neutron number @xmath1 is receiving at present much attention , both experimental and theoretically , since it is a region where nuclear structure collective effects of different nature overlap @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting in this context is the interplay between quadrupole transitional properties in @xmath1 isotones and octupole deformation manifestations in nuclei with proton @xmath2 and neutron @xmath3 numbers . on one hand , isotones with @xmath4 have been found as empirical realizations @xcite of the critical point symmetry @xmath5 , introduced @xcite to describe analytically the first order phase transition from spherical @xmath6 $ ] to well deformed @xmath7 $ ] nuclei .",
    "such critical point symmetries , have recently been studied within various microscopic approaches , either relativistic or non - relativistic ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is well known @xcite that there is a tendency towards octupolarity around particular neutron / proton numbers , namely @xmath8 34 , 56 , 88 and 134 .",
    "the emergence of octupolarity in these nuclear systems can be traced back to the structure of the corresponding single - particle spectra which exhibit maximum coupling between states of opposite parity , where the @xmath9 intruder orbitals interact with the @xmath10 normal - parity states through the octupole component of the effective nuclear hamiltonian . when the mixing is strong enough",
    ", the nucleus displays an octupole deformed ground state @xcite .",
    "in particular , for nuclei with @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) the coupling between the proton ( neutron ) single - particle states @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) has been considered as mainly responsible for mean field ground state octupolarity .",
    "the search for signatures of stable octupole deformations in atomic nuclei has been actively pursued during the last decades @xcite . as a main feature , octupole deformed even - even nuclei display particularly low - lying negative - parity @xmath17 states . in the case of stable octupole deformations ,",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath17 states represent the members of parity doublets , giving rise to alternating - parity rotational bands with enhanced @xmath19 transitions among them .",
    "these fingerprints of octupole deformations have already been found in the particular regions mentioned above , but especially in the rare - earth and actinide regions @xcite .    for the sample of nuclei considered in the present study ( i.e. , @xmath20sm and @xmath21gd ) , experimental fingerprints",
    "have been obtained through the observation of octupole correlations at medium spins , as well as the crossing of the octupole and the ground state band , pointing to the fact that reflection symmetric and asymmetric structures coexist in @xmath22sm @xcite and @xmath23sm @xcite .",
    "a recent study @xcite has analyzed the lowest four negative - parity bands in @xmath24sm and has found an emerging pattern of repeating excitations , built on the @xmath25 level and similar to that of the ground state , suggesting a complex shape coexistence in @xmath24sm .",
    "the experimental findings @xcite mentioned above , already suggest that it is timely and necessary to carry out systematic studies of the quadrupole - octupole interplay in this and other regions of the nuclear chart , starting from modern ( global ) relativistic @xcite and/or non - relativistic @xcite nuclear energy density functionals ( edfs ) , with reasonable predictive power all over the nuclear chart .",
    "let us remark that the microscopic study of the dynamical ( i.e. , beyond mean field ) quadrupole - octupole coupling in the considered sm and gd isotopes is also required to better understand the extent to which a picture of independent quadrupole and octupole excitations persists or breaks down for nuclei with neutron number @xmath3 .",
    "this , together with the available experimental fingerprints @xcite for octupolarity in the region , is one of the main reasons driving our choice of the nuclei @xmath20sm and @xmath21gd as a representative sample to test the performance of the different approximations and edfs considered in the present study .",
