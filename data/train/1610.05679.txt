    "the presence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with masses @xmath7 and above at redshifts @xmath8 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is challenging to explain within the context of the standard @xmath9cdm cosmological model .",
    "the problem is one of timescales : if the smbhs form from seed black holes with masses @xmath10 , produced as remnants of the earliest generations of massive stars , which then grow by accretion , then there does not seem to be enough time for them to grow to the observed masses by @xmath11 unless one invokes a length period of super - eddington accretion ( see e.g.  the recent review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "because of this , an alternative model  the direct collapse black hole ( dcbh ) model  has recently been attracting significant attention . in this model ,",
    "the seeds of the high redshift smbhs are not stellar mass black holes , but instead are intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) with masses of @xmath0@xmath1 that form in some of the earliest protogalaxies .",
    "the basic idea is simple .",
    "if gas in a protogalaxy with virial temperature @xmath12  an `` atomic cooling halo ''  is illuminated by a strong external radiation field , then the formation of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath2 ) within the protogalaxy can be almost completely suppressed @xcite .",
    "if the gas is also metal - free , i.e.  if it has not been enriched by metals from an earlier generation of stars , then the end result is that the gas is unable to cool much below the temperature ( @xmath13@xmath14  k ) at which lyman-@xmath15 and h@xmath16 cooling become ineffective @xcite .",
    "it therefore collapses quasi - isothermally , eventually forming a protostar surrounded by a massive accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the high temperature and correspondingly high jeans mass inhibit fragmentation and also lead to gas accreting onto the newly formed protostar at an extremely high rate , @xmath17 .",
    "the outcome of this process is not entirely certain , but the most likely possibilities are either the formation of a supermassive star with @xmath18 that collapses after @xmath19@xmath20 to form a massive black hole @xcite , or the formation of a quasi - star , an optically thick massive core whose centre has already collapsed to form a black hole @xcite . in either case , the end result is an imbh that subsequently grows into a high - redshift smbh .",
    "the much larger mass of the seed black hole in the dcbh model greatly alleviates the timing problem referred to above , since considerably less time is required to grow a @xmath0@xmath1 seed to @xmath7 than to grow a @xmath21 seed to the same final mass .",
    "however , one major uncertainty in this model is the strength of the radiation field that is required in order to completely suppress h@xmath2 formation and prevent fragmentation of the gas .",
    "this is often parameterized in terms of @xmath22 , the specific intensity of the radiation field at the lyman limit in units of @xmath23 , with the minimum value of @xmath22 required for direct collapse being written as @xmath3 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is important as it strongly influences the likelihood of finding a suitable site for dcbh formation within any given cosmological volume .",
    "for instance , @xcite find that varying the value of @xmath3 by only a factor of a few changes the predicted number density of dcbh seeds in their model by orders of magnitude .",
    "more recently , @xcite have argued that the probability of finding a suitable halo scales as @xmath24 .",
    "accurate determination of the value of @xmath3 is therefore important for assessing the viability of the dcbh model : if the predicted comoving number density of dcbh seeds is too small ( i.e.  smaller than the observed comoving number density of smbhs at @xmath11 ) , then the model will be unable to explain the observed high - redshift smbhs .. ]    values quoted in the literature for @xmath3 span a wide range , from @xmath25 @xcite to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "there are several reasons for this large scatter .",
    "firstly , the value of @xmath3 is known to depend strongly on the spectral shape of the extragalactic radiation field @xcite . in part , this is because this quantity is a relatively crude way of specifying the quantities that actually matter physically , the h@xmath16 photodetachment rate and the h@xmath2 photodissociation rate ; if we change the shape of the extragalactic radiation field , then generally we will also need to adjust the value of @xmath22 in order to recover the same values for these rates .",
    "secondly , the value of @xmath3 is sensitive to the way in which the effects of h@xmath2 self - shielding are treated . typically , this is modeled using a simple shielding function that parameterises the results of more detailed calculations",
    ". however , the two functions most commonly used , introduced by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , yield values for @xmath3 that can differ by up to an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite have shown that properly accounting for the velocity structure of the gas in the protogalaxy reduces the effectiveness of self - shielding and decreases @xmath3 by roughly a factor of two .",
    "thirdly , the value of @xmath3 that we derive from numerical models of direct collapse can be sensitive to details of the chemical modelling : the reactions included in the chemical network and the choice of reaction rate coefficients @xcite .",
    "finally , several studies have shown that @xmath3 can also depend on the strength of the x - ray background radiation field illuminating the protogalaxy @xcite .",
    "x - rays penetrate easily into high column density gas and hence are able to increase the fractional ionization of the gas throughout the protogalaxy .",
    "the additional free electrons catalyze h@xmath2 formation via the h@xmath16 pathway @xmath26 and hence a larger number of lw photons are required in order to completely suppress h@xmath2 cooling .",
    "we therefore expect that increasing the strength of the x - ray background should increase @xmath3 .",
    "the studies cited above confirm this expectation , but do not agree when it comes to the strength of the effect .",
    "in this paper we re - examine the impact of x - rays on dcbh formation using a series of simple one - zone models .",
    "building on the work in @xcite , we identify the subset of chemical reactions that it is necessary to include in the chemical network used to model dcbh formation in order to derive reliable results for @xmath3 .",
    "we also examine how sensitive @xmath3 is to the choices made when constructing a model for the effects of x - ray photoionization ( e.g.  the choice of photoionization cross - sections , the treatment of secondary ionization , or the assumptions regarding shielding ) , and demonstrate that some of these choices can have a substantial impact on the values of @xmath3 we derive when the x - ray background is strong .    the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ numerics ] , we present the numerical method and initial conditions used for our one - zone calculations . we also discuss the reaction - based reduction technique that we use to identify the subset of essential chemical reactions . in section",
    "[ sec : jc ] , we explore how @xmath3 varies as a function of the x - ray flux @xmath4 in our fiducial model . in section  [ sec : reduce ] , we apply our reaction - based reduction technique to the results of our fiducial model and discuss the resulting `` reduced '' chemical network that this allows us to construct . in section  [ sec : uncertain ] , we examine a number of possible sources of uncertainty in our results , including the treatment of x - ray shielding and the spectral properties of the incident x - ray background .",
    "we compare our results with those from previous studies in section  [ sec : prev ] and conclude with a brief summary in section  [ sec : end ] .",
    "we model the thermal and chemical evolution of the gravitationally - collapsing primordial gas in our simulations using an updated version of the one - zone model presented in @xcite , which itself was derived from a model originally developed by @xcite .",
    "full details of the model are given in these two papers , and so here we simply remind the reader of the basic features and describe the changes that we have made in order to account for the effects of an x - ray background .    the gas density in the model is assumed to evolve according to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the free - fall time of the gas .",
    "the internal energy density @xmath29 evolves as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath9 are the radiative heating and cooling rates per unit volume , respectively , and @xmath32 is the gas pressure . @xmath31 and @xmath9 are computed using the detailed atomic and molecular cooling function described in @xcite and updated in @xcite . the only significant change that we have made in the present study is the inclusion of the effects of x - ray heating , which we discuss in the next section .    the chemical evolution of the gas is followed using an updated version of the @xcite chemical network .",
    "the only change that we have made to this network compared to the version presented in @xcite is the inclusion of eight x - ray induced chemical reactions that were not previously accounted for : the x - ray photoionization of h , d , he , he@xmath6 , li , h@xmath2 and hd , as well as the double photoionization of he @xmath33 we describe how we compute the rates of these reactions in section  [ sec : xray ] below .",
    "our complete network therefore consists of 30 different primordial chemical species linked by a total of 400 reactions .",
    "we perform simulations with two different models for the spectral shape of the radiation field at energies @xmath34  ev : a @xmath0  k diluted black - body spectrum ( hereafter a t4 spectrum ) and a @xmath19  k diluted black - body spectrum ( hereafter a t5 spectrum ) . following @xcite , we normalize these spectra by specifying their mean specific intensity at the lyman limit in units of @xmath35 , a quantity that is commonly written as @xmath22 . for both spectra , we assume that there is zero flux at energies above 13.6  ev and below the minimum x - ray energy considered ( see section  [ sec : xrspec ] below ) , owing to efficient absorption by atomic hydrogen in the intergalactic medium .",
    "although both of these spectral shapes are highly idealized compared to the spectral energy distributions produced by more realistic models of high redshift galaxies @xcite , they nevertheless are useful for the kind of exploratory study presented in this paper , because they are simple and they allow us to probe the two different physics regimes relevant for the radiative suppression of h@xmath2 cooling in the dcbh scenario . in the case of the t5 spectrum , h@xmath2 photodissociation is the dominant effect and in our fiducial model with this spectrum , h@xmath2 cooling is totally suppressed provided that @xmath36 @xcite , corresponding to an h@xmath2 photodissociation rate in unshielded gas @xmath37 . with the t4 spectrum , on the other hand , complete suppression of h@xmath2 cooling occurs when @xmath38 , corresponding to an h@xmath2 photodissociation rate of only @xmath39 .",
    "the reason for this is that in this case , h@xmath16 photo - detachment by lower energy photons , which occurs at a rate @xmath40 , dramatically reduces the h@xmath2 formation rate , meaning that a much smaller h@xmath2 photodissociation rate is required to reduce the h@xmath2 abundance to the same level .",
    "physically , therefore , changes in the value of @xmath3 brought about by x - ray photoionization actually correspond to changes in the values of @xmath41 and/or @xmath42 that are required in order to completely suppress h@xmath2 cooling .",
    "we account for the effects of h@xmath2 self - shielding using the @xcite shielding function . in order to do so",
    ", we need to estimate the h@xmath2 column density .",
    "we do this using the same approach as in @xcite : we assume that the dominant contribution comes from a constant density core with a radius equal to the jeans length , @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 .",
    "we do not account for any other sources of opacity , as we expect the continuum opacity of primordial gas to be extremely small at the densities and temperatures relevant for our study @xcite .",
    "the photoionization rate of a species @xmath45 due to direct x - ray photoionization can be written in the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the minimum and maximum x - ray frequencies considered , @xmath4 is the mean specific intensity of the x - ray background ( discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : xrspec ] below ) , @xmath49 is the photoionization cross - section of species @xmath45 at frequency @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the optical depth of the gas at the same frequency . in principle",
    ", many different processes contribute towards @xmath51 , but in practice , in the conditions relevant for dcbh formation , the dominant contributions come from the photoionization of h and he , so that @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the photoionization cross - sections of h and he , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are corresponding column densities . in our fiducial model , we adopt expressions for the photoionization cross - sections taken from @xcite for h and he@xmath6 and @xcite for he ( both single and double photoionization ) and h@xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the photoionization cross - section of d is the same as that for h , and that the value for hd is the same as that for h@xmath2 .",
    "finally , for li , we use the cross - section given in @xcite .    in section  [ sec : cross ]",
    ", we explore the impact of using the h and he photoionization cross - sections given in @xcite in place of the @xcite and @xcite values , since the @xcite values have been used in a number of previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to compute @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we adopt the same approach as for h@xmath2 above , and set @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath43 is the local value of the jeans length .",
    "in addition , it is also necessary to account for secondary ionizations caused by the energetic photoelectrons produced by direct x - ray photoionization . the secondary ionization rate of a species @xmath45 can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 or hd , @xmath61 is the direct photoionization rate of species @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the number of secondary ionizations of species @xmath45 per primary ionization of species @xmath62 . to compute @xmath63 , we first make the simplifying assumption that secondary ionization of any species other than h or he is negligible .",
    "this is valid provided that the fractional abundances of he@xmath6 and h@xmath2 are much smaller than those of he and h , which is always true for gas in the regime of interest for this study .",
    "we then have @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mean number of ionizations produced by an electron with energy @xmath66 in gas with fractional ionization @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the ionization threshold for species @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , for helium we have @xmath69 in our fiducial model , we compute @xmath65 and @xmath70 using the values tabulated by @xcite for a mixed gas of h and he .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : second ] we examine how much our results change if we instead us the simpler treatment given in @xcite .",
    "the heating rate of the gas due to the photoelectrons produced by x - ray photoionization of a species @xmath45 can be written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the energy of the photoelectron and @xmath73 is the fraction of this energy that is deposited as heat . in our fiducial model ,",
    "we compute this using the values tabulated by @xcite for a mix of h and he , but we also explore the effects of using instead the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "finally , given the heating rate for each species , the total x - ray heating rate per unit volume then follows as @xmath74 where @xmath75 or hd . in practice , we find that the dominant contributions generally come from h and he photoionization , since at the densities of interest these species are far more abundant than any of the others .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the mean specific intensity of the x - ray background , @xmath4 , can be represented as a power - law : @xmath76 where @xmath77 . in our fiducial model , we set @xmath78 , following @xcite , but in section  [ res : xray ] we study the effects of varying it between @xmath79 ( as in @xcite and @xcite ) and @xmath80 ( the value adopted by @xcite , based on @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that absorption close to the x - ray sources or in the intergalactic medium attenuates all x - rays below a minimum energy cutoff which by default we take to be @xmath81  kev . in section  [",
    "res : xray ] , we explore the effects of varying this default value . in all of our models , we set the maximum photon energy to @xmath82  kev , but we note that as photons with energies close to @xmath83 make a negligible contribution to the photoionization and x - ray heating rates , our results are insensitive to this value .      the strength and spatial variation of the x - ray background at high redshift are poorly constrained . in the local universe ,",
    "high mass x - ray binaries dominate the x - ray emission from star - forming galaxies , and so there is a good correlation between the x - ray luminosity and the star formation rate ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume that the same correlation holds for the earliest star - forming galaxies , that these galaxies are forming stars at a roughly constant rate with a standard salpeter initial mass function , and that the escape fraction of the lyman - werner photons produced by these galaxies is close to 100% , then one can show that @xmath84 @xcite , although this value can change by up to 50% depending upon what one assumes for the shape of the uv and x - ray spectra .",
    "for the range of uv field strengths considered in this study , this expression yields values of @xmath85 in the range @xmath86@xmath87 .",
    "however , it is possible that the number of high mass x - ray binaries per unit of star formation is much higher at high redshift @xcite , implying that the ratio of @xmath85 to @xmath22 could easily be an order of magnitude or more higher",
    ". therefore , in this study we adopt values of @xmath85 spanning the range from @xmath86 to 1 .      as in @xcite , we take the initial gas density to be @xmath88 , a value comparable to the mean density of a virialized protogalaxy at @xmath89 . in our previous study",
    ", we examined several different choices for the initial temperature and chemical composition of the gas , but found that they all yielded very similar results for @xmath3 . in this paper , we therefore consider for simplicity only a single set of values .",
    "our choices are the same as those used in runs 2 and 5 in @xcite : an initial temperature @xmath90 , an initial free electron abundance @xmath91 and an inital h@xmath2 fractional abundance @xmath92 . for deuterium and lithium ,",
    "we adopt elemental abundances relative to hydrogen given by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we assume that the gas is electrically neutral and that the initial d@xmath6 abundance is a factor of @xmath95 smaller than the initial h@xmath6 abundance , so that @xmath96 lithium and helium are assumed to start in neutral atomic form .",

    ", we have re - run our models , keeping most parameters the same but setting @xmath100 .",
    "the results of these runs are plotted in figure  [ smbh_jcrit_lowl ] ; we also include the results from our fiducial model , for reference .",
    "we see that in the runs with a smaller value of @xmath101 , the impact of the x - rays is larger . in the runs with a t4 spectrum ,",
    "decreasing @xmath101 from @xmath43 to @xmath102 leads to a 2030% increase in the value of @xmath103 when @xmath104 . in the runs with the t5 spectrum ,",
    "the effect on @xmath103 is significantly larger , between 50% and 75% for the same range of @xmath85 .",
    "however , if we examine the actual values of @xmath3 we obtain in these runs , we find that in the runs with the t4 spectrum , they are only slightly larger than in our fiducial model , while in the runs with the t5 spectrum , they are actually smaller ( see table  [ tab : jcrit_lowl ] ) .",
    "in fact , most of the change in the behaviour of @xmath103 is not due to any change in the value of @xmath3 ; instead , it is due to a decrease in the value of @xmath98 in the runs with a lower shielding length .",
    "this decrease is a result of the fact that in these runs , we now have a smaller column density of h@xmath2 shielding the collapsing gas , rendering h@xmath2 self - shielding less effective .",
    "when @xmath4 is small , this effect dominates , and so @xmath3 is smaller than in the runs with larger @xmath101 . when @xmath4 is large , on the other hand , the reduced x - ray opacity and consequent increased ionization rate act to offset this effect .",
    "the x - ray spectrum adopted in our simulations is specified by three numbers : the mean specific intensity at 1  kev , @xmath85 , the spectral slope @xmath15 , and the minimum energy cutoff @xmath105 . , but as previously noted our results are insensitive to this choice provided that it is sufficiently large .",
    "] we have already examined how @xmath3 varies as we change @xmath85 . here ,",
    "we explore what happens if we vary the other two parameters .    in our fiducial model , @xmath106  kev , but we have also carried out runs with @xmath107 and 2  kev .",
    "we find , in agreement with @xcite , that our results are insensitive to our choice of @xmath105 provided that @xmath108  kev .",
    "this result is easy to understand . in the density range relevant for determining whether or not the collapsing gas will be able to form enough h@xmath2 in order to cool , the inferred column density of the protogalaxy ranges from a few times @xmath109 to a few times",
    "this corresponds to an optical depth at 1  kev that ranges from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , or a value at 0.5  kev ranging from @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , x - ray photons with energies around 1  kev contribute significantly to the photoionization rate of the gas in the critical range of densities , but much softer x - ray photons do not , as they are unable to penetrate deeply enough into the collapsing cloud .",
    "consequently , the value we derive for @xmath3 is insensitive to the presence or absence of these very soft x - ray photons , and hence is insensitive to our choice of @xmath105 , provided that it is less than 1  kev .",
    "if we increase the minimum energy further , to 2  kev , we do find a difference in the behaviour of @xmath3 , as illustrated in figure  [ smbh_jcrit_emin ] .",
    "increasing @xmath105 beyond 1  kev has the effect of reducing the x - ray photoionization rate in the dense collapsing gas , since the 12 kev soft x - ray photons are responsible for much of the ionization that occurs in our fiducial model .",
    "consequently , we get a smaller fractional ionization for a given @xmath4 , and recover a smaller value of @xmath3 . the impact on @xmath3 varies depending on @xmath4 and our choice of spectrum , but typically , for x - ray backgrounds stronger than @xmath114 , we obtain values of @xmath3 that are 3070% lower than in our fiducial model .",
    "on @xmath85 in models where @xmath115  kev , computed for a t4 spectrum ( dotted line ) and a t5 spectrum ( dot - dashed line ) . for comparison , we also show the results from our fiducial model for a t4 spectrum ( solid line ) and a t5 spectrum ( dashed line ) .",
    "[ smbh_jcrit_emin],width=307 ]    varying the spectral slope while keeping the minimum x - ray photon energy fixed at @xmath106  kev also has an effect on @xmath3 . in figure  [ smbh_jcrit_alpha]a , we compare models run with @xmath79 , 1.5 ( our fiducial model ) , and 1.8 , with a t4 uv spectrum . in figure",
    "[ smbh_jcrit_alpha]b , we show a similar comparison for the case of a t5 spectrum . in both cases ,",
    "varying @xmath15 has a very similar effect .",
    "flattening the x - ray spectrum by decreasing @xmath15 leads to a mild increase in @xmath3 when @xmath85 is large .",
    "conversely , steepening the spectrum by increasing @xmath15 causes @xmath3 to decrease .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that we normalize our spectra at 1  kev and as we have already seen , x - ray photons below 1  kev do not penetrate deeply enough into the atomic cooling halo in order to significantly affect the chemistry of the gas at the critical period during its collapse .",
    "therefore , by decreasing @xmath15 , we increase the number of x - ray photons at energies high enough to penetrate into and ionize the collapsing gas , and hence increase the ionization rate .",
    "similarly , by increasing @xmath15 , we decrease the number of ionizing photons reaching the gas at @xmath116 and hence decrease the ionization rate .",
    "on @xmath85 in models in which we vary @xmath15 , the slope of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "we show results for @xmath79 ( dotted line ) , @xmath78 ( solid line ; our fiducial model ) , and @xmath80 ( dash - dotted line ) .",

    "( b ) as ( a ) , but for a t5 ultraviolet spectrum .",
    "[ smbh_jcrit_alpha],title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]    figure  [ smbh_jcrit_emin ] also demonstrates that the effect that varying @xmath15 has on @xmath3 is relatively modest .",
    "we find the largest impact for @xmath117 for the t5 spectrum , but even here , changing @xmath15 from 1.0 to 1.8 changes @xmath3 by no more than 50% . for lower values of @xmath85 , or for the t4 spectrum , we find a much smaller effect .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the uncertainty in the spectral shape of the x - ray radiation field illuminating the atomic cooling halo introduces at most a 50% uncertainty into our determination of @xmath3 .",
    "this is not insignificant , but is smaller than the uncertainty introduced by our poor knowledge of the appropriate value of @xmath85 at high redshift .      as mentioned in section  [ sec : xray ] , in our fiducial model we take values for the h and he photoionization cross - sections from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "however , other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have used instead the values given in the @xcite compilation of photoionization cross - sections .",
    "we have therefore re - run our models using x - ray photoionization and photo - heating rates derived using these alternative cross - sections .",
    "we find that in practice , this makes no significant difference to the results of our study .",
    "when @xmath4 is large , we obtain slightly larger values for @xmath3 if we use the @xcite cross - sections , but the difference is extremely small , @xmath118% .",
    "when @xmath4 is small , the difference is likely even smaller , but as our iterative approach only determines @xmath3 to within 0.2% , we can not actually measure it reliably . in both cases ,",
    "the uncertainty introduced is tiny compared with many of the other uncertainties in the model , and it is therefore safe to neglect it .",
    "the reason that varying the h photoionization cross - section makes so little difference to the outcome becomes clear if we compare the exact expression for @xmath53 given in @xcite with the analytical fit given in @xcite .",
    "the two expressions agree extremely well over the whole of the energy range relevant for our study , differing by no more than about 0.2% , and so regardless of which prescription we adopt , we end up with almost exactly the same hydrogen photoionization rate .",
    "the case of helium , however , is a little more interesting .",
    "the cross - section for he photoionization given by @xcite differs from that in @xcite by around 1020% at the energies of interest .",
    "we might therefore expect the he photoionization rate to differ by a similar amount , but in practice it does not ; instead , the difference is only @xmath119% .",
    "the reason for this is that although reducing the he photoionization cross - section decreases the probability of a given x - ray photon being absorbed by he , it also decreases the optical depth of the gas , for the same reason .",
    "therefore more x - ray photons are able to reach the gas at number densities @xmath120@xmath121 , the behaviour of which determines whether or not direct collapse occurs .",
    "this increased number of photons largely offsets the decreased absorption probability , and the result is that the he photoionization rate barely changes .",
    "consequently , changing the he photoionization cross - section from the @xcite prescription to the @xcite fit has almost no effect on the ionization state of the gas and hence no effect on the value of @xmath3 .    finally , it is important to note that the fact that our results are insensitive to small changes in @xmath53 and @xmath54 does not imply that they are insensitive to large changes in these values .",
    "for example , if we use the expression for @xmath54 given in @xcite , which is not intended for use at x - ray energies , then we will dramatically overestimate the he photoionization rate and hence will also overestimate @xmath3 ( see e.g.  the discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .      in our fiducial model",
    ", we treat the effects of secondary ionization using values tabulated by @xcite for a mix of h and he .",
    "however , many studies of the effects of x - rays at high redshift instead use the simple fitting functions given in @xcite , which are based on calculations carried out using older atomic data and which assume that the x - ray photons have energies @xmath122  ev . we have therefore examined how sensitive our results are to this simplification .",
    "we find that if we use the @xcite fitting functions in place of the @xcite values , we recover values for @xmath3 that are between 35% higher for x - ray field strengths @xmath104 .",
    "the shift towards higher values occurs because the @xcite fitting functions predict that more of the x - ray energy goes into ionization and less into excitation of h or he , or into heat .",
    "however , the difference with the @xcite results is small for the photon energies relevant here , and so the impact on @xmath3 is also small .",
    "recombination of an he@xmath6 ion directly into its ground state produces a photon capable of ionizing either hydrogen or helium , while recombination of the same ion into an excited state produces a photon capable of ionizing hydrogen ( but not helium ) with a probability ranging from 66% at high electron densities ( @xmath123 ) to 96% at low electron densities ( @xmath124 ) @xcite . in our fiducial model",
    ", we account for these additional ionizing photons as part of our on - the - spot approximation , and also account for the fact that as some of the photons produced by he@xmath6 recombination into the ground state are absorbed by hydrogen , not helium , the effective he@xmath6 recombination rate lies somewhere in between case a and case b. however , it is unclear whether this level of detail is actually necessary in order to accurately determine @xmath3 .",
    "we have therefore carried out additional runs in which we set the he@xmath6 recombination rate to either the case a or the case b rate and neglect any h ionizing photons produced by he@xmath6 recombination .",
    "( note that we adopt the case b rate for h@xmath6 recombination throughout , as we have already established that @xmath3 is highly sensitive to the choice of h@xmath6 recombination rate coefficient ",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "we find that in practice , our results do not depend on how we treat he@xmath6 recombination .",
    "we obtain extremely similar values for @xmath3 regardless of whether we adopt the case a rate , the case b rate , or the more accurate treatment described above . to help us understand why this is the case , we have examined the rates of the reactions responsible for forming and destroying he@xmath6 in the density range relevant for determining @xmath3 , @xmath120@xmath121 .",
    "we find that because of the low fractional ionization at these densities , he@xmath6 recombination is not the main process responsible for removing he@xmath6 ions from the gas . instead ,",
    "the removal of he@xmath6 is dominated by charge transfer with atomic hydrogen , @xmath125 consequently , even fairly large changes in the he@xmath6 recombination rate have only a very small influence on the he@xmath6 abundance , and hence on the contribution that he@xmath6 makes towards the total fractional ionization . as a result of this , changing the he@xmath6 recombination rate has almost no influence on the h@xmath2 formation rate , and hence almost no influence on @xmath3 .",
    "the influence of x - rays on the value of @xmath3 has previously been investigated in studies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . however , as noted by @xcite , in their original study @xcite adopted the approximate helium photoionization cross - section given in @xcite , which is 12 orders of magnitude too large for photon energies of a few kev .",
    "therefore , although their paper is important as it was the first one to point out the potential importance of x - ray ionization for the direct collapse black hole scenario , their numerical results for the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath4 are incorrect . for this reason , we do not compare our results with their study , but instead restrict our attention to the more recent studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite examine the effects of hard x - rays , with a minimum energy of 2  kev , within their 3d simulations of direct collapse black hole formation .",
    "they find that even large x - ray fluxes have a relatively small impact on @xmath3 , increasing it by roughly a factor of 2 for @xmath126 and a factor of 4 for @xmath127 . for comparison , in our fiducial model , @xmath128 and @xmath25 for the same two values of the x - ray background field strength .",
    "some of the difference between the two models is due to the fact that they ignore x - ray photons at energies below 2  kev , since these actually dominate the photoionization at the relevant densities .",
    "however , this does not completely explain the difference : if we compare our results from runs with @xmath129  kev ( see section  [ res : xray ] ) with their results , we see that our one - zone model still predicts roughly a factor of two larger impact on @xmath3 than they find in their 3d runs .",
    "it is unclear why this difference exists , but it is possible that it reflects a systematic difference between the effectiveness of x - rays in one - zone models compared to 3d models . in this context",
    ", it is interesting to note that @xcite also examine the case where @xmath115  kev and recover values for @xmath103 at @xmath126 and 1 that agree well with our results and disagree with the @xcite results .",
    "ultimately , additional 3d simulations of dcbh formation in the presence of x - rays will likely be needed in order to understand the cause of this discrepancy .     as a function of @xmath85 , plotted for our fiducial t5 model ( solid line ) , the @xcite model with a t5 spectrum ( dashed line ) and a modification of our model in which we set the shielding length to @xmath100 to better match the procedure used in @xcite s study .",
    "note that the difference between @xcite s results at very small @xmath4 and our own is due to the fact that their fitting function does not accurately represent their results for @xmath130 : in their one - zone models , they find that @xmath131 here , in good agreement with our results .",
    "[ smbh_jcrit_it],width=307 ]    turning to the study by @xcite , we begin by noting that they do not consider the case of a t4 spectrum , so we can not compare our results with theirs for that case .",
    "however , they do carry out runs with a t5 spectrum ( and also spectra with @xmath132 and @xmath133  k ) . in figure  [ smbh_jcrit_it ]",
    ", we compare the results from our fiducial t5 model ( solid line ) to the values predicted by the fitting function given by @xcite for the t5 case .. ] we see that @xcite find values of @xmath103 that are roughly a factor of two larger than ours when @xmath4 is large .",
    "there is also a small discrepancy when @xmath4 is very small , but this simply reflects the fact that their fitting function overestimates @xmath3 slightly when @xmath134 compared to their one - zone results ( see e.g. figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "much of the difference between the results from @xcite at large @xmath4 and those from our fiducial model is due to the different assumptions we make regarding the shielding length . in our fiducial model , we assume that @xmath135 , whereas in their model , @xcite assume that @xmath100 . as we have already seen in section  [ shield ]",
    ", this difference has a significant effect on the value of @xmath3 .",
    "if we compare their results with those from a run in which we also set @xmath100 ( the dot - dashed line in figure  [ smbh_jcrit_it ] ) , we find much better agreement , with a maximum difference of around 20% when @xmath127 .",
    "this remaining difference is likely due to differences in the chemical model used in the different simulations : as we have already seen in @xcite , differences in network design and the choice of chemical rate coefficients can easily introduce uncertainties of this size or larger into @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the impact of a soft x - ray background on the strength of the uv radiation field required in order to suppressed h@xmath136 formation in an atomic cooling halo , thereby allowing for direct collapse black hole formation to occur .",
    "we confirm the earlier results of @xcite that the x - rays have a significant effect on the value of @xmath3 for x - ray field strengths @xmath137 and that in the limit of large @xmath85 , the critical uv field strength scales as @xmath138 .",
    "however , we recover values of @xmath139 ( the value in the absence of an x - ray background ) that are up to a factor of two smaller than those reported by @xcite . this difference is largely due to the different assumptions we make regarding the amount of shielding against x - ray photoionization provided by the gas within the atomic cooling halo : we adopt a shielding length @xmath140 , whereas @xcite adopt a value a factor of two smaller , @xmath141 . this sensitivity to the adopted shielding prescription",
    "emphasizes the need for the effect of x - rays to be re - examined in 3d studies that can accurately account for the true 3d gas distribution , but this lies outside of the scope of the present study .",
    "we have also used the reaction - based reduction technique developed by @xcite and first applied to dcbh formation by @xcite to identify the minimum subset of reactions needed to accurately determine @xmath3 from simulations of the kind carried out here .",
    "this minimum subset consists of all 26 of the reactions in the reduced network of @xcite , plus an additional 9 reactions that are required when @xmath142 .",
    "finally , we have carefully examined a number of possible sources of uncertainty in the modelling of the x - ray background and its effect on the collapsing gas .",
    "we show that the results we recover for @xmath3 are independent of our choice of parameterization for the h and he photoionization cross - sections , provided we choose fits that are appropriate for use at x - ray energies .",
    "our results are also independent of the accuracy of our treatment of he@xmath6 recombination , as in practice , charge transfer with atomic hydrogen is a more important loss route for he@xmath6 in the physical conditions of interest . we also demonstrate that @xmath3 is only very weakly dependent on the prescription used to treat secondary ionization .",
    "on the other hand , we demonstrate that our results are quite sensitive to the way in which shielding by neutral hydrogen and helium elsewhere in the halo is accounted for , as already noted above .",
    "in addition , the values of @xmath3 we recover depend on the slope assumed for the x - ray background , although varying the spectral index from @xmath143 to @xmath80 alters @xmath3 by at most 50% in the limit of large @xmath4 .",
    "finally , our results are independent of the low energy cutoff chosen for the x - ray spectrum , @xmath105 , provided this is less than 1  kev . however , increasing it above 1  kev leads to a substantial decrease in the values we obtain for @xmath3 when @xmath4 is large .",
