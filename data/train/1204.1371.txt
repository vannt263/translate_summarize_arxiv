    "the recent discovery of a cloud moving towards the galactic center @xcite creates a potential opportunity for testing models of sgr  a*. the @xmath7 cloud will interact strongly with gas near nominal pericenter at @xmath8 ( @xmath9 black hole mass ) , and may change the black hole accretion rate @xmath0 . since the structure of the cloud and the surrounding medium are uncertain , possible outcomes range from very small changes in the accretion rate over timescales of decades to rapid , large changes in the accretion rate .",
    "the dynamical timescale at @xmath10 is @xmath11yr , and the viscous timescale @xmath12yr @xmath13 , assuming @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. a hot , radiatively inefficient accretion flow .",
    "after an initial transient phase while the flow circularizes  accompanied by transient emission ",
    "it is natural to think the flow will settle into a steady state .",
    "the settling timescale could be as little as a few @xmath16 , and so the steady state may arrive as soon as mid-2014 . if the resulting flow can be modeled as a steady disk , the excess mass will drain away on the viscous timescale , i.e. the source will remain bright well into the 22nd century .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask how changes in @xmath0 will manifest themselves observationally .",
    "current observations of sgr  a * show @xmath17 jy at 1 - 50 ghz with a nearly flat spectral slope @xcite ; @xmath18 .",
    "the spectral slope becomes flatter and variable at 230 - 690 ghz , with @xmath19 , @xcite ) , which is commonly interpreted as signaling a transition from optically thick to optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "the discovery of polarized emission ( polarization fraction at level of a few per cent ) at @xmath20 mm and subsequent measurement of faraday rotation imply a model dependent limit @xmath21 in the inner accretion flow ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "sgr  a * is resolved by vlbi at @xmath22 mm where interstellar scattering is comparable to the intrinsic source fwhm @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this is smaller than the apparent diameter of the event horizon @xmath24 .",
    "sgr  a * fluctuates rapidly in the near - infrared ( nir ) , with average @xmath25 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is not yet detected at mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths ( @xmath26 , e.g. @xcite ) . in the x - ray sgr",
    "a * exhibits flares with characteristic duration of order an hour and a duty cycle of order @xmath27 .",
    "the upper limit for quiescent state x - ray emission is @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any secular trends in these observed properties of sgr  a*.    one model of sgr  a * that fits most observational constraints is our relativistic accretion model @xcite , where submillimeter , ir , and x - ray emission arise in an optically thin , geometrically thick disk close to the event horizon ; radio emission is assumed to arise nonthermally in a synchrotron photosphere at larger radius @xcite , but is not predicted by our model , which focuses on the inner parts of the accretion flow .",
    "the underlying flow model is a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulation ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the emerging radiation is calculated using monte carlo @xcite and ray - tracing schemes .",
    "the @xmath22 mm flux originates as doppler boosted synchrotron emission from the approaching side of the disk between @xmath29 and the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "our relativistic disk model assumes a thermal electron distribution function , neglects thermal conduction , and assumes a constant ratio of ion to electron temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the model does not produce the observed ir flaring at the correct amplitude , but can with the addition of a small nonthermal component in the distribution function @xcite .",
    "if we fix the black hole mass ( @xmath31 , @xcite ) and distance ( @xmath32 , @xcite ) , the remaining model parameters are the source inclination @xmath33 , black hole spin @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath30 , and @xmath0 .",
    "we fix @xmath0 so that the @xmath22 mm flux matches the observed @xmath36 jy .",
    "the relativistic accretion models are not tightly constrained by the data , but they reveal the following : ( 1 ) face - on models that reproduce the millimeter flux would look like rings and therefore , in vlbi data , have dips in visibilities on fixed intermediate baselines , while existing observations suggest that the ring radius would need to vary to fit the data ( @xcite ; see also the discussion of @xcite ) .",
    "more nearly edge - on models are therefore favored ; ( 2 ) models with @xmath37 that reproduce the millimeter flux have a hot , dense inner disk that would overproduce x - rays via inverse compton scattering .",
    "lower spin , @xmath38 , models are therefore favored ; ( 3 ) the observed source size and flux fix the temperature of the emitting electrons @xmath39 ( @xmath40 the rms size of the source on the sky ) and this turns out to favor @xmath41 models .",
    "the `` best - bet '' model from @xcite has @xmath42 , @xmath43deg , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the relativistic disk model uses self - consistent dynamics and radiative transfer but is not unique .",
    "the electron distribution function is particularly poorly constrained .",
    "it is likely anisotropic , may contain multiple temperature components ( @xcite ) and power - law components , and vary in basic functional form with time and position .",
    "alternative accretion models ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) make different assumptions about the flow and/or distribution function and favor slightly different @xmath46 and @xmath33 .",
    "these models may respond differently to an increase in @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , radically different models may also fit the data .",
    "the model dynamics depends on the initial magnetic field distribution , particularly the distribution of vertical flux through the accretion disk ; models with large vertical magnetic flux ( e.g. @xcite ) are likely to respond quite differently to variations in the mass flux . also , jet models for sgr  a * ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) posit a luminous jet and a comparatively dim accretion disk . again",
    ", these may respond differently to an influx of mass .",
    "how , then , does our relativistic disk model respond to an increase in @xmath0 ? in this _ letter _",
    "we calculate the @xmath22 and @xmath47 mm flux and source size as well as the spectrum that would result for the best - bet model over a range of @xmath0 .",
    "one key question we seek to answer is whether a small increase in @xmath0 would hide the event horizon ( and the signature ring - like appearance of the photon orbit , also known as the shadow or silhouette of the event horizon ) underneath a synchrotron photosphere .",
    "this might prevent detection of the photon orbit by the planned event horizon telescope @xcite .",
    "another key question is whether the increased @xmath0 would make sgr  a * detectable in its quiescent state in the ir and x - ray .",
    "below we describe variation of the flux and source morphology at @xmath3ghz ( @xmath22 mm ) and @xmath5ghz ( @xmath47 mm ) (   [ results ] ) , describe variation of the spectrum (   [ spectra ] ) , and finally discuss which features of the results are likely to be most robust (   [ discussion ] ) .",
    "how do we naively expect the mm disk image size and flux to respond to changes in @xmath0 ? in our model ,",
    "@xmath22 mm emission in sgr  a * is thermal synchrotron emission from plasma with optical depth @xmath48 , near the isco .",
    "the true electron distribution undoubtedly contains nonthermal components ( see , riquelme et al .",
    "models with thermal + power - law distribution functions ( e.g. @xcite ) contain an o(1/3 ) nonthermal contribution to the flux at @xmath22 mm , which hints at how uncertainty in the distribution function translates into uncertainties in the spectrum .",
    "the thermal synchrotron absorptivity is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 is an angle between the magnetic field vector and emitted photon , @xmath54 is a modified bessel function of the second kind @xcite and @xmath55 . near @xmath22 mm , @xmath56 , and",
    "the emissivity is nearly independent of frequency , so @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 const .",
    ", so that @xmath62 for @xmath63 , and ignore relativistic corrections",
    ". then for @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) the source has size @xmath66 and the flux @xmath67 . for @xmath68 the source size is set by the photosphere radius @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( i.e. for @xmath71 , but not so large that @xmath72 so that our emissivity approximation fails ) .",
    "then @xmath73 , and the flux @xmath74 .    these simple scaling laws , unfortunately , are not a good description of the variation of source size and flux with @xmath0 . there are at least three reasons for this .",
    "first , relativistic effects are very important ; for @xmath75 emission comes from close to the photon orbit and the source size is determined by doppler beaming and gravitational lensing .",
    "second , for the best - bet model at @xmath22 mm @xmath76 , so in a turbulent flow there is a complicated variation of the size of the effective photosphere with @xmath0 .",
    "third , the emissivity is not precisely frequency independent near peak .",
    "we therefore need to turn to numerical models .",
    "the best - best model is taken from a survey of 2d models . here",
    "we adopt the best - bet model parameters ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) and use them to set parameters for a fully 3d model @xcite  .",
    "we use the same data set as @xcite , and choose three representative snapshots taken at times when the flow is quiescent ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82s ) .",
    "we then recalculate disk images and spectra for @xmath83 .",
    "the 3d model with @xmath84 is broadly consistent with observational data but is slightly more luminous at higher energies than 2d models ( @xmath85 is lower in the 3d models , and this changes the x - ray to millimeter color ) .",
    "the model is self - consistent only for @xmath86 . at higher @xmath0",
    "the efficiency of the flow is @xmath87 and therefore our neglect of cooling in the underlying grmhd model is not justified . at higher @xmath0",
    "the @xmath22 mm photosphere also lies outside the limited range in radius where @xmath88 , so the flow is not in a steady state .",
    "the images and total fluxes emitted by the disk at @xmath3 and @xmath5ghz are calculated using a ray tracing scheme @xcite .",
    "to estimate the size of the emitting region we calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by taking the second angular moments of the image on the sky ( the principal axis lengths ) .",
    "the major and minor axis eigenvalues , @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively , are related by @xmath91 to the fwhm of the axisymmetric gaussian model used to interpret the vlbi observations .",
    "we use @xmath92 to measure the average radius of the emitting spot .",
    "figures  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] show the variation of @xmath3 and @xmath5 ghz sgr  a * model images with @xmath0 ( based on a single snapshot from the 3d grmhd simulation ) .",
    "evidently modest increases @xmath0 will make the ring - like feature that is the observational signature of the photon orbit easier to detect . for @xmath2 , however , the ring ( or black hole silhouette ) is hidden beneath the synchrotron photosphere at @xmath3 ghz .",
    "the silhouette survives for higher @xmath0 at @xmath5 ghz , disappearing only at @xmath93 . for low @xmath0",
    "the silhouette is also difficult to detect because the emitting region is too small .",
    "+     +     +    figure  [ fig:3 ] , shows the accretion flow image size ( @xmath94 , circle radii in figure  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] ) and flux at @xmath3 and @xmath5ghz as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "different point types correspond to three different snapshots from the 3d grmhd simulation .",
    "the size of the emission region and flux increase with @xmath0 .",
    "the 345/230 ghz flux ratio increases with the increasing @xmath0 ; this is caused by the shift of the synchrotron peak towards higher energies at higher @xmath0 .",
    "the following simple fitting formulas describe how @xmath95 and @xmath96 depend on @xmath0 : @xmath97 } \\label{fitsig230}\\ ] ]    @xmath98 } \\label{fitsig345}\\ ] ]    @xmath99 } \\label{fitf230}\\ ] ]    @xmath100 } \\label{fitf345}\\ ] ]    the above constants are nontrivial to interpret because they encapsulate the complexities of the accretion flow structure and relativistic effects in the radiation transport .",
    "the advantage of the above formulas is their simplicity .",
    "the fitting functions are shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] as dashed and dotted lines .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the relation between two observables , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . the size is a linear function of the flux and increases more steeply at 230 ghz than at 345 ghz .",
    "we also provide two phenomenological scaling laws fitted to the data : @xmath101 }   \\label{form1}\\ ] ] @xmath102 }   \\label{form2}\\ ] ] notice that these fits apply to the best - bet model only . for other @xmath34 , @xmath30 , or",
    "@xmath33 the scalings will be slightly different , although if the source is optically thick the linear scaling follows directly from @xmath103 .",
    "notice that equation  [ form1 ] predicts the change of sgr  a * size by 9 per cent when 230 ghz flux changes from 2 to 2.7 jy .",
    "taking into account observational and theoretical uncertainties this is consistent with the observed variations of the size of the source which increases by a few per cent as the flux increases from 2 to 2.7 jy @xcite .",
    "our model spectra are generated by thermal synchrotron emission in the submillimeter / far - ir bump , and by compton scattering in the x - rays .",
    "the spectral slope of flaring nir emission , and its high degree of linear polarization @xcite , imply that it is synchrotron from a small , nonthermal tail of high energy electrons that is not ( but can be ; see @xcite ) included in our best - bet model .",
    "what are the expected scaling laws ?",
    "again , @xmath104 .",
    "the luminosity around the synchrotron peak is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is such that @xmath107 .",
    "the emission rightward of the mir / nir is produced by compton up - scattered synchrotron radiation . the thomson depth @xmath108 , the x - ray luminosity is expected to scale as : @xmath109 , assuming that x - rays are produced primarily by singly scattered synchrotron photons .    what do the numerical models show ?",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows spectra emitted from the 3d disk model as observed at @xmath110 .",
    "the seds are calculated using a general relativistic monte carlo scheme @xcite .",
    "the nir luminosity @xmath111 , which is only slightly steeper than the expected dependence for the synchrotron peak .",
    "@xmath112 agrees well with the expected scaling .",
    "we conclude that sgr  a * would become a persistent mir and x - ray source ( above the present upper limits of @xmath113 in mir and @xmath114 in x - rays ) if @xmath6 .",
    "this is conservative in the sense that our models are strictly thermal .",
    "the addition of a high energy nonthermal tail would only increase the mir / nir and x - ray flux .",
    "we do not consider higher accretion rate models because for @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) the model becomes radiatively efficient , @xmath117 , and our neglect of radiative cooling in the underlying 3d grmhd model is unjustified",
    ".    finally , notice that the mev flux increases sharply with @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that electron - positron pair production by photon - photon collisions in the funnel over the poles of the hole would increase sharply ( the pair production @xmath118 , @xcite ) .",
    "if this pair production is connected to jet production , it is reasonable to think that a high @xmath0 sgr  a * might also produce a jet .",
    "in summary , we have used general relativistic disk models and relativistic radiative transfer to recalculate millimeter images and spectra for sgr  a * at a range of @xmath119 .",
    "our models predict the following : ( 1 ) if the 230 ghz flux increases by more than a factor of 2 , corresponding to an increase of @xmath0 by more than a factor of 2 , the central accretion flow will become a persistent , detectable , mir and x - ray source ; ( 2 ) the photon orbit , which produces the narrow ring of emission visible in figures 1 and 2 , becomes easier to detect for modest increases in the 230 ghz flux ; ( 3 ) the photon orbit is cloaked beneath the synchrotron photosphere at @xmath3 ghz for @xmath120 , or 230 ghz flux @xmath121 jy ; ( 4 ) the photon orbit is cloaked at @xmath5 ghz only at higher @xmath93 , or 230 ghz flux @xmath122 jy ; ( 5 ) the size of the source increases in proportion to the flux at both @xmath3 and @xmath5 ghz .",
    "we suspect that almost any accretion model for sgr  a * with a spatially uniform model for the plasma distribution function will reach qualitatively similar conclusions , but that jet models may differ significantly .",
    "there are order - unity uncertainties in our model predictions due to uncertainties in the plasma model .",
    "what range of changes in @xmath0 are reasonable ? in our best - bet model the mass at radii within a factor of two of the pericenter radius is @xmath123 @xmath124 , assuming steady mass inflow from @xmath10 to the event horizon .",
    "the addition of even a fraction of the inferred cloud mass to the accretion flow in a ring near @xmath10 would ( eventually ) increase @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath125 . on the other hand , stellar winds supply mass in the neighborhood of the central black hole at @xmath126 .",
    "models by @xcite and @xcite suggest that most of this mass is ejected in the form of a wind , and that @xmath127 to @xmath128 flows inward .",
    "a reasonable extrapolation of these models suggest the accretion flow at @xmath129 has a mass of @xmath130 ; this is comparable to estimates of the mass of the inflowing cloud , so in this case we might expect a factor of @xmath131 increase in @xmath0 ."
