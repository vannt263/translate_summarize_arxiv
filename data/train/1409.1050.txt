    "the field of spintronics , which aims at using the electron spin to store and process information , has triggered extensive interest during the last two decades.@xcite since the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance in 1988,@xcite much progress has been achieved on the spin transport through solid - state systems and a set of spintronic devices were proposed based on organic materials .",
    "magnetic tunnel junctions were fabricated from organic semiconductor and spin injection across metal - organic interface was demonstrated.@xcite a supramolecular spin - valve device was presented by coupling single molecule magnets to a single - walled carbon nanotube quantum dot.@xcite the spin transport properties of the dna molecule were investigated theoretically by connecting to ferromagnetic electrodes.@xcite the spin effects of all these systems arise from magnetic materials and from heavy atoms with large spin - orbit interactions , and are not determined by the organic molecules themselves .",
    "recently , an efficient spin filter was reported by depositing self - assembled monolayers of double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) on gold substrate@xcite or by sandwiching single dsdna between two electrodes.@xcite the electrons are highly polarized after transmitting through the dsdna with spin polarization up to 60% at room temperature .",
    "moreover , the spin filtration efficiency increases with the dna length , implying that the spin effects are dominated by the dsdna and do not depend on the interface between the dsdna and the gold surface .",
    "these results are surprising since the dna molecule is nonmagnetic and has weak spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) that could not support such high spin polarization . until now",
    ", several theoretical works have studied the spin - polarized transport through single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) based on the helical chain - induced rashba soc.@xcite very recently , we proposed a model hamiltonian to explain the experiment by combining the soc , the dephasing , and the double helix structure of the dna molecule.@xcite the results indicated that the spin polarization is significant for the dsdna even in the case of small soc and increases with its length , while no spin polarization occurs in the ssdna .",
    "these are in good agreement with the experimental results.@xcite    the dna molecule is a promising candidate for molecular electronics ( see refs .   for review ) , due to its unique structural and self - assembling properties .",
    "as compared with conventional semiconductors and metals , the dna molecule preserves long spin relaxation time which makes it attractive for building spintronic devices .",
    "meanwhile , it was reported that the dsdna could be a field - effect transistor in the presence of a gate electrode.@xcite consequently , one may ask the following questions : ( 1 ) will the gate voltage affect the spin transport of the dsdna ? ( 2 ) can the gate voltage be used to control its spin transport ? besides , the components in each integrated circuit have different electric potentials .",
    "it is thus important to illustrate how these potentials will influence the spin transport of the dsdna - based devices .",

    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are radius of the dsdna and angle from the electric field to the bottommost ( first ) base - pair ( negative direction of @xmath5 axis ) , respectively .",
    "the spin - selectivity of the dsdna originates from the combination of the soc , the dephasing , and its double helix structure.@xcite moreover , the spin filtration efficiency could be considerably enhanced by adjusting the magnitude and the direction of @xmath2 ( see text ) . ]    in this paper , we investigate the spin - selective tunneling of electrons through the dsdna contacted by nonmagnetic electrodes in the presence of an external electric field , which is perpendicular to the helix axis of the dsdna , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : zero ] .",
    "on the basis of an effective model hamiltonian , the conductance and the spin polarization are calculated by using the landauer - bttiker formula .",
    "we find that the spin polarization strongly depends on the magnitude as well as the direction of the gate field .",
    "the dsdna could be a very efficient spin filter and the spin polarization is considerably large under the gate voltage .",
    "furthermore , the spin polarization exceeds 70% for long dsdna by properly tuning the gate voltage .",

    "the fourth one denotes the bttiker s virtual electrodes,@xcite which are introduced to simulate the phase - breaking processes by attaching each base to a virtual electrode,@xcite because of the inelastic scattering from the phonons and other inelastic collisions with the counterions .",
    "the last two terms describe the coupling between the real nonmagnetic electrodes and the dsdna , and the real electrodes , respectively .    when the dsdna is subjected to a perpendicular electric field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zero ] ) , the on - site energy at each base site will be modulated into following form : @xmath21 , \\label{eq : two}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the on - site energy of the base at zero electric field and @xmath23 is the elementary charge .",
    "@xmath24 is the gate voltage across the dsdna with @xmath2 the perpendicular electric field and @xmath25 the effective distance between the complementary bases .",
    "the phase @xmath8 , being the angle between the electric field and the first base - pair , reflects the orientation of the gate voltage with respect to the dsdna , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : zero ]",
    ". @xmath8 could be changed by rotating the dsdna with the direction of its helix axis fixed . besides the gate electrode,@xcite the gate voltage may also originate from the voltage drop across the left and right real electrodes.@xcite one notices from eq .",
    "( [ eq : two ] ) that the gate voltage tunes the on - site energies harmonically along each strand and introduces disorder within each pitch of the dsdna , due to the intrinsic double helix structure of the dsdna . such modulation will definitely modify the electronic structure of the dna molecule and thus influences its transmission ability as well as the spin polarization ( see below ) .",
    "finally , the gate voltage is chosen to be the order of @xmath26 volt , where the external electric field is much smaller than the internal one produced by the nuclei of the dsdna and will not contribute to the soc .",
    "the current in the @xmath27th real or virtual electrode with spin @xmath28 can be obtained from the landauer - bttiker formula @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the voltage in the @xmath27th electrode and @xmath31 is the transmission coefficient from the @xmath32th electrode with spin @xmath33 to the @xmath27th electrode with spin @xmath34.@xcite by applying a small bias between the real electrodes with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath30 can be derived for the virtual electrodes , since the net current flowing through each of them is zero .",
    "then the conductances for spin - up and spin - down electrons can be calculated @xmath37 .",
    "the spin polarization is @xmath38 .",
    "the values of aforementioned parameters are the same as those in ref .  , i.e. , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , which are determined from first - principles calculations@xcite and the unit is ev .",

    "when @xmath50 , the phase coherence length is @xmath51 , at which the coherent conductance is equal to the incoherent one.@xcite for short dsdna of @xmath52 , the coherent conductance is larger than the incoherent one and the charge transport is determined by quantum mechanism ; for the dsdna of @xmath53 , the coherent conductance is smaller and the incoherent charge transport mechanism becomes dominant , in accordance with previous results.@xcite the effects of the gate voltage on the spin transport through the dsdna can be observed in both coherent and incoherent charge transport regime ( see below ) , and are generic for different model parameters . in what follows",
    ", we mainly focus on right - handed dsdna except for fig .",
    "[ fig : two](a ) , where the spin polarization is shown for both right - handed and left - handed dsdna .",
    "although the gate voltage is employed , no spin polarization could appear also in the ssdna@xcite and in the dsdna if any factor of the soc , the dephasing , and the chirality is absent , regardless of the strength and direction of the gate field .",
    "it is well known that the soc will give rise to spin precession as the charges move.@xcite for the ssdna , the charges can transport from one base to another along only single channel . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian can be transformed into a spin - independent one by using a unitary transformation,@xcite which is equivalent to choosing a space - dependent spin - rotating frame.@xcite in this spin - rotating frame which follows the spin precession , the spin is invariant .",
    "accordingly , the hamiltonian does not depend on the spin after the transformation and no spin polarization could be obtained in the ssdna .",
    "nevertheless , the dsdna presents a fundamental distinction .",
    "there are many channels for the charges to propagate between two bases , and one can not find a spin - rotating frame to follow the spin precession . as a result",
