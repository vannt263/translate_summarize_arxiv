    "the physical nature of underdoped cuprates both above and below the superconducting temperature @xmath3 is still subjected to strong debate @xcite .",
    "the recent experiment of doiron - leyraud _ et al . _",
    "@xcite applying a magnetic field strong enough to destroy the superconducting state established the existence of quantum oscillations and coherent fermi surface ( fs ) pockets for this regime .",
    "by contrast , earlier angle - resolved photoemission experiments ( arpes ) reported only observations of disconnected fermi arcs located in the nodal regions of momentum space @xcite .",
    "moreover , according to both scenarios , there exist charge pseudogaps and no quasiparticle - like excitations in the corresponding antinodal sectors centered around @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the absence of these quasiparticle excitations is signalled by the vanishing of the quasiparticle peak @xmath6 in the spectral function at these antinodal regions .",
    "the pseudogap behavior also reflects itself in the underdoped superconducting phase .",
    "one manifestation of this is the fact that the superconducting gap and the pseudogap behave distinctively as a function of doping : the superconducting gap located in the nodal regions centered around @xmath7 decreases continuously whereas the pseudogap continues to increase as the hole doping is reduced from its optimal value @xcite . such a nodal - antinodal dichotomy is therefore a common trend in underdoped cuprates .",
    "a minimal model for describing the dynamics of the interacting electrons in these high-@xmath3 superconductors is the single - band 2d hubbard model @xcite .",
    "this model has been investigated extensively with several numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization , quantum monte carlo and the more recent quantum clusters approaches @xcite , as well as by semi - analytical functional renormalization group ( rg ) methods @xcite .",
    "several of these works successfully obtain an antiferromagnetic phase in the model near half - filling and the onset of a @xmath2-wave singlet superconducting phase away from half - filling when the temperature is lowered below a critical value @xcite .",
    "these results therefore give further support to the point of view that the 2d hubbard model might indeed capture the essential aspects of the physics displayed by those strongly - correlated materials .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the insulating antiferromagnetic phase in the hole - doped cuprates is quickly destroyed at a very small but nevertheless nonzero doping .",
    "if we approach this phase from a larger doping regime , this suggests that the existing fermi surface should shrink to zero with the corresponding quasiparticle weight @xmath6 becoming suppressed all along the underlying fs at a possible quantum critical point .",
    "it is therefore clearly important to account for the physical effects associated with such a vanishing of @xmath8 at a nonzero doping near half - filling .",
    "this analysis has been initiated in recent years for the 2d hubbard model and its extensions in the context of the fermionic rg framework @xcite . however , since the self - energy effects manifest themselves only at two - loop order or beyond , in order to devise conserving many - body approximations @xcite for this model , one should necessarily evaluate all flow equations up to the same order of perturbation theory .",
    "for this reason , we implement in this work a two - loop field - theoretical rg calculation as a function of doping concentration for some important quantities in the 2d hubbard model .",
    "following previous one - loop rg calculations performed in the 2d hubbard model , we choose to consider here only weak - to - moderate initial couplings . as a result",
    ", we find important indications pointing to the existence of a non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) regime at a nonzero doping , before the @xmath2-wave singlet superconducting instability finally dominates over the antiferromagnetic fluctuations . an important point",
    "we wish to stress here is that this nfl regime emerges from the nonzero momentum - resolved anomalous dimension @xmath9 contribution to the single - particle excitations , which arises only at a two - loop rg level or beyond close to half - filling . in the corresponding one - loop rg flow equations ,",
    "even if the initial values are taken to be reasonably small , the renormalized interactions rapidly flow towards a strong coupling regime in the low - energy limit .",
    "this fact also indicates the importance of higher - order quantum corrections to the full description of the low - energy dynamics of the 2d hubbard model .",
    "our work therefore takes seriously this observation and , for this reason , it represents a step forward in this direction .",

    "the system finally developed a @xmath2-wave pairing instability in the low - energy limit .",
    "this suggests the formation of @xmath2-wave superconducting ground state sufficiently away from half - filling .",
    "this latter two - loop rg result therefore adds further support to the still much - debated existence of a @xmath2-wave superconducting phase in the 2d hubbard model and this is in qualitative agreement with the first results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite within a one - loop rg scheme .    since our two - loop rg results have several analogies with the observed phenomena in the high - tc superconductors , a few remarks are in order .",
    "these materials are known to be mott insulators at half - filling regime .",
    "this unambiguously implies that the strong - coupling regime should be an important ingredient to describe quantitatively their observed properties .",
    "the main aim of this work however was not to achieve quantitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "our objective was to show that even the simplest version of the 2d hubbard model is rich enough to capture some of the main features displayed by those materials . in order to describe quantitatively the experimental results of the high - tc cuprates ,",
    "it is essential to choose initial couplings larger than the ones considered in this work .",
    "moreover , we should also take into account the effects produced by next nearest neighbor hoppings @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to expect that , at least for the interaction strengths that apply to these compounds , the inclusion of @xmath100 and @xmath101 in the hamiltonian should not alter qualitatively the low - energy dynamics of the system . in this sense , it is reasonable to suppose that the cuprates could be potentially associated with a universality class which is well captured by our model .",
    "as we have shown here , even our simple version of the 2d hubbard model already displays some important and nontrivial aspects of the physics exhibited by these materials .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are still some open issues which were not addressed in this work .",
    "how the renormalization of the fs induced by interactions affects the rg flow is still not considered in our rg scheme . in recent years , there has been some progress in analyzing this problem in quasi - one dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "however , a two - loop rg calculation of this effect in two - dimensional systems still remains a very difficult task and , to our knowledge , has not been calculated so far .",
    "another important aspect which deserves future investigation concerns the actual importance of quantum fluctuations beyond the two - loop rg level for this model .",
    "since three - loop rg calculations do not seem to be an easy prospect in the near future , we can nevetherless learn a lot about this question by comparing one - loop with two - loop rg calculations .",
    "one important result obtained here was the certainty that one - loop rg calculations in general tend to overestimate the effect of fluctuations near half - filling .",
    "as a result , our two - loop rg theory yields a better controlled approximation in the low - energy limit for this doping regime .",
    "in addition , our results suggest that the pseudogap phase might be indeed related to a strong - coupling regime in the model . however , like any other strong - coupling problem in correlated systems , it is still not easy to have full analytical control in such case . in other words , there is still room for improvement before one can claim to have a complete theory for the strong - coupling regime of the 2d hubbard model .",
    "however , given our encouraging results so far , we believe our two - loop rg approach could provide a good basis for a complementary view of this important problem starting from a weak - to - moderate coupling perspective .",
