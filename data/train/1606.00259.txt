    "the glioblastoma , also known as glioblastoma multiforme ( gbm ) , is a highly invasive glioma in the brain @xcite .",
    "it is the most common and most aggressive brain tumour in humans . from a medical point of view",
    ", gbm is a fast growing tumour made up of an heterogeneous mixture of poorly differentiated astrocytes , with pleomorphism , necrosis , vascular proliferation and high rate mitosis .",
    "this glioma can appear at any age but is more frequent among adults older than 45 years .",
    "usually , they appear in the cerebral hemispheres but they could also appear in the cerebellum . from a mathematical point of view , they can be considered to have a spherical geometry as it is illustrated in figure [ f1 ] see @xcite . in 1997",
    "p. k. burgess _ et .",
    "_ proposed a 3-dimensional mathematical model that describes the growth of a glioblastoma free of any medical treatment that could grow with no restrictions .",
    "this model provides information about the density change of the tumour in any spatiotemporal point but does not give any information about the case in which some annihilation of tumour cells could appear due , possibly , to the administration of cancericidal substances and hence does not study the dynamics of proliferation - annihilation of gliomas .",
    "it is worthy to say that some bi - dimensional mathematical models preceded the burgess model as the ones formulated in @xcite y @xcite .    in the present work , and taking the burgess model as an starting point , we will formulate a mathematical model that takes into account the action of some cancericidal substances ( as temozolomide and chemotherapy ) and hence the possibility to annihilate or diminish the growth of the gliomas .",
    "our resulting model , in agreement with clinical data @xcite , is expressed in terms of a partial non - linear differential equation that is solved using the adomian decomposition method @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the model proposed also allows to compare the profile of a tumour growing without any treatment with the profile of a tumour subject to treatment , i , e . , our model includes a term that gives the difference between the growth and annihilation of the glioma .",
    "calibration of doses using this model as a basis could result in the lengthening of life for glioma patients @xcite .",

    "adomian decomposition method ( adm ) is a technique to solve ordinary and partial nonlinear differential equations . using this method , it is possible to express analytic solutions in terms of a rapidly converging series @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "the method identifies and separates the linear and nonlinear parts of a differential equation . by inverting and applying the highest order differential operator that is contained in the linear part of the equation , it is possible to express the solution in terms of the the rest of the equation affected by this inverse operator . at this point",
    ", we propose to express this solution by means of a decomposition series with terms that will be well determined by recursion and that gives rise to the solution components .",
    "the nonlinear part is expressed in terms of the adomian polynomials . the initial or the boundary condition and",
    "the terms that contain the independent variables will be considered as the initial approximation . in this way and by means of a recurrence relations , it is possible to calculate the terms of the series by recursion that gives the approximate solution of the differential equation .",

    "the adomian decomposition method requires far less work in comparison with traditional methods .",
    "this method considerably decreases the volume of calculations .",
    "the decomposition procedure of adomian easily obtains the solution without linearising the problem by implementing the decomposition method rather than the standard methods . in this approach",
