    "since the advent of quantum mechanics the description of heavy atoms and molecules , in particular their energies , has been of considerable interest in physics , quantum chemistry , and mathematics . however , as in classical mechanics , an explicit treatment beyond one - electron systems is elusive .",
    "this spurred the development of effective models of large coulomb systems starting with thomas @xcite , fermi @xcite , and lenz @xcite who formulated the thomas - fermi model in the appropriate language of energy functionals .",
    "it asserts that in terms of the nuclear charge @xmath0 the ground state energy of an atom is of leading order @xmath1 . that this is only an approximation was clear since the beginning .",
    "but it was even doubted that the leading behavior for large @xmath0 was correct .",
    "in fact , foldy @xcite claimed a @xmath2 behavior for large @xmath0 based on numerical computations .",
    "scott @xcite offered a refined physical argument yielding a positive , additive correction of order @xmath3 .",
    "the correction originates from the strongly bound electrons which are ill - represented semi - classically .",
    "later schwinger @xcite and bander @xcite gave additional arguments for the validity of the scott correction .",
    "schwinger @xcite and englert and schwinger @xcite even argued for a @xmath4 that can be partially traced back to dirac @xcite .",
    "the question whether the conjectured formula for the ground state energy holds asymptotically for the @xmath5-electron schrdinger theory was left unanswered until lieb and simon s seminal paper @xcite which successfully established the asymptotic correctness of thomas , fermi s , and lenz s prediction .",
    "later the scott correction for atoms was mathematically confirmed by hughes @xcite ( lower bound ) , and siedentop and weikard @xcite ( lower and upper bound ) .",
    "eventually , even the existence of a @xmath4-term , the so - called dirac - schwinger correction , was proved by fefferman and seco in a tour de force @xcite .",
    "these results were extended in various ways to , e.g. , ions and molecules @xcite .    however , from a physical point of view",
    ", it is questionable how these mathematical results reflect reality .",
    "it is expected that electrons located close to the nucleus will move at high velocities , thus requiring a relativistic treatment . already in non - relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "the bulk of the electrons are forced on orbits of distances on order @xmath6 , the electrons contributing to the scott correction even live on the scale @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it is expected that only the latter will generate the leading correction to the non - relativistic ground state energy .",
    "already schwinger @xcite estimated this effect and illustrated that the leading term remains unaffected .",
    "srensen @xcite was the first to put schwinger s prediction on mathematical ground by showing that the leading thomas - fermi term is indeed left unchanged in the limit of large nuclear charge @xmath0 and large speed of light @xmath8 when replacing the non - relativistic hamiltonian by the chandrasekhar ( or pseudo - relativistic ) hamiltonian .",
    "subsequently , the scott correction for the chandrasekhar model was again proved to be of order @xmath3 by srensen @xcite ( non - interacting case ) and solovej , srensen and spitzer @xcite(interacting case ) .",
    "a short alternative proof was given by frank , siedentop , and warzel @xcite . by going from the non - relativistic schrdinger theory to the pseudo - relativistic chandrasekhar theory one observes a lowering of the leading energy correction .    despite the mathematical success in establishing the large @xmath0-asymptotics for this simplified relativistic model ,",
    "it is still desirable to examine models that not only represent qualitative features of relativistic systems but are also expected to be quantitatively correct . in particular , the pseudo - relativistic theory fails to reproduce the energies of hydrogen - like atoms .",
    "in fact , it predicts collapse of the innermost electron for ra ( @xmath9 ) and beyond , i.e. , it does not even allow to treat very large atoms . for this matter",
    "it is believed to be necessary to study hamiltonians that are derived directly from qed , among them the so called no - pair operators @xcite .",
    "the most simple of those models has been introduced by brown and ravenhall @xcite . in analogy to the schrdinger and chandrasekhar theory , cassanas and siedentop @xcite proved that to leading order this model has no effect on the energy asymptotics . in a further step frank , siedentop , and warzel",
    "@xcite established the scott correction for this model as well .",
    "however , although the brown - ravenhall model raises the energies of the chandrasekhar model , it nevertheless  even in the one - particle picture  predicts still too low energies . in consequence ,",
    "the scott correction which is determined by the pure unscreened coulomb potential is too small .",
    "in fact , the energy becomes unbounded from below at about @xmath10 , which is higher than any known element , but nevertheless lower than the expected value @xmath11 .",
    "in passing we would like to mention two recent results on the inclusion of the self - generated magnetic field ( quantized or not ) : it turns out that it does not affect the leading order ( erds and solovej @xcite ) .",
    "in fact the scott term is not affected in the chandrasekhar model either whereas in the non - relativistic setting  which is expected to be unphysical because of the argument mentioned above  the scott term would be changed @xcite .",
    "this and corresponding numerical results motivate us , to drop the self - generated magnetic fields in this paper .    despite the shortcomings of the original brown - ravenhall model",
    ", it is known that no - pair operators reproduce relativistic effects in a quantitative correct manner @xcite , when taking into account the external potential in determining the electron space ( furry picture ) @xcite .",
    "physically this is reasonable since the first order correction stemming from the innermost electrons is now derived from the dirac equation with the unscreened coulomb potential .",
    "this is actually the underlying physical argument for schwinger s @xcite relativistic correction .      the relativistic description of an electron moving in the potential of a static nucleus of charge @xmath0 and a mean - field potential @xmath12 is given by the dirac operator @xmath13 with @xmath14 in units of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this operator is self - adjointly realized in @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 are the three pauli matrices in standard representation . a physical example for @xmath12 would be the screening mean - field potential of the electrons .",
    "we will assume that @xmath12 is a bounded operator .",
    "assuming @xmath20 , nenciu @xcite showed that @xmath21 defined on @xmath22 has a distinguished self - adjoint extension whose domain includes @xmath23 and whose form domain is @xmath24 . by the usual abuse of notation we do no longer distinguish notationally between the original operator and its extension .",
    "moreover , we write @xmath25 for the pure coulomb - dirac operator without screening",
    ".    the energy form @xmath26 on @xmath27 is @xmath28:=&c^2\\left\\langle\\psi,\\left(\\sum_{\\nu=1}^{n}(d_{\\gamma}-1)_\\nu+ \\sum_{1\\leq\\mu<\\nu\\leq n } \\frac\\alpha{|\\bx_\\nu-\\bx_\\mu|}\\right)\\psi\\right\\rangle\\\\    = & \\left\\langle v_c\\psi,\\left(\\sum_{\\nu=1}^{n}(c\\balpha_\\nu\\cdot\\bp_\\nu+c^2\\beta_\\nu-\\frac{z}{|\\bx_\\nu|}-c^2)+ \\sum_{1\\leq\\mu<\\nu\\leq n } \\frac1{|\\bx_\\nu-\\bx_\\mu|}\\right)v_c\\psi\\right\\rangle    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 in our units , is the sommerfeld fine structure constant .",
    "the scaling map @xmath31 will be defined in section [ scaling ] .",
    "since electrons are fermions , we will restrict the domain to antisymmetric spinors @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , in the spirit of dirac s postulate of a filled dirac sea , brown and ravenhall @xcite and later sucher @xcite , extending this idea , formulated this mathematically by requiring that the one - electron space is given by the positive spectral subspace of a suitable dirac operator .",
    "typical choices for such operators :    free picture ( brown and ravenhall @xcite ) : :    the free dirac operator , i.e. , @xmath33 with    @xmath34 furry picture ( furry and oppenheimer @xcite ) : :    the dirac operator with the external potential , i.e. ,    @xmath35 with    @xmath36 intermediate or fuzzy picture ( mittleman @xcite ) : :    the intermediate picture with some screening potential    @xmath12 , e.g. it may be picked as the mean - field potential    of the dirac - hartree - fock equations . an optimal choice , which depends    on the two - particle density matrix , was suggested by mittleman . this    leads to a non - linear equation , which has been studied numerically    with great success in quantum chemistry , see , e.g. , saue @xcite .",

    "note the identity ( see , e.g. , greiner @xcite ) @xmath309 furthermore for fixed @xmath89 @xmath310 in @xmath311 the corresponding decomposition is obtained from the discussion above by noting that in @xmath312 eigenfunctions corresponding to the operators @xmath313 ( now acting on 4-spinors ) can be constructed as linear combinations of the 2-spinor eigenfunctions @xmath314 i.e. , @xmath315 where @xmath316 the orthogonal projections onto those spaces are denoted by @xmath317 and @xmath318 .",
    "while the dirac operator is not commuting with the orbital angular momentum @xmath160 , these subspaces of @xmath319 are still left invariant since @xmath320 ( balinsky and evans @xcite ) .",
    "the free dirac operator my defined using two unitary transforms , the fourier transform and the foldy - wouthuysen transform @xcite @xmath321 using @xmath322 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 , @xmath325 , through the following formula @xmath326 since the diagonal operator is self - adjoint with domain @xmath327 , @xmath33 , the free dirac operator is self - adjoint on @xmath328 .    for the brown - ravenhall operator this gives rise to the isometry @xmath329 where in fourier representation @xmath330 , @xmath331 .",
    "in particular , the isometric property is easy to see since the map @xmath332 for @xmath333 is an isometry from @xmath334 to @xmath335 independent of @xmath336 .",
    "in this section we will define the density matrix @xmath131 which will be used to bound the furry energy from above via the usual min - max principle",
    ". the construction will be in the spirit of @xcite , in particular the density matrix will be split into two parts , corresponding to low and high angular momenta respectively , i.e. , @xmath337 acting on @xmath17 and its non - relativistic version @xmath338 which is acting on @xmath67 .",
    "low angular momenta correspond to orbits with perihelions close to the nucleus , while high angular momenta prohibit orbits in the near vicinity of the nucleus",
    ". the separation will be set at @xmath339 $ ] .",
    "note that for the construction of the relativistic trial density matrix we lift the high angular momentum part of the non - relativistic density matrix from 2-spinor to 4-spinor space via the foldy wouthuysen transformation ( cf .",
    "appendix [ fwt ] ) . consequently @xmath131 neither belongs to the positive spectral subspaces of the hydrogenic nor the free dirac operator .",
    "however , by construction , the individual parts @xmath340 and @xmath341 do .",
    "close to the nucleus the electron - electron interaction will be dominated by the nuclear interaction .",
    "this is reflected by choosing the unmodified eigenfunctions of the coulomb - dirac operators for small angular momenta , @xmath342 where @xmath343 with @xmath344 $ ] and @xmath345 being eigenfunctions of the coulomb - dirac operator @xmath346 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath347 ( cf . ) and azimuthal quantum number @xmath81 .",
    "the cutoff @xmath348 was set on the order of the last occupied shell of the bohr atom .",
    "the dirac eigenfunctions can be computed explicitly and can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "likewise , we define the non - relativistic analogue @xmath349 with @xmath350 where @xmath351 denote the eigenfunctions of @xmath352 on @xmath353 with eigenvalues @xmath354 ( see ) .      for large angular momenta , the electrons are moving slowly at far distance from the nucleus .",
    "moreover , the correspondence principle demands a quasi - classical behavior for large quantum numbers .",
    "these heuristics suggest that for large angular momenta a semi - classical and non - relativistic description of the electrons in their mean field ( if assumed interacting ) and a description by the unscreened electrons for small angular momenta suffices to obtain not only the leading contribution to the ground state energy ( thomas - fermi ) but also its first correction ( scott ) , if the cut between the large and high angular momenta is chosen appropriately .",
    "this idea originates in @xcite and was guiding the construction of trial density matrices in @xcite .",
    "we will follow it also here .",
    "of course , the same heuristics additionally suggests that the difference between the furry and brown - ravenhall projections will be small for large angular momenta . that this is indeed the case is the essential technical contribution of this paper which allows to treat the furry picture .",
