    "the milky way ( mw ) is a member of a small group of galaxies called the local group ( lg ) . the lg is dominated by its two largest galaxies , the mw and the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) .",
    "the mass and dynamics of this group have been the topic of many previous studies ( e.g. , van den bergh 2000 ; van der marel & guhathakurta 2008 , hereafter vdmg08 ; li & white 2008 ; cox & loeb 2008 ; and references therein ) .",
    "analysis of these topics is important for interpretation of structures inside the lg , such as dark halos , satellite galaxies , and tidal streams .",
    "it is also important for understanding the lg in a proper cosmological context , since it provides the nearest example of both large scale structure and hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "while much progress has been made in understanding the lg mass and dynamics , this has not been based on actual knowledge of the three - dimensional velocity vector of m31 .",
    "this is because until now , the proper motion ( pm ) of m31 has been too small to measure with available techniques .    in paper  i ( sohn , anderson & van der marel 2012 ) we reported the very first absolute pms of m31 stars in three different fields observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) : a field along the minor axis sampling primarily the m31 spheroid ( the `` spheroid field '' ) , a field along the major axis sampling primarily the m31 outer disk ( the `` disk field '' ) , and a field along m31 s giant southern stream ( gss ) sampling primarily the stars that constitute this stream ( the `` stream field '' ) . for each field",
    "we measured the average pm of the m31 stars with respect to the stationary reference frame of background galaxies .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ t : intkin ] .",
    "pms in mas / yr were converted to velocities @xmath9 in km / s in the directions of west and north using the known distance @xmath10 of m31 . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath11 ( see references in vdmg08 ) .",
    "the velocity uncertainties are dominated by the pm uncertainties , with distance uncertainties making only a minimal contribution .",
    "in the present paper we use the observed pms to determine both the direction and size of the m31 velocity vector with respect to the mw , and we use this knowledge with the local group timing argument ( kahn & woltjer 1959 ; vdmg08 ; and li & white 2008 ) to estimate the lg mass .",
    "we then compare the velocity and mass results to independent estimates of the same quantities .",
    "for example , vdmg08 estimated the transverse motion of m31 based on the kinematics of satellite galaxies of m31 and the local group .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the local group has been estimated independently by adding up the individual masses of the mw and m31 , as estimated from various dynamical tracers ( e.g. klypin et al .",
    "2002 ; watkins et al .",
    "2010 ) . by statistically combining all the results we are able to build an improved and comprehensive understanding of the dynamics and mass of the lg .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we use @xmath0-body models of m31 and its prominent tidal substructures to calculate predictions for the _ internal _ kinematics of m31 stars in the three fields observed with hst .",
    "we use the results to correct the transverse velocities measured with hst , to estimate the transverse velocity of the m31 center - of - mass ( com ) . in section 3",
    "we revisit the methods of vdmg08 to estimate the m31 transverse motion from the kinematics of satellites , but with an expanded satellite sample .",
    "we combine the results with the hst measurements to obtain a final estimate for the m31 transverse motion . in section 4",
    "we derive the corresponding space motion in the galactocentric rest frame , taking into account the latest insights about the solar motion in the mw .",
    "the results are consistent with a radial orbit for m31 towards the mw . in section 5",
    "we use the m31 motion to estimate the lg mass using the timing argument . we find that the estimate is quite uncertain due to cosmic scatter , and we show how a more accurate estimate can be obtained by combining it with estimates of the individual mw and m31 masses . in section 6 we consider the galaxy m33 , the third most massive galaxy of the local group ( van den bergh 2000 ) , and we derive its relative velocity with respect to m31 .",
    "we also derive an estimate for the mass of m33 , and show that m33 is most likely bound to m31 , as is usually assumed .",
    "we use this knowledge to further refine our estimate for the local group mass . in section 7",
    "we discuss and summarize the main results of the paper .",
    "an appendix presents a discussion of various parameterizations used in the literature ( and the paper text ) to quantify the dark halo density profiles and masses of galaxies .",
    "where necessary to compare the properties of local group galaxies with predictions from cosmological simulations , we use a hubble constant @xmath12 and a matter density @xmath13 ( jarosik et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "this is the second paper in a series of three .",
    "paper iii ( van der marel et al .  2012 , in prep . ) will present a study of the future orbital evolution and merging of m31 , m33 , and the mw , using the velocities and masses derived in the present paper as starting conditions .",
    "the pms measured with hst in m31 fields contain contributions from both the m31 com motion , and from the internal kinematics of m31 . in each field",
    ", different fractions of the stars are contributed by different structural components .",
    "specifically , the galaxy has different equilibrium components , including both a disk and spheroids ( bulge / halo ) .",
    "we will refer to these jointly as the `` base galaxy '' .",
    "the galaxy also contains material that is in the process of being accreted .",
    "this includes in particular the material responsible for the creation of the gss ( which in fact is spread out over a large fraction of the projected area of the galaxy , and not just the actual position of the stream ) . to estimate the m31 com motion , we need to know for each field observed with hst both the fraction of the stars in each component , and the transverse motion kinematics of those stars .",
    "the fractional contributions can in principle be estimated purely observationally from line - of - sight ( los ) velocity studies .",
    "however , estimates of the transverse motion kinematics requires a full dynamical model , since these motions are not directly constrained observationally .",
    "we therefore resort to n - body models for m31 like those previously constructed by some of us ( e.g. , geehan et al .",
    "2006 ; fardal et al .  2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) to understand various observed features of m31 .",
    "the m31 model we use here is constructed from two separate but related parts .",
    "the base galaxy is an n - body realization of a model of the mass and light in m31 itself .",
    "the gss component is a snapshot from a dynamical n - body simulation of the formation of the gss , performed using the same mass model of m31 . taken together , these two components reproduce reasonably well the features in m31 that are expected to contribute to our hst fields .    the base galaxy , which is a slightly altered version of the model from geehan et al .  ( 2006 ) , contains bulge , disk , and halo components .",
    "the bulge and disk are assumed to be mostly baryonic and therefore trace the light . to the dark halo present in geehan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we add a stellar halo , which is necessary to reproduce the extended power - law component that has been discovered in the halo regions ( guhathakurta et al .  2005 ; irwin et al .  2005 ; kalirai et al .",
    "2006b ; chapman et al .  2006 ; ibata et al .",
    "we assume this stellar halo follows the mass distribution of the dark halo , although it contains only a tiny fraction of that mass .",
    "when added together , these components satisfy the surface - brightness profiles of m31 s bulge , disk , and halo regions reasonably well .",
    "most importantly for this study , they also satisfy a series of kinematic constraints , including the disk rotation curve , the bulge velocity dispersion , and constraints on the halo mass from statistical tracers such as globular clusters , planetary nebulae , satellite galaxies , and red giant stars .",
    "we created the particle realization of this model using the zeno library ( barnes 2011 ) .",
    "the gss component is created by simulating the disruption of a satellite galaxy , in a fixed potential corresponding to the mass model just discussed .",
    "the model is an updated version of that found in fardal et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , to which we refer the reader for a physical discussion .",
    "this model uses a spherical progenitor , although it is possible that the progenitor may in fact have been a disk galaxy ( fardal et al .",
    "2008 ) . after starting at large radius with carefully chosen initial conditions ,",
    "the satellite disrupts at its first pericentric passage .",
    "the model is evolved using the pkdgrav tree n - body code ( stadel 2001 ) for nearly 1  gyr , until it forms orbital wraps closely resembling features in m31 including the gss itself , and the ne and w shelves .",
    "we refer to all the particles generated by this component as the gss component , regardless of where they are on the sky .",
    "all the parameters of the base model , n - body simulations , and data - model comparisons are presented in fardal et al .",
    "( 2012 , in prep . ) .",
    "however , many properties and details are similar to preceding papers ( geehan et al .  2006 ; fardal et al .  2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) . besides the morphological evidence",
    ", the gss model satisfies a set of observational constraints , including the detailed kinematic pattern in the w shelf , the precise sky position of the gss , the distance to various fields along the gss ( mcconnachie et al .",
    "2003 ) , and their peak los velocities ( ibata et al .  2004",
    "; guhathakurta et al .",
    "2006 ; kalirai et al .",
    "2006a ; gilbert et al .",
    "we do not use the observed color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the hst pm fields to constrain the models , since those are not easily decomposed into distinct structural components .",
    "in fact , the cmds of the hst spheroid field and the hst stream field are strikingly similar , given that they are believed to be dominated by different structural components ( brown et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : nbodyproj ] shows a smoothed projected view of the n - body model .",
    "the gss is visible south - east of the galaxy center , and the north - east and western shelf are emphasized with dashed outlines .",
    "this image can be compared to star - count maps of giant stars in m31 , which show the same features ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "2005 ; gilbert et al .  2009 ; or paper",
    "i , which also shows the location of our pm fields ) .",
    "figure  [ f : nbodyvel ] shows a smoothed view of the n - body model in los velocity vs.  projected distance space , for particles south - east of the galaxy center .",
    "there is good agreement between the outline of the gss in this representation ( dark band in the figure ) , and the observed peak los velocity of the gss as a function of radius ( blue points ) , including that measured in the hst stream pm field of paper  i ( circle ) .",
    "the predictions of the n - body model for m31 are summarized in table  [ t : intkin ] for each of the three hst fields .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is the fraction of the stars that belongs to the base galaxy , and @xmath15 is the fraction of the stars that belongs to the gss .",
    "the average velocities in the los , w , and n directions are listed for both the base and the gss components , and also for their properly weighted average ( `` all '' ) .",
    "the quantities were extracted over fields that are somewhat larger than the hst fields ( up to 10 arcmin from the field center ) , to decrease the n - body shot noise .",
    "all velocities are expressed in a reference frame in which m31 is at rest .",
    "the average internal transverse velocity kinematics of the m31 stars in the hst fields @xmath16 are generally small , always below 125 km / s in absolute value .",
    "there are several reasons for this . in the hst spheroid field",
    "we are sampling primarily the spheroidal components of m31 . at large radii",
    "these have limited mean rotation ( dorman et al .",
    "2012 ) . in the hst disk field",
    "we are primarily sampling the m31 disk , which has a sizeable circular velocity ( @xmath17 km / s ) .",
    "however , m31 has a large inclination .",
    "so along the major axis , most of the rotation is seen along the los , and not in the transverse direction . in the hst stream field",
    "we are primarily sampling the gss , which has a significant mean three - dimensional velocity ( @xmath18 km / s ) .",
    "however , the inclination of the stream is such that most of the velocity is seen along the los .",
    "moreover , some 20% of the stars in the stream field do not belong to the gss , but mostly to the spheroid component .    for all three fields ,",
    "the contribution to the observed transverse motion from the internal kinematics of m31 is similar to or smaller than the random errors in the hst measurements .",
    "even significant fractional changes in the model predictions therefore do not strongly affect our final results .",
    "it therefore did not seem worthwhile in the context of the present study to further refine the model .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth pointing out that the model is far from perfect , and that there are some salient features of m31 that it fails to reproduce .",
    "for example , the model with a spherical progenitor overestimates the contribution of gss particles on their first orbital wrap to fields along the minor axis ( especially those more distant than our spheroid field ) .",
    "also , los velocity studies of the gss have revealed a secondary cold component ( in addition to the gss and base galaxy ; e.g. , kalirai et al .",
    "2006a ; gilbert et al .  2007 , 2009 ) which is not reproduced by our model .",
    "this could be , e.g. , from a severely warped disk component , or from wrapped - around material of a gss loop not included in our model . and finally , some authors have proposed models for the structure of m31 s outer and accreted components that differ from those in our models ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "2005 ; gilbert et al .",
    "2007 ) .    to estimate the transverse m31 com motion from the data for each hst field , we first subtract the contribution from internal m31 kinematics ( @xmath19 ) from the measurement ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we then correct for the effect of viewing perspective as described in van der marel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and vdm08 .",
    "this corrects for the fact that at the position of each field , the m31 com systemic los and transverse velocity , respectively , are not exactly aligned along the _ local _ los and transverse directions .",
    "the corrections are small ( below 10 km / s in absolute value ) , because all fields are located within 2 degrees of the m31 center .",
    "the final estimates are listed in table  [ t : intkin ] as @xmath21 , and are summarized also at the top of table  [ t : andvel ] . in propagating the uncertainties , we assigned an uncertainty of 20 km / s per coordinate to the model of the m31 internal kinematics .",
    "this number need not be known accurately , since the final uncertainties are always dominated by measurement errors in the pms .",
    "the results for the three different fields are mutually consistent with each other at the 1@xmath4 level ( see also paper  i quantity , @xmath22 , that assesses the extent to which measurements for different fields agree . table  [ t : andvel ] implies @xmath23 , for @xmath24 degrees of freedom . ] ) .",
    "this justifies the use of a straightforward weighted average to combine the results , which gives @xmath25 km / s . for comparison ,",
    "the direct weighted average of the hst observations , with no corrections for internal m31 kinematics , is @xmath26 km / s .",
    "clearly , the corrections for internal kinematics make only a small difference for the final transverse velocity estimate .",
    "the fact that the differences are below 10 km / s is due to our combination of results for well - chosen fields , since the per - field corrections are much larger than this .",
    "in vdmg08 we presented several methods for estimating the space motion of m31 from the kinematics of satellites , which assume that the satellites of m31 and the lg on average follow their motion through space .",
    "the m31 transverse velocity derived in that paper has random error bars of 34 to 41 km / s .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than what we have obtained here from the hst pm measurements , although the systematic error bars on the vdmg08 values may be larger ( because the underlying methodology makes more assumptions ) .",
    "either way , these results remain of considerable interest as an independent constraint on the m31 space motion .",
    "we therefore update here the results from vdmg08 using additional satellite data that has become available more recently .",
    "the first method of vdm08 is based on the fact that any transverse motion of m31 induces an apparent solid body rotation in the line - of - sight velocity field of its satellites , superposed on their otherwise primarily random motions .",
    "the amplitude and major axis of the rotation field are determined by the size and direction of m31 s transverse motion . in vdm08",
    "we constrained the m31 transverse motion by fitting the velocities of 17 m31 satellites with known line - of - sight velocities .",
    "for the present study we added the satellites listed in table  [ t : satlos ] .",
    "these are objects that previously either did not have los velocity measurements available , or which had not yet been discovered .",
    "this includes six dsph galaxies : and xi , xiii , xv , xvi , xxi , and xxii .",
    "three other recently discovered dsph galaxies , and xvii , xix , xx , have not yet had their los velocities measured . as in vdmg08 , we leave out and xii and xiv , because their large negative los velocities with respect to m31 indicate that they may be falling into m31 for the first time ( chapman et al .  2007 ; majewski et al .",
    "we also leave out the more recently discovered and xviii , which may be too distant from m31 to be directly associated with it ( mcconnachie et al .",
    "we do include and xxii , even though it may be a satellite of m33 rather than m31 ( martin et al .",
    "2009 ; tollerud et al .",
    "we note that and iv is not included in our combined sample because it is a background galaxy ( ferguson et al .",
    "2000 ) , while and viii is not a galaxy at all ( merrett et al .",
    "2006 ) . for all dsphs , including those from paper  i and not listed in table  [ t : satlos ]",
    ", we used the newly measured los velocities from tollerud et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , where available . otherwise , the values listed in paper  i or the sources listed in table  [ t : satlos ] were used .",
    "our new sample in table  [ t : satlos ] also includes the 8 globular clusters of m31 that lie at projected distances @xmath27 kpc and have known los velocities .",
    "we repeated the vdmg08 analysis , using the combined sample of the 17 satellites in table  1 of vdmg08 and the 14 satellites in table  [ t : satlos ] .",
    "the implied space motion of m31 is listed in table  [ t : andvel ] in the row labeled `` m31 satellites '' . the result for @xmath28 differs from that derived in vdmg08 by",
    "@xmath29 km / s .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the error bars in the result of @xmath30 km / s .",
    "the addition of the 14 new satellites has not decreased the error bars on the result .",
    "this is in part because most satellites are observed relatively close to m31 , so that any solid - body rotation signal would be small .",
    "as before , the new result is roughly consistent at the 1@xmath4 level with zero transverse motion .",
    "so no solid - body rotation component is confidently detected , which in turn implies that m31 can not have a very large transverse motion .",
    "the fits imply a one - dimensional velocity dispersion for the satellite sample of @xmath31 km / s .",
    "this is @xmath32 larger than the value derived in vdmg08 , which again is within the uncertainties .",
    "the second method of vdm08 is based on the m31 satellites m33 and ic 10 .",
    "these galaxies have accurately known pms from water - maser observations ( brunthaler et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "the three - dimensional velocity vectors of these galaxies give an estimate of the m31 space motion to within an accuracy of @xmath33 per coordinate .",
    "transplanting the m33 and ic 10 velocity vectors to the position of m31 , followed by projection onto the local los , w , and n directions , yields the results listed in table  [ t : andvel ] in the rows labeled `` m33 pm '' and `` ic 10 pm '' .",
    "these are identical to what was derived in vdmg08 , but with slightly larger uncertainties ( due to the increased estimate of @xmath33 ) .",
    "the third method of vdmg08 is based on the line - of - sight velocities of local group satellites that are not individually bound to the mw or m31 . in vdmg08",
    "the method was applied to 5 satellites ( see their table 2 ) .",
    "the cetus dsph ( ra@xmath34 , dec@xmath35 ) was excluded because of lack of knowledge of its los velocity at the time . for the present study we have rerun the analysis including cetus , using @xmath36 km / s from lewis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . its distance @xmath37 ( mcconnachie et al .",
    "2005 ) places cetus at @xmath38 from the local group barycenter .",
    "with addition of the cetus dsph to the vdmg08 analysis , the implied space motion of m31 is listed in table  [ t : andvel ] in the row labeled `` outer lg galaxies '' .",
    "the result for @xmath28 differs from that derived in vdmg08 by @xmath39 km / s .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the error bars in the result of @xmath40 km / s .",
    "in general , modeling of satellite galaxy dynamics can be complicated for a variety of reasons , especially when the goal is to estimate galaxy masses : the satellite system may not be virialized , with continueing orbital evolution ( mateo et al .",
    "2008 ) or infall ( e.g. , chapman et al .  2007 ; majewski et al .",
    "2007 ) ; the distribution of satellite orbits may not be isotropic ( e.g. , watkins et al .",
    "2010 ) ; satellites on large - period orbits are not expected to be randomly distributed in orbital phase ( e.g. , zaritsky & white 1994 ) ; satellites may have correlated kinematics ( e.g. , van den bergh 1998 ) ; and the three - dimensional distribution of satellites may not be spherical ( koch & grebel 2006 ) or symmetric ( mcconnachie & irwin 2006 )",
    ". however , many of these potential issues do not affect the analysis that we have presented here and in vdmg08 to estimate the m31 transverse velocity .",
    "sections  [ ss : los ] and  [ ss : pm ] only assume that the m31 satellites are drawn from a distribution that has the same mean velocity as m31 , and which has no mean rotation .",
    "section  [ ss : outerlos ] only assumes that the lg satellites are drawn from a distribution that has the same mean velocity as the lg barycenter .",
    "virialized equilibrium , isotropy , random phases , or symmetry are not required .",
    "nonetheless , there is always the possibility that residual systematics may have affected the results . to get a handle on this ,",
    "we have compared in detail the results for the m31 transverse velocity from the different techniques .",
    "the @xmath28 for m31 inferred from the different methods in sections  [ ss : los][ss : outerlos ] are in mutual agreement to within the uncertainties .",
    "the same was true also in the original analysis of vdmg08 . since the methods and the underlying data are quite different for the various estimates , this in itself is a direct indication that any residual systematics can not be large .",
    "since the results from the different methods are in agreement , it is reasonable to take their weighted average , as listed in table  [ t : andvel ] .",
    "the result for @xmath28 differs from that derived in vdmg08 by @xmath41 km / s .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the error bars in the result of @xmath42 km / s , so the new analysis presented here has not significantly altered the results previously derived by vdmg08 .",
    "an even stronger check on any residual systematics is provided by figure  [ f : vwvn ] .",
    "it compares the weighted average of the hst pm measurements ( with corrections for internal kinematics ) from section  [ s : intkin ] ( as listed in table  [ t : andvel ] ) with the weighted average from the updated vdmg08 analysis .",
    "the difference between these results is @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the results are consistent within the uncertainties : the probability of a residual this large occurring by chance in a _ two - dimensional _ gaussian distribution is 26% . since the methods employed are totally different , and have quite different scopes for possible systematic errors , this is very successful agreement .",
    "this suggests not only that there are no large residual systematics in the results from the satellite kinematics , but also that there are no large residual systematics in the m31 pm analysis .",
    "this is a very important cross - check , since the displacements on which our pm measurements are based are below @xmath44 detector pixels ( see paper  i for a detailed discussion of the systematic error control in the pm analysis ) .    since the hst pm analysis and the satellite kinematics analysis yield statistically consistent results for the m31 transverse velocity , it is reasonable to take the weighted average of the results from the two methodologies .",
    "this yields @xmath45 as listed in the bottom row of table  [ t : andvel ] and shown in black in figure  [ f : vwvn ] .",
    "this is the final result that we use for the remainder of our analysis .",
    "as in vdmg08 , we adopt a cartesian coordinate system @xmath46 , with the origin at the galactic center , the @xmath47-axis pointing towards the galactic north pole , the @xmath48-axis pointing in the direction from the sun to the galactic center , and the @xmath49-axis pointing in the direction of the sun s galactic rotation .",
    "we choose the origin of the frame to be at rest ( the galactocentric rest frame ) , and we wish to calculate the velocity of galaxies in this frame .",
    "this requires knowledge of the solar velocity in the milky way , since the solar reflex motion contributes to any _ observed _ velocities ( such as the _ heliocentric _ velocities listed in table  [ t : andvel ] ) .",
    "in vdmg08 we adopted the standard iau values ( kerr & lynden - bell 1986 ) for the distance of the sun from the galactic center @xmath50 , and the circular velocity of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , @xmath51 km / s .",
    "neither of these quantities has historically been known particularly accurately though , and their exact values continue to be debated . recently ,",
    "a number of new methodologies have become available .",
    "these provide new insights into @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and we therefore use the results from these studies here .    some of the best constraints on @xmath52 now come from studies of the orbits of stars around the sgr a * supermassive black hole .",
    "gillessen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) obtained @xmath54 ( consistent also with ghez et al .",
    "most of the available constraints on the velocity @xmath53 are actually constraints on the ratio @xmath55 .",
    "the best constraint on this ratio now comes from the observed pm of sgr a * , since the black hole is believed to be at rest in the galaxy to within @xmath56 km / s .",
    "reid & brunthaler ( 2004 ) obtained that @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 is the peculiar velocity of the sun in the rotation direction . in vdmg08",
    "we adopted the solar peculiar velocity from dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , there is now increasing evidence that @xmath58 from that study ( and other studies ) is too small by @xmath59 km / s .",
    "we adopt here the more recent estimates from schnrich , binney , & dehnen ( 2010 ) : @xmath60 , with uncertainties of @xmath61 ( being the quadrature sum of the random and systematic errors ) . combination of these results implies that @xmath62 km / s , significantly larger than the canonical iau value of 220 km / s . the uncertainty is dominated entirely by the uncertainty in @xmath52 , and the errors in @xmath53 and @xmath52",
    "are highly correlated .",
    "observations of masers in high - mass star - formation regions in the mw have been used to argue independently for a value of @xmath53 in excess of the canonical @xmath63 ( reid et al .",
    "however , mcmillan & binney ( 2010 ) showed that these data by themselves do not strongly constrain the galactic parameters . on the other hand ,",

    "2002 ; besla et al .",
    "2007 ) , and cosmological simulation results ( neto et al .  2007 ; klypin et al .",
    "this implies @xmath95 ( eq .  [ [ m200 ] ] ) .      under the assumption of keplerian motion , the relative orbit of m31 and the mw",

    "there are as many observables as unknowns , so the orbital parameters and @xmath105 can be determined uniquely .",
    "the implied value of @xmath106 is called the `` timing mass '' .",
    "most commonly , the relevant equations are solved under the assumption of a radial orbit ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) , but this assumption is not necessary when a measurement of @xmath102 is actually available ( e.g. , vdmg08 ) .    for the m31 space motion derived above , the `` timing mass '' @xmath109 . when a radial orbit is assumed ( which is consistent with the data )",

    "some of the decrease in timing mass is due to the fact that @xmath102 found here is slightly smaller than in vdmg08 .",

    "this slower approach implies a lower timing mass .",
    "the timing argument equations are based on a simple keplerian formalism . to assess how accurate this argument is in a cosmological context one must make comparisons to @xmath0-body simulations ( kroeker & carlberg 1991 ) .",

    "however , not surprisingly , their figure  6 shows that the scatter increase with @xmath70 . since we now know that m31 actually has a low value of @xmath70 , it is more appropriate to quantify the cosmic scatter by restricting the statistics to pairs in the simulation with low @xmath70 .",
    "we measured by hand from their figure  6 all pairs with @xmath118 km / s , and extracted the ratio @xmath119 .",

    "a radial infall model is generally assumed , which is almost certainly an oversimplification ( see vdmg08 ) . ]",

    "watkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied the kinematics of m31 satellites and found that the mass within @xmath123 is determined fairly robustly , @xmath124 .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is the quadrature sum of the random error of @xmath125 , and a systematic uncertainty of @xmath126 due to the assumed velocity anisotropy of the satellites .",
    "there may be other systematic uncertainties in the analysis , but these are more difficult to quantify and are neglected here . at this mass and with the relevant halo concentrations , @xmath127 ( see appendix  [ s : darkprof ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath128 . we use this to set a gaussian probability distribution for @xmath129 in our discussion below ( blue curve in top panel of figure  [ f : masses ] ) .",

    "watkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that mass estimates for the mass of the mw from satellite kinematics are much more uncertain .",
    "this is due to the unknown velocity anisotropy , combined with the fact that we see most satellites almost radially from near the galactic center .",
    "good mass estimates therefore need to fold in a more diverse set of observational constraints .",
    "moreover , uncertainties are reduced significantly by assuming that the radial profile of the dark matter is known , and follows a cosmologically motivated parameterization .",

    "this distribution has the same mean ( @xmath145 ) as inferred by mcmillan ( 2011 ) , and the same dispersion ( @xmath146 ) as we use for m31 , but with a broader , flatter shape .",
    "we use the listed probability distributions for the individual m31 and mw masses as priors ; this also sets a prior probability distribution for @xmath147 ( magenta curve in top panel of figure  [ f : masses ] ) .",

    "we draw a random mass from the probability distribution for @xmath148 derived from the timing argument ( red curve in top panel of figure  [ f : masses ] ) .",
    "we then draw a random @xmath142 from its prior distribution .",
    "we then calculate the corresponding @xmath149 , and its probability @xmath150 given the prior distribution for @xmath151 .",
    "this set of values is then accepted or rejected in monte - carlo sense , depending on the probability @xmath150 .",
    "we thus build up posterior probability distributions for @xmath142 , @xmath152 , and @xmath148 , which are shown as dotted lines with the same colors in the bottom panel of figure  [ f : masses ] .",

    "the likelihood of mw and m31 masses at the low end of the prior distributions is significantly reduced in the posterior distributions .",

    "the prior distribution for @xmath148 corresponds to @xmath158 , while its posterior distribution corresponds to @xmath159 .",
    "therefore , inclusion of the timing argument increases the estimate of the lg mass by only @xmath160% , due to the large cosmic variance .",
    "since this is considerably smaller than the prior uncertainties on @xmath142 and @xmath151 , the timing argument does not in fact help much to constrain the total lg mass , beyond what we already know from the mw and m31 individually .",
    "we have found this to be a robust conclusion , independent of the exact probability distributions adopted for m31 and the mw , and independent of the exact solar and m31 motion adopted in the timing argument .",

    "therefore , our observational knowledge of the masses , velocities , and distances of these two galaxies indicates that indeed , they most likely form a bound pair .",
    "the observation of tidal features associated with m33 independently implies that m31 and m33 are likely a bound pair ( braun & thilker 2004 ; mcconnachie et al .  2009 ) .",
    "if we enforce this as a prior assumption , then this affects our posterior estimates of the m31 and m33 masses . to enforce this assumption",
    ", we merely need to remove from our monte - carlo scheme those initial conditions in which m33 and m31 are not bound .",
    "figure  [ f : masses]b shows as solid histograms the posterior distributions after application of this additional prior .",
    "the main effect is to disallow some of the initial conditions in which @xmath222 ( blue curve ) is on the low end of its probability distribution .",
    "the average and rms mass increase from @xmath223 to @xmath224 .",
    "the mass distribution of m33 is not appreciably affected .",
    "the posterior mass distribution for @xmath225 is shown as the cyan histogram .",
    "its average and rms are @xmath226 this is similar to the result from section  [ ss : posterior ] , which was @xmath227 .",
    "hence , the assumption that m33 must be bound to m31 does not help much to reduce the uncertainties in the lg mass , since the fact that they are bound is already implied at high confidence by the observed velocities .",
    "the probability distributions of m31 and m33 distances and velocities are not appreciably affected by the additional prior that m31 and m33 be bound .",
    "the average positions and velocities in the galactocentric rest frame remain the same to within @xmath228 and a few km / s , respectively , after the unbound orbits are removed .",
    "we have presented the most accurate estimate to date of the transverse motion of m31 with respect to the sun .",
    "this estimate was made possible by the first pm measurements for m31 , made using hst , and presented in paper  i. we have combined these measurements with other insights to constrain the transverse motion of m31 with respect to the mw .",
    "we have used the resulting motion to improve our understanding of the mass of the local group , and its dominant galaxies m31 and the mw .",
    "the hst pm measurements from paper  i pertain to three fields in m31 .",
    "the pm for each field contains contributions from three components : the m31 com motion , the known viewing perspective , and the internal kinematics of m31 . to correct for the contributions from internal kinematics ,",
    "we have constructed detailed @xmath0-body models .",
    "the models include both the equilibrium disk , bulge , spheroid , and dark - halo components , as well as the material from a tidally disrupted satellite galaxy that is responsible for the gss .",
    "even though the stars in m31 move at velocities of hundreds of km / s , the internal - kinematics corrections to the observed pms averaged over all fields is quite small ( @xmath229 , well below the random uncertainties in the measurements ) .",
    "this is largely due to the known properties of the carefully chosen field locations , and the galaxy components that they sample .",
    "the resulting m31 transverse motion should be largely free from systematic errors , based on the many internal consistency checks built into our pm program , as discussed in paper i. this includes the fact that the observations for the three different fields , including observations with different instruments at different times , all yield statistically consistent estimates for the m31 com motion .",
    "nonetheless , an entirely independent check on the results is obtained by comparison to the m31 transverse motion estimates implied by the methods from vdmg08 , which are based exclusively on the kinematics of the _ satellite galaxies _ of m31 and local group .",
    "instead of using the published results from vdmg08 directly , we have redone their analysis using expanded satellite samples , including new data that has become available in recent years .",
    "the end result is similar to what was already published by vdmg08 .",
    "more importantly , the result is statistically consistent with that obtained from the hst pm program . since the methods employed are totally different , and have very different scopes for possible systematic errors , this is very successful agreement .",
    "this gives added confidence in both results , and also suggests that a further reduction in the uncertainties can be obtained by taking the weighted average of both methods .",
    "this yields @xmath230 , which is our final estimate for the _ heliocentric _ transverse motion of m31 .",
    "the uncertainties in this result are similar to what has been obtained from vlba observations of water masers in the m31 satellites m33 and ic10 ( brunthaler et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ) .    to understand the motion of m31 with respect to the mw , it is necessary to correct for the reflex motion of the sun .",
    "we adopted the most recent insights into the solar motion within the milky way .",
    "these imply an azimuthal motion for the sun ( the sum of the lsr motion and the solar peculiar velocity ) of @xmath17 km / s , which is @xmath231 km / s higher than what has typically been used in previous studies .",
    "this implies a radial approach velocity of m31 with respect to the milky way of @xmath232 , which is @xmath180 km / s slower than what has typically been used in previous studies .",
    "the best estimate for the tangential velocity component is @xmath3 , with 1@xmath4 confidence region @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the velocity of m31 is statistically consistent with a radial ( head - on collision ) orbit towards the mw at the 1@xmath4 level .    the new insights into the motion of m31 with respect to the mw allowed us to revise estimates of the local group timing mass , as presented most recently by vdmg08 and li & white ( 2008 ) .",
    "this yields @xmath233 for an assumed radial orbit , with a random error from observational uncertainties of @xmath234 .",
    "this result is @xmath180% lower than typically found in previous studies , due to the lower @xmath101 used here .",
    "we calibrated the timing mass as in li & white ( 2008 ) based on cosmological simulations .",
    "however , we selected from their galaxy pairs in the millennium simulation only those with low @xmath102 , for consistency with the observations .",
    "this yields @xmath235 , where the uncertainty now includes cosmic scatter ( which dominates over random errors ) .",
    "we have presented a bayesian statistical analysis to combine the timing mass estimate for @xmath122 with estimates for the individual masses of m31 and the mw obtained from other dynamical methods . for the individual masses we used relatively broad priors that encompass most values suggested in the literature .",
    "even then , the cosmic scatter in the timing mass is too large to help much in constraining the mass of the local group .",
    "its main impact is to increase by @xmath7% the mass estimates already known for the individual galaxies ( and their sum ) .    in an attempt to further refine the m31 and local group mass estimates ,",
    "we have studied the galaxy m33 .",
    "its known pm allowed us to study the relative motion between m31 and m33 .",
    "a range of arguments suggests that the mass of m33 is @xmath7% of the m31 mass .",
    "the masses and relative motions of m31 and m33 indicate that they are a bound pair at @xmath236% confidence .",
    "observational evidence for tidal deformation between m33 and m31 suggests that the small 5% probability for unbound pairs , as allowed by the observational uncertainties , may not be physical .",
    "this makes low values for the m31 mass unlikely , and hence increases the expectation value for the local group mass , but only by @xmath56% .",
    "our final estimate for the local group mass from all considerations is @xmath237 .",
    "the velocity vectors between m31 , m33 and the mw are all closely aligned with the plane that contains these galaxies .",
    "paper iii presents a study of the future orbital evolution and merging of these galaxies , using the velocities and masses derived here as starting conditions .",
