    "alfven waves are ubiquitous in space and solar plasmas and also , super - thermal particles play an important role in the same situations . some of the examples include : earths auroral zone where observations show two modes of particle acceleration : auroral electrons narrowly peaked at specific energy , implying existence of a static parallel electric field ( e.g. @xcite ) ; and observations by fast spacecraft ( e.g. @xcite ) which show electrons with broad energy and narrow in pitch angle distribution .",
    "the latter suggests that the inertial alfven wave ( iaw ) time - varying parallel electric field accelerates electrons .",
    "also , in solar corona , about half of the energy released during solar flares is converted into the energy of accelerated particles @xcite .",
    "the time - varying parallel electric field maybe produced by low frequency ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ion cyclotron frequency ) dispersive alfven waves ( daw ) whose wavelength , perpendicular to the background magnetic field , becomes comparable to any of the kinetic spatial scales such as : ion gyro - radius at electron temperature , @xmath4 , ion thermal gyro - radius , @xmath5 , @xcite or to electron inertial length @xmath6 @xcite . under space plasma nomenclature daws",
    "are sub - divided into inertial alfven waves or kinetic alfven waves ( kaw ) depending on the relation between the plasma @xmath7 and electron / ion mass ratio @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath9 ( i.e. when alfven speed is much greater than electron and ion thermal speeds , @xmath10 ) dominant mechanism for sustaining @xmath11 is the parallel electron inertia and such waves are called inertial alfven waves . in the opposite case of @xmath12 ,",
    "( i.e. when @xmath13 ) the thermal effects are more important and the main mechanism for supporting @xmath11 is the parallel electron pressure gradient .",
    "such waves are called kinetic alfven waves .",
    "@xcite gives an overview of the previous work on this topic in some detail .",
    "@xcite studies the interaction of an isolated alfven wave packet with a plasma density cavity .",
    "@xcite considered particle acceleration by daws in the transversely inhomogeneous plasma via full kinetic simulation particularly focusing on the effect of polarization of the waves and different regimes ( inertial and kinetic ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite studied particle acceleration by the low frequency ( @xmath14 ) daws , similar to considered in , in _",
    "2.5d geometry_. subsequently , @xcite considered 3d effects on particle acceleration and parallel electric field generation .",
    "in particular , instead of 1d transverse , to the magnetic field , density ( and temperature ) inhomogeneity , the 2d transverse density ( and temperature ) inhomogeneity was considered .",
    "this was in a form of a circular cross - section cylinder , in which density ( and temperature ) varies smoothly across the uniform magnetic field that fills entire simulation domain .",
    "such structure mimics a solar coronal loop which is kept in total pressure balance .    as described in @xcite , presence and damping of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves",
    "is of importance to several problems : ( i ) the solar coronal heating problem @xcite , ( ii ) earth magnetosphere energization in the context of electron acceleration by alfven harmonic waves and pulses propagating in an auroral plasma cavities @xcite .",
    "( iii ) fast acceleration of inner magnetospheric hydrogen and oxygen ions by shock induced ulf waves @xcite .",
    "( iv ) heating and stability of tokamak plasmas , e.g. dynamics of shear alfven waves collectively excited by energetic particles in tokamak plasmas @xcite .",
    "( v ) heating with waves in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies is a well - established method on present - day tokamaks and one of the heating systems foreseen for iter @xcite . ( vi )",
    "it was also suggested @xcite that off - axis ion bernstein wave heating modifies the electron pressure profile and the current density profile can be redistributed , suppressing the magnetohydrodynamic tearing mode instability .",
    "such approach provides both the stabilization of tearing modes and control of the pressure profiles .",
    "phase mixing of harmonic alfven waves ( aw ) , which propagate in plasma having a density inhomogeneity in transverse to the uniform background magnetic field direction , results in their fast damping in the density gradient regions . in the harmonic case",
    "the dissipation time scales as @xmath15 .",
    "where @xmath16 is the lundquist number , @xmath17 is plasma resistivity , while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are characteristic length- and velocity- scales of the system .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that aw amplitude damps in time as @xmath20 , where symbols have their usual meaning and @xmath21 denotes alfven speed derivative in the density inhomogeneity direction .",
    "phase mixing of alfven waves which have gaussian profile along the background magnetic field results in slower , power - law damping , @xmath22 , as established by @xcite , and is also derived in more mathematically elegant way in .",
    "resuming aforesaid , the motivation for this study is as following : in the previous works harmonic , phase - mixed , alfven wave dynamics was considered both in the kinetic and magnetohydrodynamic regime .",
    "up today only magnetohydrodynamic , phase - mixed , gaussian alfven pulses were investigated . in the present work this is",
    "extend into kinetic , dispersive , alfven pulse regime .",
    "thus , phase - mixed , gaussian alfven pulses are studied , which are more appropriate for solar flares , than the harmonic waves , as the flares are impulsive in their nature .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that considered the effect of the hall term in the generalised ohm s law on the damping and phase mixing of gaussian alfven pulses in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies in uniform and non - uniform equilibrium plasmas .",
    "our work extends the latter results by considering fully kinetic picture , beyond just the hall term .",
    "@xcite explored the possibility that electrons could be accelerated by inertial alfven gaussian pulses to hard x - ray - emitting energies in the low solar corona during flares .",
    "our work extends the latter reference by including the effect of transverse inhomogeneity in the alfven speed , i.e. the effect of phase - mixing .",

    "there are possibilities of excitation of kaws or iaws by means of turbulent cascade @xcite or magnetic field - aligned currents i.e. essentially electron beams drifting with respect to stationary ions @xcite or fast ion beam excitation @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the situation when kaws are excited by current ( fluid ) instability .",
    "the instability condition for this excitation by current is satisfied when the drift velocity , @xmath23 , and kaws can efficiently grow .",
    "however , @xcite did not include the resonant excitation of daws by the inverse landau damping because its instability condition requires a larger drift velocity , in general , larger than the alfven velocity .",

    "possibility of existence of such thin loop threads , tens of cm wide , in the solar corona is debatable , based on loops observed with trace and sdo s aia .",

    "it is quite natural that the dispersive term @xmath120 appears in the equation describing dispersive ( inertial ) alfven wave .",

    "we employ non - unitary fourier forward and inverse transforms @xmath126 substituting equation  [ eq15 ] into [ eq13 ] with the initial ( at @xmath127 instant ) condition , @xmath128 , we obtain @xmath129 we used here the fact that fourier transform of simple gaussian @xmath130 is also a gaussian in k - space @xmath131 . for large times @xmath132 , as done in equation ( a.5 ) from , from the triple sum under the exponent in equation  [ eq16 ] we keep the largest term @xmath133 . noting that @xmath134 and using equation  [ eq16 ] , we obtain asymptotic ( the large times ) solution for @xmath92 as following @xmath135 here @xmath136 is the gamma - function .",

    "[ fig3 ] the usual phase mixing picture , i.e. @xmath75 and @xmath74 pulses are excited that propagate in positive and negative x - direction , because the electric field driving according to equation  [ eq3 ] is unable to excite a clear eigen - mode of the system propagating on in the positive x - direction . as throughout the paper",

    "the pulse that propagates to the right ( positive x - direction ) is also clearly present .",
    "because according to equation  [ eq1 ] the density is smoothly enhanced by a factor of 4 in the middle of y - coordinate range , phase speed of the wave is slower there , as roughly @xmath139 .",

    "we quantify the particle acceleration by introducing the following quantities : @xmath160 @xmath161 where @xmath162 are electron or ion velocity distribution functions and @xmath163 brackets denote average over y - coordinate , because temperature and density vary across y - coordinate .",

    "[ fig5 ] , but for the run1h .",
    "it is barely visible that the two bumps in the parallel to the field distribution function , @xmath193 , have now shifted from 0.25 to 0.125 .",
    "thus we replaced panel ( b ) with @xmath194 blue and @xmath195 red curve , in oder to stress the difference between the distribution functions at different times .",
    "it is evident the the bumps are now near @xmath196 .",
    "this proves that the acceleration of the particles is due to landau damping .",
    "similar conclusion also was reached before , when the harmonic daw was considered in , in 2.5d geometry and 3d geometry in @xcite .",
    "other noteworthy feature is the for run1h we see more efficient particle acceleration , as @xmath157 index starts from @xmath164 and stops at @xmath197 , meaning that @xmath198 , i.e. four percent of electrons are accelerated above thermal speeds .",
    "thus four times more massive ions result in four times more efficient electron acceleration .",
    "of course , this is still far below of requirement to produce x - rays in solar flares , where @xmath199 percent of electrons are accelerated .",
    "it is unclear what the results would be for the realistic mass ratio of @xmath200 .",
    "[ fig9 ] presents the numerical simulation results for the electromagnetic fields for run 2 . in run 2",
    "we also output 20 , equally spaced in time data snapshots and each column in the figure corresponds to 1st , 10th , 20th snapshot . @xmath75 and @xmath74",
    "show again phase - mixed behaviour , but the new type of initial conditions according to equation  [ eq4 ] now only result in a single @xmath74 positive pulse being split into two positive pulses with half amplitude travelling in opposite directions . in the case of run 1 ,",
    "the pulse the moved to the right was positive while one moving to the left was negative . parallel electric field is also generated in the transverse density gradient regions and now seen about around @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "but for the run 2 .",
    "here the numerical fit produces the following scaling law @xmath201.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows the pulse amplitude dynamics as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] but for the run 2 . in this case",
    "the numerical fit produces the scaling law of @xmath201 .",
    "this exponent is note quite @xmath202 but reasonably close .",
    "the discrepancy could be due to the fact the the excited pulse is not quite an eigen - mode of the system and also the non - linearity could play role as the pulse amplitude is @xmath203 , while the @xmath204 is according to the linear kdv equation .",
    "there are many similarities of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , except that widening of the distribution function for ions in @xmath168 direction ( panel f ) is now symmetric .",
    "but for the run 2.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , compared to fig .  [ fig6 ] , the following modifications can be observed : because there is no continuous energy input into the system , and we rather deal with initial value problem according to equation  [ eq4 ] , there is monotonous increase in particle energy , while electromagnetic energy energy does not increase and it only decreases .",
    "the total energy line is nearly flat this due to the fact that the energy error is 0.0009% .",
    "run 3 is our best attempt to launch a single gaussian pulse that propagates in the positive x - direction .",
    "this is achieved by the initial condition specified above . in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] we plot time evolution of phase mixed electromagnetic components @xmath75 and @xmath74 in a similar manner as in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we see from these panels that a single , gaussian pulse is excited moving to the right ( positive x - direction ) , only a minor backwards propagating pulse is visible in two bottom right panels near @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "but for the run 3 .",
    "here the numerical fit produces the following scaling law @xmath207.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] we plot the pulse amplitude dynamics as in fig .  [ fig4 ] but for the run 3 . in this case",
    "the numerical fit produces the scaling law of @xmath207 .",
    "again , this exponent is note quite @xmath202 but tolerably close .",
    "[ fig15 ] panel ( a ) shows that as the time progresses the pump in the parallel electron distribution function develops is single pump corresponding to the positive velocity of the gaussian pulse @xmath208 .",
    "we explain this by the fact the in run 3 only one pulse is present that moves to positive x - direction .",
    "this is an interesting result partly because now we see bump only in the positive velocities , contrary to our earlier works .",
    "this serves a further proof that the particle acceleration is via landau resonance damping .        for run 3",
    "the behaviour of the energies is similar to run 1 , so no shown here  particle energy increases on the expense of the decrease of magnetic energy as the pulse damps .",
    "the total energy line is nearly flat this due to the fact that the energy error is 0.02% .",
    "in figure  [ fig16 ] we plot distribution function time evolution for run1c .",
    "it is worthwhile to note the wider spread of red curve in panel ( a ) compared to panel ( a ) from figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "this means that in cooler background plasma with @xmath209 ( note that all other runs in this work have three times higher temperature of @xmath210 ) .",
    "we gather from panel ( h ) that @xmath157 index starts from @xmath164 and stops at @xmath211 , meaning that @xmath212 , i.e. 1.3% of electrons are accelerated above thermal speeds . for ions",
    "this number is about three times as large ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "we have advanced the knowledge of dynamics of alfven waves and associated particle acceleration in the inhomogeneous space and solar plasmas by considering new type of daw in a form of the gaussian pulses .",
    "the latter are more appropriate for solar flares , as the flare is impulsive in its nature .",
    "the new results can be summarised as following : ( i ) our linear analytical model makes a prediction that the pulse amplitude decrease is described by the linear kdv equation .",
    "( ii ) the numerical and analytical solution of the linear kdv equation shows the pulse amplitude damping in time as @xmath0 , which is corroborated by full pic simulations .",
    "( iii ) we also prove that the electron acceleration is due to collisionless landau damping .",
    "however , we would like to stress that the pulse amplitude decrease ( the @xmath0 scaling law ) is due to dispersive effects . in effect",
    ", section 3.1 shows that the phase - mixing leads to the dispersion , described by kdv equation , without resorting to the damping and wave - particle resonance .",
    "the dynamics of the particle distribution function in section 3.2 shows that the particle resonance is with the phase - mixed waves which have the phase speed of the daw pulse .",
    "( iv ) we show that reducing background plasma temperature yields more efficient particle acceleration .",
    "( v ) when we considered four times more massive ions with @xmath82 , compared to the most runs in this study with @xmath26 , this resulted in four times more efficient electron acceleration i.e. 4% . at this stage",
    "it is impossible for us to simulate the realistic mass ratio of @xmath200 due to the computational limitations .",
    "thus the jury is still out in the issue of feasibility of efficient electron acceleration by means of gaussian , alfvenic pulses .",
    "it should be noted that the issue of scaling of the generated @xmath11 and hence the particle acceleration with the mass ratio has been investigated before @xcite for the case of harmonic daw .",
    "ref.@xcite proved that the minimal model required to reproduce previous kinetic results on @xmath11 generation is the two - fluid , cold plasma approximation in the linear regime .",
    "ref.@xcite established that amplitude attained by @xmath11 decreases linearly as the inverse of the mass ratio @xmath214 , i.e. @xmath215 .",
    "this result contradicts the earlier works @xcite in that the cause of @xmath11 generation is the polarization drift of the driving wave , which scales as @xmath216 .",
    "increase in mass ratio does not have any effect on the final parallel ( magnetic field aligned ) speed attained by electrons .",
    "however , parallel ion velocity decreases linearly with the inverse of the mass ratio @xmath214 , i.e. the parallel velocity ratio of electrons and ions scales directly as @xmath214 .",
    "these were interpreted as follows : ( i ) ion dynamics plays no role in the @xmath11 generation ; ( ii ) decrease in the generated parallel electric field amplitude with the increase of the mass ratio @xmath214 is caused by the fact that the harmonic driving frequency @xmath217 is decreasing , and hence the electron fluid can effectively short - circuit ( recombine with ) the slowly oscillating ions , hence producing smaller @xmath11 which also scales exactly as @xmath218 .",
    "evidently , the same argument does not apply when harmonic daw is replaced by the gaussian pulse , which has no `` driving frequency '' associated with it .",
    "thus , further work is needed to investigate the scaling of the particle acceleration with the mass ratio .    yet",
    "another issue that needs to be mentioned is the fact that flaring solar coronal plasma has plasma beta possibly close to unity ( @xmath219 ) @xcite .",
    "whereas in our work most numerical runs are done for @xmath43 and one run with thus @xmath220 .",
    "we would like to remark that plasma conditions where the flare occurs and daw propagate can be quite different .",
    "once daw leave the flare cite with @xmath221 after their excitation , when rushing towards the footpoints , as sketched in figure [ fig1 ] , they will be moving through plasma with @xmath222 .",
    "as already stated above , a separate study needs to be conducted how particle acceleration efficiency scales with the mass ratio , i.e. different relations between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
