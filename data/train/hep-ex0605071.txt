    "@xmath0 violation in the standard model ( sm ) stems from an irreducible complex phase in the weak interaction @xmath4 quark - mixing ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite . applying the unitarity constraint , especially between the first and third generation , an equation @xmath5 , which can be depicted as an unitarity triangle in a complex plane ,",
    "is required to be satisfied .",
    "the key objective of b - factories  @xcite is to determine three angles or sides of this triangle .    at the b - factories ,",
    "it is predicted that a @xmath0 violating asymmetry lies in the time - dependent rates for @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays to a common @xmath0 eigenstate `` @xmath8 '' , which is generally written as : @xmath9    @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 is the decay rate for a @xmath14 to @xmath8 at a proper time @xmath15 after production , @xmath16 is the mass difference between the two @xmath6 mass eigenstates , @xmath17 is expressed as @xmath18 . ] and @xmath19 are expressed with a complex parameter , @xmath20 , that depends both on @xmath21 mixing and on the amplitudes for @xmath22 decay to @xmath0 eigenstates . in the sm , @xmath23 is equal to the absolute value of the ratio of the @xmath7 to @xmath24 decay amplitude to a good approximation .    in this letter ,",
    "the latest status of @xmath2 measurements are reported , here @xmath2 is the one of the angles of the unitarity triangle , performed at babar and belle experiments using @xmath3 decays .",
    "the determination of @xmath2 from @xmath25 decay modes , as typified by @xmath26 , provides the stringent constraint on the unitarity triangle at this stage . for these decay modes ,",
    "the @xmath0 violation parameters are rather precisely expressed as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 final state . using @xmath26 decays recorded in 386 m @xmath34 events ,",
    "belle has updated the results  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ belle - sin2phi1]a(c ) and b(d ) show the observed proper time distribution for @xmath35(@xmath36 ) and corresponding raw asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath0 violation parameters are determined by performing an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit to the proper time distributions .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath38 samples are combined with taking into account the @xmath0 eigenstates .",
    "the fit results are @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "babar has also measured these parameters with considering not only @xmath41 but also @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 decays observed in 227 m @xmath34 events  @xcite and determined to be , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the combined results from b - factories  @xcite ( summarized in fig .  [ wa - sin2phi1 ] ) are @xmath47    and show a good agreement with the sm expectations .",
    "the relative error for @xmath48 has reached less than 5% level .",
    "this fact allows us to test a new physics effect which would manifests itself in a loop - diagram such as @xmath49 penguin  @xcite .",
    "( @xmath36 ) at belle .",

    "the analyses for @xmath25 decay modes impose constraints on @xmath48 only and then lead to a four - fold ambiguity in the determination of @xmath2 .",
    "the next natural step is to reduce this ambiguity from four - fold to two - fold by measuring the sign of @xmath51 . for this purpose ,",
    "the following two methods have been performed .      because the @xmath52 mode is a pseudoscalar decay to two vector particles , interference between three helicity states with different @xmath0 eigenstates contributes to the @xmath0 violation parameters @xmath48 and @xmath51  @xcite . to extract these ,",
    "the complex transversity amplitudes of three helicity states and strong phase differences are necessary to be measured in advance .",
    "babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite have performed this analysis . in particular , babar has measured these through a time - integrated angular analysis of flavor specific decays , such as @xmath53 and @xmath54 modes recorded in 88 m @xmath34 events , considering the interference between s - wave and p - wave @xmath55 final states  @xcite . using these values ,",
    "then an unbinned maximum likelihood fit has been applied to the time - dependent angular distribution of the @xmath0 decay mode @xmath56 .",
    "the extracted @xmath57 and @xmath58 from this fit are ; @xmath59 when @xmath57 is fixed to 0.731 ( this was the world average as of this analysis ) , the resultant @xmath60 is obtained and the sign of @xmath58 is found to be positive at the 86% c.l .",
    "another technique of reducing @xmath2 ambiguity is based on the analysis of @xmath62 governed by the ckm favored @xmath63 transitions  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath64 means light neutral mesons .",
    "though the ckm suppressed @xmath65 decays contribute to these modes , the effect is small and can be taken into account .",
    "when @xmath66 decays to @xmath67 , a time dependent dalitz plot analysis of the neutral @xmath68 decay allows to determine @xmath2 directly .",
    "belle has performed an analysis for the decays @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and also for the @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) collected in 386 m @xmath34 events  @xcite .",
    "totally @xmath76 events were observed .",
    "an unbinned maximum likelihood fit has been applied to the observed time - dependent dalitz plot .",
    "the results are given in table  [ dalitz - table ] for each of the three final states separately .",
    "then the result of the simultaneous fit over all these modes is ;    @xmath77    the first error is statistical and the second is systematic .",

    "in particular , babar has performed a first measurement of @xmath0 asymmetries in the @xmath89 decay  @xcite .",
    "the measured values are @xmath90 and consistent again with the sm expectations within the currently large statistical uncertainty , that will be more precise in the future .",

    "the comparisons @xmath57 derived from @xmath25 modes with that from different quark transition , @xmath25 , also have been done , because a sizable @xmath0 asymmetry deviated from the sm expectation might be observed , if new physics beyond the sm exists . though these measurements are dominated by statistical uncertainties ,",
