    "the exchange of meson pairs plays an important role in hadron dynamics .",
    "the first meson exchange models of the two - nucleon interaction were based on the exchange of one meson only and had to introduce a scalar - isoscalar meson ( the sigma ) which is not seen as a resonance in the two - pion phase shifts and has remained a controversial issue @xcite .",
    "models of the two - nucleon interaction based on dispersion relations show that the sigma meson can be understood as an effective degree of freedom which parameterizes the exchange of two pions @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of this approach leads to the inclusion of @xmath0 correlations in the @xmath2-channel @xcite .",
    "in addition to the exchange of two pions , the exchange of a pion - rho pair is necessary to describe the phase shifts , in particular near the pion production threshold @xcite .",
    "correlated two - pion exchange has been incorporated in meson - theoretic models of both pion - nucleon @xcite and kaon - nucleon scattering @xcite . in these calculations ambiguities in the",
    "dispersion theoretic approach @xcite to the correlated two - meson exchange in the @xmath2 channel were encountered .",
    "exchange is defined by integrating right hand cuts only @xcite . by leaving out contributions from the left hand cuts ,",
    "the mentioned ambiguities arise . ]",
    "the quantitative effect of these ambiguities is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figcoupl ] , where we show the vector and tensor @xmath5 coupling as calculated using different dispersion relation formulations @xcite . given the important role of correlated two - meson exchanges in many different hadronic reactions , one is compelled to address the question which of the various dispersion relation formulations is preferred . in order to answer this question , we calculate the correlated @xmath0 exchange , not in the framework of dispersion relations , which suffer from the problem of being ambiguous , but in a formulation based on spectral functions .    we introduce this method in the next section using the @xmath3 potential due to correlated @xmath0 exchange in the @xmath1 channel as an example , which is simpler than the exchange in the @xmath2 channel . in the third section we deal with the construction of the potential in the @xmath2 channel and",
    "discuss the problem of differing results in the dispersion relation approach .",
    "the last section summarizes our results .",
    "in order to extract the dynamical information from the transfer matrix in both channels , @xmath4 ( hereafter called the @xmath6-channel ) and @xmath7 ( hereafter called the @xmath8-channel ) , one must first decompose the @xmath9-matrix into well - defined operators and amplitudes that contain the dynamics of the reaction .",
    "the most familiar amplitudes in this respect are the @xmath10 amplitudes ( see fig .",
    "[ figspec ] ) introduced by frazer and fulco @xcite , which we will use as input for our calculations .",
    "the details of this decomposition are given in the appendix [ zerleg ] .",
    "our starting point for the construction of the correlated @xmath0 exchange is the lagrangian @xmath11 we use derivative coupling at the @xmath12 vertex to ensure chiral symmetry . from this lagrangian",
    "we calculate a @xmath3 potential @xmath13 where the propagator @xmath14 depends on the theoretical framework in which one is working . in a covariant approach",
    "the propagator is @xmath15 our notation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fignot ] in the appendix .",
    "the potential @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of the invariant amplitudes @xmath17 and @xmath18 defined in the appendix : @xmath19    in order to obtain an idea of how to proceed , let us look again at the spectral functions in fig .",
    "[ figspec ] .",
    "the two spectral functions of the @xmath2 channel suggest a breit - wigner parameterization of a resonance .",
    "the width of such a resonance is the decay width of the particle .",
    "if the particle is stable the width is zero , resulting in a delta function located at the mass squared of the particle .",
    "the spectral functions @xmath20 can then be regarded as mass distributions of an unstable particle .",
    "we can then incorporate the width of the @xmath1 meson into our amplitudes by exchanging a continuum of @xmath1 mesons with different masses @xmath21 , with amplitudes weighted according to the spectral function .",
    "this can be cast in spectral form @xcite : @xmath22 where the spectral function is normalized according to @xmath23    all that we need do is calculate the spectral function @xmath24 .",
    "we do this by relating the spectral function to the dressed @xmath1 propagator , @xmath25 , via @xmath26 in order to extract the @xmath1 propagator , we express the @xmath27 amplitudes of eq .",
    "( [ ampfsigma ] ) as a @xmath1 pole diagram with a dressed propagator , @xmath28 , which contains all the @xmath0 dynamics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figpic ] .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath29    the spectral function is then given by @xmath30 from which we obtain the amplitude @xmath31 : @xmath32 here we have used the relation @xmath33 and the definition of the on shell momentum @xmath34 and changed the variable of integration from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "this enables us to compare our expression directly with the results of the dispersion theoretical approach of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath37 the tilde is used only as a reminder that this is a result from dispersion theory .    in comparing the two results , eq .",
    "( [ ressigma ] ) derived by using the spectral function and eq .",
    "( [ sigschuetz ] ) calculated within the framework of dispersion relations , we find differences only in the factor in front of the integral : @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ ressigma ] ) and @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ sigschuetz ] ) . for on - shell amplitudes ,",
    "these two terms agree .",
    "therefore the on - shell amplitudes of both methods are the same , as it must be .",
    "off - shell , however , they are very different , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figfaktor ] .",
    "if one wishes to use this amplitude as a potential in a scattering equation or as an off - shell @xmath3 amplitude in another reaction , care must be taken to use a potential with an off - shell behavior that is compatible with the off - shell behavior of other diagrams ( e.g. nucleon exchange ) .",
    "the off - shell behavior can be implemented easily in eq .",
    "( [ ressigma ] ) , because here only the momenta of the two pions appear and the off - shell prescription of these momenta is given by the formalism used to solve the scattering equation for which the correlated @xmath0 exchange serves as a potential .",
    "the importance of a proper off - shell behavior of the @xmath3 amplitude constructed in a dispersion theoretical way is also pointed out in the calculation of the @xmath40 vertex in ref .",
    "there the authors prescribe the off - shell behavior of the correlated two pion exchange by comparing the amplitude to the field theoretical amplitude for the exchange of a stable particle .",
    "the fact that the on - shell amplitudes , which are the ones we are interested in at the moment , are the same with both methods shows that our method leads to correct results where dispersion theory is applicable .",
    "this observation encourages us to proceed in the calculation of the correlated @xmath0 exchange in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "let us start this section by taking a closer look at the source of the difference displayed in fig .",
    "[ figcoupl ] .",
    "the coupling constants shown there are calculated by using different dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "the dashed lines were calculated by using the amplitudes @xmath41 which we get by writing dispersion relations for @xmath42 and @xmath43 separately and inserting these into eq .",
    "( [ ampfrho ] ) .    a different way was originally suggested by frazer and fulco @xcite and later applied by hhler and pietarinen @xcite to a calculation of the the @xmath5 couplings .",
    "they define the combinations @xmath44 for which dispersion relation are written .",
    "this leads to the amplitudes @xmath45 and to the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ figcoupl ] .",
    "note that the factor @xmath46 does not generate a pole at @xmath47 since the @xmath10 amplitudes obey the relation @xcite @xmath48    yet another possibility was suggested by j.m .",
    "richard @xcite .",
    "he defines two amplitudes @xmath49 and formulates a subtracted dispersion relation for @xmath50 and an unsubtracted dispersion relation for @xmath51 @xmath52 since @xmath53 the amplitude @xmath54 ( and therefore the tensor coupling ) is the same as in eq .",
    "[ dispgamma ] .",
    "the amplitude @xmath55 , however , reads now @xmath56 and leads to a different vector coupling , shown in fig .",
    "[ figcoupl ] .",
    "the fact that these three alternatives lead to very different amplitudes can be seen directly by comparing the eqs .",
    "( [ dispf ] ) , ( [ dispgamma ] ) , and ( [ dispgh ] ) .",
    "one can see for example , that the factor @xmath46 appears in front of the dispersion relation integral over the @xmath10 amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ dispf ] ) , whereas it is absorbed in the definition of the @xmath57 amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ dispgamma ] ) .",
    "of course this influences the convergence of the dispersion integrals which causes the differences between the couplings displayed in fig .",
    "[ figcoupl ] .",
    "these are the ambiguities mentioned above .",
    "let us now calculate the @xmath2 exchange by using the spectral function approach we have introduced in section [ secsig ] .",
    "the calculation of the amplitudes in the @xmath2 channel proceeds along the same lines as outlined in the previous section .",
    "the lagrangian we start with is @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) . from this",
    "we calculate the invariant amplitudes @xmath60 which we have to weight with a spectral function to get the correlated @xmath0 exchange .    the two coupling schemes of the @xmath2 to the nucleon as given in eq .",
    "( [ lagrho ] ) , manifest themselves in two spectral functions which must be calculated from the two amplitudes @xmath43 and @xmath42 by using eq .",
    "( [ ampfrho ] ) , but how to assign the propagators ( spectral functions ) is not yet clear",
    ". we could either define ( a ) separate spectral functions for the amplitudes @xmath17 and @xmath18 or ( b ) spectral functions for the vector and tensor part of the coupling .",
    "* by using the _ ansatz _ @xmath61 the first method leads us to the spectral functions @xmath62 which we now use to construct the amplitude for correlated @xmath0 exchange via @xmath63 we finally obtain for the amplitudes @xmath64 * the different momentum dependence of the vector and tensor coupling as given in eq . ( [ lagrho ] ) may lead to different dressing of these couplings in expressing the amplitude by a dressed propagator ( as displayed in fig .",
    "[ figpic ] ) .",
    "the second possibility of defining spectral functions for the vector and tensor coupling takes this into account and leads us to a system of coupled equations @xmath65 solving this system of popagators and using the definiton of the spectral function given in eq .",
    "( [ propspec ] ) as well as the relations @xmath66 for integrating over the @xmath2 mass distribution we get @xmath67 where we have written our result also in terms of the @xmath57 amplitudes defined in eq .",
    "( [ gammaamp ] ) + the amplitude @xmath55 can be reduced further by using @xmath68 to give @xmath69    as can be seen by comparing @xmath54 from eq .",
    "( [ abtwo ] ) and @xmath55 from eq .",
    "( [ finalb ] ) with the amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ abone ] ) both methods lead to the same amplitudes .",
    "therefore it does not matter how we assign the propagators to the different amplitudes or coupling schemes ; they all lead to the same result .",
    "this makes our prescription for calculating the correlated @xmath0 exchange in the @xmath2 channel _",
    "unambiguous_.    in comparing the amplitudes from the dispersion relation approach and the amplitudes from our approach using the spectral functions , we see , that the amplitudes of eq .",
    "( [ dispgamma ] ) generated by the dispersion over the @xmath57 amplitudes are in complete agreement with our amplitudes from eq .",
    "( [ abtwo ] ) .",
    "furthermore we recognize , that the only difference between our amplitudes from eq .",
    "( [ abone ] ) and the amplitudes from dispersing the @xmath10 amplitudes of eq .",
    "( [ dispf ] ) is the position of the term @xmath46 . in our case",
    "this term appears inside the integration whereas in eq .",
    "( [ dispf ] ) it appears in front of the integral . a dispersion relation over the amplitudes @xmath70 would therefore lead also to the eq .",
    "( [ dispgamma ] ) .",
    "the dispersion relation over @xmath70 was done for the @xmath1 exchange right from the beginning , since the known ( model dependent ) part of the @xmath71 amplitude does not have the necessary asymptotic behavior as @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have introduced an alternative method for the construction of amplitudes for the correlated @xmath0 exchange that does not suffer from ambiguities of the @xmath2 exchange in approaches through dispersion relations . in the @xmath1 channel",
    "our result agrees completely with the on - shell results from dispersion theory , however by starting from a field theoretically constructed potential , our approach removes ambiguities in the construction of the off shell amplitudes .    in the @xmath2",
    "channel the source of ambiguity in the coupling constants is traced to the choice whether to perform a dispersion relation over the amplitudes @xmath10 or the ratio @xmath70 .",
    "the latter choice agrees completely with dispersion relations over the @xmath57 amplitudes used by hhler and pietarinen .",
    "our approach solves the problem of non - uniqueness and yields amplitudes that are in complete agreement with the results from dispersion relations over the @xmath57 amplitudes for on - shell processes .",
