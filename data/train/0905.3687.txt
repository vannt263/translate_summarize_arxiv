    "the results of this combined analysis supported the ag75 solution and appeared to rule out the smaller amplitude values from st95 .",

    "while they did not observe this effect , they did note several issues that are illuminating .",
    "first , their orbital elements ( specifically semiamplitudes ) vary depending upon which lines were used , i.e. , the @xmath6 values from lines were smaller than those from .",
    "second , the equivalent widths of two lines are phase locked with the orbital motion .",
    "they are at maximum strength when the back ( opposite the companion ) of the star is facing towards us and at a minimum half a orbit later .",
    "they conclude that the lines preferentially form over a portion of the stellar surface , and possibly an analogous , but opposite , effect may be occuring with the uv lines , due to mutual irradiation of the inner sides of the stars .    as one of only a few contact massive binaries ,",
    "the tu mus system is an important test case for interactive binary evolution models .",
    "it is critical that well - determined values for the current separation and component masses be determined . in this paper",
    "we present our own analysis of the _ iue _ observations of hd  100213 resulting in a double - lined orbital solution (  3 ) , our tomographic reconstruction of the composite spectra into separate primary and secondary spectra and their respective spectral classifications (  5 ) , individual projected rotational velocities (  4 ) , and our model of the eclipsing light curve (  6 ) .",
    "we discuss the discrepancy between the orbital semiamplitudes determined from optical spectra versus those from uv spectra in  7 .",
    "we compare the individual masses based on the spectroscopic and photometric orbits to those predicted by theoretical methods and discuss their implications (  8) .",
    "there are 24 high dispersion , short wavelength prime camera spectra of hd  100213 available from _ iue_. these spectra were obtained from multi - mission archive at space telescope science institute ( _ mast _ ) .",

    "this spectrum was not used for our analysis .",
    "the individual swp image numbers and heliocentric julian dates of mid - exposure of the remaining 23 observations are presented in table  1 .",
    "the spectra were manipulated in several stages to produce a matrix of spectra ( in dimensions of wavelength and time ) rectified using a common set of relatively line - free zones and sampled with a uniform @xmath8 wavelength grid .",

    "details are given in @xcite .",
    "radial velocities and orbital elements based on this same set of spectra were presented by st95 . however , we decided to check their results using our suite of cross - correlation techniques to obtain radial velocities and estimates of projected rotational velocities and flux ratio ( for details see * ? ? ?",

    "the relative velocities were determined by fitting two gaussians to the composite cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) .",
    "the widths of the two gaussians and their intensity ratio were determined by least - squares fits of ccfs with well - separated peaks , i.e. , those obtained within @xmath11 of the quadrature phases .",
    "the final radial velocities ( table  1 ) were transformed from relative to absolute by adding the radial velocity of hd  34078 ( + 54.4 km  s@xmath10 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite investigated possible cyclical variations in orbital period of tu mus and suggested that there is a tertiary companion .",
    "the predicted low mass of this star , @xmath12 , indicates that it will not significantly contribute to the _ iue _ spectra .",
    "in addition there is a well known faint companion , with a magnitude @xmath13 , that is located 15@xmath14 to the southwest of tu mus , but we see no evidence of any tertiary spectrum in our ccfs .",
    "we determined the orbital elements using the program ( sbcm ) of @xcite .",
    "this program is limited to individual solutions for the component stars .",
    "we assigned zero weight to those velocities obtained from spectra within about 0.15 phase of the minima of eclipse and 1.0 weight on all other observations .",

    "the combined primary and secondary solutions of st95 and t03 are presented along with the separate primary and secondary solutions from this paper .",

    "our results are not in agreement with those from t03 who find significantly higher orbital semi - amplitude velocities for both stars . as noted above the disagreement between orbital semi - amplitude values determined from uv spectra and those from optical spectra",
    "is not unique to tu mus .",

    "all the roche filling components have lower derived @xmath6 values from the ultraviolet analysis when compared to the optical .",

    "the separate primary and secondary star spectra can be derived using a tomography algorithm to reconstruct the individual spectra from the ensemble of composite spectra .",
    "the algorithm is described in detail in a separate paper ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we have commented on some limitations of the algorithm previously @xcite , but we note here that strong wind features , such as the p cygni lines , may be reconstructed incorrectly since their radial velocity curves can be very different from those associated with the stars themselves . since the tomographic reconstruction is based on orbital doppler shifts , the reconstruction will be ambiguous in the vicinity of such wind features .",
    "the tomographic reconstruction of the primary and secondary spectra is based on the assumed flux ratio which may not be well determined at the outset .",
    "the composite spectra are first separated using the ccf intensity ratios of @xmath29 as an initial estimate of the uv flux ratios .",
    "the resultant individual stellar spectra are then classified . for the spectra of the primary and secondary we use the spectral diagnostics listed below .",
    "we can then determine the true uv intensity ratio by numerical tests involving the cross - correlation of the template with a simulated binary spectrum formed from spectra of stars of the same spectral types as the primary and the secondary , with a range of input flux ratios ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "for the case of tu mus ( o7 v + o8 v ) , our measured ccf intensity ratio is @xmath30 using the template star , hd  34078 ( o9.5 v ) .",
    "we found that we could match this ratio by combining the spectra of the single stars hd  36879 ( as the primary , o7 v ) and hd 48279 ( as the secondary , o8 v ) using a uv flux ratio , @xmath31 .",
    "our method for estimating the spectral types and luminosity classes of the separated primary and secondary spectra is based on the equivalent width measurements of several uv absorption lines ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "we identify the two stars as o7 v ( o6.5  o7.5 ) and o8 v ( o7.5  o9 ) based on an evaluation of the following criteria : for the primary the equivalent widths of four lines ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ) ; and for the secondary the same set plus @xmath36 and the line ratio of @xmath33/ @xmath36 .",
    "these classifications are , for the most part , consistent with walborn s ( 1971 ) composite classification of o8.5 v. @xcite estimated the types as o7.8 + o8.2 , which again agree well with our determinations .",
    "these spectral types correspond to temperatures @xcite of @xmath37 kk and @xmath38 kk .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ light curve @xcite shows two equally spaced minima of what appears to be @xmath39 in _ hipparcos _ magnitude .",
    "we obtained , in electronic form , the ag75 differential photometric data from j. v. clausen and j. andersen .",
    "these observations show that in fact the primary eclipse is slightly deeper , @xmath40 magnitude ( in @xmath41 ) .",
    "both sets of data also have ellipsoidal variations present between eclipses due to the tidal distortion of the stars inside the roche surfaces .",
    "we note that the time of minimum light for the _ hipparcos _ observations is shifted in phase by 0.028 compared to that of ag75 .",
    "this is part of a larger trend examined by @xcite and @xcite suggesting that the period of tu mus is lengthening due to slow mass transfer from the secondary to the primary . for the purpose of simultaneously fitting the _ hipparcos _ and ag75 data ,",
    "we calculated the phases of the photometric data using our final spectroscopic period and the time of primary minimum from the individual data sets themselves ( i.e. , the _ hipparcos _ epoch of minimum light was taken as the time of the faintest observation ) .",
    "the differential @xmath41 band photometry of ag75 was transformed to _",
    "hipparcos _ magnitude system ( almost identical to @xmath41 for hot stars ) and are plotted in figure 2 . both the shapes and depths of the eclipses and the ellipsoidal variations are dependent upon the stellar radii and orbital inclination .",
    "we used the light curve synthesis code gensyn @xcite to produce @xmath41 differential light curves .",
    "as t03 mention there is a faint visual companion to the system 15@xmath14 to the sw which was included in both the _ hipparcos _ and ag75 photometry .",
    "the visual magnitude of the companion from the guide star catalog is @xmath42 .",
    "this represents @xmath43 of the measured light , which we removed before fitting the light curve .",
    "the orbital parameters were taken from our above solution , and the physical fluxes and limb darkening coefficients were taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we neglect any treatment of radiation pressure following the suggestion of @xcite .",
    "rotation rates were determined using the model inclination and radii plus the projected rotational velocities given above . making a fit of the observed light curve",
    "requires estimates of many parameters , and initially we decided to constrain all the orbital parameters according to our spectroscopic orbit , set the stellar temperatures according to the spectral classifications ( @xmath44  kk , @xmath45  kk ) , and determine the ratio of radii from the visual flux ratio , @xmath46 ( determined from the method described in penny et al .",
    "1997 to be @xmath30 ) .",
    "then , each model light curve is a function of the remaining two parameters , inclination and primary polar radius .",
    "there are three characteristics of the light curve that we sought to match : eclipse depth , eclipse duration , and amplitude of the ellipsoidal variation . in order to fit the observed difference in depth between the primary and secondary eclipse , the primary s ( secondary s ) temperature was increased ( decreased ) to its highest ( lowest ) possible value , @xmath47  kk , @xmath48  kk .",
    "the critical issue in matching eclipse depths is the temperature difference between the two stars , not their actual values .",
    "( of course the actual values of @xmath49 do have a large effect upon the calculated absolute magnitude of the system . )",
    "the ellipsoidal variations are a sensitive function of assumed stellar radii , we found that models with the correct ellipsoidal variation depth _ and _ eclipse duration and depth had inclinations @xmath50 . the best - fit model light curve ( for @xmath51.7 ) is illustrated in figure  2 . in this model",
    "the stars are just in contact , both filling their roche surfaces .",
    "the larger inclination value of @xmath52 fit the eclipse depths very well , but the ellipsoidal variations were too small .",
    "below @xmath53 the widths of the eclipses become too broad and shallow . at the higher inclination ,",
    "both stars are just inside their roche volumes and at the lower , they are in slight overcontact .",
    "the presence of the ellipsoidal variations in conjunction with eclipses make this inclination determination very precise .",
    "our best - fit inclination value agrees extremely well with the inclination presented by t03 , who find an @xmath54 .",
    "we caution against their small quoted errors .",
    "no doubt these are statistical in nature , however they can be misleading . to demonstrate we plot the secondary eclipse with our nominal best fit model ( @xmath55 ) , and",
    "our maximum and minimum inclination model fits ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) in figure 3 .",
    "all three fit the data very well . owing to the smaller @xmath6 values from our spectroscopic orbit , our estimates for the resulting separation and radii are quite different from that of t03 .",
    "the radii at the best fit inclination are @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "based on our @xmath26 values , the equatorial rotation speeds of the two stars are @xmath60 km s@xmath10 and @xmath61 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the synchronous rotation rates , calculated using the equatorial radii , are @xmath62 and @xmath63 km  s@xmath10 , for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "these agree within our errors , and both stars are rotating at or slightly above synchronous . to determine the distance",
    "to tu mus we use the combined absolute magnitude of the pair from our light curve model , @xmath64 .",
    "we note that t03 s use of absolute magnitudes from a calibration of spectral class to absolute magnitude is far less accurate .",
    "in fact their own light curve analysis produces @xmath65 values ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) that are incompatible with their adopted absolute magnitudes ( which correspond to @xmath65 values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "we adopt a visual absorption value of @xmath70 and an apparent visual magntude of @xmath71 in accordance with ag75 .",
    "we determine a distance of @xmath72 kpc , which agrees within errors with that from ag75 , but which is much smaller than @xmath73 kpc found by t03 .",
    "our distance places the system in the nearby portion of the carina spiral arm @xcite .",
    "from our combined spectroscopic and photometric analysis we have a complete model of the tu mus binary .",
    "we can now attempt to quantify why the optical and uv radial velocities result in disparate @xmath6 values .",
    "we considered several effects .",
    "the first is the shift of the the stars centers of light from their centers of mass .",
    "we used gensyn to produce synthetic line profiles of typical uv and optical lines at photometric phase = 0.25 , with a center of mass velocity of zero . at this orbital phase",
    ", the absolute values of the radial velocities of the component stars should be equal to their semi - amplitude values . to create model line profiles",
    ", gensyn requires unbroadened line profiles for the both the primary and secondary .",
    "we adopt @xmath74 as our typical optical line .",
    "the synthetic input flux profiles were obtained from the ostar2002 grid of @xcite using effective temperatures from our best fit light curve model , @xmath75  k , @xmath76  k , and @xmath77 for both stars .",
    "our measured uv radial velocities are not from individual line profiles , but from a cross correlation of the spectrum of hd  34078 with the observed binary spectra .",
    "we cross - correlated uv spectra from ostar2002 with our template hd  34078 and used the resulting ccfs as our input uv line profiles .",
    "radial velocities were obtained by fitting double gaussians to the inverted uv and optical gensyn created profiles and are presented in table 3 . neither the uv nor the optical appear to be significantly affected by the non - sphericity of their shape ( case 1 ) .",
    "the resultant velocities although slightly smaller are well within the measuring error of the expected semi - amplitude values .",
    "next we considered how the inner hemispheres of the components are heated by irradiation from the companion star , by setting the number of reflection iterations in gensyn to equal five ( case 2 ) .",
    "this had again a small effect on the measured radial velocities and not in a manner that addresses the @xmath6 disparity , as both the uv and the optical lines are shifted towards the binary center of mass .",
    "this is not surprising given that at both wavelengths higher temperatures mean increased luminosity and a greater shift of the line center .",
    "next we considered whether absorption lines formed primarily in hotter regions , such as uv lines , would more preferentially form in these inner hotter hemispheres , resulting in lower @xmath6 values .",
    "an additional input to gensyn does allow us to specify how the primary and secondary line profiles vary with increasing temperature .",
    "we again used the ostar2002 grid to quantify how the strength of the input lines change with temperature and we created an additional set of binary synthetic profiles with all three effects ( roche geometry , irradiation , line variability ) .",
    "a temperature increase of 1000 degrees is expected to cause a decrease in @xmath74 equivalent width of 9% while the predicted change is a decrease of 3% for the uv ccfs .",
    "disapointingly , the changes are too small to alter significantly the measured radial velocities .",
    "one last effect we consider is how the heating of the inner hemisphere reduces the temperature gradient in the upper atmosphere .",
    "line depth is a function of the difference in temperature between the depths where the continuum and the line are formed , and in general , the larger the difference , the deeper the line .",
    "uv lines are high excitation features that are formed at depths comparable to the continuum . optical lines , on the other hand , are lower excitation features that form at much higher levels .",
    "but in cases where irradiation from above occurs , the temperature where optical lines form will be higher than normal , thus reducing the line contrast .",
    "in this situation , optical lines formed on the inner , illuminated hemisphere will appear weaker while lines formed on the outer hemisphere have normal strength , and this shifts the effective line center away from the center of mass , leading to larger @xmath6 values .",
    "this effect would not so greatly change the uv line contrast as they are already formed at temperatures close to that of the continuum depth .",
    "we suggest that this may be the cause of the larger semi - amplitude values from optical lines . without an accuate model of how irradiation changes the temperature gradient in the upper atmosphere",
    "it is difficult to quantify this effect .",
    "however in a previous study on the struve - sahade ( ss ) effect , @xcite investigated the effects of increased wind - blanketing on the temperature gradient , and subsequent line strengths , for the secondary star in ao cas .",
    "lines from transistions that tend to decrease in strength with temperature were not as strong , while those transitions that increased with temperature were either unchanged or intensified .",
    "while the uv and lines are somewhat affected by the increase in external heating , the largest impact is in the features .",
    "the largest effect can be seen in their figure 5 , where the @xmath78 feature is drastically diminished . in their case",
    ", they argue that a colliding bow shock region near the surface of secondary , creates heating on the approaching hemisphere of that star which is seen as the ss - effect .",
    "for our situation , only the inner regions of the stars would be heated from irradiation .",
    "we find observational support for this hypothesis in the recent paper by l07 in their measured equivalent width values for two lines , @xmath79 and @xmath74 . in both cases",
    "the lines variations are phase locked , with maximum values at phases when we see the outer hemisphere of the stars .",
    "this ia consistent with the idea that the optical lines formed where irradiation from the companion is significant will be weakened by the decrease in atmospheric temperature gradient .",
    "l07 also suggest that there may be a similar but opposite effect in the uv spectra . in order to determine",
    "if this is indeed the case we measured the ` equivalent widths ' of our ccf primary and secondary peaks at phases out of eclipse , see figure 4 .",
    "if contributions to the uv ccfs were larger from the inner irradiated regions we would expect the primary to appear strongest at phase 0.25 and the secondary at phase 0.75 . unlike the lines there",
    "does not appear to be a correlation between line strength and orbital phase , which suggests that the uv lines form more or less uniformly around th stars .",
    "it is difficult to determine the actual optical depth of formation for any particular line , but they should scale with excitation and ionization potentials .",
    "the lines examined by l07 are from electron transistions from the first excited level ( with an excitation potential of 21 ev ) and these have the largest @xmath6 values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the ionization potential between and is slightly higher at 24.6 ev and from the l07 analysis , the @xmath6 values for lines are lower at @xmath82 and @xmath83 km s@xmath10 .",
    "finally , the uv spectra from which we obtain our semiamplitudes , @xmath84 and @xmath85 km s@xmath10 , are predominantly populated with lines from and with ionization potentials of 30.7 and 54.8 ev .",
    "it appears that the use of low excitation lines in contact systems where irradiation effects are present leads to overestimates of the semi - amplitude values and hence to the overall size and masses of the system .",
    "it is clear from this analysis that the uv derived orbital elements are more representative of the true dynamic motion of the system .",
    "our goal in this research has been to compare the masses obtained from observations with those found from theoretical evolutionary tracks , however since both stars of tu mus are roche filling , we should not necessarily expect agreement with single star tracks . in this case",
    "we will also compare the component stars to models produced from interacting binary models .",
    "the observational masses can be determined from the combination of results from the spectroscopic and photometric orbits ( @xmath86 sin@xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "masses from evolutionary theories require the individual temperatures and luminosities of the two stars , i.e. , placing the individual component stars in the h - r diagram .",
    "we can estimate temperatures from calibrations of spectral type , and we can calculate luminosities from the observed flux ratio and the absolute magnitude of the binary ( from the stellar radii associated with fits of the light curve ) .",
    "individual visual magnitudes of the component stars can be obtained from the visual flux ratio of the two stars and the adopted @xmath89 above . once individual visual magnitudes are obtained , we convert them to bolometric magnitudes and luminosities with bolometric corrections from @xcite .",
    "our calculated visual flux ratio is @xmath90 .",
    "the luminosities and radii derived are @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "our results are plotted in the h - r diagram in figure  5 together with evolutionary tracks for single massive stars from @xcite . at this point in our analysis",
    "we typically compare the stellar positions with the evolutionary tracks and determine what masses they would predict .    combining the light curve model with the results from the spectroscopic orbit results in observational masses of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "masses predicted from single star evolutionary tracks are significantly higher , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "of course since both stars are in roche lobe contact , we would not expect them to have evolved as single objects .",
    "the severe overluminosity of these roche filling stars is in agreement with other interacting massive binaries , specifically hd  115071 , hd  36486 , hd  35652 , hd  209481 , bd+66@xmath951521 , hd  228854 , hd  190967 , hd  106871 , and hd  35921 .",
    "these systems are listed in table 4 , along with their individual periods , mass ratios , component spectral classes , evolutionary masses from single star tracks , and dynamical masses .",
    "an interacting massive binary is a complicated beast .",
    "trying to determine how it got to its current state is a little like trying to unspill milk .",
    "one method is to compare its current state with other similar systems . interacting massive binaries fall into two broad categories : semi - detached and contact .",
    "its interesting to note that in all but one of the semi - detached systems in table 4 , it is the secondary that is in rlof . in the case",
    "a ( donor star still in core hydrogen burning , chb ) scenario , the radius of the initially more massive star slowly reaches its roche surface as it evolves along the main sequence . the initially lower mass star , due to its slower evolution",
    ", is not the first to overflow . applying this to the semi - detached systems we infer that the current mass loser ( or secondary ) was initially the more massive object .",
    "the period of a binary will shrink during mass transfer as long as the more massive star is losing mass .",
    "after enough mass has been transferred to ` flip ' the mass ratio , the separation between the stars will increase allowing rlof to cease . that we mainly see systems with the less massive object in rlof",
    "agrees with theoretical predictions ( wlb01 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the initial transfer of mass is exceedingly quick ( fast case a ) , but that the turning off of slow mass transfer ( slow case a ) may take a considerable amount of time",
    ". the mass ratios of these semi - detached systems range from @xmath96 , indicating that there has been significant mass lost from the intially more massive star .",
    "unfortunately only one of the semi - detached systems , hd  209481 , was observed by @xcite in her survey of h@xmath97 emission in close , o - type star binaries .",
    "it did not have strong the h@xmath97 emission that is associated with large rlof gas streams .",
    "again this suggests that although the secondary is filling its roche volume , there is not a significant amount of mass being transferred at this time .",
    "if the semi - detached systems are the expected result when the intially more massive star in a binary evolves to reach its roche radius , what scenario leads to a contact system ? the are some obvious differences between the two groups .",
    "the observed mass ratios for the three contact systems in table 4 are slightly higher ( @xmath98 ) than those of the semi - detached systems ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the components are also more closely matched , within one spectral type of each other and with similar luminosity classifications .",
    "wlb01 present evolutionary calculations for 74 close binary systems , with masses ranging from @xmath100 for case a and b scenarios . on the basis of our derived luminosity classes ( both stars are v ) and the @xmath101 values determined from our light curve analysis ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 )",
    ", we expect that hd  100213 is undergoing case a evolution . according to the wlb01 models , case a contact systems can occur when the initial period of the system is very small and/or when the mass ratio , @xmath104 , is either very small or very large . for a short period system , the initially more massive star reaches its roche radius fairly early in its evolution .",
    "if its companion has much less mass than itself ( @xmath105 ) the ensuing mass transfer will proceed very rapidly as the exhange of any mass reduces the period causing the loser star to overflow at a faster rate .",
    "the combination of the large increase in mass of the gainer star and the smaller orbit causes it to expand and reach its roche volume .",
    "if the companion has a mass similar to the loser star ( @xmath106 ) , it will gain a much smaller amount of material from mass transfer . in this case",
    "only a small mass transfer will ` flip ' the mass ratio .",
    "however the increase in mass will cause the gainer star to ` rejuvenate ' .",
    "rejuvenation is when the star adapts its convective core mass to its new total mass @xcite .",
    "the new larger mass gainer star begins to evolve at a faster pace than its companion and reaches its roche limit . the state of the gainer star ( original secondary ) when it reaches its roche volume determines whether the contact state is called case aa ( secondary still in chb ) or case ab ( secondary between chb and cheb ) . in case ab the mass transfer rate is very large as the star is rapidly increasing in radii .",
    "this exchange happens quickly and will increase the orbital period and separation significantly .    for hd  100213",
    "we suggest the following scenario .",
    "the two stars began with a mass ratio very close to unity and a period slightly smaller than the current value .",
    "the actual initial masses and period depend upon how much of the lost mass is transferred .",
    "the initially more massive star reaches its roche volume and mass is transferred to the gainer star .",
    "the stars move closer together for a brief time until the gainer star is more massive .",
    "mass transfered after this point causes the stars to move further from one another , however this does not cease the rlof .",
    "fast case a mass transfer continues and does nt end until the loser star is much less massive .",
    "wlb01 explain that since the @xmath107 is increasing for the loser star this causes its radius to increase .",
    "this agrees well with our observed mass ratio of @xmath108 .",
    "finally the gainer star expands due to the increase in mass and its rejuvenated interior until it also reaches its roche volume .",
    "this is current status of the binary .",
    "what is the current state of mass transfer ?",
    "@xcite examined the historical records ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ag75 , st95 , t03 ) and argue that the period of tu mus lengthens , but not regularly .",
    "another study by @xcite found a long term increase in period along with superimposed cyclical variations .",
    "the cyclical variations they attribute to the presence of a nearby ( @xmath109 au ) , low mass ( @xmath110 ) tertiary companion .",
    "they argue that the long term increase in the observed periods is consistent with a conservative mass transfer rate of @xmath111 yr@xmath10 from the lower mass secondary to the primary .",
    "@xcite observed hd  100213 looking for h@xmath97 emission , which we associate with mass transfer , and detected none .",
    "we suggest that the system is just barely in contact , with both stars still in a chb stage , case aa .",
    "we highly recommend that this rare contact system , now with well determined masses , radii , separation , and temperatures be modelled using binary evolutionary codes .",
    "@xcite also examined case a and b interacting systems and determined that those with small initial periods and small or large mass ratios will reach contact . however due to his differing treatment of convection , @xcite predicts that all gainer stars will reach contact through case ab .",
    "all gainer stars are quickly rejuvenated to the point that they reach the end of chb and then expand rapidly to contact .",
    "another issue this system can address is how much mass lost from the loser is accreted upon the gainer .",
    "both @xcite and wlb01 have treated the mass transfer as conservative , i.e. , all mass lost by the donor is accreted by the gainer .",
    "the mechanism for non - conservative mass transfer is the rapid spinning up of the gainer star until it reaches its critical rotation velocity @xcite .",
    "neither star in this system is near critical rotation , which suggests that the mass transfer has been conservative .",
    "what @xcite and wlb01 agree upon is the prediction that case a contact systems will end in a binary merger . both find that the resulting periods are too small for successful common envelope ejection .",
    "a merger results in a very exotic object , which may be a precursor to gamma ray burster or other strange supernova .",
