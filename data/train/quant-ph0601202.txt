    "the coherence properties of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have attracted considerable theoretical and experimental interest since the first experimental realisation of becs in trapped ultracold clouds of alkali atoms @xcite .",
    "part of this interest is due to the importance of coherence effects for the conceptual understanding of becs and their use as a source of coherent matter waves . in particular , the absence of spatial coherence in low dimensional becs , which exhibit strong spatial and temporal phase fluctuations , has been investigated theoretically @xcite and demonstrated for one dimensional condensates @xcite . moreover , temporal first and second order phase coherence of an atom laser beam extracted from a bec has been observed @xcite . however , to our knowledge , temporal phase fluctuations in a bec have not yet been measured directly , despite the fact that they ultimately limit the coherence time of an atom laser beam .    in this paper , we propose a scheme to measure temporal phase fluctuations of the bec based on a single trapped impurity atom coupled to the bec , hereafter called an _ atomic quantum dot _ ( aqd ) @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we consider an aqd with two internal states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where we assume for simplicity that only state @xmath1 undergoes collisional ( s - wave scattering ) interactions with the bec .",
    "this setup could be implemented using spin - dependent optical potentials @xcite , where the impurity atom , trapped separately @xcite , and the bec atoms correspond to different internal atomic states .",
    "the collisional properties of the aqd can , to a good approximation , be engineered by means of optical feshbach resonances @xcite , which allow to change the atomic scattering length _ locally _ over a wide range and are available even when no magnetic feshbach resonance exists .    by identifying the combined system of the aqd and the bec with an exactly solvable _ independent boson model _",
    "@xcite , we show that the dephasing of the internal states due to the asymmetric interaction with the bec is directly related to the temporal phase fluctuations .",
    "this dephasing can be detected under reasonable experimental conditions , for example , in a ramsey type experiment @xcite , and hence it is possible to use the aqd to probe bec phase fluctuations .",
    "since the phase fluctuations depend strongly on the temperature and the density of states of the bec , determined by the trapping geometry , the proposed scheme allows us to measure the bec temperature and to observe the crossover between different effective bec dimensions , notably transitions from 3d to lower dimensions .",
    "our scheme is nondestructive and hence it is possible , in principle , to investigate the dependence of phase fluctuations on the bec dimension and temperature for a single copy of a bec .    probing a bec with an aqd",
    "was proposed recently in @xcite and in a different context in @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite two states corresponding to the presence of a single atom in the trap or its absence were considered , as opposed to internal atom states .",
    "more importantly , in addition to the collisional interactions the impurity atom was coupled to the bec via a raman transition , allowing the realisation of an independent boson model with _",
    "tunable _ coupling .",
    "in particular , recati @xcite proposed to measure the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath2 by observing the dynamics of the independent boson model for different coupling strengths .",
    "other schemes based on interactions between impurity atoms and becs have been proposed recently . in @xcite , for example , an impurity was used to implement a single atom transistor , whereas in @xcite a quantum gate exploiting phonon - mediated interactions between two impurities was investigated .",
    "single atom cooling in a bec was considered in @xcite where some aspects of dephasing of a two state system ( qubit ) due to bec fluctuations were addressed .",
    "whereas their treatment focused on a three - dimensional bec and was based on a master equation approach , in our work we use an analytical approach similar to dephasing calculations for semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce our model for the aqd coupled to the bec and identify it with an exactly solvable independent boson model , which enables us to establish a relation between the temporal phase fluctuations of the bec and the dephasing of the aqd .",
    "we first consider an effective @xmath3-dimensional bec , which is strongly confined in @xmath4 directions and , as an ideal case , assumed to be homogeneous along the loosely confined directions .",
    "later we discuss corrections to this zero potential approximation due to a shallow trap potential . in section 3",
    "we show by means of a concrete example how dephasing depends on the interaction time @xmath5 between the aqd and the bec , the condensate temperature @xmath6 and the effective condensate dimension @xmath3 .",
    "section 4 addresses corrections to our results due to an imperfect measurement of the aqd state .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "we consider the system of an aqd coupled to a bec in thermal equilibrium with temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the bec is confined in a harmonic trapping potential @xmath7 with @xmath8 the position vector and @xmath9 the mass of the condensate atoms .",
    "the trap frequencies @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 assume the value(s ) @xmath13 or @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the trap frequency in the strongly confined ( transverse ) direction(s ) and @xmath14 the trap frequency in the loosely confined direction(s ) .",
    "depending on the number of strongly confined directions ",
    "none , one or two  the bec is either 3d or assumes effective 2d or 1d character , provided that thermal excitations are suppressed , i.e. @xmath16 , and that the interaction energy of the weakly interacting bec does not exceed the transverse energy , i.e. @xmath17 , with @xmath18 boltzmann s constant and @xmath19 the speed of sound . in directions that are loosly confined the extension of the trap potential is assumed to be much larger than the length scale @xmath20 set by the aqd size , so that it is justified to approximate the potential by zero , as discussed at the end of this section .",
    "we consider the case where the spectrum of the bec excitations , as compared to the impurity spectrum , is practically continuous .",
    "the aqd consists of an impurity atom in the ground state of a harmonic trap potential centered at @xmath21 and is described by the wave function @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 takes the form of the bec density profile in the strongly confined direction(s ) and has ground state size @xmath20 in the loosely confined direction(s ) .",
    "for example in case of a 1d condensate @xmath23\\,,\\ ] ] with the harmonic oscillator length @xmath24 .",
    "we further assume that the impurity atom has two internal states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and undergoes s - wave scattering interactions with the bec atoms only in state @xmath1 .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 , with level splitting @xmath27 , is the hamiltonian for the aqd , @xmath28 is the hamiltonian for the bec , and @xmath29 describes the interaction between the aqd and the bec .",
    "provided that @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the average interparticle distance in the bec , we can represent the @xmath3-dimensional ( quasi)condensate in terms of the phase operator @xmath32 and number density operator @xmath33 . here",

    "we shall see that the use of this model is fully justified , even though it exhibits only bogoliubov excitations with a linear dispersion relation @xmath39 , henceforth called phonons .",

    "@xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath29 acts on the relative phase of the two internal states , but does not change their population .",
    "this effect is customarily called pure dephasing .    the total hamiltonian can be identified with an independent boson model , which is known to have an exact analytic solution @xcite . inserting the explicit expression for @xmath35 into equation we can rewrite the total hamiltonian as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mean field shift .",

    "this problem is identical with the problem of a charged harmonic oscillator in a uniform electric field and can be solved by shifting each phonon mode to its new equilibrium position @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the aqd does not change the phonon frequencies and hence the phase fluctuations are the same in the presence of the aqd as in its absence .",
    "the state of the system is described by the density matrix @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that the aqd is in state @xmath0 for @xmath57 and in a superposition of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at @xmath58 , which can be achieved , for example , by applying a short laser pulse .",

    "the reduced density matrix of the aqd can be determined from the relation @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the trace over the bec .",
    "the coherence properties of the aqd are governed by the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath67 with the dephasing function @xmath68\\bigg\\rangle\\,,\\ ] ] where angular brackets denote the expectation value with respect to the thermal distribution @xmath61 .",
    "the dephasing function @xmath69 can be expressed in terms of the phase operator in the interaction picture @xmath70{\\hat{\\phi}}{({\\textbf{x}})}\\exp[-\\rmi h_{b } t/\\hbar]$ ] .",
    "we introduce the coarse - grained phase operator averaged over the aqd size @xmath20 @xmath71 and the phase difference @xmath72 to rewrite the phase coherence as @xmath73\\big\\rangle\\\\\\label{even }        & = \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\big(\\frac{\\kappa}{g}\\big)^2\\,\\big\\langle(\\delta{\\hat{\\phi}_{\\sigma}})^2{({\\textbf{x}}_0,t)}\\big\\rangle\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second equality can be proven by direct expansion of the exponentials @xcite .",
    "thus we have established a direct relation between the dephasing of the aqd and the temporal phase fluctuations of the bec averaged over the aqd size @xmath20 . moreover , the phase coherence is closely related to the correlation function @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the bosonic field operator describing the bec in the heisenberg representation . in the long - wave approximation , where the density fluctuations are highly suppressed , we have @xcite @xmath76\\,.\\ ] ] therefore expression can be interpreted as a smoothed out temporal correlation function of the bec field operator @xmath75 provided that @xmath77 .    to further investigate the effect of the bec phase fluctuations on the aqd we require an explicit expression for the dephasing function @xmath69 depending on the parameters of our system . for this purpose",
    "we express the dephasing function @xmath69 in terms of the coupling coefficients @xmath53 @xcite @xmath78 and take the thermodynamic limit of @xmath69 , which amounts to the replacement @xmath79 , with the density of states @xmath80 , @xmath81 $ ] and @xmath82 the gamma function . substituting expression for @xmath53 we find @xmath83 the integral is well defined due to the factor @xmath84 $ ] , which provides a natural upper cut - off . since for typical experimental parameters @xmath85 , with @xmath86 the healing length , the condition @xmath30 implies that @xmath87 .",
    "thus the upper cut - off at @xmath88 is still in the phonon regime , which justifies the use of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we now give the conditions under which the effects of a shallow trap on result are negligible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this limit is taken such that @xmath89 , with @xmath90 the radius of the bec , to ensure that the bec density at the center of the trap remains finite . to determine the trap - induced corrections to the density of states and the phonon wave functions , which affect @xmath91 defined by",
    ", we use a semi - classical approach based on the classical hamiltonian @xcite @xmath92 with @xmath93 the position dependent speed of sound , @xmath94 the phonon momentum and @xmath95 the shallow trap potential .",
    "the range of phonon energies @xmath96 relevant for the aqd dephasing is @xmath97 , where the lower bound goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit .    given the semi - classical phonon wave functions , we find that corrections to @xmath91 are negligible if @xmath98 , with @xmath99 the classical harmonic oscillator amplitude . for the density of states",
    "@xmath100 we use the semi - classical expression @xmath101 to obtain @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "thus in the regime where @xmath103 and after the substitutions @xmath104 and @xmath105 we have @xmath106 which up to numerical constants is identical to expression . the conditions on @xmath107 , together with the bounds of the phonon spectrum , imply that the dephasing in a shallow trap does not differ from the homogeneous case if @xmath108 , with @xmath109 the harmonic oscillator length .",
    "in this section we discuss by means of a concrete example how the aqd dephasing depends on the interaction time @xmath5 , the condensate temperature @xmath6 and the effective condensate dimension @xmath3 . to find the phase coherence @xmath110 we have evaluated the integral numerically ( shown in figures 1 , 2 and 3 ) and analytically in the high temperature regime @xmath111 .",
    "c    shows the phase coherence @xmath110 as function of the interaction time @xmath5 .",
    "the evolution of the phase coherence is split into two regimes separated by the typical dephasing time @xmath112s , which can be viewed as the time it takes a phonon to pass through the aqd .",
    "it follows from the analytic calculations that the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath110 for times @xmath113 is @xmath114&for $ d=1$\\\\     c_{t}^{\\prime}\\big(\\frac{\\sigma}{c\\tau}\\big)^\\nu&for $ d=2$\\\\      \\exp\\left[-\\big(\\frac{\\kappa}{g}\\big)^2\\frac{m\\,k_{b}t}{(2\\pi)^{3/2}\\hbar^2 n_0\\sigma}\\right]&for $ d=3$}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 are temperature dependent constants .",
    "thus the phase coherence tends asymptotically to a non - zero value in 3d , falls off as a power law in 2d and shows exponential decay in 1d .",
    "this result reflects the fact that the physics of 1d and 2d condensates differs significantly from that of a 3d condensate .",
    "given the relation between the phase coherence and the bec correlations , discussed in section 2.1 , we note that the results for the phase coherence are consistent with findings for temporal and spatial coherence properties of the bec @xcite , where in the latter case the distance @xmath118 has to be identified with @xmath119",
    ".    in particular in 3d the dephasing of the aqd is incomplete under reasonable experimental conditions due to the suppressed influence of low frequency fluctuations , which has been noted in the context of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "however , the residual coherence of the aqd will eventually disappear due to processes as , for example , inelastic phonon scattering @xcite , which are not taken into account in our model .",
    "we also point out that , in contrast to the remnant coherence of the aqd , the typical dephasing time does not depend on the coupling constant @xmath48 .",
    "c    the fact that phase fluctuations depend strongly on the density of states , or equivalently the dimension of the bec , allows us to observe the crossover between different effective dimensions , especially transitions from 3d to lower dimensions .",
    "shows the phase coherence @xmath110 as a function of the dimension @xmath3 for the interaction times @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 . the phase coherence @xmath110 drops significantly as the bec excitations in the strongly confined direction(s ) are frozen out .",
    "therefore we expect that the change of phase fluctuations depending on the effective dimension should be experimentally observable .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in addition , the aqd can be used to measure the bec temperature since the dephasing function @xmath123 is approximately proportional to the temperature @xmath6 according to equation .",
    "shows the relation between the phase coherence @xmath110 and the bec temperature @xmath6 in all three dimensions for the interaction times @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 . in 1d and 2d",
    "the interaction time @xmath5 can be chosen to assure that the aqd dephasing changes significantly with temperature , whereas in 3d the interaction time @xmath5 has little influence on the thermal sensitivity of the aqd .    in the high temperature regime",
    "@xmath124 the phase coherence is reduced mainly due to thermal phonons . however , even at zero temperature coherence is lost due to purely quantum fluctuations .",
    "this loss of coherence takes place on the same time scale as in the high temperature regime , but is incomplete in both 3d and 2d , which can be seen by evaluating the integral in the limit @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "the aqd dephasing can be detected in a ramsey type experiment @xcite : the aqd is prepared in state @xmath0 and hence initially decoupled from the bec .",
    "a first @xmath127-pulse at @xmath58 changes the state to a superposition @xmath128 and a spin - echo - type @xmath129-pulse at @xmath130 neutralizes the mean field shift . after a second @xmath127-pulse at @xmath131",
    "the aqd is found in state @xmath1 with probability @xmath132    however , this result is altered by decay of state @xmath1 into state @xmath0 , atom loss , imperfect ( noisy ) detection of state @xmath1 , and additional dephasing due to environmental noise .",
    "we subsume these processes into three phenomenological constants , namely the detection probability @xmath133 , the probability of a spurious detection @xmath134 , and the dephasing rate @xmath135 , which can all be determined experimentally .",
    "taking these effects into account we find an effective probability @xmath136 to detect state @xmath1 @xmath137 and the visibility @xmath138 in the limit @xmath139 is given by @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 correspond respectively to @xmath143 in the case of complete dephasing and no dephasing due to phase fluctuations .",
    "kuhr @xcite recently demonstrated state - selective preparation and detection of the atomic hyperfine state for single cesium atoms stored in a red - detuned dipole trap .",
    "they showed that dephasing times of 146ms and ratios @xmath144 of the order of @xmath145 are achievable .",
    "if we choose @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 we find a visibility of @xmath149 , which shows that our scheme is feasible even in the presence of additional dephasing due to environmental noise .",
    "we have shown that the dephasing of the internal states of an aqd coupled to a bec is directly related to the temporal phase fluctuations of the bec . based on this relation",
    "we have suggested a scheme to probe bec phase fluctuations nondestructively via measurements of the aqd coherences , for example , in a ramsey type experiment .",
    "it was shown that the scheme works for a bec with reasonable experimental parameters even in the presence of additional dephasing due to environmental noise .",
    "in particular , the scheme allows us to trace the dependence of the phase fluctuations on the trapping geometry of the bec and to measure the bec temperature .",
    "our scheme is applicable even if the bec is trapped in not strongly confined directions provided that the trapping potential is sufficiently shallow .",
    "we expect that the observed dephasing will be qualitatively different from our results only if the aqd size @xmath20 is comparable to the classical harmonic oscillator amplitude @xmath150 .",
    "in addition , our findings indicate that the use of aqds for quantum information processing , proposed recently in @xcite , may be constrained because of the unfavorable coherence properties of low dimensional becs .",
    "the results in @xcite suggest a natural extension of our work to entangled states between several aqds , which might lead to a probe with higher sensitivity",
    ". however , the experimental requirements for the state - selective preparation and detection of entangled states are considerably higher than for a single aqd , which has to be considered in the analysis of an extended scheme .",
