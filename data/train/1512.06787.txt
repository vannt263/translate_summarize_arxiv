    "a great success of lhc run  1 is the discovery of the 125  gev higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) . with a higher collision energy of 13  tev ,",
    "lhc run  2 is ideal for probing heavy exotic particles in new physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "recently , the cms and atlas collaborations have reported their results based on run  2 data with an integrated luminosity of @xmath0  @xcite . as the majority of run 2 searches have not detected exotic signatures ,",
    "their results have been used to set limits on bsm models , most of which are stronger than those from run  1 searches .",
    "some anomalies found in run  1 , such as the @xmath1 diboson excess , have not yet been confirmed by the latest run  2 searches  @xcite .",
    "however , some surprising results have been provided from diphoton resonance searches .",
    "based on a data set of @xmath2 , the atlas collaboration found an excess in the diphoton invariant mass distribution around 750  gev , with a local ( global ) significance of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "a fit to data suggested that this excess could be due to a resonance with a width of about 45  gev .",
    "a similar excess at @xmath5 has also been reported by the cms collaboration based on @xmath6 data , with a lower local ( global ) significance of 2.6@xmath7 ( 1.2@xmath7 )  @xcite .",
    "both collaborations claimed that this excess was not excluded by run  1 data , because of the large uncertainties in this energy range .",
    "this excess may be just due to statistical fluctuation , as many other disappeared anomalies in high energy physics experiments .",
    "future lhc searches with more data are required to confirm its existence .",
    "undoubtedly , if it is true , it would become the beginning of an epoch of bsm physics . according to the landau - yang theorem  @xcite ,",
    "a particle decaying into two photons can not be of spin-1 , implying that this 750  gev resonance should be either a spin-0 or spin-2 particle .",
    "spin-2 tensor fields can be realized in bsm physics related to gravity .",
    "for instance , this particle may be an excitation of the graviton in the randall - sundrum model .",
    "however , this kind of interpretations suffer stringent constraints  @xcite .",
    "many studies on the diphoton excess assuming a scalar or pseudoscalar resonance have appeared soon after the reports  @xcite .",
    "this resonance , which is denoted as @xmath8 hereafter , can be realized as an axion or composite higgs boson in models with new strong dynamics , as well as an exotic higgs boson with weak coupling .",
    "the cross section of the @xmath9 signal is of @xmath10 . in general ,",
    "higgs - photon couplings induced by top and @xmath11 loops are suppressed .",
    "therefore , heavy higgs bosons in ordinary two higgs doublet models ( including higgs bosons in the mssm ) could not account for this excess with such a large production rate  @xcite .",
    "thus the excess may suggest the existence of new charged and colored particles coupled to @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the broad width of @xmath12 suggested by the atlas analysis is also a challenge for model building . on the other hand",
    ", the cms fit seems to favor a narrower width , but the signal significance is too low .",
    "nevertheless , current data with low statistics could not give a final conclusion .",
    "in this work , we attempt to provide an interpretation of the diphoton excess in the context of effective field theory .",
    "we find that in order to explain the diphoton production rate , large @xmath8 couplings to gluons and photons are required .",
    "considering the constraints from resonance searches of lhc run 1 , it is challenging to achieve a broad decay width , if only the visible decay final states , such as dijet , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , are taken into account .",
    "this implies that there may be some invisible decay channels .",
    "an appealing and interesting possibility is that @xmath8 can decay into dark matter ( dm ) particles , which compose @xmath16 of the universe energy but leave no energy deposit in the atlas and cms detectors .",
    "thus it is straightforward to assume a scenario where @xmath8 is a portal between dm and sm particles , i.e. , dm particles interact with sm particles through the @xmath17 scalar ( pseudoscalar ) particle .",
    "constraints on this scenario are investigated in this work .",
    "we consider the limits from the lhc monojet search  @xcite , the dm relic density measurement  @xcite , dm direct detection results from the lux experiment  @xcite , and indirect detection results from the fermi - lat  @xcite and hess  @xcite @xmath18-ray observations , and the ams-02 measurement of the ratio of cosmic - ray antiproton and proton fluxes  @xcite .",
    "the expected exclusion limit of xenon1 t  @xcite is also used to show the sensitivity of future direct detection experiments .",
    "we find that these dm experiments set strong constraints on the model parameter space , and that most of the parameter regions accounting for the diphoton signal have been excluded or can be explored .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : interpret ] , we provide an interpretation to the diphoton excess in the context of effective field theory and consider the constraints from lhc run  1 data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dm ] , the constraints from dm relic density and direct / indirect detection experiments on the model parameter space are discussed .",
    "finally we give a conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "as there is no measurement on the cp property of @xmath8 at this moment , @xmath8 can be either a cp - even scalar or cp - odd pseudoscalar . in principle , its production could be initiated by @xmath19 annihilation , @xmath20 fusion , and electroweak vector boson fusion .",
    "since lhc is a @xmath21 machine , @xmath20 fusion has higher luminosity than @xmath19 annihilation after considering parton distribution functions .",
    "@xmath8 production via @xmath20 fusion is most probably a loop process , like the sm higgs case , where the major contribution comes from the top quark loop . @xmath8",
    "decay into diphoton can be mediated by loops of charged fermions and @xmath11 bosons . however , lhc run 1 data have given constraints on its direct couplings to sm particles @xcite , such as @xmath22 at 95% cl for @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the contributions to @xmath24 from the top and @xmath11 loops are stringently constrained and unlikely to account for the diphoton excess with a cross section of @xmath25 . in order to increase the cross section , some extra vector - like charged fermions",
    "may be required to induce a large effective @xmath26 coupling  @xcite .",
    "if these new fermions are heavy enough , they can be integrated out and the loop processes become contact interactions .",
    "consequently , the interactions between @xmath8 and gauge bosons can be described by some dimension-5 effective operators .",
    "assuming cp conservation , the effective operators can be given by @xmath27 for a cp - even @xmath8 , and @xmath28 for a cp - odd @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are parameters describing the effective couplings between @xmath8 and sm gauge fields of the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 groups , respectively .",
    "@xmath35 is a cutoff energy scale set by uv theory , and will be taken as a typical value of @xmath36 for simplicity .    in order to respect sm gauge symmetry , the lagrangians and",
    "are expressed by gauge eigenstates . in terms of the physical fields @xmath37 ( photon ) and @xmath38 ,",
    "the effective interactions become @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we can see that the @xmath45 and @xmath46 couplings generally accompany the @xmath47 coupling .    under the narrow width approximation",
    ", the production cross section for @xmath48 can be estimated by  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the center - of - mass energy of the system and @xmath51 is the momentum of one of the initial particles . @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the polarization states of the initial particles .",
    "@xmath54 is the spin of the resonance .",
    "@xmath55 is the total decay width of the resonance . @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the partial widths for the resonance decaying into initial states and final states , respectively . for the process @xmath58 , the production cross section depends on a factor of @xmath59 .",
    "the partial widths of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are independent of the cp property of @xmath8 and given by @xmath62 as an illuminating case , we may set @xmath63 , i.e. , assume that the @xmath26 coupling only comes from the @xmath8 coupling to the @xmath32 gauge field .",
    "then the @xmath14 and @xmath64 partial widths can be estimated as @xmath65 compared with the 8  tev upper limits and , one can easily see that the diphoton excess signal would not be constrained by run  1 data in this case .",
    "the total decay width can be given by @xmath66 thus , for @xmath20 fusion production , @xmath67 is predominantly determined by a factor of @xmath68    as the diphoton production cross section through an @xmath69-channel @xmath8 is @xmath70 under the narrow width approximation , we can separate the cross section calculation into two parts , i.e. , 1-body production cross section and decay branching ratio . other channels can be dealt with in a similar way .",
    "we calculate the @xmath71 production cross section with the simulation code ` madgraph  5 `  @xcite , to which the effective lagrangian is added through ` feynrules `  @xcite . as @xmath13",
    "fusion production would be important when the @xmath26 coupling is much larger than the @xmath72 coupling @xcite , we include both @xmath20 fusion and @xmath13 fusion to compute the production cross section , using the parton distribution function set ` nnpdf2.3 ` with qed corrections  @xcite . in the rest of this section , we only consider the case of cp - even @xmath8 .",
    "the results for cp - odd @xmath8 are similar .",
    "we present the contours of @xmath73 at @xmath74 and @xmath55 for @xmath63 in the @xmath29-@xmath31 plane in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : crosecvisdec ] . for large @xmath31 ,",
    "the @xmath73 contours tend to be parallel with x - axis .",
    "this behavior can be easily understood from eq .  .",
    "for @xmath75 , @xmath13 fusion dominates , and @xmath73 is also independent of @xmath31 . it can be seen that a wide region in the parameter space can satisfy the desired values , @xmath76 .",
    "however , in order to simultaneously obtain @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath31 should be as large as @xmath79 , where the @xmath61 channel dominates in @xmath8 decays .",
    "8  tev lhc diphoton resonance searches give the constraints  @xcite @xmath80 and @xmath81 at 95% cl .",
    "they are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : crosecvisdec ] with magenta solid lines , where the lower ( upper ) one corresponds to @xmath82 .",
    "it seems that the @xmath13 fusion dominant interpretation is incompatible with lhc run  1 data .    in many uv models ,",
    "the interaction between @xmath8 and gauge bosons are induced through loop diagrams containing new charged and colored vector - like fermions .",
    "hence the effective couplings @xmath83 and @xmath31 can be approximately expressed as @xmath84 where the @xmath85 functions denote loop factors , @xmath86 is a typical fermion mass , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the flavor and color number of the new fermions .",
    "therefore , in order to have a large @xmath31 that is greater than @xmath89 , a very large @xmath87 is needed , which may not be reasonable .",
    "furthermore , a large @xmath31 coupling would induce a significant dijet resonance signal via @xmath90 , which could conflict with lhc run  1 data .",
    "the 8  tev dijet constraint is also plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : crosecvisdec ] , from which we can see that it excludes the possibility of simultaneously having @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath63 .    on the other hand , we can fixed @xmath91 and assume that the @xmath26 coupling solely comes from the @xmath8 coupling to the @xmath33 gauge field . the result is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : crosecvisdec ] .",
    "we find that the situation becomes worse , as the run  1 constraints from the @xmath92 , @xmath14 , and @xmath93 channels has already excluded the region for desired @xmath73 .     at @xmath74 as functions of @xmath94 for different values of @xmath29 or @xmath31 assuming @xmath63 and @xmath95 in the case of cp - even @xmath8 . here",

    "besides , a smaller @xmath29 requires a larger @xmath119 to give a broad total width , but it is easier to be excluded by the monojet search .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that a broad scalar resonance accounting for the diphoton excess should have a large branching ratio into invisible decay modes .",
    "an appealing assumption is that the invisible channel is into dm particles . in this scenario ,",

    "since the current statistics of the diphoton excess is quite low and could not allow a very precise measurement of @xmath55 , we adopt a wide range of @xmath130 , and would select some distinct points satisfying a broad resonance condition @xmath131 .",

    "thus we assume dm particles are produced via the standard thermal freeze - out mechanism .",

    ", we obtain the predicted dm relic density by numerically solving the boltzmann equation , as described in appendix  [ app : anni ] , and require the relic density satisfies a loose criterion of @xmath134 .    after imposing these conditions , we project the parameter points in the @xmath125-@xmath124 plane in fig .

    "[ fig : dmgxmx ] we can see that red circles favor large values of @xmath124 .",
    "this is because the broad resonance condition @xmath131 always requires a large invisible decay width , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : interpret ] .",
    "for instance , if the invisible decay width is 45 gev in model m1 , @xmath124 should be larger than @xmath136 .",
    "a correct relic density can be achieved by a canonical value of annihilation cross section @xmath137 , which requires moderate values of @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) . since @xmath140 would be constrained by the lhc bounds ,",
    "a large @xmath124 is helpful for achieving a canonical annihilation cross section .",
    "however , if the resonance width condition is relaxed , a smaller @xmath124 may also provide a correct relic density as a result of the resonant annihilation effect .",

    "the contribution from the annihilation process @xmath143 becomes important . in this region , a correct relic density requires a large @xmath124 to enhance this channel .",
    "since the @xmath144 decay is forbidden when @xmath145 , @xmath55 is quite narrow .",
    "this is the case for blue circles and green crosses in the heavy dm region .",
    "the distributions of parameter points in models  m1 and m2 are similar , due to their similar kinematics at the lhc . however , the distributions in models  s and v are very different .",
    "this is because model  v is not a uv - complete model .",
    "the @xmath144 decay width would be significantly increased by the longitudinal polarization of @xmath97 for light dm .",

    "@xmath31 is further constrained below @xmath185 due to the monojet search .",
    "just a few points with @xmath134 and @xmath179 in models m2 , s , and v evade the constraint from fermi line - spectrum search , which , however , can not constrain model m1 .",
    "note that if the stricter fermi limit based on the region r3 for a nfw profile with @xmath186 is adopted , there would be much less black circles .",
    "the recent 750 gev diphoton excess found in lhc run  2 data has stimulated great interests .",
    "if this signal is confirmed in future lhc searches , it will open a new era of new physics beyond the standard model . in this work we attempt to explain the data in the framework of effective field theory .",
    "we find that the spin-0 resonance at 750  gev with a broad width of @xmath187 requires quite large couplings to gluons and photons . imposing the constraints from the dijet , @xmath14 , @xmath64 , and @xmath15 resonance searches in lhc run  1 , we find that the resonance should have a significant branching ratio into an invisible decay mode , which has also been constrained by the monojet searches in run  1",
    ".    if the final states of the invisible decay mode are dm particles , the 750  gev scalar coupling to dm would also be constrained by dm detection experiments .",
    "thus we consider the requirement from dm relic density and the constraints from direct and indirect detection .",
    "we find that the fermi - lat line - spectrum gamma - ray searches provide strong constraints on the model parameter space . a large parameter region that can explain the diphoton excess has been excluded .",
    "the fermi - lat dwarf galaxy continuous spectrum gamma - ray observations and the ams-02 cosmic - ray measurement of the @xmath148 ratio can also constrain the parameter space , but their limits are weaker than those from the line - spectrum gamma - ray searches .",
    "direct detection experiments could constrain the scalar coupling to gluons and dm particles .",
    "the future xenon1 t experiment is expected to explore a large parameter region accounting for the diphoton excess .",
    "it is interesting to note that for majorana fermionic dm coupled to a cp - odd scalar resonance , the dm - nuclei elastic scattering cross section is momentum - suppressed and spin - dependent , and hence could not be constrained by direct detection experiments .",
    "however , such a scenario can be deeply explored in line - spectrum gamma - ray searches . in the case of majorana fermionic",
    "dm coupled to a cp - even scalar resonance , annihilation processes can not be observed due to velocity suppression , but dm - nuclei si scatterings could be probed in direct searches",
    ". therefore direct and indirect searches are complementary to each other .",
    "in summary , the lhc run  2 diphoton excess may reveal the tip of the new physics iceberg and may have close connection to dark matter in the universe .",
    "we note that the corresponding effective couplings of this resonance to sm gauge fields and dm may be quite large .",
    "it seems not trivial to explain such large couplings in a uv - complete model .",
    "it would be very interesting to further clarify the properties of the resonance and its potential coupling to dm particles by combining more upcoming lhc run  2 data , fermi - lat searches , ams-02 data , and xenon1 t searches .",

    "<S> the recent reported 750 gev diphoton excess at the 13 tev lhc is explained in the framework of effective field theory assuming the diphoton resonance is a scalar ( pseudoscalar ) particle . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the large production rate and the broad width of this resonance are hard to be simultaneously explained if only visible final states are considered </S>",
    "<S> . therefore an invisible decay channel to dark matter ( dm ) is strongly favored by the diphoton resonance with a broad width , given a large coupling of the new scalar to dm . </S>",
    "<S> we set constraints on the parameter space in this scenario using the results from lhc run 1 , dm relic density , and dm direct and indirect detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dm searches can exclude a large portion of the parameter regions accounting for the diphoton excess with a broad width . </S>"
