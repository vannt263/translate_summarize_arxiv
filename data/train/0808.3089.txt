    "sophus lie made a profound contribution to mathematics and physics in the late 19th century by developing a theory based on his observation that solutions to certain problems in mechanics must be invariant under rigid motions of space , and that the structure in symmetry groups can be exploited to solve differential equations  @xcite .",
    "although lie theory is a rare find in the undergraduate curriculum , one of its topics  the special orthogonal group @xmath0 of rotations of space  is impossible to miss in courses such as linear algebra , differential equations and quantum mechanics .",
    "in theory and in practical computations , mathematicians and physicists use @xmath1 unitary matrices as a replacement for @xmath2 real orthogonal matrices .",
    "how this is done , and more important , why this is natural , are main points of this article .",
    "the explanation rests on the _ hopf fibration_. our secondary aim is to reconcile the differences between math and physics conventions in the use of unitary matrices to represent rotations .",
    "this is accomplished by comparing different versions of the hopf fibration .",
    "the exposition presented here requires no special background beyond university level vector calculus , linear algebra , and an introduction to group theory .",
    "definitions for those few objects which may exceed this minimum background  projective space , higher dimensional spheres , commutative diagrams and quaternions  are given in the appendix .",
    "heinz hopf defined a mapping in his 1931 paper  @xcite that we now call the hopf fibration .",
    "it was a landmark discovery in the young subject of algebraic topology that has since been recognized in many guises in mathematics and physics with applications including magnetic monopoles , rigid body mechanics , and quantum information theory  @xcite .",
    "the heart of the hopf map is the canonical projection @xmath3 that sends the complex vector @xmath4 to its equivalence class @xmath5 $ ] in projective space .",
    "we interpret this as a map @xmath6 by identifying @xmath7 as the subset of norm 1 vectors in @xmath8 , and by identifying @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the latter identification is a two - step procedure .",
    "first identify @xmath9 with the extended complex plane @xmath11 .",
    "one way to do this is the map @xmath12 given by @xmath13 \\mapsto z_0/z_1 $ ] ( `` chart '' is for `` coordinate chart '' ) .",
    "second , identify @xmath14 with @xmath10 using some version of stereographic projection .",
    "we will use two stereographic projections , @xmath15 for @xmath16 , given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we put these maps together to form a template for the generic hopf map . here and in diagrams that follow ,",

    "one obtains variations by altering the identifications with @xmath7 on the left and with @xmath10 on the right , for example , by using alternative coordinate charts on @xmath9 and by choosing different basepoints for stereographic projection .",
    "these variations are motivated by the desire to adapt coordinates to fit particular interpretations .",
    "the projection  ( [ c2top1proj ] ) comes to life when we view it in terms of group action .",
    "in general , when a group @xmath21 acts on a set @xmath22 , we have a bijection and @xmath22 are manifolds , the bijection  ( [ gpactionbijection ] ) is a diffeomorphism  @xcite .",

    "the action on @xmath22 is transitive ( @xmath31 for all @xmath27 ) and the isotropy subgroup of every point is trivial , so we have the identification @xmath32 given by @xmath33 .",

    "we identify the quaternions @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath30 via @xmath44 and regard @xmath42 as a real vector space with canonical basis @xmath45 and also as a complex vector space with canonical basis @xmath46 .",

    "the group of unit quaternions acts naturally on the subspace of pure quaternions ( where we interpret the pure quaternions as @xmath47 , see  @xcite and  @xcite for details ) via @xmath62 given by @xmath63 , where @xmath48 is a pure quaternion , @xmath64 is a unit quaternion and @xmath65 is the conjugate of @xmath64 ( the conjugate of @xmath66 is @xmath67 and is what you get if you take the hermitian ( conjugate transpose ) of @xmath64 viewed as a matrix via  ( [ quatmatident ] ) ) .",
