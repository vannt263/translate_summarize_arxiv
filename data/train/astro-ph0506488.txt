    "dwarf galaxies are believed to represent the dominant population , by number , of the present day universe , and a major constituent of groups and clusters .",
    "studying their star formation and chemical enrichment histories is the key to understand the evolution of galaxies on cosmological time scales ( e.g. madau _ et al .",
    "local group galaxies are ideal laboratories to detailed studies of dwarf galaxy properties : we can resolve their individual stars and thus learn about their star formation histories ( sfh ) by exploring ages , metallicities , and the spatial distribution of the stellar populations they contain . the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd )",
    "is the best tool for retrieving the sfh of a stellar system .",
    "cmds reaching at least the brightest part of the rgb or much better , the oldest main - sequence ( ms ) turnoffs , display stars born throughout the life - time of a galaxy and are fossil records of its sfh . at 50 and 60 kpc ,",
    "our nearest irregular neighbours , the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) are an optimal workplace to carry out detailed sfh studies .",
    "thanks to their proximity to the galaxy , it is possible to obtain deep cmds well down the ms turnoff stars ( m@xmath3@xmath0 + 4 ) . in spite of the proximity and the intrinsec interest ,",
    "is remarcable that there are still important gaps in the knowledge of the mcs ( e.g. olszewski _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . maybe their huge projected size , and the considerably big number of stars to be analized explain the situation . regarding the field population of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , this galaxy lacks large area studies reaching faint limiting magnitudes , equivalent to those of gallart _ et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) and gallart _ et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "gardiner & hatzidimitriou ( 1992 ) were pioneers in relatively deep wide field studies in the smc for ages greater than 0.1 gyr .",
    "they covered the external region ( @xmath42@xmath1 from the center ) . from their cmds ( which reached the horizontal branch at r@xmath020 mag )",
    "the authors infered an average age of @xmath010 gyr and interpreted the existence of a red horizontal branch as an evidence of a 15 - 16 gyr population , comprising around 7% of the total mass .",
    "however this work is mainly limited by the fact that the cmds do not reach the old ms turnoffs .    dolphin _",
    "( 2001 ) presented a combination of hst and ground - based _",
    "v _ and _ i _ images of a smc field near ngc 121 . from their ground - based images of the field",
    ", they infered a peak of star formation between 5 and 8 gyr ago , with a medium age of 7.5 gyr , and that 14%@xmath55% of the stars were formed more than 11 gyr ago .",
    "however , because of the small field analized these results should not be considered as representative of the whole smc .",
    "more recently harris & zaritsky ( 2004 ) , presented the sfh and chemical enrichment history of an 4@xmath1@xmath64.@xmath15 area centered on the smc , based on _ ubvi _ photometry from the magellanic clouds photometric survey ( zaritsky _ et al .",
    "they found that the smc formed @xmath050% of its total stellar population prior to 8.4 gyr ago , and that there was a quiescent epoch between 3 and 8.4 gyr ago , followed by more or less continuous star formation starting about 3 gyr ago and extending to the present .",
    "we present here twelve unprecedented deep _ br _ smc cmds ranging from @xmath01@xmath1 to @xmath04@xmath1 from the center of the smc and located at different position angles around the galaxy .",
    "these cmds clearly show the stellar population gradients in the smc .",
    "their depth , reaching the oldest ms turnoffs with very good photometric accuracy , will allow us to obtain detailed sfhs from all of them , and to investigate , therefore , the variation of the sfh accross the whole smc field .",
    "the observations were made at the 100-inch telescope at las campanas observatory . throughout our four years campaign ( 2001 - 2004 ) ,",
    "_ b_-band and _ r_-band images of 12 fields in the smc were obtained .",
    "each field cover 8.85@xmath7@xmath68.85@xmath7 with a scale of 0.259@xmath8/pixel .",
    "the fields were chosen to span a wide range of galactocentric distance , from @xmath01 to @xmath04 from the center of the cloud .",
    "_ figure  [ campo ] _ shows the spatial distribution of the fields ( hexagons ) .    in photometric nights , typically six _",
    "ubvri _ standard star areas from landolt ( 1992 ) were observed multiple times to determine the transformation of our instrumental magnitudes to the standard _",
    "br _ system .",
    "most of these areas include stars of a wide range of colors .    given the crowding in our smc fields , we performed profile - fitting photometry of the stars in them using the daophot",
    "ii / allstar / allframe programs , following the steps recommended by stetson ( stetson 1987 , stetson 1990 , stetson 1994 ) . daophot",
    "ii / allstar were used to create a master star list by combining , using daomaster ( stetson 1993 ) , the star list obtained for each individual image .",
    "then , allframe was used to perform simultaneous , consistent reductions of all ccd images of each smc field . for the final photometry , we selected stars with average @xmath9@xmath100.15 , chi@xmath101.8 and -0.3@xmath10sharp@xmath100.3 .",
    "we kept a total of 215121 stars , which have been measured in ( b - r ) down to _ r_@xmath1025 .",

    "_ 2004 ) have been superposed for three different metallicities appropiate for stellar populations in the smc ( z=0.001 , z=0.002 , y z=0.004 ) .",

    "_ 1998 ) extinction maps were used to obtain our smc fields reddening , except for the inner fields smc0057 ( at 1.09@xmath12 ) , qj0037 ( at 1.31@xmath12 ) , qj0036 ( at 1.33@xmath12 ) , and qj0111 ( at 1.35@xmath12 ) for which schlegel _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) estimated a typical reddening e@xmath13=0.037 , from the median dust emission in surrounding annuli . given that their quoted value is not accurate ,",
    "we have estimated a mean value of the reddening for each of the four smc fields mencioned above . in all cases ,",
    "relations a@xmath3=3.315e@xmath13 , a@xmath14=1.316a@xmath3 , and a@xmath15=0.758a@xmath3 were used .",
    "_ figure  [ cuatro1 ] _ shows smc fields qj0112 , qj0111 , qj0116 , and smc0057 corresponding to the eastern side , i.e. , facing the lmc , in order of increasing position angle , at distances from 1.09@xmath12 to 1.71@xmath12 .",
    "these diagrams show a prominent , conspicuous ms , which appears populated quite smoothly from the oldest turnoff at r@xmath022 to the 0.03 gyr isochrone .",
    "the four cmds present a substantial number of very young stars , which are well matched by isochrones as young as 0.03 and 0.01 gyr .",
    "this very young population may be a consequence of star formation triggered by a recent interaction with the lmc and the milky way , consistent with the yoshizawa & noguchi ( 2003 ) models .    _ figure  [ cuatro2 ] _ presents four cmds for fields to the western side of the smc , located up to a distance of @xmath02.9@xmath1 ; they are shown in order of increasing distance from the smc center .",
    "it is noticeable that these western fields show a much less populated young ms as compared with the eastern ones at similar galactocentric distances . in these fields , the intermediate - age population ( 1 gyr@xmath2age@xmath210 gyr )",
    "is the dominant one .",
    "fields qj0036 and qj0037 had star formation up to 0.1 gyr while the others two seem to lack stars younger than 1 gyr .",
    "four cmds of southern smc fields , located at distances ranging from @xmath02.2@xmath1 to @xmath04@xmath1 , are depicted in _",
    "figure  [ cuatro3 ] _ ; they are presented in order of increasing distance from the center and show a progresively less populated ms in their youngest parts as we go farther south .    a shared characteristic in all these cmds is the absense of a populated blue horizontal branch ( hb ) , which is consistent with the fact that the position of the @xmath013 gyr isochrone is not strongly populated .",
    "these results clearly show the existence of important stellar population gradients as a function not only of the distance to the center of the smc , but also , as a function of the position angle .",
    "thus , a complete description of the stellar populations and evolutive history of the smc requires further analysis involving spatially significant positions .",
