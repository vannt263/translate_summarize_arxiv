    "using the methods of theorem 3.4 and theorem 3.5 , we have not been able to to give bounds for @xmath3 which are nontrivial when @xmath238 .",

    "this has the potential to obtain sharper estimates for such polynomials and also to increase the range of values of @xmath240 for which an analogue of theorem 3.5 would apply .",
    "for example , bourgain , garaev , konyagin and shparlinski  @xcite consider the number @xmath241 of solutions to the congruence @xmath242 they show that if @xmath243 then we have the bound @xmath244 for some constant @xmath245 depending only on @xmath246 ( lemma 2.33 of @xcite ) .",

    "+ another possible way to improve on our results for certain classes of well - shaped sets is to use weyl s formula for tubes ( equation ( 2 ) of @xcite ) and steiner s formula for convex bodies ( equation ( 4.2.27 ) of @xcite ) to give an explicit constant in ( [ well - shaped ] ) for certain subsets of @xmath13^d$ ] for which these formula are valid .",
    "this would have the effect of improving on the bounds ( [ omega big ] ) and ( [ b bound ] ) and hence the bound for @xmath3 and possibly the range of values of @xmath240 for which this bound would be valid .",
