    "the observed apparent asymmetry of the ejecta in the acs / hrc image is suggested to be due to the effect of the finite width and offset from the [ o iii ] line s rest wavelength of the f502n filter .",

    "v2672 oph shows very similar characteristics to the rn u sco .",
    "it displayed a photometric plateau phase , a he / n spectrum classification , extreme expansion velocities and triple peaked emission line profiles during the decline phase @xcite .    using the meaburn spectrograph on the liverpool telescope @xcite we observed v2491 cyg from 2 to 31 days after outburst and with the asiago - afosc at 108 days after outburst . with the lack of resolved imaging to complement our spectra we first assumed some structures which have been previously observed in cne ( figure [ fig : v2491 ] ) .",
    "we modelled the h@xmath0 emission line at 25 days after outburst and then evolved our models to the later date ( day 108 ) .",

    "we found that two models produced similar results at 25 days after outburst ( polar blobs and equatorial ring and the dumbbell with an hour glass ) .",
    "however , when both models were evolved to day 108 we found that due to the contribution of [ n ii ] , which was not detected at the earlier date , the best - fit model was that for the polar blobs and an equatorial ring .",

    "similarly , we applied the techniques above to v2672 oph and found that the best fit model was for polar blobs and an equatorial ring with an underlying prolate structure whose density appears to decline faster with time than that of the other components .",
    "the inclination of the system is suggested to be 0@xmath26 degrees and a maximum expansion velocity of the polar blobs of 4800@xmath8 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
