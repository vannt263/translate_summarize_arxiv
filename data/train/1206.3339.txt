    "binary mixtures of bose - einstein condensates @xcite are of great interest due to their complex dynamical features and their role in the emergence of macroscopic quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "mixtures are experimentally available and usually made up of two alkali atomic species @xcite .",
    "they generally display repulsive self - interaction and are confined by various external potentials .",
    "depending on the inter - species interaction , two classes of stable configurations are possible : mixed and separated .",
    "the latter are more interesting , since it is in this case that the observation of phenomena such as symmetry breaking and macroscopic quantum tunnelling of one species through the other one @xcite is possible .",
    "evidence of phase separation has been observed in @xcite .",
    "many recent articles are devoted to the investigation of dynamical effects in mixtures , such as vortices and solitons ( see @xcite for recent experimental and theoretical studies ) .",
    "different approaches are possible in order to study the ground state of these systems . if the number of particles in the condensate is very large compared to the number of particles in the excited states , the fields associated to the two species can be treated as classical wave functions .",
    "this approach leads to the gross - pitaevskij equations @xcite , which are nonlinear schrdinger equations obtained by finding stationary points of the zero - temperature grand - canonical energy of the system .",
    "the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , which consists in this case in neglecting the kinetic energy of the system , is then usually applied @xcite .",
    "a great deal of results are obtained in particular cases , such as confinement by a hard wall trap @xcite , harmonic or lattice potentials @xcite and axisymmetric traps @xcite , also in the presence of the gravitational force @xcite .",
    "the problem of the stability of mixtures has been tackled also with renormalization group techniques @xcite .",
    "the presence of the kinetic term in the energy functional of a binary mixtures leads in particular to the regularization of possible domain walls , which sharply separate the two species in the tf ground states @xcite .",
    "this is generally related to the problem of minimizing the surface energy , that is also found in the theory of superconductivity @xcite .    in this work",
    "we introduce a variational method in order to approximate the gross - pitaevskij solution in a neighborhood of a domain wall and estimate the total energy of a mixture .",
    "our technique explicitly takes into account the normalization of the condensate wave functions and ensures complete analytical feasibility .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : bm ] we summarize results obtained in the tf approximation which are relevant to our analysis ; in section [ sec : reg ] we introduce the regularization technique and obtain results regarding the energy increase with respect to the tf approximation ; in section [ sec : dw ] we examine a case study in which macroscopic effects related to domain wall suppression can be observed and present a quantitative phase diagram ; in section [ sec : conc ] we suggest further possible developments of our technique .",
    "let us consider a binary mixture of bose - einstein condensates , confined by the external potentials @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the particles are tightly confined in the transverse directions , so that the system is quasi one - dimensional @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be the parameters that determine the self interaction between particles of each species and @xmath4 the inter - species interaction parameter .",
    "the ground state of the system is determined by the coupled gross - pitaevskij equations @xcite @xmath5 with @xmath2 .",
    "they are the variational equations of the quartic energy functional @xmath6 under the constraints @xmath7 where @xmath8 here @xmath9 are the condensate wave functions , whose squared moduli @xmath10 represent the local densities of each species , @xmath11 are the numbers of particles making up the condensates , while @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the kinetic , potential and interaction energy , respectively .",
    "we will assume henceforth that the condensate wave functions are real , since energy minimization requires their phases to be constant .",
    "the tf approximation @xcite is in this case equivalent to neglecting the kinetic terms in ( [ gpeq])-([engcpsi ] ) , so that @xmath15 the value of the adimensional parameter @xmath16 is crucial in qualitatively determining the tf ground state . if @xmath17 , which is the case of interest here , the ground state density profiles are completely separated in adjacent regions divided by domain walls . in the regions where only species @xmath18 is present , the solution to the tf equations reads @xmath19 equation  ( [ tf ] ) completely determines the functional dependence of the densities on the external potential ( and on the chemical potentials ) , once their supports are given .",
    "here we are interested in the ground state solution , so that the supports are determined by minimizing the energy of the system  ( [ engcpsi ] ) as a function of the number and the positions of the domain walls . in ref .",
    "@xcite we proved that for continuous trapping potentials stationarity of energy requires that the densities at a domain wall at @xmath20 satisfy @xmath21 moreover , in the special case @xmath22 , conditions ( [ rhowall ] ) imply that the external potential , and thus the density of each species , should be the same at all domain walls .",
    "the tf approximation works very well for large numbers of particles , and provides a good estimate of the energy of the system . despite being small with respect to the potential energy , corrections due to the kinetic term",
    "give nonetheless rise to macroscopic effects .",
    "the most relevant of such effects is the crossing between stationary states with different numbers of domain walls in the ground state @xcite .",
    "it is thus necessary , in order to determine the actual ground state of a mixture , to consider a regularization scheme of the tf density profiles , that enables to smooth parts of the tf profiles , like domain walls and zeros , that provide an infinite contribution to the kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "many attempts have been made so far in order to consistently estimate the energy corrections due to the kinetic contribution .",
    "the pioneering works by ao and chui @xcite and timmermans @xcite are based on an exponential approximation of the tf density profiles , by extrapolating the solution of the gross - pitaevskij equations far from a domain wall , and on a linear approximation of the regularized walls , respectively .",
    "other authors @xcite put forward a regularization with fixed chemical potential in various regimes .",
    "the task we will try to accomplish in this work is to find a proper domain wall regularization , which provides a reliable approximation to the ground state profile and energy of a binary mixture in a trapping potential , and which is at the same time an analytically manageable trial function .",
    "the approximations in @xcite are based on rather crude ansatz , but provide a good estimation of the order of magnitude of the energy changes due to the kinetic terms .",
    "however , we will try to find better upper bounds to the ground - state energies , since it is possible that a small energy change results in macroscopic differences in density profiles .",
    "our approximation will be referred to a system with fixed numbers of particles , and will strictly rely on the preservation of the normalization conditions .",
    "it is indeed difficult to use results obtained with fixed chemical potential @xcite in this case , since for non trivial external potentials it is generally impossible to invert the normalization conditions ( [ normal ] ) and explicitly express the chemical potentials as functions of the numbers of particles .      in order to regularize the domain walls",
    ", it is sufficient to replace the singular tf density profiles with a continuous function , with bounded first derivative .",
    "the minimization of the kinetic energy leads to tails of each species penetrating through the domain wall .",
    "our choice of trial profiles is based on an exponential tail regularization of the tf solutions .",
    "let us consider a domain wall placed at position @xmath23 . in its neighborhood",
    "we assume as profiles the continuous functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 the tf densities  ( [ tf ] ) .",

    "this assumption , which involves conditions on the ( by now arbitrary ) parameters @xmath34 , will be expressed at the end of our calculations in term of physical quantities .",
    "it is remarkable that under this approximation the regularized density profiles still satisfy condition ( [ rhowall ] ) at @xmath23 .",
    "once the trial profiles are chosen , we proceed to the computation of the difference in potential and interaction energy with respect to the tf densities .",

    "in a situation where small energy changes are involved , this discrepancy can be very relevant .",

    "the presence of first order zeros at the edges of the tf density profiles , which are compactly supported , gives rise to logarithmic divergencies in the kinetic energy .",
    "even this situation can be tackled by a proper regularization of the densities , leading to an increase in the potential energy and to a kinetic contribution @xcite . to this end",

    "hence one can obtain the scaling laws of the tf energy , @xmath104 , and of the kinetic energy , including the contribution ( [ ezero ] ) , @xmath105 .",
    "the energy of a domain wall depends on @xmath106 , and thus @xmath107 .",
    "the higher order corrections of @xmath108 terms accidentally scale like the kinetic energy .",
    "thus , in a configuration with @xmath79 domain walls , the trial ground state has energy @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the energy of the tf densities .",
    "as an application of the previous results we consider in this section the energy crossing between configurations with different numbers of domain walls in a double well potential . we will consider a physical situation in which a crossing between ground states with a maximal and a minimal number of domain walls can be observed .",
    "we introduce an operational way to control the crossing , based on a scaling property of the tf energy functional , thus suggesting a possible experimental realization .",
    "notice first that the effect of the kinetic energy on the ground state of a mixture in a square well potential is trivial , since in this case the tf energy for separated configurations depends only on the volumes occupied by the two species and not on how they are distributed inside the well .",
    "therefore , inclusion of the domain wall energy immediately enables us to identify the configuration with a single domain wall as the ground state .",
    "the situation is much more interesting for potentials that vary over the region occupied by the mixture . in the tf theory ,",
    "density profiles with a maximal number of domain walls are usually energetically favored , especially when the ratio of the self - interaction coefficients is very close to one @xcite .",
    "however , the inclusion of the kinetic energy can drastically change this picture .",
    "each domain wall has an energetic cost , expressed by ( [ ewall ] ) , whose effect on the total energy decreases as the numbers of particles increase .",
    "thus , for very large number of particles , the ground state is more likely to have a maximal number of domain walls , but if the number of particles decreases or the @xmath54 parameter increases , it can become more convenient to reduce the number of walls .    as a test ground for",
    "the effectiveness of our method , let us consider an example of this phenomenon , that was analyzed by numerical integration of the coupled gross - pitaevskii stationary equations in ref .",

    "the longitudinal trapping frequency was fixed to @xmath114 hz , with the transverse trapping frequency 30 times larger .",
    "the authors were able to build a phase diagram showing the crossing between single- and double - wall configurations by applying numerical techniques .",
    "an explicit comparison of the results for the total energies of the configurations are given in @xcite for @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    in table",
    "[ table ] we compare our results with those of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is manifest that , while for the symmetry - preserving ( double - wall ) state the two results are identical up to the fourth significant digit , our regularization method enables us to attain a stricter upper bound for the ground - state energy of the symmetry - breaking ( single - wall ) configuration . since the choice of the trial densities in the energy functional is based on the physics of the phenomenon , it is not surprising that our analytical regularization technique , together with the exact results coming from tf , leads to a better approximation of the ground state of a binary mixture than the accurate numerical integration of the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations @xcite .",

    "<S> this yields analytical results and provides the basis for further improvement of the approximation . as a case study </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a binary mixture of @xmath0rb atoms in two different hyperfine states in a double well potential and discuss the energy crossing between density profiles with different numbers of domain walls , as the number of particles and the inter - species interaction vary . </S>"
