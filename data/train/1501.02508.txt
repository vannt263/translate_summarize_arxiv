    "planet formation requires the hierarchical growth of dust grains to pebbles and thereafter to larger bodies eventually ending up at asteroids and comets - the planetesimals from which exoplanets form @xcite . at the same time , collisions between these planetesimals produce the dust grains we observe as the visible components of debris discs . since planetesimals are key to production of both planets and dusty debris , one might expect the properties of planets and debris around a star to be mutually dependent .",
    "this expectation has been strengthened by the direct imaging of several exoplanet systems around debris disc host stars and indirectly by the structural features observed in many debris discs ( warps , off - sets , asymmetries ) , which are often inferred to be due to the gravitational perturbation of the debris by one or more unseen exoplanet(s ) ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "observations of nearby sun - like stars at far - infrared wavelengths by the _ spitzer _ @xcite and _ herschel _ @xcite space telescopes revealed evidence for several correlations between planets and debris .",
    "_ herschel _ observations determined that a higher statistical incidence of exoplanets around debris disk host stars is seen , explicitly linking these two components of planetary systems @xcite .",
    "further correlations between the presence of both a debris disc and low - mass planets around low ( sub - solar ) metallicity stars @xcite , and between the presence of a debris disc and cold ( distant ) jovian planet(s ) @xcite , have also been identified .",
    "such correlations can be understood , and even expected , within a picture of planet formation via core accretion , and the subsequent dynamical interaction between planet(s ) and planetesimal belts .",
    "previous studies to determine the underlying connections between these distinct components of planetary systems  stars , planets and debris  have concentrated on analysis of target samples consisting of known exoplanet host stars with or without debris @xcite .",
    "little regard was given to the potential that any given star may in fact host a planet below the threshold of current detection capabilities .",
    "in this work we take account of the threshold upper limits for companions orbiting stars targeted by the anglo - australian planet search , some of which are already known to host planetary companions .",
    "the anglo - australian planet search ( aaps ) is an ongoing , 16-year high - precision radial - velocity survey of @xmath0250 nearby solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "it has achieved a consistent velocity precision of 2 - 3  for its lifetime , making the aaps a world leader in the detection of long - period planets analogous to jupiter .",

    "dust fractional luminosities , or upper limits in the case of non - detection at far - infrared wavelengths , of the aaps target stars were calculated from fitting of a modified blackbody @xcite to the _ spitzer _ mips measurements at 70  @xmath1 m ( compiled from * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and _ herschel _ pacs measurements at 70 and/or 100 and 160  @xmath1 m , along with optical , near- and mid - infrared and sub - mm measurements ( where available ) taken from the literature , following the approach of @xcite . in the case of targets with only upper limits on their emission at far - infrared wavelengths ,",

    "the stars considered here and the characteristics of the velocity data are given in table  [ rvdata ] .",
    "the detection limit was determined by adding a fictitious keplerian signal to the data , then attempting to recover it via a generalized lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite . here , we have assumed circular orbits ; for each combination of period @xmath2 and radial - velocity semiamplitude @xmath3 , we tried 30 values of orbital phase .",
    "the radial - velocity amplitude @xmath3 of the injected planet is increased until 99% of orbital configurations at a given @xmath2 are recovered with a false - alarm probability @xcite of less than 1% .",
    "this approach is virtually identical to that used in our previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because this approach uses a periodogram to determine detectability , gaps in data sampling can conspire to make some trial periods fail to produce a significant peak even for very large amplitudes ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these situations result in allegedly undetectable trial signals @xcite .",
    "we compensate for this artefact in the following way : if an injected signal at a trial period @xmath2 fails to be detected for all @xmath3 values , the algorithm switches from the periodogram to the @xmath5-test , starting again at @xmath6  and increasing @xmath3 until all trial configurations at that @xmath7 combination result in an rms which differs from the original data at the 99% significance level .",
    "the upper limits on planetary companions were computed in this way for all 141 stars .",
    "we choose the detection limit at 5au as a representative figure of merit , being the approximate orbital radius of jupiter , and being at an orbital period ( @xmath012 yr ) within the total timespan of the aaps data ( 16 yr)12 yr . the range in this sample is 0.45 - 1.72 , or @xmath8 16.9 - 8.5 yr , respectively ) ] .",
    "planetary detection limits in the sample of 141 stars are shown as a histogram in figure  [ planetlimits ] ; for comparison , known planets with @xmath9au and m  sin  @xmath100.2  are shown as a filled histogram . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , the aaps stars are presented as coloured or black data points , while those taken from literature sources are in greyscale .",
    "broadly speaking , two distinct regions dominate the parameter space illustrated in fig .  2 : systems with high fractional luminosities and no known planets ( of any given age ) occupy the top left ( with masses derived from sub - mm flux densities ) , whilst systems with low dust luminosities ( or only upper limits ) and massive jovian exoplanets occupy the bottom right .",
    "this is suggestive that massive , cool jovian planets preclude a peaceful coexistence with a debris belt @xcite .",

    "it should be noted that only the brightest ends of the distributions of both planet mass ( modulo orbital radius / instrument sensitivity ) and dust luminosity have heretofore been measured . that we are able to discern any correlation between these components of planetary systems , however tentatively , is perhaps unexpected @xcite .",

    ".      recent analysis of results from _ spitzer _ @xcite and _ herschel _ @xcite have identified correlations between the presence of debris and exoplanets around sun - like stars , finding that debris discs are more common around stars with known planetary companions @xcite and that low - mass planet hosts favour the presence of debris over those stars with jovian - mass companions @xcite . in this section",
    ", we apply the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) and fisher exact tests to the sample of aaps stars presented here , looking for similar correlations .",

    "the mass upper limits at 5  au for the stars are derived in this work . for the purposes of statistical analysis in this work , any star with a mass limit @xmath15 and no known jovian - mass companion is ruled to be a potential low - mass planet host star , whilst those stars with mass limits @xmath16 ( or host a known jovian - mass companion ) may potentially harbour a jupiter analogue planet and are therefore potential high - mass planet hosts in this analysis .    in the aaps sample",

    "43 stars host known substellar companions of which nine also host a cool debris disk . of the remainder",
    ", twelve stars are known to host a debris disk without exhibiting any evidence of planets , whilst the remaining 87 stars in the sample have no observational evidence of a companion planetary system .    _ stellar properties _ : comparing the stellar properties of the aaps sample with the volume limited radial - velocity planet hosts sample from @xcite using the fisher exact test , we find @xmath17-values in the range 0.5 to 1.0 for their effective temperatures , @xmath18 , ages and metallicities .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the stellar composition of the two samples are therefore similar , to be expected as they are both comprised of targets from radial velocity planet searches .",
    "however , a comparison of the distance distributions shows a marked dissimilarity , with a @xmath17-value of 0.057 as the aaps stars , by and large , lie beyond 20  pc .",
    "the dust upper - limits are a strong function of the stellar distance with only weak constraints on the presence of debris beyond 25  pc ( in the range @xmath19 to @xmath20 ) , but the @xmath17-value for dust incidence comparison of the aaps sample presented here with @xcite is 0.599 , so the two samples are indistinguishable regarding the presence of debris .    _ planetary mass ( limits ) _ : stars with sub - jovian mass limits are preferentially low ( sub - solar ) metallicity , suggesting that these stars do not have high mass planetary companions , as seen in @xcite .",
    "the significance of this correlation is low , as the low metallicity stars in the sample are older and closer than the average for the sample , such that bias plays a role there .",

    ", we obtain a @xmath17-value of 0.17 which is suggestive , but not conclusive , of a correlation between cool jupiter mass planets and debris .",
    "the strength ( weakness ) of the correlation is heavily influenced by the presence of hd  207129 , a large , bright debris disc host star @xcite , in the potential low - mass planet hosts subgroup .",
    "if we omit this star , then the @xmath17-value of the ks test drops to 0.05 , strengthening the significance of the ( potential ) correlation .",
    "we have analysed a sample of aaps stars , combining upper limits ( ruling out jovian analogues around several stars ) with radial velocity detections , and have been able to identify a weak trend of debris brightness with planet mass .",
    "further analysis , searching for other previously identified trends , is hampered by the weak upper limits on the presence of debris due to the larger distances to most of the stars in our sample than those of other samples , which typically concentrate on nearby stars ( @xmath21pc ) .",
    "the absence of any strong trends between planets and debris may be a function of the dynamical history of these systems wherein the chaotic dynamical evolution of planets ( including migration and scattering ) dominates the observed disc brightness .",
    "any correlations visible in more strictly defined stellar samples , wherein we have a better understanding of the relative incidences of their component parts as a function of the stellar and planetary properties is thereby diluted .",

    "<S> solid material in protoplanetary discs will suffer one of two fates after the epoch of planet formation ; either being bound up into planetary bodies , or remaining in smaller planetesimals to be ground into dust . </S>",
    "<S> these end states are identified through detection of sub - stellar companions by periodic radial velocity ( or transit ) variations of the star , and excess emission at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since the material that goes into producing the observable outcomes of planet formation is the same , we might expect these components to be related both to each other and their host star . </S>",
    "<S> heretofore , our knowledge of planetary systems around other stars has been strongly limited by instrumental sensitivity . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we combine observations at far - infrared wavelengths by _ iras _ , _ spitzer _ , and _ herschel _ with limits on planetary companions derived from non - detections in the 16-year anglo - australian planet search to clarify the architectures of these ( potential ) planetary systems and search for evidence of correlations between their constituent parts . </S>",
    "<S> we find no convincing evidence of such correlations , possibly owing to the dynamical history of the disk systems , or the greater distance of the planet - search targets . </S>",
    "<S> our results place robust limits on the presence of jupiter analogs which , in concert with the debris disk observations , provides insights on the small - body dynamics of these nearby systems . </S>"
