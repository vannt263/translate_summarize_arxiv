    "in addition to dna s fundamental role in genetics , it is now also a potential candidate for nano - electronic devices . the highly specific binding between single strands of dna and",
    "its self - assembly property open a whole new approach to single - molecule electronics .",
    "however , its intrinsic conductance properties remain highly controversial .",
    "as early as 1962 , eley and spivey suggested that @xmath3 interactions of stacked base pairs in double stranded dna could lead to conducting behavior@xcite .",
    "recently , there have been several experimental studies of the dna conductance , leading to a variety of results .",
    "these have ranged from wide - gap insulating behavior to proximity induced superconductivity .",
    "although double stranded dna has similarities to van der waals stacked aromatic conducting crystals ( _ e.g. _ the dna base pair spacing is similar to the preferred axis lattice spacing of aromatic crystals ) it also has essential differences from these and conventional conductors .",
    "unlike crystals , the dna is not a periodic system .",
    "the largest ionization potential difference between two isolated bases is about 0.6 ev between guanine and thymine which exceeds the estimated electronic coupling between base pairs .",
    "in addition , dna s environment , e.g. its dynamical interaction with water and counterions , can have a substantial impact on its conductivity . from molecular dynamics simulations ,",
    "the average displacement of a base pair in dna is about @xmath4 @xcite which is a tenth of the watson - crick spacing and an order of magnitude higher than in crystals at room temperature .",
    "all these properties make dna a highly dynamic system and it remains unclear how well traditional concepts from solid sate physics can describe it .",
    "dna has recently been the object of numerous single molecule studies to ascertain its conducting properties directly .",
    "results have varied dramatically , from finding a fully localized insulator@xcite , a wide gap semiconductor with coherent extended states@xcite , a metal at room temperature with ohmic current voltage characteristics and a conductance comparable to doped polyacetylene@xcite , and , most surprisingly , a proximity effect superconductor at very low temperatures@xcite .",
    "recently , self - assembled networks of dna have been developed with quite reasonable conductance properties over distance scales of 50 nm or less , and high conductance induced by chemical or gated doping@xcite ; these networks can be used to make transistor devices .",
    "indeed , a single molecule dna fet ( field - effect transistor ) has recently been constructed@xcite .",
    "motivated by these wide ranging experimental results on the conductivity of dna , we have embarked on a theoretical effort to ascertain what conditions might induce such remarkable behavior .",
    "our focus here is to examine whether any likely dna - structures or environments can yield reduced activation gaps to conduction or enhanced electronic overlaps . in particular",
    "ii ) , we have studied a hypothetical stretched ribbon structure , a , and b - form dna , and the effects of counterions ( especially sodium and magnesium ) with and without water .",
    "we have used a combination of fully ab initio density functional theory ( dft ) code ( siesta@xcite ) , and a parameterized hckel - slater - koster@xcite modeling using only atomic @xmath2 orbitals ( @xmath5 the long axis of the molecule ) of the bases .",
    "we have been unsuccessful in identifying structural motifs that might engender metallic conductance in dna , but we give an explanation why dna in the a - form provides less effective electronic coupling along the helical axis than b - dna .",
    "while direct matrix elements between two highest occupied molecular orbitals ( homos ) or lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( lumos ) for model a-(b-)dna are of order 0.01 ev ( 0.1 ev ) , individual matrix elements between @xmath2 orbitals on well contacted atoms in adjacent base pairs can generally exceed 1 ev .",
    "we also demonstrates the possibility of small activation gaps of order @xmath6 with a first principles study of 4 base pair long b - dna .",
    "we discuss the cases of sodium and magnesium counterions , with ( wet dna ) or without water ( dry dna ) .",
    "we have also studied the influence of longitudinal and torsional vibrations upon the electronic structure of dna ( sec .",
    "[ sec : level3 ] ) , and estimated reorganization energies , franck - condon factors , and charge transfer rates between adjacent bases ( sec.[sec : level4 ] ) .",
    "we find good agreement between our estimated rates and recent experimental data@xcite assuming that torsional ( twist ) vibrations limit the charge transfer most significantly .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : level5 ] .",
    "some of the mathematical details can be found in appendix [ sec : levela ] .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that the electronic coupling between base pairs is highly sensitive to the dna - structure and thus to the influence of its environment , which can modify the structure .    in biological situations ,",
    "there are several double helical conformations of dna depending on the humidity and salt concentration .",
    "we consider the a- and b - forms .",
    "the b - form predominantly occurs _ in vivo _ , has a unit cell of 10 base pairs ( neglecting sequence effects ) , a helical rise of about @xmath7 per base pair , and a twist angle between adjacent base pairs on average of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "since the base pairs are approximately perpendicular to the helical axis , the base pair separation is close to the helical rise .",
    "the a - form exists at low humidity in the presence of some salts .",
    "the double helix is relaxed to 11 base pairs in a unit cell exposing more of the hydrophobic core of base pairs and portions of the sugar units of the backbone .",
    "the helical rise and base pair separation are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the twist angle is only @xmath11@xcite .",
    "there are also other known conformations . in order to obtain straight dna molecules for conductivity measurements , one often uses a technique called molecular combing @xcite .",
    "when a dna molecule is anchored at one end on a hydrophobic surface like polystyrene , a receding meniscus can stretch dna by a factor of 1.7 , or if grafted at both ends to the surface even by a factor as large as 2.1 .",
    "the capillary forces are typically @xmath12 and can become as large as @xmath13 which results in breaking of the molecule . the stretching has been theoretically examined with molecular dynamics simulations using classical force fields @xcite .",
    "since the phosphate - phosphate distance along the backbone is about @xmath14 and the base pair separation in b - dna is about @xmath15 , stretching by a factor of 2 can , in principle , lead to a complete unwinding of the double helix .",
    "since just stretching would weaken the inter base pair electronic coupling , we examine the possibility of base pairs which lie in the plane of the backbone strands ( fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) . in this case , the base pairs can come close again and the kinetic energy of the @xmath16 electrons can in principle be lowered if there was decent @xmath1 overlap between the @xmath2 atomic orbitals at the closest contacts ( with the z - axis now perpendicular to the ribbon ) .",
    "ribbon - like structures are indeed found by k. m. kosikov _",
    "et al _ @xcite , e.g. the structures @xmath17 or @xmath18 , by using a classical force field .",
    "ideal 2-dimensional ribbon structure for dna stretched by a factor of 2 .",
    "the box indicates the unit cell of height @xmath19 .",
    "there are only very few good electronic contacts .",
    ", width=321 ]      in order to get a realistic picture of the electronic coupling strength between two base pairs , the smallest structural unit through which charge has to go , we use the dft code siesta @xcite .",
    "since its aim is efficiency and large systems , it uses troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudo potentials@xcite in the kleinman - bylander form@xcite , and a basis set of numerical atomic orbitals using the method by sankey and niklewski@xcite .",
    "we used a double-@xmath20 basis set with polarization orbitals ( dzp ) , the largest basis within siesta , and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation energy functional in the version by perdew , burke and ernzerhof@xcite .",
    "the structures for b and a - dna were obtained from x - ray diffraction data ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "since the hydrogen atoms were missing in the a - dna structural data , they were added and relaxed with the conjugate gradient method .",
    "the ideal 2-dimensional ribbon structure of figure [ fig : fig1 ] was created artificially in order to get most effective @xmath1 overlap and a small unit cell containing only a single base pair . as for the 2 base pair calculations , only methylated@xcite base pairs without the backbone were used for simplicity .",
    "consider two molecular orbitals ( mos ) , @xmath21 from base pair 1 , and @xmath22 from base pair 2 .",
    "@xmath23 are eigenstates from siesta for individual base pairs .",
    "they can be expanded in terms of the original atomic orbitals of siesta , e.g. @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the dimension of the base pair 1 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 the lcao ( linear combination of atomic orbitals ) coefficients and atomic orbital basis states , respectively .",
    "the electronic coupling @xmath28 between states @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be computed as follows using formulas for non - orthogonal states@xcite , _ viz _ @xmath29(1-s_{\\alpha\\beta}^2)^{-1}\\label{eq : t12}\\\\ t'_{\\gamma\\delta}&=&\\sum_{i=1}^{n_\\gamma}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_\\delta}c_i^\\gamma c_j^\\delta h_{ij}^{\\gamma\\delta},\\quad s_{\\alpha\\beta}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n_\\alpha}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_\\beta}c_i^\\alpha c_j^\\beta s_{ij}^{\\alpha\\beta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 can take the values @xmath21 or @xmath22 according to eq . [ eq : t12 ]",
    ". the total hamiltonian h ( overlap s ) matrix of the two base pair system with dimensions @xmath32 can be obtained from siesta",
    ". it can be thought of as consisting of two diagonal blocks @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) representing the intra - base pair couplings ( overlaps ) and one off - diagonal block @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) representing inter - base pair couplings ( overlaps ) .    the values for the electronic couplings @xmath28 between two homos , as well as two lumos , are shown in table [ tab : table1 ] . as for the b - form , they are in general small and in good agreement with earlier _ ab initio _ studies @xcite , but for a and ribbon form they are much smaller than for the b - form . for the ribbon structure ( including the backbone ) , we also carried out a band structure calculation after fully relaxing the geometry .",
    "the bands were calculated at 30 k points in the long direction using a brillouin zone sampling at 3 k points .",
    "there was no sign of dispersion in agreement with the weak electronic coupling .",
    "that is , once stretched the base pair states localize .",
    ".[tab : table1]transfer integrals in ev between homos ( @xmath39 ) and lumos ( @xmath40 ) of two base pairs .",
    "the calculations are done with siesta and dzp basis set .",
    "the expression dimer always stands for a two base pair long dna sequence , e.g. the gg dimer stands for 5-gg-3 dna . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     upper and lower bounds for the charge transfer rates between two base pairs are shown in table [ tab : table3 ] .",
    "for the upper bound , we take @xmath41 in equation ( [ eq : marcus ] ) to be the inner base pair nuclear frequency , while for a lower bound we take it to be the base pair twist frequency .",
    "this slow process can be viewed as reaching an encounter complex with a frequency @xmath42 .",
    "we note the large franck - condon factor in table [ tab : table3 ] for hole transfer between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( dimer ag ) .",
    "this is because this case is close to the so - called optimal electron transfer regime in which the reorganization energy ( @xmath45 ev ) is largely compensated by the reaction energy ( @xmath46 ev ) @xcite as estimated from analyzing electron transfer yield data .",
    "note that this reaction energy is smaller than the difference of the bare oxidation potentials ( @xmath47 ev ) between isolated adenine and guanine bases in a polar solvent @xcite , in gas phase @xcite , or from _ ab initio _ calculations and koopman s theorem@xcite .",
    "furthermore , hole transfer is in most cases at least one order of magnitude faster and hence more efficient than electron transfer .",
    "in order to compare with experiment we turn to ( hole ) transfer between initially excited 2-aminopurine ( an isomer of adenine ) and guanine @xcite .",
    "the measured charge injection time of 10ps ( corresponding to a rate of @xmath48 ) is surprisingly close to our lower bound value @xmath49 .",
    "hence we speculate that the twisting motion of base pairs is rate limiting .",
    "another simple application of the 2 base pair charge transfer rates of table [ tab : table3 ] is the hole hopping between homogeneous sequences , e.g. @xmath50 , when one assumes ( biased ) random walk as the underlying mechanism of the charge migration . in this case",
    ", the rate shows a weak algebraic distance dependence@xcite @xmath51 , where n is the number intervening base pairs and @xmath52 .",
    "absolute rates can be predicted with our ( lower bound ) value @xmath53 @xmath54 . in order to compare with experiment ,",
    "e.g. @xcite , one would have to include the initial transfer from the donor to the bridge , as well as the final transfer from the bridge to the acceptor which leads to a further reduction of the rate .",
    "general formulas are provided in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , since charge transfer between adjacent base pairs is likely to be adiabatic , one should avoid including these when fitting to a diabatic charge transfer rate @xmath55 . including the adjacent base pair charge transfer in the fit leads to an under - estimation of @xmath22 .",
    "in summary , we have studied the electronic properties of dna from several perspectives .",
    "our initial motivation was to come up with possible conditions which enhance the conductance of dna .",
    "for example , we expected a stretched ribbon - like dna to be a potential candidate for a molecular wire .",
    "unfortunately , that has not turned out to be the case . indeed , in the ribbon - like dna",
    ", the base pair separation can become quite small .",
    "however , the pp@xmath16 interaction appears not very effective as there are only very few good contacts . using the _ ab initio _ code siesta we compared transfer integrals between base pairs of a , b and stretched dna .",
    "our calculations suggest that a - dna and stretched , ribbon - like dna should support electrical current even less than b - dna .    on the other hand , a first principle study of 4 base pair long dna in the b - form with different counterions ( sodium , magnesium ) under dry and wet ( @xmath56 water molecules ) conditions shows the possibility of small activation gaps of order @xmath6 .",
    "although the @xmath16 - @xmath57 gap is several ev large , a small gap is formed mainly by water and counterion states in the case of wet dna , or by backbone and counterion states in the case of dry dna . in the latter case , the backbone states rise in energy and lie higher than the occupied @xmath16 mos due to repulsive interactions of the negatively charged backbone . since small activation gaps ( @xmath58 ) are found experimentally for bundles@xcite or supercoiled dna @xcite from a sodium buffer , this could be caused by residual water and condensed counterions providing an alternative pathway for charge hopping . to our knowledge , there is less experimental conductivity data available for dna from a magnesium buffer .",
    "the most prominent case is the observed induced superconductivity @xcite requiring truly extended metallic - like states . from our first principle studies of dna with ions and water , we do notice some differences between magnesium and sodium ions . for wet dna ,",
    "electron excitation from occupied water and magnesium states into empty @xmath57 states seems possible making electron conduction feasible .",
    "in addition , for dry dna with magnesium ions , the activation gap between occupied backbone and unoccupied magnesium states is vanishingly small .",
    "in addition , there is a large dos of phosphate states right below the fermi energy available .",
    "this pinning - effect opens the possibility of a pathway for hole hopping through the backbone .    in order to get a better microscopic understanding of the electronic coupling between adjacent base pairs and how it is affected by twisting and displacement motion",
    ", we developed a hckel - slater - koster model with parameters obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "we find that the transfer integral is constrained by a competition between pp@xmath59 and pp@xmath16 interaction and interference by phase factors of atomic @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "the latter effect also leads to sign changes in the transfer integrals as a function of the torsional angle not anticipated in previous studies .",
    "furthermore , the temperature dependence of the average transfer integral and band gap is expected to be weak : first , the electronic coupling is already weak anyway , and can not be reduced much .",
    "second , twisting and displacement motion of base pairs have cancelling contributions .",
    "next , we showed that charge transfer rates between adjacent base pairs are likely in the adiabatic limit .",
    "thus , if one uses ( modified ) bases as donor and acceptor in charge transfer experiments , it is important to take this into account .",
    "when obtaining the decay length @xmath22 of diabatic charge transfer from a fit to an experimental rate as a function of distance , the data point corresponding to the donor and acceptor next to each other should not be included in the fit .",
    "we also calculated franck - condon factors , reorganization energies and nuclear frequencies to obtain absolute rate estimates .",
    "furthermore , we suggest that the twisting motion might be rate limiting for hole transfer . due to the adiabaticity of the two base pair rates ,",
    "dna might be a good medium for diffusive charge transport .",

    "<S> motivated by the wide ranging experimental results on the conductivity of dna , we have investigated extraordinary configurations and chemical environments in which dna might become a true molecular wire , perticularly from enhanced electronic overlaps or from small activation energies . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we examine a- vs b - dna , the ribbon - like structures proposed to arise from molecular stretching , the potential role of counterions in hole doping the dna orbitals , the possibility of backbone conduction , and the effects of water . </S>",
    "<S> we find that small activation gaps observed in conductivity experiments may arise in the presence of water and counter ions . </S>",
    "<S> we further discuss the role of harmonic vibration and twisting motion on electron tight binding matrix elements using _ ab initio _ density functional theory and model koster - slater theory calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that partial cancellation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 interaction of @xmath2 orbitals on adjacent base pairs , along with destructive interference of phase factors are needed to explain the weak conductance of a - dna . </S>",
    "<S> our results lead also to a physical interpretation of the angular dependence of inter - base pair tight binding matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we estimate franck - condon factors , reorganization energies and nuclear frequencies essential for charge transfer rates , and find our estimated hole transfer rates between base pairs to be in excellent agreement with recent picosecond dynamics data . </S>"
