    "our understanding of the gaseous content of our galaxy has advanced greatly in recent years as instruments sensitive to a variety of wavebands have become available .",
    "one component of the galaxy s gaseous neighborhood remains poorly understood : the ensemble of high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) .",
    "initially discovered in @xcite by @xcite , hvcs are clouds of  gas that deviate in velocity from the differentially rotating disk of gas by 70300 .",
    "these structures have been studied extensively in  emission , emission , and absorption against background point sources , with several published catalogs detailing their observed characteristics @xcite .",
    "a cursory inspection of the hvc catalogs reveals a tremendous variation in size , morphology , and velocity ; this variation has led to a number of formation scenarios that predict different physical properties .",
    "one favored model is the galactic fountain , a cyclic phenomenon whereby hot ( @xmath0 k ) gas is ejected into the lower halo ( @xmath1 kpc ) by supernova explosions @xcite . here",
    "the gas cools and loses its buoyancy , free - falling back to the disk in sheets at mainly negative velocities approaching 100 .",
    "a second scenario suggests accretion of close companion galaxies , either through tidal or ram - pressure stripping as a companion moves through the hot , extended galactic halo .",
    "this is undoubtedly the origin of the magellanic stream @xcite , and there is recent evidence for gaseous remnants of satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "other scenarios propose alternate extragalactic origins , such as accreted intergalactic medium ( igm ) material @xcite or discrete remnants of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "this last model attributes the most compact hvcs ( chvcs ) to an ensemble of primordial , dark - matter - dominated `` minihalos '' streaming into the local group along filaments of moderate overdensity .",
    "such clouds would have a typical distance of @xmath2 750 kpc , and total mass of @xmath3@xmath4  per cloud ( assuming @xmath5 ) .",
    "modeling by @xcite and simulations of cdm halo evolution by @xcite and @xcite support a more local distribution of @xmath2 150 kpc .",
    "the clouds need not be dominated by dark matter , as uneven cdm halo cooling can result in fragmentation and produce a population of moderately - ionized , pressure - confined clouds embedded in a hot corona @xcite .    lrrrrr igm infall & @xmath6 & @xmath7 & @xmath8 & @xmath9 & 0.10.3 + galactic fountain & @xmath10 & @xmath7 & @xmath8 &  & @xmath11 1 + companion stripping & 5100 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 &  & 0.11 + circumgalactic warm clouds & @xmath14 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 & - & 0.10.3 + circumgalactic dm halos & @xmath14 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 & - & 0.10.3 + local group dm halos & @xmath15 & @xmath12 & 110 & & 0.10.3 +    one key discriminator between these production mechanisms is distance , yet this parameter is difficult to determine since hvcs contain no visible stars .",
    "the most direct method of searching for hvc absorption against background halo stars has met with limited success until very recently , yielding upper limits on the distances to five hvcs and eight intermediate - velocity clouds ( ivcs ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the upper bounds to the vertical @xmath16 heights of these hvcs range from 0.2 kpc to 7 kpc , and the corresponding mass limits range from about 1  for a very small hvc to 2  for complex a. recent work has placed stronger constraints on an additional four hvcs , placing them at distances of @xmath2 515 kpc @xcite . in particular , @xcite infer a distance of 3.711.2 kpc for complex c , suggesting an  mass of 314 .",
    "indirect methods have also been used to determine hvc distances , such as constraining the degree of ionization on the cloud surface .",
    "it is difficult to model the strength of the uv radiation field leaking out of the milky way , although there are indications that the field is sufficient to ionize at least the surfaces of an hvc @xcite .",
    "several groups have identified ionized `` skins '' in a number of hvcs @xcite , and observations by @xcite of  emission in 25 hvcs limit their distances to @xmath17 kpc .",
    "while recent progress has been made , large gaps remain in our understanding of galactic hvcs , the nature of the gaseous galactic halo , and the relationship between such a halo and the thin , star - forming disk .",
    "the various hvc production scenarios predict different consequences for galaxy formation and evolution . in table [",
    "tab : scenarios ] , we outline the predictions of the scenarios described above in terms of observables ( size , velocity ) and physical properties ( mass , metallicity ) .",
    "our vantage point remains an impediment to discriminating between these scenarios , as we are embedded within the very medium we attempt to disentangle .",
    "the superposition of material in position and velocity complicates the analysis , and chance locations of statistically anomalous sources ( such as the magellanic stream and large hvc complexes ) bias the conclusions .",
    "these problems are largely overcome by observing a large sample of external galaxies , constraining the fundamental properties of their diffuse halos , and extrapolating to the milky way . until recently ,",
    "extragalactic studies have concentrated on the structure of the kinematically cold disk , and the discovery of anomalous - velocity material has been serendipitous .",
    "early evidence of anomalous  appeared in the face - on galaxies m 101 @xcite , ngc 628 @xcite , and ngc 6946 @xcite , with detections of a few clouds of mass @xmath18 .",
    "integrated profiles from a sample of 14 face - on galaxies show evidence for high - velocity gas in 10 of the systems @xcite .",
    "more recent observations of inclined galaxies have uncovered anomalous  gas in every target imaged with sufficient depth .",
    "deep radio synthesis observations of ngc 891 @xcite , ngc 2403 @xcite , ngc 4559 @xcite , ngc 253 @xcite , and ngc 6946 @xcite have revealed vertically extended , slowly rotating `` thick '' disks of , suggestive of galactic fountain activity .",
    "modeling of a subset of these data confirm this conclusion , although some amount of igm infall is required to prevent escape of the fountain gas and to produce the gas kinematics that are observed @xcite .",
    "a gbt study of m 31 has uncovered for the first time a population of discrete hvc - like  clouds in an external galaxy @xcite .",
    "these objects are all within 50 kpc of the galaxy .",
    "surveys of galaxy groups have so far failed to detect hvc analogs without optical counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "extrapolation by @xcite of results from six local group analogs suggest the galactic hvcs all lie within 90 kpc of the galaxy .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the first results of a search for hvcs in nearby external spiral galaxies .",
    "we concentrate on face - on galaxies , since the line - of - sight velocity of the rotating  disk is minimized and the parameter space available for hvc searching is maximized .",
    "these targets provide a necessary complement to the numerous inclined spirals which have been recently observed , as detailed above . by combining the  data with deep optical surface photometry ,",
    "we can constrain the amount of starlight in any anomalous  clouds we find .",
    "the next section summarizes the observations and reduction of both the and broad - band optical data . in section 3 , we discuss features of the bulk  and optical disks . in section 4 , the cold  disk is modeled and subtracted , and extended anomalous  emission is analyzed .",
    "section 5 discusses the detection of discrete anomalous  emission , introducing a new detection algorithm ( further detailed in the appendix [ app : snrch ] ) and presenting simulations that constrain the effectiveness of this technique .",

    "while the optical , star - forming disk is small and well defined @xcite , the  disk is very extended , reaching to 6.5 times the optical holmberg radius with 80% of the total  mass found outside this radius @xcite .",
    "the  disk is resolved into distinct rings and arms in this region , exhibiting a high degree of warping @xcite .",
    "the basic properties of m 83 are presented in table [ tab : m83params ] .",
    "the radio data for m 83 were obtained in three separate observations with the vla on 24 and 28 february and 1 march 1999 . to match the beam size with the scale of the expected emitting regions ( 1 kpc = 46  at 4.5 mpc ) , we chose to observe in the dnc configuration , in which the northern arm of the array is in the more extended c configuration . for sources at southern declinations such as m 83 ( meridian altitude = 261 at the vla s latitude of @xmath30341 ) , this configuration produces a more symmetric @xmath31-plane coverage pattern and a synthesized beam of about 35fwhm ( 0.76 kpc at a distance of 4.5 mpc ) .",
    "each observing run consisted of a 5 min observation of the primary flux calibrator 3c 286 , with a scan integration time of 20 s. this was followed with a series of @xmath2 50 min exposures of m 83 with integration times of 60 s , intermixed with 5 min exposures of the secondary calibrator 3c 283 .",
    "the total time spent on source was 12.2 h.    the vla spectral line correlator was configured to observe in the 1420 mhz frequency band , or `` l - band '' .",
    "the correlator configuration and resulting data parameters are summarized in table [ tab : m83hiparams ] . to allow detection of  emission at highly anomalous velocities , we used the largest bandwidth offered by the correlator , 3.125 mhz .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity width of 660 , of which only the inner 540  were retained because of edge noise . with the bandwidth centered on the systemic velocity of m 83",
    ", this enabled detection of features deviating by @xmath32  from systemic .",
    "we expected the features to have linewidths of @xmath2  2030  fwhm , therefore a velocity resolution of 510  would have been sufficient for this project . to make the dataset generally usable to the community",
    ", we chose to observe at the full spectral resolution , with no on - line hanning smoothing applied , and using the single if correlator mode ( sensitive only to right - handed circular polarization ) .",
    "this resulted in 256 channels with a channel separation of 12.2 khz ( 2.58 ) and a channel width of 14.6 khz ( 3.10 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 calibrator data were edited in a standard iterative way , with the inner 75% of the bandpass combined and inspected for obviously bad samples . once all anomalous samples were excised from the calibrator data ,",
    "the frequency - independent calibration was applied to the object data , which were then edited .",
    "the calibration solutions had a maximum closure error of 1% in amplitude and 1  in phase .",
    "the ( frequency - dependent ) bandpass correction was applied using the secondary calibrator 3c 283 as reference , again following an iterative editing / calibrating method .",
    "application of the bandpass correction produced closure errors of 0.5% in amplitude and 0.5  in phase , however because of the limited integration time of the calibrator , the noise in the final data cube was increased by a factor of 1.8 . with the editing and calibration completed ,",
    "the @xmath31 data were hanning smoothed in velocity space .",
    "besides improving the signal - to - noise in individual channels , smoothing with a hanning kernel reduced the number of channels from 256 to 128 and made them independent , with channel width and separation equal at a value of 24.4 khz ( 5.17 ) .",

    "weighting visibilities based on their local population density or distance from the tracking center affects the strength of sidelobe structure .",
    "we applied two weighting schemes to improve the quality of the principal solution : first , the `` robust '' scheme developed by @xcite to produce a mixture of natural and uniform weighting with a single parameter ; and second , a gaussian taper function to downweight visibilities in the sparsely - sampled outer @xmath31 plane .",
    "we used the aips imagr  task @xcite and applied a variety of values for these two weighting schemes , empirically determining the best compromise between sidelobe structure , resolution and sensitivity .",
    "the best compromise among all the considerations was a robust value of 0 and a gaussian @xmath31-taper with @xmath34 k@xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the half - width at 30% of maximum .",
    "this weighting scheme increased the noise in the final image by a factor of 1.2 compared to pure natural weighting and no @xmath31-taper .",
    "a dirty image cube was produced from the full @xmath31 dataset , and channels free of  line emission were identified .",
    "the continuum was subtracted by fitting a first - order polynomial to 10 line - free channels on each edge of the band and subtracting this from all channels .",
    "a continuum - free dirty image cube was produced from this @xmath31 dataset , using a cell size of 7  per pixel and only including the central 105 channels to eliminate edge noise .    to correct for incomplete sampling in the @xmath31 plane and reduce the level of the sidelobes",
    ", one typically uses the dirty image to iteratively construct a model of the true brightness distribution .",
    "this is the strategy behind the clean algorithm @xcite , under which the brightness distribution is modeled iteratively as a set of @xmath37-function `` clean components '' .",
    "clean is very effective at removing sidelobes from point sources , since the clean components themselves are modeled as points .",
    "spatially - extended emission , however , is poorly modeled by a set of point sources .",
    "furthermore , while the strength of extended emission is usually relatively weak compared to a continuum point source , and thus the sidelobes associated with a single grid point often fall below the noise in a dirty map , the summation of sidelobes due to complex extended structure can be significant and difficult to disentangle .    to combat this problem , another method of image deconvolution was developed by @xcite .",
    "their multi - resolution clean ( mrc ) runs the clean algorithm , but operates on the point - like and extended sources separately .",
    "first , the dirty map and beam are smoothed then subtracted from the original map and beam to obtain a full - resolution difference map and beam .",
    "clean beams are constructed for the smooth and difference beams , and clean is performed on the smooth and difference maps separately . by performing clean on a smoothed map , two major improvements are made in reproducing extended emission : the clean beam is closer in size to the extended sources one is attempting to model ; and the signal - to - noise is improved , allowing detection of fainter sources .",
    "the original resolution is retained ( and point sources are deconvolved ) by cleaning the difference map separately and then combining the two resulting cleaned maps along with the full - resolution residuals . a detailed explanation of the method and the exact scaling parameters used are presented by @xcite .",
    "after trying standard clean and mrc and comparing the results , it was determined that mrc was more effective in removing sidelobes .",
    "our procedure was to clean the full region of each channel containing emission above the 3-@xmath33 level , then examine the map for remaining strong sidelobes , which were present in most of the channels .",
    "the output cube was spatially smoothed to twice the beam size and binned up by 5 channels , and regions that contained significant emission were manually delineated with polygons .",
    "the cleaning was repeated with mrc , using the original dirty cube and allowing clean components only within the specified region of each channel .",
    "successively deeper cleaning was performed , down to a threshold of 1-@xmath33 .",
    "the 1-@xmath33 noise level , calculated from the emission - free regions of each image plane , and other parameters for the cleaned data cube are summarized in table [ tab : m83hiparams ] .",
    "the noise of 0.94 mjy / beam is larger than the theoretical value of 0.7 mjy / beam for this instrumental setup and image weighting parameters , and this is likely a result of the bandpass calibration .",
    "the noise is similar from channel to channel , varying no more than 5% , as is shown in figure [ fig : m83channoise ] .    to reduce image size and ease further computational analysis ,",
    "the image cube was binned @xmath38 in space . with a final pixel size of 14 ,",
    "the @xmath39  ( fwhm ) synthesized beam is still well - sampled .",
    "noise was not reduced , however , since neighboring pixels are correlated .",
    "the channel maps for the cleaned data cube are shown in figure [ fig : m83chanmaps ] .",
    "the optical data for m 83 were taken with the 0.6 m curtis schmidt telescope located at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in march 1999 .",
    "use of a thinned site 2k ccd chip resulted in a field of view of nearly 70  with 2.3  square pixels . to reduce flat - fielding errors that could be produced by non - repeatable filter wheel positioning and",
    "dislodged dust particles , we used a single sloan  filter , keeping the filter wheel unchanged throughout the run .",
    "a standard observing scheme was followed , with twenty bias frames and six to eight twilight flats taken each evening , and standard star fields imaged at a range of airmass throughout the night .",
    "approximately half of the telescope time was spent imaging galaxies and half imaging blank sky flats , with exposure times of 15 minutes each .",
    "the total exposure times were 10 hours on source and 8.75 hours on blank sky .",
    "dark exposures taken during one cloudy night indicated no measurable ccd dark current .",
    "the initial reduction procedure followed a standard formula .",
    "the bias and overscan were removed from all twilight , sky and object frames .",
    "a first - order flatfield was created for each night from the twilights flats .",
    "this flatfield was applied to the sky flats , which were co - added and smoothed with a @xmath40 boxcar to remove stars .",
    "this sky correction image was normalized and multiplied by the first - order twilight flat field to produce a master flat field for each night , which was applied to the m 83 data .",
    "the individual galaxy frames were examined by eye , and eight of the 40 images contained undesirable features such as strong scattered light and were rejected .",
    "the remaining frames were sky - subtracted , aligned , and co - added . for proper noise estimation in future analysis , an average sky value of 4423 adu was added back in to the co - added frame .",
    "finally , the poorly - sampled outer regions were clipped , leaving a final 72@xmath4169  image with a total integration time of 8.0 hours .",
    "photometric calibration was accomplished with observations of standard stars .",
    "the number of standard stars for the sloan filter system was limited at the time of observations , but using a star list provided by j.a .",
    "smith ( private communication ) , we identified a number of standard stars within @xcite fields .",
    "nightly imaging of these fields yielded 50 observations of seven standard stars covering a range of airmasses ( @xmath42 ) and colors ( @xmath43 ) . for a pixel size of 5.31 square arcsec and an effective exposure time of 900 s ,",
    "the surface brightness corresponding to 1 adu pix@xmath44 in the final averaged galaxy frame was @xmath45  magnitudes per square arcsec .",
    "the average sky value of 4423 adu corresponds to a surface brightness of 21.04  magnitudes per square arcsec , and the pixel - to - pixel noise in the final image ( 6.5 adu ) corresponds to 28.1  magnitudes per square arcsec .",
    "our 3-@xmath33 limiting surface brightness is 26.9  magnitudes per square arcsec , not accounting for systematic errors caused by scattered light and large - scale flatfielding effects .",
    "foreground stars were removed by modeling the stellar point spread function ( psf ) and masking each star .",
    "using the daophot @xcite package in iraf , we estimated the brightness of all stars in the frame by searching for 3-@xmath33 peaks in the image and performing simple aperture photometry on them .",
    "this procedure produced 38,721 stellar objects ; of these , 11 bright , isolated stars were chosen to construct the psf .",
    "the psf stars had an average ( standardized ) brightness of = 16.3 , with one moderately saturated star included to improve the fit in the wings .",
    "the psf was constructed from the unsaturated regions of the psf stars , using an elliptical moffat function with @xmath46 as the analytic psf component plus a single look - up table for the residual psf component .",
    "the psf was scaled to each psf star and subtracted , leaving a residual image and revealing previously - unidentified stars in the psf stars wings .",
    "these were fit with the psf and removed from the original frame , and a new psf was constructed .",
    "this procedure was iterated several times until the companion stars were completely removed and the psf did not improve between iterations .",
    "once the psf was modeled , it was used to identify and measure all stars in the field . of the stars originally identified by aperture photometry",
    ", a subset of 33,950 were found to have profiles similar to the psf .",
    "this amounts to an average of 6.8 field stars per square arcmin , down to a detection limit of = 23.8 .",
    "the core of a star becomes saturated at @xmath47 , but by fitting to the unsaturated wings , stars down to @xmath48 could be reliably measured .",
    "stars were removed by masking each one out to the radius at which its flux fell below a specified threshold .",
    "this method is a compromise between elimination of polluting starlight and retention of usable data . to construct the mask ,",
    "the model psf was averaged radially to a 1-d function , scaled to each star according to its magnitude , and used to determine the radius at which the stellar flux fell below threshold .",
    "a threshold of 2 adu , well below the 7 adu rms noise in the co - added frame , was a satisfactory compromise between starlight removal and pixel retention .",
    "typical psf reference stars were masked out to a radius of 7 pixels ( 16 ) , and the brightest unsaturated stars were masked out to a radius of 9 pixels ( 21 ) , about 26 times larger than the average seeing hwhm of about 0.8 .",
    "+ figure  [ fig : m83chanmaps ] ( continued )     + figure  [ fig : m83chanmaps ] ( continued )    some contaminating features did not conform to the shape of the psf and were ignored by the above procedure .",
    "these included background galaxies , very bright saturated stars , diffraction spikes , and charge transfer ( `` bleeding '' ) features , and they were masked by hand .",
    "the bulk distribution and kinematics of emission - line gas are most easily summarized by moment maps , including the total  surface brightness ( 0th moment ) and the intensity - weighted mean velocity field ( 1st moment ) . to construct the moment maps ,",
    "the image cube was first smoothed spatially to a round beam of 52  fwhm , roughly 1.5 times the size of the original synthesized beam .",
    "this smoothing is done to improve the s / n and ensure that the faint extended components of emission peaks are included in the summation .",
    "pixels with flux greater than 4-@xmath33 were included , as were immediate neighbor pixels in both space and velocity .",
    "the moment maps are shown in figures [ fig : m83mom0 ] and [ fig : m83mom1 ] .",
    "the primary beam attenuation correction was applied to only the moment 0 map ( which is shown in column density units ) after integrating in velocity . throughout this work ,",
    "all  intensity maps displaying either integrated  emission or  column density have been corrected for the primary beam sensitivity .",
    "the total  mass determined from the  surface brightness map is 4.7 .",
    "this is lower than the distance - corrected value of 6.1 obtained by @xcite , who mapped the emission out to about twice the radius as the present study .",
    "their single - dish scans were impervious to zero - spacing issues of interferometry and recovered all of the emission in the beam .",
    "our result is therefore in reasonable agreement with their value .",
    "the total  map ( figure [ fig : m83mom0 ] ) is a good tracer of spatial morphology , and it shows a number of notable features . the inner disk of m 83 contains a minimum in the  approximately 1  ( 1.3 kpc ) in diameter , with a measured column density of 4 .",
    "this feature is surrounded by the inner gaseous disk , which extends to a radius of 6  ( 8 kpc ) and ranges in column density from a minimum of 7  to a ( probably optically thick ) maximum of 1.7 .",
    "the inner disk shows a hint of spiral structure , with an irregular pattern of bright spots , and an aspect ratio close to unity , as one would expect for a nearly face - on galaxy .",
    "the small - scale structure is unresolved in our map , but it agrees qualitatively with the results of @xcite , who studied m 83 at higher spatial resolution .    beyond 5 , the  brightness falls off abruptly , with @xmath49  in the region immediately around the inner disk . in the regions",
    "ne and sw of the inner disk , the column density becomes very low , approaching 5 .",
    "further out , there is evidence of a bright ring of  at a radius of 10  ( 13 kpc ) .",
    "the ring has a peak column density of 1 , similar to the inner disk , and the projected thickness varies between 60  and 80 . with the smoothed beam size ( 52 )",
    "this scale is unresolved , but the width can be no more than 1  ( 1.3 kpc ) after removal of the instrumental profile .",
    "the emission in the ring appears clumpy , with the brightest region in an arc on the west side of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , the aspect ratio of the ring is quite different from that of the inner disk , with semi - major and semi - minor axes of 10  and 5 respectively .",
    "the position angle is close to that of the inner disk ( see below ) .",
    "outside of the ring , the  spatial distribution becomes irregular , with arms and streams at various projected orientations .",
    "one arm appears just beyond the ring on the nw side , and spans about 25  ( 33 kpc ) to a point 16  ( 21 kpc ) ne of the disk center .",
    "there is a corresponding arm on the se to s side of the galaxy , at a similar projected distance .",
    "two notable features are the arms further west of this , which extend from a common point 14  ( 18 kpc ) west of the center and extend toward the north .",
    "the longer of these arms reaches a projected galactic radius of 26  ( 34 kpc ) and is clearly detached from the rest of the disk .",
    "both nw arms appear to be mirrored in the se , and similar mirroring can be seen between other features and clumps in the extended . since the primary antenna sensitivity falls to 10% of the central value for the most extended arms , these features could be even more extended than observed .",
    "it is clear that the arms are distinct from the main  disk , down to our detection limit .",
    "the symmetrical nature and varying orientations of the outer arms indicates either a warp that varies with radius or a collection of kinematically distinct orbiting streams .",
    "analysis of the kinematic morphology can improve our understanding of the complex outer disk features , and this is most thoroughly done by combining the velocity field map , the individual channel maps , and the data cube as a whole .",
    "the velocity map is presented in both figure [ fig : m83mom0 ] ( as contours ) and figure [ fig : m83mom1 ] ( as an image map and contours ) . in both figures ,",
    "the inner disk shows a typical differential rotation pattern ( a so - called `` spider diagram '' ) , with a central systemic value of @xmath50 . to estimate the systemic velocity and orientation",
    ", we fit the central 5  with a brandt rotation curve using the gal task in aips @xcite . we find a systemic velocity of @xmath51 , where the error is estimated from the spread of best - fit values at different radii , and using the optical definition @xmath52 .",
    "the best - fit position angle is @xmath53 ( measured to the receding side from north to east ) , and the best - fit inclination is @xmath54 .",
    "our estimates of the inner  disk parameters are consistent with previous results .",
    "previous values for the systemic velocity range from 505  determined by @xcite through  interferometry to 516  quoted by @xcite and determined by  observations .",
    "the hipass bright galaxy catalog reports a value of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we adopt 513  as the systemic velocity for the remainder of this work .",
    "our estimates of the orientation and inclination are consistent with the those quoted by @xcite , who have data with higher spatial resolution .",
    "therefore we adopt @xmath56 for our inclination , and note that the maximum rotation rate of the inner disk is @xmath57 .",
    "outside of the inner disk , a discontinuity develops in the rotational velocity .",
    "this is most clearly seen in figure [ fig : m83mom0 ] , where the velocity contours bend abruptly into a warp , and in the channel maps for 440 @xmath58 540  ( see figure [ fig : m83chanmaps ] ) . on the w side of the galaxy ,",
    "the warp correlates well with the  ring in projection , but on the e side the warp peaks inside of the ring .",
    "the isovelocity contours are shifted by 2  counter - clockwise from where they would be under ordinary differential galactic rotation . beyond the ring ,",
    "the isovelocity contours switch direction again , and they no longer reflect a flat rotation curve . in addition , the aspect ratio of the disk increases in this region , indicating that the axis of rotation is becoming more inclined to our line of sight as the radius increases .",
    "the highest radial velocities are seen near the very edge of the detected distribution , at a distance of 8  ( 11 kpc ) n and s of the galactic center .",
    "it is apparent from this analysis that the inner disk , the ring , and the outer arms are kinematically distinct features .",
    "the ring and outer arms could be considered anomalous features themselves , however we wish to search for anomalous - velocity emission superposed on the bulk emission , and for this purpose we assume the outer arms are part of an extended disk of varying inclination .",
    "the final optical image for m 83 shows many of the typical features of a face - on , grand - design spiral galaxy ( see figure [ fig : m83opt ] ) .",
    "the spiral arms are seen radiating from a central bar - like structure , and these arms contain a number of star clusters and dust lanes .",
    "the integrated  intensity traces the spiral arms closely .",
    "the spiral structure is apparent only out to a radius of about 4.5  ( 6 kpc ) in the north and 5.5  ( 7 kpc ) in the south , at which point the surface brightness has dropped to 22.5  magnitudes per square arcsec .",
    "this is the same radius at which the inner  disk falls off abruptly and at which the warp in the velocity field appears .    beyond the inner optical disk",
    ", there is an extended optical envelope devoid of any structure .",
    "this envelope reaches a surface brightness of 26  mag per square arcsec at a radius of about 10  ( 13 kpc ) , falling to undetectable levels at the location of the  ring .",
    "in addition , the aspect ratio of the extended light , appearing stretched northeast to southwest , is different from that of the inner disk , which is nearly circular .",
    "an arc - like feature can be seen projected 20  ( 26 kpc ) northwest of center , extending 12  ( 16 kpc ) northeast to southwest .",
    "this feature is barely visible in the palomar sky survey plate covering this region , and it has been cataloged as a dwarf galaxy by @xcite , who designate it kk208 . the surface brightness across the feature varies from 2526  mag per square arcsec , although there are three bright stars along the arc that complicate masking and flux measurements .",
    "there is no measurable  anywhere along the feature down to a 3-@xmath33 column density limit of 1.5 .",
    "the arc lies between two outer  arms , and it has a shape similar to those arms .",
    "to search for anomalous - velocity material , one must first establish the criteria that make such material `` anomalous '' .",
    "the difficulty of this can be appreciated by considering the ensemble of galactic hvcs . a commonly - used definition limits membership to complexes with velocities deviating by greater than 100  ( or sometimes 90 ) relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "this definition was intended to separate the hvcs from the so - called intermediate velocity clouds ( ivcs ) and gas in the plane .",
    "however , such a definition does not take into account differential galactic rotation , an effect which can vary the observed velocity of a cloud by as much as 100 , depending on the line of sight direction @xcite . to account for this effect",
    ", some authors have used the velocity relative to the so - called galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) , which is a point at the location of the sun that does not participate in galactic rotation .",
    "this definition works well for gas at high @xmath59 .",
    "however , it over - corrects the velocity of any cloud that has a rotational component of motion , such as may be found closer to the plane .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of `` deviation velocity , '' which is the difference between the observed lsr velocity of the cloud and the maximum velocity expected along that line of sight due to differential rotation , assuming a simple model for the gaseous galactic disk . at low latitudes in the milky way",
    "this varies greatly , but at latitudes above @xmath60 the velocity limit is around 60 .    for external spiral galaxies , and especially face - on galaxies ,",
    "the situation is simplified in that the bulk disk velocity is easily measured along any line of sight .",
    "material at velocities different from this , assuming some velocity threshold or kinematic model for the disk , would be kinematically distinct from the cold  disk and therefore anomalous .",
    "hereafter we define anomalous - velocity material to be any  emission that does not participate in the normal differential rotation of the bulk of  along that line of sight .",
    "implicit in the definition is the inclusion of spatially isolated  clumps , since the disk rotation is undefined in regions where the disk does not exist . therefore an anomalous - velocity clump ( hereafter avc or av gas )",
    "can be anomalous in velocity or position .    as low - velocity av gas could overlap and merge with the disk velocity , it is useful to remove any  disk emission . additionally , it is important to ignore this emission in a non - interactive source detection scheme .",
    "we modeled the disk of m 83 by fitting a gaussian to the spectrum along every pixel of the cleaned image cube .",
    "the fitting was performed only along lines of sight where the peak exceeded 3.5-@xmath33 ( 3.3 mjy / beam ) , and only included channels whose flux exceeded 1.7-@xmath33 ( 1.6 mjy / beam ) .",
    "these criteria were applied to ensure that faint , velocity - broadened emission would not contaminate the thin disk fit .",
    "disk fitting and removal failed at warp discontinuities , where the disk has multiple velocity components across a scale of about 1 .",
    "it is not clear whether this spatial overlap of kinematically distinct disk components is a real feature or an effect of beam smearing , but in either case it poses a difficulty for effective disk removal .",
    "it is clear that the warp features are not av material in our definition , since they define the disk velocity .",
    "we therefore attempted to remove this emission by refitting the original data cube with multiple gaussian components . for lines - of - sight where",
    "the residual flux matched the above single - gaussian criteria ( i.e. , peak above 3.5-@xmath33 , 3 or more adjacent pixels with flux above 1.7-@xmath33 ) , a two - component gaussian was fit .",
    "the fitting threshold was kept high so that true av gas would escape the fit .    to estimate the quality of the disk model",
    ", we examined the reduced @xmath61 and covariance matrices of all the fits performed .",
    "the fits that included only a few data points were obviously poorly constrained , but inspection of the residual data cube showed that even these fits were reasonable .",
    "there were several lines - of - sight that had noticeably bad fits , but these were generally isolated pixels whose neighbors had similar parameters to each other . to remove the outliers , we performed a median box filtering on the fitting parameter images , using a kernel width of 3 pixels .",
    "the disk model and residual cube were reproduced from the adjusted fitting parameters , and inspection showed that the poor fits were removed and the disk subtraction was improved .",
    "the fitted line - of - sight velocity dispersion varies across the galaxy , as can be seen in figure [ fig : m83gparsig ] .",
    "it reaches a maximum of 20  in the center , averages about 15  in the central  disk and ring , and falls to 10  or less in the extended disk and arms .",
    "removal of the  disk results in a residual cube with significant emission remaining .",
    "for ease of display , we created position - velocity ( ) plots , or slices through velocity along a line of specified location , length , and position angle .",
    "the slices were taken parallel to the major axis at a spacing of 70  ( twice the beamwidth ) .",
    "the value of a given pixel in the  image equals the distance - weighted average of the nearest four pixels in the channel .",
    "a sample of slices is shown in figure [ fig : m83slices ] for both the full data cube and the residual .",
    "ccccccc full residual cube & 203.0 & 97.0 & 21.0 + inner disk & 17.6 & 8.4 & 16.0 + inner disk , low-@xmath62 & 11.8 & 5.6 & 8.7 +    comparison of the slices with and without the disk emission clearly shows an emission component not well modeled by differential galactic rotation .",
    "this is especially evident along the major axis .",
    "the anomalous component is spatially extended and clumpy , with deviation velocities generally @xmath6350  near the emission peak along any line of sight . the emission generally appears brighter on one velocity wing of the disk , toward the systemic galactic velocity .",
    "some of the anomalous emission occurs in the `` forbidden '' velocity region , which is the  quadrant on the opposite side of the systemic velocity from the disk .",
    "one interpretation is that material at velocities between the disk and galactic systemic would be rotating more slowly than the bulk of material in the galaxy .",
    "material in the forbidden  region would be moving in the opposite sense of the bulk rotation along that line of sight , i.e. , counter - rotating .",
    "these interpretations assume the disk and anomalous material have similar spatial distribution and rotation axis orientation . in a face - on galaxy like m 83 , material in the forbidden region is likely to be in vertical motion .     + figure  [ fig : m83slices ] ( continued )    to quantify the amount of av gas in m 83 , we constructed column density and mean velocity maps from the residual cube ( see figure [ fig : m83beard1 ] ) .",
    "the dynamical properties of the av  were determined from these maps and are summarized in table [ tab : m83beard ] .",
    "the mass of av  in the residual cube is 9.7 , corresponding to 20% of the total .",
    "it was apparent that poor subtraction of the  ring / warp and outer arms contaminated the residual cube , therefore we manually defined a region containing only anomalous emission projected on the central disk .",
    "the region used was an ellipse centered on the galaxy with a semi - major axis of 6.0(radius of 8 kpc ) , a semi - minor axis of 4.5 , and a position angle of 45 as shown in figures [ fig : m83beard1 ] .",
    "this area contains the most dynamically homogeneous disk gas and produced reasonable model parameters . the total  mass in this region , including the cold disk , is 1.02 , of which 8.4  or 8.2% is present in the anomalous component ( `` inner disk '' in table [ tab : m83beard ] ) .",
    "the low - relative - velocity emission contributes 5.6  or 5.5% of the total inner disk .",
    "the velocity field shows two high - velocity spots to the east and west of the galaxy center , identified by rectangles in figure [ fig : m83beard1 ] .",
    "these features are also seen on the high relative velocity side of the  slices , including one structure @xmath64  along the @xmath65  diagram in figure [ fig : m83slices ] , at velocities between @xmath3050 and @xmath30100 . in a simple model of disk rotation",
    ", these clumps would be rotating more quickly than the bulk of the .",
    "they are discrete in projection compared to the low relative velocity component described above , and will be discussed in detail in section [ sect : m83:hiavcs ] ( as avcs 1 and 2 ) .    aside from these features , the motion and morphology of the residual emission mimic that of the galactic disk , with the southwest side receding and the northeast side approaching .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion ranges from 1015 , similar to the thin disk , although this may be an underestimate if the wings of the anomalous emission are excluded in the thin disk mask .",
    "a map of deviation velocity was produced by subtracting the velocity map of the modeled disk from that of the residual cube ( see figure [ fig : m83beard2 ] ) , and it shows a rotation rate 4050  slower in projection .",
    "if the inclination of this disk of av emission is also about 20 , then its rotation rate is about 100150 , compared to 200  for the cold disk .",
    "we used the deviation velocities to construct a map of the kinetic energy with respect to the cold disk ( see figure [ fig : m83beard2 ] ) . unlike the previous analysis",
    ", this interpretation assumes all motion is perpendicular to the galaxy plane - direction motion . ] , and it provides an upper limit to the energy apportioned to vertical bulk motion .",
    "the total kinetic energy so derived is 2.1 erg , with 1.6 erg from gas within the inner disk and 8.7 erg of that from the low - relative - velocity material .",
    "the last figure excludes discrete clumps , such as the one projected 2  northwest of center ; these features possess nearly half of the kinetic energy of the inner av gas , and are fully discussed in section [ sect : m83:hiavcs ] .",
    "the 1.6 erg from the inner 8 kpc is equivalent to the energy of @xmath66 supernovae kpc@xmath67 , although the @xmath16 component of velocity is not known for this material , so this is an upper limit to the kinetic energy .",
    "while the distribution of extended gas is well - characterized by moment maps and  slices , faint , compact emission sources are easily overlooked .",
    "detection of such systems requires a quantitative , objective searching technique that utilizes the entire set of data in a statistical way .",
    "the next section addresses our search for faint , discrete  emission sources .",
    "compared to other observational subfields of astronomy , radio synthesis imaging suffers from a lack of robust , objective source detection software .",
    "identifying sources and measuring their fluxes and other parameters is typically done by hand from moment maps and similar data products . for bright , point - like sources ,",
    "this is not a problem , but difficulties arise when one wishes to search statistically for emission of unknown scale and location that may be projected on much stronger sources .",
    "we have developed a suite of software that searches a 3-d data cube for signal in a statistical way .",
    "the software is described in detail in appendix [ app : snrch ] and summarized here .",
    "the data cube is smoothed with a tunable velocity filter to emphasize sources of a particular velocity width , following the method of @xcite .",
    "peaks in this smoothed cube are identified and used to define 3-d `` islands '' of emission by way of contouring , using a variation of the clumpfind algorithm developed by @xcite . the velocity smoothing allows detection of kinematically broad but statistically significant features that might otherwise be overlooked .",
    "in addition , this algorithm allows a quantitative analysis of errors with the use of simulated datasets .    to search for discrete sources",
    ", we masked the residual  cube within @xmath68  of the  disk velocity to remove poorly - subtracted emission in the center of the disk profile .",
    "we ran the software with a peak threshold of 4-@xmath33 , a clump merging threshold of 2.5-@xmath33 , and a clump extending threshold of 1-@xmath33 .",
    "the width of the gaussian filtering kernel was varied from 39 channels ( 1545 ) . for sources that were detected at multiple filter widths",
    ", we used the results from the filtering that produced the highest s / n ( i.e. , the kernel that was closest in width to the unsmoothed feature ) . the spatial and kinematic morphology of the candidate clouds was analyzed interactively using a variety of tools , including  plots , channel maps and 3-d visual rendering tools .",
    "a two - component gaussian fit along the velocity axis at the clump centroid recovered the velocity and line width of the clump , as well as the line width of any  disk emission along that line of sight .",
    "finally , the flux of each clump was verified by hand using the standard radio method of aperture photometry .",
    "values were consistent with the results from our automated software .",
    "we discovered 14 discrete clouds of  emission at anomalous velocities or positions in the m 83 data cube .",
    "these anomalous - velocity clumps ( avcs ) are distinct from the bulk of the  disk emission in that their contours of emission detach from the disk at levels approaching the map noise .",
    "the avc properties are given in tables [ tab : m83avcs1 ] and [ tab : m83avcs2 ] .",
    "the locations of the avcs are shown superposed on the  column density map in figure [ fig : m83mom0avcs ] and superposed on the velocity map in figure [ fig : m83mom1avcs ] .",

    "second ,  emission could appear at velocities between systemic and the disk , i.e. , on the low - relative velocity wing of the disk profile .",
    "this emission could be spatially extended ( spanning a few kpc ) if small - scale condensations are suppressed @xcite .",

    "the face - on inclination of m 83 makes it difficult to model the rotation of the beard component in the same way as @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "it is also not clear whether the anomalous disk is radially infalling as is the case of ngc 2403 , nor is it clear how vertically extended the material is .",
    "if the beard is the result of a galactic fountain , it is likely that it represents material near maximum @xmath16 because of its low velocity , and it probably is gas that has recently condensed and is beginning to fall back onto the disk .",

    "a supernova rate of 0.01  yr@xmath44 is consistent with this if only 1% of the energy is converted to kinetic energy .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile the presence of avcs projected outside the stellar disk with the galactic fountain model , thus there is likely another hvc production scenario at work .",

    "our field of view is insufficient to include this region , but it is further evidence of a tidal interaction that can strip diffuse material and produce anomalous emission .",
    "our results are sensitive enough to place constraints on the mass distribution of the hvc ensemble in m 83 and , by extension , the milky way . because of the variable mass sensitivity across the field , we restrict our analysis to avcs detected within the hpbw of the primary beam .",
    "we assume that the full distribution of m 83 hvcs falls within this region , which is a reasonable assumption if the vertical distance @xmath16 is less than about 50 kpc ( and @xmath117 kpc or 15 ) .",
    "only the eight confirmed detections lie within the primary hpbw , and we scale our estimates of the false detection rate to the reduced number of independent sightlines we are now sampling .",
    "five of the eight detected clumps have masses in a region where the false detection rate is significant ( greater than 0.1 detection expected per mass bin ) , while the remaining avcs are much more massive and unlikely to be spurious .",
    "assuming a poisson distribution for false detections , and using the integrated false detection rate as the mean `` background '' expected for a mass bin , we determine the background - corrected mass distribution with 90% confidence limits .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : m83mwmasscomp ] , using the tabulated data of @xcite to calculate confidence limits for low number counts .",
    "we obtain upper limits above an hvc mass of @xmath118 and below a mass of @xmath119 ; below @xmath120 , the completeness falls below 50% , so we have cut off the distribution at this point .    to draw conclusions about the galactic hvc population , two simplifying assumptions must be made .",
    "first , we assume that the underlying hvc mass distributions are identical for the milky way and m 83 .",
    "second , we assume the galactic hvcs are contained in a uniform spherical distribution about the galactic center .",
    "while this is likely incorrect , it is a sensible choice given our lack of knowledge of their distances .",
    "the collection of galactic hvcs across the whole sky has been cataloged by @xcite , and excluding the magellanic stream and outer galactic arm , we randomly assign distances drawn from the assumed distribution to the cataloged hvcs . the assigned distances and cataloged  fluxes produce an estimate of the galactic hvc mass distribution .",
    "this procedure was repeated 500 times to fill in the high - mass regions , and the resulting distribution was scaled to the number of hvcs in the catalog ( 560 ) .",
    "the derived hvc mass distribution is plotted in figure [ fig : m83mwmasscomp ] for four different mean galactic hvc distances , along with the hvc mass distribution for m 83 .",
    "while the confidence limits are large , it is clear that an ensemble distance of less than about 25 kpc is consistent with the m 83 distribution , while a larger average distance results in a larger number of massive clouds . such clouds would have been easily visible in our m 83 observations .",
    "it is possible that some hvcs in m 83 could fall outside the hpbw and therefore be missed if the distance is much greater than 50 kpc , however even at 50 kpc we detect an order of magnitude fewer hvcs than should be present in m 83 .",
    "in addition , the heliocentric distances are upper limits to the more fundamental @xmath16 height of the hvcs , therefore the distances of the hvcs from the plane are consistent with being less than about 10 kpc . finally ,",
    "if the hvcs cataloged by @xcite are not distinct but rather clumps within larger complexes , then the mass distribution derived here will underestimate the number of high - mass hvcs , and the constraints imposed by our results would be stronger .",

    "they are generally unresolved , off - disk features and are free of diffuse optical light to a limiting surface brightness of 27  mag per square arcsec .",
    "we conclude that a combination of a galactic fountain and tidal stripping are responsible for the anomalous  features that we observe in m 83 .",
    "the handful of hvcs we have detected are likely to represent the high - mass end of a substantial hvc population in this galaxy .",
    "we expect future deep  observations of nearby spirals to add to the growing number of hvc analogs detected in external galaxies , and to thereby shed light on the ubiquity of hvc activity and the nature of our own galaxy s gaseous neighborhood .",
    "we thank the staff of the vla and ctio for their assistance with the planning and execution of these observations .",
    "we especially thank jonathan williams and juan uson for providing access to and help with their source detection software code , and the anonmyous referee for constructive comments that improved the manuscript .",
    "edm would like to thank mario mateo , hugh aller , and tim mckay for their helpful suggestions toward the improvement of this work .",
    "we have developed a suite of software that searches a spatially - coherent , 3-d data cube for signal in a statistical way .",
    "this software borrows heavily from the methods and code developed by @xcite and @xcite , but as we have made variations to the methods and translated much of the code to a new programming language , we here describe the new software in some detail .        where @xmath123 is the width of the particular gaussian .",
    "the convolution is performed by a fast fourier transform . if one assumes a gaussian velocity profile for a clump of emission , the signal due to this feature as a function of channel or frequency @xmath62 would be      and the smoothing function acts as a matched filter , enhancing features of similar width and de - emphasizing narrower or wider features . in a given channel ,",
    "the normalized amplitude of the smoothed feature is given by      where the integral is taken over the entire feature .",
    "this value is maximized when @xmath126 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath127 is such that the amplitude of the smoothed feature will equal the amplitude of the original feature under this same condition ; otherwise , the smoothed amplitude will be depressed compared to the unsmoothed value .",
    "if we assume that neighboring channels are independent and the noise ( given as @xmath129 for channel @xmath130 ) sums in quadrature .",
    "the noise in each channel is determined by reflecting the negative portion of the data histogram across the mean and performing an iterative 4-@xmath33 rejection until the measured @xmath33 converges . the significance level (",
    "s / n ) is calculated as @xmath131 and written to disk as a data cube .",
    "peaks in s / n are identified down to some detection threshold , typically around 4-@xmath33 , with neighboring above - threshold pixels merged into groups .",
    "these 3-d groups or `` islands '' serve as kernels for an iterative contouring scheme , with successively lower thresholds applied to the s / n cube .",
    "each group is extended by adding new pixels that are above threshold and share at least two corners with any member pixel .",
    "that is , only neighbors that share at least one dimensional plane with the member are added , so that neighbors at a diagonal in all three dimensions are excluded . the algorithm for this procedure",
    "is based on the clumpfind software developed by @xcite .",
    "the contours are produced in intervals ( which only affect the processing speed ) down to a specified level , typically 3-@xmath33 , iterating at each level until no new neighbors are added to any groups and merging groups which meet the neighbor criterion .",
    "finally , any immediate neighbors ( i.e. , sharing four corners or two parameter planes ) above 1.5-@xmath33 are added to each group to improve flux measurements .",
    "no merging or iterating is done at this point .",
    "groups are eliminated if they contain fewer pixels than a completely unresolved source ( 10 pixels in our case ) , as these features are unphysical .",
    "the group ids are written to a data cube , which is applied to the original data cube as a mask for each group in turn .",
    "the total flux , centroid , and other parameters of the group are determined from the original data cube , using only the pixels that are members of the group .",
    "the primary beam correction is applied at this point , and the corrected flux and mass are recorded along with the uncorrected parameters .                                                                                                                                                              , b. , dalcanton , j.  j. , martinez - delgado , d. , west , a.  a. , blanton , m.  r. , hogg , d.  w. , barentine , j.  c. , brewington , h.  j. , harvanek , m. , kleinman , s.  j. , krzesinski , j. , long , d. , neilsen , jr .",
