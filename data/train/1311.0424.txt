    "particulate systems consisting of a large number of particles have attracted significant attention in the last decades . despite significant research on these systems , their properties are still not well understood and some of them appear to be rather elusive .",
    "the fact that the forces do not propagate uniformly in systems made of interacting particles has been established in a number of different systems , including granular matter , colloids , gels , emulsions and foams , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "it is well accepted that the interparticle forces play a key role in determining the mechanical properties of static and dynamic systems ; see e.g.  @xcite for an extensive review of the role of interaction networks in the context of amorphous solids .",
    "however there are no universal methods for describing and quantifying relevant aspects of the interparticle forces .",
    "for example , even the commonly used notion of ` force chain '  which we take to mean a connected set of particles interacting by a larger than average force  is not generally defined .",
    "one important goal of this paper is to present a method that can be used to describe precisely global properties of force networks in both static and dynamic settings .",
    "forces between interacting particles have been considered extensively from statistical point of view , in particular in the context of dense granular matter ( dgm ) .",
    "for example , the works by radjai and collaborators , see , e.g.  @xcite , discussed the differences in the probability density functions of strong and weak forces ( distinguished by the forces being larger or smaller than the average one ) arising in simulations ; behringer and collaborators explored these forces in the experimental systems built from photoelastic particles , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "possible universality of the force distributions has been considered  @xcite , as well as the connections between force and contact networks  @xcite .",
    "these works have provided a significant insight into statistical properties of the force distributions but by design do not focus on the structural properties of force networks .",
    "only recently , attempts have been made to move beyond purely statistical description and consider in more detail the properties of these networks .",
    "examples of recent studies include works by tordesillas and collaborators , see  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "these studies include extensive discussion of local properties of networks of forces based on the forces that particles experience and on their connectivity , including appropriately defined force chains and force cycles with a particular emphasis on cycles of length 3 and 4 .",
    "furthermore , these studies introduce mesoscopic network properties such as degree , clustering coefficient and centrality which describe particle arrangements .",
    "averaging these properties over the entire network allows to discuss the connection between the changes observed in the macroscopic network properties to the underlying structural rearrangements of the material .",
    "alternative approaches use network - type of analysis to discuss the properties of force networks  @xcite .",
    "these works provide a significant new insight and confirm that the properties of force networks are relevant in the context of propagation of acoustic signals  @xcite , fracture  @xcite , and compression and shear  @xcite .",
    "topology based approach has been considered as well , with focus on the contact network topology in isotropically compressed  @xcite and tapped granular media  @xcite .",
    "a similar approach is considered in our recent work  @xcite , where we discuss connectivity of force networks , including the dependence of the number of connected components and holes / loops ( quantified by the betti numbers ) , on the ( normal ) force between the particles .",
    "while that work uncovered some intricate properties of force networks and allowed to connect the results of topology based analysis to the ones obtained using standard percolation - based approach , it was still based essentially on counting components and loops at fixed magnitudes of force .",
    "as such , it thus does not provide an understanding of how these geometric structures persist through different magnitudes of the force .",
    "in @xcite we introduced the use of persistent homology  @xcite to dgm .",
    "more recently , these ideas have been employed in the context of tapped systems  @xcite .",
    "conceptually persistent homology is preferable to the above mentioned betti number analysis . by design persistent homology measures the same geometric structures as the betti number analysis , but simultaneously records how these structures appear , disappear or persist through different magnitudes of the force .",
    "thus , two networks of forces could produce identical information on the level of betti numbers , i.e. , the number of connected components and loops , but still have distinct global structures in the sense that as one varies the magnitudes of the forces the relationships between the connected components and loops are different .",
    "therefore , the results presented in  @xcite provide better quantification of the properties of considered force networks and shed new light on the differences between the systems that differ by their frictional properties and particle size distributions .",
    "it should be noted however , that persistent homology is an abstract tool .",
    "hence , there is considerable freedom as to how it can be employed . in this paper",
    "we provide a firm mathematical background for using persistent homology in the context of dgm .",
    "in addition , we discuss different concepts for constructing and comparing the persistence diagrams .",
    "this allows us to compare the features of different force networks both locally and globally and hence is complementary to the approaches , discussed above , that consider local properties of force networks .",
    "furthermore , the ability to compare different force networks is crucial for quantifying the dynamical properties of dgm .    in the next section",
    "we give an overview of persistence homology and the structure of the paper .",
    "in this paper we introduce the concept of a force network , which is designed to model force interactions between the particles .",
    "the definition varies depending on available form of the data , but every force network is described by a scalar function @xmath0 .",
    "the domain @xmath1 models the particles and the function @xmath2 models the forces .",
    "persistent homology is used to reduce the function @xmath2 to a collection of points in the plane .",
    "this collection of points is called a _ persistence diagram _ and denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "each point in the persistence diagram encodes a well defined geometric feature of @xmath2 .",
    "it is useful to view persistent homology as a mapping from scalar functions to persistence diagrams , e.g.@xmath4 .",
    "stated more formally , persistent homology can be viewed as a function from a space of scalar functions to a space of persistence diagrams .",
    "a fundamental result is that with appropriate metrics on the space of functions and on the space of persistence diagrams , persistent homology is a continuous function @xcite .",
    "at least theoretically this implies that bounded noise or small errors in measurement of the dgm will lead to a small change in the associated persistence diagram .",
    "this theoretical potential combined with the successful applications presented in @xcite suggests the need for a careful analysis of the practical details of applying persistent homology to dgm .",
    "there are at least three specific issues that need to be addressed :    1 .",
    "given a particular form of the experimental or numerical data , how can one perform the persistent homology computations ? 2 .",
    "having chosen a method by which the persistent homology computations are being performed , how robust is the resulting persistence diagram as a function of experimental or numerical noise or errors ? 3 .",
    "how can the information provided by the persistence diagrams be used to analyze dgm ?    addressing these issues in the context of dgm is the main focus of this paper .",
    "the first step in the construction of the force network is to establish the domain @xmath1 on which the function @xmath2 representing the force interactions is defined .",
    "a contact network seems to be a natural candidate for the domain @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , if positions and shapes of the particles are known , then one can construct a contact network .",
    "if the data is in the form of a digital image , then building a contact network is more complicated . in section  [ sec : particle ]",
    "we start by introducing _",
    "digital _ and _ position _ networks that are closely related to contact networks .",
    "we investigate their stability with respect to measurement errors and show that their topology can considerably differ from topology of the physical system they represent .",
    "therefore we propose an alternative domain , the _ interaction _ network .",
    "this is an abstract mathematical concept and its topology is not related to topology of the physical system it represents .",
    "however , it provides a fixed domain for describing the force networks in dgm .",
    "section  [ sec : homology ] introduces homology , which can be crudely interpreted as a tool for counting connected components , loops and cavities .",
    "the advantages of homology are that it supports efficient algorithms , can be used in higher dimensions , and allows one to compare components , loops , and cavities over different spaces .",
    "section  [ sec : force ] introduces force networks , clarifying the connection between the type of available data and formulation of appropriate network .",
    "section  [ sec : persistence ] focuses on persistence homology , our principal tool for analyzing the force networks .",
    "the interaction network can be used in the setting of numerical simulations or experiments ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , where complete information about the forces between adjacent particles is known . however , for many experiments only the total force experienced by a particle may be available  @xcite .",
    "this necessitates the use of a digital or position network . in section  [ sec : space ]",
    "we discuss the space of persistence diagrams , in particular the appropriate metrics on the space , and we provide a theorem that justifies the claim that the interaction force networks are optimal .    in section  [ sec : interpph ]",
    "we conclude with a review of the developed concepts in the context of dgm data obtained by discrete element based simulations ( des ) . we choose to work with numerical simulations since",
    "all the data is available with high precision and therefore we can process them through all three force network constructions ( digital , position , and interaction ) .",
    "this allows for greater clarity in interpreting the geometric meaning of the persistence diagrams , greater ease in comparing the results of the different networks , and simplicity in testing for stability with respect to perturbations .",
    "the reader who is familiar with the language of persistent homology may wish to skip directly to this section , before examining the details of the constructions .",
    "we note that the focus of this section is not on reaching general conclusions about the force networks in dgm , but on describing how the tools of persistence homology _ can _ be used to extract detailed information about these networks . for this purpose",
    ", we provide a few selected examples of the simulation data and discuss application of persistence homology to these examples .",
    "more interpretation - oriented discussion that focuses on the connection between persistence homology and physical properties of dgm is given in  @xcite .",
    "there are several points that we encourage the reader to keep in mind while reviewing section  [ sec : interpph ] .",
    "first , we provide examples of two dimensional force networks in order to facilitate the reader s intuition about the described features , however our analysis is based exclusively on the information contained in the persistence diagrams .",
    "this is particularly important in the context of three dimensional systems , where visual inspection may be impossible .",
    "second , in our examples we mostly concentrate on the magnitude of the normal force between particles , but in principle any function that assigns a scalar value to every edge can be used .",
    "we illustrate this point by briefly considering tangential forces .",
    "finally , although this paper is focused on dgm , the constructions are independent of the details of particle - particle interaction and could as well be applied to any other system consisting of interacting particles .",
    "the software used to build the various force networks @xcite and to compute persistence diagrams @xcite is available in the public domain .",
    "in the introduction the force network is described by a scalar function @xmath5 . the first step towards using algebraic topology to characterize the geometric structures associated with dgm is to represent the domain @xmath1 as a finite complex , defined below .",
    "we introduce three complexes motivated by the type of data commonly obtained from experiments or simulations .",
    "consider figure  [ fig : complexes](a ) that shows a small portion of an image of a collection of photoelastic disks .",
    "we interpret this information in three ways :    digital : :    this figure arises from a digital image and thus the data can be    viewed as a collection of a large number of pixels .",
    "positions : :    since this is a controlled experiment involving circular disks , the    configuration of the particles ( locations of their center points and    their radii ) can be determined .",
    "interactions : :    the particles are made of photoelastic material and thus the light    intensities within the particles can be used to determine the normal    forces between the particles .",
    "we note that the information required increases considerably as digital , position , interaction complexes are considered , respectively .",
    "our approach is to encode each of these data types into different force networks and one of the goals of this paper is to make clear the difference of the geometric information that can be extracted .",
    "one not particularly surprising conclusion is that the interaction data provides the best information and the digital data the worst , but it is worth quantifying these differences . with this in mind",
    "we begin with several formal definitions .",
    "our focus is on physical systems , thus for the most part we restrict our discussion to two and three dimensional complexes ( see @xcite for a more general discussion ) .",

    "observe that once the pixel data is obtained the actual size used to represent each pixel is no longer an issue .",

    "the actual association depends on the particular characteristics of the imaging device , filtering , thresholding , etc used to obtain and process the data .",
    "conceptually , the most straightforward approach is to discretize the domain of the image into squares , identify the squares with pixels , and declare the pixel to represent a particle if the associated square intersects the particle . a cubical particle network @xmath14 is shown in figure  [ fig : complexes](c ) .",
    "we provide more detail about the construction later .    _ in this paper",

    "as presented , the position complex is an abstract simplicial complex ; that is , there is no specific geometric object associated with it . in the context of this work we can always geometrize the complex by declaring the vertices to be the points @xmath29 , and the edges to be the line segments connecting the points",
    ". from now on we rarely distinguish between the abstract simplicial complex and its geometric realization",
    ".    having defined these complexes , a reasonable first question is whether they correctly capture the topology of the particle configuration .",

    "in fact , independent of the number and arrangement of the particles , the homology of @xmath45 is very simple , @xmath80 thus the betti numbers tell us that @xmath45 has a single connected component and does not have any loops that encircle a void .",

    "to show this , note that @xmath290 is several orders of magnitude larger than @xmath289 , implying that there must be many locations in the network at which the local maxima and minima of the forces change due to introduced error .",
    "we have no theoretical results that explain the relative differences in perturbations of distances between the persistence diagrams associated with the position and digital force networks .",
    "the digital force network was constructed using resolutions of @xmath288 and @xmath291 pixels . given",
    "the size of the domain , each pixel in @xmath288 case represents a measurement to approximately three significant figures .",
    "we hypothesize that this explains the relatively small ( as compared with the position network ) @xmath289 distance .",
    "the @xmath290 distance for truncated data is larger for the digital ( 1000 ) force network than for the position network .",
    "this seems to be connected to a significant drop in the number of @xmath197 generators corresponding to artificial loops ( see figure  [ fig : digitalfailure ] ) in the perturbed digital ( 1000 ) force network .",
    "the original network contains @xmath292 @xmath197 generators while the network obtained by truncation to three significant digits only @xmath293 .",
    "in contrast , the difference between the number of generators for the position networks is @xmath294 .",
    "thus the difference is much smaller and so is the @xmath290 distance .    the sensitivity of digital complexes to small perturbations demonstrated in figure  [ fig : digitalfailure ] suggests that the larger distance value for the @xmath291 digital complex with truncation at three significant digits should not come as a surprise .",
    "the different distance values for different digital complexes raises another issue ; how sensitive is the persistence diagram to the resolution of the digital network ?",
    "we consider this issue using the system shown in figure  [ fig : r00mu00_networks ] .",
    "computing with the original numerical data at a resolution of @xmath286 pixels , we find that the @xmath184 persistence diagrams for the digital networks are almost identical .",
    "comparison of the @xmath197 persistence diagrams reveals that the number of loops is around @xmath295 larger for the higher resolution .",
    "we have verified that this increase is caused by formation of extra loops at the places where the particles are close to each other ; essentially the phenomenon indicated in figure  [ fig : digitalfailure](a ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : r00mu00_networks ] and [ fig : r00mu00_pd ] demonstrate that the digital , position and interaction force networks of a single system of particles can be quite different .",
    "the idea behind the construction of the digital and position force networks is the same , the difference arises from the fact they are based on different complexes that provide different approximations of the geometry of the system of particles .",
    "thus , to focus on the essential differences we mostly restrict our discussion to a comparison of the position and interaction force networks .",

    "the position force network is defined in terms of the vertices and thus the corresponding figures include the magnitude of the force there .",
    "the vertices are not highlighted in the interaction force network since the value of the force on the edges is used to define the values on the vertices .",
    "figures  [ fig : networkdifferences](a ) and ( b ) are typical of a region in which we see crystalline structure or equivalently a region over which there are no defects .",
    "observe that in this crystalline region the normal forces for the position force network are significantly larger than those of the interaction force network .",

    "this is not the case for the @xmath197 persistence diagram of the interaction network .",
    "there is no reason that loops in the position force network can not die , but a possible explanation is as follows .",

    "a similar argument can be made for the interaction network and hence loops that appear in the persistence diagrams must involve multiple edges . if we think of this sequence of edges as a ` force chain ' , then the previous argument suggests that for the position force network this chain is more likely to contain edges of lower magnitude than in the interaction force network . at the same time , we have observed that in crystalline regions the force magnitudes at the particles are larger in the position than in the interaction force network .",
    "these two observations suggest that in the position force network it is difficult to construct a loop in a crystalline region that surrounds vertices with lower forces .",
    "let us now consider briefly the digital force networks .",
    "though not obvious from figure  [ fig : r00mu00_pd ] the @xmath184 persistence diagrams indicate that the digital force network have less points than those for the position or interaction network .",
    "this is due to the fact that , as is discussed in section  [ sec : particle ] , our construction of the digital network artificially inflates area associated with each particle and hence it is possible for distinct components in the position or interaction force network to form a single component in the digital force network .",
    "this effect is particularly relevant in the context of rattlers , the particles that do not experience any force .",

    "we have shown that the information that is available about a granular system influences the detected properties of the force networks .",
    "the interaction force networks , that are based on the information about the forces between interacting particles , provide most precise and reliable information and we concentrate on these networks from now on .",
    "the most direct means of applying persistence diagrams is to use them to distinguish and/or interpret the global force structures of dgm composed of particles characterized by different physical properties .",
    "this approach was followed in our recent work  @xcite , where we considered the number of generators in different parts of the persistence diagrams as the systems that differed by their physical properties were compressed .",
    "here we describe how persistence diagrams can be used to extract a significant amount of information about interaction force networks by considering only two snapshots , at @xmath306 , of the following two systems : a monodisperse frictionless ( @xmath311 ) and a polydisperse frictional ( @xmath312 ) system .",
    "we already know that these two systems behave differently under compression  @xcite , and we use persistence diagrams to illustrate these differences .",
    "the reader should note that the focus here is on illustration of the technique and on interpretation of a limited set of results : more general ( although less detailed ) discussion that concentrates on physical interpretation can be found in  @xcite . in particular , note that the jamming points for these two systems differ , so that by considering the same @xmath249 , we consider two systems which are at different distances from the jamming transition .",
    "we begin by assigning physical meaning to the location of persistence points in the persistence diagrams .",

    "there are at least two different interpretations of the points in the @xmath184 persistence diagram that lie in this region .",
    "the first is to treat these points as noise , i.e.  a byproduct of the imperfect measurements of the normal forces between particles .",

    "this fact leads to the second interpretation , which we adopt , that this region of the persistence diagram provides information about small fluctuations of the forces .",

    "thus this is a symmetric matrix , @xmath332 and @xmath333 ( black ) for all @xmath334 .",
    "figures  [ fig : b](a ) and [ fig : w1](a ) , upper left corners , show that for the first ( @xmath335 ) states considered , the states are similar suggesting that the system is evolving slowly . though less pronounced this is also the case for the last @xmath336 or so states ( bottom right corner ) .",
    "the fact that the upper right corner is yellow indicates that the structure of the forces has evolved over the range of @xmath249 s ( @xmath337 in the considered case ) .",
    "therefore , the persistent homology can be used to capture the evolution of the force networks .",
    "these comments are applicable to both the @xmath289 and @xmath290 distance matrices .",
    "however , the metrics carry different information .",
    "the @xmath289 matrix implies that for the first 17 or last 20 steps there is no single location at which a large change in the force structure occurs .",
    "the corresponding @xmath290 matrix entries , which are approximately 50 times larger , suggests that ( i ) many small changes in the force structure are taking place from step to step , and ( ii ) that from step to step roughly the same number of small changes are occurring . to provide an analogy ; there are ripples on the pond , but the number of ripples are not changing with time .",
    "the abrupt color change ( increase in distance ) at @xmath338 indicates that there has been a significant structural change of the forces of the dgm from state @xmath335 to @xmath339 .",
    "another significant transition can be seen between @xmath340 and @xmath341 .",
    "the evolution in the region between the states @xmath336 and @xmath340 has a similar character . parts with slow evolution are separated by sudden transitions .",
    "the fact that we see these transitions more clearly in the @xmath289 matrix as opposed to the @xmath290 matrix indicates that when significant changes occur , they are localized in space .",
    "conversely , since the two dominant transitions at @xmath335 and @xmath340 are clearly seen in the @xmath290 matrix suggests that they are more global in nature .",
    "the distance matrices for @xmath313 , @xmath255 system are shown in figures  [ fig : b](b ) and [ fig : w1](b ) .",
    "the fact that distances between all the states are small and the relatively broad band of dark blue along the diagonal implies that the evolution of this system is much slower and without any abrupt changes .",
    "this is profoundly different from the behavior of the @xmath259 , @xmath256 system , for the considered range of @xmath249 s .",
    "we give a brief physical interpretation of the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : b ] and  [ fig : w1 ] ; more complete and detailed discussing will be given elsewhere .",
    "the results shown in these figures suggest that at least for the considered narrow range of @xmath249 s , the evolution of @xmath342 system is abrupt , evolving through large scale rearrangements , while the evolution of @xmath343 is comparably smooth .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier results  @xcite , where we show that the @xmath342 system tends to form polycrystalline zones , while the @xmath343 system is much more disordered .",
    "the large distances between the states @xmath344 and @xmath345 shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : b ] and  [ fig : w1 ] are related to breaking up of these polycrystalline zones .",
    "we end this section by directly comparing the two systems .",
    "the entry @xmath329 of the distance matrices shown in figure  [ fig : b](c ) and [ fig : w1](c ) is the @xmath289 and @xmath290 distance , respectively , between the state @xmath330 of the system @xmath259 , @xmath256 and state @xmath331 of the system @xmath313 , @xmath255 .",
    "since the differences between the systems are much larger than differences within a single system , the two systems can be clearly distinguished .",
    "based on different methods for collecting data we have defined three different chain complexes and used them to construct force networks for particulate systems . using the force networks we compute persistence diagrams and discuss how one can use persistent homology to extract information about the geometric structure of the force distributions between the particles .",
    "we provide both theoretical and numerical arguments to show that the persistence diagrams obtained from interaction force networks are the most robust with respect to numerical errors in input data . using numerical data obtained from discrete element simulations of a system of slowly compressed particles ,",
    "we show that the persistence diagrams associated to the different force networks can differ significantly .",
    "this in turn implies that the geometry of the force distributions observed depends upon the methods by which the system is sampled .",
    "we provide some intuition concerning how in general the sampling method affects the geometry .",
    "we also demonstrate that using persistent homology of any of the three force networks allows one to draw meaningful distinctions between the properties of the force distributions of different systems .",
    "these results now provide a solid mathematical background for analysis of the force network in more complex configurations , including systems going through jamming transitions , systems consisting of particles of different shapes , and particulate systems in 3d .",
    "our research in these directions is currently in progress .",
