    "improvements in sensitivity of sub - mm interferometers over the past decade have enabled studies of the molecular gas content at galactic scales to reach very high redshifts . while the first measurements typically targeted highly luminous starbursts ( sbs ) or quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , it is not known whether the star formation efficiency in these giant clumps is similar to that seen in normal galaxy falling on the schmidt - kennicutt relation @xcite , or instead they display shorter time scales for molecular gas consumption .",

    "the four northern clumps ( clump i d 1 to 4 ) coincide with those described in the work of @xcite .",

    "these radii enclose most of the clump fluxes in the optical images , as shown by the white circles in figure  [ fig : udf6462stamps ] .",
    "we also derived intrinsic clumps sizes by fitting with galfit the residual @xmath100-band image with multiple gaussian sources having centres fixed at the clump position .",
    "given its petrosian radius ( see table [ tab : udf6462prop_clump ] ) , we estimate that clump # 3 is unresolved at the @xmath47-band resolution and hence treat it as a point source for the rest of the paper .    to estimate the stellar mass and star - formation rates of the clumps we followed a number of approaches , an in - depth discussion of these methods is given in appendix [ app : clumpmeasurements ] .",
    "briefly , the techniques we explored differ in terms of how the clump sed fitting is performed ( integrated clump photometry vs. pixel - by - pixel from resolved maps ) , how star formation rate is modelled / traced ( uv luminosity vs. csf templates ) and whether or not a contribution for a galactic diffuse component is subtracted . as evident in figure  [ fig : clumpssfr ] , the derivation of the clump physical parameters is affected by systematics that depend on all these assumptions .",
    "while these systematics are less important for stellar masses , which typically agree within a factor of 2 - 3 for each individual clump , sfr values can differ by a factor @xmath010 in some of the clumps .",
    "we adopt the average of the different measurements for each clump as our preferred estimate for its mass and sfr but , to stress that these can be subject to large uncertainties , we will show the full range of possible values as error bars in our plots .",
