    "the cross sections for heavy quark production in hadron - hadron and lepton - hadron collisions at high energies are strongly dependent on the behavior of the gluon distribution , which is determined by the underlying qcd dynamics ( see e.g. refs .",
    "theoretically , at high energies the qcd evolution leads to a system with high gluon density , characterized by the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wavefunction ( parton saturation ) .",
    "the transition is specified by a typical scale , which is energy dependent and is called saturation scale @xmath0 ( for recent reviews see ref .",
    "signals of parton saturation have already been observed both in @xmath1 deep inelastic scattering at hera and in deuteron - gold collisions at rhic ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite we demonstrated that the inclusive charm total cross section exhibits the property of geometric scaling , which is one of the main characteristics of the high density approaches .",
    "however , the observation of this new regime still needs confirmation and so there is an active search for new experimental signatures . in this paper",
    "we study the inclusive and diffractive photoproduction of heavy quarks in proton - proton collisions considering three phenomenological models based on the color glass condensate , which describe quite well the current experimental hera data for inclusive and exclusive observables .",
    "our goal is twofold : update our previous studies @xcite considering these new parameterizations for the dipole scattering amplitude and present a comparison between the inclusive and diffractive production mechanisms using an identical theoretical input .",
    "our main motivation comes from the fact that in coherent interactions at tevatron and lhc the photon reaches energies higher than those currently accessible at desy - hera . in hadron - hadron colliders ,",
    "the relativistic protons give rise to strong electromagnetic fields , which can interact with each other .",
    "namely , quasi - real photons scatters off protons at very high energies in the current hadron colliders ( for recent reviews on coherent interactions see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the heavy quark photoproduction cross section in a proton - proton collision is given by , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the photon energy in the center - of - mass frame ( c.m.s . ) , @xmath4 is the c.m.s .",

    "the final state @xmath6 can be a hadronic state generated by the fragmentation of one of the colliding protons ( inclusive production ) or a proton ( diffractive production ) .",
    "the photon spectrum is given by @xcite , @xmath7 \\left ( \\ln{\\omega } - \\frac{11}{6 } + \\frac{3}{\\omega }   - \\frac{3}{2 \\,\\omega^2 } + \\frac{1}{3 \\,\\omega^3 } \\right ) \\",

    "the expression above is derived considering the weizscker - williams method of virtual photons and using an elastic proton form factor ( for more detail see refs .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the expression ( [ eq : photon_spectrum ] ) is based on a heuristic approximation , which leads to an overestimation of the cross section at high energies ( @xmath11 at @xmath12 tev ) in comparison with the more rigorous derivation of the photon spectrum for elastic scattering on protons derived in ref .",
    "for a more detailed comparison among the different photon spectra see ref .",
    "@xcite . as a photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding protons can interact with one photon of the other proton ( two - photon process ) or can interact directly with the other proton ( photon - hadron process ) , both possibilities has been studied in the literature . in principle , the experimental signature of these two processes is distinct and it can easily be separated .",
    "while in two - photon interactions we expect the presence of two rapidities gaps and no hadron breakup , in the inclusive heavy quark photon - hadron production the hadron target we expect only one rapidity gap and the dissociation of the hadron . however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the diffractive heavy quark photoproduction , where we also expect the presence of two rapidity gaps in the final state , similarly to two - photon interactions , is an important background for two - photon interactions as well as for the dedicated program to search evidence of the higgs and/or new physics in central double diffractive production processes @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we briefly review the description of the inclusive and diffractive photoproduction of heavy quarks within the dipole picture and the distinct phenomenological saturation models which will be used in our calculations ( section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "our results are compared with the desy - hera data @xcite and the predictions from the bcgc and ip - sat models for this process are presented for the first time . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "the numerical results for the rapidity @xmath13 of the produced states and their total cross sections are shown .",
    "a comparison on the order of magnitude of the cross sections for the distinct models is performed .",
    "finally in section [ sec4 ] we present our main conclusions .",
    "the photon - hadron interaction at high energy ( small @xmath14 ) is usually described in the infinite momentum frame of the hadron in terms of the scattering of the photon off a sea quark , which is typically emitted by the small-@xmath14 gluons in the proton . however , in order to describe inclusive and diffractive interactions and disentangle the small-@xmath14 dynamics of the hadron wavefunction , it is more adequate to consider the photon - hadron scattering in the dipole frame , in which most of the energy is carried by the hadron , while the photon has just enough energy to dissociate into a quark - antiquark pair before the scattering . in this representation",
    "the probing projectile fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair ( a dipole ) with transverse separation @xmath15 long after the interaction , which then scatters off the target @xcite .",
    "the main motivation to use this color dipole approach , is that it gives a simple unified picture of inclusive and diffractive processes . in particular , in this approach the inclusive heavy quark photoproduction cross section @xmath16 $ ] reads as , @xmath17 furthermore , the diffractive cross section for the process @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 in the eqs .",

    "it can be obtained by solving the bk ( jimwlk ) evolution equation in the rapidity @xmath28 .",
    "many groups have studied the numerical solution of the bk equation , but several improvements are still necessary before using the solution in the calculation of observables . in particular",
    ", one needs to include the next - to - leading order corrections into the evolution equation and perform a global analysis of all small @xmath14 data .",
    "it is a program in progress ( for recent results see @xcite ) . in the meantime",
    "it is necessary to use phenomenological models for @xmath29 which capture the most essential properties of the solution .    during the last years an intense activity in the area resulted in sophisticated models for the dipole - proton scattering amplitude , which have strong theoretical constraints and which are able to describe the hera and/or rhic data @xcite .",

    "one have that the iim and bcgc models underestimate the experimental data for charm production at high energies , producing a reasonable description of the region near threshold ( low energies : @xmath83 gev ) .",
    "in contrast , the ip - sat model describes the high energy region but overestimate the low energy regime . for the bottom case , the value of @xmath14 which determines the magnitude of the saturation scale is not sufficiently small , which implies that the cross section is dominated by the linear regime of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the three models give a reasonable description of the scarce experimental data .",
    "unfortunately , the current precision and statistics of the experimental measurements of the photoproduction cross section are either low to formulate definitive conclusions about the robustness of the different saturation models presented here .",
    "more precise measurements could be pose stringent constraints on the energy dependence and overall normalization .",
    "finally , it should be noticed that the present calculations concern only the direct photon contribution to the cross section , whereas the resolved component has been neglected . in some extent the results from the saturation models presented here",

    "it implies that the experimental study of these observables can be useful to determine the qcd dynamics at high energies .",
    "in what follows , we will compute the rapidity distribution and total cross sections for the inclusive and diffractive photoproduction of heavy quarks from proton - proton collisions at high energies .",

    "therefore , these reactions can have high rates at the lhc kinematical regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross sections for diffractive production are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the inclusive case , but due the clear experimental signature of this process ( two rapidity gaps ) , its experimental analyzes still is feasible .    in comparison with our previous results for the inclusive production of heavy quarks",
    "@xcite we have that our predictions using the modern phenomenological iim and bcgc models are similar .",
    "however , the ip - sat prediction is factor of @xmath96 2 larger . in the diffractive case ,",
    "our predictions are larger by a factor @xmath97 2 than those presented in @xcite , where we have used the gbw model @xcite as input in our calculations .",
    "this behavior is directly associated to the different energy dependence predicted by the models for the linear regime .",
    "furthermore , in comparison with the predictions for the heavy quark hadroproduction ( see e.g. @xcite ) , photoproduction cross sections are smaller ( @xmath98 1% ) .",
    "however , the experimental separation between these two mechanics is feasible due to the presence of one rapidity gap in the photoproduction process .",
    "lets now calculate the production rates for charm and bottom production in coherent interactions . at tevatron , assuming the design luminosity @xmath99 cm@xmath54s@xmath101 , we have for inclusive production of charm @xmath102 and for bottom @xmath103 events / second . in the diffractive case , we predict 7 - 22 ( @xmath104 ) events / second for charm ( bottom ) production . at lhc ,",

    "notice the large rate for bottom at lhc .",
    "finally , lets discuss the experimental separation of the inclusive and diffractive photoproduction of heavy quarks . as emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite , although the inclusive photoproduction cross section to be a small fraction of the hadronic cross section , the separation of this channel is feasible if we impose the presence of a rapidity gap in the final state .",
    "it occurs due to the proton which is the photon emitter remains intact in the process .",
    "we expect that a cut in the transverse momentum of the pair could eliminate most part of the contribution associated to the hadroproduction of heavy quarks . moreover , in comparison with the hadroproduction of heavy quarks , the event multiplicity for photoproduction interactions is lower , which implies that it may be used as a separation factor between these processes . in the case of diffractive photoproduction of heavy quarks",
    "we expect the presence of two rapidity gaps in the final state , similarly to two - photon or pomeron - pomeron interactions .",
    "consequently , it is important to determine the magnitude of this cross section in order to estimate the background for these other channels . in particular , the central exclusive diffraction ( ced ) process characterized by the production of a final state via fusion of two pomerons has being intensely studied as an alternative process to search evidence of the higgs and/or new physics @xcite , with the main background being the exclusive @xmath109 production . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the double diffractive ( dd ) heavy quark production is studied using the diffractive factorization theorem , including absorption corrections .",
    "the magnitude of the cross section is the following : for tevatron one has @xmath110 @xmath111b and @xmath112 @xmath111b , whereas for the lhc one obtains @xmath113 @xmath111b and @xmath114 @xmath111b .",
    "it is expected that emerging protons from ced and dd processes have a much larger transverse momentum than those resulting from diffractive photoproduction processes .",
    "consequently , in principle it is possible to introduce a selection criteria to separate these two processes .",
    "however , this subject deserves more detailed studies .",
    "in summary , we have computed the cross sections for inclusive and diffractive photoproduction of heavy quarks in @xmath84 and @xmath78 collisions at tevatron and lhc energies , respectively . this has been performed using modern phenomenological models based on the color glass condensate formalism , which describe quite well the inclusive and exclusive observables measured in @xmath1 collisions at hera .",
    "the obtained values are shown to be sizeable at tevatron and are increasingly larger at lhc .",
    "the feasibility of detection of these reactions is encouraging , since their experimental signature should be suitably clear .",
    "furthermore , they enable to constrain the underlying qcd dynamics at high energies , which is fundamental to predict the observables which will be measured in central hadron - hadron collisions at lhc .",
