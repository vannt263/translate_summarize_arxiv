    "when studying the x - ray populations of external galaxies , globular cluster x - ray sources are of particular interest , because they are most probably low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , rather than e.g. background galaxies , supernova remnants , or high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .",
    "globular clusters contain @xmath010% of the galactic lmxb population ( 14 out of @xmath0150 ) , but are thought to contain only 0.1% of the mass , hence the lmxb density is @xmath0100 times higher in gcs than elsewhere ( see the comprehensive review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) ; indeed , it has been speculated that all lmxbs were born in globular clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "m31 is the nearest neighboring spiral galaxy , at @xmath0780 kpc @xcite , and is a favored target of many x - ray telescopes .",
    "hence , its gc x - ray sources have been particularly well studied .",
    "x - ray surveys of m31 include those made with einstein @xcite , rosat @xcite , xmm - newton @xcite , and chandra @xcite .",
    "@xcite conducted a gc survey of m31 with chandra , covering @xmath02560 arcmin@xmath6 .",
    "they found 30 gc x - ray sources , 15 of which were new discoveries .",
    "they found that the m31 gc x - ray population was systematically more luminous than the milky way ( mw ) population ; 10 m31 gc x - ray sources in their survey exceeded 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath3 , vs. 1 of the 11 mw gc x - ray sources surveyed by rosat @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite conducted a survey of x - ray sources in the 2xmmi catalog @xcite that included all publicly available xmm - newton observations of m31 , searching for associations with gcs ; the observations cover @xmath080% of the gcs in m31 .",
    "they found 41 gc associations in the 2xmmi catalogue , and 4 transient x - ray sources observed by either rosat or chandra , for a total of 45 gc lmxbs .",
    "we have been monitoring the central region of m31 with chandra for the last @xmath012 years , averaging @xmath01 observation per month , looking for x - ray transients ; we exclude periods where m31 is too close to the sun to be observed .",
    "these observations have no fixed roll angle , and the combined field may be approximated by a circle with a @xmath020@xmath8 radius .",
    "the earlier chandra surveys included long - term variability studies : @xcite found 204 x - ray sources in the central 17@xmath9 region , detecting variability in @xmath050% of the sources over 8 acis - i observations between 1999 , october and 2001 , june ; @xcite examined 2.5 years of hrc data , and found at least 25% of 166 sources to be significantly variable .    in this work we present a variability survey of all x - ray sources in our chandra observations that are associated with objects in the revised bologna catalog of m31 globular clusters ( rbc v.4 , * ? ? ?",

    "this includes 30 out of 45 gc x - ray sources identified by @xcite ; the other 7 rbc associations in our survey include 4 gc candidates , 2 background galaxies ( agn ) , and 1 star .",
    "we compare the variability of these x - ray sources with the ensemble variability for active galaxies found by @xcite .    it has long been known that agn may vary by a factor of a 23 on time - scales of months to years , with the amplitude of variation inversely proportional to the luminosity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "however , it has been known for exceptional agn to flare up by an order of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite studied the ensemble variability over time - scales of hours to years of agn in the serendipitous source catalogs from xmm - newton @xcite and swift @xcite ; their sample covered redshifts @xmath00.24.5 , and 0.54.5 kev luminosities @xmath010@xmath1010@xmath11 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "they included 412 agn from the xmm - newton catalog , and 27 agn from the swift catalog ; all of these agn were sampled at least twice .",
    "they used a structure function ( sf ) to estimate the mean intensity deviation for data separated by time @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the photon noise and @xmath15 is the x - ray flux .",
    "they grouped the sf into logarithmic bins with width 0.5 ; each bin in the range log(@xmath12 ) = 1.03.0 contained more than 100 measurements .",
    "@xcite found that sf increased from @xmath00.1 to @xmath00.2 as @xmath12 ranged over 0.11000 days in the rest frame of the agn .",
    "sf @xmath0 0.15 for @xmath12 = 30 days , suggesting that typical agn would vary by @xmath02575% between our observations .",
    "they also investigated the well - observed anti - correlation between intensity variability ( @xmath16 ) and luminosity , expressed in the form @xmath17 ; @xmath18 @xmath00.3 in the literature for time - scales of days to tens of days .",
    "they measured @xmath18 for agn grouped logarithmically over log @xmath19 = 43.545.5 for two values of @xmath12 : 1 day and 100 days .",
    "they find @xmath18 = 0.42@xmath200.03 for @xmath12 = 1 day , and @xmath18 = 0.21@xmath200.07 for @xmath12 = 100 days .",
    "@xcite measured the average values of @xmath21 for the xmm - newton and swift samples to be 0.031 and 0.163 respectively .",
    "when they used these values to calculate the sfs for each sample , the two sfs were consistent ; if sf(@xmath12 ) @xmath22 @xmath23 , then @xmath24 = 0.10@xmath200.01 for the xmm - newton sf , and @xmath24 = 0.07@xmath200.04 for the swift sf .",
    "we have created structure functions for each of our targets from their 0.54.5 lightcurves . the goal was to ascertain whether we may distinguish between xbs and agn from their variability alone ; this is important because xb and agn often exhibit similar spectra .",
    "our analysis of the full data set has allowed us to identify seven black hole candidates associated with globular clusters ; four were previously published @xcite , and three are new to this work .",
    "we identified one more gc black hole candidate in this region in earlier work @xcite , and one away from the bulge @xcite .",
    "they were all identified from their x - ray properties , as they exhibited characteristic low state emission spectra at luminosities that exceeded the limit for a neutron star accretor ; other neutron star emission models were rejected ( see * ? ? ? * for the most complete justification of this method ) .",
    "we describe the data analysis in the next section , followed by a presentation of our results , then a discussion of our findings and conclusions .",
    "we have analyzed 89 acis observations and 45 hrc observations , in order to discern the variability of x - ray sources associated with gcs in this region .",
    "the merged acis image was registered to the field 5 b band image from the local group galaxy survey observations of m31 @xcite with iraf software , using 27 x - ray bright gcs .",
    "after refining the gc positions in the chandra and lgs b band images with imcentroid , we found the sky co - ordinates of the new positions with xy2sky , then registered the x - ray positions to the lgs b band image using ccmap .",
    "the mean r.m.s .",
    "uncertainty in position due to registration was 0.11@xmath25 in r.a . and 0.09@xmath25 in dec .",
    "we obtained 0.37.0 kev lightcurves and spectra from circular source and background regions for each source .",
    "the background region was the same size as the source region , and at a similar off - axis angle .",
    "the extraction radius varied between sources , because larger off - axis angles resulted in larger point spread functions .    for acis observations , we obtained corresponding response matrices and ancillary response files .",
    "source spectra with @xmath26200 net source counts were freely fitted with absorbed power law models .",
    "for gcs with multiple freely fitted spectra , we obtained the best fit constant values for absorption ( @xmath27 ) and photon index ( @xmath28 ) . for observations with @xmath5200 net source photons , we fixed @xmath27 and @xmath28 to the best fit values ; if a particular gc had no freely fitted spectra , then we assumed @xmath27 = 7@xmath29 h atom @xmath30 , and @xmath28 = 1.7 .",
    "we obtained luminosities for faint sources by determining the unabsorbed 0.310 kev luminosity equivalent to 1 count s@xmath3 ; multiplying the source intensity by this conversion factor gave the source luminosity , after correcting for the exposure , vignetting and background .    for hrc observations",
    ", we included only pi channels 48293 , thereby reducing the instrumental background .",
    "we used the webpimms tool to find the unabsorbed luminosity equivalent to 1 count s@xmath3 , assuming the same emission model as for the acis observations with @xmath5200 photons .",
    "we created a 1 kev exposure map for each observation , and compared the exposure within the source region with that of an identical on - axis region , in order to estimate the necessary exposure correction .",
    "we multiplied the background subtracted , corrected source intensity by the conversion to get the 0.310 kev luminosity .",
    "we created long term 0.310 kev lightcurves for each source , using the luminosities obtained from each observation as described above .",
    "we only included observations with net source counts @xmath31 0 after background subtraction .",
    "we fitted each long term lightcurve with a line of constant intensity , in order to ascertain the source variability .",
    "if the null hypothesis probability for the best fit to a lightcurve was @xmath50.003 , then the variability of that lightcurve had a significance @xmath263@xmath32 , and we classified the target as variable ; the null hypothesis probability determines the likelihood that observed deviations from the model are due to random fluctuations in the data .",
    "luminosity uncertainties for freely fitted spectra were estimated with xspec by calculating a range of fluxes obtained by varying the emission parameters ; the uncertainties for the faint spectra are derived directly from intensity uncertainties using the relevant fixed model .",
    "we derived sfs from the 0.54.5 kev fluxes of each observation of every target by assuming a power law spectrum with the same photon index as for the hrc and faint acis observations ; an m31 x - ray source with a 0.310 kev unabsorbed luminosity of 1.0@xmath33 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath28 = 1.7 has a 0.54.5 kev flux of 0.8@xmath34 erg @xmath30 s@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite calculated the noise component from @xmath35 assuming that @xmath36 = @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the number of photons .",
    "our lightcurves are background subtracted , and arf - corrected ; furthermore , uncertainties in the luminosities of bright sources include uncertainties in the spectral parameters . as a result ,",
    "our uncertainties are not simply due to photon counting noise . hence in our case , @xmath39 ^ 2 + \\left [ \\frac{\\delta f_{\\rm x}\\left(t\\right)}{f_{\\rm x}\\left(t\\right ) } \\right]^2\\right>.\\ ] ]",
    "the merged observations cover an approximately circular region with 20@xmath8 radius .",
    "we detected 430 x - ray sources in this region , and found 428 globular clusters from the rbc .",
    "therefore we expect chance coincidences of x - ray sources within 1@xmath25 of the gc centers for 0.12 out of 428 gcs .",
    "shifting the declination of each source by @xmath205@xmath25 resulted in no coincidences within 1@xmath25 of a rbc object ; shifting the ra by @xmath405@xmath25 also resulted in no coincidences ; however , shifting the ra by + 5@xmath25 resulted in two matches within 1@xmath25 of a rbc object . expanding",
    "the search radius from 1@xmath25 to 2@xmath25 provided one additional match each for offsets @xmath205@xmath25 in declination .",
    "hence we expect 02 false matches .",
    "we found 37 x - ray sources to be coincident with m31 gcs , as classified by the rbc .",
    "x - ray positional uncertainties include uncertainties in the centroid on the x - ray image , uncertainties in the registration ( 0.11@xmath25 for ra , and 0.09@xmath25 for dec ) , and 0.25@xmath25 uncertainty in the lgs position .    in table",
    "[ opticalprops ] we present the positions and identifications of each x - ray source that we associate with a member of the rbc v4 .",
    "we provide the latest classifications of the optical counterparts , gleaned from @xcite ; our sample includes 1 star , and 2 galaxies , as well as 30 confirmed old gcs and 4 gc candidates .",
    "we also show the distance between the x - ray source and its optical counterpart , and the uncertainties in ra and dec ; x - ray sources with no good centroid solution are indicated by `` @xmath41 '' .",
    "eight of our targets are far off - axis ( @xmath01120@xmath8 ) and also x - ray faint .",

    "we then show the line of sight absorption and photon index used for the model used to convert from intensity to luminosity for all hrc observations , and for acis observations with @xmath5200 net source photons .",
    "we finally give the best fit 0.310 kev unabsorbed luminosity and @xmath44/dof for the best fit line of constant intensity .",
    "the lightcurves of the variable sources are presented in fig .",
    "[ gclcs ] ; the complete version of this figure is available in the electronic version .",
    "we found significant x - ray variability in 28 of the 34 gcs and gc candidates ; the remaining 6 sources had 0.310 kev luminosities @xmath452@xmath46 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the two agn in our survey , b042d and b044d were rather faint ( @xmath47 erg s@xmath3 ) , but both exhibited variability at at @xmath48 significance .    in fig .",
    "[ sfh ] we present a histogram showing the number of pairs of observation with a given separation @xmath12 for xb144 , the target with the most observations .",
    "the histogram is binned logarithmically , with a width of 0.2 .",
    "each bin averages tens or hundreds of observation pairs .",
    "we note that sf(@xmath12 ) becomes imaginary if the observed variability is smaller than the noise .",
    "such behavior manifests as sf(@xmath12 ) = 0 .",
    "both agn have mostly imaginary sfs ; however , both show significant variability over times - scales of a few thousand days ; this variability is consistent with the ensemble agn sf created by @xcite .",
    "the sfs of the brightest x - ray binaries ( 0.310 kev luminosity @xmath495@xmath33 erg s@xmath3 ) are also generally consistent with the ensemble agn sf , or even less variable , despite the relatively high signal to noise .",
    "this result is in keeping with the observed behavior of galactic x - ray binaries ; @xcite showed that the brightest x - ray binaries ( i.e. z - sources ) vary by a factor of a few , while the fainter binaries ( atoll sources ) can vary by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude . however , these bright x - ray sources have 210 kev fluxes greater than nearly all agn ; the 210 kev log n - log s plot for agn calculated by @xcite leads us to expect @xmath51 agn per square degree with comparable fluxes .",
    "our most encouraging result is that most of the fainter x - ray sources have sfs showing substantially more variability than the ensemble agn sf over most time - scales .",
    "this is an important distinction to make , since x - ray binary and agn emission spectra are often very similar .    unlike the other bright x - ray sources , the sf for xb158 shows considerably more variability than the ensemble agn sf over all time - scales .",
    "xb158 is a high inclination x - ray binary that exhibits periodic intensity dips on a @xmath010,000 s period@xcite and also disc precession @xcite ; it is further discussed in section  [ b158 ] .",
    "we have previously identified six black hole candidates ( bhcs ) in the observed region , based on their exhibition of characteristic low state emission spectra at luminosities that are too high for neutron star systems @xcite .",
    "five of these systems are associated with gcs , and four of those are persistently bright , which is unexpected given that much of the theoretical work to date models these systems as transients ( see * ? ? ? * for an overview of the literature on the topic of black holes in globular clusters ) .",
    "low state emission spectra are characterized by a dominant power law component with @xmath28 @xmath52 , contributing @xmath4990% of the flux @xcite , and are seen in all low mass x - ray binaries , whether they contain black holes or neutron stars @xcite .",
    "however , it has become apparent that the low state is confined to luminosities @xmath4510% eddington @xcite .",
    "hence x - ray binaries that exhibit low state spectra at luminosities significantly higher than 3@xmath33 erg s@xmath3 are likely to contain black hole accretors .    however , a good fit with @xmath28 @xmath52 is not sufficient by itself to identify a bhc ; we must first reject competing emission models .",
    "in particular , we must reject a disk blackbody - dominated spectrum ( representing the thermally dominated black hole state ) , a blackbody + power law model that represents high luminosity emission in neutron star xbs , and a disk blackbody + steep power law ( @xmath28 @xmath262.4 ) model to represent the bh steep power law state .",
    "the terzan-5 x - ray transient igrj17480@xmath402446 exhibited an unusually impressive range of properties : z - source and atoll behavior , as well as thermonuclear x - ray bursts and 11 hz pulsations ; @xcite conducted detailed spectral analysis of the outburst , using data from @xmath040 @xmath0daily rxte observations .",
    "they found that the spectra were all well described by a simple emission model ( blackbody + power law + gaussian emission line ) . the blackbody component contributed @xmath03050% of the 315 kev flux , with k@xmath50 = 1.42.1 kev for the most part and 3.7 kev for the first observation ; @xmath28 @xmath02.13.0 ; the unabsorbed 315 kev flux was 2.5817.94@xmath51 erg @xmath30 s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we estimated the unabsorbed luminosity and blackbody contribution to each spectra in the 0.310 kev band for igrj17480@xmath402446 , from the best fit parameters , and assuming a distance of 5.5 kpc .",
    "we assumed that the power law component extended down to 0.3 kev ; alternative models where the seed photon energy for the comptonized component matched the inner disk temperature were rejected by the xmm - newton spectrum of our m31 black hole candidate rx j0042.3 + 4115 in the steep power law state @xcite .",
    "we found that the blackbody contributed 713% of the unabsorbed 0.310 kev luminosity of 1.833@xmath110@xmath7 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "igrj17480@xmath402446 appears not to have been in the low state at any time during the outburst .",
    "we note that @xcite devised an alternative model to describe two other neutron star x - ray transients , aql x-1 , and 4u1608@xmath4052 ; traditional emission models ( thermal + inverse - comptonized emission ) all yielded good fits for spectra with @xmath2610@xmath52 net source counts , but the authors raised objections to various aspects of the spectral evolution of the transient outbursts .",
    "they preferred a disk blackbody + blackbody emission model at high luminosities , with a comptonized component necessary at lower luminosities .",
    "in this scenario , the neutron star transient evolution closely follows black hole transient evolution , with an extra blackbody component from either the neutron star itself or the boundary layer between the disc and neutron star surface .",
    "however , their model contradicts a large body of work based on observations of galactic neutron star xbs .",
    "plenty of evidence exists for an extended x - ray emission region in the high inclination , `` dipping '' x - ray binaries ( radius @xmath020,000700,000 obtained from ingress of photo - electric absorption dips ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "furthermore , broadened emission lines in chandra observations of cygnus x-2 suggest a hot , dense corona of up to @xmath0100,000 km @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we applied the double - thermal emission model to our bhc spectra for completeness ; the comptonized component should not be required at such high x - ray luminosities according to @xcite .",
    "we examined the lightcurves and spectral histories of all our targets , searching for further bhcs .",
    "we found a total of 8 gc lmxbs that apparently exhibited high luminosity low states ; we refer to the x - ray source associated with gc labeled in the rbc v4 as b@xmath53 as xb@xmath53 .",

    "these results are supportive of the classification of xb148 as a black hole candidate . assuming a power law model yields @xmath27 = 1.5@xmath200.4@xmath58 atom @xmath30 , giving an unabsorbed 0.310 kev luminosity of 4.7@xmath200.5@xmath33 erg s@xmath3",

    "we list these properties in table  [ gcprops ] .    in @xcite",
    "we concluded that particularly massive or metal rich gcs could contain bright x - ray sources ( and hence bhcs ) as well as those gcs that are both massive and metal rich .",

    "we note that the low metallicity for b135 is in keeping with the high inferred bh mass for xb135 ; @xcite have shown that while bh masses are limited to @xmath015 m@xmath64 for solar metalicities , they could theoretically reach @xmath086 @xmath62 for metallicities @xmath01% solar .",
    "xb158 ( a.k.a .",
    "bo 158 ) is a high inclination xb that experiences periodic intensity dips on the orbital period @xcite ; the original study used lightcurves folded on the 10017 s ( 2.8 hr ) period , and @xcite concluded that the dip depth varied with luminosity .",
    "however , detailed analysis of the original xmm - newton observations , along with proprietary observations , revealed that the dips appeared in some observations , but not in others @xcite .",
    "this behaviour occurs in systems with low mass ratios ( short periods ) because the outer edge of the accretion disc reaches the 3:1 resonance , causing additional tidal torques from the secondary that lead to elongation and precession of the disc ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "xb158 is located at a high off - axis angle from the focus of the observations , and was only observed in 19 acis observations ; it was observed in all of the hrc observations thanks to the larger field of view .",
    "the 0.310 kev luminosity was extremely variable , ranging over @xmath0440@xmath33 erg s@xmath3 , with the best fit line of constant intensity yielding @xmath44/dof = 3030/63 for acis and hrc observations .",
    "we note that the high quality xmm - newton spectra of xb158 require a two component emission model consisting of e.g. a black body + power law @xcite , however , the chandra spectra were well described by a power law with best fit constant @xmath28 = 0.59@xmath200.17 .",
    "we propose that the observed fluctuation between high and low luminosities may be caused by varying accretion rates over the disc precession cycle .",
    "using proprietary three dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics code , we estimated the disc precession period to be @xmath029 orbital periods , or @xmath081 hours @xcite .",
    "the cadence of these observations is not well suited for testing such a period , however the similar minima and maxima are suggestive of some sort of super - orbital cycle .",
    "we note that the hrc luminosities for xb158 may be misleading , since we are approximating a two - component spectrum with a single power law , and the hrc responses to each component may be different from the acis responses .",
    "however , it is encouraging to see that acis and hrc observations made at similar times produced consistent luminosities . even if the normalization of the hrc lightcurve is incorrect , the variability reflects the intensity variation of the source , suggesting that the luminosity of xb158 really is rapidly , and systematically variable .",
    "we may expect gc xbs to have systematically shorter periods than xbs outside gcs because the probability of collisions with other stars in the gc is high , and these interactions shorten the orbital periods .",
    "hence , even binaries with mass ratios @xmath260.3 may have sufficiently short periods to experience the tidal resonances that produce precessing discs .",
    "the 0.310 kev lightcurve of xb146 looks similar to that of xb158 , in that it also fluctuates between fairly consistent minima and maxima ; however , it is observed in 131 out of 134 observations , and appears to be more structured .",
    "the best fit line of constant intensity yields @xmath44/dof = 3614/130 , as the 0.310 kev luminosity fluctuates between @xmath65 and @xmath05@xmath66 erg s@xmath3 , with the occasional outlier .",
    "we therefore suggest that xb146 , and other x - ray sources exhibiting similar behavior are xbs with precessing accretion discs .",
    "unfortunately , this is not easily verified unless they are viewed close to edge on .",
    "four x - ray sources in our sample are considered transient , in that they vary in 0.310 kev luminosity by a factor @xmath26100 between observations where they are detected , and are fainter than the detection limit in other observations .",
    "two types of xb behaviour leads to transient x - ray sources .",
    "lmxbs may exhibit transient behaviour due to instabilities in the disc ; the discs accumulate matter during a long quiescent phase , and burn a large portion of the accreted material during outbursts . long period hmxbs with eccentric orbits may also be x - ray transients , if accretion occurs only in a limited phase range near periastron .",
    "three of the transients are associated with a gc or candidate and are expected to be lmxbs due to the ages of the gc populations ; this includes xb163 , which we have identified as a black hole candidate , as previously discussed .",
    "xb128 varied by a factor @xmath26500 over 47 observations , peaking at a 0.310 kev luminosity @xmath05@xmath33 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the best spectrum for xb128 was from chandra observation 4682 ( 2004 may 23 ) , yielding 157 net source counts ; it was well described by a power law with @xmath28=1.5@xmath67 , a disk blackbody with k@xmath50 = 1.6@xmath68 kev , or a two component model consisting of a @xmath01 kev blackbody and a power law with @xmath28 @xmath02 ; this spectrum is consistent with a neutron star or black hole primary .",
    "xpb - in7 varied by a factor @xmath26100 over 103 observations .",
    "the peak luminosity of xpb - in7 was in chandra observation 8183 ( 2007 january 14 ) , with 227 net counts ; however , we were unable to obtain an acceptable fit from any of our spectral models .",
    "since the peak luminosity was only 1.7@xmath33 erg s@xmath3 , we would be unable to determine the nature of the accretor in any case .",
    "we note that pb - in7 is only a gc candidate , and further insight into the nature of the host may help interpret the nature of xpb - in7 .",
    "xsk059a is coincident with likely compact gc , in a region rich in hii ( caldwell , private communication ) . as such",
    ", it may be a hmxb associated with the hii instead of a lmxb associated with the gc .",
    "xsk059a varied by a factor @xmath0300 between chandra observations , exhibiting long quiescent intervals punctuated with many outbursts .",
    "the lightcurve is consistent with 8 outbursts @xmath4910@xmath7 erg s@xmath3 separated by 16 cycles of @xmath0120 days , with the outbursts lasting up to @xmath090 days ; we indicate these bursts in fig .",
    "1 with downward arrows .",
    "however , these outbursts are not present in every cycle .",
    "such behaviour may be explained by a hmxb with variable mass loss rate from the secondary .",
    "we have analyzed the long term lightcurves of globular cluster x - ray sources using 134 chandra observations taken over @xmath012 years ; these x - ray sources are likely lmxbs .",
    "our sample was drawn from the revised bologna catalogue v. 4 , and included 30 confirmed old globular clusters , 4 candidate globular clusters , 2 background galaxies , and 1 star . fitting each lightcurve with a line of constant luminosity revealed that 30 out 37 targets were variable ; the other 7 targets had 0.310 kev luminosities @xmath452@xmath46 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "we infer from these results that all xbs in our field with 0.310 kev luminosities @xmath69 erg s@xmath3 should be variable also .",
    "we created structure functions from the 0.54.5 kev fluxes of our variable sources , for comparison with the ensemble agn sf created by @xcite .",
    "the lower luminosity xbs exhibited sfs that generally showed substantially more variability than the agn sf over most time - scales .",
    "the higher luminosity xbs had sfs generally indicating similar , or lesser , variability than the ensemble agn sf ; however , the 210 kev fluxes for these systems were higher than almost all agn .",
    "this discrimination is important , since the emission spectra of xbs and agn are often similar .",

    "we have identified apparent super - orbital variability in xb158 , which is a high inclination system where the disk is known to precess .",
