    "entanglement is one of the most fundamental tool for future quantum technologies @xcite",
    ". many applications of entanglement like teleportation , quantum cryptography , quantum games , quantum imaging , etc . have been investigated @xcite .",
    "all these applications need maximally entangled states for perfect execution of quantum information . but quantum states are too evasive such that they may loose their entanglement , when interact with external environment .",
    "so dynamics of entanglement under various environmental interactions in different quantum states plays an important role to process the quantum information . for the dimension @xmath0 ,",
    "the quantum states have been divided into two categories such as free entangled and bound entangled states @xcite .",
    "free entangled states are distillable states and can be effectively utilized for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it is known that all the quantum states in @xmath1 and @xmath2 dimensions are distillable . while on the other hand the bound entangled states are noisy states and hard to distill .",
    "so these are difficult to use for practical quantum information processing .",
    "however these states activate the teleportation fidelity @xcite .",
    "recently , the bound entanglement have been realized experimentally in quantum information processing @xcite . at present",
    "there are many mathematical tools available to characterize and detect the entanglement for bipartite systems in @xmath3 and @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "negativity is one of these and is good measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "but for the dimensions @xmath0 , the characterization and detection of entanglement is still an open problem .",
    "various criteria have been given to detect the bound entanglement such as realignment criteria , cross norm realignment criteria , etc .",
    "for higher dimensions @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the entanglement dynamics of two qubit pair under dm interaction @xcite , by taking an third controller qubit , has been studied by zheng qiang _ et al .",
    "the third controller qubit interact with the qubit of the pair through dm interaction .",
    "they have shown that by adjusting the state ( i.e. probability amplitude ) of either environmental qubit or qutrit and dm interaction strength , one can control the entanglement between two qubit pair .",
    "this kind of study is not only useful in qubits but also useful in the quantum systems with the dimensions @xmath6 , @xmath7 and in hybrid quantum systems with arbitrary dimensions .",
    "recently we have studied the dynamics in hybrid qubit - qutrit system under dm interaction @xcite .",
    "we observed that the state ( i.e. probability amplitude ) of environmental qubit do not play any role in entanglement dynamics in two parameter qubit - qutrit states .",
    "so in this case one can avoid the intention to prepare the specific state of environmental qubit to manipulate the entanglement in the system .",
    "the dimension @xmath8 corresponds to qutrit .",
    "it has been proved that the usage of qutrit is more secure against a symmetric attack on a quantum key distribution protocol@xcite .",
    "a quantum communication complexity protocol is also proposed by using two entangled qutrits @xcite .",
    "so a qutrit system is of special interest as it has great manifestation and best fit into the dimensionality of hilbert space and increase the computing power .",
    "interestingly with the dimensions @xmath6 , @xmath7 , we also have bound entanglement in nature and its dynamics under various circumstances is the subject of investigation .",
    "the dynamics of bound entangled states has been studied and the phenomenon of distillability sudden death has also been observed @xcite .",
    "motivated from the above mentioned works , we study the dynamics of two qutrit bound entangled states under dm interaction by taking an environmental qutrit which interacts with any one of the qutrit . here",
    "we consider the bound entangled states investigated by jurkowski _",
    "the main goal of the present study is to show that the external dm interaction can be used as a useful resource to produce the free entanglement in two qutrit bound entangled states . once the states are free",
    "then they can be easily distillable .",
    "we also find that the state ( probability amplitude ) of environmental qutrit does not has any role in entanglement dynamics in two qutrit bound entangled states .",
    "however the theoretical investigation of dynamics of qubit quantum networks under dm interaction have also been done by metwally @xcite and aty _ et al .",
    ". the present study can be useful in investigating the utilization of bound entangled states under dm interaction to establish the quantum networks .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we present the hamiltonian of the system considered . two qutrit bound entangled states and reduced system dynamics have been discussed in sect .",
    "3 . in sect .",
    "4 we study the free entanglement and cross norm realignment ( ccnr ) criteria evolutions in two qutrit bound entangled states under dm interaction .",
    "finally , in sect .",
    "5 we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a qutrit ( a)-qutrit ( b ) pair and an environmental qutrit ( c ) which interact with any one of the qutrit of the pair through dm interaction . here",
    ", we assume that the environmental qutrit ( c ) interact with the qutrit ( b ) of the pair . now",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hamiltonian of qutrit ( a ) and qutrit ( b ) and @xmath11 is the interaction hamiltonian of qutrit ( b ) and qutrit ( c ) .",
    "here we consider uncoupled qutrit ( a ) and qutrit ( b ) , so @xmath10 is zero .",
    "+ now the hamiltonian becomes @xmath12 where @xmath13 is dm interaction between qutrit ( b ) and qutrit ( c ) and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the vectors associated to qutrit ( b ) and qutrit ( c ) respectively .",
    "here we assume that dm interaction exist along the z - direction only .",
    "in this case the hamiltonian can be simplified as + @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are gell - mann matrices for qutrit ( b ) and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are x and y gell - mann matrices of qutrit ( c ) respectively .",
    "the above hamiltonian is a matrix having @xmath21 dimension and is easy to diagonalize by using the method of eigendecomposition .",
    "the unitary time evolution operator is easily commutable as @xmath22 which is also a @xmath23 matrix .",
    "this matrix has been used to obtain the time evolution of density matrix of the system .",
    "in this section we discuss the two qutrit bound entangled states investigated by jurkowski _",
    "the density matrix of the states has been given as ,    @xmath24 , \\ \\ \\\\ ] ]    [ eq : b22 ]        where @xmath25 is the normalization constant .",
    "the state depends on the three parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the state satisfy the condition as @xmath29 and for the condition @xmath30 , the state is separable .",
    "it is very difficult to detect the bound entanglement in this family of two qutrit bound entangled states .",
    "jurkowski _ et . al .",
    "_ @xcite have investigated the cases and discussed the bound entanglement detection in the same by using various criteria . here in the present work ,",
    "we only follow the cases investigated by jurkowski , in which the bound entanglement can be detected by using only the ccnr criteria .",

    "it has been observed that the probability amplitudes @xmath47 of environmental qutrit have not been involved in eq.(11 ) , as these are canceled out in the calculations .",
