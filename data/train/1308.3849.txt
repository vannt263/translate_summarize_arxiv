    "the practice of shaping subscribers traffic by internet service providers ( isps ) has been under intensive study ; for example , the effect of isp traffic shaping on various packet - level performance with its detection and policies has been investigated based on actual measurements and mathematical / simulation analyses in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which provides a new insight into the actual performance of broadband access networks at a packet level .",
    "unlike metro and backbone networks , however , access networks directly interface with end - users , so it is important to base the study and design of access networks on the behaviors of and the actual performance perceived by end - users @xcite .",
    "the major goal of our study in this paper , therefore , is to investigate the effect of isp traffic shaping on user - perceived performance , i.e. , the quality of experience ( qoe ) , and thereby to provide isps further insights into the design , deployment , and operation of the next - generation access networks from end - users perspective .",
    "because in access networks the average rate of a service is determined by a service contract between a subscriber and an isp ( e.g. , through subscription tiers ) , which is then controlled accordingly by the token generation rate of a token bucket filter ( tbf ) used in traffic shaping , and the peak rate is usually determined by the underlying access technology ( e.g. , line rates of digital subscriber line ( dsl ) and cable internet ) , we put our major focus on the effect of the token bucket size of a tbf on user - perceived performance given the token generation rate and the peak rate of an access link .",
    "the current study was specifically triggered by the results from recent investigations of `` powerboost '' in @xcite and @xcite , the feature present in some cable broadband networks that enables sharing of unused capacity by giving customers extra bursts of speed whose duration is controlled by the token bucket size . in this paper we extend those investigations of the effect of the token bucket size on packet - level performance at network / transport layers to those on user - perceived performance at application / session layers based on the research framework which we proposed for the clean - slate design of next - generation access networks @xcite .    through the investigation we answer the following key questions :    * * subscriber level *",
    ": if we consider a single subscriber under traffic shaping in isolation , what is the minimum token bucket size providing user - perceived performance _ _ nearly equivalent__. ] to those of a subscriber under no traffic shaping for a given token generation rate and a mix of traffic flows ?    * * access level * : in a shared access , where shaped traffic flows from multiple subscribers interact with one another , what is the effect of the token bucket size on user - perceived performance of all subscribers ?",
    "specifically , how many subscribers can be served with user - perceived performance nearly equivalent to those of a subscriber under no traffic shaping in a dedicated access for a given token generation rate and a mix of traffic flows as well as a token bucket size suggested by the subscriber - level investigation ?",
    "it is this _ trade - off in traffic shaping _ between the performance at subscriber and access levels that interests both subscribers and isps .",
    "considering the bursty nature of traffic flows at multiple layers , e.g. , user behaviors and variable bit rate ( vbr ) encoding at the application / session layers and transmission control protocol ( tcp ) flow and congestion controls at the transport layer , one can expect that at the subscriber level , the user - perceived performance of a subscriber under traffic shaping with loose burst control would approach those of a subscriber under no traffic shaping when the token generation rate is equal to or greater than the long - term average rate of combined traffic flows . at the access level , on the other hand , it is likely that the loose burst control at the subscriber level negatively affects the performance of other subscribers , especially when there are non - conformant or mis - behaving subscribers .",
    "note that the traffic shaping and related issues ( e.g. , multiplexing and scheduling of shaped flows ) have been extensively studied in the context of per - flow / connection traffic shaping and based on packet - level measures since the introduction of the `` leaky bucket '' method in @xcite . in @xcite , the tbf and their analyses with various statistical traffic models are studied . in @xcite ,",
    "the dimensioning of tbf parameters through the notion of a linear - bounded arrival process ( lbap ) is investigated for aggregated voice over internet protocol ( voip ) and long - range dependent ( lrd ) traffic . in @xcite , the performance trade - off of traffic shaping between access control queueing and network queueing",
    "is studied based on the spectral analysis technique , while in @xcite , the characterization of lrd traffic regulated by leaky - bucket policers and shapers is studied using the modified allan variance ( mavar ) for the lrd estimation and spectral analysis of the regulated traffic .",
    "as for scheduling of shaped traffic flows , the end - to - end delay bounds and the buffer space requirements of various scheduling disciplines are well summarized in @xcite .",
    "the results from these studies suggest that given a token generation rate , allowing large bursts through a large token bucket size improves the packet - level performance of an individual flow , while multiplexing of those shaped flows would increase the deterministic bound of end - to - end packet delay . these works ,",
    "however , are not done in the context of isp traffic shaping , where multiple traffic flows with different service types are shaped together by a single tbf , and do not take into account user behaviors in traffic generation and performance perceived by end - users .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , our work in this paper is the first attempt to systematically assess the effect of isp traffic shaping on user - perceived performance with user - behavior - based traffic models at both subscriber and access levels .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec-2 ] provides an overview of the current practice of isp traffic shaping and its major issues .",
    "section [ sec-3 ] describes the methodology we adopt for this investigation with details of experimental setup and a comparative analysis framework .",
    "section [ sec-4 ] presents the results of experimental investigation of the effect of isp traffic shaping at both subscriber and access levels .",
    "section [ sec-5 ] concludes our work in this paper .",
    "traffic shaping was originally devised for connection - oriented networks to regulate an _ individual flow _ per traffic conformance definition negotiated during a connection admission control ( cac ) at a user - network interface ( uni ) @xcite .",
    "it is now used by isps to regulate _ combined flows _ from a subscriber in a different context of connectionless ip networks : because there are no cac procedures used at the uni in the current ip - based networks , isps base their traffic shaping on service contracts with subscribers , which are informal compared to standard traffic conformance definitions ( e.g. , those for guaranteed quality of service ( qos ) in internet @xcite ) .    typically isps use traffic shaping to divide the available capacity of a physical access link ( e.g. , 100 + mbps by docsis 3.0 @xcite ) into smaller ones promised to their subscribers per service contracts @xcite . with the mechanism like tbf , isps",
    "regulate the token generation rate , the token bucket size , and optionally the peak rate of combined traffic flows from each subscriber , which provides reasonable qos to conformant subscribers but prevents non - conformant subscribers from hogging the available bandwidth . at the same time , isps want to allow efficient sharing of unused capacity among active subscribers to improve their experience of internet access , which , like the powerboost , is a way to differentiate their access services from their competitors @xcite .      the current practice of isp traffic shaping incurs the following major issues due to its application to the combined traffic flows from a subscriber and the lack of formal definition of traffic conformance as we discussed .      under the current practice of isp traffic shaping , it is difficult to provide different levels of qos to different types of traffic flows .",
    "for instance , when there are delay - sensitive flows ( e.g. , voip calls ) and large non - real - time data flows ( e.g. , file transfer ) from the same subscriber , the current isp traffic shaping can not differentiate the former from the latter because it is done per subscriber over combined flows . if traffic shaping is done per individual flow as in integrated services ( intserv ) @xcite or at least per class as in differentiated services ( diffserv ) @xcite , this issue can be addressed . to do that , however , we need per - flow or per - class service contracts , which is not the case currently .    as workarounds , two traffic control schemes for large bulk data",
    "flows under the powerboost  one based on intermittent transmission with periodic _ on _ and _ off _ cycles and the other based on wondershaper  are investigated in @xcite , which significantly improve the latency of delay - sensitive flows while achieving similar long - term rates because these schemes do not deplete the tokens at any time and thereby remove the chance of queueing .",
    "the main drawback is that the shaping parameters need to be known in order to exploit this behavior .",
    "another major issue is that guaranteeing qos to the subscribers and enabling efficient sharing of unused capacity among them seemingly contradict each other . for better qos",
    "guarantee , tight burst control is preferred for stricter control of user traffic ; for efficient sharing of unused capacity among active subscribers , on the other hand , loose burst control is desirable as in the powerboost . because the average and the peak rates of a service are determined by a service contract and",
    "underlying access technology respectively , determining a proper size of the token bucket is a key to isp traffic shaping .",
    "the effect of isp traffic shaping , especially the effect of the token bucket size , has been studied with the powerboost : in @xcite , a qualitative investigation of the effect of powerboost on tcp and applications is done , while its impact on isp speed measurements is studied based on the actual results from samknows measurements . in @xcite , the effect of the powerboost",
    "is also studied based on the results obtained from two independent gateway deployments with focus on packet - level performance at the network / transport layers like packet latency and tcp throughput . even though both studies are based on the measurements from field - deployed home gateways and",
    "thereby provide meaningful snapshots of actual broadband access performance , there is neither systematic investigation on the effect of isp traffic shaping on user - perceived performance nor consistent conclusion made even for packet - level performance because so many conditions , including the way and the time of measurements and background traffic from other users , are simply out of control in such large - scale field tests .",
    "they also lack the investigation of the interaction of shaped traffic flows from multiple subscribers in a common shared access network .",
    "the shift from packet - level performance measures to user - perceived ones , together with user - behavior - based traffic generation , demands a new methodology for experiments and the analysis of their results . in this section",
    "we describe the details of experimental platform and system models , generation of traffic and gathering of performance measures , and a framework for a comparative analysis of the results .",
    "due to the complexity of protocols and the interactive nature of traffic in the study of network architectures and protocols , researchers now heavily depend on experiments with simulation and/or test beds implementing proposed architectures and protocols rather than mathematical analyses under simplifying assumptions .",
    "especially the experimental platform for this study should be able to capture the interaction of traffic flows through a complete protocol stack , which are generated based on user behavior models at the application / session layers .",
    "we do also need a full control of the whole end - to - end network configuration to eliminate the effect of complicated factors on the performance measures of interest ( e.g. , background traffic in metro and backbone networks ) .",
    "for these reasons , we implemented a virtual test bed composed of detailed simulation models based on omnet++ @xcite and inet framework @xcite , which provide models for end - user applications as well as a complete tcp / ip protocol stack .",
    "fig.@xmath0[fig : virtual_testbed ] shows an overview of the virtual test bed for a shared access network .",
    "virtual local area network ( vlan)-based implementations of the access switch and the subscriber unit are shown in fig.@xmath0[fig : access_components ] , which abstract key features essential for this study from specific systems like the cable modem termination system ( cmts ) and the cable modem for cable internet and the optical line termination ( olt ) and the optical network unit ( onu ) for passive optical networks ( pons ) .",
    "as for the ( optical ) distribution network ( ( o)dn ) , we use a vlan - aware ethernet switch to model it .",
    "fig.@xmath0[fig : user_model ] also shows a model for an end - user which is connected to the subscriber unit through the uni .",
    "note that there could be multiple _ users _ who share the broadband connection of a _ subscriber _ as shown in fig.@xmath0[fig : virtual_testbed ] .    the reason we adopt vlan - based abstract models for the access switch , the shared distribution network ( i.e. , odn ) , and the subscriber units is that we need models which can provide features common to specific systems ( e.g. , cable internet and ethernet pon ( epon ) ) , while being practical enough to be compatible with other components and systems of the virtual test bed like the backbone router and the application server implementing standard protocols ( e.g. , hyper text transfer protocol ( http ) and file transfer protocol ( ftp ) over tcp / ip ) . to identify each subscriber in our shared access model ,",
    "we assign a unique vlan identifier ( vid ) to each subscriber , which is similar to the service identifier ( sid ) in cable internet and the logical link identifier ( llid ) in epon .",
    "the egress classification in the access switch is based on vids and the classified downstream flows go through tbfs and are scheduled by a round - robin scheduler as shown in fig.@xmath0[fig : access_components ] .",
    "note that , because we mainly focus on the performance of downstream traffic in this paper , we do not consider upstream traffic shaping at the subscriber unit .      as for http and ftp traffic , we use the user - behavior - based traffic model shown in fig.@xmath0[fig : tcp_traffic_model ] , which is based on the model introduced by the 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) for cdma2000 evaluation @xcite .",
    "the ftp traffic is a special case of this model , where there are a request and response(s ) for the main object ( e.g. , a file to download ) only .",
    "the parameter values used for experiments are summarized in table [ tbl : http_ftp_traffic_parameters ] .",
    "note that these traffic models and parameter values are gaining wider acceptance among other standard bodies ( e.g. , wimax forum @xcite and ieee 802.20 @xcite ) and now serving as reasonable consensus models bringing some uniformity in comparisons of systems .    as metrics of user - perceived performance for http and ftp traffic , we collect packet - call - level performance measures during an experiment .",
    "for instance , the web page delay suggested as the main performance metric for web browsing in @xcite corresponds to the packet call delay defined as the time taken from the beginning to the end of a packet call in fig.@xmath0[fig : tcp_traffic_model ] .",
    "likewise , the average page throughput and the mean page transfer rate in @xcite are defined as the ratio of the mean packet call size ( i.e. , the size of all objects in a packet call ) to the mean packet call delay and the mean of all the packet call size to packet call delay ratios , respectively . later in the comparative analysis , even though we obtain all three packet call - level metrics for both traffic types , we mainly use the average packet call delay ( i.e. , the web page delay ) and the average packet call throughput as main metrics for http and ftp traffic , respectively .",

    "we use two video traces for vbr - coded h.264/advanced video coding ( avc ) clips from arizona state university ( asu ) video trace library @xcite  i.e. , the common intermediate format ( cif ) `` star wars iv '' and the high definition ( hd ) format `` terminator2 ''  whose properties are summarized in table [ tbl : video_traffic_overview ] .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the effect of isp traffic shaping on user - perceived performance based on user - behavior - based traffic models for http and ftp services and a real - trace - based one for streaming video and application / session - layer performance metrics .",
    "the results from extensive simulations show that a larger token bucket ( i.e. , up to 100 mb and 1 gb for 100-mbit / s and 1-gbit / s access line rates ) provides better user - perceived performance at both subscriber and access levels .",
    "this implies that the loose burst control ( i.e. , allowing users to send their traffic at a peak rate , much higher than the average service rate ) enables to exploit well the burstiness of real traffic in different time scales and at multiple layers  i.e. , user behaviors ( e.g. , reading time in web browsing ) and vbr encoding at the session layer and tcp congestion control at the transport layer  in statistical multiplexing in the shared access network . regarding any negative impact of the loose burst control ,",
    "on the other hand , we do not observe any significant disadvantage with a larger token bucket in terms of the user - perceived performance of conformant subscribers even in the presence of non - conformant subscribers again up to 100 mb for the access line rate of 100 mbit / s ; with a much larger token bucket ( e.g. , size of 10 gb ) , however , the negative effect of non - conformant subscribers on the user - perceived performance of conformant subscribers becomes clearly visible because the impact of token bucket size and that of token generation rate are virtually indistinguishable in this case .",
    "the results from the current work can provide isps valuable insights into the design , deployment , and operation of the next - generation access networks from end - users perspective , especially for the control of peak rate and burstiness to improve user - perceived performance for their access services .",
    "there are also implications to researchers in the design of next - generation access architectures and protocols , where we need to study a way to better exploit the burstiness of end - user traffic in different time scales and at multiple layers in statistical multiplexing .",
    "still , we do need more investigations with a wider range of network and traffic configurations to reach a firm conclusion on the effect of isp traffic shaping on user - perceived performance .",
    "the rather different outcomes from this work , compared to those based on traditional packet - level traffic models and performance measures , clearly show the very importance of user - oriented research framework in the study of access network architectures and protocols as discussed in @xcite .",
    "one of the major difficulties in this work was the lack of established / standardized behavioral traffic models at higher service and access line rates .",
    "for instance , due to the lack of higher - rate ftp traffic model , we have to use multiple ftp traffic streams to increase the load to the system instead of single higher - rate stream for non - conformant subscribers . with standardized sets of traffic models together with performance metrics",
    ", we could provide both isps and end - users benchmarks and/or rating systems useful for comparison shopping of broadband access services from isps .",
    "in fact , all the efforts described in this paper are aiming at the creation of new benchmarks and/or rating systems for next - generation access and the adoption of them both by isps and end - users for advertising and selecting new service plans .",
    "there is already a proposal called `` internet nutrition labels '' @xcite in this regard , but it is still based on traditional network - level performance measures . our plan is to have new rating systems based on the comparative analysis framework described in sec .",
    "3.3 under several representative workloads , e.g. , user behavior models for web browsing , internet voice / video calls , multimedia streaming , and online gaming .",
    "in this way , the design , deployment , and operation of next - generation access networks will be more energy and cost - efficient by properly managing network resources based on actual user behaviours , not worst - case traffic , and with a direct focus on user - perceived performance .",
    "another area of research for further work is the extension of the multivariate non - inferiority testing to quantiles / percentiles , especially for delay , because it is quite challenging to obtain not only the quantiles themselves but also confidence intervals needed for statistical hypothesis testing @xcite .",
