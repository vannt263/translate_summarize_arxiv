    "many of the unique properties of magnetic systems with quenched random interactions , namely spin glasses , are of dynamical nature ( see @xcite ) . therefore , we would like to understand not only the static properties , but also time dependent features of the spin glass state .",

    "the extended sk model can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be the space of spins .",
    "fixing a positive integer @xmath0 ( denoting the system size ) , define , for each configuration of the spins ( i.e. for each @xmath2 ) , a random hamiltonian @xmath3 , as a function of the configuration @xmath4 and of an exterior source of randomness @xmath5 ( i.e. a random variable defined on another probability space ) .",

    "the spherical gibbs measure is then given by : @xmath32 where the measure @xmath33 is the uniform measure on the sphere @xmath34 ( the presence of the extra factor of @xmath35 is just a matter of convenience and is equivalent to the rescaling @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) . the langevin dynamics for the normalized spherical mixed spin model ( i.e. @xmath30 ) without magnetization ( i.e. @xmath38 ) , was rigurously studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the authors have shown that the dynamics of the system can be characterized via two functions , the so called _ empirical correlation _ and _ empirical response _ and they have derived the pair of coupled integro - differential equations that characterize them .    here",
    ", we shall first extend their results to allow for a positive magnetic field ( i.e. @xmath22 ) and any radius of the underlying sphere .",

    "the equations characterizing the limit as @xmath25 of @xmath58 involve the analogous limit for the _ empirical integrated response function _ : @xmath59 and the limits are characterized as the unique solution of a system of two coupled integro - differential equations .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field requires us to consider also the _ empirical averaged magnetization _ : @xmath60 the _ averaged overlap _ : @xmath61\\e_{\\bb } \\left[x^{i}_t\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] and the _ empirical overlap _ : @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 are two independent replicas , sharing the same couplings @xmath5 , with the noise given by two independent brownian motions @xmath65 . with these notations ,",
