    "the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) is one of the most fundamental lattice equations and plays a prominent role in the theories of optical waveguides , photorefractive crystals , and bose - einstein condensates . for an overview on applications and results",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein . in this paper",
    "we aim in contributing to the mathematical theory of dnls by giving a new variational existence proof for homoclinic standing waves .    in one space dimension",
    "the homogeneous dnls is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the discrete space variable , @xmath2 is the time , and @xmath3 is the complex - valued amplitude or the value of the wave function . the potential function @xmath4 is often assumed to be monomial with @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the cubic and quintic dnls , respectively .    for our purposes it is more convenient to simplify the linear terms by means of the gauge invariance of dnls , that is the symmetry under @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "more precisely , with @xmath9 we readily verify that is equivalent to    @xmath10    it is well established that the dynamical properties of strongly depend on the sign and strength of the coupling parameter @xmath11 . for convex @xmath4 , one usually refers to @xmath12 and @xmath13 as the _ focusing _ and _ defocusing _ case , respectively . in the anti - continuum limit",
    "@xmath14 the dnls becomes a system of uncoupled oscillators , whereas in the continuum limit @xmath15 the dnls can be viewed as a finite difference approximation of the nonlinear schrdinger pde ( via the scaling @xmath16 ) .    during the last decades",
    "a great deal of attention has been paid to coherent structures such as travelling waves and standing waves .",
    "standing waves can be regarded as relative equilibria which stem from the gauge invariance .",
    "they are special solutions to with @xmath17 , where the profile @xmath18 is assumed to take values in @xmath19 and satisfies @xmath20 standing waves come in different types : periodic waves ( or _ wave trains _ ) satisfy @xmath21 for some periodicity length @xmath22 .",
    "homoclinic waves ( _ solitons _ , _ solitary waves _ ) are localized via @xmath23 , and are hence also _",
    "breathers_. finally , heteroclinic waves ( _ fronts _ , _ kinks _ ) connect different asymptotic states .",
    "the existence of standing wave solutions to has been investigated by several authors using rather different methods .",
    "sometimes it is possible to find exact solutions , see @xcite , but in general one needs more sophisticated and robust arguments .",
    "a perturbative approach to the existence problem was developed by mackay and aubry @xcite and relies on continuation method .",
    "the main idea is to start with a given solution in the anti - continuum limit @xmath24 and to show that there is a corresponding solution for small @xmath11 .",
    "continuation arguments have been proven powerful for both analytical considerations and numerical simulations and seem to be the preferred method in the physics community .",
    "the main limitation of any continuation methods , however , is the need of an anchor solution around which the equation is expanded . as a consequence",
    "there is a growing interest in alternative existence proofs for standing waves .",
    "example are dynamical systems approaches @xcite , or variational methods that employ critical point techniques ( linking theorems , nehari manifolds ) to establish the existence of waves with prescribed frequency @xmath25 , see @xcite and @xcite for similar results in dnls with periodic coefficients .",
    "in this paper we rely on a variational setting , which does not prescribe the frequency but the power of a standing wave .",
    "more precisely , we obtain homoclinic standing waves as solutions to a constrained optimization problem , in which the frequency @xmath25 is the lagrangian multiplier .",
    "a similar idea was used by weinstein @xcite for dnls with power nonlinearities , but we allow for a wider class of nonlinear potentials @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , our approach provides more information about the shape of standing waves as it guarantees the existence of waves with unimodal and even profile @xmath26 .",
    "we also emphasize that , contrary to variational methods with prescribed @xmath25 , our existence proof gives rise to an effective approximation scheme for standing waves .",
    "finally , the restriction to the one - dimensional case is not essential but was made for the sake of simplicity .    in oder to sketch the main idea of our method we introduce an energy functional @xmath27 and the power functional @xmath28 by @xmath29 both @xmath28 and @xmath27 are related to conserved quantities for the hamiltonian system .",
    "in fact , @xmath28 is linked to the gauge invariance by noether s theorem , and rearranging the quadratic terms we find @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the hamiltonian corresponding to .",
    "we readily verify that the standing wave equation is equivalent to @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the variational derivative with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "the key observation is that can be considered as the euler  lagrange equation of the optimization problem @xmath34 where @xmath25 plays the role of an lagrangian multiplier .",
    "notice that is equivalent to minimizing the energy @xmath35 subject to prescribed power @xmath28 , which is a well established idea in the theory of standing waves , see @xcite for dnls and @xcite for dispersive hamiltonian pdes .    in this paper",
    "we refine the optimization problem by considering only those profiles @xmath26 that are non - negative , unimodal , and even .",
    "specifically , we solve the optimization problem @xmath36 where the convex cone @xmath37 consists of all profiles @xmath26 that satisfy @xmath38 and @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "of course , we then have to show that each solution to the so restricted optimization problem satisfies the standing wave equation without further multipliers .",
    "it is known that there exist two possible choices for the index @xmath1 . in the _ on - site _ ( or _ site - centered _ ) setting we suppose @xmath41 , whereas in the _ inter - site _ ( or _ bond - centered _ ) setting we choose @xmath42 .",
    "both settings are equivalent on the level of , and even on the level of with @xmath43 , but lead to different results when studying waves with even and unimodal profile @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , on - site waves attain their maximum in an odd number of points centered around @xmath45 ( generically only in @xmath45 ) , whereas the maximum of inter - site waves is realized in an even number of points ( generically only in @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "due to the lack of strong compactness , is not trivial to show that @xmath27 attains its maximum on the set of interest .",
    "a standard strategy would be to employ lion s _ concentration compactness principle _ @xcite , see also @xcite , but we argue differently : at first we consider the analogue to in the space of periodic profiles with @xmath21 . the existence of a maximiser is then granted and the invariance properties of the reversed gradient flow for @xmath27 ensure that the maximizer solves with some multiplier @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , there are no multipliers due to the unimodality constraint , and so we obtain periodic waves with unimodal and even profile . in the second step",
    "we then establish the existence of homoclinic waves by passing to the limit @xmath48 . to this end",
    "we exploit a _ strict maximum condition _ , which replaces the concentration compactness principle and guarantees that the periodic waves are uniformly localized .",
    "we mention that approximation by periodic waves is also used in @xcite , but in a variational setting that prescribes @xmath25 and uses critical techniques to construct saddle points of an action integral .",
    "our main result on standing waves for dnls can be summarized as follows .",
    "[ intro : result ] suppose @xmath12 and that @xmath4 satisfies the super - linear growth and regularity conditions formulated in assumption [ intro : ass ] .",
    "then , in both the on - site and the inter - site setting there exists a one - parameter family of homoclinic standing waves @xmath49 that is parametrized by @xmath50 . for each wave ,",
    "the frequency satisfies @xmath51 and the profile @xmath26 is non - negative , even , unimodal , and exponentially decaying .",
    "we proceed with some remarks concerning the assumptions and assertions of theorem [ intro : result ] .    1 .",
    "the class of admissible @xmath4 includes all convex functions with @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , it contains power nonlinearities @xmath53 but also potentials with saturable derivative such as @xmath54 notice that the dynamical systems approach by qin and xioa @xcite also allows for arbitrary strictly convex @xmath4 and guarantees the existence of a homoclinic wave for all @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "2 .   theorem [ intro : result ] also covers some non - convex potentials as for instance @xmath57 3 .",
    "our results derived below imply @xmath58 as @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , instead of fixing @xmath11 and choosing @xmath59 sufficiently large we can alternatively fix @xmath59 and choose @xmath11 sufficiently small .",
    "we also derive explicit criteria for @xmath4 , which guarantee that @xmath60 and reflect well known results about the _ excitation threshold _ for breathers in 1d , see @xcite .",
    "4 .   theorem  [ intro : result ] provides the existence of _ bright solitons _ for @xmath12 . via the _ staggering transformation _ @xmath61 it also implies the existence of standing waves for the defocusing case @xmath13 .",
    "these resulting waves have an alternating phase structure and are called _ bright gap solitons _ , see @xcite .",
    "however , the most fundamental standing waves for @xmath13 are _ dark solitons _ which correspond to heteroclinic solutions to and require a different variational setting .",
    "this is discussed in @xcite .",
    "we do not claim that the constrained maximization of @xmath27 provides all standing wave solutions to .",
    "it fact , by continuation from the anti - continuum limit it is known that there exist infinitely many _ multipulse solitons _",
    ", see @xcite . however , the careful spectral analysis by pelinovsky et al .",
    "@xcite indicates that most of these multipulse solitons are unstable .",
    "this is true even for unimodal inter - site waves , but at least unimodal on - site waves can be expected to be stable .",
    "we also emphasize that maximisers of the optimization problem can be shown to be orbitally stable @xcite , for instance using the grillakis ",
    "strauss theory , see @xcite and the references therein . due to the additional shape constraint @xmath44 ,",
    "however , this stability result does not apply directly to the waves provided by theorem  [ intro : result ] because it is not clear that the optimization problems and have the same solution .",
    "we conjecture that this is indeed the case but a rigorous proof is still missing .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : prelim ] we formulate our assumptions on @xmath4 and introduce some notations .",
    "we also introduce the strict maximum condition and investigate the maximum of @xmath27 on bounded subsets of @xmath62 . in  [ sec : waves ] we then proof the existence of periodic waves and pass to the limit @xmath48",
    ". finally , we present some numerical simulations in  [ sec : approxwaves ] .",
    "in this paper we always assume @xmath63 and rely on the following standing assumptions on @xmath4 .",
    "[ intro : ass ] the potential @xmath4 is continuously differentiable on @xmath64 and has the following properties .    1 .",

    "3 .   @xmath4 is non - degenerate , i.e. , @xmath68 for @xmath69 .    1 .",
    "assumption [ intro : ass ] implies @xmath70 2 .",
    "each convex and normalized potential @xmath4 grows super - linearly since the function @xmath71 is non - negative due to @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "3 .   assumption [ intro : ass ] is invariant under scalings @xmath74 where @xmath75 are given constants .",
    "this means @xmath4 satisfies assumption [ intro : ass ] if and only if @xmath76 does so .      in what follows",
    "we consider real - valued sequences @xmath77 , called _ profiles _ , where the index set is given by @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the on - site and inter - site setting , respectively . under the periodicity condition @xmath21 for all @xmath1 and some @xmath80 ,",
    "each profile @xmath26 is uniquely determined by its values on a periodicity cell @xmath81 .",

    "specifically , if is satisfied , then the optimization problem has a solution for @xmath86 , and each minimizer is a homoclinic wave with unimodal profile .",
    "moreover , if is violated , then we have @xmath109 , and this implies that has no solution for @xmath86 .",

    "notice that this is in accordance with our theoretical results : since we have @xmath279 for small @xmath280 , the existence of homoclinic waves is guaranteed only for sufficiently large @xmath59",
    ".    a similar phenomenon can be observed in figure [ fig : numex3 ] , which illustrates the limit @xmath48 for @xmath281 for sufficiently large @xmath11 we have @xmath282 as @xmath48 and the periodic waves converge ( weakly in @xmath62 ) to zero .",
    "if @xmath11 is sufficiently small , however , we have @xmath283 and the periodic waves converge ( strongly in @xmath62 ) to a non - trivial homoclinic wave .",
