    "an ` hodograph ' is the orbit in velocity space that corresponds to the trajectory of a particle in ordinary space , traversed by the tip of the velocity vectors when these are drawn all starting from the same point , the origin of velocity space .",
    "it was introduced by hamilton @xcite as an essential tool in proving , using _ geometrical _ relations rather that analytical , that kepler s 1st law follows from newton s law of universal attraction , the laws of mechanics and kepler s 2nd law .",
    "the hodographs of keplerian motion  indeed of all classical motion under @xmath0 potentials  have the very special property that they are full circles or circular arcs for all possible trajectories , and the geometrical proof asserts the connection between these circles and the spatial trajectories being conic sections .",
    "hamilton s proposition was soon after elaborated by maxwell @xcite .",
    "however , for some unclear reason ( perhaps because the geometrical approach became less and less familiar to students ) hamilton s method and the hodograph are hardly mentioned in standard mechanics textbooks , even such prominent ones as goldstein s @xcite or landau & lifshitz @xcite .",
    "keplerian motion is discussed there only analytically and only via the trajectory in ordinary space , although , for instance , goldstein certainly knew of hamilton s method @xcite .",
    "so much so , that when feynman prepared what came to be known as his ` lost lecture ' @xcite he re - developed hamilton s method anew , apparently unaware of the work of his predecessors .",
    "since then there appear in the literature from time to time re - iterations and some extensions of hamilton s method ( many times also attributed to feynman ) for kepler / coulomb ( kc ) systems , mainly from a pedagogical point of view complementing the bits missing in textbooks @xcite .",
    "it is also noted that hodographs became useful tools in dynamical systems other than kc @xcite",
    ".    however , even analytically , using the hodograph to solve newtonian kc systems is much simpler than the analytic solution in ordinary space @xcite .",
    "the unique feature of kc systems , which allows this simplicity and elegance , is the _ linearity _ of the hodograph equation ( see ) , a direct consequence of the @xmath0 nature of the potential .",
    "although the relativistic trajectories are much more complicated than the newtonian ones , the virtue of linearity of the hodograph equations persists into the relativistic regime ( equations & ) .",
    "besides an interest in relativistic applications of the hodograph method _ per se _ , our interest in the hodograph solution for relativistic coulomb systems also stems from an interest in the relativistic em 2-body system , which so far does nt have a satisfactory solution in the special - relativistic non - quantum realm @xcite .",
    "the success of using the hodograph method with newtonian kc systems gives rise to the hope that with its application to relativistic em systems a general solution may be advanced .",
    "it is therefore also in this context that the present work has been performed .",
    "newtonian kc 2-body systems may be reduced to 1-body systems by transition to the centre - of - mass ( cm ) reference frame .",
    "such a simple and direct procedure is impossible , in general , for relativistic 2-body systems because the interaction is not instantaneous .",
    "it is therefore convenient to start with coulomb systems , which may be regarded as the limit of em 2-body systems when one of the charges is much heavier than the other , modeling hydrogen - like atoms or rutherford scattering .",
    "such relativistic coulomb systems were discussed only few times in the literature ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ; also @xcite and references therein ) , almost always using only standard analytic methods to determine the particle s trajectory in ordinary space .",
    "the purpose of the present work is therefore to study the dynamics of a relativistic charged particle in coulomb field in velocity space , aiming to obtain , possibly with some simplicity and elegance , new and further insights into the dynamics of such systems .",
    "a brief but illustrated summary of our results is published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the full presentation splits here into two parts .",
    "the present article brings the theory of the relativistic hodographs , presenting and discussing the various solutions .",
    "it starts with reviewing the classical hodograph method ( ) and presentation of the relativistic velocity space ( ) . then the relativistic hodograph equations are discussed ( ) and general properties of the hodographs are deduced thereof ( ) .",
    "these are followed by explicit discussion , accompanied with exemplary illustrations , of all the possible solutions of the hodograph equations ( & [ sec : excrel ] ) .",
    "the special internal symmetry of these systems is then discusses in a companion article @xcite .",
    "_ notation_. the convention @xmath2 is used throughout , unless specified otherwise .",
    "events in minkowski space - time are @xmath3 , with metric tensor @xmath4 . for any 4-vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 , their inner product is then @xmath7 .",
    "we start with reviewing the essentials of the classical kc analytic hodograph solution . further information and discussions may be found in various publications @xcite .    considering the classical kc equation of motion",
    "@xmath8 it is convenient to assume the @xmath9 coordinates for the plane of motion , with the conserved angular momentum @xmath10 perpendicular to it .",
    "we also use polar coordinates @xmath11 with the polar - planar unit vectors @xmath12 satisfying @xmath13 an essential aspect of the hamilton - feynman method is the change from @xmath14-dependence to @xmath15-dependence , employing kepler s 2nd law which is the angular - momentum conservation law , @xmath16 then , with @xmath17 , the momentum equation becomes simply @xmath18 and using the relation @xmath19 the solution of is immediate , @xmath20 with @xmath21 some arbitrary constant vector .",
    "clearly , the simplicity of equation which leads to this solution is due to the @xmath22 force .",
    "the solution describes a circle ( or at least a circular arc for unbound systems ) in velocity space , @xmath23 centred around @xmath21 and with radius @xmath24 .",
    "using the relation @xmath25 , the energy integral becomes , for total energy @xmath26 , @xmath27 from which it is easily verified , substituting in , that @xmath28 for any given value of @xmath29 , the case of minimal energy @xmath30 is with @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding hodograph is a canonical circle @xmath32 drawn by the tips of the vectors @xmath33 centred at the origin of velocity space , with circular spatial motion ( ) . , [ fig:2 ] & [ fig:3 ] share a common colour code : velocity vectors @xmath34 are purple , the hamilton vector @xmath21 is brown , and the vectors @xmath35 are in red .",

    "+    the ( constant ) vector @xmath21 is known as the _ hamilton vector_. its magnitude @xmath40 , depending on the energy via , determines the relative position of the vector : for @xmath41 the vector @xmath21 lies within the hodograph , touches it or exceeds it , corresponding to elliptic , parabolic or hyperbolic spatial trajectories , respectively ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in either case ,",
    "the physical interpretation is that the hamilton vector @xmath21 transforms the hodographs between configurations that correspond to different values of the energy , while keeping the same value of the angular momentum .",
    "the relativistic velocity space ( rvs ) is the space of all future - directed time - like unit 4-vectors , and its usage has the virtue of transforming and displaying kinematical and dynamical properties in a purely geometrical manner .",
    "since there is no explicit dependence on time , different points in it may correspond either to the velocity states of different particles in some instantaneous reference frame , or the velocity state of a particle in different instances along its world - line .    to the author s best knowledge , the most thorough account of the rvs is by rhodes and semon @xcite .",
    "they point at an exercise contained already in the 1951 english edition of landau & lifshitz  classical theory of fields \" @xcite as the first time the idea of rvs appeared in english ( for an account of the earlier history of the rvs see a comment by criado and alamo @xcite ) . while the landau & lifshitz exercise dealt only with the metric properties of the rvs , later applications of the rvs @xcite focus on geometrical derivation of the thomas - wigner rotation .",
    "so far , the association of geometry to the rvs used the spatial velocity @xmath39 for the rvs coordinates , and the metric properties derived from the lorentz formulae for relativistic velocity addition @xcite .",
    "instead , we use here the relativistic velocity 4-vector @xmath42 with the rvs defined as @xmath43 this is a 3-d unit hyperboloid ( @xmath1 ) embedded in a 4-d pseudo - euclidian space @xmath44 also , for any @xmath45 , let @xmath46 be the hyperplane tangent to @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "any vector @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 .    using @xmath48 as",
    "the coordinates of the rvs allows to relate the geometrical properties of the hyperbolic space with relativistic kinematics and dynamics in a lorentz - covariant manner .",
    "the geometrical properties of the rvs then follow straight - forward .",
    "further properties of the rvs are discussed in the companion article @xcite .",
    "a relativistic coulomb system consists of a point particle with mass @xmath51 whose dynamics is determined by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath52 with the equation of motion identical in form to the newtonian one @xmath53 the total energy @xmath54 and angular momentum @xmath55 are conserved , the latter satisfying @xmath56 as the relativistic generalization of the newtonian angular - momentum conservation law .",
    "solving the momentum equation in the velocity space provides an elegant and simple solution for the motion in a relativistic coulomb system .",
    "the key to the hodograph or velocity space picture is the angular momentum conservation law , the relativistic counterpart of kepler s 2nd law .",
    "it allows , as above , transition to @xmath15 as the hodograph parameter .",
    "the ( spatial ) linear momentum of the particle is @xmath57 , so the momentum equation becomes @xmath58 using the polar representation @xmath59 , the polar - angular equations derived from are @xmath60 complemented by the @xmath61-equation also derived from , @xmath62 equations ( or , alternatively , ) and constitute the relativistic hodograph equations .",
    "the relation @xmath63 another consequence of , allows transition from spatial dependencies to velocity dependencies . in particular , the conserved energy is @xmath64 so using , the energy integral becomes @xmath65 which may also be recognized as an immediate integral of equations and .",
    "the virtue of equations , and is their linearity with constant coefficients in the polar representation , a unique feature of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "therefore , explicit solutions providing the hodographs and the corresponding spatial trajectories are quite immediate to get . however , there is much information and insight that may be obtained from just studying the equations themselves .",
    "we start with this study in the following section , deferring the explicit solutions to and [ sec : excrel ] .",
    "recalling that the velocity space @xmath47 is embedded in a psudo - euclidean space @xmath66 , we note that the hodograph equations and may be combined and considered for arbitrary orbits @xmath67 in @xmath66 , not necessarily confined to @xmath68 , as @xmath69 with @xmath70 since @xmath71 , it immediately follows , as a general property of the hodograph equations , that if @xmath72 and @xmath73 are both orbits in @xmath66 that satisfy then the inner product @xmath74 is constant .",
    "therefore , any solution of the hodograph equations is of constant magnitude , and their motion can only be rotational .",
    "since the hodograph equations in the polar representation & are with constant coefficients , it follows that generates rotation in @xmath66 relative to the polar coordinates . in order to identify the axis of rotation",
    ", we note that the 4-vector @xmath75 is a particular solution of which is constant relative to the polar coordinates with components @xmath76 and @xmath77 for any solution @xmath78 of .",
    "@xmath79 is therefore identified as the axis vector , relative to the polar system , of the pseudo - rotation generated by in @xmath66 .",
    "the physical significance of the axis vector @xmath79 is that the energy integral is identified , for any hodograph @xmath48 in @xmath68 , as the constant @xmath80-component along @xmath79 , @xmath81 its spatial part is the classical 3-vector @xmath82 which generates the base canonical circle @xmath83 whose shifting by the hamilton vector @xmath21 produces the ( newtonian ) hodograph .",
    "@xmath79 is therefore the @xmath66 extension of @xmath84 .",
    "it is evident from equations - and the foregoing discussion that the nature of the solution , both for the spatial trajectory and the hodograph , depends on the dimensionless parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "some further insights thus ensue :    1 .",
    "the relation @xmath87 implies @xmath88 . since @xmath89 it follows from the energy integral that @xmath90 therefore ,",
    "if @xmath91 then @xmath92 can only be negative ( attraction ) , and for @xmath93 ( repulsion ) necessarily @xmath94 .",
    "the relation @xmath87 also implies that @xmath95 ( corresponding to @xmath96 ) is possible only for unbound systems .",
    "the relation @xmath97 together with the energy constraint yield the relation for the polar components , @xmath98 ( this looks like an equation of conic sections in velocity space , but the variables here are the polar components and not cartesian ones , so the actual orbit is much more complicated . )",
    "then it follows from that for the limiting states @xmath99 and therefore necessarily @xmath94 for unbound systems .",
    "3 .   the limiting states @xmath95 for @xmath96 define corresponding angles @xmath100 and @xmath101 , so that an infinite spatial trajectory becomes a finite segment in velocity space with @xmath15 in the range @xmath102 .",
    "near @xmath100 the particle s motion is towards the centre of force , therefore there @xmath103 , while near @xmath101 the particle recedes from the centre of force and there @xmath104 .",

    ", it follows that @xmath107 is parallel to @xmath108 in both endpoints .",
    "this means that in the projection of the hodograph on the @xmath109-@xmath110 plane , the vector @xmath108 is tangent to the hodograph .",
    "it is the same characteristic of the endpoints as in the newtonian case .",

    "@xmath117      further insight requires explicit solution of the hodograph equations .",
    "the relativistic hodograph equations are and , constrained with .",
    "these equations may be uncoupled by computing second derivatives , yielding , for the polar components , @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "this will serve now as the basic equation from which the solutions , in all cases , will be deduced .",
    "it is clear that the nature of the solution depends on the coefficient of @xmath121 in , namely on the ratio @xmath24 .",
    "this is directly related with the magnitude of the axis vector @xmath122 @xmath24 is the magnitude of the spatial velocity on the basis circle formed by @xmath79 , @xmath123 , whose projection on the @xmath124-@xmath125(@xmath126)-plane is the minimal energy circle in the newtonian limit @xmath127 ( see ; the same notation @xmath32 is used for both circles for convenience ) .",

    "perhaps the most significant feature of the relativistic velocity space @xmath47 is its being a curved manifold ",
    "hyperboloid @xmath1  embedded in the 4-d pseudo - euclidean space @xmath66 . in the newtonian velocity space , being euclidean @xmath242 , the minimum energy circle @xmath32 retains its shape when translated by the hamilton vector for higher energy states ( & [ fig:3 ] ) . in @xmath47 , on the other hand , the base circle @xmath32 , created by the vector @xmath79 ( see ) , when shifted necessarily creates a 3-d trajectory .",
    "moreover , it is evident from that only in the case @xmath128  for which the spatial velocities on the base circle @xmath32 are subluminal  the vector @xmath79 , being time - like , points towards the interior of @xmath68 .",
    "then , if continued , it punches through the hyperboloid into its interior and draws on it a horizontal circle which is the minimum energy hodograph @xmath243 . only in this case ( @xmath128 ) a nonrelativistic limit exists .",
    "the corresponding spatial trajectories show the familiar features of rotating conic sections @xcite , such as rosettes for bound states or encircling the centre of force in unbound states .    otherwise , for @xmath129 , @xmath79 points outside of the hyperboloid : a light - like @xmath79 ( for @xmath131 ) , if continued , approaches the hyperboloid asymptotically , while a space - like @xmath79 ( for @xmath132 ) , if continued , recedes from the hyperboloid . in either case",
    ", @xmath79 can not draw a circle on the hyperboloid , and no nonrelativistic limit exists . in the absence of a non - relativistic limit the spatial trajectories in these cases feature unfamiliar properties , like spiraling and collapsing into the centre of force @xcite .",
    "the common feature of all newtonian kc hodographs is them being circles , or circular arcs , whose radius depends very simply on the angular momentum as @xmath244 , independently of the energy .",
    "the energy dependence enters only through the magnitude of the ( constant ) hamilton vector @xmath21 , which uniformly displaces the hodograph from the minimum energy state to its actual state ; the direction of @xmath21 determines the orientation of the spatial trajectory . the existence of constant or conserved quantity that determines the configuration of a physical system is usually regarded as an indication of a symmetry .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to regard these features as constituting a symmetry , which we call _ hamilton symmetry _  a symmetry that acts on the hodographs in velocity space , changing the value @xmath245 of the energy while keeping the same value @xmath29 for the angular momentum .",
    "since the newtonian velocity space is euclidean , the action of the newtonian hamilton symmetry is additive and therefore straight - forward .",
    "but on the hyperbolic @xmath47 the action of hamilton symmetry is much more intricate and deserves discussion .",
    "the study of hamilton symmetry for relativistic coulomb systems is the subject of the companion article @xcite , high - lighting various features of these systems not realized otherwise . besides the interest in this physical issue _ per se _ , it is hopes that it may also assist towards a full solution of the relativistic 2-body em problem .",
