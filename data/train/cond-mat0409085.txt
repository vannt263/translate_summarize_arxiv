    "<S> we summarize our recent findings on how current - driven magnetization switching and magnetoresistance in nanofabricated magnetic multilayers are affected by varying the spin - scattering properties of the non - magnetic spacers , the relative orientations of the magnetic layers , and spin - dependent scattering properties of the interfaces and the bulk of the magnetic layers . </S>",
    "<S> we show how our data are explained in terms of current - dependent effective magnetic temperature . </S>"
