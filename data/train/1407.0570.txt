    "we consider a permutation to be simply an arrangement of the numbers @xmath2 for some positive @xmath3 .",
    "a permutation @xmath4 is said to be _ contained _ in another permutation @xmath5 if @xmath5 has a subsequence whose terms have the same relative ordering as those of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , @xmath6 is contained in @xmath7 because the subsequence @xmath8 is ordered in the same way as @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath4 is not contained in @xmath5 then we say that @xmath5 _ avoids _ @xmath4 .",
    "for example , @xmath7 avoids @xmath9 . in the context of containment and avoidance , a permutation",
    "is often called a _",
    "pattern_.    the containment relation is a partial order on the set of all permutations , and a set of permutations closed downwards ( a down - set ) in this partial order is called a _",
    "permutation class_. it is natural to define a permutation class by the minimal set of permutations that it avoids .",
    "this minimal forbidden set of patterns is known as the _ basis _ of the class . the class with basis @xmath10 is denoted @xmath11 .",
    "given a permutation class @xmath12 , we denote by @xmath13 the set of permutations in @xmath12 of length @xmath3 .",
    "the ( univariate ) _ generating function _ of @xmath12 is then @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the length of @xmath5 .",
    "the _ growth rate _ of @xmath12 is defined by the limit @xmath16{|\\ccc_n| } , $ ] if it exists .",
    "it is widely believed ( see the first conjecture in  @xcite ) that all permutation classes have a growth rate .    in the study of permutation classes ,",
    "there has been significant interest in deriving the generating functions for classes with a few small basis elements ( see  @xcite for an up - to - date list of results ) .",
    "this has led to the enrichment of the theory of permutation classes due to the requisite development of a variety of enumeration techniques .",
    "we add to this work by proving the following two theorems :    * hasse graphs *    corresponding to each permutation @xmath5 , we define an ordered plane graph @xmath17 , which we call its _ hasse graph_. if @xmath18 is the poset on the points @xmath19 in which @xmath20 if both @xmath21 and @xmath22 , then @xmath17 is the graph corresponding to the hasse diagram of @xmath18 . see the figures throughout this paper for illustrations showing the hasse graphs of permutations . in practice , we tend not to distinguish between a permutation and its hasse graph",
    ". the minimal elements of the poset @xmath18 are known as the _ left - to - right minima _ of the permutation @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , maximal elements of @xmath18 are called _ right - to - left maxima _ of @xmath5 .",
    "hasse graphs of permutations were previously considered by bousquet - mlou & butler  @xcite , who determined the algebraic generating function of the family of _ forest - like _ permutations whose hasse graphs are acyclic .",
    "more recently , they have been used by the present author  @xcite to establish a new lower bound for the growth rate of @xmath23 .    given a permutation @xmath5 ,",
    "we partition the vertices of @xmath17 by spanning it with a sequence of graphs , which we call the _ source graphs _ of @xmath5 .",
    "there is one source graph for each left - to - right minimum of @xmath5 .",
    "suppose @xmath24 are the vertices of @xmath17 corresponding to the left - to - right minima of @xmath5 , listed from left to right .",
    "then the @xmath25th source graph @xmath26 is the graph induced by @xmath27 and those vertices of @xmath17 lying above and to the right of @xmath27 that are not in @xmath28 .",
    "we refer to @xmath27 as the _ root _ of source graph @xmath26 .",
    "see figure  [ figfperm ] for an illustration .",
    "the structure of the source graphs of permutations in a specific permutation class is constrained by the need to avoid the patterns in the basis of the class .",
    "if the source graphs for some class are acyclic , we refer to them as _ source trees_.    the _ bottom subgraph _ of a hasse graph is the graph induced by its lowest vertex ( the least entry in the permutation ) and all the vertices lying above and to its right . observe that the bottom subgraph may contain vertices from more than one source graph .",
    "for example , the bottom subgraph of the hasse graph in figure  [ figfperm ] contains vertices from three source graphs .",
    "bottom subgraphs of permutations in a specific permutation class satisfy the same structural restrictions as do the source graphs .",
    "we refer to an acyclic bottom subgraph as a _",
    "bottom subtree_.    we build the hasse graph of a permutation by starting with a source graph and then repeatedly adding another source graph to the lower right .",
    "the technique is similar to that of `` adding a slice '' , which has been used to enumerate constrained compositions and other classes of polyominoes , a topic of interest in statistical mechanics ( see , for example , bousquet - mlou s review paper  @xcite , the books of van rensburg  @xcite and guttmann  @xcite , and flajolet & sedgewick  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* examples  iii.22 and  v.20 ) ) .",
    "when a source graph is added , its vertices are interleaved horizontally with the non - root vertices of the bottom subgraph of the graph built from the previous source graphs .",
    "typically , the positioning of the vertices of the new source graph is constrained by the need to avoid forbidden patterns .    in order to derive the univariate generating functions we require , we make use of multivariate functions involving additional `` catalytic '' variables that record certain parameters of the bottom subgraph of the permutations . these additional variables enable us to establish recurrence relations which we can then solve using the kernel method . typically ,",
    "when employing a multivariate generating function , we treat it simply as a function of the relevant catalytic variable , writing , for example , @xmath29 rather than @xmath30 .",
    "occasionally , we also make use of a variant of the symbolic structural notation presented in flajolet & sedgewick  @xcite to establish functional equations .",
    "in particular , @xmath31 is the atomic class consisting of a single vertex , and we use @xmath32 to represent a possibly empty sequence of elements of @xmath33 and @xmath34 to represent a non - empty sequence of elements of @xmath33 .",
    "the two classes we enumerate are quite distinct structurally . a source graph in @xmath35 consists of a root together with a @xmath36avoider formed from the non - root vertices . however , the presence of a @xmath36 forces any subsequent source graph to be simply a fan . in contrast , @xmath37 has plane source graphs and a much more uniform structure .",
    "we enumerate @xmath35 in section  [ sectf ] . in doing so",
    ", the kernel method is used six times to solve the relevant functional equations .",
    "the class @xmath37 is enumerated in section  [ secte ] .",
    "this requires an unusual simultaneous double application of the kernel method .",
    "let us use @xmath38 to denote @xmath35 .",
    "the structure of class @xmath38 depends critically on the presence or absence of occurrences of the pattern @xmath36 . in light of this ,",
    "to enumerate this class , we partition it into three sets @xmath33 , @xmath39 and @xmath12 as follows :    @xmath40 .",
    "every permutation in @xmath39 contains at least one occurrence of a @xmath36 , but avoids @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "every permutation in @xmath12 contains a @xmath42 or a @xmath43 .",

    "let @xmath48 denote the set of source graphs in set @xmath33 .",
    "now , each member of @xmath48 is simply a _ fan _ , a root vertex connected to a ( possibly empty ) sequence of pendant edges .",

    "when enumerating @xmath33 , we use the variable @xmath49 to mark the _ number of leaves _ ( non - root vertices ) in the bottom subtree . the generating function for @xmath48 is thus given by @xmath50    we now consider the process of building an @xmath33permutation from a sequence of source trees .",

    "thus the appropriate linear operator is @xmath139 \\;=\\ ; s_\\pp(u)\\+\\frac{f(1)-u\\+f(u)}{1-u}.\\ ] ]      the set , @xmath140 , of source graphs that can be added using the second method satisfies the structural equation @xmath141 in which the third term on the right identifies the u - tree which is positioned immediately to the left of the rightmost ( path ) u - tree in the bottom subgraph .",
    "this specification thus counts multiple times those source graphs that can be added in more than one way due to the presence of a non - empty initial sequence of single - vertex u - trees .",
    "note also that we do nt mark the initial sequence of single - vertex u - trees with @xmath49 .",
    "the generating function for @xmath140 is @xmath142 the action of adding a source graph using the second method is then seen to be reflected by the following linear operator : @xmath143 \\;=\\ ; s^\\star(u)\\+\\frac{f_\\pp(1)-f_\\pp(u)}{1-u } .\\ ] ] finally , let us consider when adding a source graph to an arbitrary member of @xmath135 creates another permutation in @xmath135 .",
    "the second method creates an element of @xmath135 if the source graph is in @xmath132 and its rightmost ( path ) u - tree is added to the right of the bottom subgraph .",
    "an element of @xmath135 is also created if the source graph has a single path u - tree or consists of a single vertex ( the root ) .",
    "thus the set , @xmath144 , of source graphs , counted with multiplicity , that can be added to create an element of @xmath135 satisfies the structural equation @xmath145 its generating function is @xmath146 and the corresponding linear operator is @xmath147 \\;=\\ ; s_\\pp^\\star(u)\\+\\frac{f_\\pp(1)-f_\\pp(u)}{1-u}.\\ ] ]    we are now in a position to derive the generating function for @xmath114 and hence prove theorem  [ thme ] . from the analysis above ,",
    "we know that the bivariate generating function @xmath136 of class @xmath114 is defined by the following pair of mutually recursive functional equations : @xmath148 & \\!+\\ ! & \\oper_{\\pp\\ee}\\big[p(u)\\big ] \\\\[3pt ]     p(u ) & = & s_\\pp(u ) & \\!+\\ ! & \\oper_{\\ee\\pp}\\big[e(u)\\big ] & \\!+\\ ! & \\oper_{\\pp\\pp}\\big[p(u)\\big ]    \\end{array }   .\\ ] ] these can be expanded to give the following : @xmath149 @xmath150 an unusual simultaneous double application of the kernel method can then be used to yield the algebraic generating function for class @xmath114 as follows .",
    "first , we eliminate @xmath151 from and , and express @xmath152 in terms of @xmath153 and @xmath154 as a rational function . cancelling the resulting kernel , @xmath155 with the appropriate root",
    "then gives us an equation relating @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "secondly , we eliminate @xmath152 from and , and express @xmath151 in terms of @xmath153 and @xmath154 . cancelling the ( same ) kernel ( using a different root )",
    "gives a second equation relating @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "finally , we eliminate @xmath154 from these two equations to yield an extremely complicated explicit expression for @xmath153 .",
    "thus , using a computer algebra system to handle the details of the algebraic manipulation , it can be determined that the generating function @xmath156 for @xmath37 has the minimal polynomial @xmath157 the growth rate of the class is given by the reciprocal of the least positive real singularity of its generating function  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems  iv.6 and  iv.7 ) .",
    "hence , by determining the location of the singularities of @xmath153 , it is possible to establish that the growth rate of class @xmath114 is approximately 5.1955 , the greatest real root of the quintic polynomial @xmath158 as required .",
