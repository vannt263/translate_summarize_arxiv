    "let @xmath0 be an abelian category . in  @xcite we learned a one - to - one correspondence between complete cotorsion pairs in @xmath0 and abelian model structures on @xmath0 .",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with this correspondence .",
    "let s recall that an abelian model structure on @xmath0 is equivalent to a triple of classes @xmath9 for which @xmath10 is thick and which admits two complete cotorsion pairs @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this data is equivalent to an abelian model structure on @xmath0 where @xmath10 are the trivial objects , @xmath5 are the cofibrant objects and @xmath7 are the fibrant objects . in practice",
    "virtually all the abelian model structures we encounter also have the extra condition that they are _",
    "hereditary_. this just means that @xmath5 is closed under taking kernels of epimorphisms between objects in @xmath5 and @xmath7 is closed between taking cokernels of monomorphisms between objects in @xmath7 .",
    "we will assume this throughout this note , that the cotorsion pairs are hereditary .",
    "now let s denote these cotorsion pairs by @xmath13 it is easy to note the following properties of these two complete hereditary cotorsion pairs :    1 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath14 .",
    "2 .   @xmath15 .",
    "remarkably , there is a converse to this as we will prove in this note .",
    "so our goal is to prove the following theorem .",
    "[ them - main ] let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be two complete hereditary cotorsion pairs satisfying conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above .",
    "then there is a unique thick class @xmath10 for which @xmath9 is a hovey triple .",
    "moreover , this thick class @xmath10 can be described in the two following ways : @xmath16    the proof we give is both elementary and very general .",
    "it holds in the general setting of when @xmath0 is a weakly idempotent complete exact category .",
    "the author showed in  @xcite that hovey s correspondence carries over to this setting .",
    "so while we state the theorems in the setting of abelian categories we have particularly constructed the proofs so that they hold in a general weakly idempotent complete exact category .",
    "the author again wishes to thank hanno becker and the referee of his paper  @xcite .",
    "the construction of hovey triples that we give here is a direct generalization of a construction of becker from  @xcite . in particular , when the two given cotorsion pairs are _ injective _ , then our construction is exactly becker s right bousfield localization construction from  @xcite . on the other hand , when the two given cotorsion pairs are _ projective _ , then our construction coincides with becker s left bousfield localization construction from  @xcite . the main difference in our proof , when comparing it to becker s proof ,",
    "is in how we show that the class of trivial objects @xmath10 is thick . our proof , while longer , is more direct and uses only elementary properties of short exact sequences .",
    "finally , the author wishes to thank mark hovey , who the author has been fortunate to work with over the years .",
    "it was during a recent exchange that the author found theorem  [ them - main ] , and it solves the problem of finding the gorenstein ac - flat model structure on the category of ( left ) modules over an arbitrary ring .",
    "this is the flat analog of the gorenstein ac - injective and gorenstein ac - projective model structures of  @xcite .",
    "these applications , and others , will appear elsewhere .",
    "but the author finds theorem  [ them - main ] to be of interest in its own right .",
    "we wish to prove theorem  [ them - main ] .",
    "so assume @xmath1 and @xmath2 are two complete hereditary cotorsion pairs satisfying conditions        we start by showing that the two classes below that define @xmath10 do coincide .",
    "@xmath16 so say @xmath17 is in the top class , that is , that there is a short exact sequence @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 . since @xmath21 has enough projectives we can find a short exact sequence @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "now since @xmath27 and the cotorsion pairs are hereditary we conclude @xmath28 .",
    "now the left vertical column shows that @xmath17 is in the bottom class describing @xmath10 . a similar argument",
    "will show that any @xmath17 in the bottom class must be in the top class .",
    "so the two descriptions of @xmath10 coincide .",
    "we start by showing @xmath10 is closed under retracts .",
    "so let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be such that @xmath32 .",
    "we wish to show @xmath33 .",
    "start by writing @xmath34 and also apply the fact that @xmath2 has enough injectives to get a short exact sequence @xmath35 . now construct a commutative diagram as shown below : @xmath36 the map @xmath37 exists because @xmath38 and similarly the map @xmath39 exists because @xmath40 .",
    "next , the two right vertical maps exist simply by the universal property of @xmath41 and @xmath42 being cokernels .",
    "next denote the map @xmath43 by @xmath44 , and its cokernel @xmath45 by @xmath46 .",
    "then we see @xmath47 .",
    "so again the universal property of @xmath41 being the cokernel of @xmath44 gives us a map @xmath48 such that @xmath49 .",
    "this proves that @xmath50 factors through @xmath41 , but now we argue that this implies @xmath50 actually factors through an object of @xmath15 . indeed using that @xmath2 has enough injectives we find @xmath51 , but this time it follows that @xmath52 . now using that @xmath53 , we see that @xmath48 extends over @xmath54 .",
    "so we see that we can find maps @xmath55 and @xmath56 such that @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "thus the composition below is the identity @xmath59 . @xmath60 but this just means @xmath61 is a retract of @xmath62 . since @xmath8 is closed under direct sums and retracts get that @xmath19 .",
    "this proves @xmath33 and we are done .",
    "we now turn to the two out of three property and our next immediate goal is to show closure of @xmath10 under extensions .",
    "note now that @xmath10 clearly contains both @xmath6 and @xmath8 , for we will use this ahead .",
    "we start by making the following claim .    .",
    "suppose @xmath63 is exact with @xmath19 and @xmath30 .",

    "@xmath10 is closed under extensions .",
    "now suppose @xmath77 is exact with @xmath78 .",
    "we need to prove that @xmath79 too .",
