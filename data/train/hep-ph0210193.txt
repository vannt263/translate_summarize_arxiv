    "the _ neutrinos at the tevatron _ ( nutev ) experiment @xcite at fermilab has measured the ratios of neutral to charged current events in muon ( anti)neutrino  nucleon scattering : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and has determined the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite to be @xmath12 the standard model ( sm ) predictions of these parameters based on a global fit to non - nutev data , cited as @xmath13_\\mathrm{sm}=0.3042 $ ] and @xmath14_\\mathrm{sm}=0.0301 $ ] in ref .",
    "@xcite , differ from the nutev result by @xmath15 in @xmath10 .",
    "this disagreement between nutev and the sm ( as determined by non - nutev data ) is sometimes referred to as the nutev ` anomaly ' @xcite .",
    "various suggestions have been forwarded as the cause of this discrepancy @xcite .",
    "these include theoretical uncertainties due to qcd effects , tree level and loop effects resulting from new physics , and nuclear physics effects .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review . in this paper",
    ", we investigate one explanation which is particularly attractive in its simplicity and economy .",
    "note that the nutev value of @xmath10 is _ smaller _ than the sm prediction .",
    "this is because the ratios @xmath16 and @xmath17 were both smaller than expected , _",
    "i.e. _ the neutral current events were not as numerous as predicted by the sm when compared to the charged current events .",
    "in addition , the invisible width of the @xmath0 measured at the cern / slac @xmath18 colliders lep / slc is also known to be @xmath19 below the sm prediction @xcite .",
    "both observations suggest that the couplings of the neutrinos to the @xmath0 boson are suppressed with respect to the sm .",
    "suppression of the @xmath1 couplings occurs naturally in models which mix the neutrinos with heavy gauge singlet states @xcite .",
    "for instance , if the @xmath20 active neutrino @xmath21 is a linear combination of two mass eigenstates with mixing angle @xmath22 , @xmath23 then the @xmath1 coupling will be suppressed by a factor of @xmath24 if the heavy state is too massive to be created in the interaction .",
    "note that the @xmath25 coupling will also be suppressed by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "in general , if the @xmath1 coupling of a particular neutrino flavor is suppressed by a factor of @xmath2 , then the @xmath25 coupling of the same flavor will be suppressed by a factor of @xmath27 . for simplicity , and to preserve lepton universality , assume that the suppression parameter @xmath3 is common to all three generations .",
    "the theoretical values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are reduced by a factor of @xmath2 , since their numerators are suppressed over their denominators , and the invisible width of the @xmath0 is reduced by a factor of @xmath28 . at first glance ,",
    "then , it seems that neutrino mixing may explain both the nutev and invisible width discrepancies .",
    "however , more careful consideration appears to veto this possibility .",
    "one of the inputs used in calculating the sm predictions is the fermi constant @xmath29 , which is extracted from the muon decay constant @xmath30 .",
    "suppression of the @xmath25 couplings leads to the correction @xcite @xmath31 which will affect _ all _ sm predictions .",
    "@xcite concludes that a value of @xmath3 large enough to explain the nutev anomaly would affect the predictions of the sm ( with a conventional light higgs scalar ) to an extent that the excellent agreement between the sm and @xmath0-pole observables would be lost .",
    "notice , though , that the fermi constant @xmath29 always appears multiplied by the @xmath32-parameter in neutral current amplitudes .",
    "thus , the predictions for @xmath0-pole observables will be undisturbed if a shift in @xmath29 is compensated by a shift in @xmath32 .",
    "such shifts can arise via oblique corrections due to new physics @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we perform a fit to the @xmath0-pole and nutev data with the oblique correction parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 as well as the @xmath1 suppression parameter @xmath3 .",
    "oblique corrections alone can not explain the nutev and invisible width discrepancies .",
    "however , fits involving the parameter @xmath3 show excellent agreement with both the @xmath0-pole and nutev data .",
    "the question then , is : `` what physics would account for the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 that allow for a non - zero @xmath3 ? '' a simple ( though perhaps not unique ) solution is the sm itself with a heavy higgs boson .",
    "indeed , we show that if the higgs boson mass is allowed to be large , then the @xmath0-pole and nutev data can be fit by @xmath3 alone .",
    "the preferred value of @xmath3 suggests large mixing angles between the active neutrinos and the heavy sterile states .",
    "this may rule out the seesaw mechanism @xcite as the explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "if the @xmath6 mass is included in the fit , we must also introduce the oblique correction parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the preferred value of @xmath7 is virtually independent of the reference higgs boson mass and can not be supplied within the sm .",
    "we discuss what type of new physics may generate the required value of @xmath7 .",
    ".the correlation matrix of the @xmath0lineshape parameters from lep . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , we perform a fit with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the reference sm is @xmath33 , @xmath34 as before .",
    "the result is @xmath35 the quality of the fit is improved dramatically to @xmath36 for @xmath37 degrees of freedom .",
    "the correlations among the parameters are shown in table  [ stuepscorr ] .",
    "the preferred regions in the @xmath4-@xmath5 , @xmath4-@xmath3 , and @xmath5-@xmath3 planes are shown in figs . 2 through 4 .",
    "the central values have shifted somewhat from our preliminary report in ref .",
    "this is partly due to our use of updated nutev numbers from the third reference of @xcite , and partly due to our use of @xmath38 from ref .",
    "@xcite instead of the zfitter default value of @xmath39 .",
    "thus , by including both oblique corrections and @xmath3 , we obtain an excellent fit to both the @xmath0-pole and nutev data .",
    "but what kind of ` new physics ' would provide such values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ? while the limits on @xmath4 permit it to have either sign , @xmath5 is constrained to be negative by @xmath15 .",
    "few models of new physics are available which predict a negative @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "recall that the effect of a sm higgs heavier than our reference value ( here chosen to be @xmath40 ) is manifested as shifts in the oblique correction parameters .",
    "the approximate expressions for these shifts are @xcite @xmath41 notice that @xmath42 is positive while @xmath43 is negative for @xmath44 . thus increasing the higgs mass",
    "will have the desired effect of providing a negative @xmath5 .",
    "can @xmath5 be made negative enough without making @xmath4 too large ?",
    "the answer is provided in fig .  5 , in which we show a blow up of the central region of fig .  2 .",
    "the sm points fall comfortably within the 90% confidence contour when the higgs mass is even moderately large .      to check that the sm itself is indeed compatible with the data ( excluding the @xmath6 mass ) we perform a fit with only @xmath3 as the fit parameter , and plot the dependence of @xmath45 on the higgs mass used to define the reference sm .",
    "the result is shown is fig .",
    "we also show the @xmath46 dependence of the @xmath47 limits on @xmath3 in fig .",
    "the graphs demonstrate that the data are well fit by a sm with a heavy higgs and a nonzero value of @xmath3 .",
    "we have deliberately excluded the @xmath6 mass from our analysis since it can not be fit with @xmath3 alone , or by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath3 .",
    "( [ s2andmw ] ) suggests that the single parameter fit with @xmath3 , which yields a positive value of @xmath3 , may increase the @xmath6 mass prediction towards the experimental value @xcite .",
    "however , the coefficient of @xmath3 , eq .",
    "( [ stueps ] ) , is too small for it to significantly mitigate the discrepancy .",
    "a three parameter fit with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath3 also fails to close the gap . in that case , note that the combination of @xmath5 and @xmath3 upon which @xmath48 depends is @xmath49 since @xmath50 is pinned by the @xmath0-pole observables , a non - zero @xmath3 would actually lead to a _ decrease _ in the @xmath6 mass prediction .",
    "therefore , the @xmath7 parameter is necessary to fit @xmath48 .",
    "the result of the four parameter fit to the reference sm of @xmath33 , @xmath34 is @xmath51 and the correlations with the other parameters are shown in table  [ stuepscorr ] .",
    "the dependence of these limits on the reference higgs mass @xmath46 is weak , as implied by eq .",
    "( [ higgsstu ] ) and shown in fig .  8 .",
    "we conclude that neutrino mixing together with oblique corrections can reconcile the @xmath0-pole and nutev data .",
    "the simplest model which provides the necessary values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the sm itself with a large higgs boson mass .",
    "we emphasize that there is nothing exotic about this solution .",
    "neutrinos are known to mix from super - kamiokande @xcite , sno @xcite , k2k @xcite , and other neutrino experiments .",
    "neutrino mixing may have the added bonus of contributing negatively to both @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the higgs boson is heavy has also been under scrutiny @xcite since it has not been found in the @xmath52  gev range preferred by the sm global fit ( ref .",
    "@xcite , page 154 ) .",
    "if the higgs boson is indeed heavy as suggested by fig .  6 , it may favor a possible dynamical mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking while providing a challenge for supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the limits on the suppression parameter , @xmath53 imply @xmath54 as the mixing angle if the suppression is due to mixing with a single heavy sterile state .",
    "the heavy state into which the neutrino mixes must be at least as massive as the @xmath0 so that the @xmath0 does not decay into it .",
    "a naive seesaw model @xcite does not permit such a large mixing angle since the angle is related to the ratio of masses .",
    "however , it can be shown that the required pattern of mixings and masses can be arranged when there exist inter - generational mixings @xcite .",
    "we will present explicit examples in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 mass needs the @xmath7 parameter , so we can not do without other new physics entirely .",
    "the higgs mass dependence of the oblique correction parameters are shown in fig .",
    "what kind of new physics will be compatible with this ? it has to predict a small @xmath5 while predicting a large @xmath7 .",
    "one possibility is that the @xmath7 parameter can be enhanced by the formation of bound states at new particle thresholds .",
    "if one expresses @xmath5 and @xmath7 as dispersion integrals over spectral functions , one finds @xmath55\\ ; , \\cr u & \\propto & \\int_{s_\\mathrm{thres}}^\\infty \\frac{ds}{s^2 }                \\left [ \\mathrm{im}\\pi_\\pm(s ) - \\mathrm{im}\\pi_0(s )                \\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite . due to the extra negative power of @xmath56 in the integrand of @xmath7 ,",
    "it is more sensitive to the enhancement of the threshold than @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that threshold effects do not enhance the @xmath5 parameter .",
    "this could , again , mean that a theory that exhibits dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking is favored .",
    "this possibility will be investigated in a subsequent paper .",
