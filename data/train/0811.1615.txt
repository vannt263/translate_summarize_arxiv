    "experiments using ultracold atomic gases have achieved great success in realizing a new type of fermionic superfluid . by arbitrarily varying the strength of interaction via the feshbach resonance , the crossover from the bcs superfluid of fermionic atoms to the bose - einstein condensate of tightly bound molecules",
    "has been observed and extensively studied  @xcite . nowadays",
    "a portion of interests of the cold atom community is shifting to the two - species fermi gas with unequal densities  @xcite and with unequal masses  @xcite . elucidating the phase diagram of such an asymmetric fermi gas is an important and challenging problem .",
    "such an asymmetric system of fermions will be also interesting as a prototype of high density quark matter in the core of neutron stars , where the density and mass imbalances exist among different quark flavors  @xcite .    so far several quantum phases have been proposed as a ground state of the density - imbalanced fermi gas .",
    "one of such phases is the @xmath1-wave superfluid phase by the pairing between the same species of fermions  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the attraction between the same species of fermions was found to be induced by the interaction with the other species of fermions based on the perturbative calculation in the weak - coupling bcs limit .",
    "although the resulting pairing gap is exponentially suppressed in the bcs limit , it may be possible that the pairing gap becomes large enough near the strong - coupling unitarity limit .",
    "thus an important question is how large the pairing gap can be near the unitarity limit .",
    "however , difficulties for theoretical treatments arise away from the weak - coupling bcs limit because we do not have a controlled tool to analyze the strongly interacting many - body system .",
    "monte carlo simulations also have limitations in asymmetric systems due to the fermion sign problem .",
    "we note that in one dimension the monte carlo simulations do not suffer from the sign problem and have been employed to study the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinikov phase in the density - imbalanced fermi gas  @xcite .    in order to obtain further insight into the density - imbalanced fermi gas and the @xmath1-wave pairing therein , we investigate the fermi gas with unequal masses between two different atomic species . in the limit of large mass ratio , we can determine the effective interaction among heavy fermions induced by the interaction with light fermions using the born - oppenheimer approximation . because we do not need to rely on the weak - coupling approximation",
    ", we can go beyond the perturbative bcs regime to the strongly interacting unitary regime in a controlled way .",
    "we will show that the @xmath1-wave projection of the effective interaction between two heavy fermions is attractive in the bcs limit being consistent with the perturbative prediction , while it turns out to be repulsive near the unitarity limit .",
    "thus the @xmath1-wave attraction has a maximum between the bcs and unitarity limits , where the maximal @xmath1-wave pairing of heavy minority fermions is expected .",
    "we note that our results have a direct relevance to the recently realized fermi - fermi mixture of @xmath2 and @xmath3 because of their large mass ratio  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to point it out that the effective interaction among heavy fermions immersed in the fermi sea of light fermions is an analog of the casimir force among objects placed in a vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the casimir force can be traced back to the modification of the spectrum of zero point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field . in our case , the role of vacuum is played by the fermi sea of light fermions whose spectrum is modified by the presence of heavy fermions  @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate a two - species fermi gas with a large mass ratio interacting by an interspecies short - range interaction . using the born - oppenheimer approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the interaction energy of two heavy fermions immersed in the fermi sea of light fermions as a function of the @xmath0-wave scattering length . in the bcs limit </S>",
    "<S> , we recover the perturbative calculation of the effective interaction between heavy fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-wave projection of the effective interaction is attractive in the bcs limit while it turns out to be repulsive near the unitarity limit . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath1-wave attraction reaches its maximum between the bcs and unitarity limits , where the maximal @xmath1-wave pairing of heavy minority fermions is expected . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the case where the heavy fermions are confined in two dimensions and the @xmath1-wave attraction between them is found to be stronger than that in three dimensions . </S>"
