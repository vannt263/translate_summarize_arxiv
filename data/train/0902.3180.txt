    "<S> brown , preston , and singleton ( bps ) produced an analytic calculation for energy exchange processes for a weakly to moderately coupled plasma : the electron - ion temperature equilibration rate and the charged particle stopping power . </S>",

    "<S> we present here the classical limit of the general result for the temperature equilibration rate presented in bps . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we examine the validity of the @xmath0 limit used in bps to obtain a very simple analytic evaluation of the long - distance , collective effects in the background plasma .    </S>",
    "<S> brown , preston , and singleton  @xcite ( bps ) have performed a controlled first principles analytic calculation of coulomb energy exchange processes for weakly to moderately coupled plasmas , namely the electron - ion temperature equilibration rate and the charged particle stopping power . </S>",

    "<S> we shall examine the electron - ion temperature equilibration rate in some detail , particularly with regard to recent molecular dynamics calculations @xcite .    in general , we write the energy density exchange rate between the electrons and ions in a plasma as on the left hand - side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dedteei ] ) , rather than the corresponding temperatures @xmath4 , because , in general , the conversion between @xmath5 and @xmath6 entails higher order plasma corrections in the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> however , as noted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a clean separation into separate electron and ion energy components within the plasma can be made only up to the order @xmath7 to which we work here . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy does not depend upon the coupling @xmath7 , and its time derivative is of order @xmath8 . on the other hand , the potential energy starts at order @xmath9 , and its time derivative is of higher order than we are calculating . at higher orders , collective , </S>",

    "<S> the electron debye wave number @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is sum of the squares of the ion plasma frequencies . throughout this paper </S>",
    "<S> we shall measure temperature in energy units .    for plasma conditions that often occur in icf capsules , the coupling @xmath7 is weak to moderate and </S>",
    "<S> the electron temperature @xmath15 is much greater than the binding energy @xmath16 of the hydrogen atom , @xmath17 . since @xmath18 </S>",

    "<S> thus , for these icf conditions , the quantum parameter is small , @xmath20 , which corresponds formally to @xmath21 being large , and so the scattering must be described quantum mechanically . </S>",
    "<S> the electron mass @xmath22 is much smaller than an ion mass @xmath23 in the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> taking advantage of @xmath24 , bps made use of a sum rule for the contributions of collective long - distance effects in the @xmath25 limit and were able to find a simple expression for the coulomb logarithm under these conditions : @xmath26 \\ , , \\label{bpsrateqm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the euler constant , and @xmath28 is the electron plasma frequency . </S>",

    "<S> molecular dynamic ( md ) methods@xcite have been used to extend such perturbative results into non - perturbative regimes . </S>",
    "<S> however , most md methods employ ad - hoc potentials that mock up quantum - mechanical effects in a fashion that has little theoretical basis . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , even in the perturbative regime , it is problematic to compare such md results with the result of a systematic calculation such as that given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bpsrateqm ] ) . to surmount this problem , dimonte and daligault@xcite ( dd ) </S>",
    "<S> have recently performed purely classical   md simulations with the coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> the md simulations of dd give results that can be directly compared with the classical limit of the bps calculation . as with the extreme quantum limit ( [ bpsrateqm ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , for light electrons the classical result also takes a simple form , @xmath29 this expression follows from adding terms ( 12.25 ) and ( 12.44 ) of bps , except for the trivial modification to ordinary gaussian units from the rationalized electrostatic units employed by ref .  @xcite . here , </S>",

    "<S> , the classical bps result can be written as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the plasma coupling , and @xmath34  . </S>",
    "<S> for small values of @xmath35 , the regime in which the bps formalism is valid , dd have found agreement with expression ( [ mezerolc ] ) to within their statistical error of 5% .    to avoid the formation of unstable configurations of two particles of opposite charge that experience an attractive force , dd work with electrons and ions of the same charge moving in an implicit neutralizing background charge density of opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> since it is either the square or the absolute value of the electron and ion charges that enter into the perturbative regime , as made explicit by the expressions ( [ rate ] ) and ( [ mezerolc ] ) , this sign change causes no problem for small coupling   becomes of order one or larger , the relative sign of the electron and ion charges is important . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the first correction to the perturbative results quoted in the text has an overall coefficient involving @xmath36 that is negative in the physical case . </S>",
    "<S> this is experimentally confirmed in the differing ranges of positive and negative pi mesons stopping in nuclear emulsions @xcite . ] . to increase the speed of convergence of the simulations , dd use an ` electron ' mass @xmath22 and a single species of ` ion ' mass </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 whose ratio is on the order of 1/100 rather than the physical value of 1/1836 for the electron and proton . </S>",
    "<S> this larger choice of electron - ion mass ratio allows them to obtain accurate numerical results with high statistics , and it in no way alters the relevance of their work in testing analytic results for which this mass ratio can be changed at will . </S>",
    "<S> however , to properly compare with bps in this mass regime , one must now include finite electron mass corrections to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mezerolc ] ) . some are trivial kinematic corrections . </S>",
    "<S> others , which we shall denote by @xmath37 , arise from long distance collective effects and are non - trivial . </S>",
    "<S> for the parameter regime considered in dd @xcite , we shall find that these corrections are less than their 5% statistical error .    before turning to the calculation of the electron mass corrections for the classical case , </S>",
    "<S> we note that the extreme quantum limit  ( [ bpsrateqm ] ) contains exactly the same non - trivial long distance correction @xmath37 , in addition to other trivial kinematic corrections . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the calculation in the text is also relevant for the extreme quantum case . for plasmas in the icf regime , these corrections </S>",
    "<S> may be of comparable size to the degeneracy corrections   calculated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . to have a place in which all the small corrections to the quantum limit ( [ bpsrateqm ] ) are collected , we quote results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> these entail not only the first fermi - dirac correction when the electron density starts to become large , but also the first classical correction when the quantum parameter @xmath38 starts to become large . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we shall have a convenient reference to all of our results on the energy relaxation rate relevant to icf recorded in the appendix .    to begin our development , we note that the work of bps @xcite expresses the coefficient appearing in eq .  </S>",
