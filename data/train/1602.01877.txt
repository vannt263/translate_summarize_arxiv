    "v582 mon , more commonly known as kh 15d , is a binary system located in the @xmath13 myr old open cluster ngc 2264 at a distance of 760 pc @xcite .",
    "the object was included in a survey of young variable objects and noted because of the unusual depth and duration of its strictly periodic brightness variations @xcite , which were later found to be evolving in a manner never before seen in any astronomical object @xcite .",
    "models of the system @xcite explained its behavior by placing two stars at the center of a warped , rigidly precessing ring of material that roughly stretches from @xmath11 - 5 au .",
    "see figure [ cartoon ] for a sketch of the geometry .",
    "the projection of the circumbinary ring on the sky creates an opaque , sharp - edged screen , and the system brightens and fades as the stars appear to  rise \" and  set \" at its edge .",
    "spectral analysis confirmed that kh 15d is a binary with an orbital period of 48.37 days @xcite . the orbital period is equal to the period over which the observed light from the system varies on the short term , confirming that the motion of the stars causes the eclipses .",
    "both components are classified as weak - lined t tauri stars ( wtts ) , based on the system s h-@xmath2 equivalent width of 2 @xmath3 at maximum light @xcite .",
    "however , the strength of the h-@xmath2 line increases to 40 @xmath3 at mid - eclipse and 60 @xmath3 at egress .",
    "the system is also still actively accreting , as evidenced by a bipolar jet @xcite and forbidden emission lines @xcite . analyzing the structure and composition of the circumbinary ring",
    "may shed light generally on the earliest stages of terrestrial planet formation in low mass stars , particularly low mass binaries .",
    "the inner radius of the dust ring is presumably truncated sharply by the time variable gravitational potential of the binary , although gas gets through to cause accretion and jet activity .",
    "why and how the ring is truncated at its outer edge is less clear .",
    "color excesses in _ i - j _ and _ i - h _ have been detected , and the amount of excess is consistent with the flux expected from a @xmath11 myr - old , 10 @xmath4 planet @xcite . if spectroscopically confirmed , this could be the signature of a shepherding planet that constrains the ring s outer radius .",
    "regardless of what truncates it , the ring precesses rigidly @xcite , causing the system s eclipse properties to vary as the screen covers different portions of the binary orbit over time @xcite .",
    "the less massive star ( star a ) was the only visible component from 1995 - 2009 and emerged from behind the screen at each apastron passage during that era .",
    "both stars were covered from 2009 to 2011 , but the trailing edge of the screen began to uncover the orbit of the brighter companion ( star b ) at apastron passages during late 2011 , while star a remained completely hidden @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present two more observing seasons ( 2013 - 2015 ) of optical and near - ir photometry covering a period of continued unveiling of star b and , therefore , brightening of the system at all phases , most noticeably at maximum light .",
    "we also present infrared data from the spitzer space telescope at several epochs from 2004 - 2013 and covering all phases of the orbital cycle , to extend our analysis of the system s properties to longer wavelengths .",
    "we compare the spitzer magnitudes with the optical data at the appropriate epoch to determine if the ring remains optically thick at these wavelengths and to search for excess emission from the ring , disk or putative giant planet .",
    "light curves in the _ vrijh _ bands have shown eclipse depths of @xmath54 magnitudes , indicating sharp attenuation of starlight by the ring material even near its edge .",
    "the system s _ vrijh _ colors show no reddening as star b  sets \" .",
    "in fact , the colors at these wavelengths become somewhat bluer as the star disappears completely , a feature we attribute to forward scattering by grains of a size similar to the wavelength of light @xcite .",
    "although little is known about the nature of the material itself , polarization measurements indicate nearly achromatic scattering and suggest a population of grains with a size on the order of @xmath510 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "we first discuss the latest developments in the evolving light curve , as well as our interpretation of the spitzer photometry .",
    "we also emphasize the spitzer data reduction process , in which careful correction for contamination by diffracted light from ngc 2264 irs1 and emission from the inner jet of the system is required .",
    "this paper benefitted enormously from the fact that kh 15d was included in the fields monitored during the  coordinated synoptic investigation of ngc 2264 \" ( csi 2264 ) program @xcite , providing us with very high cadence data over a 28-day span in dec .",
    "2011 , which coincided with a partial egress , bright phase , and partial ingress of star b.",
    "we have continued to obtain ground - based optical and near - infrared photometry over the last two years using a novel dual imaging camera ( andicam ) on the 1.3 m telescope at cerro - tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile .",
    "the instrument is operated by the smarts consortium .",
    "data were collected almost nightly from october 2013 through april 2014 .",
    "observations were resumed in september 2014 and continued until april 2015 .",
    "each night , four 150 s exposures were obtained in each of the three optical bands @xmath6 along with 10 - 15 dithered exposures ( 30 s each ) in the near - infrared bands @xmath7 .",
    "all images have a 10.2@xmath8 x 10.2@xmath8 field of view .",
    "the data acquisition and reduction processes are discussed briefly in appendix a , and a more complete description is given by @xcite . the @xmath9 magnitudes from the last two observing seasons",

    "details are given in table [ spitzsummary ] , and all data sets are now publicly available through the spitzer heritage archive .",
    "the first four were obtained between 2004 and 2006 , when the orbital path of star b was still completely occulted at all phases and star a was mostly or entirely visible during each apastron passage .",
    "these observations were conducted during the so - called  cryogenic \" period , when irac could be sufficiently cooled to return images from all four of its detectors ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "although each of these data sets was reduced at the time it was first obtained by the pis , the photometry was difficult to interpret because the background flux is comparable to the signal from kh 15d .",
    "results have therefore not been previously published .",
    "irac had exhausted its supply of liquid helium coolant by the time the last two sets of spitzer images were collected .",
    "these data only cover 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m , since the shorter wavelength detectors do not require operating temperatures to be as low as their longer wavelength counterparts @xcite .",
    "the fifth set of observations was obtained by the csi 2264 team as part of a large campaign to monitor young variable objects in ngc 2264 @xcite .",
    "these data were obtained over 28 consecutive days of observation in december 2011 , when star a was completely hidden from view at all phases and star b was partly visible during each apastron passage . in the high cadence csi 2264 monitoring program ,",

    "a final set of observations was proposed to fill in the gaps in phase space in the 2011 photometry , although the new data would be collected at a much lower cadence .",
    "images were obtained on eight nights between december 2013 and january 2014 . a larger fraction of star b was directly visible at apastron by then , although its surface was still partially occulted .",
    "these observations covered the central eclipse as well as parts of egress and maximum light .",
    "it was found that all of the spitzer data needed to be reduced with care due to the faintness of the source , especially near periastron passage , compared to contaminating light from two sources  diffraction spikes from the nearby intense source ngc 2264 irs1 and the inner jet .",
    "the magnitude of the problem is illustrated in figure [ brightfaint ] , which shows a 3.6 @xmath0 m spitzer image of the source near maximum brightness and minimum brightness .",
    "our procedure for dealing with the complex background emission is discussed in appendix b. the full set of spitzer photometry at all epochs is given in table [ spitzerdata ] .",

    "figure [ longterm ] places the @xmath9 observations from the last two years in the context of the long - term evolution of the system .",
    "we are in a period where the system continues to get brighter at maximum light as more and more of the photosphere of star b ( the brighter star in the system ) is revealed during each apastron passage . @xcite predicted that kh 15d would continue to brighten over time and that it would spend increasingly longer time intervals in its bright state as the trailing edge of the occulting screen uncovered more of the orbital path of star b. in figure [ expandedlightcurve ] , we show the last five years of data covering the period of full or almost full emergence of star b. it is clear that the peak magnitude of the system has , in fact , brightened steadily during these observing seasons , confirming our basic understanding of the system .",
    "does star b , in fact , fully emerge now at its brightest or is it still at least partially occulted all of the time ?",
    "the value for the system s expected i - band magnitude when star b is fully emerged can be estimated from the magnitude determined from archival plates obtained between 1965 and 1990 @xcite , when both stars were directly visible at maximum light ( @xmath10 mag ; winn et al .",
    "2006 ) , and ccd measurements obtained when star a alone was unocculted @xmath11 .",
    "this method predicts a peak brightness for the system when star b is fully emerged of of @xmath12 @xcite . if this is correct , star b is fully emerged , and we would expect no further increase in brightness of the system near maximum light until both stars become visible at some orbital phase .",
    "however , an additional constraint on the unocculted brightness of star b is the photometry obtained at vvo in 1996 , when star b was emerging from behind the leading edge of the screen at periastron .",
    "the magnitude of the system was measured at @xmath13 at this time @xcite , which is somewhat brighter than the expected value based on the archival data .",
    "if the single periastron measurement is a better guide , then we may see some additional brightening of the star next season . at this point",
    "we can say that star b is either fully emerging or nearly fully emerging during each orbital cycle .    in either case",
    "it is important to note the overall symmetry of the long - term kh 15d light curve ( see figure [ longterm ] ) .",
    "the radii of stars a and b must be nearly the same , based on their similar brightnesses and temperatures .",
    "the fact that the time to cover star a is turning out to be about the same as the time to uncover star b ( @xmath14 years ) therefore indicates that the sky projections of the leading and trailing edges of the obscuring ring move at the same rate . taking the radius of star a to be 1.3 r@xmath14 @xcite and the time to traverse it as 4 years indicates a velocity across the sky for the projected edge of about 15 m s@xmath15 .",
    "such a slow , stable progression of both leading and trailing edges is indicative of rigid precession of a ring , as has been assumed now for more than a decade .",
    "we return to the ring precession time scale in section 4 .      although figures [ longterm ] and [ expandedlightcurve ] show that kh 15d has steadily been getting brighter each year , the behavior of the light curve is not perfectly uniform among individual cycles . the increase in brightness does not appear to progress at exactly the same rate from cycle - to - cycle and the shapes of the maxima are not always identical .",
    "for example , during the 2013 - 14 observing season , the system got brighter during each of the first three cycles but dimmed by 0.04 mag during the last cycle .",
    "the peak magnitude was fainter still for the first two cycles of the 2014 - 15 season before brightening again by 0.05 mag during each of the last two cycles .",
    "the non - uniformity of the cycle - to - cycle light curves could be explained by the presence of hills and valleys located along the occulting edge of the circumbinary ring .",
    "alternatively , cool spots on the surface of star b could sometimes result in less observed flux than expected at peak brightness .",
    "if cool spots are the reason for the deviations , we can expect to see redder colors during the cycles when the system became dimmer .",
    "clumps within the ring , on the other hand , would not cause color changes during maximum light , unless they were less opaque at the andicam wavelengths than the bulk of the ring material .",
    "the amount of reddening at maximum light could , therefore , make it possible to distinguish between spots and clumps as the source of the variations .",
    "@xcite found that changes in _ v _ and _ i _ magnitudes caused by cool spots on t tauri stars followed the relation d__v__/d__i__@xmath16 .",
    "for a _ v _ band variation of 0.03 mag , we can expect a 0.02 mag change in _",
    "i _ and a color change of @xmath17 . between the third and fourth cycles of the 2013 - 2014 observing season , when the system became 0.03 mag fainter in _ v _ at maximum light , the _ v - i _ color at peak brightness reddened by 0.03 mag .",
    "the difference in color between the first two cycles in 2014 - 2015 was @xmath18 mag when the peak _ v _ mag again became 0.03 mag fainter .",
    "although our observations are consistent with what we would expect for a spotted stellar surface , the _ v _ band fluctuations are nt large enough to result in significant color changes .",
    "the color changes are around the same size as the photometric errors in the data , making it difficult to confirm that the reddening is real .",
    "the reddening of the _ v - i _ and _ r - i _ colors between the 2013 - 2014 and 2014 - 2015 data can be attributed to the continued rise of star b. as more of its surface is revealed during the bright phase , more of its light is directly visible and dominates the contribution from the bluer , forward scattered light .",
    "in addition to the cycle - to - cycle variations in the system s brightness at maximum light , the shape of the light curve at mid - eclipse also varies between cycles ( see figure [ expandedlightcurve ] ) .",
    "a few show a bump in the light curve at mid - eclipse , but the shape of the bump is not consistent with the mid - eclipse re - brightenings observed when star a was directly visible at apastron and star b approached the leading edge of the screen at periastron .",
    "the slight increases in brightness are not significant when compared to the amount of scatter present in the photometry at minimum light , indicating that scattered light from star a as it approaches the trailing edge of the screen near periastron is not yet contributing significantly to the system s brightness .",
    "a likely cause of variations near mid - eclipse is stellar activity associated with the close periapse passage of the two stars , which have a fairly eccentric ( e = 0.6 ) orbit . @xcite",
    "have discussed the spectral evidence for increased activity at perihelion passage when the stars are separated by only @xmath115 stellar radii and their magnetospheres may well interact .",
    "the color behavior of the kh 15d system as a function of brightness is shown in figures [ andicam_cmd ] and [ vk_cmd_full ] .",
    "focusing first on the shorter wavelengths , out to h , we see a fairly simple and consistent behavior . at its brightest levels , the light from the system is dominated by photospheric emission from the unocculted portion of star b , and the colors approach values expected for a k1 pre - main sequence star that suffers only a small amount of foreground reddening , @xmath19 mag .",
    "as the system fades due to the setting of star b , scattered light becomes more and more important .",
    "just after  star set , \" the light is dominated by forward scattered light off of the ring .",
    "the system has a @xmath20 magnitude of about 18 at this point .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ andicam_cmd ] that the color of the scattered light becomes progressively bluer with respect to the photosphere as one moves to longer wavelength baselines .",
    "this causes an increasingly large",
    " tilt \" of the color - magnitude curves in the bright phase ( @xmath20 @xmath21 18 ) .",
    "we attribute the blueness of the scattered light to mie scattering off of grains with sizes comparable to the wavelength of the light they are scattering ; this is supported by a forward scattering model , presented in section 4.2 of this paper .",
    "since there is actually very little or no bluing of the light at optical wavelengths , it is apparent that the size of the grains must be much larger than is characteristic of the interstellar medium .",
    "the scattering material is much  greyer \" than the ism and is roughly characterized by k@xmath22 .",
    "this nearly achromatic scattering agrees with the results of @xcite , based on spectropolarimetry of the system .",
    "figure [ expandedlightcurve ] shows that there is significantly more scatter in the _ k _ band photometry at minimum light than in the other five andicam bands .",
    "@xcite identified a detection limit of @xmath23 mag due to residual flat - fielding errors and used a smaller aperture for the _ k _ band photometry than for the _ j _ and _ h _ data in order to correct for the lower s / n . bands _ v _ through _",
    "h _ show that kh 15d has now become slightly brighter at all phases since the 2010 - 2013 photometry was collected , making it brighter than @xmath23 mag during minimum light in the more recent data .",
    "if the amount of scatter is a true feature of the _ k _ band light curve , the ring material could be somewhat more transparent here than at shorter wavelengths .",
    "figure [ vk_cmd_full ] shows that the 2014 - 2015 _ v - k _ color becomes slightly redder as the system gets fainter , unlike at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the trend reverses around @xmath24 , as the system returns to the bluer color it showed at peak brightness .",
    "this is in contrast to the _ v - j _ and _ v - h _ colors ( see figure [ andicam_cmd ] ) , which steadily become bluer as star b sets behind the screen and only redden at minimum light .",
    "the reddening in the _ k _ band implies that the opacity of the ring material is lower at @xmath25 m than at shorter wavelengths .",
    "it is also notable that , as we discuss below , there is clear evidence of a similar reddening occurring at the spitzer wavelengths . as a caution",
    ", we do note that this is the first observing season since _ k _ band observations of kh 15d began in 2011 that such reddening has been detected .",
    "we do not have sufficient data to compare the current _ v - k _ color to the color of the system when star a was the directly visible component and reached a similar peak brightness , but the reddening should be monitored in future observing seasons as the geometry of the system continues to evolve with respect to our line of sight .",
    "it could be that our line of sight through the occulting material is leading to a somewhat lower optical depth as time progresses .",
    "finally , we note that there are some rather aberrant points visible on the color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "we have carefully examined the images on nights when these were detected and could find no reason to exclude the data .",
    "therefore , we have left them on figures [ andicam_cmd ] and [ vk_cmd_full ] .",
    "they are particularly noticeable at @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 wavelengths .",
    "it is possible that these are merely accidental photometric errors of some sort , but they could also be actual variations of the system color related to the non - uniformity of the absorbing screen .",
    "not wishing to remove data simply because it does not fit a pattern , we have left those data in the tables and on the figures .",
    "the spitzer photometry was obtained at three distinct epochs , which is evident from the shapes of the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m phased light curves ( figure [ spitzerphasefold ] ) .",
    "star a was the only stellar component that was directly visible at the time the 2004 - 2006 observations were conducted , and its entire surface was unocculted at maximum brightness near apastron .",
    "the resulting light curves indicate a shorter eclipse duration and a sharper egress than the other two data sets .",
    "the system also rose to a flat maximum , corresponding to those phases when star a was fully visible .",
    "star b began to emerge by 2011 , when the system was observed by the csi 2264 team , although only a small portion of the star was directly visible .",
    "the eclipse duration was longer than it was between 2004 and 2006 , and the magnitude at maximum brightness was fainter .",
    "the fraction of star b that was uneclipsed had increased substantially by the time the 2013 - 2014 data were collected , corresponding to an increase in peak brightness .",
    "egress was noticeably sharper in the 2011 data but not as abrupt as it was in the 2004 - 2006 photometry .",
    "it was also evident that the full eclipse duration had shortened , although it was still longer than it had been from 2004 - 2006 .",
    "the eclipse depth is more difficult to determine at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m than at shorter wavelengths because of the large amount of scatter in the photometry obtained at minimum light .",
    "however , the system had an approximately 3.5 mag decline in brightness over the orbital period during 2011 and 2013 - 2014 .",
    "this is consistent with the eclipse depth observed in the _ vrijhk _ bands during those years .",
    "the eclipse depth may have been deeper at 3.6 @xmath0 m between 2004 and 2006 , although this is only based on two data points with high uncertainties .",
    "the similar eclipse depths at all wavelengths indicates that even at 4.5 @xmath0 m , the ring remains optically thick near central eclipse .    during the csi 2264 campaign ,",
    "high cadence spitzer photometry was obtained during part of one egress , maximum brightness , and most of one ingress .",
    "@xmath29 band photometry was also obtained at ctio , often within half a day of the dates on which spitzer data were collected . by phasing data from the cycle before and the cycle after the spitzer campaign , it was possible to fill out the @xmath29 light curves very well .",
    "figure [ ysovar ] shows the resulting light curves for that orbital cycle .",
    "it is quite evident that the shape of the light curve at spitzer wavelengths is rather different from the shape at ground - based wavelengths . in particular ,",
    "the system brightens a little earlier and more rapidly , and then remains brighter for a substantially longer period of time , beginning its rapid descent ( ingress ) about two days later than was the case at @xmath29 wavelengths .",
    "we interpret this to mean that the ring edge is somewhat transparent at spitzer wavelengths , allowing us to see a bit more photospheric emission for a bit longer than at shorter wavelengths .",
    "there is more transparency during ingress , indicating that the effect is not identical between ingress and egress .",
    "these results can be further illustrated by color - magnitude diagrams based on the @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 $ ] colors calculated through interpolation between phase measurements on the i - band light curves .",
    "figure [ modelcmd ] shows how the @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 $ ] colors behave as kh 15d becomes fainter .",
    "the system becomes distinctly redder between peak brightness and @xmath32 mag , when star b is fully occulted , before returning to a bluer color .",
    "this is much different from the _ vijh _ colors , which get bluer due to the scattered light contribution until the phase when star b is fully occulted .",
    "the reddening implies that some 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m starlight is able to get through the edge of the ring material before the screen becomes fully opaque at some height below the edge of the ring . in other words ,",
    "the edge of the ring is partially transparent to spitzer wavelengths .",
    "we note that it was also apparently partially transparent at k in the last observing season .",
    "the difference between ingress and egress in the csi 2264 data is quite apparent .",
    "the line of sight through the ring has a different geometry during ingress and egress , owing to the different locations of star b in its orbit .",
    "this difference presumably accounts for the fact that the csi 2264 ingress appears to be a little more transparent than the csi 2264 egress .",
    "similar trends , indicating partial transparency of the ring edge of variable amounts depending on the phase and cycle , are suggested in the data from 2004 - 2006 , but the relatively sparse sampling of the light curve at those epochs makes it difficult to analyze . the color behavior of the system during the 2011 observing run , from which we have very high cadence data , will be discussed in more detail in section 4 .",
    "the spitzer data obtained during the 2004 - 2006 epoch can be combined with ground - based measurements to construct a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the system when star a is fully visible and star b fully occulted .",
    "this is useful for comparing kh 15d to other ctts and wtts , which we never get to observe with a reduced contribution from starlight .",
    "disk emission is sufficiently strong in ctts that it appears in the sed of the system at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "table [ sedtable ] shows the magnitudes adopted for the sed , as well as the extinction corrections applied .",
    "they are based on the average brightness of the system at maximum light during the period 2004 - 2006 , as summarized in table [ vrijhkdata ] , the @xmath33 bright phase measurements by @xcite during that era , and the spitzer photometry obtained at the bright phase from table [ spitzerdata ] .",
    "the extinction correction is based on the assumption of foreground reddening with a normal extinction law characterized by @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the scattered light from star b should have only a minor effect on the sed at this time , and any light from a putative luminous giant planet would be totally negligible .",
    "figure [ sed ] shows the bright phase sed for kh 15d when star a was fully visible . for comparison ,",
    "we show seds for three k7 wttss in ngc 2264 from the data compiled by @xcite .",
    "there is moderately good agreement among these .",
    "if anything , kh 15d shows less emission in the near - ir , particularly at @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] . perhaps this is related to the binary nature of our object , but the discrepancy is relatively small in light of the difficulties of obtaining accurate photometry as described above .",
    "the main point , we believe , is that there is no evidence for near - ir disk emission in the bright phase sed of kh 15d .",
    "it is consistent with the previous classification of the star as a class iii ( wtts ) object based on its bright phase h@xmath2 equivalent width @xcite .",

    "its color index of @xmath35 - [ 8.0 ] = 0.13 $ ] is also well below the limit of 0.4 adopted by @xcite and @xcite to identify sources with disk emission .",
    "while the conventional interpretation of a source with this kind of sed is that it is  diskless , \" kh 15d is an excellent reminder that this is a poor choice of words .",

    "hopefully this situation can be clarified in the near future with alma observations .",
    "@xcite predict that the source will have excess emission in the 10 - 100 @xmath0 m range coming from the occulting inner ring / disk , but observational attempts to confirm this have so far been unsuccessful because of confusion in the region around kh 15d .",

    "this makes it even more remarkable and fortuitous that we have been able to observe the phenomena associated with this system during the present era .",
    "we have made a first attempt at comparing the photometric data gathered with andicam to the  fuzzy - edge \" ring model described in @xcite .",
    "they assumed that the edge of the ring has an optical depth due to dust that varies as a power - law with distance , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the scale - length of the edge of the ring and @xmath60 is the sky - projected position perpendicular to the edge of the ring .",

    "we use this model to attempt to explain the color behavior as a function of the flux level ; we do not attempt to fit the entire light curve , as this would require revisiting the dynamical model of the system , which we leave to future work .",
    "the three parameters we vary for each wavelength are : @xmath65 , @xmath62 , and @xmath66 ( the ratio of forward scattering to large - angle scattering / absorption ) .",
    "we have only attempted to fit the @xmath20 and @xmath26 band data as these are well separated in wavelength , but are still short enough wavelength that the grey approximation might still apply .",

    "figure [ v_vs_vmj ] shows the color - magnitude measurements and the best - fit model .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table [ forward_scat ] ( while other parameters were held fixed at the @xmath61-band values from @xcite ) .",

    "the model does a fair job at reproducing the color variation as a function of wavelength , as shown in figure [ v_vs_vmj ] .",
    "as the star sets behind the edge , the shorter wavelengths have a narrower and taller forward - scattering peak , causing the sum of the transmitted and forward - scattered flux to first become blue , as shown in figure [ flux_vs_distance ] .",

    "a simple model suggests that the ratio of 3.6 @xmath0 m to 4.5 @xmath0 m opacity is about 1.04 , consistent with extinction by large grains and smaller than the value of 1.25 expected for a @xmath129 law such as applies in the interstellar medium .",
    "similar transparency may also be visible in the latest season of @xmath28-band photometry , but additional data are needed to confirm this .",
    "it is clear that the opacity of the ring edge can change even between an ingress and egress of the same cycle , presumably due to the different geometry caused by the stellar orbit in relation to the ring .",
    "observations of dust in protoplanetary disks are normally carried out at much longer wavelengths than 2.2 , 3.6 , and 4.5 @xmath0 m and provide information about cooler grains much further out from the star than is the case for kh 15d .",

    "this difference was simply [ f]-[c ] for the optical reference stars , where [ f ] and [ c ] denote the measured magnitudes of reference stars f and c , respectively , on a given night . for the near - infrared reference stars ,",
    "differences were calculated with respect to star 4 ( e.g. [ 1]-[4 ] ) .",
    "we then calculated the standard deviation , @xmath130 , of the data to quantify the night - to - night fluctuations in the magnitudes of the comparison stars .",
    "the resulting values are listed in tables [ vrierrors ] and [ jhkerrors ] .",
    "we found that the standard deviations were much less than 0.1 mag for most of the reference stars , making the differential photometry done with these calibrators a reliable way to determine the magnitude of kh 15d .",
    "however , star 2 showed more scatter than the others over both observing seasons .",
    "while the deviations were nt large enough for us to discard star 2 as a calibrator , its stability should be checked in future observing seasons .",

    "photometry on the data from 2004 - 2006 was originally done by scott allen , a visiting reu student from vassar college , who found that the background near kh 15d showed too much variation to obtain reliable aperture photometry . instead of calculating an average background value",
    ", he fit a polynomial to the background to determine how it varied as a function of pixel .",
    "while the internal consistency of the results was much improved , overall , the data set was too sparse at that time to facilitate interpretation of the results .",
    "the high - cadence data from the 2011 observational run were processed by rob gutermuth of the csi 2264 team .",
    "gutermuth used his own method to create mosaics from the original images , instead of using those produced by the spitzer pipeline @xcite .",
    "the program photvis was used to determine the magnitude of kh 15d through aperture photometry .",
    "an aperture radius of 2 pixels was chosen , with a sky annulus extending from the edge of the aperture to 6 pixels from its center @xcite .",
    "these photometric results are included in the catalogue of photometry produced by the csi 2264 team , and kh 15d is identified as csimon-001370 in that work .",
    "photometry for the 2013/14 data was initially done by us directly on the mosaics from the spitzer pipeline , using the iraf _ phot _ commands .",
    "we chose an aperture radius of 10 pixels and a sky annulus that extended a distance of 12 - 20 pixels from kh 15d , as suggested in the irac instrument handbook .",
    "the results we obtained for the 2013/14 images were similar to what was reported by gutermuth from the 2011 observations .",
    "both resulting light curves had eclipse depths much shallower than observed at shorter wavelengths , but visual inspection of the images indicated that obvious contamination by the inner filamentry jet identified by @xcite and the diffraction spikes from ngc 2264 irs1 had to be corrected for before any conclusions could be reached . both of these contaminating sources are extended along the north - south direction and stronger on the north side of the source ( see figure [ brightfaint ] ) .",
    "while these bright background sources were only present on one side of the sky annulus we selected in iraf , some of their light spilled over into part of the kh 15d aperture as well .",
    "the _ phot _",
    "command removes the background from the source aperture by subtracting the median value of counts per pixel within the sky annulus , which in this case led to an underestimate of the background at the northern edge of the aperture .",
    "_ phot _ rejects outliers when calculating the median sky brightness and is typically very reliable .",
    "however , the contamination was so severe and asymmetric in this case that a better method of sky subtraction was required to obtain more accurate photometry .    instead of calculating a median value of the background within some annulus and subtracting the same level of noise from every pixel , we used an approach similar to allen s method and determined how the sky brightness varied across the aperture . for each mosaic , we first extracted two copies of a 40 x 40 pixel box with kh 15d at its center .",
    "a 10 x 10 pixel square , including the star itself , was removed entirely from the center of the second box .",
    "we performed a linear interpolation across each row of the ",
    "empty \" square to estimate the amount of background flux as a function of @xmath132 pixel location .",
    "the interpolation was done in the north - south direction to match the orientation of the contaminating features in the images .",
    "the center of the image was filled in based on the background values determined by the interpolation .",
    "the entire 40 x 40 pixel box was subtracted from the first copy , which still contained kh 15d at its center .",
    "the system s total flux was calculated by summing over all pixels within a 6 x 6 pixel aperture centered on the source in the background - subtracted image .",
    "we tested the background interpolation for several different dimensions of the ",
    "empty \" box and found that the resulting photometry was dependent on the parameters we selected for its size .",
    "the strength of the contaminating filament increased the further north we looked from kh 15d , so a box larger than 10 x 10 pixels would have more flux at its edge than would be encompassed in the final aperture .",
    "this would result in an overestimate of the background in the central pixel once the box was filled in with the interpolated sky brightness .",
    "the lower limit on the size of the box was set by the fwhm of kh 15d .",
    "a smaller box would allow pixels containing starlight to be included in the interpolation , again resulting in excess sky subtraction .",
    "figure [ skycomp ] compares our method of sky subtraction to the _ phot _ method for an image taken during the faint phase , when the contrast between kh 15d and the background was lowest .",
    "we can see that a significant amount of flux is leftover on the north side of the aperture after subtracting a median background value from each pixel .",
    "the residual sky contribution was better removed when we applied the interpolation method instead .",
    "we are therefore confident that our sky subtraction method sets a more accurate level for the background contamination in each image than the iraf aperture photometry .",
    "figure [ lightcurvecomp_new ] compares our photometry with that provided in the csi 2264 data base .",
    "one can see the offset that arises because of our correction for the asymmetric background contamination .",
    "as expected , the offset grows dramatically as the star fades , resulting in a much greater eclipse depth from our photometry .",
    "after correction for background contamination we measure an eclipse depth of @xmath14 mag , which is consistent with observations at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we applied our background subtraction method to all of the images obtained with spitzer at all epochs for consistency . for the 2011 images from the csi 2264 team",
    ", we found that the mosaicking procedure adopted by gutermuth produced images with slightly lower angular resolution per pixel than those compiled by the spitzer pipeline .",
    "although this did nt have a noticeable effect during the bright phase , it increased the uncertainty in the faint phase photometry .",
    "hence , we acquired the original spitzer mosaics and obtained photometry from those instead , using the procedure described above .",
