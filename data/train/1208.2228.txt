    "knowing the classical geometry hiding behind a quantum system provides many insights into its behavior @xcite . in this paper",
    "we introduce semiclassical methods to investigate the main feature of loop gravity : the prediction of a quantum discreteness of the volume of space @xcite .",
    "we focus on an elementary 4-valent grain of space and derive the semiclassical spectrum of the volume exploiting knowledge of the classical system associated to it  a euclidean tetrahedron .",
    "this analysis develops the bohr - sommerfeld quantization of space introduced in @xcite and provides a new approximation scheme that can be tested against the numerical results of @xcite .",
    "moreover , the semiclassical geometries that arise give new insights into the scaling of the spectrum in a variety of limits .",
    "+ in loop gravity @xcite quantum states are built on a spin colored graph .",
    "the nodes of this graph represent three dimensional grains of space and the links of the graph encode the adjacency of these regions .",
    "traditionally @xcite the quantum volume of a region of space @xmath0 is obtained by regularizing and quantizing the classical expression @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the metric of space .",
    "the total volume is obtained by summing the contributions from each node of the spin colored graph contained in the region @xmath0 . due to the necessity of a regularization scheme",
    "there are different proposals for the volume operator at a node .",
    "the operator originally proposed by rovelli and smolin @xcite is @xmath3 where @xmath4 are electric - flux operators associated to each link of the graph impinging on the node , @xmath5 is a multiplicative constant , and the sum over @xmath6 spans triples of links at the node .",
    "a second operator introduced by ashtekar and lewandowski @xcite is @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the tangents to the links of the spin network graph @xmath9 embedded in the space @xmath10-manifold .",
    "the @xmath11 are signs , @xmath12 or @xmath13 corresponding to whether the triple of tangents is right handed , left handed or planar respectively . when @xmath14 is viewed as an operator on the intertwiner hilbert space associated to the node , the tangents @xmath8 and the signs @xmath15 have to be understood as external fixed data .",
    "this residual dependence on the embedding of the spin network graph plays an important role in the definition of thiemann s regularization of the hamiltonian constraint @xcite .",
    "both the rovelli - smolin and the ashtekar - lewandowski proposals , defined here on the node hilbert space , admit classical versions : we dequantize the operators @xmath16 to obtain vectors @xmath17 .",
    "this results in two distinct functions on phase space @xmath18    recently , a third proposal for the volume operator at a node has emerged @xcite . motivated by the geometry of the minkowski theorem , bianchi ,",
    "don and speziale suggest the promotion of the classical volume of the polyhedron associated to @xmath19 to an operator @xmath20 the number @xmath21 of links at the node determines the number of faces of the polyhedron .",
    "one advantage of this proposal is that it is closer in structure to the spin foam formulation of the dynamics of loop gravity @xcite .",
    "+ in the case of a node with four links , @xmath22 , all three of these proposals for the volume operator coincide and match the operator introduced by barbieri @xcite for the volume of a quantum tetrahedron .",
    "the heart of this paper is a study of the semiclassics of this operator .",
    "remarkably , the space of convex polyhedra with fixed face areas has a natural phase space structure .",
    "this was first shown by kapovich and millson @xcite in a different context ( see also @xcite ) . using this kinematics we study the classical volume dynamics and perform a bohr - sommerfeld quantization of its spectrum .",
    "the semiclassical analysis provides a useful synthesis and simplification of previous results : we find excellent agreement with the studies of the volume operator spectrum @xcite and provide a new derivation of many of its features .",
    "moreover , our analysis provides new geometrical insights on analytic properties of the volume spectrum , such as its degeneracy and the values of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues ; for a detailed list of the new results see the conclusions in section [ sec : volconcs ] .",
    "+ we briefly recall the central ideas of the semiclassical methods used in this paper . the later development of bohr s correspondence principle by sommerfeld and ehrenfest led to an elegant approximate quantization , now called bohr - sommerfeld quantization .",
    "the technique begins by finding the dynamical orbits of the system . in our case , the role of the hamiltonian is played by the volume and we will analyze the volume orbits in phase space . to simplify the analysis . ]",
    "the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition is then expressed in terms of the action integral @xmath23 associated to each of these orbits : @xmath24 where the integral is over the orbit of energy @xmath25 and the quantization level is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "solving for @xmath27 gives a semiclassical approximation for the volume spectrum .",
    "it is interesting to notice that we are deriving the spectrum of the spatial volume in quantum gravity using methods that are older than quantum mechanics itself . in the ` old quantum theory ' ,",
    "the quantization condition was based on a physical assumption about robustness of discrete spectra under slow perturbations .",
    "already several systems were known to have discrete equispaced spectra , for instance the harmonic oscillators in planck s work on the black body spectrum , or in einstein and debye s work on specific heats . if the parameters of these systems are slowly modified , the energy spectrum changes but its discreteness is not destroyed .",
    "lorentz and einstein asked about a classical version of this robustness of spectra : i.e. whether there was a classical quantity that could be preserved under a slow  adiabatic  change of the external parameters of such systems ?",
    "this question led ehrenfest to identify _ adiabatic invariants _ as quantities that , on allowed orbits , are realized in multiples of @xmath28 .",
    "the jacobi action integral @xmath29 can be shown to be an adiabatic invariant for the system , and provides a natural candidate to extend planck s quantization of the energy of the harmonic oscillator to other periodic systems , for example the hydrogen atom .",
    "these methods continue to offer new insights into quantum physics by exposing the classical geometries underlying quantum phenomenon in the semiclassical limit .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : we begin by summarizing the setup for the node hilbert spaces @xmath30 for general valency @xmath21 .",
    "next we describe how this space limits to a classical phase space and describe its poisson structure . in section [ sec : litrev ] we briefly describe what is known about the volume spectrum in loop gravity , focusing on the case @xmath22 of the quantum tetrahedron . in sections",
    "[ sec : classvol ] and [ sec : bstet ] we describe the phase space of a classical tetrahedron , study the volume dynamics , and take up its bohr - sommerfeld quantization .",
    "the spectrum and its degeneracies are reported in sections [ sec : bstet ] and [ subsec : reggesymmetry ] .",
    "elliptic functions play a prominent role in this quantization and section [ sec : limcases ] develops tools for analyzing the largest and smallest volume eigenvalues using the properties of elliptic functions .",
    "section [ sec : volconcs ] summarizes our results .",
    "[ sec : quanttet ]    the graph hilbert space @xmath31 of loop gravity can be built out of gauge - invariant hilbert spaces associated to nodes of the graph .",
    "for the entirety of this paper we focus on a single node @xmath26 and its hilbert space @xmath30 .",
    "let us assume that the node is @xmath21-valent and call the spins labeling its links @xmath32 . to each representation",
    "@xmath33 we associate a vector space @xmath34 that carries the action of the @xmath35 generators @xmath36 .",
    "the standard basis @xmath37 is labelled by eigenvalues of the casimir @xmath38 and the @xmath39-component of @xmath36 , @xmath40 .",
    "the space @xmath30 is defined as the subspace of the tensor product @xmath41 that is invariant under global @xmath35 transformations ( the diagonal action ) @xmath42 we call @xmath30 the space of intertwiners and when emphasizing the parametric dependence on @xmath43 we write @xmath44",
    ". the diagonal action is generated by the operator @xmath45 , @xmath46 states of @xmath30 are called intertwiners and can be expanded in the @xmath47 basis described above , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 the components @xmath50 transform as a tensor under @xmath35 transformations in such a way that the condition @xmath51 is satisfied .",
    "these are precisely the invariant tensors captured graphically by spin networks . in loop gravity a special role is played by the operators @xmath52 as illustrated below .",
    "is the planck length and @xmath53 is the barbero - immirzi parameter .",
    "they should both be understood as coupling constants of the theory . throughout the remainder of the paper we will take @xmath54 . ]",
    "let us now specialize to the case @xmath22 , a node with four links .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath55 is the intertwiner space of four representations of @xmath35 , @xmath56 we introduce a basis into this hilbert space using the recoupling channel @xmath57 and call these basis states @xmath58 .",
    "the basis vectors are defined as @xmath59 where the tensor @xmath60 is defined in terms of wigner @xmath61-symbols by @xmath62 the index @xmath63 ranges from @xmath64 to @xmath65 in integer steps with , @xmath66 the dimension @xmath67 of the hilbert space @xmath55 is finite and given by on an equal footing , @xmath68 @xmath69 the states @xmath58 form an orthonormal basis of eigenstates of the operator @xmath70 . following barbieri @xcite , these states can be understood as describing quantum tetrahedra .",
    "the operator @xmath71 measures the dihedral angle between the faces @xmath72 and @xmath73 of the quantum tetrahedron @xcite .    the operator @xmath74 measures the area of the @xmath72th face of the quantum tetrahedron and states in @xmath55 are area eigenstates with eigenvalues @xmath75 , @xmath76 the volume operator introduced by barbieri is @xmath77 and because of the closure relation @xmath78 this operator coincides with the rovelli - smolin operator for @xmath79 .",
    "it also follows from that the ashtekar - lewandowski operator on @xmath55 is simply given by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a number depending on the grot - rovelli class , see @xcite , of the link tangents at the node that can attain the values @xmath82 .",
    "is defined as @xmath83 ] therefore the ashtekar - lewandowski volume operator coincides numerically with the operators and when the tangents to the links fall into the class corresponding to @xmath84 and the constant @xmath85 is choosen to be @xmath86 as before .",
    "otherwise , it is proportional to it .",
    "the volume operator introduced by barbieri can be understood as a special case of the volume of a quantum polyhedron discussed in @xcite .    in order to compute the spectrum of the volume operator , it is useful to introduce the operator @xmath87 defined as @xmath88 it represents the square of the oriented volume .",
    "the matrix elements of this operator are easily computed and we report them momentarily . the eigenstates @xmath89 of the operator @xmath87 , @xmath90 are also eigenstates of the volume .",
    "the eigenvalues of the volume are simply given by the square - root of the modulus of @xmath91 , @xmath92    the matrix elements of the operator @xmath87 in the basis @xmath58 were originally computed independently by chakrabarti and then by lvy - leblond and lvy - nahas @xcite .",
    "they are @xmath93 here we introduce the shorthand @xmath94 , indeed in the semiclassical limit the operator @xmath95 with casimir @xmath33 is associated to an angular momentum vector @xmath96 with magnitude @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , as explained in @xcite , semiclassical quantization of these angular momenta , which in this case is exact , gives a discrete area spectrum coincident with that of loop gravity .",
    "the function @xmath98 returns the area of a triangle with sides of length @xmath99 and is conveniently expressed in terms of heron s formula @xmath100 computing the spectrum of @xmath87 amounts to computing the eigenvalues of a @xmath101 matrix , where @xmath67 is the dimension of the hilbert space given in ( [ eq : dim ] ) .",
    "this can be done numerically and several of our figures compare the eigenevalues calculated in this manner to the results of the bohr - sommerfeld quantization , see sections [ sec : bstet ] and [ sec : limcases ] .",
    "there are a number of properties of the spectrum of @xmath87 ( and therefore of @xmath102 ) that can be determined analytically .",
    "we list some of them below and refer to lvy - leblond and lvy - nahas @xcite for a detailed analysis :    * the spectrum of @xmath87 is non - degenerate : it contains @xmath67 distinct real eigenvalues .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the matrix elements of @xmath87 in the basis @xmath58 determine a @xmath103 hermitian matrix of the form @xmath104 with real coefficients @xmath105 . for a derivation of this result see appendix a. * the non - vanishing eigenvalues of @xmath87 come in pairs @xmath106 .",
    "a vanishing eigenvalue is present only when the dimension @xmath67 of the intertwiner space is odd .",
    "these two properties are a direct consequence of the structure of the matrix ( [ eq : qmatrix ] ) discussed above .",
    "this matrix is @xmath107 times an antisymmetric matrix and the eigenvalues of antisymmetric matrices have this property .",
    "physically , this is a consequence of the action of parity . * from the above we see that the volume spectrum of a fixed node space @xmath30 , that is , of an intertwiner space with given @xmath108 , is twice degenerate , @xmath109 there is a second , exact degeneracy in the volume spectrum that has not been previously noted .",
    "let @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xmath112 . the volume spectrum of the node spaces @xmath113 and @xmath114 are identical .",
    "this is a manifestation of the regge symmetry , which is briefly discussed in section [ subsec : reggesymmetry ] . * for given spins @xmath108 , brunnemann and thiemann",
    "have estimated the maximum volume eigenvalue using gershgorin s circle theorem @xcite and they find that it scales as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the largest of the four spins @xmath33 .",
    "* they have also estimated the minimum non - vanishing eigenvalue ( volume gap ) and find that it scales as @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "our semiclassical analysis reproduces all of these results and provides several new insights into their structure . for a parallel list of the semiclassical results",
    "see the conclusions .",
    "this completes our review and we turn now to the classical geometry of tetrahedra .",
    "the finite dimensional intertwiner space @xmath30 can be understood as the quantization of a classical phase space @xcite .",
    "we set up this correspondence in three steps : first the relationship between the algebra of vectors and the geometry of convex polyhedra ( minkowski s theorem ) is explained , next we describe how to endow these vectors with poisson and symplectic structures by interpreting them as angular momenta and , finally , we briefly describe how quantization of these objects leads to @xmath30 .",
    "the section concludes with the specialization of these results to the case of tetrahedra and a discussion of the classical volume .",
    "minkowski s theorem , @xcite , states the following : given @xmath21 vectors @xmath118 whose sum is zero @xmath119 there exists , up to rotations and translations , a unique convex polyhedron with @xmath21 faces associated to these vectors .",
    "furthermore , the vectors @xmath120 can be interpreted as the outward pointing normals to the polyhedron and their magnitudes @xmath121 as the face areas .",
    "minkowski s proof is not constructive and so this is strictly an existence and uniqueness theorem .",
    "we call the process of building one of these polyhedra ( given the area vectors ) a minkowski reconstruction . in the case of the tetrahedron",
    "the reconstruction is trivial but for larger @xmath21 this is a difficult problem @xcite .",
    "these convex polyhedra are our semiclassical interpretation of the loop gravity grains of space .",
    "following kapovitch and millson @xcite , we can associate a classical phase space to these polyhedra .",
    "we interpret the partial sums @xmath122 as generators of rotations about the @xmath123 axis .",
    "this follows naturally from interpreting each of the @xmath96 vectors as a classical angular momentum .",
    "there is a well - known poisson structure on a single angular momentum ( the lie - poisson bracket , see @xcite ) and this extends to the bracket @xmath124 on @xmath21 distinct angular momenta , here @xmath125 and @xmath126 are arbitrary functions of the @xmath96 . with this poisson bracket the @xmath127 do , in fact ,",
    "generate rotations about the axis @xmath128 . this geometrical interpretation suggests a natural conjugate coordinate , namely the angle of the rotation .",
    "let @xmath129 be the angle between the vectors @xmath130 it is an easy check to show that @xmath131 the pairs @xmath132 are canonical coordinates for a classical phase space of dimension @xmath133 ; this dimensionality is further explained below .",
    "we call this the space of shapes and denote it by @xmath134 or more briefly @xmath135",
    ".    the explicit inclusion of the @xmath136 in @xmath137 highlights a parametric dependence of the space of shapes on the magnitudes @xmath136 .",
    "this parametric dependence is more natural when viewed from another perspective on @xmath135 , i.e. viewing it as a symplectic reduction of the product of @xmath21 two spheres , @xmath138 . upon fixing the magnitude @xmath136",
    ", the angular momentum vector @xmath120 is restricted to a sphere of radius @xmath136 .",
    "this sphere is a symplectic leaf of the poisson manifold described above and the collection of all the spheres @xmath138 can be endowed with the product symplectic structure .",
    "if we now symplectically reduce @xmath138 by the zero level set of the momentum map @xmath139 we once again obtain @xmath135 .",
    "this also explains the dimension of the reduced space ; because zero is a fixed point of the group action we lose twice as many dimensions as there are components of the momentum map , @xmath140 .",
    "finally , that the quantization of @xmath135 is the hilbert space @xmath30 of an @xmath21-valent node @xmath26 can be seen as follows : lift the @xmath21 angular momentum vectors @xmath120 via the schwinger map to a phase space of @xmath141 harmonic oscillators , @xmath142 .",
    "these oscillators can be quantized in the standard fashion and once again the schwinger map can be used , on the quantum side , to reduce to @xmath21 quantum angular momenta .",
    "the constraint @xmath143 becomes @xmath144 which is precisely the gauge invariance condition .",
    "we turn now to the classical analog of formula , the volume of a tetrahedron as a function on the shape phase space @xmath145 . this will be the starting point of our bohr - sommerfeld analysis in the next section .",
    "as discussed above the minkowski theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a tetrahedron associated to any four vectors @xmath120 , @xmath146 that satisfy @xmath147 . without loss of generality",
    "we will take @xmath148 . in terms of these magnitudes ,",
    "a condition for the existence of a tetrahedron is that @xmath149 , equality yielding a flat ( zero volume ) tetrahedron .",
    "this is clearly necessary , as there would be no way to satisfy closure if @xmath150 held .",
    "it is not difficult to argue that this is also sufficient for there to exist at least one tetrahedron with these face areas ( in fact , there are infinitely many ) .",
    "the space of tetrahedra with four fixed face areas @xmath151 is , as we will now argue , a sphere .",
    "following the general construction outlined above , the canonical coordinates on @xmath152 are @xmath153 and @xmath154 , the angle between @xmath155 and @xmath156 . for the remainder of the paper",
    "we adopt the simplified notation @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "recalling that the @xmath160 vectors are to be thought of as generators of @xmath35 actions we observe that @xmath161 generates rotations of @xmath162 and @xmath163 about the @xmath164-axis .",
    "this action rotates @xmath165 about the , perpendicular , @xmath164-axis while leaving @xmath166 fixed and thus increments the angle @xmath167 .",
    "this is the geometrical content of the poisson bracket relation @xmath168 . because @xmath169 is fixed by this rotation the closure condition , @xmath170 is also unaffected by such a rotation .",
    "consequently , we have a whole circle of distinct tetrahedra for each value of @xmath161 with @xmath171 , where @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "the collection of these circles over the interval of allowed @xmath161 values is the slicing of a sphere into lines of latitude over the range of its @xmath39 diameter .",
    "this is made precise by the behavior at the ends of the range of @xmath161 ; either the vectors @xmath162 and @xmath163 or the vectors @xmath174 and @xmath175 become colinear , and consequently the four @xmath161-vectors are coplanar .",
    "such configurations are all equivalent up to overall rotations in @xmath176 and hence under the kapovich - millson reduction they correspond to a single point in the reduced space . as usual , the @xmath167 coordinate becomes ill defined at these poles , here this is because either @xmath165 or @xmath166 vanishes .    .",
    "the darkened contours are quantized level sets of the classical volume squared , @xmath177 .",
    "one quantized level set is hidden from view .",
    "the inset depicts a tetrahedron corresponding to the dot on the @xmath178 level set .",
    "the point corresponding to the tetrahedron with the largest possible volume , given the face area constraints , is also marked with a dot .",
    "the shape space coordinates are indicated at the top of the sphere . , height=249 ]    the shape space sphere is depicted in figure [ redvol ] .",
    "the embedding space is @xmath176 and can be thought of as a copy of the @xmath35 lie algebra associated to @xmath169 , we will call this angular momentum space @xmath179 . coordinates on @xmath179 and the shape space sphere are defined as follows : place the origin of @xmath179 at the center of the range of @xmath161 and choose cartesian coordinates @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 with @xmath183 .",
    "the radius of the shape space sphere is @xmath184 and the relation @xmath185 together with the angle @xmath167 from above define a spherical coordinate system on the sphere .",
    "the phase space geometry discussed here is a close analog to that of the symmetry reduced phase space of the @xmath186-symbol , see @xcite for extensive discussion of the @xmath186-symbol case .",
    "the classical analog of the volume , , is @xmath187 and just as with the quantum theory it will be more straightforward to work with the squared classical volume , @xmath188 a quick vector algebra calculation will convince you that these are indeed the volume and squared volume of a classical tetrahedron . because @xmath177 is a rotational invariant quantity it projects onto the shape phase space and can be thought of as a function of the @xmath161 and @xmath167 coordinates , @xmath189 . and @xmath182 differ by a constant shift we will freely switch between them . ]",
    "this expression is easily derived by computing @xmath190 ; from the definitions of @xmath165 and @xmath166 one finds @xmath191 note that the magnitude @xmath192 is equal to twice the area @xmath193 of a triangle with side lengths @xmath194 and @xmath161 and , using the closure relation , similarly @xmath195 is twice the area @xmath196 of a triangle with side lengths @xmath197 and @xmath161 . the definition of @xmath167 as the angle between @xmath165 and @xmath166 allows us to conclude that the volume squared is @xmath198 calculating the areas @xmath193 and @xmath196 using heron s formula , @xmath199[a^{2}-(a_1-a_2)^{2}]},\\\\ \\label{triangle2 } \\bar{\\delta }        & = \\frac{1}{4 } \\sqrt{[(a_3+a_4)^{2}-a^2][a^{2}-(a_3-a_4)^{2}]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] shows that for fixed @xmath200 , @xmath177 is indeed only a function of the coordinates @xmath161 and @xmath167 .",

    "the right hand side can be evaluated by differentiating with respect to @xmath167 , @xmath211 equation can be used again to eliminate the cosine function , @xmath212 the argument of the square root plays an important role in what follows and so we introduce a shorthand for it , @xmath213 this is a quartic polynomial in @xmath209 and while the general expressions for its roots are complicated they simplify when @xmath214 , and so we further define , @xmath215 equations and yield a factored expression for @xmath216 : @xmath217[a^{2}-(a_3-a_4)^{2}][(a_1+a_2)^{2}-a^2][(a_3+a_4)^{2}-a^2].\\ ] ]    taking the shorthand @xmath218 we can separate variables in and integrate to find , @xmath219 we assume that the four distinct real roots @xmath220 of the quartic @xmath221 are ordered as @xmath222 .",

    "we now apply these ideas to the case of the volume spectrum .",
    "the volume dynamics generates closed orbits in phase space .",
    "in fact , for every allowed non - zero value of the volume there are two closed orbits satisfying @xmath289 .",
    "the two orbits are sent one into the other by a parity transformation of the tetrahedron and while the oriented volume square @xmath290 is odd under parity , the volume eigenvalue @xmath291 is invariant .",

    "the orbit with vanishing volume is invariant under parity and so , @xmath292 , when it is an allowed quantum level , is non - degenerate .",

    "figure [ fig : actionplot ] provides an example of this case . + there is a second more subtle degeneracy : the tabulation of appendix [ app : tables ] exposes a degeneracy in the volume spectra of distinct intertwiner spaces .",
    "the clearest example of this in our tables , is for the spins @xmath295 and @xmath296 ; the volume spectra of these two intertwiner spaces agree exactly .",

    "evidently , scissors congruence preserves volumes .    in the present context",
    "this symmetry completely explains the degeneracy of the volume spectra ; besides the minkowski tetrahedron having the vectors @xmath96 as face normals , we prove this using an auxiliary tetrahedron having edge vectors @xmath96 .",
    "this auxiliary tetrahedron has volume @xmath301 .",
    "now , performing a regge transformation we obtain a second auxiliary tetrahedron that is scissor congruent to the first one .",

    "moreover , for every auxiliary tetrahedron in the phase space @xmath152 we have a scissor congruent tetrahedron in the regge transformed phase space @xmath304 . as a result",
    "the action integrals also coincide , @xmath305 , and the degeneracy of the volume spectrum is explained .",
    "the regge degeneracy of the spectrum leads to a conjecture : we have shown above that two minkowski tetrahedra related by a regge symmetry have the same volume .",
    "are they also scissor congruent ?",
    "we conjecture that they are .",
    "the proof of this conjecture hinges on showing that these two tetrahedra have the same dehn or hadwiger invariants , again see @xcite .",
    "we leave the investigation of this conjecture open for future work .",
    "before proceeding to a bohr - sommerfeld analysis of the limiting values of the volume spectrum , we investigate the classical extrema of @xmath306 . at the classical level ,",
    "the minimum of @xmath306 is always zero : open the angle @xmath167 until the plane spanned by @xmath162 and @xmath307 coincides with the plane spanned by @xmath174 and @xmath308 , then @xmath214 .",
    "this , however , does not lead to the conclusion that the minimum of @xmath309 is always zero .",
    "this is because the minkowki theorem does not hold for planar configurations of the @xmath120 , instead it is generically singular for these configurations .",
    "certainly @xmath214 implies that @xmath310 , however , the issue is the correspondence between a planar set of @xmath120 and such a flat tetrahedron .",
    "geometrically this is clear , a flat tetrahedron has _",
    "faces _ that lie in a plane and the normals to these faces are all collinear .",
    "thus it is only the subset of planar configurations of vectors @xmath120 that are actually collinear that can have a minkowki type correspondence with a flat tetrahedron .",
    "we can say more : the collinear vectors must satisfy closure and so , for some choice of signs we must have @xmath311 . taking into account the ordering convention @xmath312",
    "we can bring the number of cases down to just two @xmath313 the latter condition leads to a trivial shape space consisting of a single point because @xmath314 .",
    "we will call these two conditions the  flatness \" conditions .",
    "they are also significant for the bohr - sommerfeld quantization .",
    "note that , even for collinear configurations of the @xmath120 the minkowski theorem still does nt hold .",
    "the trouble is uniqueness .",
    "an infinite number of flat configurations all share the same area vectors .",
    "in fact , the differential structure of the shape space breaks down when the flatness conditions are satisfied ( for an analogous observation see @xcite ) .",
    "the qualitative picture is that when flat configurations are present the phase space sphere develops a cusp and looks more like an inverted rain drop .",
    "notice that everything that has been said up to this point is in regards to a tetrahedron that is exactly flat .",
    "this is significant because it highlights the singular nature of the minkowski construction for planar configurations of the @xmath96 .",
    "one can construct a tetrahedron with arbitrarily small volume from a set of vectors that is arbitrarily close to planar , there is only trouble when exactly flat tetrahedra are desired .",
    "the precise treatment of flat configurations warrants further investigation .    for the purposes of the present work",
    "we summarize the preceding observations : unless the flatness conditions are satisfied , @xmath214 should not lead to the conclusion that there is a constructible tetrahedron with @xmath310 ; if a flatness condition is satisfied then only the corresponding pole of the shape space sphere corresponds to flat configurations with @xmath310 and it generally corresponds to a whole class of such tetrahedra .",
    "one example would look like a square made out of two right triangles of side length @xmath315 and with , say , upward pointing normals and two downward normals .",
    "however , this can also be achieved with any rhombus that has side length @xmath316 and acute angle @xmath317 satisfying @xmath318 . thus there is a one parameter family of tetrahedra with @xmath319 . ] ; thus the great circle on which @xmath214 ( @xmath320 ) will be regarded as mathematically useful but largely physically meaningless .    turning to the maxima of @xmath177 ,",
    "take three faces to have fixed areas , say @xmath194 and @xmath321 but the full vectors @xmath322 not to be given .",
    "writing the triple product of @xmath177 as the determinant of a matrix @xmath323 whose columns are the vectors @xmath324 and @xmath174 and squaring yields , @xmath325 where @xmath326 denotes the transpose of @xmath327 . taking the unknown dot products @xmath328 as variables and extremizing",
    "one finds the minima already discussed , where @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath174 are collinear , and a single global maximum where @xmath329 .",
    "this maximum must satisfy closure and so , @xmath330 then the maximum volume of a tetrahedron with three fixed face areas is the one with three right dihedral angles and the fourth face area given by the equation above .",
    "if the same technique is used to maximize the volume over the space where all four face areas are given then the closure condition must be implemented as a constraint . for fixed @xmath331 , @xmath332 and @xmath321",
    "it is clear that the constrained maximum will not be larger than the one just found and will be equal to it when the fixed value of @xmath333 is that of . rather than implementing the constraint with a lagrange multiplier it is easier to extremize equation , which treats the @xmath334 on an equal footing .",
    "once again we use the shorthand @xmath335 for the polynomial part of the area product @xmath336 , @xmath337[a^{2}-(a_3-a_4)^{2}][(a_1+a_2)^{2}-a^2][(a_3+a_4)^{2}-a^2],\\ ] ] that is , @xmath338 .",
    "the expression for the squared volume simplifies to @xmath339 .",
    "this expression is maximized when @xmath340 and when @xmath341 or , @xmath342 this condition is another quartic equation , the roots of which are not worth explicitly displaying in general , however choosing the root which maximizes @xmath177 , say @xmath343 , then we have @xmath344 , which justifies our claim at .",
    "this expression will be useful below for finding the largest eigenvalues of @xmath102 .",
    "these two cases exhaust the most natural constraints on the face areas .",
    "if you fix only two of the face areas the volume can grow without bound .",
    "so far we have considered only constraints on the face areas .",
    "another natural constraint is to require that the total surface area of the tetrahedron be constant and look for the largest volume within this class .",
    "as one might expect , similar arguments to those presented above lead to the conclusion that the largest volume tetrahedron under this constraint is the one with all face areas equal .",
    "this concludes our general treatment of the extrema of @xmath177 .",
    "the limiting behavior of the volume spectrum for large and small eigenvalues can now be explored with the assistance of the analytical formula .",
    "let us first consider large eigenvalues : the volume function attains a maximum on the sphere and so our strategy will be to expand the action function around this maximum .",
    "we have , @xmath345 from the theory of action - angle variables , the derivative of the action with respect to the hamiltonian ( in this case the volume ) is the period @xmath346 of the system .",
    "for the largest eigenvalue , we are in the same situation as if we were finding a ground state , that is , instead of capturing @xmath347 worth of area on the sphere this state only captures an area @xmath348 and so , @xmath349 then the largest eigenvalue is given by , @xmath350 at equation we found that the maximum classical volume is attained when , @xmath351 or more explicitly when , @xmath352 the roots of this quartic for generic @xmath136 are complicated functions of the @xmath136 , however in the case @xmath353 this equation is easily solved and one finds , @xmath354 .",
    "the maximum classical volume in this case is @xmath355 and the period is @xmath356 .",
    "the maximum eigenvalue is given by putting these values into , @xmath357 this reproduces the @xmath358 scaling that has been found in previous works and refines it to the next order .",
    "this scaling is plotted as the uppermost line in figure [ eqjplot ] .",
    "further corrections could be developed by retaining more terms in . as discussed in section [ subsec : classicalcases ] , this is the appropriate scaling to consider under the constraint of fixed total surface area .",
    "consequently , this scaling may be interesting to investigate in more detail within the @xmath359 framework @xcite .",
    "occasionally the equal area tetrahedron has been supposed to be the one whose volume grows most rapidly as the areas are increased .",
    "however , we have seen above that this is not always the case .",
    "the tetrahedron with maximum volume depends on the space under consideration . for the space with three face areas fixed , corner tetrahedra with , for example , @xmath360 and @xmath361 are maximizing . indeed , solving for these corner tetrahedra we find a larger scaling coefficient , @xmath362 in figure [ noneqjplot ] the bohr - sommerfeld spectrum is compared to the numerically calculated exact spectrum and the scaling derived here for the corner tetrahedra .     and and",

    "this would be the end of the story except for the fact that there are a number of shape spaces for which the period at zero volume can become infinitely long and the taylor expansion above is invalidated . for this reason , we have to treat different shape spaces individually .",
    "we will begin by treating the case where the period is finite , as it is simpler .",
    "one subtlety of the small volume cases is immediate : the smallest eigenvalue depends on the dimension of the intertwiner space , @xmath367 .",

    "we are interested in the first non - zero eigenvalue and thus when @xmath67 is odd the spacing @xmath368 is the spacing between two quantized orbits , @xmath2 , or in our units @xmath369 .",
    "for the finite period case that we are considering the taylor expansion is valid and we have , @xmath370 . on the other hand",
    "if the phase space is even dimensional , neighboring quantized orbits evenly straddle the zero volume contour and we have @xmath371 , so that @xmath372 .",

    "however , notice that this special choice of the @xmath389 leads to @xmath390 and invalidates the expansion of the elliptic integral @xmath230 , in particular @xmath391 logarithmically diverges ( hence also the period ) and a different approach to estimating the eigenvalues is necessary .",
