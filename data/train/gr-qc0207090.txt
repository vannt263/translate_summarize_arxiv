    "the purpose of this article is to prove , under appropriate assumptions , the following statement : the interaction energy , at large separation distance @xmath0 , between two black holes of masses @xmath1 , @xmath2 and spins @xmath3 , @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a unit vector which points inward along the line connecting the black holes . before giving a precise definition of the parameters involved in eq .",
    "( [ eq:32 ] ) , i want to discuss its physical meaning .",
    "the first term in eq . ( [ eq:32 ] ) has the newtonian form . for two point particles of masses @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 separated by an euclidean distance @xmath0 , the newtonian interaction energy between them is given by @xmath7 .",
    "the fact that this term appears also for a two black holes system in general relativity can be expected from the weak field limit of einstein s equations . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:32 ] ) , which involves the spins , has analogous form to the dipole - dipole electromagnetic interaction ; there exists an analogy between magnetic dipole in electromagnetism and spin in general relativity ( see @xcite ) . in the electromagnetic case",
    ", @xmath0 is the euclidean distance between two charge distributions and @xmath3 , @xmath4 the corresponding dipole moments of them .",
    "however , the gravitational black hole spin - spin interaction has the opposite sign to the electromagnetic one .",
    "the first evidence of this fact was given by hawking @xcite .",
    "i want to reproduce hawking s argument here because it points out the connection between eq .",
    "( [ eq:32 ] ) and the cosmic censorship conjecture ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) . in the argument , we assume the following two consequences of weak cosmic censorship and the theory of black holes ( cf .",
    "@xcite @xcite , see also @xcite ) :    * every apparent horizon must be entirely contained within the black hole event horizon . *",
    "if matter satisfies the null energy condition ( i.e. if @xmath8 for all null @xmath9 ) , then the area of the event horizon of a black hole can not decrease in time .",
    "we also assume :    * all black holes eventually settle down to a final kerr black hole .",
    "consider a system of two black holes such that , at a given time , the separation distance between them is large .",
    "then , there must exist a cauchy surface in the asymptotically flat region of the space time such that the intersection of the hypersurface with the event horizon has two disconnected component of areas @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "since the black holes are far apart , these areas can be approximated by the kerr formula @xmath12 at late times , after the collision , the system will settle down to a kerr black hole .",
    "hence , there must exist another cauchy hypersurface such that its intersection with the event horizon will have area @xmath13 where @xmath14 is mass of the final black hole and @xmath15 is its final angular momentum . by ( ii )",
    "we have @xmath16 since gravitational waves have positive mass , we also have @xmath17 in general , gravitational waves will carry angular momentum .",
    "but in _ axially symmetric _ space - times the total angular momentum is a conserved quantity , since it can be defined by a komar integral ( cf . @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "then , in this case we have @xmath18 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) , ( [ eq:27 ] ) , ( [ eq:28 ] ) and ( [ eq:30 ] ) it is possible to obtain an upper bound , which depends on @xmath3 and @xmath4 , to the total amount of radiation emitted by the system @xmath19 .",
    "it can be seen that if @xmath3 and @xmath4 have the same sign , this upper bound is smaller than if they have opposite sign .",
    "this suggests that there may be a spin - spin force between the black holes that is attractive if the angular momentum have opposite directions and repulsive if they have the same direction .",
    "presumably , in the second case the system expends energy in doing work against the spin repulsive force , and for this reason this energy is not available to be radiated via gravitational radiation .",
    "hawking s argument only suggests that the spin interaction energy between black holes has in fact this sign dependence with respect to the spins .",
    "it is not a proof , first because there is no proof for the weak cosmic censorship conjecture ( i)-(ii ) and for the assumption ( iii ) .",
    "second , because even if we assume ( i)(iii ) the argument only shows that an upper bound of the total amount of radiated energy has this sign dependence in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , but the real amount of gravitational radiation can , in principle , have other dependence .",
    "in fact , the total amount of gravitational radiation produced by such systems , as numerical studies show , is much smaller than this bound .",
    "this upper bound is @xmath20 of the total mass when the spins are antiparallel , the black holes are extreme ( @xmath21 ) , and have equal masses ; when the spins are zero or when the black holes are extreme with parallel spins , the upper bound is @xmath22 of the total mass . on the other hand , in the numerical calculations",
    "the maximum amount of radiation emitted by this type of system is about @xmath23 of the total mass , see @xcite @xcite for a recent calculation and also @xcite for an up to date review on the subject .",
    "however , the numerical studies show that the system indeed radiates less when the spins are parallel than when they are antiparallel .",
    "moreover , wald @xcite proves that the interaction energy between a test particle with spin @xmath4 and a stationary background of spin @xmath3 has precisely this sign dependence .",
    "wald shows that the spin - spin interaction energy has the form @xmath24 where @xmath0 and @xmath6 are defined as follows . the stationary field",
    "is expanded at large distance with respect to cartesian asymptotic coordinates @xmath25 , here @xmath0 is the euclidean radius with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "( [ eq:31 ] ) has been also proved by death using post - newtonian expansions @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that eq .",
    "( [ eq:31 ] ) gives an indirect evidence in support of ( i)-(iii ) .    in this article",
    "i want to prove eq .",
    "( [ eq:31 ] ) without using either the particle or post - newtonian approximation .",
    "the proof is based on an interaction energy defined on the two black hole initial data .",
    "this interaction energy is genuinely non linear ; it does not involve any approximation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ main ] the main results are given . in section [ by ] theorem [ t1 ] is proved ; in section [ twokerr ] we prove corollary [ c1 ] .",
    "finally , in section [ dis ] an alternative definition of the interaction energy is discussed .",
    "the strategy i will follow was given by brill and lindquist @xcite . it is based on the analysis of _ initial data set _ with many _",
    "asymptotic ends_. an _ initial data set _ for the einstein vacuum equations is given by a triple @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a connected 3-dimensional manifold , @xmath29 a ( positive definite ) riemannian metric , and @xmath30 a symmetric tensor field on @xmath28 .",
    "they satisfy the vacuum constraint equations @xmath31 @xmath32 on @xmath28 , where @xmath33 is the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the trace of the corresponding ricci tensor , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 denote abstract indices .",
    "tensor indices of quantities with tilde will be moved with the metric @xmath34 and its inverse @xmath38 .",
    "the data will be called _ asymptotically flat _ with @xmath39 _ asymptotic ends _ , if for some compact set @xmath40 we have that @xmath41 , where @xmath42 are open sets such that each @xmath42 can be mapped by a coordinate system @xmath43 diffeomorphically onto the complement of a closed ball in @xmath44 such that we have in these coordinates @xmath45 @xmath46 as @xmath47 in each set @xmath42 ; where @xmath48 , which take values @xmath49 , denote coordinates indices with respect to the given coordinate system @xmath43 , and @xmath50 denotes the flat metric .",
    "we will call the coordinate system @xmath25 an _ asymptotic coordinate system _ at the end @xmath51 .",
    "each asymptotic region @xmath42 has a different asymptotic coordinate system .",
    "the constant @xmath52 denotes the adm mass@xcite of the data at the end @xmath51 .",
    "these conditions guarantee that the mass , the linear momentum , and the angular momentum of the initial data set are well defined at every end .    for @xmath53",
    ", this class of data contains , in general , apparent horizons .",
    "the existence of apparent horizons leads us to interpret these data as representing initial data for black - holes .",
    "their evolution will presumably contain an event horizon , according to the standard theory of black holes @xcite .",
    "the validity of this picture depends , of course , on the cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "the only statement about the evolution of the data that we can make is the geodesic incompleteness of the space time . in general , in order to prove the geodesic incompleteness of a space time , one needs to know that the data contain a trapped surface in order to apply the singularities theorems @xcite .",
    "however , in this particular case , since the topology of the data is not trivial , the geodesic incompleteness of the space time follows directly from a theorem proved by gannon @xcite .    for simplicity we will fix @xmath54 , see fig . [ fig:1 ] .",

    ", we have the corresponding mass @xmath52 and total angular momentum @xmath55.,width=226 ]    in this case the data can be interpreted as initial data with two black holes . this interpretation is suggested by the following fact : when an appropriate distance parameter is large compared with the masses @xmath52 , then it can be seen numerically that only two disconnected apparent horizons appear . for time symmetric data , these numeric calculations have been done in @xcite ; the non - time symmetric case has been studied by cook ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is not clear that the number of apparent horizons is the number of black holes contained in the data , since even when there are two disconnected apparent horizons , the intersection of the event horizon with the initial data can be connected .",
    "however , at large separation distance , this seems to be a reasonable assumption , which is confirmed by the numerical evolutions @xcite .",
    "brill and lindquist define the following interaction energy at the end @xmath51 @xmath56 the energy @xmath57 is a geometric quantity ; its definition does not involves any approximation .",
    "the question now is how to calculate @xmath58 in terms of physically relevant parameters .",
    "the first problem is how to define an appropriate separation distance between the black holes . when there are two apparent horizons , there is a well defined separation distance @xmath59 defined as the minimum geodesic distance between any two points in the two different horizons , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .    , @xmath11 , and radii @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the points @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent the two other infinities @xmath64 and @xmath65 . the geodesic distance @xmath59 is computed with the physical metric @xmath34 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is computed with the conformal metric .",
    "the geodesic distance between @xmath62 and @xmath63 with respect to the physical metric is infinite.,width=226 ]    however , the distance @xmath59 is hard to compute .",
    "the location of the apparent horizons can be calculated only numerically .",
    "since we are only interested in the energy at large separations , instead of @xmath59 we will use another parameter @xmath0 , and we will argue that @xmath66 in this limit .",
    "the definition of the parameter @xmath0 is related to the way in which one can construct solutions of the constraint equations with many asymptotic ends .",
    "the conformal method ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) is a general method for constructing solutions of the constraint equations .",
    "we assume that @xmath67 is a positive definite metric with covariant derivative @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is a trace - free ( with respect to @xmath67 ) , symmetric tensor , satisfying @xmath70 let @xmath71 be a solution of @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath67 .",
    "then the physical fields @xmath75 defined by @xmath76 and @xmath77 will satisfy the vacuum constraint equations on @xmath28 .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath69 is trace - free ; hence @xmath78 will be also trace - free with respect to @xmath79 .",
    "that is , the initial data set will be _",

    "it is possible to discuss the same construction in a more geometrical way , such that all ends are treated equally ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the coordinate system @xmath25 and the corresponding flat metric in the expansion eq .",

    "we need initial data with non trivial angular momentum , that is we have to allow for non trivial extrinsic curvature in the data . at each end",
    "we have the angular momentum @xmath98 given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a two sphere defined in the asymptotic region @xmath101 and @xmath102 is its outward unit normal vector . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:34 ] ) we can use either @xmath69 or @xmath78 because the conformal factor satisfies ( [ eq:37 ] ) .",
    "in general the angular momentum at each end is _ not _ determined by the intrinsic angular momentum of each black hole .",
    "it includes also the angular momentum of the gravitational field surrounding the black holes .",
    "then , in general , there is no relations between @xmath103 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , these three quantities can be freely prescribed .",
    "but in the presence of symmetries these quantities can not be given freely any more .",

    "hence , for each conformal symmetry @xmath104 we have the associated integral @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a close 2-surface and @xmath102 its outward unit normal vector .",
