    "the ridge structure in two - particle correlation has been studied in nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) for several years @xcite and is now also seen in @xmath5 collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "the nature of that structure is that it is narrow in @xmath6 ( azimuthal angle @xmath7 relative to that of the trigger ) but broad in @xmath0 ( pseudorapidity @xmath1 relative to the trigger ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the range in @xmath0 is found to be as large as 4 .",
    "so far there is no consensus on the origin of the ridge formation @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that the wide @xmath0 distribution implies long - range correlation @xcite .",
    "that is a view based partially on the conventional estimate that the correlation length is about 2 @xcite .",
    "we make here a comparison between the @xmath1 ranges of single - particle distribution and two - particle correlation , using only the experimental data from phobos @xcite .",
    "it is found that the large-@xmath0 ridge  is related simply to a shift of the inclusive  and an integral over the trigger @xmath1 . that is a phenomenological observation without any theoretical input",
    ". any successful model of ridge formation should be able to explain that relationship .",
    "there are subtleties about the single - particle  for all charges , @xmath8 , that to our knowledge has not been satisfactorily explained in all its details . since it sums over all charges , hadrons of different types are included , making @xmath8 to be quite different from @xmath9 , which can be fitted by a gaussian distribution in @xmath10 with width @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "that difference can not be readily accounted for in any simple hadronization scheme .",
    "fortunately , detailed examination of @xmath8 is not required before we find its relationship to the ridge  @xmath12 , since both are for unidentified charged hadrons , and the empirical verification is based on the data from the same experimental group ( phobos ) .    as a consequence of the phenomenological relationship",
    ", we consider the possibility that there is no intrinsic long - range longitudinal correlation apart from what gives rise to the single - particle distribution . we have found that to generate @xmath13 it is only necessary to have transverse correlation at different points in @xmath1 , provided that at early time the small-@xmath14 partons do not expand in hubble - like manner .",
    "if spatial uncertainty of wee partons are allowed at early time , the identification of spatial and momentum rapidities may not be valid near the tip of the forward light cone .",
    "therein lies the origin of transverse correlation due to the possibility of near crossing of soft- and hard - parton trajectories .",
    "the energy lost by a hard parton enhances the thermal energies of the medium partons in the vicinity of the hard parton s trajectory .",
    "the transverse broadening of any small-@xmath14 parton that passes through the cone of that enhancement leads to measurable effect of the ridge .",
    "the parton model that we use does not rely on flux tubes or hydrodynamics .",
    "recently , the existence of ridge has been called into question by investigations on the effect of fluctuations of the initial configurations in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . using hydrodynamical model and transport theory to relate the eccentricities of the spatial initial state in the transverse plane to the azimuthal momentum anisotropy in the final state , it has been shown that the harmonic coefficients @xmath15 observed in the data can be understood in terms of such transverse fluctuations @xcite .",
    "that is , however , only one of the possible interpretations of @xmath15 .",
    "the effect of minijets on the initial configuration can yield similar consequences . in a companion article @xcite",
    "it is shown that the data on @xmath15 can also be well reproduced by taking the minijets into account in the recombination model without the details of hydrodynamics . here",
    ", we raise the issue about the effect of longitudinal fluctuations that seem to be as important as transverse fluctuations , but have hardly been investigated .",
    "after the phenomenological relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath8 is established in sec .  2 , we give our interpretation of the phenomenon in sec .",
    "it is not our objective to give a review of all other models that can reproduce the data on the ridge structure and assess their likelihood to explain the empirical observation made in sec .  2 .",
    "we offer only to show the possibility that the ridge can have the observed properties in the absence of long - range longitudinal correlation .",
    "section 3 includes many subsections in which both longitudinal and transverse aspects of the correlation are examined in the parton model .",
    "our conclusion is given in sec .",
    "our focus is on the phobos data on two - particle correlation measured with a trigger particle having transverse momentum @xmath16 gev / c in au + au collisions at @xmath17 gev @xcite .",

    "the per - trigger ridge yield integrated over @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath20 , includes all charged hadrons with @xmath21 mev / c at @xmath22 and @xmath23 mev / c at @xmath24 , where the superscript @xmath25 stands for associated particle in the ridge .",
    "for simplicity we use the notation @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 . since all ridge particles are included in the range @xmath19 , the @xmath6 dependence of the ridge structure",

    ", it is important to use single - particle @xmath1 distribution , @xmath8 , that has the same kinematical constraints as the ridge distribution .",
    "that is , it involves an integration over @xmath32 and a sum over all charged hadrons @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and the lower limit of the @xmath32 integration is @xmath35 mev / c in keeping with the acceptance window of @xmath36 @xcite .",

    "the dashed line shows the central gaussian , while the dash - dotted line shows the two side gaussians .",
    "the purpose of the fit is mainly to give an analytic representation of @xmath8 to be used for comparison with the ridge distribution .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to point out that the width @xmath41 of the central gaussian in @xmath1 is larger than the width of the pion @xmath10-distribution , @xmath11 , mentioned in sec .  1 .",
    "the two side - gaussians are undoubtedly related to the production of protons , since brahms data show significant @xmath42 ratio above @xmath43 and @xmath44 gev / c @xcite . the value of @xmath45 in eq .",

    "2 with @xmath48 being adjusted to fit the height of the ridge distribution ; its value is @xmath54 .",
    "the peak in the data around @xmath55 is , of course , due to the jet component associated with the trigger jet and is not relevant to our comparison here .",
    "that component has been studied in the recombination model as a consequence of thermal - shower recombination that can give a good description of the peak both in @xmath0 and @xmath6 @xcite . for the ridge considered here ,",
    "it is evident that the large @xmath0 distribution in fig .  2",
    "is well reproduced by eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "since our concern is to elucidate the implications of the range of @xmath0 , we leave the fluctuation from the flat distribution in the interval @xmath56 as an experimental problem . in qualitative terms",
    "the width of the ridge distribution is due partly to the width of @xmath8 and partly to the smearing of @xmath49 , which adds another 1.5 to the width .",
    "no intrinsic dynamics of long - range longitudinal correlation has been put in .",
    "note that the center of the plateau in @xmath0 is at @xmath57 , which is the average of the shift due to @xmath49 being integrated from 0 to 1.5 .",
    "it suggests that if @xmath49 were fixed at @xmath58 when abundant data become available , then the width of @xmath13 would be only as wide as that of the single - particle @xmath8 .",
    "no theoretical prejudice has influenced these observations .",
    "we now consider an interpretation of what eq .",

    "then we describe a model for ridge formation first for azimuthal dependence at mid - rapidity , then for larger pseudo - rapidity pertinent to the data .",
    "the considerations from various perspectives lead to the notion of transverse correlation that will become the core element of our model to explain the ridge phenomenon .      since the observed ridge  integrates over trigger @xmath1 ,",

    "[ 6 ] comparing eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) to ( [ 4 ] ) we see that the ridge  @xmath65 is to be related to the phenomenological quantity @xmath66 .",
    "thus the crux of the relationship between the ridge and inclusive s involves the interpretation of @xmath67 . to that end",
    "let us first write @xmath68 in the form _",
    "1^h_2(_2,p_2)=dn^h_2d_2p_2dp_2=h^h_2(_2,p_2 ) v(p_2 ) , v(p_2)=e^-p_2/t , [ 7 ] where @xmath69 is the transverse component that contains the explicit exponential behavior of @xmath60 .",
    "although @xmath70 has some mild @xmath60 dependence due mainly to mass effects of @xmath59 , the average transverse momentum @xmath71 is determined primarily by the inverse slope @xmath72 and is not dependent on @xmath50 .",
    "this is an approximate statement that is based on the brahms data @xcite , which show that @xmath73 is essentially independent of rapidity .",
    "since @xmath48 serves as the phenomenological bridge between @xmath74 and @xmath68 , the key question to address is : which of the two components , the longitudinal @xmath70 or the transverse @xmath69 , does the two - particle correlation generated by a trigger at @xmath49 exert its most important influence in relating @xmath74 to @xmath68 ?",
    "if there is longitudinal correlation from early times as in @xcite , then its effect must be to convert @xmath70 to @xmath65 . in that case",
    "@xmath69 is relegated to the secondary role due to radial flow ( which is , nevertheless , essential in explaining the @xmath6 restriction as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is no intrinsic long - range longitudinal correlation , then @xmath70 is unaffected , and the ridge can only arise from the change in the transverse component , @xmath69 , due to a hard scattering that leads to the trigger . without phenomenology",
    "one would think that the first option is more reasonable , when @xmath75 is regarded as large , and especially when there is an inclination based on theoretical ideas that there is long - range correlation . with the ridge phenomenology described by eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) pointing to direct relevance of @xmath70 , the question becomes that of asking : @xmath76 is large compared to what ?",
    "if it is now recognized that @xmath76 is not large compared to the @xmath50 range of @xmath77 after the widening due to @xmath49 smearing ( remarked at the end of the previous section ) is taken into account , then the need for a long - range dynamical correlation to account for the structure of @xmath65 is lost .",
    "we describe below a possible explanation based on the second option of no long - range correlation .",
    "the key is to accept the suggestion of the data that the unmodified longitudinal component @xmath70 is sufficient .",
    "a series of articles have treated the subject of ridge formation in the recombination model @xcite , beginning with ( a ) the early observation of pedestal in jet correlation @xcite , to ( b ) its effects on azimuthal anisotropy of single - particle  at mid - rapidity @xcite , and then to ( c ) the dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath78 of the trigger relative to the reaction plane @xcite .",
    "forward productions in d - au and au - au collisions have also been studied in @xcite .",
    "our consideration here of ridge formation at @xmath79 is an extension of earlier studies with the common theme that ridges are formed as a consequence of energy loss by semihard or hard partons as they traverse the medium .",
    "the details involve careful treatment of the hadronization process with attention given to both the longitudinal and transverse components .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence has been studied thoroughly in @xcite , and the @xmath1 dependence should take into account of the experimental fact that the @xmath42 ratio can be large @xmath80 at large @xmath1 @xcite so that @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) can be properly reproduced .",
    "we give in this subsection a brief summary of the @xmath6  that we have obtained previously in our treatment of the ridge formation @xcite .",
    "in so doing we also explain more thoroughly an aspect of the basic elements of our model .",
    "the tenets of our interpretation of the ridge structure are that its formation is due to ( a ) the passage of a semihard parton through the medium , and ( b ) the conversion of the energy loss by the parton to the thermal energy of the soft partons in the vicinity of its trajectory .",
    "hadronization of the enhanced thermal partons at small rapidity forms the ridge standing above the background . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have considered the geometry of the trajectory of a semihard parton traversing the medium in the transverse plane at mid - rapidity , @xmath81 , taking into account the azimuthal angle @xmath78 of the trajectory that is to be identified with the trigger direction relative to the reaction plane . along that trajectory , labeled by points @xmath82 in the transverse plane , the medium expands in the direction @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath83 is approximately equal to @xmath78 for most of the points @xmath82 along the trajectory of the semihard parton , then the thermal partons enhanced by successive soft emissions are carried by the flow along in the same direction ; the effects reinforce one another and lead to the formation of a ridge in a narrow cone . on the other hand ,",
    "if the two directions are orthogonal , then the soft partons emitted from the various points along the trajectory are dispersed over a range of surface area , so their hadronization leads to no pronounced effect .",
    "these extreme possibilities suggest a correlation function between @xmath78 and @xmath84 , which we assume to have the gaussian form @xmath85 \\ ,    \\label{7a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the width - squared @xmath86 is a parameter to be determined .",
    "this correlation is the central element of our correlated emission model ( cem ) @xcite .",
    "considerable care is given to the calculation of the observed ridge yield @xmath87 as a function of @xmath78 .",
    "it involves integrations over the path length of the trajectory of the semihard parton and its point of creation in the medium whose density depends on nuclear overlap , etc . to compare with the data on @xmath87 we also have to integrate over all @xmath7 of the ridge particle .",
    "it is found that by adjusting the value of @xmath86 it is possible to fit the data on @xmath87 in the entire range @xmath88 for both 0 - 5% and 20 - 60% centralities .",
    "the value determined is @xmath89 , corresponding to a width @xmath90 rad , which is much smaller than the width of the ridge itself , @xmath91 .",
    "we have been able to show that using @xmath89 the calculated  of the ridge @xmath92 agrees well with the data .",
    "we further made a prediction on the existence of an asymmetry property of the ridge @xmath93 in its @xmath7 dependence relative to @xmath78 .",
    "that prediction was subsequently verified by the star data @xcite .    the mechanism for @xmath7 correlation described above will form the basis of transverse correlation when we move away from mid - rapidity to @xmath94 .",
    "it is necessary , however , to start the consideration with a discussion of the forward - moving soft partons relative to the semihard partons at early time .",
    "we now extend the mechanism for ridge formation at mid - rapidity described above to @xmath94 .",
    "of course , without examining @xmath95 at @xmath96 one can not strictly refer to the structure at @xmath97 as ridge , which by definition has a flat  in @xmath0 , but is restricted in @xmath98 .",
    "we have actually considered the @xmath0 behavior before we investigated the @xmath6 structure at a time when the ridge was referred to as pedestal @xcite .",
    "calculation was done in the framework where the trigger is formed by thermal - shower recombination and the associated particles in the ridge by the recombination of enhanced thermal partons . in view of our present phenomenological finding in fig .  2 and expressed in eqs .  (",
    "[ 3 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) , we reformulate our model here with attention given to the initial configuration relevant to the problem at hand .    in the preceding subsection we have discussed the correlation between the semihard parton at @xmath78 and the local flow direction at @xmath83 , expressed in eq .",
    "( [ 7a ] ) for @xmath81 . to extend the same mechanism to @xmath94 ,",
    "it is important to recognize first that the longitudinal momenta of the hadrons produced outside the mid - rapidity region are not generated by the semihard parton , as it would be ruled out simply by energy conservation . in accordance to the original parton model @xcite , the right- and left - moving partons in the initial configuration provide the main thrust for forward and backward momenta .",
    "to be more quantitatively pertinent to the ridge structure observed in @xcite , let us recall that the pseudo - rapidity ranges of the trigger and ridge particles are @xmath99 and @xmath100 . for the sake of discussing positive momentum fractions , let us reverse the signs of @xmath1 without loss of generality , and regard @xmath101 and @xmath102 so that @xmath103 .",
    "let us be generous and set @xmath104 ; it corresponds to @xmath105 .",
    "that is , a ridge particle has @xmath106 . assuming an average @xmath107 gev / c implies @xmath108 gev / c .",
    "the coalescing quarks that form a pion at such a @xmath109 would have on average a longitudinal momentum of @xmath110 gev / c ( even less for a proton ) . for @xmath111",
    "gev , the corresponding momentum fraction @xmath14 of the quarks is @xmath112 .",
    "that is not a large-@xmath14 soft parton , being very nearly in the wee region @xcite .",
    "thus the kinematics of the particles in the ridge does not indicate that the coalescing quarks are very much in the forward ( or backward ) fragmentation region .    for @xmath113 gev the lorentz contraction factor",
    "is sometimes taken to be @xmath114 , but that corresponds to @xmath115 , where no quarks exist . if we take the average valence - quark momentum fraction to be @xmath116 , then the corresponding @xmath117 is @xmath118 and @xmath119 fm , which has a width that is not very thin .",
    "when two such slabs overlap in the initial configuration , the wee partons of the au - au colliding system can occupy a wider longitudinal space ( @xmath120 fm ) of uncertainty due to quantum fluctuations  1 fm on each side of the overlapping slabs consisting of soft parton with @xmath14 much smaller than @xmath121 .",
    "our point is then that in that space of @xmath120 fm in the initial configuration quantum fluctuations free us from requiring the soft partons to follow a hubble - like expansion , i.e. , the faster partons are on the outer edges of that longitudinal space , right - moving ones on the right side , and left - moving ones on the left .",
    "note that we have this freedom because we have not restricted ourselves to a dynamical picture of flux tube being stretched by receding thin disks , as in @xcite .    for a trigger particle to have @xmath122 gev / c the initiating semihard or hard parton must have @xmath123 gev / c and is created at early time . in fig .",
    "3 we show a sketch of the initial configuration in @xmath14-@xmath124 plane that depicts the relationship among various possible momentum vectors at that time .",
    "the horizontal thickness of the shaded region is @xmath120 fm and the vertical height is @xmath125 fm , thus not to scale .",
    "the central slab marked by a darker region of @xmath126 fm represents the longitudinal extent in which the valence quarks are contracted .",
    "the ( red ) arrow labeled @xmath127 is the semihard parton that initiates the trigger ; it starts from inside the narrow slab because the longitudinal momenta of the colliding partons before scattering are high .",
    "the two other ( blue ) arrows labeled @xmath128 and @xmath129 represent two possible soft partons with @xmath130 gev / c , originating from outside the inner slab , since their @xmath131 is larger than @xmath132 .",
    "we place those vectors in such positions to emphasize the possibility that they can originate from the opposite sides of the slab .",
    "that is what we mean by expansion at early time that is not of hubble - type .",
    "the conical region ( shaded green ) around vector @xmath127 represents the vicinity of the trajectory of the semihard parton where the thermal partons are enhanced due to the energy loss by the semihard parton .",
    "note that since the soft partons @xmath128 and @xmath129 have larger @xmath131 than that of the valence quarks , they can cross the conical region , so the transverse components of the soft partons can be broadened by their interaction with the enhanced thermal partons .",
    "the discussion above on the space - momentum relationship between the semihard and soft partons at early time in the uncertainty region @xmath131 gives the conceptual basis for our view of how hadrons in the ridge are formed at late time .",
    "our main point about the initial longitudinal uncertainty is that the forward - moving soft partons that eventually hadronize can be influenced by the semihard parton because the soft - parton trajectory starting from the left side of the central slab shown in fig .",
    "3 can traverse the cone of enhanced thermal partons . to be more quantitative",
    "we return to the general factorizable form of the single - particle  given in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) where @xmath60 refers to the transverse component @xmath32 of particle 2 .",
    "the effect of the semihard parton on particle 2 is the transverse broadening of the soft parton @xmath128 in fig .  3 , in much the same way that the cronin effect is conventionally explained in terms of initial - state broadening @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath69 in eq .  ( [ 7 ] ) is modified if ( a ) there is a semihard parton @xmath127 , and ( b ) @xmath128 ( and other soft partons not shown in fig .",
    "3 ) passes through the cone in the vicinity of @xmath127 .",
    "we denote the case without the semihard parton by @xmath133 representing the background , where v_b(p_2)=(-p_2/t_0 ) , [ 9a ] and the case with semihard parton and with @xmath7 in the vicinity of the cone by v_b+r(p_2)=(-p_2/t ) , [ 10a ] where @xmath134 is a result of the interaction with the enhanced thermal partons",
    ". then the ridge has a transverse component that rises above the background and has the @xmath135 dependence v_r(p_2)=v_b+r(p_2)-v_b(p_2 ) .",
    "[ 11a ] this is the essence of transverse broadening due to the presence of semihard parton . since the soft partons @xmath128 must pass through the enhanced cone ( narrow in @xmath7 ) in order to develop transverse broadening , they contribute to the ridge only within the @xmath6 interval around @xmath136 , discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "all of those fragments are in a small range of @xmath0 and have transverse - momentum fractions that are correlated .",
    "they populate the peak in fig .  2 . in our problem about the ridge we have been concerned with the transverse momentum of a particle associated with a trigger outside that peak .",
    "the former reveals the effect of the medium on the jet , while the latter reveals the effect of the jet on the medium .",

    ", we can summarize the characteristics of the ridge as being generated by the same dynamical mechanism at any @xmath1 in the range where single - particle distribution can reach .",
    "that mechanism depends on semihard or hard partons ( with or without trigger ) whose energy loss to the medium leads to transverse broadening of small-@xmath14 partons that encounter the enhanced region of thermal partons .",
    "the transverse - momentum distribution of the ridge particles is the same for any @xmath1 , and the @xmath1 range of the ridge is no more than that of the single - particle inclusive distribution because the partonic origin of the longitudinal momentum of any particle is the same .",
    "recently , an extension of similar consideration as described here has been applied to the study of ridge formation in @xmath5 collisions at lhc and succeeded in explaining the @xmath32 dependence of the ridge yield found by the cms collaboration at @xmath153 tev @xcite .",

    "( [ 3 ] ) , substantiated by figs .  1 and 2 , does not reveal any quantitative definition of what large @xmath0 means . to be able to relate large @xmath0 to dynamical long - range correlation",
    "is a worthy theoretical endeavor , but more can be added to its phenomenological relevance if it can also elucidate the empirical connection between the two sides of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the approach that we have taken involves no long - range longitudinal correlation for the ridge .",
    "the observed ridge  is interpreted in our approach as being due to transverse correlation with a range in @xmath0 that is no more than that of the single - particle .",
    "that is , the @xmath32 s of the detected hadrons in the ridge have a larger inverse slope than that of the particles outside , which have larger @xmath6 than the ridge width .",
    "we have described the partonic basis for how the transverse correlation at different @xmath1 depends on longitudinal fluctuations in the initial state .",
    "furthermore , without hard partons there can be no ridge associated with a trigger . in the absence of a trigger",
    "there is still a ridge component hidden in the single - particle distribution due to semihard partons that are more copiously produced than hard partons .",
    "the @xmath135 s of the ridge particles are essentially the same @xcite .",
    "if a hard ( or semihard ) scattering is likened to an earthquake , then the ridge is the counterpart of tsunami , and the thermal medium carrying the enhancement is the ocean water .",
    "transverse correlation is the rise in water level at various points along a coast hit by the tsunami .",
    "although the tsunami damage is insensitive to the horizontal separation among the coastal cities , it should not be interpreted as evidence for long - range horizontal ( longitudinal ) correlation .",
    "the buildings in different cities are not horizontally correlated , but their uprooting by vertical displacements is a sign of transverse correlation caused by the tsunami . similarly , there is transverse correlation at various points in the ridge but no long - range longitudinal correlation . where the analogy fails , as all analogies do at some point , is that our expanding system illustrated in fig .",
    "3 is not hubble - like in the initial configuration and that the soft partons must intersect the enhanced cone of the hard parton in order to carry the effect of enhancement at @xmath96 .",
    "that is where the restriction in @xmath6 enters in the ridge problem .",
    "there is no such complication in the earthquake / tsunami example , which is strictly a classical case of wave propagation .",
    "another point where the analogy may be misleading is that in the case of the tsunami the energy of wave propagation is provided entirely by the earthquake . in our problem",
    "the momenta of the forward - moving soft partons are in the initial state whether or not there is a hard ( or semihard ) scattering .",
    "they are the medium ; their transverse momenta can be enhanced to form a ridge in the same way that the ocean water can be perturbed by the earthquake to develop a tsunami , whose underlying medium , however , does not expand .",
    "note that in both cases the detection of trigger or earthquake is not essential in assessing the effect of ridge or tsunami .",
    "the main point of the analogy is to illustrate the meaning of transverse correlation at separated rapidities without longitudinal correlation ( and without suggesting similarity in dynamics ) .",
    "a crucial point in our interpretation of the ridge phenomenon is that the quantum fluctuation of the longitudinal coordinates of the initial configuration is important , as illustrated in fig .",
    "because of the possibility that low-@xmath14 partons with positive momenta do not necessarily have to be located on the positive side of the thinner slab to which the high-@xmath14 partons are contracted , the usual approximation that equates spatial rapidity with momentum rapidity should not be extended to the neighborhood of the tip of the forward light cone .",
    "fluctuations of the initial longitudinal configuration are not usually considered .",
    "in contrast , fluctuations of the initial transverse configuration have been investigated vigorously in recent years , leading to results according to hydrodynamical expansion that have significant phenomenological consequences on the transverse structure quantified by the azimuthal harmonics , one of which being the diminution of the ridge itself .",
    "here we find that longitudinal fluctuation of the initial parton configuration can be the source of the longitudinal structure in the ridge phenomenon .",
    "more detailed work is obviously needed to put on firmer footing the ideas initiated here .    to sum up , we have two important findings to emphasize .",
    "one is the phenomenological relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath8 .",
    "the other is an interpretation of that relationship in terms of transverse correlation without long - range longitudinal correlation .",
