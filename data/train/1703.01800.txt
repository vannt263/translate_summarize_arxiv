    "with the basis of orthogonal single - particle orbitals : @xmath18,@xmath19,@xmath20 , the many - body states of @xmath6 fock parafermions can be assumed as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the respective occupation numbers of the single particle orbitals and @xmath26 .",
    "the general structure of the fock space can be defined by @xmath27 in the following we use the abbreviated notation @xmath28 for single - particle states . by considering the non - trivial statistics of weyl parafermions",

    "their inverse transformations can also be derived , giving rise to the local transformations between the fock parafermions and weyl parafermions @xmath50interestingly , these transformations are linear for @xmath17 but become nonlinear for @xmath51 .",
    "finally , a charge operator on a lattice site can be defined by @xmath52 , which yields the relation between charge operator and the particle number operator of the fock parafermions .",
    "the global charge operator is thus given by @xmath53and the global charge in the basis of the fock space is determined by @xmath54then the charge of the many - body basis state @xmath55 denotes as latexmath:[$%    @xmath7 , while the charge of the basis state @xmath57 as @xmath58 .",
    "the tensor constructed by the graded tensor product of fock states with a definite charge has the total charge given by the summation of the charges of these states ( @xmath59 @xmath7 ) .",
    "for example , the total charge of the tensor @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 @xmath59 @xmath7 . since the @xmath6 parafermionic system with @xmath7 as a prime number always preserves the @xmath6 symmetry@xcite , which is generated by the total charge operator @xmath62",
    ", we expect that every parafermionic many - body state formed by a linear superposition of the same charge states should have a definite charge .",

    "one may think that a single fock parafermion is composed of two weyl parafermions , so the virtual degrees of freedom should be expressed by weyl parafermions .",
    "although we still use the fock representation to express the virtual degrees of freedom , these degrees of freedom of the virtual space are nevertheless fractionalized and describe fractionalized parafermionic zero modes at the ends of open chains .",
    "because the virtual states @xmath74 and @xmath75 are not independent , there is a constrain of a fixed charge value @xmath76 to construct the mps , we have to employ the unfractionalized degrees of freedom with a constrain of charge to restrict the degrees of freedom . for example , when the fermionic mps for the single majorana fermion chain with open boundary conditions are constructed , there are four different choices to fix the virtual degrees of freedom on two edges , but only two - fold ground state degeneracy is produced@xcite .        to manipulate the tensor network locally , we will always impose the constraint that all the local tensors @xmath72 $ ]  must have a well - defined charge , so that the different orders of the tensors in the graded tensor product will at most lead to a global phase of the many - body state . to ensure that the tensor @xmath72 $ ] has a definite charge , we must use the matrices @xmath72^{i}$ ] with a well - defined charge .",
    "we mainly focus on the translational invariant systems with the same @xmath77 $ ] on different sites and the site index will be omitted in the following .",
    "then we impose that the charge of the local tensor @xmath78 is zero so that the order of the individual tensors @xmath78 does not affect the definition of tensor network and its charge is independent on the lattice size .",
    "when we contract the virtual bonds by the mapping @xmath35 , we have the general parafermionic mps as @xmath79 ) \\\\ & = & \\sum_{i_{1} .. i_{n}}\\sum_{\\alpha \\beta } \\left ( a^{i_{1}}\\cdots a^{i_{l}}\\right ) _ { \\alpha \\beta } |\\alpha _ { 1})|i_{1}\\cdots i_{l}\\rangle ( \\beta _ { l+1}| ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]which has been shown in fig . [",
    "because the charges of @xmath80 and @xmath81 add up to zero , the contraction does not affect the charge of the state @xmath82 .",
    "finally , we can choose different boundary conditions to fix the virtual states at the boundaries . because the commutation relation of parafermions requires a definite order , the translation invariance on a closed chain is not well - defined .",
    "for any mps wave function , one can construct a local parent hamiltonian whose ground state is uniquely given by the mps . the general way to construct the parent hamiltonian",
    "is as follows .",
    "first we should block the consecutive @xmath83 sites so that the rank of the map @xmath84 with row indices @xmath85 and the column indices @xmath86 is smaller than @xmath87",
    ". then a local hamiltonian is obtained by projecting onto the space orthogonal to the image of this map . in physics ,",
    "the image of this map is the ground state subspace .",
    "since the operator @xmath88 is the orthogonal projector onto the image of @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the moore - penrose pseudo - inverse of the matrix @xmath89 , we can construct a gapped frustration free parent hamiltonian by adding all local projectors @xmath91where @xmath92 is the orthogonal projector onto the hilbert space orthogonal to the image of @xmath89 , the kernel of @xmath90 .",
    "then , if the local hamiltonian matrix is simple , i.e. , it only involves a few number of lattice sites , we can try to expand it with possible charge zero operators in terms of the parafermion modes defined on those lattice sites . neglecting the unnecessary terms , the simplified parent hamiltonian corresponding to the constructed mps wave function is thus obtained .",
    "following the general procedures of constructing mps with @xmath4 fock parafermions , the charges of elements of the local matrices @xmath93 ( the components of the local tensor ) are determined by @xmath94 @xmath59 @xmath95 , shown in tab.[table1 ] . to ensure that the local matrix @xmath96 has a definite charge ,",
    "we require that the matrix form of @xmath97 must have the following nine blocks structure : @xmath98which is determined by the graded structure of fock space .",
    ".the charges of different elements of @xmath96 , which reveal the graded structure of @xmath99 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     actually these matrices form a family of @xmath4 symmetric states , and all @xmath99 span a @xmath4 graded algebra .",
    "if we multiply some of these matrices @xmath100 together to get a blocked matrix @xmath101 with @xmath102 @xmath59 @xmath95 , the blocked matrix @xmath103 still satisfies the above conditions .",
    "the @xmath4 graded algebra is the consequence that the system must be @xmath4 symmetric , so the @xmath4 charge conserves and the states in the hilbert space must have a well - defined charge .",
    "hence the mps with different charges can not be connected smoothly .",
    "since the @xmath4 parafermionic system is intrinsically @xmath4 symmetric , the hilbert space is naturally a @xmath3 graded vector space , which is a generalization of super vector space for the @xmath1 case@xcite .",
    "a prototype parafermionic mps can be defined by the simplest matrices @xmath104the mps with open boundary conditions constructed by these matrices can be expressed as @xmath105where @xmath106 @xmath59 @xmath95 .",

    "[ table1 ] .",
    "specifically , they are equal wight superpositions of all basis states with the same charge @xmath109here we would like to emphasize that the summation has to satisfy the global constrain .",
    "similar mps state is also considered in the recent papermazza .    with the parafermionic mps wave functions , the transfer matrix @xmath110 which is shown graphically in fig .",
    "1(b ) can be defined , and we can calculate its eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "we surprisingly found that there is a unique eigenvalue with three - fold degeneracy , indicating the distinct property of the parafermionic mps . in the bosonic mps , however , the degeneracy of the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix stems from the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the ground state .",
    "but the @xmath4 symmetry can not be spontaneously broken in the parafermion chain .",
    "this result becomes the most striking difference between the bosonic and parafermionic mps . in this sense ,",

    "however , in terms of weyl parafermions , the parent hamiltonian just takes a simple form , the nearest neighbor hopping terms , and we can easily find that the weyl parafermions @xmath115 and @xmath116 characterize two edge parafermion zero modes on each end of the open chain .",
    "these edge parafermions are fractionalized from the physical degrees of freedom on the lattice sites .",
    "since we can not distinguish three ground states @xmath117 locally in the bulk , they are topologically non - trivial degenerate states . in addiction , via the generalized inverse jordan - wigner transformation , one can transform the above parent hamiltonian @xmath118 into the ferromagnetic @xmath4 clock model , whose ground state has a long - range order with three - fold degeneracy due to the spontaneous @xmath119 symmetry breaking .",
    "since the coupling parameters can be rotated by an angle @xmath120 , we further noticed that there are two other equivalent parent hamiltoniansh h tu @xmath121whose charges of their corresponding mps depend on the lattice size . this can be seen from the total charge operator @xmath122where the parafermionic operators on the adjacent sites define the bond charge  @xmath123 .",

    "as we pointed out , the @xmath175 symmetry is preserved for the mps under the closed boundary condition in the reducing procedure . for a closed boundary condition , the corresponding mps wave function",
    "can be expressed as@xmath188with the closure matrix @xmath133 which can be derived as well .",
    "we notice that the transfer matrix of @xmath189 is as same as that of @xmath190 .",
    "one may think that they belong to the same phase , but in our parafermionic case , they differ from each other in several aspects .",
    "for the open boundary conditions , if we choose the simple boundary conditions such as @xmath191 , the @xmath5 symmetry is broken and only @xmath4 symmetry is preserved , so both of them belong to the @xmath4 symmetric trivial phase .",
    "different from the first stacking case , another projective representations of the @xmath174 symmetry generators can be found @xmath192with @xmath193where the factor @xmath194 characterizes the mps @xmath189 but the mps @xmath195 is characterized by @xmath166 .",
    "both @xmath190 and @xmath189 represent two different topologically nontrivial phases protected by the @xmath175 symmetry .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding parent hamiltonian can also be found as @xmath196 , \\]]which is slightly different from the previous one @xmath168 and illustrated in fig.[twochainhamiltonian ] ( b ) .",
    "this parent hamiltonian also commutes with @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "similarly , by fractionalizing charge operators of two sublattices , we can find the edge parafermion zero modes as ( @xmath197 ) for the chain with @xmath170 sites and ( @xmath198 ) for the chain with @xmath172 sites , which commute with the parent hamiltonian . in terms of @xmath199 spin operators , @xmath200",
    "is further transformed into the following @xmath5 cluster model @xmath201whose ground state represents another spt phase protected by the @xmath177 symmetry . by a global unitary transformation without having @xmath5 symmetry@xcite",
    ", @xmath202 can be transformed into the previous one @xmath203 .",
    "the global unitary transformation can also be written in terms of parafermions directly , similar to eq.([w ] ) .",
    "again , we confirmed that the ground states of @xmath168 and @xmath200 belong to different spt phases with the @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "in the fock representation of @xmath4 parafermions , we have successfully constructed two topologically distinct classes of irreducible parafermionic mps , corresponding to the @xmath1 topological classification of parafermion chain and the center of algebra spanned by the local matrices .",
    "the nontrivial mps represents the fixed point models of the single @xmath4 parafermion chain , characterized by one parafermion on each end of an open chain .",
    "the corresponding transfer matrix has a unique eigenvalue with three - fold degeneracy , significantly different from that of the bosonic mps wave functions , where such a degeneracy implies the symmetry breaking phase and the mps is reducible .",
    "but in the parafermionic case , it is irreducible and there is no symmetry breaking .",
    "the trivial type parafermionic mps wave functions obtaining by stacking of two single parafermion chains have two edge parafermions on each end of an open chain and usually display @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "hence they are parafermionic spt phases protected by @xmath204 symmetry , much similar to the bosonic spt phases for the two - coupled @xmath5 cluster models",
    ".    our general framework can be easily generalized to construct the @xmath205 symmetric mps for the one - dimensional parafermionic topological phases with @xmath7 as a prime number , where the appearance of symmetry breaking in non - prime @xmath7 cases gives rise to some complexity .",
    "when additional symmetries are introduced into the @xmath4 parafermionic chains , we can classify all the possible topological phases within the framework of the mps representation .",
    "moreover , we can also generalize the tensor product states for topological phases of parafermions in more than one spatial dimension .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that explorations of topological phases with parafermions are not purely academic .",
    "recently some plausible experimental routes to trapping parafermionic excitations have been proposed in presently available condensed matter systems , and these platforms can provide topological qubits with both better protected against environmental noise and richer fault - tolerant qubit rotations compared to the majorana - based systems@xcite ."
