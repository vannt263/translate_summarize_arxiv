    "understanding the nature of dark matter remains a fundamental problem in astrophysics and cosmology . since the discovery of neutrinos non - zero rest mass @xcite , the possibility that neutrinos contribute to cosmological dark matter has become a hot topic again .",
    "in particular , the sterile neutrinos are a class of candidate dark matter particles with no standard model interaction . although the recent miniboone result challenges the lsnd result that suggests the existence of ev scale sterile neutrinos @xcite , more massive sterile neutrinos ( eg .  kev ) may still exist .",
    "the fact that active neutrinos have rest mass implies that right - handed neutrinos should exist which may indeed be massive sterile neutrinos with rest mass @xmath3 .",
    "recently , it was proposed that a degenerate sterile neutrino halo exists in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "later , this model is ruled out with the availability of more precise data , particularly those on orbits of stars such as s2 near the milky way center @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of such a sterile neutrino halo at the centers of protogalaxies may still be possible .",
    "sterile neutrinos decay into lighter neutrinos and photons , and provide mass to fuel the growth of supermassive blackholes .",
    "however , since most of these sterile neutrinos may have either decayed or fallen into the supermassive blackhole , the total mass of the sterile neutrino halo at the galactic center becomes very small ( @xmath4 ) at present .",
    "moreover , the existence of decaying sterile neutrinos may help to solve the cooling flow problem in clusters @xcite as well as reionization in the universe @xcite .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile to discuss the consequences of the existence of massive sterile neutrinos at the centers of protogalaxies , which decay into light neutrinos and photons .    on the other hand ,",
    "recent observations have led to some tight relations between the central black hole masses @xmath5 and velocity dispersions @xmath6 in the bulges of galaxies .",
    "these relations can be summarized as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is found to be @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite by two different groups .",
    "@xcite reanalysed both sets of data and obtained @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these results indicate that blackhole formation may be related to galaxy formation , which challenges existing galaxy formation theories @xcite .",
    "this relation has been derived in recent theoretical models @xcite .",
    "we assume that a degenerate sterile neutrino halo exists in the center of a protogalaxy .",
    "there are two different decay modes for sterile neutrinos @xmath13 .",
    "the major decaying channel is @xmath14 with decay rate @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the fermi constant and mixing angle of sterile neutrino with active neutrinos respectively .",
    "the minor decaying channel is @xmath18 with decay rate @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath8 is the fine structure constant .",
    "it is quite difficult to detect the active neutrinos produced in the major decaying channel .",
    "therefore , we focus on observational consequence of the radiative decay of the sterile neutrinos with rest mass @xmath20 kev .",
    "they emit high energy photons ( @xmath21 ) which heat up the surrounding gas so that hydrostatic equilibrium of the latter is maintained .",
    "the sterile neutrino halo also provides mass to form a supermassive blackhole from a small seed blackhole . without any further assumption ,",
    "@xmath22 is consistent with the range of the decay rate obtained by observational data from cooling flow clusters . in this article",
    ", we first give a brief review on three popular analytic models that explain the @xmath23 relation .",
    "then we will give a detailed description of our model and compare it with other existing models .",
    "@xcite presented a model to explain the @xmath24 relation .",
    "he assumed that the gas density profile of a protogalaxy is isothermal ( @xmath25 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore the gas mass inside radius @xmath26 is : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the cosmological ratio of baryon to total mass , assumed to be the same in a galaxy , and the virial theorem is used . consider a super - eddington accretion onto a seed blackhole .",
    "the accretion feedback produces a momentum - driven superbubble that sweeps ambient gas into a thin shell which expands to the galaxy .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath29 +   \\frac{gm(r)[m_{bh}(t)+m(r)]}{r^2}=\\frac{l_{edd}}{c},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the opacity and @xmath32 the mass of the central blackhole at time @xmath33 . integrating twice and assuming @xmath34 , one gets : @xmath35 where @xmath36 at @xmath37 , with @xmath38 some large radius ( @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the maximum radius @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 when @xmath32 approaches @xmath43 , @xmath41 becomes very large such that the cooling of the shocked wind is inefficient as the cooling time @xmath44 and the accretion is stopped as the shell can escape the galaxy entirely by gas pressure @xcite .",
    "therefore , given an adequate mass supply ( such as in a merger ) , we get @xcite @xmath45 here , the proportionality constant @xmath46 lies within the observational constraints . to summarize ,",
    "the @xmath23 relation is obtained with three important assumptions : ( 1 ) isothermal gas density distribution throughout the galaxy formation , ( 2 ) super eddington accretion , and ( 3 ) an adequate mass supply .",
    "@xcite obtained a relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 by assuming that the density and velocity distributions of matter are self - similar .",
    "they assumed that the galaxy is formed by the extended collapse of a halo composed of collisionless matter .",
    "the central blackhole is grown proportionally to the halo as matter continues to fall in .",
    "the relation is given by @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath8 are scales in space and time respectively , and their ratio is related to the power - law index of the initial density perturbation @xmath49 in the spherical infall model of halo growth @xcite : @xmath50 the power - law index @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the index of the primordial matter power spectrum @xmath53 . if @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( 8) agrees with the observation @xmath55 .",
    "this model involves a relation eq .",
    "( 9 ) which is quite model dependent .",
    "@xcite assume the dark matter and baryons to be unsegregated and the isothermal initial mass density distribution ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the specific orbital energy is conserved when the particles fall into the small seed blackhole : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the radial velocity and angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "when the particles fall into the equatorial plane , their pericenters are @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the average angular speed of the particles . in the early stage ,",
    "all the particles fall into the blackhole until the blackhole mass reaches a critical point that corresponds to @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the schwarzschild radius .",
    "this gives the final relation @xcite @xmath65 this model is based on the assumption of the isothermal distribution of matter , and there is a free parameter @xmath61 , which is assumed to have the same value for all galaxies .",
    "suppose the sterile neutrino halo dominates the mass in the proto - galactic center , most of the mass in the blackhole comes from the sterile neutrino halo with radius @xmath66 , which was formed in the very early universe @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the total mass of the degenerate sterile neutrino halo at time @xmath68 is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mass density of the sterile neutrino halo .",
    "assume that a seed blackhole with mass @xmath71 of order solar mass is formed at @xmath68 , long after the formation of the sterile neutrino halo .",
    "it would grow by accreting mass of the sterile neutrino halo to mass @xmath32 at time @xmath33 .",
    "as some sterile neutrinos would be accreted by the seed blackhole , the degenerate pressure is decreased and more sterile neutrinos will fall into the blackhole as their fermi speed is less than their escape speed @xcite .",
    "the falling time scale at distance @xmath72 from the blackhole in a free falling model is given by @xcite @xmath73}}.\\ ] ] for @xmath74 , @xmath20 kev and @xmath75 pc , @xmath76 years for @xmath77 , which is much shorter than the hubble time .",
    "therefore , we do not need any intermediate mass blackholes since the small seed blackhole can grow to a @xmath78 supermassive blackhole rapidly as long as there is enough mass in the initial sterile neutrino halo . in the following ,",
    "we assume that all sterile neutrinos fall into the blackhole and decay into active neutrinos and photons , and so @xmath79 .",
    "the photons emitted by the original decaying sterile neutrinos provide energy to the gas in the protogalaxies by compton scattering .",
    "the optical depth of a decayed photon in the bulge is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the @xmath82-band effective bulge radius @xcite , @xmath83 is compton scattering cross section and @xmath84 is the mean number density of the gas . in equilibrium , the heating rate is equal to the cooling rate by bremsstrahlung radiation @xmath85 , recombination @xmath86 and adiabatic expansion @xmath87 .",
    "we have @xcite @xmath88v+pv^{2/3}c_s,\\ ] ] where @xmath89 erg s@xmath90 , @xmath91 erg s@xmath90 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the sound speed , pressure and total volume of the gas within @xmath81 respectively .",
    "the @xmath23 relation can be obtained by using eq .",
    "( 15 ) and the virial theorem numerically .",
    "nevertheless , we first illustrate the idea by obtaining analytic relations in two different regimes .",
    "suppose @xmath95 ; if @xmath96 , the resulting temperature is above @xmath97 k and the total cooling rate is dominated by @xmath87 .",
    "for @xmath98 , the resulting temperature is lower and the total cooling rate is dominated by @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( see fig .  1 ) .    in the optically thick regime ,",
    "@xmath96 and @xmath99 , and we get @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mean mass of a gas particle . by using the virial theorem @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the effective bulge mass of the protogalaxy within @xmath81 , and substituting @xmath104 , we get @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the adiabatic index of the gas and @xmath107 is a constant that depends on the density distribution of the protogalaxy . as time passes , the energy gained by the gas would decrease gradually and the mass distribution at the center would change slightly also . if the supermassive blackhole was formed when the galaxy formation was nearly completed ( @xmath108 s ) , the ratio @xmath109 and the velocity dispersion do not change significantly .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( 17 ) , the ratio @xmath109 is fixed by @xmath110 and @xmath111 . by using the virial theorem again and assuming spherical symmetry",
    ", one can relate this ratio with the final bulge velocity dispersion after the supermassive blackhole is formed , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a constant that depends on the mass distribution at present .",
    "combining eq .",
    "( 17 ) and eq .  ( 18 ) , we get @xmath114    in the optically thin regime , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the total power absorbed by the gas in the protogalaxies within @xmath81 is @xmath117 .",
    "if the cooling rate is dominated by bremsstrahlung radiation , in equilibrium , we get @xmath118 by using the virial theorem and eq .  ( 18 ) , we obtain @xmath119 if the cooling rate is dominated by recombination , in equilibrium and for @xmath120 k , we get @xmath121 and @xmath122 therefore , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are closely related in both optically thick and thin regimes .",
    "we use 500 random data in the ranges of @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath108 s , @xmath126 and @xmath127 kpc @xmath128 kpc to generate the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 by using eq .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 18 ) ( see fig .  2 ) . by using @xmath129 s@xmath90 which solves the cooling flow problem @xcite",
    ", the decay rate obtained in this paper should correspond to @xmath130 .",
    "] and @xmath131 , we get @xmath132 which agrees with the recent observation : @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .    as an order of magnitude estimate , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the neutrino dirac mass . in the standard see - saw mechanism",
    ", @xmath134 is the geometric mean of the light neutrino mass - scale @xmath135 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath136 . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we get @xmath137 for @xmath138 s@xmath90 , @xmath139 kev for @xmath140 ev , which is consistent with our assumption ( @xmath20 kev ) .",
    "we assume the existence of a degenerate neutrino halo ( @xmath141 kev ) at the proto - galactic center with a parameter , @xmath130 , which is universal and can be inferred from observation of cluster hot gas @xcite . without any assumptions of the protogalaxy and existence of any intermediate mass blackohles , @xmath1 and @xmath2 require the total decay rate to be @xmath142 s@xmath90 , which is consistent with the observational data from cooling flow clusters @xcite .",
    "also , we have reviewed several models to explain the @xmath24 relation .",
    "these models require several assumptions or free parameters which may not be true for all galaxies .",
    "for example , king s model assumes the isothermal density profile ( @xmath143 ) for all galaxies during all the time of the blackhole formation .",
    "if the density profile changes into the form @xmath144 , then @xmath145 which is not a constant .",
    "this problem also exists in the ballistic model which is based on the isothermal distribution of matter . on the other hand , in the self - similar model",
    ", there are several free parameters which are model dependent .",
    "also one can not obtain the proportionality constant @xmath146 of the @xmath23 relation .",
    "we have considered a wide range of @xmath147 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 encompassing almost all possibilities in galaxies . in our model , we assume that the supermassive blackhole was formed at the epoch when the galaxy formation was nearly completed ( @xmath108 s ) so that the velocity dispersion does not change significantly between @xmath68 and present . therefore our result is valid only for supermassive blackholes formed nearly at the end of the galaxy formation , same as in the super eddington accretion and ballistic model .",
    "the assumed existence of a decaying sterile neutrino halo inside each galactic center provides enough mass to form the supermassive blackhole .",
    "it can also solve the cooling flow problem in clusters @xcite and explain the reionization of the universe @xcite , all with the same decay rate @xmath148 s@xmath90 and @xmath20 kev , which are consistent with the standard see - saw mechanism .",
