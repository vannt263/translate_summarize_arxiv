    "as it is well known , an extremely important finding of the last decade has been the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "this was rather a surprise , mainly based on the observation of luminosity distance of type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the picture which seems to emerge from the data is that of an universe which has undergone a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase , with a relatively recent turning point located at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this framework seems to be confirmed by cross - comparison with other pieces of evidence @xcite .",
    "the discovery gave start to an active search for an explanation on the theoretical side , within and outside general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "an immediate effect was to revive the old cosmological constant , @xmath0 costante ; afterwards , a number of evolutionary sons of @xmath0 or new exotic fields were elaborated , mostly based on the idea of `` dark energy '' @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . also",
    "various possibilities of alternative , modified or extended versions of gr have actively been explored @xcite .    here , our purpose is to review the existing observational data and some proposed fits , comparing them one with another and with the results of a recently introduced four - vector theory , that we shall call the `` cosmic defect '' theory , cd for short @xcite . the cd theory , which has also correspondences in the group of the so called vector `` ether '' theories vector ,",
    "will also be revised and recast in the following .    whenever a theory is contrasted with the data from experience ( here , from observation ) one has to face a number of different problems .",
    "first of all , comes the reliability and cleanness of the data : we shall not elaborate on this , assuming the discussion to have been effectively conducted in the literature @xcite .",
    "a second subtle issue is that , even in presenting apparently raw data , underlying assumptions often exist , originating in one or another theoretical view : as far as possible , we shall try to express the existing information in a model - independent way .",
    "finally any theory usually has ( a number of ) free parameters to adjust , in order to fit the experiment ; of course the more parameters you have , the more you will be able to reproduce a given empirical trend , however any choice must be checked for consistency in as many different physical situations as possible .",
    "as we shall see , the cd theory gives a reasonably good fit for the snia data , making use of a limited number of parameters and , in the same time , offers an interpretation paradigm based on correspondences with known physical phenomena without the need of calling in new dark entities .",
    "in the framework of the supernovae observations , a key role is played by the concept of luminosity distance , @xmath2 , which is defined as @xmath3@xmath4 is the absolute luminosity of the source ( released energy per unit time ) corresponding to the @xmath5 value measured by the observer , @xmath6 is the energy flux density ( energy per unit time and surface ) measured at the observer s site . in an expanding universe",
    "both energy and time are affected by the expansion so that the effective luminosity for the observer , in terms of the absolute luminosity at the source is @xcite:@xmath7 in an universe endowed with the typical robertson walker ( rw ) symmetries ( [ dl ] ) becomes @xmath8where @xmath9 is the scale parameter at the observer , and @xmath10 is the coordinate distance of the source from the observer .",
    "the latter , written in terms of the distance travelled by a light ray , is in turn@xmath11where of course @xmath12 is the cosmic time . in terms of the redshift and the scale factor",
    "we may also write @xmath13where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath12 and @xmath14 is the hubble parameter .",
    "it is then easily seen that the luminosity distance is@xmath15    usually astronomical objects are classified in terms of their magnitude @xmath16 , rather than their luminosity . by definition , the bolometric magnitude ( integrated over all frequencies )",
    "depends logarithmically on the luminosity distance , according to the formula : @xmath17where distances are expressed in mpc and it is @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is usually called the `` distance modulus '' .    the integral in ( [ magnitudo1 ] ) depends of course on the model one uses to describe the cosmic expansion . for a dust filled universe in a typical friedman - robertson - walker ( frw )",
    "scenario it is indeed @xmath21{6\\pi g\\rho _ { m0}}t^{2/3 } ,   \\label{friedman}\\]]being @xmath22 the present matter energy density and @xmath23 the gravitation constant .    as a consequence one expects@xmath24   \\label{frw}\\ ] ]    if one considers a @xmath0-cold - dark - matter universe ( @xmath25 ) , i.e. an frw universe with a cosmological constant @xmath0 , it is@xmath26where @xmath27 represents the ratio between the matter density and the critical density ( ensuring the flatness of space ) .",
    "the difference @xmath28 allows for the effect of the cosmological constant .",
    "formula ( [ lcdm ] ) is a special case of the more general @xmath29allowing for any number of components of the content of the universe , with different equations of state .",
    "the cd theory is based on the presence of a cosmic ( four)-vector field in the universe .",
    "this vector field is interpreted as the strain flux density in a continuum with a pointlike defect nostro .",
    "the pointlike nature of the defect induces the rw symmetry ; this very symmetry , together with the defect paradigm , implies the vector to be `` radial '' , i.e. everywhere parallel to the cosmic time axis , and divergence - free , except at the defect .",
    "the norm of the vector , @xmath30 , will coincide with the absolute value of its time component and , according to the divergence - free feature , will be:@xmath31where @xmath32 is a constant and @xmath33 is the scale factor of the rw metric .",
    "the other relevant feature of the cd  theory is in the choice of the lagrangian for the spacetime containing the defect .",
    "this choice is inspired by the correspondence between the ( bidimensional ) phase - space of a rw universe and the one of a point particle moving through a viscous fluid nostro . including the presence of `` matter '' ( i.e. whatever is not accounted for by spacetime ) , the action integral is@xmath34with @xmath35 and @xmath36 explicitly introducing the rw symmetry and considering matter in terms of scalar functions , the lagrangian read out of ( [ azione ] ) is:@xmath37 ,   \\label{lagra0}\\]]where @xmath38 is the part of the lagrangian which is not affected by any variation with respect to the metric , and , in the flat @xmath39 case ( polar coordinates ) , equals @xmath40 .",
    "the presence of matter is represented by two scalar functions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , coupling to spacetime through the constants @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath41 function accounts for a possible coupling to the rate of expansion of the universe , @xmath45 .",
    "the second derivative of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath12 , appearing in ( [ lagra0 ] ) , is easily eliminated , once the action is integrated by parts , thus giving a final effective lagrangian of the universe    @xmath46 .",

    "\\label{hamil}\\ ] ]    as usual , @xmath48 can be interpreted as the energy content of the system described by the effective lagrangian ( [ lagreff ] ) , so that in our case it represents the energy content of the universe .",

    "@xmath74 is @xmath75 .",
    "in order to compare theory and observation we make reference to the same set of data used recently by davis et al . @xcite and incorporating supernovae analyzed in four different groups : 60 from the essence ( equation of state : supernovae trace cosmic expansion ) project @xcite , 57 from snls ( supernova legacy survey ) @xcite , 45 nearby supernovae , 30 detected by the hubble space telescope and qualified as `` golden '' supernovae by riess et al . @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we shall not enter into the discussion of the elaboration of the data , but assume them exactly the way they are published or anyway accessible considering them as the best available at the moment .",
    "altogether we use the luminosity data from 192 snia @xcite which we try to fit with theoretical models .",
    "first we use ( [ frw ] ) and obtain the result shown on fig .",

    "fit of distance modulus observations using a standard dust filled friedman - robertson - walker universe .",
    "the data are from 192 snia s as explained in the text .",

    ". the uncertainty on the redshift parameter @xmath5 would be unperceivable at the scale of the graph .",
    "the reduced @xmath78 is 2.1276 .",
    ", width=13 ]    the direct inspection of the graph shows that the data correspond to systematically lower luminosities than the ones given by the frw model , whence the accelerated expansion interpretation comes",
    ".    the next step will be to test on the data the @xmath25 model in its simplest version .",
    "to that purpose we use ( [ magnitudo1 ] ) and ( [ lcdm ] ) . in practice@xmath79the result , as it is well known , is better than before , since the reduced @xmath80 now is @xmath81 with a best fitting @xmath82 , which correspons to @xmath83 km / s@xmath84mpc , and @xmath85 , i.e. 27% of ordinary and dark matter plus 73% of dark energy ( cosmological constant ) in a spatially flat universe . for the optimization as well as for the determination of the uncertainty of the values of the parameters ,",
    "use has been made , as for the previous frw case , of a multidimensional nonlinear minimization by means of the minuit engine @xcite .",
    "the optimization is made minimizing the reduced @xmath78 of the fit .",
    "finally we test the cd theory .",
    "use is made of ( [ magnitudo1 ] ) and ( perilfit ) considering dust and radiation , so that    @xmath86 } { \\left ( 1+\\zeta \\right ) ^{3}\\left ( 1+\\varepsilon _ { 0}\\left ( 1+\\zeta \\right ) -b\\right ) } } d\\zeta   \\label{cd}\\ ] ]    we could treat @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath74 as optimization parameters , however the value to be introduced for @xmath89 is the one currently agreed upon , excluding any dark contribution : @xmath90 .",
    "of course as far as @xmath5 is in the order of a few units ( as it is the case for snia s ) the radiation term in the denominator of the integrand is negligible , so that also the contribution of @xmath74 may be embedded in @xmath87 and the free parameters remain @xmath87 and @xmath88 only .",
    "the result of the optimization process is @xmath91 and @xmath92 ; the reduced @xmath78 is @xmath93 , almost as good as for @xmath25 .",

    "[ frwgraph ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath94 is 1.092.,width=13 ]      the meaning of the choice of snia s for cosmological analyses relies on the assumption that they are `` standard candles '' , which means that the relation between their light curve and luminosity is thought to be always the same , now as well as at epochs corresponding to high cosmic redshifts ( actually , at the moment , the highest redshift for an snia corresponds to @xmath95 ) .",
    "if it is so , in an expanding universe we expect any standard candle ( as an snia is assumed to be ) to appear dimmer and redder according to the peculiar expansion law .",
    "indeed the currently assumed explosion mechanism for ia - type supernovae makes their peak luminosity be proportional to the mass of nickel synthesized , which , to a good approximation , is a fixed fraction of the chandrasekhar mass @xcite .",
    "the chandrasekhar mass , in its turn , is proportional to @xmath96 @xcite . in an expanding universe it is reasonable to expect that an effective value of @xmath23 , somehow accounting for the expansion , must replace the usual constant in the formulae we use to describe locally the behaviour of matter under gravity .",
    "if it is so a consequence is that the absolute magnitude of a source at a given @xmath5 differs from the one for @xmath97 . in practice ,",
    "including the fact that the extension of the light curve ( characteristic time ) of an snia is approximately proportional to the square root of the chandrasekhar limit @xcite , it is @xmath98and the distance modulus becomes :    @xmath99    for the above reason it is important , in any model we use in order to describe the evolution of the universe , to determine the explicit form of @xmath100 .",
    "this is indeed a delicate task , since everything has to be worked out in terms of appropriate approximations .",
    "attempts have been made to solve this problem in general terms for any scalar - tensor theory leading to acceptable results for limited ranges of @xmath5 values nesseris .",
    "we would like to follow a different path .",
    "actually at the scale of a stellar system the effect of the cosmic curvature appears only as a very tiny perturbation of the usual stationary state solutions of general relativity .",
    "considering for instance the example of a spherically distributed bunch of matter in a background rw universe , we expect that locally the induced metric be essentially @xmath101with an extremely weak dependence of @xmath41 and @xmath42 on time also . if @xmath102 is the given cosmic time we use @xmath103 as the time variable now .",
    "far away from the local source it must be @xmath41 , @xmath104 so that the pure rw metric is recovered .",
    "on the other side if it were @xmath105 constant we could incorporate its value in the definition of @xmath106 and from the field equations we would obtain the schwarzschild solution @xmath107 .    as written above ,",
    "@xmath9 may be absorbed into a rescaling of @xmath106 and similarly @xmath108 may be included into @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "now we may think to develop @xmath109 @xmath110 and @xmath42 in a power series of @xmath111 ; if we do so , including the condition @xmath41 , @xmath112 , we end up @xcite with the interesting result that the zero order ( in the typical evolution times of the gravitational phenomena we wish to describe ) is independent from such parameters as hubble s . in practice rapid events , such as",
    "the accretion of matter preluding to a gravitational collapse , always happen to be controlled by the universal value of @xmath23 and no correction is expected on the distance modulus .",
    "any effect of the expansion of the universe ( differentiating one model from another ) emerges only for times comparable to the cosmic evolution times .",
    "reconsidering now the explicit spelling of the parameters appearing in the cd theory used to draw fig .",
    "[ cd4fit ] we see that it is@xmath113whence@xmath114the `` visible '' matter density in the universe is commonly assumed to be around @xmath115 kg / m@xmath116 which means that @xmath74 must be @xmath117 .    then",
    ", introducing ( [ rom0 ] ) into ( [ perilfit ] ) and evaluating for @xmath97 we obtain @xmath118which is an acceptable result ( @xmath89 has been neglected with respect to @xmath74 ) .",
    "the corresponding hubble time is 15.6 gy .",
    "of course we should determine the age of the universe using the cd model ; this can be done by means of ( [ dustpiurad ] ) by integration :    @xmath119 } } d\\xi \\\\ & = & \\allowbreak \\left ( 9.\\,\\allowbreak 0\\pm 0.2\\right ) \\text { gy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the final numerical result has been obtained neglecting @xmath120 with respect to the other terms in the denominator of the integrand .",
    "the value falls rather short as compared to the age of globular clusters , which fact may probably be interpreted as an inadequacy of the model at very early cosmic times .",
    "we have fitted the apparent luminosity data from snia s with the values predicted by the @xmath0cdm and the cd theories , comparing both with a traditional frw universe .",
    "the result is of course partly known , but we see now that also cd improves with respect to frw and gives a fit comparable with the one of @xmath0cdm . using the same data and the same number of parameters we obtained similar values of the riduced @xmath78 s suggesting the idea that cd also is a viable theory .",
    "it is however true that the apparently small difference of the reduced @xmath78 s of the fits corresponds to a rather big difference in the full @xmath78 that , when analyzed on the light of statistical information criteria , such as the akaike information criterion ( aic ) @xcite and the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) @xcite , enhances the distance between the two theories in favor of @xmath0cdm . in the same time it is also true",
    "that both reduced values of @xmath78 are bigger than @xmath121 ; furthermore the @xmath122 values obtained from observation using different methods are systematically higher than the ones of the @xmath76-parameters best fits above . the most recent data from wmap  @xcite yield @xmath123 km / s@xmath84mpc which is consistent with a number of other results produced by different methods and indicators ( like sni , snii , cepheids in nearby galaxies , sunyaev - zeldovitch effect , x rays from clusters , gravitationally lensed systems ) all quoted in @xcite .",
    "the central values from these different observations range from @xmath124 to @xmath125 km / s@xmath84mpc and in general the historical evolution of the estimated values of the hubble constant seems to progressively converge towards something around @xmath126 km / s@xmath84mpc , which is @xmath127 more than the results got by means of the fits in this paper .",
    "if the `` experimental '' value of @xmath122 were used in the fits ( so reduced to @xmath121-parameter ones ) the agreement with the data would consistently worsen both for @xmath0cdm and for cd . in practice",
    "there is something missing beyond the details of the theories and their interpretation , which deserves investigation and insight .",
    "the @xmath0cdm is indeed different from the cd theory : the former assumes in the universe the presence of a cosmological constant corresponding to a sort of uniformly and homogeneously distributed dark energy ;  the latter interprets space - time as a continuum with a cosmic defect inducing a strained state containing both the symmetry and the non - uniform expansion rate .",
    "besides this , we know that @xmath0cdm requires also that the matter content in the universe be one order of magnitude bigger than what expected from baryonic particles only . in the case of the cd theory , instead , we saw that the ordinary matter density is combined with the effect induced by the defect via the @xmath74 parameter ( see [ rom0 ] ) , so that , in a sense , it gives rise to an effective matter / energy density one order of magnitude bigger than the actual one .",
    "adding the fact that one can interpret the strained state induced by the cosmic defect as being the equivalent of a non - uniform ( in time ) dark energy , we see that in facts the principle difference between @xmath0cdm and cd could not be that deep .",
    "the cd theory already proved to correspond to vector theories developed with different motivations and within a different scenario @xcite .",
    "the real difference between the theories , not considering the details , is in the end in the fact that cd tries to give an `` explanation '' for the dark energy , that seems to permeate the universe , within a consistent paradigm , which is the one of the defected continuum with its properties .",
    "of course this test of the cd theory is limited to the snia data and consequently to a limited range of @xmath5 values , and the poor result obtained for the age of the universe seems to indicate an inadequacy of the theory at high redshift values , where probably a better treatment of the matter content is in order .",
    "the result with the type ia supernovae is however encouraging .",
