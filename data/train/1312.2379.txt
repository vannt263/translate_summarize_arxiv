    "low - mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are among the brightest sources of the x  ray sky .",
    "they are binary systems composed by a compact object  a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh )  and a late - type companion star with mass @xmath2 .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the x  ray emission in lmxbs is the accretion of matter onto the compact object , which occurs through roche lobe overflow : the companion star , filling its own roche lobe , transfers gas to the roche lobe of the compact object , forming an accretion disc ( frank , king & raine 2002 ) .",
    "some x  ray binaries are persistent , with a constant luminosity of @xmath3@xmath4 in the x  ray band .",
    "others are instead transient ( low - mass x  ray transients , lmxts ) , namely , they alternate periods of low luminosity ( quiescence ) , to periods of high luminosity ( outbursts ) . the former lasting years and with x  ray luminosities of order @xmath5@xmath6 , the latter lasting weeks or months and with peak luminosities comparable to the ones of the persistent sources . the currently accepted model to explain the transient behaviour is the thermal - viscous disc instability model ( lasota 2001 ) , according to which the disc oscillates between a cold neutral state ( i.e. quiescence ) and a hot ionised state ( i.e. outburst ) .",
    "matter builds up in the disc during quiescence and is then transferred to the compact object during outburst .",
    "observationally , quiescent x  ray spectra of lmxts hosting a ns ( ns - lmxts ) usually consist of a soft thermal component below @xmath12 kev and a hard component above @xmath12 kev ( campana et al .",
    "1998 ; rutledge et al . 1999 ; campana 2004 ) .",
    "the soft component is well described by pure hydrogen atmosphere models ( e.g. zavlin , pavlov & shibanov 1996 ; heinke et al . 2006 ) and it is usually interpreted as thermal emission from the ns surface in the cooling phase following an outburst . according to the deep crustal heating model ( brown , bildsten & rutledge 1998 ; colpi et al .",
    "2001 ) , matter accreted in outburst compresses the innermost regions of the crust , thus triggering nuclear reactions and heating the core . the heat released is then radiated thermally in the subsequent quiescent phase .",
    "emission from crustal cooling should decrease monotonically with time on time - scales of years , while emission due to core cooling is expected to be much more stable in time . moreover , if residual accretion onto the ns is occuring in quiescence , a thermal like x  ray spectrum should be produced , due to the heating of the surface ( zampieri et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the hard component is well represented by a power law tail with a photon index @xmath7 , but its physical nature remains still debated . among the suggested explanations , accretion onto the magnetospheric boundary seems to be an intriguing possibility .",
    "although the physics of the disc - magnetosphere interaction is not well understood at low accretion rates ( i.e. in the propeller regime ) , it is generally accepted that the disc is truncated near the compact object , where the magnetic field is more intense .",
    "the standard paradigm for the propeller regime ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) predicts that accreting matter might be pushed outward by the centrigugal drag exerted by the rotating magnetosphere .",
    "however , recent studies demonstrate that if the magnetospheric radius is not far away from the corotation radius , the disc - magnetosphere interaction will not supply enough energy to expel matter from the disc and matter will instead accrete onto the magnetosphere ( `` dead disc solution '' ; dangelo & spruit 2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "accumulation of matter at the magnetospheric boundary can give rise to an inward pressure that might push the magnetospheric radius inside the corotation radius , thus allowing matter to bypass the centrifugal barrier and accrete onto the neutron star surface .",
    "furthermore , the interaction between the disc and the magnetic field in the propeller regime can lead to the formation of a hot , comptonising corona in the inner disc , which results in a spectrum with a power law shape .    for lower accretion rates , the ns can activate as a radio pulsar and the interaction between matter flowing from the companion and the relativistic wind from the pulsar can cause a shock emission . a power law like spectrum extending from the optical to the x  ray band",
    "is predicted ( tavani & arons 1997 ) .",
    "recently , the system psr j1824@xmath82452i in the globular cluster m28 was found to swing between being a radio millisecond pulsar and an accreting x  ray pulsar and viceversa , suggesting that these phases can alternate over a time - scale of a few weeks ( papitto et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "it is not well known if , and how , the soft and hard spectral components are related . in the last 15 years ,",
    "variability in the quiescent emission of several ns - lmxts has been observed on various time - scales ( from hundreds of seconds up to years ) and different physical mechanisms have been proposed in order to describe this variability ( e.g. campana et al .",

    "all these episodes have been interpreted in terms of episodic low - level accretion activity during quiescence .",
    "this may be the case also for aql x-1 .",
    "a relatively steep power law is required when fitting the spectra and the temperature is well constrained only for the first flare .",
    "this is quite similar to what has been found for the flare of sax j1750.8 - 2900 ( wijnands & degenaar 2013 ) .",
    "its spectrum is best described by an absorbed power law model ( @xmath53 for 8 d.o.f . ) with a relatively high photon index despite a large error ( @xmath54 ) . when a thermal component is added to this model , a good fit",
    "is obtained but the low statistical quality of the data do not allow to put meaningful constraints on this component .    based on our data set , the two - component spectral model which best describes the overall quiescent x  ray variability of aql x-1 is the one where the power law normalisation is the only parameter allowed to vary between the observations ( @xmath55 for 175 d.o.f . ; the f - test shows that no model with two or more variable parameters is statistically better ) .",
    "this model suggests that the quiescent x  ray emission of aql x-1 is set by a soft thermal component that is stable over time - scales of months and by a variable power law tail at higher energies .",
    "the cooling of the neutron star core might be the dominant emission source of the thermal emission and different mechanisms involving mass accretion onto the neutron star surface or magnetosphere might be responsible for the variability of the hard component .",
    "in fact , the pulsar scenario is disfavoured in justifying the overall variability , since it can hardly be reconciled with the large and rapid variations of the power law normalisation observed during the flares , @xmath12 orders of magnitudes in a few weeks ( see campana & stella 2003 ) .",
    "we note however that we can not rule out from our analysis that the thermal component can be varying as well , since also this model gives a statistically acceptable result ( @xmath56 for 159 d.o.f . ) .",
    "cackett et al .",
    "( 2011 ) analysed 14 archival observations of aql x-1 in quiescence .",
    "these observations were performed with different satellites ( 11 with _",
    "chandra _ and 3 with _ xmm - newton _ ) between november 2000 and october 2002 , and aql x-1 went in outburst twice during those years ( campana et al .",
    "the authors found variability between the observations and fit all the spectra simultaneously with the same two - component model in order to determine which spectral parameters varied . allowing the power law normalisation alone to vary",
    "gives a good fit ( @xmath57 for 533 d.o.f . ) , as well as allowing both this parameter and the neutron star effective temperature to vary gives acceptable results ( @xmath58 for 520 d.o.f . ) .",
    "therefore , the authors were unable to conclusively determine whether the power law and/or the thermal component was driving the variability ( see also rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ; campana & stella 2003 ) .    quiescent variability of cen x-4 has been revealed with _ swift _ on time - scale of days between june and august 2012 ( bernardini et al .",
    ". a total of 60 spectra were grouped according to their count rate in three ranges and then summed . the same two - component model was used to fit the three spectra .",
    "spectral changes can not be accounted for neither by a change in the column density alone ( @xmath59 for 193 d.o.f . ) , nor by changes in the column density plus the power law component ( @xmath60 for 191 d.o.f . ) or the thermal component ( @xmath61 for 193 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the best model is instead the one where both the power law and the neutron star effective temperature are free to vary ( @xmath62 for 189 d.o.f . ) .",
    "moreover , the x  ray spectral shape remained approximately constant independently of flux variations , implying that both the soft and hard components varied in tandem with the x  ray flux . to explain the close link between the two spectral components , it was suggested that the quiescent x  ray emission of cen x-4 is produced by accretion onto the ns surface . interestingly , this link has been observed also on time - scales of years ( cackett et al .",
    "2010 ) .    unlike cen x-4",
    ", a tight connection between the two spectral components is not observed in aql x-1 , neither on time - scales of weeks ( the variability can be accounted for by changes of the power law alone ) , nor of years ( cackett et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this possibly different behaviour may lie in the intrinsically different nature of these two sources .",
    "in fact , only two outbursts have been detected from cen x-4 since its discovery in 1969 , with the last one occurring @xmath63 yr ago ( kaluzienski , holt & swank 1980 ) .",
    "on the other hand , aql x-1 is the most prolific ns - lmxt , showing outbursts with a recurrence time of @xmath64 d at @xmath65 level in the last @xmath66 yr ( campana et al .",
    "moreover , no exact determinations of the spin period of cen x-4 exist and thus , assuming that the magnetic field corotates with the neutron star , no accurate predictions about the effects of the magnetospheric centrifugal drag on the accreting matter can be formulated for this source .",
    "one can speculate that different spin periods may imply a different dynamics of mass accretion .",
    "more frequent observations of the quiescence of aql x-1 with active x - ray observatories ( _ swift _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ ) may help to cast new light on its strong x  ray variability on shorter time - scales .",
