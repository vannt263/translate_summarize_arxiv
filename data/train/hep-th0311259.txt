    "when @xmath0 is odd , the corresponding lagrangian is given by the euler - chern - simons form ( * cs * ) for the ads group , whose exterior derivative is proportional to the euler density in @xmath5 dimensions @xcite . for @xmath0",
    "even , the lagrangian reads as the born - infeld form ( * bi * ) . in this case",
    "the expression for the ( * ll * ) action is proportional to the pfaffian of the @xmath6-form @xmath7 and , in this sense , it has a born - infeld - like form @xcite .",
    "these two cases are exceptional , because they are the only ones which allow sectors with non - trivial torsion @xcite",
    ". for @xmath8 there exist other interesting possibilities , which are different from * eh * , * bi * and * cs*. for example , the theory with @xmath9 has been studied by several authors in different scenarios @xcite .",
    "in this * ll * theories for any dimensions and @xmath10 , there exist well - behaved black hole solutions .",
    "however , we must differentiate between cases with odd and even @xmath10 , because in theories with even @xmath10 an , additional solution appears , which represents a naked singularity .",
    "it is interesting to study the black holes formations through gravitational collapses of thin shells . in the usual thin shell treatment @xcite",
    ", the analysis of collapse is based on the discontinuities of the extrinsic curvature of the world tube of the collapsing matter .",
    "however , the implementation of the israel formalism in this kind of theories ( * ll * ) is very difficult , because the action contains high powers in the curvature and , therefore , in the extrinsic curvature . in this formalism",
    "the complicated analysis of collapse makes the treatment quite unattractive .",
    "another approach in studying matter collapses is the oppenheimer - snyder formalism , which was applied by ilha et al @xcite to the case of a homogeneous collapsing dust , where the inner metric is described by the friedmann - robertson - walker line element , and the external metric corresponds to the solution of the fields equations in * bi * or * cs * theories . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors discussed the formation of a naked singulary in the * cs * theory .    on the other hand , an alternative way to study gravitational collapse of thin shell is the hamiltonian treatment .",
    "this treatment was applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to the einstein - hilbert gravity , where the direct integration of the canonical constraints reproduces the standard shell dynamics for a number of known cases .",
    "in particular , it was applied in detail to three dimensional spacetime and the properties of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional charged black hole collapse was further elucidated .",
    "the hamiltonian treatement was also extended to deal with rotating solutions in three dimensions .",
    "the general form of the equations of the shell dynamics implies the stability of black holes .",
    "as far as , black hole in this model can not be converted into naked singularities by any shell collapse processes .    in this work",
    "we will extend the hamiltonian formalism to our approach to the theory of * ll * in high dimensions , and particularly to the theories described in ref .",
    "this formalism permits us to analyze the black holes formations in an economical way .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii briefly reviews the * ll * action and its spherically symmetric solution .",
    "section iii analyzes the collapse of a spherically symmetric shell under the hamiltonian formalism .",

    ", the action ( [ s1 ] ) is regarded as a functional of the vielbein and the spin connection , and the corresponding field equations obtained varying with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath17 reads @xmath18 } \\left ( d-2p\\right ) \\alpha _ { p}\\epsilon _ { ab_{1} ... b_{d-1}}r^{b_{1}b_{2}} ... r^{b_{2p-1}b_{2p}}e^{b_{2p+1}} ... e^{b_{d-1}}=0% \\text { , }   \\label{sh1}\\ ] ]    @xmath18 } p\\left ( d-2p\\right ) \\alpha _ { p}\\epsilon _ { abc_{3} ... c_{d}}r^{c_{3}c_{4}} ... r^{c_{2p-1}c_{2p}}t^{c_{2p+1}}e^{c_{2p+2}} ... e^{c_{d}}=0% \\text{. }   \\label{sh2}\\ ] ]    here @xmath19 is the torsion 2-form .    note that in even dimensions , the term @xmath20 is the euler density and , therefore , does not contribute to the field equations .",
    "however , the presence of this term in the action with a fixed weight factor guarantees the existence of a well - defined variational principle for asymptotically locally ads spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the first two terms in the * ll * action ( [ s1 ] ) are the cosmological and kinetic terms of the * eh * action .",
    "therefore , general relativity is contained in the * ll * theory as a particular case .    the linearized approximation of the * ll * and * eh * actions around a flat , torsionless background are classically equivalent @xcite .",
    "however , beyond the perturbation theory the presence of higher powers of curvature in the lagrangian make both theories radically different . in particular , black holes and big - bang solutions of ( [ sh1 ] ) have different asymptotic behaviors from their * eh * counterparts .",
    "hence , a generic solution of the * ll * action can not be approximated by a solution of einstein s theory .      consider static and spherically symmetric solutions of equations ( [ sh1 ] ) and ( [ sh2 ] ) . in schwarzschild - like",
    "coordinates , the metric can be written as    @xmath21    replacing this ansatz in the field equations ( [ sh1 ] ) and ( [ sh2 ] ) leads to the following equations for @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite . however",
    ", for static and spherically symmetric configurations the equation ( [ sh2 ] ) implies that the torsion must vanish in these cases as well . ]    @xmath24    integrating equations ( [ ninf ] ) and ( [ sh3 ] ) yields    @xmath25    where the constant of integration @xmath26 relates the coordinate time to the proper time of an observer at spatial infinity .",

    "the constant @xmath27 stands for the mass up to an additive constant @xmath28 , which is nonzero only in the case of * cs * theories @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ she1 ] ) corresponds to the solution of field equations , which is a polynomial in @xmath23 , so many roots for @xmath23 with the same mass will exist , but , with different asymptotical behavior .",
    "this means that ( [ sh1 ] ) possesses , in general , several solutions with a constant curvature in the asymptotical region , making the value of the cosmological constant ambiguous .",
    "in fact , the cosmological constant could change in different regions of the same spatial section , or it could jump arbitrarily as the system evolves in time @xcite .",
    "these problems are overcome by demanding that the theory have a unique cosmological constant @xcite . in order to satisfy this condition ,",
    "we choose the coefficients @xmath15 s as follows :    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    with this choice , @xmath23 adopts the following form :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 . for even @xmath10 ,",
