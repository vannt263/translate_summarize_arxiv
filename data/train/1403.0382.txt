    "an opto - electronic device provides a different platform of electron transport , namely photon - assisted transport ( pat)@xcite . in the pat , the energy levels of an electronic system have to match to photon frequency of a radiation source to control the electron motion .",
    "therefore , the photon emission and the photon absorption processes play an essential role to enhance electron transport.@xcite for that purpose , an electrostatic potential produced by a plunger - gate is applied to the electronic system to shift it s energy levels in and out of resonance . the plunger - gate is widely used to control charge current @xcite , thermal current @xcite , photo - current @xcite and spin - dependent current @xcite for various quantized systems coupled to photon radiation .",
    "the pat controlled by plunger - gate has been investigated to study electrical @xcite and optical @xcite properties of a double - quantum dot ( dqd ) system , in which the pat can be used as a spectroscopic tool in two different regimes defined by a zero @xcite , and non - zero @xcite bias voltage . at zero - bias voltage ,",

    ", both regimes have been realized experimentally in a dqd system at low temperature.@xcite    the most important application of a dqd system in the quantum regime is intended for information storage in a quantum state,@xcite quantum - bits for quantum computing , @xcite and quantum information processing in two - state system.@xcite recent experimental work has focused on using the two lowest energy states contributing to tunneling processes in a dqd working as a two state system : the ground state resonance , and a photon - induced excited state resonance .",
    "they observed multiphoton absorption processes up to the four - order contributing to the electron transport.@xcite    based on the above - mentioned considerations , we analyze pat in serial double quantum dots embedded in a quantum wire .",
    "the dqd system is connected to two leads and coupled to a photon cavity with linearly polarized photons in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-directions , where the transport along the quantum wire is in the @xmath0-direction . a quantum master equation ( qme ) formalism is utilized to investigate transient transport of electrons controlled by the plunger - gate in the system without and with a single - photon mode .",
    "@xcite generally , there are two types of qme when characterized according to memory effects , energy - dependent coupling , and the system - leads coupling strength : the markovian and the non - markovian qme . in the case of the markovian approximation ,",
    "the system - leads coupling is assumed weak and independent of energy , memory effect are ignored and most commonly a steady state is sought .",
    "@xcite in the non - markovian approach , the system is energetically coupled to the leads including memory effect in the system .",

    "in which the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be represented in terms of the ground state and the first - excited state .",
    "we will show how the single - photon mode affects the electron transport through both states when located in the bias window and demonstrate the role of photon activated states in the transient current .",
    "the double serial quantum dot is essential here : the two lowest single - electron states of the dot molecule have very different symmetry .",
    "the ground state has a symmetric wavefunction , but the excited state has an antisymmetric one .",
    "the conduction through the ground state is thus higher than through the excited one .",
    "the `` inter - dot tunneling '' can be influenced by a photon mode polarized in the transport direction , thus strongly modifying the conduction through the photon replicas of the states in a photon cavity .",
    "the nontrivial details of this picture will be analyzed in this paper reminding us that the effects rely on the geometry of the system and states beyond the ground state and the first excited one .",
