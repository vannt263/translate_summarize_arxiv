    "the xy model has been widely used in description of many physical systems and in the studies of phase transitions and other related problems .",
    "the two dimensional xy model is especially interested in the studies of the kt transition .",
    "the model has been extensively studied in the past decades with many different methods , while the density of states(dos ) is yet not determined because of the complexity of the model .",
    "r. toral and his group computed the dos of one dimensional xy model and got some scaling results .",
    "however , the two dimensional xy model is more interesting and valuable .",
    "it is famous for its quasi - long range order , vortex pairs and kt phase transition @xcite",
    ". it will be helpful for people to understand the nature of the model and study in more details of the kt phase transition if the dos of the two dimensional xy model is calculated .",
    "the model can be described by the hamiltonian : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the coupling constant , and @xmath5 is a unit vector(the spin ) in a plane . here",
    "@xmath6 or @xmath7 is the lattice site on a plane , and the summation is over all nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "different from the ising model , the xy model is a continuous model in which the energy changes continuously .",
    "thus the total number of states of the whole system is infinite , this property gives rise to the difficulties in determining the dos near the highest and lowest energy level , as we will explain in detail later .",
    "recently many kinds of simulation algorithms used in the calculation of the dos have been proposed , in this study we use wang - landau algorithm to calculate the dos of a two dimensional xy model .",
    "the fast convergence , stability and easy to implement of the method makes it the first choice in a dos calculation , however , it has some shortcomings in the accuracy of calculation as pointed out by many researchers@xcite . in the case of the two dimensional xy model and other continuous models alike ,",
    "the algorithm usually fails to give good results of dos close the the boundaries of the spectrum .",
    "fortunately , on the spectrum boundaries , there are usually analytical results of the dos available or may be obtained in less effort . by combining the analytical results close to spectrum boundaries with simulation ,",
    "better results of the dos can be obtained . in the following",
    "we show this process using the two dimensional xy model .",
    "in order to use the wang - landau algorithm to a continuous model , we divide the whole energy range to some sub - intervals and fine divide each sub - interval into many small intervals .",
    "every small interval is regarded as an energy level and represented by its middle energy .",
    "then the wang - landau algorithm can be used to calculate the relative dos of each sub - intervals and then the dos of the whole range can be obtained by smooth join the dos on each sub - intervals .",
    "it should be noted that the dos calculated this way is the relative dos of the system , which contains an arbitrary scaling constant . in the case of a discrete model like the ising model , both of the total number of states and the number of the states of the lowest energy level are known and the scaling factor can easily be determined by using either of the known conditions . in the case of a continuous model ,",
    "one has no knowledge of the dos at any point so that it is harder to get the scaling factor directly .",
    "in fact , the situation is even worse . in the xy model ,",
    "the dos in the middle range of the spectrum do not change much so that the discretization will not introduce much error to the calculation of dos . on the other hand ,",
    "the changes of the dos close to the spectrum boundary are very large , so accuracy calculation of the dos close to the spectrum boundary is impossible by simply divide the small intervals finer and finer .",
    "this difficulty is bypassed by the observation that in many cases of the continuous models the analytical expression of dos close to the spectrum boundaries are known . in this case",
    "we can use the known expression for the dos close to the the spectrum boundaries and join them smoothly to the simulated relative dos on the middle to get the dos of the system .",
    "the hamiltonian of a two dimensional square lattice xy model can be written as :    @xmath8    here we set @xmath9 for simplicity , and @xmath10 is the angel between @xmath11 and a reference direction in the plane .",
    "the ground state of the model is the ferromagnetic ordered state where all @xmath12 are parallel .",
    "close to the ground state , each spin may deviate from the alignment direction by thermal agitation .",
    "the deviation is small at low temperature , so that it can be approximated as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total number of the square lattice sites @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the wave vector in the plane , @xmath17 is the fourier component of @xmath10 and @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the base vector of the squre lattice .",
    "the partition function of the system is @xmath20 where @xmath21 . from equation ( [ pf1 ] ) we see that @xmath22 is the laplace transformation of @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the inverse of temperature ( we use a unit system where boltzmann constant @xmath25 ) . from equation ( [ pf1 ] ) it is clear that the dos @xmath26 can be obtained if the partition function @xmath27 is known .",
    "in fact the partition function @xmath27 for the hamiltonian ( [ ham3 ] ) can be calculated directly : @xmath28 then the dos @xmath26 is obtained from the inverse laplace transformation of @xmath22 : @xmath29 finally we have : @xmath30 @xmath31 this expression of dos is the result from the low temperature approximation of partition function , which is valid only in the vicinity of the ground state .",
    "the dos of this model is symmetrical , so the dos close to the higher boundary has similar expression . as was pointed out before , wang - landau algorithm only calculates the relative value of the density of states .",
    "the constant @xmath32 is of special use in normalization , which is quite valuable in calculating the free energy and the entropy .",
    "( [ dos ] ) solves the problem of strong variations of dos close to the boundary , and at the same time , eq .",
    "( [ const ] ) solves the problem of normalization .",
    "both are intractable problems when dealing with continuous systems , and we solve them by the theoretical derivation . this is a very general method to obtain dos of a continuous system close to the ground state .    with the above mentioned method , we simulated the relative dos for each enlarged sub - intervals of the middle part , and evaluated the dos close to the spectrum boundaries by the analytic expressions . since each sub - interval",
    "is enlarged a little bit so that there is a overlap region at each join part , this overlap can help to get a smooth connect with high accuracy .",
    "we also take consideration of the trick of shulz et al@xcite in the accurate calculation of the dos on the interval boundaries . the final result of dos",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the calculation are performed with finite systems of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and periodical boundary condition were used in the simulation .",
    "the dos shows the generic behavior : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an intensive function .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the scaling law in ref .. it should be noted that this scaling relation is strictly satisfied only in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the small deviations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 to @xmath41 with respect to @xmath42 . from the figure we see that the difference between the case of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is much smaller than the difference between the case of @xmath45 and @xmath44 . based on this result",
    "we expect that the case of @xmath2 is a very good approximation to the infinite system , and the dos calculated with @xmath44 should be good enough in most applications .",
    "however , in the case a phase transition is occurred the finite size effect may be important and the @xmath44 lattice may be too small to obtain accurate results as in the case of kt transition .      with the accurate result of the dos obtained , some thermodynamic quantities can be calculated from it by a simple integration .",
    "the internal energy , the specific heat , the free energy and entropy can be immediately calculated according to the equations as follows : @xmath46 from the expression we see that the partition function can not be obtained without the knowledge of the normalization constant @xmath32 , and neither of the free energy and the entropy .",
    "when the temperature @xmath47 we may use eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) to get the analytic expressions of thermodynamic quantities at low temperature : @xmath48 - 2n-{\\frac{n-1}{2}}t\\ln t \\\\",

    "we get the ground state behavior : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the behavior of the entropy does not follow the third law of thermodynamics , which requires that the entropy is zero in the limit .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is the ignorance of the quantum effect of our calculation , in fact , in real physical systems the zero temperature behavior of the system is always quantum .",
    "mathematically the incorrect zero temperature limit of entropy comes from the finite and continuous density of states close to the ground state .",
    "the zero temperature entropy is given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "for xy model , the density of states is continuous so that the number of states at any specific point of energy is zero , thus @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the results of the thermodynamical quantities in a large temperature range was evaluated by numerical integration and are shown in fig .",
    "the figures plot the quantities per site for different sizes of the system , and it is clear from the figures that the results of different sizes of the lattices basically follow the same curve , which indicates that the size effect is not quite important for system size larger than @xmath45 , the smallest system we calculated .    as we only consider short range interaction ,",
    "this result is consistent with ref .. the peak of the specific heat differs with the size of the system . in the temperature near @xmath58 , the entropy shows a sudden rise , which indicates the rise of the number of microscopic configurations .",
    "we know in the temperature of kt transition the vortex pairs break up and the restrict is released@xcite , which also gives a rise to the number of microscopic configurations . so the abnormal behavior of the entropy curve may probably show the kt transition . as kt transition is very weak ,",
    "it can hardly be observed from the free energy curve . it is known that the effective vortex pair interaction is long ranged so that our current system size is too small to describe the kt transition properly .",
    "thus the accurate transition temperature is yet not determined by this method .",
    "we calculated the dos of two dimensional xy model on a square lattice by using the wang - landau algorithm combined with analytical expressions on the spectrum boundaries . and from the dos we calculated the internal energy , the specific heat , the free energy and the entropy . from the curve of entropy",
    "we see some symptoms of phase transition .",
    "we find that simulation algorithms will meet difficulties in the calculation of dos close to the spectrum boundaries with continuous models .",
    "we propose a general method to solve such difficulty by using the analytical expressions at the boundaries .",
