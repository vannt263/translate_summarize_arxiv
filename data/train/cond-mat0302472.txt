    "it depends also on the hydrophobicity of the chain and conformational properties will have to be taken into account .    in order to ascertain that the observed deviation from the classical hydrophilic polyelectrolyte behaviour was not due to some artifacts of the saxs technique  @xcite , we have also measured @xmath0 by afm . following the pioneering work of milling with fully charged pss  @xcite",

    "first there is clearly no dependence on @xmath3 as expected for semi - dilute solutions of overlapping chains . however there is a strong influence of @xmath2 even though these polymers are highly charged strong polyelectrolytes with @xmath2 above the onset of manning - oosawa condensation ( @xmath41 ) . in the case of hydrophilic polyelectrolytes",
    "we should expect @xmath42 for all @xmath2 .",

    "when @xmath2 decreases , the linear density of hydrophobic moieties along the chain ( styrene monomer ) increases and the intrinsic hydrophobicity of the backbone is enhanced .",
    "the consequence is a progressive deviation towards @xmath45 at the lowest @xmath2 ( @xmath46 ) . having a @xmath1 exponent different from 1/2 is highly unusual for polyelectrolyte and this clearly results from hydrophobic effects . in the framework of the pearl - necklace model two limit behaviours",
