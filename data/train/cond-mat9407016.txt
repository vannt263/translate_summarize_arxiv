    "a large amount of works dedicated to high-@xmath6 superconductors agree that an appropriate electronic model which contains all essential orbitals is the three - band hubbard model @xcite .",
    "some other works developing a multiband approach @xcite also support this belief .",
    "it is also widely accepted that the low - energy physics of insulating compounds can be described by the heisenberg hamiltonian . according to the earlier work by zhang and",
    "rice @xcite and latter studies @xcite-@xcite lightly doped systems are described by the simple t - j model .",
    "different techniques provide different exactness of the three - band model to t - j model mapping and generate a wide type of generalizations @xcite .    in our previous works",
    "@xcite a consistent low - energy reduction of the three - band model to the generalized t - j model in the realistic range of parameters has been performed .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the second - order corrections to the local energy of the carrier and its hopping integral are small ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the role of the next - nearest - neighbor terms has also been discussed .",
    "it is commonly believed that the 90% or even higher accuracy of the t - j model as the low - energy electronic model for high-@xmath6 superconductors justifies its wider study @xcite and remains this model the main pretender in describing of the superconductivity in cuprates @xcite .",
    "recent angle - resolved photoemission experiments @xcite can be interpreted as a direct support of some t - j model properties @xcite .",
    "some other anomalous behaviors of systems in normal state as well as superconductivity itself seem to be described in the framework of the t - j model @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the reasonable question from this point of view is : what is the role of either the three - band or more complex first - principles models ?",
    "there are several answers : ( i ) calculating parameters for the t - j model for real systems ; ( ii ) giving insight into the experiments including not only the simple t - j model degrees of freedom .    in this paper",
    "we mainly address the question of the t - j model parameters .",
    "superexchange constant @xmath1 for the t - j model is directly measured @xcite .",
    "hence , the parameter to be determined is the effective nearest - neighbor hopping integral .",
    "the problem of its calculation is not connected with the accuracy of low - energy mapping from the three - band model , which is always very high , but results from uncertainty in the three - band model parameters .",
    "the three - band model in conventional formulation contains as inner parameters two on - site and one inter - site coulomb repulsions , two hopping integrals , and split of the levels @xcite which are not directly measurable .",
    "some of them are fairly bad determined .",
    "this makes the calculation of the hopping integral for real systems questionable and even controversial .",
    "we develop an obvious idea of fixing the three - band model parameters by using experimental data .",
    "this idea has already been exploited in the cluster calculations for spectroscopic data @xcite and for the superexchange @xmath1 in our previous work @xcite .",
    "now , on the basis of better understanding of the low - energy model of the electronic system and magnetic polaron nature of the t - j model carriers @xcite , we calculate quite accurately the charge - transfer gap .",
    "selfconsistent calculation provides a narrow range of possible values of @xmath3 .",
    "also , an excitonic feature of the charge - transfer spectrum is obtained in agreement with resent experiments @xcite .",

    ". the technical aspects of work are given in appendix .",
    "previously , it was suggested that the three - band hubbard model is an appropriate starting point for describing the electronic structure of cuo@xmath0 planes @xcite . the cu @xmath9 orbital and @xmath10 orbitals",
    "are strongly hybridizated .",
    "these orbitals are explicitly treated in the three - band model with the justifiable assumption that other orbitals does not directly participate in the low - energy dynamics .",
    "the full hamiltonian of the model is defined by @xcite @xmath11 in standard notation of holes at o(@xmath12 ) and cu(@xmath13 ) sites .",
    "the sign convention for oxygen orbitals in @xmath14 @xcite is accepted .",
    "our approach to description of low - energy properties of the above model @xcite is based on taking into account the main coulomb ( @xmath15 ) interaction exactly and the others as perturbations .    in order to justificate this method",
    "we briefly describe here the magnitudes of the three - band model s parameters .",
    "different experimental @xcite , atomic @xcite , and band calculations @xcite show that : @xmath16 ev @xcite , @xmath17 ev @xcite , @xmath18 ev @xcite , @xmath19 ev .",
    "@xmath20 is always less than @xmath15 .",
    "there is a general agreement for the cu - o system that @xmath21 is always @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it reflects the facts that the first hole in the unit cell is predominantly at the cu site and the added hole has an oxygen s character .",
    "@xmath24 ev ( and it is unlikely that it is less than @xmath25 ev ) , @xmath26 ev @xcite .",
    "this set of magnitudes will be called hereafter the _ realistic region _ of parameters .",
    "the consistent low - energy reduction of the three - band model to the generalized t - j model has been performed in previous works @xcite .",
    "our method of the low - energy reduction has been based on construction of a set of local states with different number of holes over the filled atomic orbitals .",
    "the most essential states are :    1 .",
    "the vacuum state or the vacancy which is simply latexmath:[\\[\\label{2 }    2 .",
    "the one - hole states which represent the ground state of cuo@xmath0 plane @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the copper and symmetrical oxygen hole states with spin projection @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the two - hole states which are the zhang - rice singlets : @xmath31    the coefficients @xmath32 are functions of the parameters of the three - band model @xcite . at half filling hamiltonian ( [ 1],[1a ] ) is reduced to the heisenberg hamiltonian with spin-@xmath33 which are antiferromagnetically ordered due to the second - order virtual transitions through the set of two - hole states .",
    "note , that the above named spins-@xmath33 are exactly states @xmath34 ( eq .  ( [ 2a ] ) ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for the case near to half filling the hamiltonian of the three - band model is reduced to the hamiltonian of the t - j like model of singlets , vacancies and spins : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the hubbard operators at the site @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the local energies of the vacancy and singlet ; @xmath41 is the chemical potential ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the hopping integrals for the vacancy and singlet ( electron and hole ) , respectively ; @xmath1 is the exchange constant . all five parameters @xmath44 and @xmath1",
    "are functions of the three - band model parameters .",
    "it has been shown that relative magnitudes of the omitted terms in the hamiltonian @xmath45 ( eq.([3 ] ) ) are of the order of ten percent @xcite .",
    "we believe that the hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) describes many important properties of the cuprates .",
    "therefore , the real values of its parameters are of great interest . as was noted above , the parameters of the primary model ( [ 1],[1a ] ) are known with low precision . in this situation calculation of the observable quantities",
    "is an urgent issue since it provides a way to fix parameters of hamiltonians ( [ 1],[1a ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the best - defined experimental values which we can describe quite accurately are the superexchange constant @xmath1 and the charge - transfer gap @xmath2 .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath1 are @xmath46 ev and @xmath47 ev for the lantan and yttrium systems , respectively @xcite .",
    "these values of @xmath1 follow from measurement of the velocity of sound for magnons .",
    "the value of the charge - transfer gap is known from a variety of optical measurements @xcite and is near to @xmath48 ev . observation of photoconductivity at the same energies shows that the excitations result in separated electrons and holes @xcite .",

    "( [ 4 ] ) represents the exchange energy between two holes ( spins ) due to the repulsion at an oxygen .",
    "this contribution has the ferromagnetic sign and arises as an exchange interaction between the hole states ( [ 2a ] ) due to their nonlocal nature .",

    "the most general expression for the charge - transfer energy is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 refers to the total number of electrons , @xmath60 is the ground state energy , @xmath61 is the minimal energy of a system with one removed and added electron . for our system eq .",

    "formula ( [ 8 ] ) is quite good up to @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the characteristic values of all essential parameters which determine the observable quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) . in the _ realistic region _ of parameters of the three - band model one can easily obtain the experimental values @xmath74 ev and @xmath75 ev for lantan and yttrium systems . the value for @xmath63 ( [ 7 ] ) was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and is equal to @xmath76 ev in the same region of parameters .",
    "the characteristic values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( [ 8 ] ) depend on ratios @xmath3 for electrons and holes .",
    "these ratios weakly differ and for a typical value of @xmath77 we have @xmath78 ev . thus , the overall gain in energy due to magnetic polaron formation is of the order of @xmath25 ev , which is comparable with the experimentally observed @xmath79 ev .",
    "therefore , the magnetopolaron effect gives essential contribution in the value of the charge - transfer gap .    in the paper",
    "@xcite it was proposed that the usual phonon polaron effect contributes in the observable values of the charge - transfer spectrum .",
    "the corresponding gain in energy was estimated as @xmath80 ev .",
    "however , we suppose that due to the frank - condon principle the usual polaronic effect does not contribute in the optical transition .",
    "magnetopolaron effect has no such restriction since it involves electronic degrees of freedom only .",
    "we will return to this question in discussions .",
    "thus , we find superexchange constant @xmath1 ( [ 4 ] ) and charge - transfer gap @xmath2 ( [ 6 ] ) ( @xcite ) as functions of the three - band model parameters : @xmath81 both observable quantities are strongly depend on hopping integrals and @xmath82 , that provides the way of fixing these latter by the experimental values of the first .",
    "as was discussed earlier , abundance of the parameters makes questionable the calculation of the effective hopping integral for the t - j model from the three - band model for real cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "while coulomb repulsions are known with a fair precision ( @xmath83 ) , the situation is complicated due to a very low precision of the direct determination of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which mostly affect all effective parameters .",
    "previously , the above parameters have been determined from the analysis of spectroscopic data @xcite . in our recent work",
    "we fitted @xmath85 to experimental value of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "now , on the basis of a better understanding of the charge - transfer process and more accurate calculations , fixing of the worse known parameters using experimental values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 suggests itself . we will show that this procedure keeps effective @xmath43 inside a narrow enough region .",
    "firstly , for further discussion we define o - o hopping as @xmath86 . in order to characterize the above mentioned strong dependence of the parameters ( [ 9 ] )",
    "one can calculate @xmath87 at fixed @xmath1 or at fixed @xmath2 , with other parameters ( coulomb repulsions and @xmath88 ) as constants in the _",
    "realistic region_. we evaluate @xmath85 vs @xmath89 at @xmath90 mev and @xmath91 mev , @xmath92 ev and @xmath93 ev ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "note that the profiles of the curves resemble those at the diagram of @xmath94 for the simple one - band hubbard model where @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and the crossing point uniquely determines @xmath98 and @xmath8 .    to be more specific",
    ", we firstly determined @xmath85 for constant @xmath1 at an arbitrary @xmath89 and further moved up or down along the curve @xmath1 = const to fix the value of @xmath2 .",
    "we used the data for la@xmath0cuo@xmath49 @xmath99 mev @xcite and @xmath100 ev ( photoconductivity ) @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig4],[fig5],[fig6 ] show the parameter of our prime interest : the effective integral for hole in the t - j model .",
    "parameter @xmath101 is @xmath102 for figs .",
    "[ fig4],[fig5],[fig6 ] , respectively . in all figures",

    "all variations of @xmath112 actually show only weak dependence , and in the most preferential region , when all coulombs are included , @xmath43 lies between @xmath113 .",
    "we believe , that our consideration is quite accurate and well justified .",
    "hence , one can hope that the interval for @xmath3 obtained above provides the basis for _ quantitatively _ correct calculations in the framework of the t - j model .",
    "for example , for the recently proposed mechanism of superconductivity in the t - j model which provides a very @xmath3-sensitive ( exponentially ) gap value @xcite .",
    "also some other features can be achieved .",
    "figures[fig7],[fig8],[fig9 ] represent effective hopping @xmath114 for vacancy , @xmath89 and @xmath115 respectively , vs other parameters . here always @xmath116 . strong support of our fixing procedure is that selfconsistently determined @xmath89 and @xmath85 ( figs.[fig8],[fig9 ] ) lie in the most appropriate region . from our calculation @xmath117 ev , @xmath118 ev , that is really close to cluster calculation of eskes and sawatzky @xcite and to the results of other groups @xcite .",
    "the problem of consistently taking into account the coulomb interaction of the carriers in the framework of the t - j - like model remains open .",
    "several recent works are devoted to this problem @xcite .",
    "as was suggested earlier @xcite , the short - range part of this coulomb interaction may be kept by inclusion of the nearest - neighbour cu - o repulsion . since @xmath119 is included in our effective model",
    ", one can expect that some effects will be caught .    in the recent work @xcite a kink in the optical reflectivity somewhere below the charge - transfer peak ( at @xmath120 ev )",
    "was observed .",
    "since it had no associated photoconductivity , it was related to creation of exciton .",
    "an essential role of the short - range coulomb interaction was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our way of reasoning the exciton state ,",
    "if it exists , is the frenkel exciton , because of short - range nature of interactions .",
    "now it is evident that an effective attraction can result from pure magnetopolaron effect in the t - j model @xcite .",
    "as was shown in works @xcite , `` contact '' interaction of two holes ( without charge ) dressed by spin fluctuations is attractive for a special symmetry of the wave - function .",
    "however , the associated energy is very small ( @xmath121 ev ) .",
    "it is possible to combine the ideas of the short - range coulomb and magnetopolaron effects .",
    "the difference between @xmath122 ( [ 7 ] ) when hole and electron are separated and @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) ( where @xmath53 denotes the lowest singlet ) when they are close , is the effective coulomb attraction of the `` bare '' hole and electron ( singlet and vacancy ) .",
    "we write an addition to eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the electron number operator , @xmath125 is the hole number operator .",
    "we have found that @xmath126 is really almost independent from @xmath15 and @xmath20 and @xmath127 .",
    "`` bare '' electron - hole attraction itself does not mean frenkel s exciton effect .",
    "one has to show that `` dressed '' electron and hole placed closely possess the lower energy than the mobile ones . in order to specify the magnetopolaronic language",
    "we reproduce here the wave function of the magnetic polaron from the ref.@xcite . for the ising background it has the more simple form : @xmath128 where @xmath129 sublattice with the spin @xmath130 , @xmath131 primarily hole operators ; at @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "thus , ansatz consist of mixture of `` bare '' hole and holes with one overturned spin .",
    "contact interaction of these polarons with opposite spins was considered in ref.@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the gain in energy for `` attracting polarons '' arises from the pure t - j model effects @xcite and effective coulomb attraction ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the loss in energy is from restriction of the mobility .",
    "competition of these evident effects ( without coulomb interaction ) provides bound states up to @xmath135 @xcite . simply acting in a spirit of magnetic polaron interaction",
    "@xcite we obtain @xmath136 .",
    "thus , at @xmath137 ev , @xmath138 ev .",
    "more accurate variational construction of the exciton - magnetopolaron wave - function ( on the ising background ) yields @xmath139 ( at @xmath140 ) .",
    "this wave - function consists of the mixture of `` bare '' hole and electron at neighbor sites and hole and electron with overturned spins .",
    "it is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11]a .",
    "thus , at @xmath141 ev , @xmath142 ev , that is slightly less than the observed @xmath143 ev @xcite . in our calculations",
    "the interaction between next - nearest - neighbor magnetic polaron was neglected , which produced small effect for the pure t - j model @xcite but may be essential for the problem with attraction .",
    "( these configurations are shown in figs.[fig11]b , c ) .",
    "also , the answer may partly lie in the rest of the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "the detailed quantitative consideration of some of the effective parameters of the low - energy models related to description of the high - @xmath6 superconductors presented in this work relies heavily on our earlier works . in these works",
    "consistent mapping of the three - band hubbard model onto the effective t - j model ( @xcite ) has been produced .",
    "taking into account all essential interactions enables us to correctly calculate local energies of various set of states with different number of particles and matrix elements of interesting transitions .",
    "combination of properties of the local `` bare '' hole and electron ( zr - singlet and vacancy ) and their magnetic polaron nature as the carriers allows us to approach the calculation of some observable quantities adequately .",
    "we have calculated the superexchange @xmath1 and charge - transfer gap @xmath2 .",
    "their experimental values strongly constrict a possible variation interval for the quantity of great interest : the @xmath3 ratio in the t - j model .",
    "selfconsistent calculation of this ratio for a wide range of parameters places it into the region @xmath144 .",
    "narrowed ranges for the three - band model parameters have also been determined : @xmath117 ev , @xmath145 ev .",
    "they coincide quite well with earlier cluster calculations , that supports our selfconsistent procedure .",
    "an excitonic state of the frenkel type induced by the short - range coulomb interaction with the energy lower than the charge - transfer transition approximately by @xmath146 ev is found .",
    "we have also compared the width of the peak in the @xmath147 at @xmath148 ev from ref .",
    "@xcite which is of the order of @xmath149 ev with the total width of the charge - transfer spectrum .",
    "this total width is equal to the combined width of the vacancy and singlet bands . according to eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) , the width of the hole band is @xmath150 at @xmath151 and width of the electron band is @xmath152 at @xmath153 .",
    "resulting total width of the charge - transfer spectrum is about @xmath154 ev .",
    "thus , the narrowness of the @xmath155 spectrum can also be easily reproduced by magnetic polaron language .",
    "one of the essential questions for the cuo@xmath0 - planes systems , which we only briefly touched , is the phonon polaron effect . if it does not have a projection on optics , or , as we believe ,",
    "the frank - condon principle is applicable , our calculated @xmath156 ratio is the upper limit of the real parameter .",
    "this is due to mass renormalization for real carriers .",
    "there is another view on the polaron effect ( see ref .",
    "it is stated that electron - phonon interaction lies in an intermediate range and thus the frank - condon principle is not obeyed .",
    "if such is the situation , we underestimate the depth of the bands ( or overestimate @xmath2 ) , and effective @xmath43 should be increased .",
    "our estimation shows that this increasing of @xmath157 is no more than 30% .",
