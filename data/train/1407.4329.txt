    "the x - ray energy can be tuned from xuv @xcite , hard x - rays @xcite up to @xmath0 rays @xcite by adjusting the electron energy , making it a versatile tool for imaging the structure and dynamics of matter @xcite , for medical @xcite , biological @xcite and nuclear physics applications @xcite , and for exploring strong field physics @xcite .    while plane - wave electrons were used in most previous studies , new types of electron vortex beams , called twisted electrons ,",
    "can now be generated .",
    "these twisted electrons are characterized by the projection of orbital angular momentum @xmath1 onto the beam s propagation axis , which is the topological charge of the vortex .",
    "electron vortex beams were first predicted theoretically in 2007 @xcite in analogy to optical vortex beams and have been realized experimentally later on with @xmath2 and kinetic energies of several hundred kev @xcite .",
    "twisted electrons have been used to reveal information on the chiral and magnetic structure of materials @xcite , even down to the atomic scale @xcite .",
    "moreover , they feature spin - orbit - coupling @xcite and a large orbital angular momentum induced contribution to the electron magnetic moment @xcite that , e.g. , modifies polarization radiation @xcite . in addition",

    "the photons are mainly backscattered , frequency up - shifted to x - ray energies and recorded on a ccd screen downstream the beam of electrons .",
    "plane - wave laser light is assumed with an extent in the focal plane much larger than the waist of the electron beam .",
    "b ) definition of coordinates and angles that are used to characterize the propagation of electrons and photons in compton scattering . ]    in this paper , we consider the inverse compton scattering of laser light on a beam of twisted electrons .",
    "in particular , we here explore the energy- and angular distribution of the emitted x - rays and compare them with those as obtained with ordinary plane - wave electrons .",
    "this analysis is complementary to previous investigations @xcite , in which the compton scattering of twisted photons on plane - wave electrons was studied for the transfer of oam to the backscattered photons . for the present set - up with twisted electrons ,",
    "we find distinct features for the spatial and energy structure of the emitted x - rays that are not available for plane - wave electrons .",
    "we investigate the possibilities to utilize the degrees of freedom of the twisted electrons , in particular their aperture angle and topological vortex charge , to shape the spatial intensity distribution of emitted x - rays .",
    "we show that a much better control of the spatial distribution of x - rays can be achieved by using proper beams of twisted electrons , instead of plane - wave electrons , in inverse compton scattering x - ray sources .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] outlines the basic set - up for the inverse compton scattering : a relativistic beam of twisted electrons with total energy @xmath3 propagating along the @xmath4-axis collides _ head - on _ , i.e.  under @xmath5 , with optical laser light of frequency @xmath6 . for relativistic electrons , of course",
    ", the photons are dominantly backscattered and shifted towards x - ray energies , and can thus be recorded quite easily downstream the beam of electrons on a ccd screen . behind the interaction point , the electrons should be bent away from the x - ray beam by a static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect : theory ] we present the theoretical background , starting from a concise reminder of the case of plane wave electrons and then generalizing to twisted electron beams . in section [",
    "sect : results ] we present the results of our calculation , starting with the energy distribution of the scattered x - rays at fixed scattering angle and then going to the energy - integrated angular distributions .",
    "we finally discuss the scattering with superpositions of twisted electrons .",
    "in section [ sect : summary ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "before we investigate compton scattering of light on twisted electrons , let us briefly recall the usual case of compton scattering on _ plane - wave _ electrons , for which the cross section is readily derived by squaring the plane - wave s matrix @xcite @xmath7 with the scattering amplitude @xmath8 and the compton tensor @xmath9 in these formulas , @xmath10 and @xmath11 as well as @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the four - momenta and polarization vectors of the incident and scattered photons , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the four - momenta of the initial and final electrons .",
    "the @xmath16-function in eq .   ensures the conservation of the four - momenta during the scattering .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 is the fine structure constant , @xmath18 denotes the dirac matrices and @xmath19 is the electron propagator , and we use natural units with @xmath20 . note that the dirac bi - spinors @xmath21 refer to _ plane - wave _ electrons with momentum @xmath22 and helicity @xmath23 .",
    "the angle - differential cross section for the compton scattering on unpolarized plane - wave electrons is given by @xcite @xmath24 provided that the polarization of the scattered photons remains unobserved .",
    "in this expression , the sum over the squared scattering amplitude also determines the angular emission pattern , @xmath25 which depends on the polarization of the incident laser light . for a linearly - polarized laser , for example",
    ", the emission pattern has a purely dipolar shape if all the terms including the electron recoil , @xmath26 , are omitted here and in the following as is appropriate for optical laser frequencies and not too large electron energies .",
    "in addition , the frequency of the scattered photons in @xmath27 depends on the polar angle @xmath28 w.r.t .  the beam of incoming electrons , the @xmath4-axis , and is just given by the laser frequency @xmath6 as well as the lorentz factor @xmath29 of the electrons .",
    "in fact , eq .   is crucial in order to understand the properties of the generated x - rays : as seen from this expression , the laser frequency @xmath6 is doppler shifted up to the maximum frequency @xmath30 for @xmath31 ; and @xmath32 decreases rapidly as @xmath28 is increased .",
    "moreover , since the cross section is proportional to @xmath33 , most of the radiation is emitted into a narrow cone , centered around the electron momentum @xmath34 , and with an angular divergence @xmath35 .",
    "equations   all refer to the compton scattering of laser photons on plane - wave electrons which are characterized by the linear momentum @xmath34 .",
    "however , electron beams can be prepared also in twisted states , known as electron vortex beams @xcite , and characterized by the linear momentum component @xmath36 and the projection of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) onto the propagation axis @xmath37 , which is the topological charge of the vortex @xcite . for bessel beams of twisted electrons , especially ,",
    "only the absolute value of transverse momentum has a unique value @xmath38 while its direction remains undefined , and the wave function can be written as @xcite @xmath39 with the amplitudes @xmath40 as seen from eq .  , the twisted bessel beams are coherent superpositions of plane - wave states @xmath41 with momentum vectors @xmath42 that are distributed uniformly over the azimuthal angle @xmath43 and that form the surface of a cone with an aperture @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ]  b ) .      with the description of twisted electrons at hand we are ready to study compton scattering of laser light with the initial electrons in a _",
    "twisted state_. to calculate the cross section we have to square the twisted s matrix @xcite @xmath45 which is the superposition of plane - wave s matrices , eq .",
    ", with the same amplitudes @xmath46 as in . owing to the conservation of the linear momentum , the squared s matrix simplifies to @xcite @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in this expression",
    "only the absolute square of the amplitude appears , @xmath49 ^ 2 $ ] , while the dependence on the oam value @xmath1 drops out .",
    "the square of the radial delta - function can be re - written as @xmath50 ^ 2\\to \\delta(|{\\boldsymbol}p_\\perp|-\\varkappa ) \\frac{r}{\\pi}$ ] for a large but finite cylindrical normalization volume with radius @xmath51 for the twisted electron wave function . in the cross section , in fact , this factor @xmath51 cancels with the one that occurs in the normalization of the initial twisted state @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the definition of a cross section for twisted particles one has to take into account that the flux of incident particles in a twisted wave depends on the lateral position . it has been proposed to define an average cross section by averaging the plane wave flux factor @xmath52 over all plane wave components as @xmath53 @xcite . for head - on collisions",
    "as considered in the present case , the averaged flux factor coincides however with the plane wave flux factor @xmath54 .",
    "since the squared amplitude is independent of the oam value @xmath1 , the energy and angle - differential cross section for compton scattering of laser light on unpolarized _ twisted _ electrons @xmath55 only depends on the momentum cone aperture @xmath56 but not on the vortex charge @xmath1 . because the plane - wave component s momenta @xmath57 are lying on a cone surface , both the plane - wave emission pattern @xmath58 and the frequency of the scattered photons @xmath59 now depend on the electron azimuthal angle @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , @xmath60 resembles eq .  , but with the photon scattering angle @xmath28 replaced by an effective scattering angle @xmath61 : the angle between @xmath57 and the momentum @xmath62 of the scattered photon .",
    "a simple expression for the effective scattering angle @xmath61 can be obtained in the regime of small cone aperture @xmath63 and photon scattering angles @xmath64 , where ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] b ) @xmath65",
    "for compton scattering of ( plane - wave ) laser light on twisted electron beams the effective scattering angle @xmath61 depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath43 of the plane - wave components .",
    "this effective scattering angle in turn determines the frequency of the scattered photons @xmath66 according to eq .",
    "( 10 ) . since we have to integrate over @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we get a distribution of frequencies @xmath67 of the scattered photons for fixed scattering angle @xmath28 , in contrast to the case of plane - wave electrons where the frequency of the scattered photons is determined for a given angle @xmath28 , see eq .",
    "figure [ fig : energy_differential ] a ) displays the range of allowed frequencies @xmath68 as shaded area , and where the lower and upper bound of this frequency range is given by @xmath69 while the upper bound @xmath70 of the spectrum arises from the plane - wave component that is maximally aligned with the scattered photon momentum @xmath62 , i.e.  @xmath71 , with the smallest effective scattering angle @xmath72 , the lower bound @xmath73 is caused by the least aligned plane - wave component with @xmath74 and the largest effective scattering angle @xmath75 .",
    "for comparison , figure  [ fig : energy_differential ] a ) also shows the plane - wave energy angle correlation ( 5 ) as dashed curve ( pw ) . although the maximum frequency @xmath76 is equal for both plane - wave and twisted electrons , its position shifts from @xmath31 for plane - wave electrons to @xmath77 for twisted electrons , where the momentum @xmath34 of one particular plane - wave component is supposed to be collinear with @xmath62 , i.e.  @xmath78 .    to calculate the distribution of scattered frequencies",
    "we perform the integration over @xmath43 in ( 9 ) and use the identity for the @xmath16-function @xmath79 where the sum is over all zeros @xmath80 of @xmath81 .",
    "then , the energy and angle - differential cross section @xmath82 is expressed as the incoherent superposition of contributions from two particular plane - wave components with azimuthal angles @xmath83 with @xmath84 the coherence of the final state particles is hidden because we project the final states onto plane - waves with different linear momenta that do not interfere @xcite . in particular , the two plane - wave contributions in eq .",
    "have different final electron momenta @xmath85 and they are added incoherently on the level of the squared amplitudes .",
    "the plane - wave final states are a convenient choice since we study the energy and angular distributions of the scattered x - rays , which are observed by a detector that measures the photons linear momentum but not their orbital angular momentum @xcite . to access the coherence of the final states , e.g.  the orbital angular momentum of the scattered photons , one has to project the final particles onto a basis of twisted states , as was done e.g.  in @xcite .",

    "for twisted electrons , in contrast , each of the plane - wave components produces an analog pattern with the peak intensity at @xmath77 and @xmath98 .",
