    "they are also the starting point for analyzing electromagnetic meson production reaction data which have been of high precision and extensive in recent years  @xcite .",
    "there exists several approaches  @xcite to extract nucleon resonances ( @xmath9 ) from @xmath2 reaction data . in general ,",
    "almost all 4-stars nucleon resonances listed by particle data group  @xcite ( pdg ) are found in all approaches",
    ". however the existence of some @xmath9 states , in particular those in the higher mass region , is controversial .",
    "the most investigated case is the number of resonances in @xmath2 @xmath0 partial wave . in the region near roper @xmath10 , two poles close to the @xmath11 threshold were found in refs .",
    "@xcite and in our recent extraction  @xcite , while only one pole in the similar energy region was reported in refs .  @xcite . in the higher mass region , the @xmath6 in @xmath0 @xmath12 partial - wave",
    "is not reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , but is identified in all other analysis  @xcite .    to make progress , it is important to address a commonly asked question on the extent to which the extracted resonance parameters depend on the reaction models employed and the accuracy of the empirical partial - wave amplitudes used in the analysis . for @xmath0 resonances , this was investigated by cutkosky and wang  @xcite and more recently by ceci , svarc , and zauner  @xcite within the carnegie - mellon university - berkeley model  @xcite ( cmb ) . in an analysis including @xmath13 and pseudo @xmath14 channels ,",
    "it was demonstrated  @xcite that the existence of @xmath6 depends on the structure of the @xmath2 amplitude which is related to the coupled - channels effects due to @xmath15 channel . in this work ,",
    "we carry out a similar investigation within a dynamical coupled - channels model  @xcite ( ebac - dcc ) .",
    "the main difference between our approach and cmb model is to define the non - resonant amplitude by using the meson - exchange mechanisms .",
    "we thus have provided additional information for examining the dependence of the @xmath0 resonances on the reaction models employed in the analysis .",

    "first we would like to examine the stability of the two - pole structure of @xmath0 resonances near the @xmath1 threshold ( @xmath16 gev ) .",
    "our objective is to examine how this two - pole structure is sensitive to the parameters of the meson - exchange mechanisms within the ebac - dcc model used in our extraction  @xcite . in the fits",
    "@xcite ( jlms ) of @xmath2 data  @xcite , these parameters were determined within the ranges known from previous studies of meson - exchange mechanisms . here",
    "we allow them to vary much more freely such that several models with different analytic properties are obtained for examining whether the resulting pole positions are stable within the ebac - dcc model .",
    "the two - pole structure is also reported by dring _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in an analysis based on a meson - exchange model with a bare nucleon state  @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analytic structure of this model as well as other similar models  @xcite is rather different from the ebac - dcc model , in particular in the region near the nucleon pole , mainly because of the differences in deriving  @xcite three - dimensional scattering equations from relativistic quantum field theory . to further examine the stability of the two - pole structure of @xmath0 resonances and the existence of @xmath6 state within the meson - exchange models , we also perform fits by using such a model .",
    "our formulation is similar to that developed by pearce and afnan  @xcite .",
    "we will show that the positions of two poles near the @xmath1 threshold extracted from all of the meson - exchange models constructed here are rather stable .",
    "this explains why the similar two - pole structure is also found in the other analyses  @xcite which use very different reaction models .",
    "the second part of our investigation is to examine the extent to which the structure of the @xmath0 amplitude in higher invariant mass @xmath17 region can influence the two - pole structure near the @xmath11 threshold .",

    "@xcite to examine how the number of resonance states in the region near @xmath6 state listed by pdg depend on the structure of the data .",
