    "a specific example of quantum coherence phenomenon is nonlinear magneto - optical rotation ( nmor ) @xcite .",
    "the effect consists of light - intensity - dependent rotation of the polarization plane of linearly polarized light upon its propagation through a medium placed in an external magnetic field .",

    "an important breakthrough in the study of nmor was the application of frequency- @xcite and amplitude - modulated light @xcite , which resulted in the fm nmor ( frequency modulated nonlinear magneto - optical rotation ) and amor ( amplitude modulated optical rotation ) techniques .",

    "it is possible to selectively create superpositions between sublevels differing in a magnetic quantum number @xmath1 by 2 , 4 , or even more , if only the system supports such coherences @xcite .",
    "information about the system s quantum state may also be obtained from the angular momentum distribution by analyzing time - dependent rotation of the polarization plane of light measured at non - zero magnetic field .",
    "thus , in addition to selective generation and detection of the coherences , the technique constitutes a powerful tool in analyzing the evolution of a quantum state of a system .",

    "the last difference manifests in the appearance of the @xmath107 term in denominators of the formulae for the density - matrix elements , which leads to the generation of additional resonances of the density - matrix elements vs. the modulation frequency . assuming that the whole energy splitting of the ground - state zeeman sublevels is due to the magnetic field the resonance arises at non - zero magnetic field ; the time - dependent rotation of the polarization plane arises when the larmor splitting of the levels coincides with a given multiplicity of half of the modulation frequency ( @xmath108 ) . for @xmath109 and low magnetic field",

    "in the latter case , the ratio decreases with the power [ bottom right - handed inset to fig .",

    "the observed dependences reflect the different behavior of the @xmath149 coherence and the @xmath150 and @xmath151 coherences at the two transitions . among others , the behavior originates from optical pumping and population redistribution between zeeman sublevels within a given hyperfine state .",
    "since for the @xmath124 transition the maximal clebsch - gordan coefficients are those from the sublevels with maximal @xmath1 ( @xmath152 ) , these states are most efficiently depopulated .",
    "simultaneously , the depletion of the other sublevels is smaller , which effectively leads to an aligned state with the highest population in the @xmath153 sublevel and the lowest population in the @xmath154 sublevels .",
    "the change in the population distribution is reflected in the amplitudes of the zeeman coherences associated with these states . for the @xmath124 transition and intense light ,",

    "[ fig : amplituderatio ] , the simulations qualitatively reproduce the observed dependence , i.e. increase of the ratio for the @xmath124 transition and decrease for the other transition .    in alkali atoms",
    "there are two hyperfine ground states supporting long - living quantum coherences .",

    "the difference in the position of the amor resonances arises from nuclear contribution to the land factor .",
    "signals were measured at a magnetic field of about @xmath160  mg and pump- and probe - light powers of 6  @xmath125w and 3  @xmath125w , respectively . ]",
    "as shown , the two signals are significantly different ; not only different are the numbers of the amor resonances associated with the @xmath6 coherences ( there is only one @xmath6 coherence in the @xmath7 ground state ) , but also their amplitudes are distinct .",
    "the latter difference originates from the transition probabilities and less efficient hyperfine pumping at the @xmath159 transition than at the @xmath124 one .",
    "moreover , the positions of the amor resonances in a strong magnetic field are different .",
    "it results from the difference in the land factors for the two ground - state @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the electron and @xmath163 the nuclear @xmath164-factor .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : splitting ] ) it can be easily shown that although the splittings due to the electron spin are opposite and hence indistinguishable in the amor experiment , the nuclear - spin contributions are different , which leads to the separation of the resonance @xmath165 , where @xmath166 denotes the nuclear magneton . for a magnetic field of about 780  mg",
    "we predicted a splitting of about 4.35  khz which is consistent with experimentally measured value of 4.32  khz .",
    "this difference in frequencies of amor resonances for the transitions is important from a point of view of quantum - state engineering since it offers an additional way of controlling and modifying the quantum state by specific tuning of the frequency of an additional rf field @xcite .",

    "increasing power of either of the light beams results in reduction of the lifetime of a quantum state which manifest as broadening of the amor resonances ( see insets ) .",
    "the signals were measured for a magnetic field of about 780  @xmath125 g with a probe power of 1.2  @xmath125w ( a ) and pump power of 2.2  @xmath125w .",

    "the lifetimes @xmath167 were extracted from the amor resonance width as @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the amor - resonance half - width at half maximum measured vs. the modulation frequency .",
    "figure  [ fig : lifetime ] shows that raising the light power of either of the beams leads to broadening of the amor resonance ( see insets ) and shortening of the ground - state coherence lifetime . in order to calculate the coherence lifetime that is not affected by the light",
    ", we performed a series of measurements of the amor signals at different pump and probe powers and double - extrapolate the resonance width to zero light powers .",
    "the double - extrapolated lifetime of the coherences studied in this experiment is equal to 13.2(12 )  ms , which is determined by three relaxation mechanisms : collisions with the uncoated surfaces , mainly in the cell stem containing a rubidium metal droplet , spin - exchange collisions between rubidium atoms @xcite , and temperature - dependent dephasing collisions with the cell wall coating @xcite . using a simple mathematical model , the relaxation rate due to collisions with uncoated surfaces was estimated at the level of @xmath170  s@xmath171 . at the same time , the relaxation rate associated with spin - exchange collisions , that is calculated based on ref .",
    "@xcite , gives @xmath172  s@xmath171 .",
    "the other relaxation channel most likely are dephasing collisions of atoms with the coating .",
    "we have analyzed the possibility of generating the quantum superpositions of ground - state zeeman sublevels differing in the magnetic quantum numbers by 2 . since in the @xmath109 state",
    "the sublevels split nonlinearly with a magnetic field ( nonlinear zeeman effect ) , selective generation of coherences between specific sublevels by appropriate tuning of the modulation frequency is possible . in particular , it was shown that for the magnetic fields such that nonlinear magnetic - sublevel splitting exceeds the ground - state relaxation rate , selective addressing of the @xmath150 , @xmath149 , and @xmath151 coherences is possible .",
    "efficiency of the coherence generation versus different experimental parameters , such as modulation frequency , pump- and probe - light power , light frequency was analyzed .",
    "we have shown that in our experimental setup the lifetime of the coherences exceeds 10  ms .",
    "such a long coherence lifetime opens interesting possibilities for application of the coherences in quantum - state engineering and quantum computation . in this context",
    "particularly interesting seems to be the ability of modification of atomic quantum state by application of external field , e.g. magnetic and/or rf field .",
