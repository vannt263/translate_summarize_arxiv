    "these variations can be astrophysically measured and compared to the high precision laboratory data@xcite .",
    "recent advances in computational methods and high - precision experimental techniques propelled researchers to propose different experiments as well as experimental candidates aimed at the determination of such variation in the last few decades@xcite .",
    "high precision trapped atom and molecular ion spectroscopy is one of the most promising approaches for measuring such space - time variation of the fundamental physical constants experimentally , as molecular spectroscopy is sensitive to both the dimensionless constants @xmath7 and @xmath8@xcite .",
    "these spectroscopic techniques employ a diatomic molecule as a probe for measuring such variations in fundamental physical constants following the proposal put forward by flambaum and kozlov@xcite .",
    "diatomic molecules or radical having nearly degenerate long lived rotational and vibrational levels belonging to different electronic states are particularly sensitive to measure the variation in @xmath7 and @xmath8 due to several orders of magnitude enhancement@xcite . in case of a neutral or charged diatomic molecule having unpaired electrons",
    "with ground state fine structure multiplet the transition frequency between the two multiplet states is given by , @xmath10    where @xmath5 is the magnitude of spacing between the multiplets ( spin - orbit ) , @xmath6 is the magnitude of vibrational spacing under harmonic approximation and @xmath11 is the vibrational quantum number@xcite .",
    "the fine structure interval @xmath5 holds the relation with @xmath7 as @xmath12 , where z is the nuclear charge and @xmath13 . on the other hand @xmath6",
    "is related to @xmath8 which is given by @xmath14 .",
    "therefore @xmath15 is sensitive to the variation of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 as given by the following equations , @xmath16 on the other hand the fractional variation of @xmath15 may be written as@xcite    @xmath17    where @xmath18@xcite is known as the enhancement factor or the amplification factor .",
    "according to flambaum and kozlov large value for k of a species hints at its potential candidature as an experimental probe to gauge the variation in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "ideally diatomic molecules for which @xmath19 would be the best possible probes for such purpose",
    ". however it turns out that such a possibility is purely fortuitous as no such diatomic molecules exist .",
    "this limits the search for such diatomic molecules to cases where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is substantially large .",
    "unfortunately there are very few molecules which obey this criterion .",
    "therefore it is essential to identify molecular candidates on which both experiments can be performed and astrophysical observations can be made .",
    "flambaum _ et.al . _ and others have recently proposed certain candidates as viable probes , such as cs@xmath22@xcite , mgh , cah@xmath23@xcite , cl@xmath24 , irc , hff@xmath23@xcite , nh@xmath23@xcite , sibr@xcite .",

    "although sibr is relevant but its harmonic stretching frequency falls out of the infrared spectroscopy window .",
    "it is imperative to identify new candidates as this would enrich the gamut of probes so that more systematic analysis can be conducted . in this paper",
    "we identify selenium deuteride ( sed ) as a potential candidate for experimentally probing the variation of fundamental physical constants and perform detailed theoretical study on that particular molecule to find variation in transition frequency upon a given change in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "although @xmath25 and other c - h compounds are astrophysically abundant , sed radical is yet to be observed .",
    "however , asymptotic giant branch stars are probable sites to look for sed due to the abundance of s - process isotopes and freely available deuterium in the cooler portion of the universe",
    ". the added advantage would be the cooler temperature for good ir observation which can be potentially important complementarity to the microwave observations made on @xmath25 inversion .",
    "laboratory experiment wise sed is very similar to the trapping of nh or cah molecules in magneto - optical traps@xcite and hence it may be considered as a possible candidate for fundamental test .",
    "chemically , sed is an open shell molecule with one unpaired electron @xmath26 in its @xmath27 orbital with a @xmath28 configuration .",

    "according to the hund s rule for more than half filled ( @xmath28 electronic configuration ) @xmath3 is energetically lower than @xmath4 .",

    "@xmath46 depends on the vibrational quantum number as per the following relation derived by brown and co - workers@xcite ( expanded upto the first order of @xmath40 term ) @xmath47    therefore the spin - orbit hamiltonian becomes , @xmath48    in a molecular system rotation , vibration and electronic interactions influence one another . for the ro - vibrational electronic spectra of a diatomic molecule , the different angular momenta , i.e. electron spin angular momentum ( @xmath44 ) , electron orbital angular momentum ( @xmath43 ) and angular momentum of nuclear rotation ( @xmath49 ) can couple in various ways to form the resultant angular momentum @xmath50 .",

    "on the lower side it can be 34 .",
    "even if we consider the lowest amplification factor one can safely conclude that this molecule can be an effective probe for measuring space time variation of fundamental constants .",
    "since from the above table , the spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath59 and harmonic frequency @xmath6 are very similar in magnitude for sed radical in its ground state electronic multiplet @xmath113 , @xmath114 is quasi - degenerate with @xmath115 level for @xmath116 .",

    "we have found enhanced sensitivity for a number of low frequency microwave transition within @xmath154 and @xmath155 which may enhance the amplification factor upto the order of @xmath156 .",

    "<S> based on the spectroscopic constants derived from highly accurate potential energy surfaces , the sed radical is identified as a spectroscopic probe for measuring spatial and temporal variation of fundamental physical constants such as the fine - structure constant ( denoted as @xmath0 ) and the proton - to - electron mass ratio ( denoted as @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of sed ( @xmath2 ) , due to spin - orbit coupling , splits into two fine structure multiplets @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the potential energy surfaces of these spin - orbit components are derived from a state of the art electronic structure method , mrci+q inclusive of scalar relativistic effects with the spin - orbit effects accounted through the breit - pauli operator . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant spectroscopic data are evaluated using murrel - sorbie fit to the potential energy surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit splitting ( @xmath5 ) between the two multiplets is similar in magnitude with the harmonic frequency ( @xmath6 ) of the diatomic molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the amplification factor ( k ) derived from this theoretical method for this particular molecule can be as large as 350 , on the lower side it can be about 34 . </S>",
    "<S> the significantly large values of k indicate that sed radical can be a plaussible experimental candidate for measuring variation in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    . </S>"
