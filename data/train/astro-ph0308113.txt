    "afterglow of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) , observed in x - ray through radio frequencies , can be interpreted in the fireball models , wherein a shock produced by the interaction of relativistic ejecta with the circumburst environment expands into the surrounding medium , producing broad - band synchrotron emission ( meszaros & rees 1997 ; sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "if the grb is collimated into a jet , the entire jet surface becomes visible to the observers at some time @xmath5 .",
    "as the jet starts to expand laterally at around @xmath5 ( rhoads 1999 ) , its sweeping area increases faster than before , leading to a stronger deceleration and hence a faster afterglow decay .",
    "the rapid decay of some grb afterglows , observed recently , provide evidence for such jet - like or collimated ejecta ( sari , piran , & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "the jet model would relax the energy requirements on some of the more extreme grbs by a factor of several hundred ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the bright and long event , grb020813 , was detected on 2002 august 13 , with the _ hete-2 _ spacecraft ( ricker et al .",
    "the flight localization was reported in a gcn position notice at 02:48:33 ut , 4 min 14 s after the burst trigger .",
    "the subsequent ground analysis of the _ hete-2 _ data produced a refined burst location , which was reported in a gcn position notice at 05:48:35 ut , 184 minutes after the burst .",
    "the location , with 90%-confidence error radius of @xmath6 ( due entirely to systematic errors ) , is centered at @xmath7 ( villasenor et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the optical afterglow was found within the @xmath6-radius error circle at 0.078 days ( 112 minutes ) after the burst , at the coordinates of @xmath8 ( fox et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "optical spectra of the afterglow taken with the keck observatory exhibit numerous absorption lines , indicating a minimum redshift of 1.254 @xmath9 0.005 ( price et al .",
    "early optical light curves of the afterglow are suggested to have undergone a temporal break at 3.5@xmath25 hours after the burst ( bloom et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the kiso observatory of the university of tokyo and the bisei astronomical observatory ( bao ) have established , for the first time in japan , the capability of multi - band follow - up observations of grbs ( urata et al . 2003a ) .",
    "the two sites serve as valuable additions to the world - wide optical and infrared follow - up network , because the japan area would otherwise be blank for the network .    in order to investigate the early (",
    "within 1 day of the burst ) evolution of the optical afterglow of grb020813 in the flux ( e.g. temporal decay and existence of a jet break ) and the spectral slope , we have analyzed the kiso and bao data .",
    "in addition , we analyze the publicly released data of the afterglow obtained by the magellan baade telescope ( gladders and hall , 2002c ) .",
    "we carried out follow - up observations of the optical afterglow of grb020813 with the 1.05 m schmidt telescope and a 2k@xmath102k ccd camera at the kiso observatory , starting at 2002 august 13 10:52 ut ( 0.339 days after the burst ) .",
    "the field of view is @xmath11 and the pixel size is @xmath12 square .",
    "we performed @xmath13- , @xmath14- , @xmath15- , and @xmath1-band observations using a system prepared for the grbs follow - up observations ( urata et al .",
    "we obtained the multi - band data as described in talbe 1 , with each dataset consisting of triple frames .",
    "we also performed @xmath15-band observations using the 1.01-m telescope with a mutoh cv16iie ccd camera ( kodak kaf1602e chip ) at the bao , starting at 2002 august 13 11:44:19 ut ( 0.375 days after the burst ) .",
    "the field of view is @xmath16 and the pixel size is @xmath17 square .",
    "we obtained 36 frames of @xmath15-band data , each with 60 s exposure ( table 1 ) .",
    "an extensive observation of the afterglow was also performed with the magellan baade 6.5 m telescope , on the nights of august 13 and 14 ( 0.13 - 0.94 days after the burst ) .",
    "these data were obtained in the @xmath13- , @xmath14- , @xmath15- , and @xmath1-band each for 60 s , using a tek5 camera ( gladders and hall,2002c ) .",
    "the four - band images , after bias subtraction and flat - fielding , are made publicly available by gladders and halls ( 2002c ) .",
    "we have hence retrieved the images from the ftp site introduced by them .",
    "the data consist of 4 , 13 , 14 , and 21 frames in the @xmath13- , @xmath14- , @xmath15- , and @xmath1-band , respectively .",
    "we processed the kiso and bao data by a standard method using the noao iraf .",
    "we used appropriate calibration data for the bias - subtraction and flat - fielding corrections .",
    "an example of the @xmath1-band images we obtained is shown in figure 1 .",
    "thus , the afterglow is clearly detected in the images of all observations listed in table 1 .",
    "the kiso , bao , and baade data have been combined with median .",
    "flux calibrations among the different sites were done using the apphot package in iraf , referring to the standard stars suggested by henden ( 2002 ) . specifically , we utilized three of them , at the j2000 coordinates of ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , and ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "we set the aperture size to 4 time as large as the fwhm of objects for each data .",
    "we summarize the results of our photometry in table 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows four - band light curves of the optical afterglow based on our measurements .",
    "we thus cover a time period of 0.17 to 0.94 days after the burst in the @xmath14- , @xmath15- , @xmath1-band , with the kiso , bao and baade datasets .",
    "the baade datasets densely cover the early phase ( @xmath3 0.2 days ) , with an additional coverage at 0.94 days .",
    "the kiso and bao data , in contrast , constrain the light curves in the intermediate ( 0.35 - 0.52 days ) range .",
    "first , we tried to fit the @xmath14- , @xmath15- , and @xmath1-band light curves by a simple power law of the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the time after the burst onset and @xmath26 is a constant called decay index .",
    "this gave @xmath27 with reduced @xmath28 of 2.44 for the @xmath14-band , @xmath29 with @xmath30 4.12 for the @xmath15-band , and @xmath31 with @xmath30 53.6 for the @xmath1-band .",
    "thus , none of the three light curves are consistent with a single power - law decay .",
    "next , we tried to fit the light curves with a broken power law model expressed as @xmath32/j;\\\\ j(t , t_{*},\\alpha1,\\alpha2 ) = ( t / t_{*})^{(\\alpha2 - \\alpha1 ) } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are four parameters .",
    "this functional form has no physical significance , but it provides a good description to the grb990510 data , with the asymptotic power - law indices being @xmath35 and @xmath36 at early and late times , respectively ( harrison et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we have successfully fitted the above function to the @xmath14- , @xmath15- , and @xmath1-band light curves . for the @xmath37band ,",
    "we have obtained @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 with @xmath42 11 ) ; for the @xmath43band , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 with @xmath4212 ) ; for the @xmath48band , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 with @xmath4217 ) .",
    "thus , the decay is relatively independent of color , as evidenced by nearly the same values of @xmath53 days found among the three bands .",
    "an initial analysis of the optical light curve suggested @xmath54 hours ( bloom et al .",
    "2002 ; gladders & hall 2002b ) .",
    "we fitted a single power law to the @xmath13-band data , because we lack data before the break .",
    "the obtained index is @xmath55 , with @xmath300.26 .",
    "thus , the slope agrees with the values of @xmath36 found in the three longer wavelengths .    the x - ray afterglow , observed by the _",
    "hetg at 0.88 - 1.78 days after the burst , faded in brightness according to a power law , with a decay index of @xmath56 ( vanderspek et al .",
    "this is close to the optical values we measured after the break .",
    "we have converted the @xmath57 magnitudes to fluxes using the effective wavelengths and normalizations of fukugita et al ( 1995 ) . to remove the effects of the galactic interstellar extinction",
    ", we used the reddening map of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the galactic reddening toward the burst is significant , @xmath58)=0.101 , which implies a galactic extinction of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .    in figure 3",
    ", we plot the spectral flux distributions obtained in this way using the kiso data ( 0.43 days after the burst ) and the baade data ( 0.17 , 0.20 and 0.94 days after the burst ) .",
    "we fitted them with a power - law function as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the flux density at frequency @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the spectral index .",
    "we have obtained @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 at @xmath25= 0.17 , 0.20 , 0.43 , and 0.94 d , respectively .",
    "the former two values of @xmath66 were calculated using the @xmath14- , @xmath15- , and @xmath1-band data , while the latter two values utilized the four - band data .",
    "thus , the measured values of @xmath66 are consistent with being constant at @xmath71 , because fitting them with a constant yields @xmath72 with @xmath423 .",
    "the optical spectral index of the grb020813 afterglow was reported as @xmath73 from red side keck spectra ( 5600@xmath29400@xmath74 ) taken at about @xmath25= 0.19 d ( barth et al . 2003 ) .",
    "correcting it for the galactic extinction quoted above , we obtain @xmath75 .",
    "levan et al . (",
    "2002 ) reported @xmath76 from the _ hst _ imaging data take at @xmath25= 4.08 d. since these measurements consistently imply @xmath66=0.7@xmath40.9 , the spectral slope @xmath66 is suggested to have remained rather constant over a period of @xmath25 = 0.17 to 4.08 d.",
    "we analyzed the grb020813 afterglow images in four bands , observed over a period of 0.33@xmath40.52 days after the burst at the kiso and bisei observatories .",
    "we also re - analyzed the publicly released four - band images taken by the baade 6.5 m telescope ( gladders & hall 2003c ) .",
    "these datasets , when combined , define relatively well - sampled light curves ( in @xmath13- , @xmath14- , @xmath15- , and @xmath1-band ) covering @xmath25= 0.17 to 0.94 d. the @xmath14- , @xmath15- , and @xmath1-band light curves are rather similar , and can be described by a broken power - law of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , with a break point at @xmath79 d. meanwhile , the spectral index of the afterglow remained at @xmath800.9 .",
    "as can be seen from figure 2 , the present kiso and bao data are essential in the determination of the overall light curves .",
    "optical light curves of several grbs exhibit a temporal break at @xmath81 1 d or later .",
    "the decay index of the light curve is typically @xmath82 and @xmath83 , before and after the break , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the afterglow of grb020813 showed an unusually early break time at 0.2 d so far , the earliest break was observed in grb010222 , at 0.73 d ( watanabe et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , the decay index of @xmath84 observed from the present afterglow is smaller than those of other afterglows , while @xmath36 is similar to @xmath35 of other bursts .",
    "these are reminiscent of the afterglow of grb021004 ; its light curve showed an early bump characterized by a brightening phase lasting until @xmath40.07 d , followed by a dimming with a decay index of @xmath85 ( urata et al .",
    "2003b ) which is close to the present @xmath35 .",
    "usually , these temporal breaks are successfully interpreted by the jet model ( rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran , & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "the jet model predicts the time dependent spectral flux to vary as @xmath86 , wherein the temporal decay index @xmath26 and the spectral index @xmath66 are both determined uniquely by the electron power law spectral index @xmath87 . in order to examine whether the jet model is applicable to the present afterglow , we utilized the relations by sari et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and calculated the values of @xmath87 and @xmath26 based on the observed @xmath66 .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 , together with the employed relations .",
    "thus , the vales of @xmath88 we observed are too flat to be reproduced by the jet model under any condition , while those of @xmath89 agree with the model prediction assuming that we are observing a spherical fireball ( i.e. , _ before the break _ ) in the frequency range below the synchrotron cooling .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the behavior of the present light curves _",
    "after _ their apparent break at 0.2 d is consistent with what is expected _ before _ the jet break in terms of the standard jet model .",
    "therefore , the observed break is probably distinct from the usual jet break .",
    "if so , the electron spectral index is inferred from table 4 to be @xmath90 , which falls at the steepest end of the distribution of @xmath87 ( 1.42.8 ; panaiteschu and kumar , 2001 ) ; it is close to that of grb980519 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "if the jet break exists in this burst , it should occur later than @xmath25=0.94 d. we suggest that the mild break observed in the present light curves is reminiscent of a similar break , which was observed in the decay phase of an early bump in the grb021004 afterglow .",
    "the grb021004 afterglow showed a brightening phase over 0.05@xmath40.07 d after the burst based on the kiso observation , followed by a temporal break around 0.2 d across which the decay index changed from 0.2 to 0.7 ( urata et al .",
    "2003b ) . in the case of grb021004 ,",
    "the optical color changed over the bump , but remained constant across the break like in the present light curves ; the behavior may be explained by a crossing of the typical synchrotron frequency through the optical band ( kobayashi and zhang , 2003 ) .",
    "the authors thank gladders & hall for their observations as well as for making their data publicly available .",
