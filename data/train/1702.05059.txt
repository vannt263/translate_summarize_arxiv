    "the direct search for physics beyond the standard model(sm ) has been unsuccessful thus far .",
    "there have been anomalies in some of the observables in the flavour sector , with deviations from the sm predictions at the level of few sigma  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the presence of new physics(np ) at possibly high scales may very well be deduced only from precision measurements of some of the rare meson decays .",
    "the absence of flavour changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at the tree level allows the possibility of virtual new physics particles to be present in the loop level diagrams that contribute to these processes .",
    "detailed study of rare charm decays was performed in ref .",
    "predictions for these decays in various extensions of the sm including extensions of the higgs , gauge and fermion sectors were obtained .",
    "rare charm decays were also recently studied in refs .",
    ". the focus of this study will be the radiative decays of charmed mesons . while both the inclusive and exclusive radiative @xmath2 meson decays have been extensively discussed in the literature ,",
    "less attention has been paid to the @xmath3 meson radiative decays as their branching ratios are expected to be much smaller due to the almost complete gim suppression .",
    "moreover , charm radiative decays will be dominated by long distance contributions , which can hide the presence of new physics particles that may appear in the loop of the short distance penguin contributions .",
    "nevertheless , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that a measurement of the difference in the rates of the exclusive modes , @xmath4 and @xmath5 in which the long distance effects are expected to cancel , would indicate short distance new physics if the data reveals a difference of rates which is more than @xmath6 .",
    "but in general , due to the large uncertainties in the long distance contributions , any definite conclusion regarding np will not be feasible from a measurement of the radiative decay rates for the inclusive @xmath7 case nor for any individual exclusive channel , unless the np short distance contribution is larger than that from the long distance effects .",
    "in fact , the possibility of enhancement above the otherwise dominant long distance effects , in presence of a fourth generation model with large mixing angles of the @xmath8 quark , @xmath9 had been pointed out in ref .  @xcite .",
    "fourth generation models are now inconsistent with the lhc data , however , models with vector - like charge @xmath10 quarks , for which the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claimed that their results were also applicable , are still viable .",
    "in fact , in the last couple of years many detailed studies of the phenomenology of vector - like quarks and constraints from the flavour sector have been performed  @xcite .",
    "apart from the enhancement in the decay rate , which will be subject to the relative size of the short distance and long distance effects , np could also be searched through a measurement of the polarization of the photon produced in the decay .",
    "the sm has a robust prediction regarding the photon polarization in @xmath7 decays and hence , a measurement of the photon polarization can pin down the presence of np .",
    "this had been earlier pointed out for the case of @xmath2 radiative decays in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the sm ,",
    "the photons from the short distance ( sd ) penguin contribution in the @xmath7 decays will be mostly left handed up to corrections of @xmath11(@xmath12 ) .",
    "this dominance of left handed polarization can get masked in the presence of long distance ( ld ) effects .",
    "however , the fraction of the right polarized photons will vary in different models and may possibly even allow one to distinguish between different models of np .",
    "we explore the effects of the presence of a down - type isosinglet vector - like quark model on the @xmath7 decay rate , as well as on the photon polarization for this model with an additional left - right symmetry .",
    "the decay rate evaluation requires an estimation of both the sd as well as ld components , which are described in the next section . in sec .",
    "[ vlq ] some details of the down type isosinglet vector - like quark model are discussed , including the modifications to the wilson coefficients in its presence .",
    "[ lrsm ] contains a short discussion on lrsm and the results for the bare level sd contributions to the amplitudes for the emission of the left and right handed photons in this model .",
    "[ iva ] gives our results for the branching ratios ( br s ) in the sm and in the different np models . in sec .",
    "[ ivb ] we present our analysis of the polarization function in the lrsm and the lrsm with vector - like quark . finally in sec .",
    "[ v ] , we conclude .",
    "the long distance contributions being non - perturbative in nature are hard to estimate .",
    "the long distance contributions can come either from pole diagrams or vector meson dominance ( vmd ) diagrams . at the quark level",
    ", the pole contribution corresponds to the annihilation diagrams @xmath13 with a photon attached to any of the four quark lines .",
    "they are actually a subset of a more general class of long distance contributions , which include two - particle intermediate states and extends up to all higher n - particle intermediate states .",
    "phenomenologically however , the single - particle or pole terms are the most accessible .",
    "the underlying quark processes in the vmd contributions are @xmath14 , followed by @xmath15 .",
    "all these long distance effects are rather hard to calculate from first principles but can be estimated in models .",
    "hence , it is important that the observables chosen for uncovering np be independent of the long distance effects .",
    "however , we provide an updated estimate for the long distance amplitudes and branching ratios for charm decays following the methods of ref .",

    "while the enhancement was by a factor of two in the case of @xmath36 , it was expected to be more dramatic in the case of charm radiative decays  @xcite .",

    "<S> we show that for a heavy vector - like quark model with a down type isosinglet , branching ratio for @xmath0 decay is enhanced by more than @xmath1 as compared to that in the standard model when qcd corrections to next - to - leading order are incorporated . in a left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) along with a heavy vector - like fermion , enhancement of this order can be achieved at the bare ( qcd uncorrected ) level itself . </S>",
