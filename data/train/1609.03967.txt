    "this paper presents new results in the bifurcation theory of vector fields by exploring a three - dimensional heteroclinic structure called _ singular cycle _ started in morales and pacfico @xcite . in general",
    ", a singular cycle is a finite set of hyperbolic non - trivial periodic solutions and at least one hyperbolic equilibrium , which are linked in a cyclic way by trajectories in the intersections of their respective stable and unstable manifolds . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate a singular cycle between a unique equilibrium @xmath0 and a unique periodic solution @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the stable manifolds of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are two - dimensional .",
    "therefore , generically , the heteroclinic connection from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is of codimension one , while that from @xmath1 to @xmath0 is of codimension zero , as an intersection of two - dimensional manifolds in three - dimensional space .",
    "such a codimension one cycle is referred to as an _",
    "@xmath2-cycle _ by champneys _",
    "et al . _",
    "we focus our attention on the case where the stable manifold of @xmath0 intersects the unstable manifold of @xmath1 tangentially , turning the cycle into a codimension two phenomenon , called _",
    "@xmath3-cycle _ in @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the case where the linearization at the equilibrium @xmath0 has only real eigenvalues and @xmath1 has positive floquet multipliers .",
    "our first main result is the characterization of the dynamics in the organizing center , theorem [ main - thm ] : depending on the sign of the parameters that determine the transitions between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( _ i.e. _  inward or outward fold of the unstable manifold of @xmath1 , inclination flip or not ) we prove the existence of different types of shift dynamics near the cycle .",
    "this complements the results of @xcite by addressing the case where the cycle is not necessarily isolated . in theorem [ thm - hyp ]",
    "we also partially answer the question of hyperbolicity for the non - wandering set associated to the singular cycle , when restricted to a compact set not containing the cycle .",
    "a boundary crisis is a mechanism for destroying a chaotic set when the parameters vary .",
    "the locus of boundary crises can contain regions of positive lebesgue measure that mark the beginning of the chaotic regime ; in general this mechanism is related with quasi - stochastic attractors and wild phenomena . in our two - parameter setting , these global bifurcations are associated with curves of homo- and heteroclinic tangencies of invariant saddles , and the complete understanding of the phenomenon is far from being done .    in the present paper ,",
    "we give a generic description of the boundary crisis for the cases with shift dynamics in the organizing center . in theorems [ thm - e - hom ] and [ thm - p - hom ]",
    "we study the presence of multipulse homoclinic solutions , _",

    "they accumulate on the curves of one - pulse homoclinic solutions described in @xcite .",
    "theorem [ thm - pe - het ] contains a corresponding result for multipulse heteroclinic connections from @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "the homo- and heteroclinic tangencies we encounter are related to the work of hittmeyer _ et al . _  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.3 ) , who ( numerically ) study the transition between different types of wild chaos .",
    "our results add information to the bifurcation diagrams in @xcite , and bring them another step closer to completion .",

    "( continuation of the homoclinic cycles to @xmath0 near the original cycle ) .",
    "this type of degenerate singular cycle arises in several applications : for instance , champneys _ et al . _",

    "@xmath3-cycles come up in the context of semiconductor lasers with optical reinjection , as noted by krauskopf and oldeman in @xcite and studied further in @xcite .",
    "we take a general bifurcation theoretical standpoint and are interested in how these cycles act as _ organizing centers _ for homoclinic bifurcations associated to the equilibrium @xmath0 and the periodic solution @xmath1 .",

    "studies of the codimension two @xmath3-cycles include @xcite .",
    "the second reference focuses on isolated cycles and is primarily concerned with the prevalence of hyperbolicity near an @xmath3-cycle : they show that for generic families of vector fields passing through a vector field with an @xmath3-cycle , the set of parameters corresponding to hyperbolic flows has full lebesgue measure ( assuming the cycle is contracting ) . in doing so , they extend a corresponding result for @xmath2-cycles in @xcite . champneys and coworkers @xcite give a detailed geometric analysis of the dynamics near an @xmath3-cycle , they investigate the existence of one - pulse @xmath0-homoclinics and @xmath1-homoclinic tangencies as well as periodic solutions close to the heteroclinic cycle .",
    "moreover , in the presence of non - real eigenvalues , they study homoclinic snaking behaviour and give numerical examples of corresponding systems that arise in applications . a mode of intracellular calcium dynamics has also been studied .",
    "it is our aim to contribute to extend these studies .    in recent years",
    "the continuation of homoclinic orbits unfolding heteroclinic cycles received a great deal of attention .",
    "motivated by the swift - hohenberg equation of subcritical type , a rigorous analysis in the conservative and reversible context including the study near the periodic solution has been established in beck _ et al .",

    "moreover , we also refer to rademacher @xcite where the author studied the dynamics near singular cycles .",
    "the _ homoclinic snaking problem _ refers to the snaking continuation curve ( in the bifurcation diagram ) of homoclinic cycles near an @xmath2-cycle .",
    "this topic has been explored in knobloch and rie  @xcite , where the authors apply lin s method to a differential equation unfolding a saddle - node hopf bifurcation with global reinjection introduced in @xcite .",
    "detection and continuation of homoclinic cycles circulating several times around a cycle ( later called multipulses ) have been studied by knobloch _",
