    "these two mean - field disordered models present a freezing transition with similar thermodynamic properties . in particular , between the high temperature phase of extensive entropy and the low - temperature phase of finite entropy , the entropy at criticality scales as @xmath7 in both models .",
    "however , the statistical properties of the weights which coincide in the low - temperature phase become different at the critical point . in the rem ,",
    "all critical properties are governed by the finite - size exponent @xmath6 : the typical values @xmath8 decay as @xmath9 , and the disorder - averaged values @xmath10 are governed by rare events and decay as @xmath11 for any @xmath12 . in the dpct",
    ", we find that the weight statistics is not governed by the exponent @xmath6 of the thermodynamics , but by another exponent @xmath13 that had been previously mentioned in @xcite in connection with finite - size corrections to the free - energy below and at @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , the typical values @xmath8 decay as @xmath15 , and the disorder - averaged values @xmath10 decay as @xmath16 for any @xmath12 .",
    "we have also presented numerical histograms at criticality for the entropy , the maximal weight @xmath29 and @xmath30 . we have emphasized the role of the rare samples that are still frozen at @xmath68 ( i.e. the rare samples having @xmath89 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) since it is the amplitude of these rare events that governs the disorder averaged values @xmath10 as well as the overlap probability density @xmath201 of full overlap @xmath20 . in particular , we have obtained that beside the delta function @xmath19 which bears the whole normalization , the disorder averaged asymptotic probability distribution @xmath224 contains an isolated point at @xmath20 as a memory of the delta peak @xmath21 of the low - temperature phase @xmath22 .",
    "the associated value @xmath23 is finite for the dpct , and diverges as @xmath24 for the rem .",
    "concerning the weight statistics at criticality for the directed polymer , let us finish by some comparison between the mean - field version on the cayley tree considered here and the finite dimensional version that we have studied recently in @xcite .",
    "we should first recall that in finite dimension @xmath225 , the weights of the @xmath226 possible spatial positions of the polymer end - point do not coincide with the configuration weights , in contrast with the cayley tree where the end - points are in one - to - one correspondence with the @xmath5 configurations .",
    "in finite dimension , the probability distributions of the maximal weight @xmath29 and of @xmath30 reach the values @xmath227 and @xmath228 only for @xmath229 , where @xmath230 @xcite , whereas on the cayley tree these two temperatures coincide @xmath231 .",
    "this is why on the cayley tree , the disorder averaged values @xmath232 for @xmath12 all decay with a @xmath107-independent exponent @xmath233 representing the amplitude of rare events where @xmath140 , whereas in finite dimension , the disorder averaged values @xmath232 decay as @xmath234 where the exponents @xmath235 have a finite limit @xmath236 .",
    "also in finite dimension , the comparison with the exponents @xmath237 governing the decay of typical values @xmath238 show that the threshold @xmath239 between the region @xmath240 where they coincide @xmath241 and the region @xmath242 where they differ @xmath243 is of order @xmath244 @xcite , whereas on the cayley tree , the exponents for averaged and typical values are always different as soon as @xmath12 .",
    "so the role of rare events is stronger on the cayley tree .",
    "in this appendix , we recall some properties of lvy sums with @xmath31 , since their weight statistics is the same as in the random energy model in the low - temperature phase with @xmath245 .",
    "the sum @xmath246 of @xmath247 positive independent variables @xmath248 distributed with a probability distribution that decays algebraically @xmath249 has very special property when @xmath250 since the first moment diverges @xmath251 @xcite : the sum @xmath252 grows as @xmath253 , and the rescaled variable is distributed with a stable lvy distribution .",
    "another important property is that the maximal variable @xmath254 among the @xmath247 variables @xmath255 is also of order @xmath253 , i.e. the sum @xmath252 is actually dominated by the few biggest terms . to quantify this effect , it is convenient to introduce the weights @xmath256 and their moments @xmath257    the link with the weight statistics in the random energy model can be understood as follows .",
    "the lowest energy in the rem is distributed exponentially @xmath258 this exponential form that corresponds to the tail of the gumbel distribution for extreme - value statistics @xcite , immediately yields that the boltzmann weight @xmath259 has a distribution that decays algebraically ( eq . [ levymu ] ) with exponent @xmath260 in the rem , the coefficient @xmath261 in the exponential ( eq . [ tailexp ] ) is @xmath262 .",
    "let us also mention that in the mean - field sk model of spin - glasses , exactly the same expressions of @xmath14 ( eq . [ yklevy ] ) also appear @xcite , but with a different interpretation : the weights are those of the pure states .",
    "as a consequence , the parameter @xmath263 which is a complicated function of the temperature vanishes at the transition @xmath264 ( only one pure state in the high temperature state ) and grows at @xmath265 is lowered towards @xmath266 of order @xmath267 @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the rem model where @xmath245 grows with the temperature from @xmath268 ( only one ground state ) to @xmath269 at the transition , where the number of important microscopic states is not finite anymore .",
    "nevertheless , the expression ( eq . [ yklevy ] ) for the weights of pure states means that the free - energy @xmath270 of pure states in the sk model is distributed exponentially @xmath271 with a parameter @xmath272 .",
    "the averaged values in the limit @xmath274 are finite for @xmath250 and reads @xcite @xmath275 let us recall how one derives this result @xcite , since it will be useful for the critical case @xmath27 considered in appendix [ app_muc ] .",
