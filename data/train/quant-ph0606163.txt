    "quite recently a growing attention has been devoted to interacting spin systems @xcite also in view of the fact that they can be successfully used for gate operations in solid state quantum computation processors @xcite .",
    "they indeed provide scalable systems that can be easily integrated into standard silicon technology .",
    "spin sets with an assigned one- or multi - dimensional spatial distribution appear to be comparatively more promising candidates for the realization of entangled states in matter systems .",
    "numerous papers published over the last few years witness the central role played by spin systems , both from a theoretical and applicative point of view , in the emerging field of quantum entanglement in solid state physics . as an example , and in connection to the subject we are going to discuss in the present paper , it is worth explicitly citing those papers dealing with investigation on the entanglement get established within a pair of spins belonging to a spin ensemble whose dynamics is dominated by xxx @xcite , xxz @xcite , xyz @xcite and xy @xcite heisenberg interaction models . in these cases",
    "the analysis is developed through the evaluation of the concurrence function appropriate to estimate the degree of quantum correlations get established in a two - spin system .",
    "it is important to underline that generally speaking quantifying and controlling entanglement is a crucial challenge both from a theoretical point of view and in consideration of its applicative potentialities in various field of quantum information .",
    "it is in addition important to stress that studying spin systems is however of remarkable interest in its own .",
    "it is well known , for example , that a magnetic sample can be suitably analyzed adopting a general hamiltonian model describing a system of @xmath2 spins coupled by exchange interactions with arbitrary range and strength @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the quantum dynamics of a system of @xmath0 heisenberg pairwise coupled spins @xmath1 investigating in particular the time evolution of the entanglement get established within a spin pair subsystem .",
    "the analysis here reported enable us to bring to light a new conceptual and quantitative link between the concurrence function and an observable quantity having a clear physical meaning suggesting , at the same time , a simple way of measuring entanglement in a two spin system without necessarily reconstructing its state .",
    "our approach focusses on a generalized spin star system whose dynamics provides an enlightening key to go deep into the physical meaning of entanglement and concurrence . in this framework",
    "we succeed in giving a simple recipe to control the ability of the system in developing only classical or also quantum correlations .",
    "our physical system consists of @xmath0 two - level objects whose quantum dynamics is completely described by spin operators @xmath3 @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the pauli matrix operator pertaining to the @xmath6th two - level subsystem .",
    "the cartesian components of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , fulfill the usual angular momentum commutation relations and @xmath10 denote the two eigenstates of @xmath11 that is @xmath12 .    in this section",
    "we wish to keep our presentation general enough to encompass several possible physical scenarios of interest .",
    "thus we adopt the assumption that a spin pair @xmath13",
    "belonging to our ensemble of @xmath0 spins @xmath14 experiences an heisenberg exchange - like interaction describable as proportional to @xmath15 . the hamiltonian model representing such a physical situation in the interaction picture with respect to the free hamiltonian @xmath16 may be cast in the following general form @xmath17 @xmath18 being a real coupling constant left undetermined at the moment . since @xmath19 is a scalar operator with respect to @xmath20 and in addition commutes with @xmath21 , then the @xmath22component of @xmath23 as well as @xmath24 are constants of motion . as a consequence , preparing the @xmath0 spins in an eigenstate of @xmath25 , the total system evolves in the correspondent invariant hilbert subspace .",
    "it is not difficult to convince oneself that the reduced density matrix relative to a prefixed couple of spins , say the spins @xmath26 and @xmath27 , when expressed into the standard two - spin basis @xmath28 assumes a block diagonal form , each block being biunivocally singled out by one of the three possible eigenvalues of @xmath29@xmath30 .",
    "stated another way , the reduced density matrix @xmath31 , obtained tracing the density operator of the closed system over the degrees of freedom relative to all the @xmath0 spins except @xmath26 and @xmath27 , assumes the quite simple form @xmath32 when represented in the ordered basis given by eq .",
    "( [ standard basis ] ) @xcite .",
    "we wish to stress that the possibility of writing @xmath31 as in eq .",
    "( [ rogenerica ] ) directly stems from the initial preparation being instead independent on the values of the coupling constants set @xmath33 . on the contrary , the matrix elements of @xmath34 depend on this set too .",
    "scope of this section is to prove the existence of dynamical properties of our system of @xmath0 spins relying solely on the structure of the density matrix @xmath31 and not on the specific form of the functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , ... , @xmath37 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ rogenerica ] ) .",
    "this circumstance appears still more remarkable at the light of the fact that , generally speaking , it is not possible to exactly solve the dynamics of @xmath0 interacting spins described by the hamiltonian model ( [ generalh ] ) . thus results obtained just exploiting the form of the two - spin reduced density operator @xmath31 ( [ rogenerica ] ) , besides being valid whatever the coupling constants are , also provide peculiar tools to test approximate dynamical solutions when we are unable to exactly solve the system dynamics .    with these considerations in mind ,",
    "we now focus on a system of two spins @xmath1 described at a generic time instant @xmath38 by a density matrix like ( [ rogenerica ] ) without specifying the analytic expression of the four population functions @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath36,@xmath39 , @xmath37 and the coherence function @xmath40 .",
    "let s begin by observing that in order to guarantee that the operator given by equation ( [ rogenerica ] ) represents indeed a density matrix , the inequality @xmath41 must be satisfied at any time instant @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate that this relation directly stems from the requirement that all the eigenvalues of @xmath34 are not negative .    an interesting property assumed by each density matrix belonging to the class defined by eq .",
    "( [ rogenerica ] ) concerns the possibility of getting a bridge between the peres - horodecki ( p - h ) separability condition @xcite and the measure of entanglement proposed by wootters @xcite .",
    "the p - h separability criterium claims that the density matrix @xmath42 of a bipartite system composed by two - level subsystems , is separable if and only if all the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath43 obtained from @xmath42 transposing with respect to the indices of only one subsystem , are not negative . in our case",
    "such a matrix , built up from @xmath34 , may be cast as follows @xmath44 thus applying the p - h separability criterium , it is easy to demonstrate that our two - spin density matrix ( [ rogenerica ] ) is separable at a fixed time instant @xmath38 if and only if the condition @xmath45 is fulfilled . on the other hand , when the density operator of two two - level systems has the simple form of eq .",
    "( [ rogenerica ] ) it is quite straightforward to evaluate the concurrence function @xmath46 , introduced by wootters as a measure of entanglement in bipartite system composed by two qubits , getting @xmath47    considering eq .",
    "( [ conc ] ) we immediately deduce that at a generic time instant @xmath38 the system is characterized by absence of entanglement if and only if condition ( [ separability condition ] ) is satisfied in accordance with the p - h separability criterium .",
    "let s in addition remark that the presence of entanglement at a time instant @xmath38 necessarily implies the existence of at least a couple of operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 acting on the bidimensional hilbert spaces of the spin @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , such that the correlation function @xmath50 is different from zero . in eq .",
    "( [ covab ] ) @xmath51 @xmath52 is the reduced density matrix of the spin @xmath53 and @xmath54 denotes the trace with respect to its degrees of freedom . at the light of the results expressed by eq .",
    "( [ separability condition ] ) and ( [ conc ] ) a suitable pair of operators satisfying eq .",
    "( [ covab ] ) must at least fulfill the condition of not being diagonal in the standard basis ( [ standard basis ] ) .",
    "thus we are lead to consider the two operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 . exploiting the form of @xmath31 as given by eq .",
    "( [ rogenerica ] ) it is immediate to demonstrate that @xmath57}\\ ] ] since @xmath58 and @xmath59}\\ ] ]    if instead we analogously consider the two operators @xmath60 and @xmath61 we obtain @xmath62}\\ ] ] a comparison among eqs .",
    "( [ cx ] ) , ( [ cy ] ) and ( [ conc ] ) brings to light the existence of a new direct link between the concurrence function and measurable quantities of clear physical meaning .",
    "we may indeed claim that when different from zero the concurrence function may be expressed as @xmath63 @xmath35 and @xmath37 being the probability of finding both the spins @xmath26 and @xmath27 in their up states or down states respectively .",
    "it is in addition rather remarkable the fact that if @xmath64 and/or @xmath65 the concurrence as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ conc ] ) reduces to @xmath66}^2+\\im{[c(t)]}^2}\\equiv \\sqrt{c_{\\sigma_x \\sigma_x}^2+c_{\\sigma_y \\sigma_y}^2}\\ ] ] so that it is zero only if both the two quantum covariances @xmath67 and @xmath68 vanish .",
    "this elegant formula suggests in a very transparent way that the covariances between the @xmath69 and @xmath70 components of the two spins are suitable quantities in order to highlight the presence of entanglement in our two - spin system .",
    "it is however important to emphasize that @xmath71 @xmath72 does nt necessarily imply in its own that the system has developed quantum correlations .",
    "this aspect will appear more clear in the next section where we will analyze the exact dynamics of a specific system whose hamiltonian model is a particular case of that expressed by equation ( [ generalh ] ) . concluding this section we wish to stress that the quite simple form of @xmath31 , given by eq .",
    "( [ rogenerica ] ) , which represents the starting point of our analysis , naturally arises in many physical contexts not necessarily involving spin @xmath1 systems .",
    "in particular the conditions under which eq .",
    "( [ conc cx cy ] ) has been derived are verified for example when the dynamics of two isolated atoms , each in its own jaynes - cummings cavity is studied @xcite . in this sense , we may claim that the concepts and tools reported in this paper are flexible enough to be exported into physical situations more general than the spin system here envisaged .",
    "appropriately choosing the coupling constants @xmath18 the quite general hamiltonian model ( [ generalh ] ) can describe very different physical scenarios . here",
    "we wish to focus on the case of a system composed by a pair of not directly interacting spins each one coupled to every two - level component of a set of @xmath2 spins by a physical mechanism representable by a xy heisenberg exchange like term .",
    "if we stipulate the absence of any internal coupling within the set of @xmath2 spins , hereafter referred to as the spin bath , and indicate by @xmath73 and @xmath74 the two spins of the preferred couple , also called the central system , the hamiltonian model ( [ generalh ] ) assumes the following form @xmath75 it is worth noticing that specializing the hamiltonian model given by eq .",
    "( [ generalh ] ) into the one expressed by eq .",
    "( [ hxy ] ) we are supposing that the spin @xmath73 and @xmath74 couples with any element of the bath with a site - independent coupling constant @xmath76 or @xmath77 respectively .",
    "the interest toward this system , representing a generalization of those systems reported in literature as spin star systems @xcite , arises from several considerations .",
    "first of all , as we are going to show , it is exactly solvable so that in this case we can explicitly know the functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , ... , @xmath37 appearing in the density matrix given by eq .",
    "( [ rogenerica ] ) .",
    "this circumstance allows us to explore conditions for the emergence of and to investigate on the time evolution of correlations get established within the pair @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "a specific aspect of this study is in particular , the possibility of controlling the rising of only classical or also quantum correlations between the two not directly interacting spins in the central subsystem .",
    "another important point worth to be emphasized is the fact that under appropriate initial conditions , the concurrence appearing and evolving within the @xmath78 subsystem may be traced back and interpreted in terms of simple measurable quantities . as a consequence we are in condition to suggest a way to measure the concurrence in laboratory without being obliged to reconstruct , as usually required , the state of the system .",
    "let s begin by observing that the possibility of exactly solving the dynamics of the system described by ( [ hxy ] ) , is strictly related to the existence of other constants of motion with respect to the general model ( [ generalh ] ) .",
    "introducing the bath collective operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 and casting the interaction hamiltonian  ( [ hxy ] ) in the form @xmath81 it is indeed easy to convince oneself that @xmath82=0\\ ] ] @xmath83=0\\ ] ] @xmath84 being an intermediate angular momentum resulting from the coupling of selected at will individual angular momenta of the bath .",
    "for example defining @xmath85 , or @xmath86 , we deduce @xmath87=0\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;[h_{xy},j_{i , j , k}^2]=0\\ ] ]    in order to make more evident how the existence of all these constants of motion provides the possibility of exactly solving the dynamics of the closed system constituted by the central one @xmath88 and the spin bath , let s denote by @xmath89 a bath coupled basis satisfying @xmath90 @xmath91 being an integer index taking into account the degeneracy with respect to the quantum numbers @xmath92 and @xmath0 . as far as the ordered basis of the @xmath88 subsystem given by eq .",
    "( [ standard basis ] ) , we introduce the new more compact notation @xmath93 putting @xmath94 we can thus denote by @xmath95@xmath96 a generic state of the basis of the hilbert space of the total system obtained as tensorial product of the two bases previously introduced .",
    "it is immediate to convince oneself that the dynamical constraints imposed by the constants of motion put into evidence at the beginning of this section , allow us to claim that , starting from a state @xmath97 , at a generic time instant @xmath38 the state of the system will be at most a linear superposition of four states as follows    @xmath98    we have demonstrated that it is possible to explicitly find the exact form of the amplitudes @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ time evolution ] ) whatever the state of the coupled basis chosen as initial state is . here , for simplicity",
    ", we do not give their analytical expressions also because , generally speaking , they are highly involved .",
    "however it is important to stress that , knowing the functions @xmath99 , ... @xmath102 whatever @xmath103 and @xmath0 are , we , at least in principle , can evaluate the temporal evolution of the closed system from a generic initial state .",
    "we now concentrate on a specific initial condition namely the one wherein the two central spins are initially prepared one up and the other one down whereas the bath is in its eigenstate of minimum free energy : @xmath104    we remark that the couple @xmath105 , @xmath106 is not degenerate so that @xmath107 only .",
    "the time evolution of the system starting from this initial condition is characterized by the fact that the probability of finding the two spins of interest in the state @xmath108 is zero at any time instant @xmath38 .",
    "this circumstance directly follows from the boundaries imposed to the dynamics of the system by the conservation of the @xmath109 component of the total angular momentum .",
    "moreover it is possible to prove that in the case under scrutiny the matrix element @xmath40 is real .",

    "( [ cx ] ) and ( [ conc cx cy ] ) we may thus claim that in the case here analyzed , measuring the covariance @xmath116 corresponds to directly detect the entanglement arisen between @xmath73 and @xmath74 being @xmath117 as easily demonstrable looking at eqs .",
    "( [ b(t)ab])-([e(t)ab ] ) .",
