    "supernova explosions produce strong shock waves propagating into the interstellar medium ( ism ) . whereas these shocks are usually associated with bright optical forbidden lines from metals ( radiative shocks ) and permitted lines from hydrogen , a small subsample of supernova remnants ( snrs ) exhibit faint balmer - dominated shocks which are characterized by h lines and very weak forbidden lines from lowly - ionized metals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "diagnostics of the h line profile have been used to probe  collisionless \" shocks , where the shock transition occurs effectively by collective interactions of the plasma with the magnetic field rather than coulomb collisions . the h line profile behind a balmer - dominated shock consists of narrow and broad components .",
    "the narrow component arises from collisional excitation of cold neutrals that pass through the shock , and the broad component arises from collisional excitation and cascading processes of hot neutrals that are created by charge exchange ( cx ) reactions between hot downstream protons heated at the shock and the cold neutrals unaffected by the shock transition region @xcite",
    ". therefore , the widths of the narrow and broad components should reflect temperatures of unshocked neutrals and shocked protons , respectively .",
    "it has been a long - standing problem that the widths of the narrow component , fwhms @xmath6kms@xmath4 , are broader than the thermal width expected in the ism , roughly 21 ( @xmath7/10@xmath8k)@xmath9kms@xmath4 .",
    "although the broadening can be partly due to heating by a photoionization precursor from postshock emission such as he ii @xmath10304",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this effect is insufficient to quantitatively explain the width observed .",
    "various possibilities have been considered in the interpretation of the nature of the additional broadening @xcite . of these ,",
    "the most likely is a cosmic - ray ( cr ) precursor , in which the gas is heated by damping of alfvn / sound waves emitted by crs and/or is disturbed by alfvn wave turbulence .",
    "@xcite discovered a possible cr precursor associated with a balmer - dominated shock at the eastern edge ( knot g : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in tycho s snr , where both the intensity and width of the h@xmath0 line gradually increases within a thin ( @xmath110@xmath11 cm ) region ahead of the shock .",
    "@xcite showed that the precursor can heat the gas by damping of sound waves from crs via an acoustic instability .",
    "so far , it is the only known example of a promising cr precursor . therefore , it is essential to accumulate observational information about cr precursors by observing other balmer - dominated shocks .",
    "balmer - dominated shocks in the cygnus loop offer a unique opportunity for the study of thin precursors , thanks to its proximity  it is the closest ( @xmath12540@xmath13pc : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) among 11 snrs ( both in our galaxy and the lmc ) associated with balmer - dominated shocks , with 1@xmath14 corresponding to @xmath15pc .",
    "recently , @xcite performed high - resolution spectroscopy of a number of shocks along with diffuse emission 2.5@xmath16 ahead of northeastern ( ne ) shocks of the cygnus loop .",
    "they found that h@xmath0 line widths in the diffuse regions are as narrow as @xmath129kms@xmath4 , while h@xmath0 profiles of the shocks themselves consist of broader narrow ( @xmath136kms@xmath4 ) and broad ( @xmath1250kms@xmath4 ) components .",
    "they suggested that the h@xmath0 broadening of @xmath129kms@xmath4 in the diffuse region is due to photoionization , and speculated that the additional broadening of the narrow component at the shock originates from a thin cr precursor . like tycho s knot g",
    "@xcite , such a thin precursor may be detected by spatially - resolved spectroscopy of the balmer - dominated shock .    here , we present high - resolution long - slit spectra which are spatially resolved perpendicular to the best - studied balmer - dominated shock in the cygnus loop @xcite .",
    "consistent with the previous optical spectroscopy @xcite , we detect a diffuse precursor ahead of the shock throughout the slit position .",
    "we find that the width of the narrow component increases within an unresolved region at the shock , which we attribute to heating by damping of alfvn waves in a cr precursor .",
    "we present our observations and results in section  2 , and interpretations in section  3 .",
    "we observed one of the brightest balmer - dominated shocks in the ne limb of the cygnus loop on 2015 august 31 , using the _ subaru _ high dispersion spectrogram ( hds : * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we use a long slit together with the h@xmath0 order - blocking filter .",
    "the slit width is 1@xmath14 , which gives velocity resolution of fwhm=9kms@xmath4 .",
    "the slit was centered at ( ra , decl . )",
    "= ( 20:56:04.8 , + 31:56:46.7 ) ( j2000 ) , with a position angle of 46@xmath17 measured north of east as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ( a ) .",
    "this way , we investigate spatial variations of the line profile along the shock normal , i.e. , parallel to the shock motion .",
    "the total exposure time was 6@xmath1830 minutes , which was reduced to 2.5 hr after rejecting one frame affected by fog .",
    "the spectrum was binned by 2 pixels for both the dispersion axis and the slit direction , so that the pixel scales after the binning were 0.0364 / pixel and 0.276@xmath14/pixel , respectively .",
    "the wavelength range covered by this observation is 65156589 .",
    "the seeing was about 0.5@xmath14 .",

    ", we utilize the version 2.16 of the iraf software .",
    "figure  [ fig : image ] ( b ) shows a fully processed two - dimensional spectrum of the h@xmath0 line , for which the x- and y - axis are responsible for the wavelength and the slit position ( top is to the ne ) , respectively .",
    "the four blobs near the bottom correspond to the balmer - dominated shocks 14 .",
    "since we did not obtain a sky background frame separately , we adopt the far upstream region between two dotted horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ( b ) as our background .",
    "the background - subtracted h@xmath0 intensity profiles along the slit position are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ( c ) , where the black and red are responsible for narrow and broad components , respectively .",
    "the broad component arises immediately behind the bright shocks , whereas the narrow component extends ahead of them as indicated by arrows with  photoionization precursor \" in the plot ( see below ) .    to investigate spatial variations of the h@xmath0 profile ,",
    "we extract one - dimensional spectra from 21 regions along the slit , as indicated by a vertical scale bar in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ( b ) .",
    "the regions are divided such that brighter regions have smaller widths with a minimum width of 2 pixels or 0.55@xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows a background - subtracted one - dimensional spectrum taken from the brightest region indicated by a horizontal arrow in fig .  [ fig : image ] ( b ) , together with the background spectrum in green .",
    "the h@xmath0 line profile can be reproduced by two gaussian components : a broad component ( dotted red line ) arising from a shock - heated gas and a narrow component ( dotted black line ) arising from unshocked neutrals .",
    "another small peak at 6583.4  is the [ n ii ] line originating from the cygnus loop itself .",
    "below , we will fit both of these two lines by either a single gaussian or double gaussians , after taking account of instrumental broadening of fwhm=9kms@xmath4 .",
    "our analysis shows that only a narrow gaussian component is required in the precursor , with an upper limit of broad - to - narrow intensity ratios ( @xmath19 ) of 0.3 . on the other hand ,",
    "two gaussian components are required at the balmer - dominated shocks and its interior where @xmath19 ratios range from 0.75@xmath30.02 to 2.01@xmath10.08 .",
    "such a strong @xmath19 difference between the precursor and the balmer - dominated shock clearly demonstrates that the precursor is not the result of geometric projection of fainter balmer - dominated shocks , but an intrinsic precursor associated with the bright shocks .",
    "the [ n ii ] line profiles can be fitted by a single , narrow gaussian throughout the slit .",
    "we measure the width of the [ n ii ] line to be narrower than fwhm=8kms@xmath4 ( after considering the instrumental resolution ) all along the slit position , which allows us to infer the n temperature to be @xmath20k , consistent with the h temperature in the photoionization precursor . also , there is a good correlation between the h@xmath0 flux and [ n ii ] flux within the photoionization precursor ( @xmath21 } + 511 $ ] photons ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nha_vs_n2 ] .",
    "these facts lead us to conclude that the [ n ii ] line entirely arises from the photoionization precursor .",
    "this idea is in agreement with the earlier interpretation for the origin of the extremely faint forbidden line emission including [ n ii ] and [ s ii ] lines from the relevant balmer - dominated shock @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : results ] shows the best - fit gaussian parameters as a function of the slit position , where @xmath22 corresponds to the bottom line of the two - dimensional spectrum in fig .  [ fig : image ] ( b ) . within the precursor region ( @xmath23 ) , the width of the h@xmath0 line and the h@xmath0/[n ii ] intensity ratio are roughly constant at 28.9@xmath30.7kms@xmath4 ( error - weighted mean fwhm ) and 12.1@xmath30.2 , respectively , fully consistent with those of a photoionization precursor in the ne cygnus loop @xcite .",
    "we find from fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] ( b ) that the narrow component s width abruptly increases from the precursor region to 33.1@xmath30.2kms@xmath4 ( error - weighted mean fwhm ) within a remarkably thin ( unresolved ) layer at the shock position .",
    "we have ruled out a possibility that the sudden broadening is an artifact due to the broad component , based on the fact that the line width does not change much whether or not we introduce the broad component in the narrow - band fitting .",
    "the flux of the narrow component in the photoionization precursor gradually increases from a far upstream region to the shock front .",
    "this may be caused by projection effects  increasing line - of - sight column densities toward the shock , which would be applicable to the relevant shock showing an interaction with a cloud @xcite .",
    "the line centroids of the broad and narrow components , which are taken to be the same between the narrow and broad components in our analysis , do not show significant spatial variations except for the innermost region ( @xmath24 ) .    as for the broad component , the width decreases from the outermost shock ( 230@xmath320kms@xmath4 ) to the innermost shock ( 130@xmath35kms@xmath4 ) within the four bright balmer - dominated shocks .",
    "the difference by a factor of @xmath12 can be reasonably interpreted as a result of different shock speeds ; we have checked that the outermost balmer - dominated shock is moving @xmath11.5 times faster than the other three shocks , based on our own proper - motion measurements by data from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "we see an even broader ( 330@xmath25kms@xmath4 ) line at the innermost region",
    ". some of the width may be the projected bulk speed of the shocked gas , if the region is projected at a significant angle , and if both front and back surfaces contribute .",
    "the presence of the [ n ii ] line at the bright balmer - dominated shocks ( x@xmath26 ) suggests a possible contamination from the photoionization precursor due to projection . in other words , the h@xmath0 line at the balmer - dominated shock is a mixture of the narrow ( 29kms@xmath4 ) and a broader narrow ( @xmath2733kms@xmath4 ) component .",
    "other hints of such a contamination include ( 1 ) the @xmath19 ratio gradually decreases from the innermost shock to the outermost shock ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] ( a ) ) , and ( 2 ) the narrow component s width becomes narrower at inter - blob regions than blobs themselves ( fig .  [ fig : results ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "therefore , we try to eliminate the contamination from the photoionization precursor . using the [ n ii ] flux and the relation between @xmath28 and @xmath29}$ ] , we estimate the contaminating h@xmath0 flux .",
    "we then refit the h@xmath0 profiles with three gaussian components responsible for narrow ( photoionization precursor ) , broader narrow ( thin precursor ) , and broad ( postshock ) components , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_3gau ] . in this way",
    ", we find out broader - narrow components ( the blue data in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] ( a ) ) , whose error - weighted mean fwhm is 38.8@xmath30.4kms@xmath4 ( the blue data in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] ( b ) ) .",
    "for a balmer - dominated shock in the ne cygnus loop , we have found that the narrow h@xmath0 component abruptly broadens from 28.9@xmath30.7kms@xmath4 up to 38.8@xmath30.4kms@xmath4 ( after removing the contamination from a photoionization precursor ) within an extremely thin layer ( @xmath300.0013pc ) at the shock position . here",
    ", we assess the nature of this abrupt broadening .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , there are no promising postshock mechanisms ( including the conversion of ly@xmath31 @xmath32 h@xmath0 , momentum transfer in the process of excitation , elastic collisions between narrow component neutrals and shock heated protons , and molecular dissociation ) , leaving only preshock mechanisms . of these , there are two major possibilities : ( 1 ) a fast neutral precursor , in which fast neutrals returning from the postshock heat the preshock gas , and ( 2 ) a cr precursor described in section  1 .",
    "the fast neutral scenario was later disfavored by a simulation by @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the thickness of the neutral precursor becomes only @xmath110@xmath33 cm , which is smaller than the characteristic length ( @xmath13@xmath1810@xmath33 cm ) for cx between upstream protons and neutrals , violating a critical condition that at least one cx reaction must occur to generate warm neutrals ; upstream ( unshocked ) protons are first heated , and then these warm protons will become warm neutrals via cx with upstream cold neutrals .",
    "these characteristic lengths can be also checked by analytical solutions ( equations 15 and 17 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) combined with realistic physical parameters for the cygnus loop .",
    "in addition , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite also confirmed that the returning fast neutrals do not affect the width of the narrow h@xmath0 line for shock velocities @xmath301500kms@xmath4 like those in the cygnus loop .",
    "meanwhile , our measured upper limit of the precursor s length ( @xmath304@xmath2 cm ) does not enable us to eliminate ( nor support ) the possibility of the heating by returning fast neutrals .",
    "thus , precise determination of the precursor size with better spatial resolution is desired to clarify whether or not this idea is still viable .    as for the cr precursor scenario , there are two ways to broaden the line .",
    "one is doppler broadening due to alfvn or magneto sonic turbulence , and the other is the heating via damping of these turbulence . in any case , the affected ( warm ) protons need to become neutrals via cx with upstream cold neutrals .",
    "this condition sets a lower limit of the cr precursor size at the characteristic cx length scale of a few 10@xmath34 cm , which is met for the precursor of our interest ( @xmath35 cm ) .",
    "we now examine if the two waves can really grow in the thin cr precursors .",
    "the time scales for alfvn waves and sound waves to grow are @xmath36 @xcite @xmath37 @xcite , respectively , where @xmath38 is the alfvn velocity , @xmath39 is the length scale of the cr precursor , @xmath40 is the shock speed , @xmath41 is the cr acceleration efficiency , defined by a cr pressure over ram pressure , and @xmath42 is the sound velocity . on the other hand , the crossing time of the precursor is @xmath43 a simple comparison of the three time scales reveals that only alfvn waves can have sufficient time to grow .",
    "the turbulent velocity created by alfvn waves can be expressed as @xmath44 = @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the mean magnetic field and its fluctuation , respectively . given",
    "that @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath51 is the gyroradius of crs , we obtain @xmath52 thus , we can estimate @xmath53 if the magnetic field is amplified in the precursor , a somewhat larger turbulent velocity would be expected , as @xmath38 linearly depends on @xmath46 with @xmath54 being expected to stay at unity for strongly amplified magnetic fields .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that the precursor s length scale is inversely proportional to @xmath46 ( @xmath55 ) , and that the precursor s thickness must be larger than the characteristic length of cx ( 3@xmath1810@xmath34 cm ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field would not exceed a few 10 @xmath56 g , which results in an upper limit of the turbulent velocity of @xmath110 kms@xmath4 .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the velocity observed .",
    "therefore , we conclude that alfvn turbulence can not be the main contributor to the broadening of the narrow component . the heating by damping of alfvn waves was extensively investigated in light of observations of the cygnus loop by @xcite who revealed that the nonlinear landau damping can easily heat the upstream gas up to the temperature observed . in this model ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient is a key parameter to control the degree of heating . for the relevant precursor",
    ", we can estimate @xmath57 , at which we expect that @xmath58k according to fig .",
    "11 in @xcite .",
    "this is much higher than our measurement , @xmath593.5@xmath60k .",
    "this means that appropriate fine tuning of the model is required , which is beyond the scope of this @xmath61 .",
    "however , we can say that such an excessive heating is probably due to the fact that @xcite assumed that the shock is dominated by crs , which is unlikely the case for the cygnus loop , given the absence of synchrotron x - ray emission , the relatively soft gamma - ray spectrum , and the negligible pressure of nonthermal particles @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note an order of magnitude difference in the thickness of the cr precursors between the cygnus loop and tycho s knot g : @xmath62pc for the cygnus loop and @xmath630.01pc for tycho s knot g @xcite .",
    "combined with different shock speeds of @xmath64kms@xmath4 ( cygnus loop : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath65kms@xmath4 ( tycho s knot g : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an even larger difference is expected for the diffusion coefficient , @xmath49 . since @xmath50 is proportional to @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the energy of dominant accelerated particles ,",
    "we speculate that the remarkable difference in @xmath50 is caused by different energy distribution of accelerated particles between the two sources ; there is no doubt that crs in tycho s snr have higher energies than those in the cygnus loop , judging from the harder gamma - ray spectrum in tycho s snr than that in the cygnus loop @xcite .",
    "no firm conclusion can be reached yet , however , without information about the value of @xmath46 .",
    "whatever the nature , the difference of thin precursors sizes between the cygnus loop and tycho s knot g gives us a strong motivation to search for a positive correlation between the size of a thin precursor ( or diffusion coefficient ) and the hardness of cr energy distribution .",
