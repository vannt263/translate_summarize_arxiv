    "the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) will rank as one of the major scientific achievements of this century .",

    "our understanding of space - time and matter under the most extreme conditions will be transformed .",

    "the gw emission that drives the system s orbital decay is in agreement with the predictions of general relativity to better than 1% @xcite .",
    "when such binary neutron star ( bns ) systems eventually coalesce , they are predicted to emit copious amounts of gws @xcite .",
    "these sources will be prime targets for the new generation of gw detectors , led by advanced ligo ( aligo ; * ? ? ? * ) which is set to begin observing during the second half of 2015 and advanced virgo a year later @xcite . at final sensitivity",
    ", these advanced detectors are expected to detect bns mergers at a rate within the range 0.4400 yr@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "compact binary coalescences ( cbcs ) consisting of at least one black hole ( bh ) are also targets for gw detectors ; although there is compelling evidence for their existence @xcite , the event rates of these sources for aligo detection is not well known .",
    "one realisation in the last decade is that coalescing systems of ns / ns or ns / bh events could be the progenitors of short - hard gamma ray bursts ( sgrbs ) ; transient events routinely observed throughout the electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum @xcite .",
    "there exist other types of em , neutrino and cosmic ray emissions that may also be associated with gw events .",
    "these include long - duration gamma ray bursts ( lgrbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , short gamma ray repeaters @xcite , supernovae @xcite , fast radio bursts @xcite as well as others .",
    "history has already shown that multi - wavelength astronomy can play an important role in unveiling new phenomena . in the last decade , x - ray , optical and radio follow - ups have all transformed and revealed new processes in our understanding of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) ; combining em observations with those in the gw domain will too provide new insight into the internal engines and mechanisms at play in a multitude of different sources .",
    "a new generation of sensitive , wide - field telescopes , advancements in time domain astronomy and upgrades to neutrino and cosmic ray detectors can provide a coordinated network for discovery .",
    "the possible simultaneous detection of photons , neutrinos or high energy particles with gws would be a landmark moment for astrophysics , initiating a new era of _ _ multi - messenger _",
    "_ astronomy , for the first time including gw .    maximising",
    "the potential offered by gw observations involves the development of a worldwide , multi - messenger network .",
    "australian facilities are ideally placed to foster scientific exchanges in this new era and agreements have already been established . to conduct em follow - up of gw triggers , memorandums of understanding ( mous ) have been signed between the ligo / virgo gw collaboration and a number of facilities either based in australia or with strong australian involvement ; these include : the anglo - australian telescope , the australian square kilometer array pathfinder ( askap ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , icecube @xcite , the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the skymapper @xcite , the gw optical transient observer ( goto ) and zadko @xcite optical telescopes .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the most probable multi - messenger observations from the advanced detector era ; those associated with grbs .",
    "whilst doing so , we consider the contribution that the australian facilities can make to the worldwide multi - messenger effort .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 describes gw astronomy .",
    "sections 3 and 4 introduce sgrbs and lgrbs and describe how co - ordinated gw and multiwavelength observations of these events can provide breakthrough science .",
    "section 5 acts as a primer for those unfamiliar with the concepts and terminologies of detection and data analysis often used in the gw domain ; this section is not designed to be exhaustive but to present some of the most important concepts in gw detection and data analysis .",
    "section 6 discusses the expected rates and detection ranges for gw sources .",
    "the next two sections describe two of the strategies that form the basis for coordinated gw and em observations in the gw era .",
    "section 7 discusses em triggered gw searches ; these could likely yield the first coincident gw - em event through archival gw data .",
    "section 8 discusses the em follow - up of gw triggers ; this strategy is highly challenging due to the large positional uncertainties of gw observations but the potential rewards for success are without doubt highly significant .",
    "section 10 discusses the australian facilities involved in the co - ordinated science programs with aligo / adv and we highlight the areas in which they could contribute in this new frontier .",
    "finally , in section 11 we discuss the role neutrino follow - up plays in gw detection .",
    "gravitational waves are produced by regions of space - time that are distorted by high velocity bulk motions of matter .",
    "the timescale of the motions determine the frequency of the gw emission ; ground based detectors will target systems with masses in the range 110@xmath1 @xmath2 , which emit in the 1  hz10  khz band .",
    "this frequency range , covering the audio band , has motivated the characterisation of interferometric gw astronomy as `` listening to the universe '' .",
    "instruments capable of achieving detections will begin observations in the second half of 2015 .",
    "advanced ligo , a pair of us based interferometric detectors at hanford and livingston ( usa * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will have its first observational science run ( o1 ) in late-2015 ; a year later it will be joined by the italian advanced virgo ( adv ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a second observing run ( o2 ) .",
    "the `` advanced '' network of interferometric gw detectors will eventually have 10 times the sensitivity of the first generation instruments .",
    "the increased sensitivity translates into a factor @xmath3 increase in observed volume , making detections expected rather than plausible .",
    "additional instruments are expected to eventually join the network .",
    "kagra , a japanese detector , is envisioned to begin operation in 2018 - 19 @xcite and ligo - india is expected to be operational from 2020 , reaching a design sensitivity at the same level as aligo by around 2022  @xcite .",
    "the gw observations made by these instruments will differ from most conventional em observations in several ways :    1 .",
    "gws are not scattered or obscured by intervening material like dust so provide a window into the densest regions of the universe .",
    "as gw detectors observe an amplitude rather than a flux , the measure of detectability follows an inverse relationship with distance rather than the conventional inverse square law .",
    "therefore , number counts of a homogeneous distribution of standard - candle sources increases with distance , @xmath4 , as , @xmath5 , rather than , @xmath6 ; 3 .   as gws couple weakly to the detectors ,",
    "even very local astronomical sources of gws have to be highly energetic emitters of gravitational radiation ; 4 .",
    "gw detectors are nearly omnidirectional , with a nearly @xmath7 steradian sensitivity to astrophysical events with a greater than average response over more than 40% of the sky .",
    "the first point implies that gw observations can allow us to view astrophysical phenomena inaccessible by other means .",
    "the gravitational window can therefore enable frontier explorations in the low to intermediate redshift universe ( @xmath8 ) of sources that are electromagnetically invisible for much , or all , of their lives .",
    "the second point means that a factor 2 improvement in the sensitivity of a gw detector results in a factor 8 increase in the volume of the universe being probed .",
    "the third point emphasises a detection bias for detecting the most highly energetic astrophysical events .",
    "the typical fluxes of gw sources are of order @xmath9 jy , far greater than equivalent fluxes typically observed in the radio domain ( @xmath10jy  jy ) .",
    "the final point means that gw detectors are naturally survey instruments over a wide band of frequencies ( 105000 hz ) .",
    "there are a number of types of em counterparts that may be associated with gw emissions @xcite .",
    "as some of these counterparts are quite speculative , this paper focuses on gw signals associated with grbs .",
    "other sources of simultaneous em and gw emission include supernovae as well as multiple emission mechanisms from nss ; for a review of the latter , see the accompanying article in this series @xcite .    in the next few sections we provide a summary of both sgrbs and lgrbs and the type of gw / em associations that could be targeted in the gw era .",
    "some of these predictions are based on solid foundations whilst some are more speculative . in considering the latter",
    ", we note that when a new window of observation has been opened in the past , the discoveries that transform our understanding of the universe have often been the least expected .",
    "+    gravitational waves from the merger of coalescing binary systems of ns / ns and ns / bhs are confidently predicted to have observable em counterparts .",
    "this expectation is a result of the connection between these events and sgrbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the evidence stems from a number of different channels .",
    "firstly , the dynamic timescales of discs predicted from the merger of cbcs are consistent with the durations of sgrbs .",
    "secondly , em follow - ups of sgrbs have never provided an associated supernova .",
    "thirdly , sgrb afterglows have been localised to galaxies harbouring older stellar populations with offsets of order tens of kpc from their galactic centers ; this is consistent with post - natal kick velocities of 100s of km s@xmath0 , and also with the fainter and shorter lived afterglows expected from an ambient interstellar medium at a large offset .",
    "finally , as is discussed in  [ kilonova ] , the discovery of a faint em transient called a _",
    "kilonova _ has provided the strongest observational evidence to date of the sgrb / cbc association .",
    "conclusive proof of the cbc / sgrb association will be provided through gw observations .",
    "coincident em and gw observations of sgrbs could also provide a fascinating insight to the dominant mechanisms at the heart of grbs .",
    "low - latency gw pipelines could enable multi - wavelength follow - up measurements of the prompt emission , constraining both the underlying central engines and the emission mechanisms at work .",
    "later - time multi - wavelength follow - ups can provide insight through extensive coverage of the sgrb afterglow .",
    "a number of em counterparts have been predicted to accompany the inspiral and merger of ns / ns and ns / bh systems . in figure [ fig_mm_scenarios ]",
    "we show the likely outcomes of these mergers and in the following sections we will briefly review the most likely em counterparts that could accompany cbcs .      during the final stages of the merger of a compact binary ,",
    "the system is expected to launch a highly relativistic jet that interacts with itself and the surrounding medium ( the fireball model for grbs ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "collisions of material moving at different velocities within the jet will lead to internal shocks , giving short - lived bursts of gamma - rays that we detect as the sgrb prompt emission . as the accretion timescale is expected to be @xmath112 seconds @xcite ,",
    "the grbs associated with compact binary mergers are typically shorter in duration than those associated with core - collapse supernovae ( explaining the observed distribution of grbs ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the division between these two populations is not easily identifiable from the prompt gamma - ray emission alone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a number of _",
    "fermi_-lat grbs have shown @xmath12gev emission ( even at redshifts as distant as @xmath13 ) .",
    "two bursts were observed with gamma - ray photons reaching energies up to 94gev ( grb 130427a ) and 62gev ( grb 131231a )  this supports the suggestion that the photon energies may extend higher than previously assumed @xcite .",
    "significantly , these discoveries have not been limited to lgrbs , with sgrbs also showing high energy photons and gev emission often continuing for 10 s of seconds beyond the initial burst . the fact that _",
    "fermi_-lat discovered a photon of energy 31gev during the prompt phase of grb 090510 @xcite is promising for co - ordinated observations between gw detectors and ground - based cherenkov telescope arrays @xcite operating at @xmath12 10 gev .",
    "additionally , sgrbs with time - extended emission have recently been cited as promising targets for cherenkov telescope arrays @xcite .",
    "one exciting possibility is the observation of prompt optical flashes .",
    "so far , these emissions have only been observed in lgrbs @xcite . an early optical emission correlated with the prompt gamma - rays could indicate a common origin related to the internal shocks @xcite .",
    "a number of studies have suggested that compact binary mergers could generate prompt coherent radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such mechanisms include excitation of the plasma surrounding a compact binary merger by gws @xcite , from a dynamically - generated magnetic field after the merger @xcite , or from the onset of the collision of the forward shock with the surrounding medium @xcite . however , the detectability of emission from these processes will be dependent upon the scattering by the surrounding environment @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , these studies suggest compact binary mergers are an interesting contender for the progenitors of fast radio bursts ( frbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are currently unknown .",
    "plateaus and flares in x - ray light curves following grbs are signatures of ongoing energy injection .",
    "this could be caused by late - time accretion onto a central black hole ( unlikely in the compact binary scenario ; see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or from ongoing energy injection from the spindown of a newly born neutron star .",
    "indeed , recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the merger of two nss could result in a supramassive ns ; a star with a mass greater than the non - rotating maximum mass but supported from further collapse through rotation @xcite .",
    "around 60% of x - ray afterglow light curves of sgrbs observed by the _ swift _",
    "satellite @xcite have shown plateaus lasting 10010000  s after the burst ; these have been attributed to electromagnetic spin - down emissions from protomagnetars @xcite formed via the merger of two neutron stars @xcite .",
    "observations of the plateau phase can also be used to constrain the ns equation of state , with gw observations of the inspiral phase significantly aiding this endeavour @xcite    if the post - merger remnant is an ns , early optical afterglow as bright as 17th magnitude in r band ( assuming a distance of @xmath14 mpc ; see  [ section_cbc_ranges ] ) could be produced from dissipation of a wide - beamed protomagnetar wind @xcite .",
    "this magnetar wind could launch ejecta at relativistic speeds which would interact with the surrounding medium and produce a bright broadband afterglow from synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "gravitational wave emission may also accompany an afterglow plateau if a millisecond magnetar is born from the collision .",
    "multiple mechanisms for generating such gws exist in nascent neutron stars , including secular bar modes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath15-modes @xcite , and magnetic - field induced stellar deformations @xcite .",
    "such emission could be observable by aligo out to @xmath16 mpc @xcite .",
    "in fact , the x - ray light curve itself can be used to constrain the total gw emission from these systems @xcite .",
    "some plateaus following sgrbs exhibit an extremely steep decay phase , commonly interpreted as the collapse of the nascent neutron star to a black hole @xcite .",
    "such collapse could potentially produce an frb when the magnetic field lines snap as they cross the bh horizon @xcite , which is expected to occur @xmath17 s after the merger @xcite .",
    "a low latency gw trigger could enable prompt follow - ups to test this connection @xcite .      as the relativistic jet propagates",
    ", it collides with the medium surrounding the progenitor resulting in a forward shock travelling into the surrounding medium , and a reverse shock propagating back up the jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these shock fronts produce multi - wavelength synchrotron emission , initially peaking in the x - ray and moving through the different wavelengths to radio as it fades .",
    "the typical afterglow of grbs is attributed to the forward shock emission and the brightness of this afterglow is dependent upon a number of parameters , including the density of the surrounding medium .",
    "therefore , in a low density environment , the forward shock component is expected to be relatively faint .",
    "the multi - wavelength afterglows of sgrbs have been observed and are typically fainter than those of lgrbs @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with sgrbs being less energetic than lgrbs and with their locations in lower density environments .",
    "the reverse shock has also been observed for sgrb 051221a ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a ` kilonova ' is been predicted to form after the merger of two nss .",
    "this faint optical transient is powered by the radioactive decay of the ejected neutron rich matter @xcite and could reach around 21-23 mag in the optical and 21-24 mag in the nir for a source at 200 mpc @xcite .",
    "recent optical and near - infrared follow - up observations of grb 130603b have provided the most conclusive evidence to date of this scenario , reinforcing the theory that compact object mergers are the progenitors of sgrbs @xcite .",
    "these observations have added significantly to other observational evidence in support of this scenario @xcite .",
    "coincident em and gw observations could confirm that sgrbs are indeed the result of coalescing compact binaries .",
    "an additional prompt em emission related to the kilonova mechanism has also recently been suggested by @xcite .",
    "this has been inspired by studies that suggest a small fraction of the ejected neutron rich matter can expand rapidly enough to avoid r - process capture @xcite .",
    "the suggestion is that @xmath18-decay from free neutrons in the outermost layers of this ejecta could power optical emission on a timescale of hours after the merger , peaking at around magnitude 22 in the u - band for a source . for a source at 200 mpc",
    "this signal would peak at around magnitude 22 in the u - band and would act as a precursor to a kilonova .",
    "lgrbs are amongst the most luminous transient events in the universe in terms of em radiation per unit solid angle .",
    "these beamed emissions have been observed to last up to @xmath19 s @xcite and can radiate a total energy equivalent to that of the sun in its entire 10 gyr lifetime .",
    "the extreme luminosities allow lgrbs to be seen out to cosmological volumes , making them a probe of the high redshift universe ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the favoured scenario for these bursts is described by the collapsar model @xcite in which the inner part of a wolf - rayet star progenitor collapses to form a rapidly rotating black hole .",
    "high angular momentum enables the infalling matter to form an accretion disk , which in turn provides the energy reservoir to power an ultra - relativistic jet that blasts its way through the stellar envelope .",
    "the observed radiation is explained through synchrotron and/or inverse compton emission from the accelerated electrons in internal and external shocks .",
    "some authors have suggested instead that the central engines may consist of magnetars @xcite .",
    "there is observational evidence to support this scenario for at least a proportion of lgrbs @xcite .",
    "the connection between lgrbs with the collapse of massive stars @xcite has been supported by afterglow observations in or near dense regions of active star - formation ; predominantly dwarf starburst field galaxies @xcite . as mentioned earlier",
    ", their denser environments , as well as their higher emission energies , mean that the multiwavelength afterglows of lgrbs are typically brighter than those that occur from sgrbs @xcite .    in terms of gw emissions from these events",
    ", a number of lgrbs have been associated with core - collapse supernova @xcite . modelling",
    "the gw emission from these supernovae is very complex , requiring a combination of general relativistic hydrodynamics , magnetic fields , rotation , neutrino transport and nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "simulations have so far provided a picture of a very complex and chaotic behavior that includes shock formation and turbulence that create highly complex waveforms with multiple sharp bursts over ms durations . however , most scenarios suggest an event may have to be within tens of kpc for detection . as most lgrbs occur at cosmological distances , the vast majority of their gw signals will be out of reach for advanced detectors .    the requirement for rapid rotation to produce the disc in a grb @xcite allows for alternative emission mechanisms that could produce detectable gws out to 10s of mpc @xcite .",
    "fragmentation instabilities could be produced in the core or in the disc @xcite .",
    "rapid rotation could also give rise to rotational instabilities in the protoneutron star remnant @xcite    a number of studies have suggested there exists a sub - population of lgrbs known as low - luminosity grbs ( _ _ ll__grbs ) .",
    "these events have isotropic equivalent gamma - ray luminosities 2 - 3 orders of magnitude below classical lgrbs @xcite and have only been detected at low-@xmath21 due to their lower energy emissions ( the closest was grb980425 at z = 0.0085 or 36mpc ) .",
    "as such their rates have been predicted to be 23 orders of magnitude greater than lgrbs .",
    "observations have confirmed that both lgrbs and _ _ ll__grbs produce supernovae , suggesting that the _ _ ll__grbs may just be lower - energy events from the tail of the distribution .",
    "this has been a long going debate and attempts to address it have used statistical arguments @xcite , fits to the peak flux distribution @xcite , and simulation @xcite . the suggestion that _ _",
    "ll__grbs could be just normal lgrbs viewed off - axis was discounted based on statistical arguments , as it would produce a far higher local rate density than expected from lgrbs and would require narrower opening angles for lgrbs than determined from the breaks in afterglow lightcurves @xcite .    recently , an analysis of _ _ ll__grb 060218 has suggested that the main difference in the two bursts arises from an extended low - mass envelope in _ _",
    "the existence of such an envelope can smother the jet and drive a mildly relativistic shock resulting in a much lower luminosity than that produced by an ultra - relativistic jet that is able to penetrate through the bare progenitor star .",
    "interestingly , the statistical arguments suggesting separate populations put forward by @xcite can also support these two different scenarios .",
    "it is therefore possible that gw emission mechanisms could be driven by the same type of engine for both these classes .",
    "the output from a single gw detector consists of a time series data stream , @xmath22 , composed of the detector response to a gw signal , @xmath23 , and the detector noise @xmath24 : @xmath25 in general , @xmath23 will be a linear combination of the two orthogonal transverse polarizations , @xmath26 , weighted by the dimensionless detector antenna pattern functions for the two polarizations @xmath27 : @xmath28 which describe the detector sensitivity to radiation of different polarizations , incident from different directions @xcite .",
    "the angles , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , represent the direction to the source and @xmath31 is the polarization angle of the wave .",
    "a gw detector can follow the phase of a gw signal , so the time series is generally represented in the frequency domain by the strain amplitude spectral density , @xmath32 .",
    "this quantity is defined through the power spectral density @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the fourier transform of the time series .",
    "similarly , one can define a signal power spectral density , @xmath35 , and a noise power spectral density , @xmath36 .",
    "the strain amplitude spectral density is given by : @xmath37 with dimensions of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this quantity is often used in plots to display the sensitivity of gw interferometers .",
    "a single gw detector can not determine the polarization state or source direction of a transient signal .",
    "to obtain source localization , a widely separated network of gw detectors is essential .",
    "such a network may employ techniques such as _ coincidence analysis _ , in which individual events from different detectors are correlated in time @xcite , or _ coherent analysis _ , in which synchronized detector outputs are merged before searching for a common pattern @xcite . by effectively resolving the different times of arrival of gw events between members of a network ,",
    "coherent network analysis enables a detector array to become an all - sky monitor with good angular resolution over all source directions .    achieving good directional sensitivity",
    "is of paramount importance for gw / em associations . for the sources considered in this review , directional sensitivity is determined through triangulation of arrival times . to maximize the time delays , and hence improve directionality ,",
    "it is advantageous that a network be as geographically widely separated as possible @xcite and as such , a number of detectors are planned to join the aligo / adv network throughout the next decade .",
    "the japanese observatory kagra , should begin operations by around 2018 - 19 @xcite ; at design sensitivity this detector could improve the directional precision of a aligo / adv network by a factor of 1.5 - 2 and the detection rate by a similar factor @xcite .",
    "ligo - india operating at aligo sensitivity will be added to the aligo / adv network by 2022  by then bnss will be detectable out to @xmath39200 mpc and up to 400 events are possible per year @xcite .",
    "an indian detector will improve the angular resolution sufficiently to increase the percentage of gw sources detected within 5 deg@xmath40 from 3 - 7% to 17% @xcite .",
    "it has long been recognized that a gw detector in australia would add the longest baseline to the proposed advanced detector network ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , adding an australian detector to an aligo / adv three detector network can reduce the error in solid angle to tens of arc - minutes for high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) signals @xcite , dramatically improving the ability to localise gw sources for multi - wavelength follow - up observations .",
    "this scenario could be realised when third generation observatories such as the ` einstein gravitational wave telescope ' ( et ) become a reality in the next decade @xcite .",
    "the optimal site for a detector in the southern hemisphere been shown to be western australia @xcite , the current home to an 80-m baseline prototype gw detector .",
    "the false alarm rate ( far ) is the rate that false positives appear above a given snr threshold , and is dependent on the number of glitches ( non - stationary transients ) in the gw data stream .",
    "it is a critical measure as it determines whether a candidate should be considered for follow - up . for well modeled sources ,",
    "the background of false alarms is at a level close to that of gaussian noise . for un - modeled sources",
    " typically short duration transients  the data quality has a greater effect on detection confidence . one therefore sets the threshold high enough so that noise generated false alarms are negligible .",
    "given that the probability , @xmath41 , of observing an event with an amplitude in the range @xmath42 to @xmath43 is given by a gaussian distribution of standard deviation @xmath44 , the probability of obtaining a far greater than a given threshold , @xmath45 , is : @xmath46    to be 99% confident that a gw has been detected , one can set an snr @xmath47 which is equivalent to a far of 1 in 100 years of observation . to see this",
    "one can approximate number of noise instances during that period .",
    "if the detector output sampling rate is 1 khz and the output is processed through @xmath48 filters , in 100 years we get @xmath49 , yielding @xmath50 which is our required snr . for a network of three equivalent detectors combined snr ,",

    "the expected gw signals from cbcs takes on the well modelled chirp form shown in figure [ fig_chirp ] .",
    "the figure shows how the signal increases in both amplitude and frequency towards merger ; as it does so it sweeps across the sensitive bandwidth of advanced gw interferometric detectors .    for such well - modeled signals , the most efficient signal detection method to extract signals from noisy detector data",
    "is _ matched filtering _ , in which a _ template _ , representing the predicted waveform as a function of time is correlated with the output of a detector @xcite .",
    "a matched signal will produce an output much greater than that expected for pure noise with an optimal snr given as : @xmath56^{1/2}. \\label{eq : snr}\\ ] ] for well - modelled sources , matched filtering enhances the value of the signal by a factor @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the number of cycles used in the integration . as inspiralling systems approach merger , even though the rest frame gw amplitude will increase , the number of cycles in each frequency bin , @xmath59 , gets smaller ; therefore the detected signal will decrease .",
    "this means that for inspiraling systems , rather than solely base the predicted amplitude of the radiation as a true indicator of the detectability , we include a measure of the observed cycles .",
    "the value of @xmath58 increases with the compactness of the system as it approaches merger and if observed from a frequency of 10 hz until merger , could produce @xmath60 cycles  effectively improving the detectability by a factor of 100 .",
    "however , to achieve such gains , a gw data - stream would have to be filtered by a large number of templates ( of order @xmath61 in near real time ",
    "the significant challenges in both theoretical modeling and computational efficiency to achieve this can not be underestimated .",
    "one important aspect of well - modeled inspiralling systems is that a detection can be made 10s of seconds before the merger if enough cycles can be detected to boost the snr @xcite .",
    "figure 2 illustrates this concept showing a chirp signal 40s before the merger phase .",
    "this scenario could allow a low - latency alert to be sent out to em facilities as near real - time as possible to catch a prompt em signature ; the combination of em and gw data in this regime would provide valuable insight into the inner workings of such cataclysmic events .",
    "it is also worth noting that gws can provide an independent measure of luminosity distance , @xmath62 @xcite . during the inspiral phase , the gw strain , and the rate of change of gw frequency",
    "are given as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the redshifted chirp mass , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , @xmath67 are the component masses of the binary .",
    "therefore , if one can determine the redshift through , for example , a galaxy association , one can measure the redshift - luminosity distance relation independent of the cosmic distance ladder .",
    "a recent series of papers has reinvigorated this topic by introducing novel methods for breaking the redshift - chirp mass degeneracy with future gw observations @xcite .",
    "although matched filtering is the optimal strategy for gaussian , stationary noise , high amplitude transients due to instrumental and environmental artifacts can render gw data to be non - stationary and non - gaussian . therefore , one must employ robust methods that can reject instrumental artifacts and retain the true gw events .",
    "one such method is the @xmath68 veto that is a powerful consistency test used to reject false alarms @xcite .",
    "this method uses the fact that the quantity @xmath45 is an integral over all frequencies and therefore not sensitive to the contributions from different frequency regions of the broadband signal .",
    "one can split the signal spectrum into @xmath58 bins of equal snr contribution , and draw a comparison with the expected value in each bin ( based on the model template ) .",
    "a true gw event will have power accumulated approximately equally in each of @xmath58 bins ; a noise glitch will have power unevenly distributed and will yield a large @xmath68 value .",
