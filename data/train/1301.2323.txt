    "the fornax galaxy cluster is the second nearest cluster of galaxies after virgo , with a distance modulus of @xmath6 @xcite corresponding to a distance of 20.0 mpc .",
    "it consists of two major components of the main fornax cluster centered on ngc 1399 and a subcluster dominated by ngc 1316 @xcite .",
    "there have been many photometric and spectroscopic studies of globular cluster ( gc ) systems in the central region of the fornax cluster , and a fair number of them concentrated on the gc system associated with ngc 1399 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented the first ccd photometry for ngc 1399 gcs .",
    "both studies presented an unusually high gc specific frequency of @xmath7 ( i.e. , number of gcs normalized to the galaxy luminosity ; see @xcite ) .",
    "although subsequent studies ( @xcite ) derived a lower value ( @xmath8 ) , it is still higher than those of normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggested that ngc 1404 gcs may have been tidally stripped by ngc 1399 , resulting in a high @xmath9 value of ngc 1399 and a lower @xmath9 value of ngc 1404 .",
    "@xcite also proposed that the over abundance of ngc 1399 gcs can be explained by tidal stripping of gcs from neighboring galaxies and by the accretion of gcs in the gravitational potential of the fornax cluster .",
    "@xcite supported this idea by showing that gcs in ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 are statistically indistinguishable in terms of their color distributions and luminosity functions in their @xmath10 photometry .",

    "@xcite presented the asymmetries in the azimuthal distribution of ngc 1399 gcs and suggested that they may be explained by the tidal stripping of gcs from ngc 1387 .",
    "since @xcite first suggested a possible bimodal @xmath11 color distribution in the gc system of ngc 1399 , many studies have confirmed the bimodal or multimodal gc color distribution in this galaxy through various passbands ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "we then cross - identified the gcs with our point - source objects , and found that most of them lie inside the tight sequence ( orange dots in figure  [ fig6_twocol ] ) .",

    "we focus particularly on three main parameters of the gmm analysis that characterize the bimodal distributions ; the number ratio between blue and red gcs , the mean colors of the groups , and their color dispersions .",
    "figure  [ fig15_n1399r ] shows the variations of color bimodality properties as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "there is an obvious radial trend for the mean colors of both blue and red gcs getting bluer with increasing radius in all colors .",
    "the radial color gradient of red gcs is steeper than that of blue gcs .",
    "the red gc fraction in each color rapidly decreases with increasing galactocentric radius out to @xmath80 @xmath61 @xmath81 , and it remains fairly constant beyond the point .",
    "there is a weak radial trend in gc color dispersions , in that the ratio between dispersions of blue and red gcs increases with radius .",
    "we have performed wide - field @xmath30 photometry of gcs in the central region of the fornax cluster of galaxies with the mosaic ii ccd imager on the 4 m blanco telescope at ctio .",
    "this is one of the widest and deepest @xmath0-band studies on extragalactic gc systems .",
    "the reduction was carried out with the daophot ii / allframe package . using two - color diagrams and the magnitude cut of @xmath82 , a total of 2037 gc candidates",
    "were selected among 12,134 objects detected in all four bands .",
    "our estimate of the contamination by background galaxies and foreground stars in our sample is in the range of 9%16% .",
    "the sample is @xmath0-band limited , and the completeness of our photometry is 50% at @xmath83 according to our artificial star tests .",
    "we provide the @xmath30 photometric catalog of the gc candidates online . for the gc systems of ngc 1399 ,",
    "ngc 1404 , and ngc 1387 , we have investigated the spatial distributions , cmds , and color distributions . for ngc",
    "1399 gcs , the radial variations in the properties of bimodality were examined as well .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we find an asymmetric distribution of gc candidates around ngc 1399 .",
    "the overabundance of gcs at the southeast side of the inner region and toward the directions of ngc 1404 and ngc 1387 in the outer region suggests that there were recent interactions of ngc 1399 with the galaxies and that ngc 1399 is not yet dynamically relaxed .",
    "we specify the radial extent of each gc system at the radius where the surface density profile begins to depart from the de vaucouleurs fit .",
    "the limiting radii are @xmath534 for ngc 1404 and @xmath537 for ngc 1387 .",
    "the gc system of ngc 1399 is spatially extended beyond the field of view of our observation .",
    "we show that the gc systems in the three galaxies exhibit bimodal color distributions in all the colors considered in this study . for the brightest gcs in ngc 1399 ,",
    "the bimodality becomes weak or disappear depending on colors .",
    "we find with gmm that the morphology of the color histograms changes significantly , depending on the colors used .",
    "the color dispersion of red gcs is larger than that of blue gcs in @xmath0-band colors by more than a factor of two , while the red and blue gcs show similar dispersions in @xmath44 and @xmath65 .",
    "the number ratios between blue and red gcs vary depending on colors used as well .",
    "when corrected for the contribution of ngc 1399 gcs , the red gc fractions of ngc 1404 and ngc 1387 remain constant regardless of the colors used .",
    "we suggest a possible scenario that could explain the presence of two discrete gc populations in ngc 1404 and ngc 1387 : ( 1 ) the central , red gcs have been preferentially left through the early interactions of the galaxies with ngc 1399 and ( 2 ) later blue gcs have been accreted from outer region of ngc 1399 .",
    "we confirmed that the mean colors of blue and red gcs in ngc 1399 show a radial trend of becoming bluer with increasing galactocentric radius .",
    "the gradient of red gcs is steeper than that of blue gcs .",
