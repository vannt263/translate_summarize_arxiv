    "in paturel et al . ( 1996 ) , we presented our program of collecting the main astrophysical parameters for the principal galaxies .",
    "the first target was limited to adding information on galaxies already known in the leda database .",
    "the work is now more ambitious because we are aiming at detecting new galaxies from the _ deep near infrared survey of the southern sky _ ( hereafter denis ) .",
    "denis is a program to survey the entire southern sky in three wavelength bands ( gunn - i : 0.80@xmath2 , j : 1.25@xmath2 and ks : 2.15@xmath2 ) with limiting magnitudes of 18.5 , 16.5 and 14.0 respectively .",
    "the observations are performed with the eso 1m - telescope at la silla ( chile ) with a dedicated camera .",
    "the survey observations with three channels started in routine mode in december 1995 .",
    "a detailed description of denis is given in epchtein ( 1998 ) and in garzn et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    the systematic detection , extraction and cataloging of denis extragalactic sources are of significant interest for studies requiring large and homogeneous samples such as the kinematics of the local universe , the distance scale , cosmology etc ... the i - band is the most suitable both for the detection of extended objects and for the star / galaxy separation , except in the galactic plane .",
    "thus , in the present study only the i - band images are considered .",
    "the transfer of denis images from paris to lyon is explained in section 2 and the extraction of objects from these images in section 3 . in sections 4 to 5",
    "we describe astrometry and automatic galaxy recognition and analysis .",
    "then , in sections 6 to 8 , we explain how galaxies are cross - identified with leda galaxies leading to the comparison of astrophysical parameters with those from mathewson et al . and from leda .",
    "finally , in section 9 we describe the provisional i - band denis catalog .",
    "it is important to note that a deeper catalog will be made at the end of the survey .",
    "hence , the present catalog is a preliminary catalog of bright galaxiesdetected by denis , and used to start a radio and spectrographic follow - up long before the end of the survey .",
    "the present measurements cover one year of observation .",
    "the i - band of the survey is the _ gunn - i _ band at @xmath3 .",
    "the ccd camera is a tektronix 1024@xmath41024 pixel array cooled down to liquid nitrogen temperature .",
    "each frame ( 768@xmath4768 pixels ) represents @xmath5 square arcminutes with a pixel size of @xmath6 arcsecond .",
    "the integration time is @xmath7 seconds .",
    "the read - out noise is about @xmath8 .",
    "the observing strategy consists in scanning at a constant right ascension on strips of @xmath9 degrees in declination ( 180 frames per strip ) taken in three zones `` equatorial '' from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , `` intermediate '' from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and `` polar '' from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "the overlap between adjacent frames is @xmath6 arcminute on each side ( i.e. @xmath16 arcminute in each direction ) .",
    "this strategy aims at covering a wide range of airmasses .",
    "each strip starts and ends with photometric and astrometric calibrations . at the end of some nights",
    "a flat fielding is performed directly on the sky during sunrise .",
    "the data is archived on dat cartridges which are send each week to the _",
    "paris data analysis center _ ( pdac ) at the institut dastrophysique de paris for processing .      a systematic automatic processing of denis i - images began in lyon in february 1996 .",
    "flat - fielding and de - biasing are made at pdac on each genuine frame .",
    "for the lyons processing each i - image is reduced by a factor 4 in size by rebinning pixels 2@xmath42 .",
    "our effective pixel size is thus @xmath16 arcseconds .",
    "an example of an i - frame is given in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the histogram of pixel intensities is used to calculate the sky background intensity @xmath17 .",
    "the sky - background level is taken at the maximum intensity of the histogram ( i.e. the mode ) and the standard deviation @xmath18 is calculated by symmetrizing the low intensity part of the histogram with respect to the mode .",
    "the sources are concentrated in the high intensity part of the histogram .",
    "a threshold is then applied ( the threshold level is @xmath19 ) .",
    "using this procedure ( averaging and thresholding ) allows a compression factor of 20 to 30 , depending on the image contents .",
    "all images of a given i - strip are thus compressed , tard and automatically transferred to lyon via ftp .",
    "a full strip is stored in 10 to 13 mbytes .",
    "the galaxy extraction is made at lyon using the program described in the following section .",
    "all sources ( stars , galaxies , defects etc ... ) are extracted using the same algorithm as described in paturel et al . ( 1996 , section 3.1 ) , except that no attempt was made to share interacting objects which are simply flagged after visual inspection ( section 5 ) .",
    "the reason is that we are interested first of all in well defined objects . at the end of this stage , we obtain for each frame a collection of matrixes ( see an example in figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "matrixes smaller than 17 pixels are rejected .",
    "they correspond , to the mean , of objects of @xmath20 arcseconds in diameter .",
    "= 5.5 cm    astrophysical parameters are extracted for each matrix according to paturel et al .",
    "( 1996 , section 3.2 ) .",
    "these parameters are the following :    * weighted mean position of the center @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( in pixels ) , where the weight is the pixel intensity @xmath23 * major axis @xmath24 ( d in @xmath25 ) at faint isophotal level ( external diameter )",
    ". * axis ratio @xmath26 ( log of major to minor axis ) * position angle of the major axis @xmath27 ( in degrees , counted from north towards east ) * magnitude @xmath28 ( in arbitrary units ) , @xmath29 is the number of pixels with intensity @xmath23 larger than the threshold .",
    "we have now to perform astrometry ( conversion of pixels positions to right ascension and declination ) and then recognition of `` galaxies '' , `` stars '' , and `` unknown objects '' .",
    "the center of the frame is taken from the header of the fits file . from the guide star catalog ( gsc ) and from the leda database",
    "we extract all objects ( stars or galaxies ) known in the corresponding square .",
    "a cross - identification between matrixes and stars is made exactly as described in paturel et al .",
    "( 1996 , sections 3.3 and 3.4 ) .",
    "galaxies are also used but only when they have accurate coordinates ( i.e. typically better than @xmath30 arcsecond ) . a 6th order polynomial fit converts ( x , y ) positions on the frames to right ascension and declination .",
    "the number of gsc stars varies from one frame to another .",
    "a histogram of number of gsc stars per frame is given in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "if this number is smaller than 7 or if the standard deviation of the polynomial fit is greater than @xmath31 arcseconds , the solution is rejected and we adopt the header solution calculated from the coordinates of the center and the pixel size as given in the header .",
    "if the gsc - solution seems acceptable but differs from the header - solution by more than @xmath9 arcseconds , the header solution is preferred and coordinates are flagged to recall that they may be inaccurate .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in figure [ fig5 ] , we show the differences between the gsc - solution and the fits header - solution .",
    "most of them are in good agreement within @xmath32 arcseconds .",
    "note that more recent measurements have been astrometrically calibrated to better than 1 arcsecond by cross - identifying with the pmm database .",
    "= 8.5 cm    galaxy coordinates will be compared directly with coordinates of leda galaxies .",
    "a sample of 1146 objects has been visually classified into three classes : stars , galaxies and unknown objects .",
    "the distribution in each class is the following :    [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that the `` night number '' is a logical number , not a real night number .",
    "each time the system is initialized the night number is incremented .",
    "this explains that after one year of running survey there are 2500 logical nights .",
    "= 8.5 cm    an airmass correction is adopted using a typical value @xmath33 .",
    "a check is made to control that there is no airmass residual .",
    "the residual is smaller than 0.01 magnitude .",
    "the denis i - magnitude is then :    @xmath34    the zero - point distribution of @xmath35 is gaussian ( fig.[fig10 ] ) with a standard deviation of 0.2 magnitude . if we assume that the error is identical for both systems the mean error on denis extragalactic i - band magnitudes would be about 0.14 magnitude . because the uncertainty on mathewson et al .",
    "data is probably smaller , the uncertainty on our i - band magnitudes is about @xmath36 magnitude .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in fig.[fig11 ] , the comparison between @xmath37 and @xmath38 is shown for galaxies with secure identification and being neither `` multiple '' nor `` truncated '' .",
    "the direct regression is : @xmath39 with the following standard deviation , correlation coefficient and number of objects : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 after 11 rejections at @xmath43 .",
    "stricto sensu , the slope is not significantly different from 1 , and the zero - point is not significantly different from 0 .",
    "so , we are keeping the conservative solution : @xmath44 . among the 10 rejected galaxies ,",
    "8 can be explained by localized poor photometric conditions ( because they correspond to a loss of flux ) .",
    "the measurements of corresponding nights will be counted with half weight .",
    "two nights were rejected ( night 2475 and 2159 ) because they give rejections in the comparison of different photometric parameters .",
    "= 8.5 cm      diameters and axis ratios are also compared with those of mathewson et al .",
    "these comparisons are given in fig.[fig12 ] and fig.[fig13 ] , respectively .",
    "the direct regression are : @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 after 4 rejections at @xmath43 .    for the axis ratio , it is better to force the intercept",
    "to be zero as generally admitted ( see de vaucouleurs et al . , 1976 ) .",
    "this avoids to have negative axis ratio after the application of the regression .",
    "the result is thus :    @xmath49    with @xmath46 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 after 2 rejections at @xmath43 .",
    "none of these regressions is significantly different from the absolute identity .",
    "so , we will keep : @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the standard deviations are 0.10 for both @xmath24 and @xmath26 . again , if we assume the same error on both systems the error on @xmath24 and @xmath26 is about 0.07 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm",
    "the coordinates are compared with coordinates given in leda . only coordinates",
    "known as accurate in leda ( i.e.with a standard deviation less than @xmath30 arcseconds ) are used .",
    "the plot of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in figure [ fig14a ] shows that there is no systematic distorsion ( @xmath56 means @xmath57 ) .",
    "the standard deviation is @xmath58 arcseconds and @xmath59 arcseconds for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "assuming an error of the same amplitude in leda and denis coordinates gives an uncertainty of @xmath62 arcseconds for denis right ascension and declination , i.e. an uncertainty of @xmath63 arcseconds for the position of a galaxy .",
    "in fact , the plot of @xmath64 vs. @xmath54 exhibited two abnormal zones with a systematic shift of about 30 or 40 arcseconds .",
    "this problem appeared near the zenith .",
    "thus , only objects with coordinates based on the gsc stars are kept in the present version . in the final catalog",
    ", the coordinates will be obtained through a full astrometric solution ( mosaicing frames along each strip and with adjacent ones ) and this problem will be solved without rejecting galaxies .",
    "= 8.5 cm      position angle is important for studies on the orientation of galaxies , but also for identification .",
    "however , for nearly face on galaxies , it becomes very uncertain .",
    "the comparison is made only for galaxies with @xmath65 .",
    "the result is given in ( fig.[fig15 ] ) .",
    "the direct regression gives : @xmath66 with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 after 21 rejections at @xmath43 . among the 21 rejections ,",
    "only 2 correspond to real discrepancies .",
    "the uncertainty on the measurement of @xmath27 is @xmath70 .",
    "this excellent agreement of position angles validates the reliability of our cross - identification .",
    "= 8.5 cm      it is interesting to obtain at least a very crude estimate of the morphological type code .",
    "this is particularly important when we plan to start a hi follow - up for which it is compulsory to avoid elliptical galaxies .",
    "the log of the standard deviation of pixel intensities is significantly correlated with the morphological type code extracted from leda .",
    "the relation is almost linear .",
    "however , it appears that the solution depends on the size of the galaxy ( all very small objects appear identical ) .",
    "the slope and the intercept are found linearly correlated with the log of the number of pixels . in the scale between -5 and 10 defined in the second reference catalog of bright galaxies ,",
    "the photometric morphological type code is calculated as :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the standard deviation of flux of all pixels of the matrix representing the galaxy : @xmath73 with @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath29 is the number of pixels .",
    "the comparison of codes @xmath76 and @xmath77 is given in figure  [ fig16 ] .",
    "the correlation is clearly significant ( the correlation coefficient is @xmath78 ) but the standard deviation is large ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "this allows us to classify galaxies into early , intermediate and late types , with no finer subdivision . in the catalog , photometric morphological type smaller than @xmath80 or greater than @xmath30",
    "will be set to @xmath80 or @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the catalog of galaxies which is described here is the first of a series which will be released during the progression of the survey . at the end of the survey",
    "a deeper and complete catalog will be produced at pdac .",
    "the present one , is necessarily limited to the first observations ( one year ) .",
    "each galaxy is numbered with a provisional internal number ( red , for rapid extraction from denis ) , and an identifier from the leda database ( pgc / leda ) .",
    "galaxies are also identified with an alternate name taken in the following catalogues : ngc , ic ( dreyer , 1988 ) , ugc ( nilson , 1973 ) , eso ( lauberts , 1982 ) , mcg ( vorontsov - velyaminov et al .",

    "the weights used for calculating the weighted means are the inverse square of actual mean errors . for nights suspected to be of poor photometric quality the actual mean error",
    "is divided by 3 rejection rule , so one can admit that their mean error is three times the typical mean error . ] .",
    "further , when the quality of the matrix is uncertain ( peculiar , multiple or truncated ) , the weight is divided by 2 .",
    "this correcting coefficient is deduced from the comparison of i magnitudes with poor quality objects .",
