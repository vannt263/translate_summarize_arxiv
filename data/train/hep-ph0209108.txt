    ". then precision measurements are necessary to identify the specific supersymmetric scenario which is realized in nature and to determine the model parameters . due to the clear signatures and the feasibility of polarized beams linear colliders offer outstanding possibilites to find susy particles and to study their properties @xcite . here",
    "charginos , the supersymmetric partners of the charged gauge and higgs bosons , are of particular interest as they are expected to be light enough to be produced with comparably large cross sections at an @xmath4 collider . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the production process is determined by the susy parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and the sneutrino mass @xmath8 , whereas the chargino decay into the lightest neutralino @xmath9 which we assume to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) depends in addition on the gaugino mass parameter @xmath3 and the mass @xmath10 of the left selectron .",
    "the susy parameters can be determined with high precision in a combined analysis of neutralino and chargino pair production at an @xmath4 collider with polarized beams @xcite .    besides for the @xmath4 option",

    "we focus on the decay of the light positive chargino @xmath13 , but consider in the analytical formulae the complete spin correlations between the production and decay process .",
    "since the production is a pure qed process at tree level which depends only on the mass of the charginos the chargino decay mechanism can be studied separately in @xmath11 collisions . provided the chargino mass has been measured and the energy spectrum and polarization of the high energy photons are well under control the production cross section and the polarization of the charginos are known and can be varied by suitable choice of the polarization of the laser photons and the converted electron beam .",
    "then the direct measurement of the chargino decay branching ratios for the various decay channels may be useful for an analysis of the chargino system complementary to the @xmath4 mode where both production and decay are sensitive to the susy parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .  2 we present the general spin density matrix formalism for the production of fermions with polarized photon beams and their subsequent decay . in order to analyze the influence of the fermion polarization on the forward - backward asymmetry of the decay product one needs the spin density production matrix which is given analytically in the @xmath11-cms for circularly polarized photons in sect .",
