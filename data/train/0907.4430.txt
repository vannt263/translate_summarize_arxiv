    "among the available methods to investigate the properties of strongly interacting many  body quantum systems , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) ones hold a relevant position since some of the qmc methods can provide `` exact '' expectation values . as for all the monte",
    "carlo methods , qmc results are affected by statistical uncertainties , but the property that makes some of them `` exact '' is the possibility of reducing within this unavoidable errors all the systematic errors introduced by the involved approximations . this is true for boson system at zero and at finite temperature , but the studies of fermion systems , excited states or real time dynamics all suffer from sign problems which still have precluded the development of such kind of `` exact '' methods .",
    "a first great subdivision of `` exact '' qmc methods is between finite and zero temperature methods . among @xmath1 k methods we find green function monte carlo ( gfmc),@xcite diffusion monte carlo ( dmc),@xcite path integral ground state monte carlo ( pigs)@xcite and reptation monte carlo ( rmc).@xcite at finite temperature , the major role is played by path",
    "integral monte carlo ( pimc).@xcite    the main difference between finite and zero temperature methods is that ground state methods rely , to different extents , on a trial wave function for the importance sampling , while in pimc no such wave function is involved at all .",
    "pimc needs only information on the interaction among particles as input , and the main difficulty to overcome , beyond the propagator accuracy , is the sampling ergodicity .",
    "recently a great step forward in this direction has been realized with the advent of the worm algorithm.@xcite the first gfmc computation did not use importance sampling,@xcite but this computation was for a small system of 32 particles .",
    "all the other computation at zero temperature have used a model wave function that was given as input . with respect to pigs method ,",
    "if , in principle , convergence can be achieved for any initial wave function that has a finite overlap with the ground state , the question is if convergence can be achieved in a real computation .",
    "some progress have been achieved recently both for a finite@xcite and for a bulk boson system.@xcite for example , a jastrow wave function , that describes the bulk phase of a quantum liquid , was employed as initial wave function in the study of small parahydrogen clusters.@xcite in the case of a two dimensional crystal of @xmath0he , convergence to the same result was found in the computation of the one  body density matrix starting from two initial wave functions with `` opposite '' properties,@xcite one with bose ",
    "einstein condensate and the other without .",
    "stimulated by these results , we have undergone a systematic check for a realistic hamiltonian for @xmath0he and we have found that pigs methods converge to the exact result regardless of the chosen initial wave function .",
    "even better , pigs converges even if the wave function contains wrong correlations or no correlations at all .    as a test  bed",
    "we have considered the bulk liquid and solid phases of a strongly interacting boson system such as @xmath0he . by projecting very different wave functions",
    ", we find converging results for diagonal properties like the energy , the radial distribution function , the static structure factor and also for off - diagonal properties like the one - body density matrix . for both the liquid and the solid phases we consider a shadow wave function ( swf),@xcite which is the best available variational wave function@xcite for @xmath0he systems , and the constant wave function ( cwf ) , which is the ground state wave function of the ideal bose gas and does not contain any correlation . the latter corresponds to have no importance sampling since the initial wave function gives the same weight to any configuration of the particles .",
    "furthermore , for the liquid phase , we have considered also a localized wave function which describes an einstein solid .",
    "our question is whether pigs is able to recover the exact ground state starting from really different systems , i.e. an ideal gas or an einstein crystal for the quantum liquid and an ideal gas for the quantum solid .",
    "we find that for all the considered initial wave functions pigs converges to the exact ground state .",
    "only the convergence rate depends on the initial wave function , and turns out to be slower for the worse ones .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : meth ] deals with the description of the pigs method , of the test bed systems and of the initial wave functions .",
    "results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "[ sec : conc ] contains our conclusions .",
    "it is well known that , given a hamiltonian @xmath2 for a quantum system of @xmath3 particles , the ground state wave function @xmath4 in the position representation can be obtained as the @xmath5 limit of an imaginary time ( @xmath6 ) evolution of an initial ( trial ) wave function @xmath7 , provided that @xmath8 : @xmath9 regardless of a normalization constant , which is not involved in the monte carlo sampling and thus will be dropped in the following , an accurate approximation of the ground state wave function is given by @xmath10 this originates from the action of the imaginary time projector @xmath11 , which exponentially removes from @xmath7 any overlap with the excited states during the imaginary time evolution .",
    "the evolved wave function @xmath12 and eq .",
    "provide the basis for all the zero temperature qmc methods .",
    "a first problem rises : the imaginary time propagator @xmath13 can be accurately written only for small values of @xmath14 , but a large @xmath14 limit is necessary to ensure the convergence to @xmath4 . one possible strategy to overcome this problem is to reach the large @xmath14 limit by means of a recursive procedure , as for example in gfmc@xcite and dmc.@xcite both these methods reach an extremely accurate approximation of the ground state wave function multiplied by @xmath7 by iterating equation by means of random walks .",
    "with these methods the trial wave function has a strategical role since it is involved at each iteration step , where it is used as importance sampling function .    on the contrary , the pigs method@xcite interprets the imaginary time propagator as a density matrix operator corresponding to an inverse temperature @xmath15 , and",
    "then , by exploiting the factorization property @xmath16 the large @xmath14 propagator @xmath13 is written as a convolution of small imaginary time propagators @xmath17 as in standard path integral formalism.@xcite thus the density matrix operator is broken up into @xmath18 small pieces with a time step @xmath19 and the approximated ground state wave function reads @xmath20 an appealing feature , peculiar of this method is that , in @xmath12 , the ansatz on @xmath7 acts only at the starting point being the full imaginary time path governed by @xmath13 , which depends only on @xmath2 .",
    "once fixed @xmath21 , the elementary evolution step in imaginary time is obtained acting with @xmath17 on a quantum state ; this action is usually called projection step due to the resulting increased overlap with the ground state . the pigs method reaches convergence to the ground state when adding further imaginary time projections to @xmath12 does not provide any appreciable change of the results , i.e. the expectation values computed with @xmath22 is compatible with those computed with @xmath12 within the statistical errors for any integer @xmath23 . since the convergence on the ground state for a finite system is exponentially fast,@xcite the number @xmath18 of required imaginary time projections is usually limited .",
    "nevertheless @xmath18 depends on the specific expectation value one is computing , thus a separate analysis of the convergence should be carried on for every computed quantity .",
    "the convergence rate is determined essentially by the quality of the initial wave function .",
    "the total imaginary time @xmath14 required to clean the initial wave function up from excited state contributions is smaller for good ( i.e. with large overlap with the ground state ) initial wave functions .",
    "also the accuracy of the approximation used for the small time @xmath13 has a role in determining the computational cost of the projection procedure : in fact , with better approximations of the small imaginary time @xmath13 , one needs a smaller number of projection steps to reach convergence since larger time step @xmath21 are allowed .",
    "moreover the imaginary time projection procedure should be able , in principle , to incorporate in the final wave function all the correct correlations , even if these were absent in @xmath7 .",
    "thus it should be possible , in principle , to obtain the correct ground state wave function , if @xmath14 is large enough , even if @xmath7 is extremely poor , and the results do not suffer from any variational bias . the intent of the present study is to show that this is indeed the case with values of @xmath14 manageable with present computational resources .    like for finite temperature pimc,@xcite also within pigs",
    "the quantum system is mapped into a system of classical polymers , but in this case the polymers start and end on the initial wave function @xmath7,@xcite resulting in open linear polymers instead of the close ring ones of pimc.@xcite each open polymer represents the full imaginary time path of a quantum particle that is sampled by means of the metropolis algorithm .",
    "thus , the entire imaginary time evolution of the system is sampled at each monte carlo step , contrary to what happens for dmc , for example .",
    "expectation values of an operator @xmath24 reads @xmath25 and , if @xmath14 is large enough to allow convergence to the ground state , @xmath26 is the ground state expectation value , without needing any extrapolation .",
    "however an analysis of the convergence as a function of @xmath14 is needed , as explained before .",
    "the ground state expectation value of the energy can be obtained in several ways : the most largely employed one is the mixed estimate @xmath27 notice that in pigs this mixed estimate is exact . in fact , since the hamiltonian operator @xmath2 commutes with the imaginary time evolution operator @xmath13 , it is possible to obtain unbiased expectation value of the hamiltonian inserting @xmath2 at one of the ends of the path . if @xmath7 is an accurate wave function , this estimator is preferable with respect to the direct one given by eq .   with @xmath28 , because it has typically a lower variance .",
    "this is no more true , however , when the initial wave function is particularly poor . in this case",
    "the fluctuations in the expectation value of the hamiltonian become so sizable that is unusable .",
    "the direct estimator is seldom used because one has to compute the first and the second derivative of @xmath17 ; but this is not a serious problem if the imaginary time propagator is available in an analytical formulation , like the one we employed here .",
    "when @xmath7 is a good wave function , as for the swf case , we have verified that mixed and direct estimators provide compatible results , and we report here the mixed one for the above mentioned reason . on the contrary , for poor wave functions , like cwf , we had to consider the direct estimator .",
    "as far as @xmath0he systems are concerned , because of the bose statistic obeyed by the atoms , one has , in principle , to account for permutations in the propagator @xmath13.@xcite permutation moves are not strictly requested whenever the initial wave function has the correct bose symmetry .",
    "in fact , the polymer configuration resulting after a permutation can be in principle reached with a combination of standard sampling moves , since the polymers are open.@xcite this is not the case if @xmath7 is not bose symmetric like the gaussian wave function : permutation cycles among particles must be introduced in the sampling in order to get the exact ground state . for all @xmath7",
    "we have implemented permutation sampling following ref .  .",
    "in fact , implementing the sampling of permutations even for a bose symmetric @xmath7 turns out to greatly improve the ergodicity of the sampling .",
    "in addition , we have used swap moves@xcite because they increase the sampling efficiency when computing off ",
    "diagonal properties.@xcite      in order to test the pigs method convergence properties we have considered two bulk phases of a many  body strongly interacting boson system : liquid and solid @xmath0he . dealing with low temperature properties , @xmath0he atoms are described as structureless zero  spin bosons , interacting through a realistic two  body potential , that we assume to be the hfdhe2 aziz potential  @xcite . for the liquid phase ,",
    "we have considered a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions , containing @xmath29 atoms at the equilibrium density @xmath30@xmath31 . for the solid phase we have considered a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions designed to house a fcc crystal of @xmath32 atoms at the density @xmath33@xmath31 . in both cases",
    "we add standard tail corrections to the potential energy to account for the finite size of the system by assuming the medium homogeneous ( i.e. @xmath34 ) beyond @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the size of the box .",
    "obviously , this is not an accurate assumption specially for the solid phase in such a small box , but our main purpose here is to show that pigs method is able to reach the same results independently on the considered initial wave function .",
    "moreover we have studied the fcc lattice , which is stabilized by the cell geometry and by the periodic boundary conditions , whereas at zero temperature , the hcp lattice is the stable lattice .",
    "computations of ground state properties of bulk @xmath0he with accurate tail corrections can be found in the current literature.@xcite      the standard initial wave functions commonly used within pigs method@xcite are the variational jastrow wave function ( jwf ) for the liquid and the jastrow - nosanow ( j - nwf ) for the solid .",
    "a jwf represents the simplest possible choice of wave function for strongly interacting bosons@xcite and it contains only two  body correlations . using a mcmillan pseudopotential,@xcite the unnormalized jwf reads as @xmath37 the physical meaning of this jwf is that , due to the sharp repulsive part of the interaction potential @xmath38 in the hamiltonian @xmath2 , @xmath0he atoms prefer to avoid each other .",
    "in the j - nwf the jwf is multiplied by a term like the one in eq .   below , that localizes the particles in a crystalline order . in this work , however , in order to explore the convergence properties of the pigs method , we have considered two wave functions of `` opposite '' quality : the best available one , that is the shadow wave function , and the poorest imaginable one , i.e. the constant wave function .",
    "jwf will be considered only when computing the one  body density matrix in the liquid phase .",
    "the constant wave function is the ground state wave function of the ideal bose gas , @xmath39 it carries no correlation at all .",
    "we choose this wave function because , allowing an unrestricted sampling of the full configurational space , it results in no importance sampling . then the whole imaginary time projection procedure is driven only by the short time evolution operator @xmath13 , without any input , and then any bias , from the initial state .",
    "thus at the starting point the system is made up by free particles ; if after a long enough imaginary time projection , pigs turns out to be able to reach a strong correlated quantum liquid and quantum crystal by itself we can safely believe that no variational bias affects pigs results .    on the other hand , we choose as @xmath7 a swf given by variational computation in order to have as reference results the ones coming from the projection of an initial wave function that is more accurate as possible , i.e. from a wave function whose overlap with the exact ground state is known to be large . in the swf , additional correlations",
    "besides the standard two body terms are introduced via auxiliary variables which are integrated out.@xcite this is done so efficiently that the crystalline phase emerges as a spontaneously broken symmetry process , induced by the inter  particles correlations as the density is increased , without the need of any a priori knowledge of the equilibrium positions and without losing the translationally invariant form of the wave function .",
    "thus swf is able to describe both the liquid and the solid phase with the same functional form and it is explicitly bose symmetric .",
    "the standard swf functional form reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the set of auxiliary shadow variables , @xmath42 is the standard jastrow two body correlation term , @xmath43 is a kernel coupling each shadow to the corresponding real variable , and @xmath44 is another jastrow term describing the inter  shadow correlations . as usual,@xcite",
    "we take @xmath43 gaussian and in @xmath45 we use the rescaled and dilated he  he potential @xmath38 as pseudopotential .",
    "the variational parameters we use were chosen in order to minimize the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath2 and are reported in ref .  .",
    "nowadays the swf represents the best available variational wave function for @xmath0he systems.@xcite recently , we have estimated@xcite that , when describing a two dimensional solid , swf overlap per particle with the true ground state is of about 99.8% , which ensures a fast convergence rate when projected within the pigs method .",
    "the properties of the swf are so peculiar that the pigs method that has a swf as @xmath7 deserves an its own name and is dubbed spigs : shadow path integral ground state method.@xcite in the picture of linear polymers , the presence of the shadow variables adds two extra variational links , one at each end of the polymer .    in order to test how robust pigs is , we consider also a `` wrong '' wave function : for the liquid phase we consider a gaussian wave function , where each particle is harmonically localized around fixed positions @xmath46 @xmath47 i.e. @xmath7 it the wave function of an einstein harmonic solid .",
    "the parameter @xmath48",
    "@xmath49 is arbitrary and it is was chosen to ensure a strong localization of the particles around the positions @xmath46 that were taken over a regular cubic lattice within the simulation box .",
    "this wave function is evidently not translationally invariant and not bose symmetric .",
    "furthermore it does not contain any correlation between the particles , and all the information that it carries is that of a crystalline system , i.e. gwf is an extremely poor wave function for the liquid phase .",
    "this wrong initial wave function will provide a stringent test on the convergence properties of the pigs methods .    as far as the one  body density matrix computation in the liquid phase is concerned , the values of the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the jwf have been chosen equal to the ones of the corresponding jastrow term in the swf .",
    "one of the fundamental elements of path integral projection monte carlo methods is the imaginary time propagator @xmath13 , whose accuracy turns out to be crucial to the convergence to the exact results .",
    "the functional form of @xmath13 for a generic @xmath14 is unfortunately not known with exception of few particular cases , such as , for example , the free particle and the harmonic oscillator , but accurate approximations of @xmath13 are obtainable in the small @xmath14 regime.@xcite in this work , we have chosen the pair ",
