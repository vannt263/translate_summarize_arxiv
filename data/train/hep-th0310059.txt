    "an introduction of a s - brane seems to be important .",
    "the present result is quite different from the previous study @xcite where truncated theory was employed .",
    "since the truncation is often used in higher derivative theory for non - adequate regime , the previous trial study is still worthy as a first step . from the present study",
    ", however , we learned that such rough truncation approach does not give us good predictions .",

    "we assumed that the bulk stress tensor is composed of a negative cosmological constant and the brane action is bi one . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is claimed that the gauge field can not be a source of gravity on the d - brane without a cosmological constant . to recover the ordinary einstein equation ,",
