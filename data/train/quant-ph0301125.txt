    "one knows that @xmath23 is an element of a set @xmath24 of possible states .",
    "then one can get some information on @xmath23 if and only if there is a projection @xmath25 commuting with all matrices in @xmath24 such that the value @xmath26 is not the same for all @xmath27 .    as noted in @xcite",

    "timing information is always to some extent quantum information that can not be read out without state disturbance .",

    ". however , this situation is actually the infinite energy limit since semi - group dynamics of this form is generated by coupling the system to a heat bath of infinite size and infinite energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "of course the fact that well - known derivations of relaxation dynamics require heat baths with infinite energy spectrum does not prove our claim that this is necessarily the case .",

    "[ main ] we show quantitatively to what extent information on the ( non - discrete ) time is always quantum information as long as the clock is a system with limited energy bandwidth @xmath0 .",
    "explicitly , we prove a lower bound on the entropy increase in the clock caused by von - neumann measurements , i.e. , measurements that are described by an orthogonal family of projections where the state change of the system is described by the projection postulate .",
    "generalized measurement procedures are considered in section [ gen ] .",
    "they do not necessarily increase the entropy of the measured clock since the process can include some kind of cooling mechanisms but will lead to an increase of entropy of the total system which includes the clock s environment .",
    "this has implications for low power computation since it shows that the distribution of timing information inherent in a microscopic clock produces necessarily some phenomenological entropy .    in section [ tight ]",
    "we discuss whether our bound is tight . in section [ dec ]",
    "we shall show that the result of section [ gen ] can be applied to the situation that a clock with limited energy controls the switching process of a classical bit . here a classical bit is understood as a two state quantum system on which decoherence takes place on a time scale that is in the same order as the switching time or on a smaller scale . for low power computation",
    ", this proves which amount of dissipation is required whenever the autonomous dynamics of a microscopic device controls a classical output . in section [ group ]",
    "we apply the bound to other one - parameter groups .",
    "for the moment we will restrict our attention to von - neumann measurements .",
    "for technical reasons we will assume them to have a finite set of possible outcomes .",
    "hence the measurement is described by a family @xmath39 of mutual orthogonal projections on the system s hilbert space @xmath40 that may be infinite dimensional .",
    "the state of the system is described by a density matrix , i.e. , a positive operator with trace @xmath41 acting on @xmath40 . according to the projection postulate any state @xmath42 changes to the post - measurement state @xmath43 if the _ unselected _ state is considered , i.e. , the outcome is ignored .",
    "the post - measurement state @xmath44 coincides with @xmath42 if and only if @xmath42 commutes with all projections @xmath45 .",

    "this is the essential statement that is used to prove the information - disturbance trade - off relation .",
    "but first we have to introduce the energy bandwidth of a system . for hamiltonians with discrete eigenvalues",

    "the unselected post - measurement state is hence given by @xmath128 clearly , in this general setting it is even possible that the measurement can decrease the entropy of the clock since the maps @xmath125 may include processes that are cooling mechanisms for the clock and transport entropy to the environment .",

    "we assume the state @xmath42 of the apparatus to be invariant under its free evolution .",
    "otherwise the measurement apparatus would be a clock in its own since it contained some information about the time @xmath31 .",

    "now we show that the stationarity of the apparatus state ensures that the bound in theorem [ mainth ] holds for the considered kind of generalized measurement as well .",
    "formally , we claim :    [ mainthgen ] let @xmath137 be a density matrix on a hilbert space @xmath138 .",

    "let the measurement have the time resolution @xmath1 in the sense of theorem [ mainth ] .",
    "then we have the following lower bound on the average entropy increase @xmath141 of the composed system caused by the measurement : @xmath142    proof : clearly , the hamiltonian @xmath130 is irrelevant for the evolution of the state @xmath143 due to @xmath144 hence we can treat the evolution as if it was implemented by the hamiltonian @xmath145 , which can assumed to be bounded as in section [ main ] .",
    "@xmath57 .    note that our arguments do not require that the time evolution @xmath131 takes place on a smaller time scale than @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is that we have argued that @xmath146 may formally be considered as projections of a measurement performed _ before _ the interaction was switched on .    our results in section [ main ] and [ gen ]",
    "may be given an additional interpretation as information - disturbance trade - off relation .",

    "however , using the symbols @xmath152 instead of @xmath153 , we emphasize that these definitions do not agree with ours .",
    "note that the energy spread @xmath154 is _ at most _ the energy bandwidth @xmath0 .",
    "but @xmath151 can exceed our time resolution @xmath1 by an arbitrary large value .",
    "this shows the following example : assume the clock to be a two - level system with period @xmath155 .",
    "set @xmath156 with @xmath157 given the prior information that the time is in an interval @xmath91 $ ] with @xmath158 we can only estimate the time up to multiples of @xmath155 and obtain an error in the order @xmath159 .",
    "in contrast , the time resolution @xmath1 in our sense is @xmath160 since we can certainly distinguish between the state at the time @xmath31 and at @xmath161 .",
    "however , we conjecture that similar bounds as in theorem [ mainth ] on the entropy generation can be given for systems where the energy spectrum is _ essentially _ supported by an interval @xmath162 $ ] . therefore our results suggest the following interpretation : every measurement that allows to estimate the time up to an error that is not far away from the heisenberg limit produces a non - negligible amount of entropy .",
    "the following example suggests that the necessary entropy generation may even be much above our lower bound if `` time measurements '' are used that are extremely close to the heisenberg limit .",
    "consider the wave function of a free schrdinger particle moving on the real line .",
    "a natural way to measure the time would be to measure its position .",
    "we may use , for instance , von - neumann measurements that correspond to a partition of the real line into intervals of length @xmath163 .",
    "assume one wants to improve the time accuracy by decreasing @xmath163 arbitrarily .",
    "the advantage for the time estimation is small if @xmath163 is smaller than the actual position uncertainty of the particle .",
    "however , if the state is pure it is easy to see that the generated entropy goes to infinity for @xmath164 .",
    "the following example shows that the entropy generation in a time measurement can really go to zero when @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "consider the hilbert space @xmath165 of square sumable functions over the set of integers .",
    "let @xmath166 with @xmath167 be the canonical basis vectors .",
    "let the hamiltonian be the diagonal operator @xmath168 consider the state @xmath169 by fourier transformation @xmath40 is isomorphic to the set @xmath170 of square integrable functions on the unit circle @xmath24 and the dynamical evolution is the cyclic shift on @xmath24 .",
    "the period of the dynamics is @xmath171 . in this picture , @xmath15 is a wave package that has its maximum at the angle @xmath172 with an uncertainty @xmath173 in the order @xmath174 .",
    "we assume to know that the true time is in the interval @xmath175 and construct a measurement that allows to decide for each @xmath176 whether the true time is @xmath31 or @xmath177 with confidence that is increasing with @xmath178 .",
    "we use a measurement with projections @xmath179 projecting on the four sectors of the unit circle .",
    "if the angle uncertainty is considerably smaller than @xmath180 this measurement can clearly distinguish between @xmath31 and @xmath181 with high confidence .",
    "hence , for @xmath178 large enough , we get @xmath182 as time resolution of the measurement .",
    "note that we have only non - negligible entropy generation at that moments where the main part of the wave packet crosses the border between the sectors , i.e. , when there are two sectors containing a non - negligible part of the wave function .",
    "if , for instance , each sector contains about one half of the probability , we generate the entropy one bit , i.e. , the entropy @xmath183 in natural units .    the probability that the measurement is performed at a time in which non - negligible entropy generation takes place is about @xmath184 .",
    "the average entropy generation decreases therefore for increasing @xmath178 , i.e. , for increasing @xmath185 .",

    "the probability to meet these times is zero .",
    "for all the other times @xmath31 there is one @xmath76 such that @xmath190 tends to zero with @xmath191 by standard fourier analysis arguments .",
    "note that a measurement at time @xmath31 produces the entropy @xmath192 we conclude by elementary analysis that @xmath58 tends to zero with @xmath193 for all times @xmath31 except from @xmath188 irrelevant values @xmath31 and therefore the average entropy generation tends to zero with @xmath193 .",
    "note that the decrease of the lower bound of theorem [ mainth ] is asymptotically a little bit faster since it is @xmath191 ( due to @xmath185 ) .",
    "now we consider the system consisting of the clock , its environment and the classical bit . for the moment",
    "we ignore the fact that the bit is quantum and claim that the two logical states @xmath194 and @xmath41 correspond to an orthogonal decomposition @xmath195 of subspaces of the hilbert space of the composed system . if @xmath196 and @xmath197 are non - isomorphic as hilbert spaces we extent the smaller space such that they are isomorphic .",
    "then we can assume without loss of generality @xmath40 to be of the form @xmath198 without assuming that the bit is physically realized by a two - level quantum system .",
    "the fact that the bit is classical will now be described by the fact that it is subjected to decoherence , i.e. , that all superpositions between @xmath5 and @xmath4 are destroyed and changed to mixtures on a time scale that is not larger than the switching time .",
    "decoherence keeps the diagonal values of the density matrix whereas its non - diagonal entries decay .",
    "if the process is a uniform time evolution , i.e. , given by a semi - group dynamics , decoherence of the two - level system is given by an exponential decay of both non - diagonal entries : @xmath199 where @xmath200 are the coefficients of the density matrix .",

    "the decoherence process can be simulated by measurement processes that are performed at randomly chosen time instants .",
    "this analogy is explicitly given as follows : let @xmath203 be the effect of the measurement that distinguishes the two logical states .",
    "then we have @xmath204 the second expression provides the following intuitive approximation of the process : in each small time interval of length @xmath205 a measurement is performed with probability @xmath206 .",

    "the reason that we do not assume it to switch between @xmath194 and @xmath41 is that this is impossible within a finite time interval with a hamiltonian that has limited spectrum .",
    "this can be seen by the fact that all expectation values with hamiltonians of lower ( ! ) bounded spectrum are analytical functions @xcite .",
    "consider the case that the decoherence time is small compared to the switching time @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath212 .",
    "then the probability to have more than one measurement during the switching process is small ( of second order in @xmath213 ) and the probability that one measurement occurs is about @xmath214 .",
    "given that it occurred , the probabilities of its time @xmath215 of occurrence is equally distributed in @xmath210 $ ] .",
    "since entropy is convex the entropy generated by the switching process is at least @xmath214 times the entropy that is generated if a measurement has occurred during the switching process . also by convexity arguments ,",
    "we conclude that the entropy generated by the process `` perform a measurement at a randomly chosen ( unknown ) time instant in @xmath210 $ ] '' is at least the average entropy generation if the time instant is known .",
    "the latter situation meets exactly the assumptions of theorem [ mainth ] with the following parameters : set @xmath216 , i.e. , assume that the prior information is that the true time is in @xmath217 . furthermore the switching time @xmath1 coincides with the time resolution @xmath1 of theorem [ mainth ] since reading out the logical state can distinguish between the times @xmath194 and @xmath1 with error probability at most @xmath95 . taking into account that a measurement occurs only with probability @xmath214 we multiply the bound of theorem [ mainth ] by this factor and obtain :    @xmath218    note that we do not speak about _ average _ entropy generation since we consider ( in contrast to theorem [ mainth ] ) the entropy of a single density matrix which is already an average over a set of density matrices which are obtained when the measurement occurs at different times .",
    "consider now the case that the decoherence time is so small that more than one measurement during the switching process is likely .",

    "if @xmath226 is the generator of a relaxation process that causes directly transitions from the state @xmath4 to the state @xmath5 the equation @xmath227 does not hold , i.e. , @xmath226 would not be irrelevant for our proof .",
    "this is consistent with the observation in section [ in ] that the `` relaxation clock '' can be read out without generating entropy _ by the measurement_. we conclude that the bound ( [ coh ] ) holds for arbitrarily high decoherence rate .",
    "formally , the bound predicts infinite entropy production if @xmath1 and @xmath0 are constant and @xmath228 .",
    "however , this asymptotics is meaningless due to the quantum zeno effect ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "infinite decoherence would stop the switching process completely .",
    "consider a short time @xmath31 after a measurement has been performed on the state .",
    "then the derivative of the probabilities @xmath229 corresponding to a second measurement is only of the order @xmath230 .",
    "the essential consequence is that in particular for small @xmath0 when our bound would predict large entropy generation fast switching processes are impossible .    in order to show how to apply our bound to realistic situations consider the following example : a light signal ( guided by an optical fiber , for instance ) is sent to an apparatus that contains a two - level system .",
    "the incoming signal triggers the transition @xmath231 from the lower to the upper level ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the apparatus may be a huge physical system and we are only interested in the fact that the _ transition time _ is given by the incoming light signal , the energy may be provided by the apparatus itself .",
    "assume the light signal consists of photons with frequency bandwidth @xmath232 .",
    "the signal is assumed to contain at most @xmath178 photons . than the energy bandwidth of",
    "the signal is at most @xmath233 .",
    "for @xmath234 the time evolution of the total system is evolving approximatively as @xmath235 where @xmath42 is the ( stationary ) state of the apparatus .",
    "when the signal meets the apparatus the time evolution is given by an unknown hamiltonian @xmath236 of the total system combined with the decoherence of the two - level system .",
    "the energy bandwidth of the total system according to @xmath236 is unknown .",
    "the `` measurement '' on the two - level system takes definitely place at a moment where the total evolution of the system is generated by the unknown hamiltonian @xmath236 .",
    "nevertheless we can apply the bound of theorem [ mainthgen ] . in section [ gen ]",
    "we have argued that theorem [ mainthgen ] does not assume that the measurement interaction was only switched on during a time interval that is small compared to the time resolution @xmath1 .",
    "we observed that the measurement can formally be considered as a measurement that had been performed _ before _",
    "the interaction had been switched on .",
    "analogously , we argue that the unknown interaction between light field and apparatus is irrelevant : let @xmath237 be the state of the total system at the time @xmath31 .",
    "let the switching process happen during the interval @xmath210 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath238 be the time evolution of the total system implemented by a possibly unbounded hamiltonian .",
    "the entropy generated by `` measurements '' @xmath45 performed on the state @xmath237 during this period due to the decoherence is the same as produced by @xmath239 performed on the state @xmath240 .",
    "for @xmath241 the family of states @xmath242}$ ] evolve approximatively like the free evolution @xmath243 of the light field .",
    "we conclude that the bound in eq .",
    "( [ coh ] ) can be applied and the relevant energy bandwidth is the energy bandwith of the free light field .",
    "the entropy generation is at least @xmath244    statements of this kind may be relevant in future computer technology when miniaturization reduces signal energies on the one hand and requires on the other hand reduction of power consumption .",
    "our results show that reduction of signal energy down to the limit of the energy - time uncertainty principle leads unavoidably to heat generation as long as the signal control _",
    "classical _ bits .",
    "the entropy generation @xmath58 leads to an energy loss of @xmath245 ( where @xmath178 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath159 is the absolute temperature ) due to the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "obviously , our results generalize to other one - parameter groups since the proofs do not rely on the interpretation of the unitary group @xmath246 as the system s _ time _ evolution .",
    "consider for instance the case that the momentum of a schrdinger wave package is restricted to the interval @xmath247 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath23 be the particle s density matrix and @xmath248 the state translated by @xmath249 .",
    "then we conclude that every measurement that is suitable to distinguish between @xmath248 and @xmath250 in the sense of theorem [ mainth ] produces at least the entropy @xmath251 .",
    "note that the measurement is not necessarily a position measurement , it has not even to be compatible with the position operator . in this sense",
    ", our results may be interpreted as a kind of `` generalized uncertainty relation '' .",
    "another very natural application is to consider the group of rotations around a specific axis .",
    "consider a spin - k/2 particle and the group of rotations @xmath252 on its hilbert space @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is the operator of its angular momentum in @xmath255-direction .",
    "we have @xmath256 and conclude the following : each measurement that distinguishes between @xmath257 and @xmath258 with error probability at most @xmath95 produces at least the entropy @xmath259 .",
    "our bound on the entropy that is generated when information about the actual time is extracted from quantum system holds only for hamiltonian time evolution .",
    "a simple counterexample in section [ in ] has shown that time readout without state disturbance is possible for some dissipative semi - group dynamics .",
    "this leads to an interesting question : in physical systems , each dissipative semi - group dynamics that is induced by weak coupling to a reservoir in thermal equilibrium is unavoidably accompanied by some loss of free energy .",
    "this shows that the loss of free energy caused by the time measurement can only be avoided by systems that loose energy during its autonomous evolution",
    ". it would be desirable to know whether there is a general lower bound ( including dissipative dynamics ) on the total amount of free energy that is lost as soon as timing information is converted to classical information .",
