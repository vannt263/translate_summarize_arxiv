    "the case of charged boson - stars in a scalar - tensor gravitational theory has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to find numerical solutions , resembling q - stars , of the eym equations in the presence of a higgs doublet in the fundamental representation of @xmath7 in bd theory or in a general scalar - tensor gravitational theory and to compare the above results with the solutions obtained in general relativity . in the absence of the gauge field ,",

    "the difference between this soliton and the usual non - abelian q - balls is that the symmetry space in the case of non - abelian q - balls is the entire @xmath2 space but in our case is an abelian @xmath1 subgroup of the @xmath7 group , though both field configurations are non - abelian . also , we investigate the fundamental and not the adjoint representation of @xmath7 . in any case",

    "we studied eym equations in the presence of a higgs doublet in brans - dicke and a simple scalar - tensor gravitational theory and compared our results with the solutions of general relativity .",
    "the higgs doublet is characterized by a potential admitting q - star type and and q - ball type solutions in the absence of gauge fields and gravity and gauge fields respectively .",
    "it is a matter of simple algebra to verify this claim .",
    "so , the eym - higgs equations _ reduce _ to a system of equations corresponding to ( charged ) soliton stars .",
    "these objects are _ stars _ and not black holes , having no horizon or other anomalies .",
    "there are two crucial parameters , resulting from the soliton star itself , the field strength , @xmath22 and the eigenvalue @xmath84 which in the absence of gauge fields reduces to the usual soliton eigen - frequency .",
    "the above eigenvalue is straightforward connected to gravity strength on the surface , through eq .",
    "so , a soliton with small @xmath84 shows a stronger gravitational force on its surface , which corresponds to a more massive , or denser soliton , and this can be verified by our figures .",
    "also , larger value for the field strength , increases the energy and radius of the field configuration due to the electrostatic repulsion between the different parts of the soliton , when the value of the scalar field within the soliton decreases for the same reason .",
    "these results hold true in general relativity as well as in scalar - tensor theories .    in figures [ figure1]-[figure5 ] the results of general relativity",
    "are not depicted because they almost coincide with the @xmath98 ( solid lines ) case .",
    "@xmath119 is the lower experimental limit .",
    "the results of general relativity are exactly reproduced when @xmath120 . in figures",
    "[ figure6]-[figure10 ] we study the behavior of the soliton parameters for @xmath121 .",
    "the results of general relativity are practically reproduced for @xmath122 as one can see from the dashed lines in figures [ figure6]-[figure10 ] , which correspond to the results of general relativity .",
