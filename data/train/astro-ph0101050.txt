    "low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are a heterogeneous population of objects , with low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ) and compact starbursts being two of the many possible power sources ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . from the point of view of the physics of accretion onto compact objects ,",
    "those liners that are true llagns are particularly interesting . at the low accretion rates onto the supermassive black holes at the centers of these liners , the accretion flows are _ qualitatively _ different from what occurs in more luminous seyfert galaxies and quasars .",
    "it is therefore extremely interesting that in the past few years several liners have been identified as _ bona - fide _ agns based on the presence of broad , and sometimes variable , balmer lines in their optical spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here we report our discovery of a previously unrecognized liner and a true agn with broad and variable balmer lines in the s0 galaxy ngc  3065 ( also known as vii zw 303 ) . thus ngc",
    "3065 joins the growing set of liners with variable , broad balmer lines , which includes such famous objects as ngc  1097 @xcite and m81 @xcite .",
    "ngc  3065 ( @xmath4 , at a distance of 47.3  mpc ; from tully 1987 , but for @xmath5 ) has been known to have emission lines since the mid-1950s @xcite .",
    "it was detected as a radio source at 1.4  ghz in the nvss survey @xcite with a monochromatic luminosity of @xmath6 , and as an x - ray source with the _ einstein _ ipc with a 0.24  kev luminosity of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "more recent x - ray observations with _ asca _ gave a 210  kev luminosity of @xmath8 , with a spectrum that can be described either as a power - law with a photon index of 1.8 , or a 6  kev thermal plasma @xcite .",
    "there was no evidence for x - ray emission from a cooler thermal plasma as is found in many other liners ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum led @xcite to suggest that ngc  3065 harbors a llagn and motivated us to obtain new optical spectra in order to evaluate its credentials further .",
    "we obtained spectra of ngc  3065 with the mdm observatory s 2.4 m telescope and boller and chivens ccd spectrograph on 2000 may 31 ut , and with the kitt peak national observatory s 2.1 m telescope and goldcam spectrograph on 2000 june 5 ut . in the former set of observations we used a 15 slit and a 150  mm@xmath9 grating with a total exposure time of 2000  s to cover the wavelength range 32006860    at a spectral resolution of 12.4   . in the latter we used a 19 slit and a 600  mm@xmath9 grating with a total exposure time of 1800  s to cover the wavelength range 55708540    at a spectral resolution of 4.2   . in both cases ,",
    "spectra were extracted from a 16 window along the slit . because of the narrow apertures used , which were comparable to the size of the seeing disk , the absolute flux scale is somewhat uncertain .",
    "wavelength calibration was carried out with the help of arc spectra obtained immediately after the object exposure , and flux calibration was carried out with the help of standard stars observed on the same night and reduced in the same manner as the object .",
    "the final , reduced , and combined spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] . to investigate possible variability of the _ broad _ h@xmath0 line we also examined the spectrum of ngc  3065 taken during the cfa redshift survey on 1980 february 10 with the mt .",
    "hopkins 1.5 m telescope through a 3@xmath1012  aperture and originally reported by @xcite .",
    "although the flux scale of this spectrum was not calibrated , it can still provide information on the presence and profile of any _ broad _ h@xmath0 line .",
    "although the optical continuum of ngc  3065 is dominated by starlight , a broad h@xmath0 line is obviously present ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) . to isolate the emission lines and measure their properties we modeled the continuum as a linear combination of starlight and a non - stellar component and subtracted it . to describe the starlight we experimented with spectra of elliptical or s0 galaxies ( ngc  3379 , ngc  4339 , ngc 4365 , and ngc  5322 ) , while the non - stellar continuum was assumed to have a power - law spectrum of the from @xmath11 .",
    "we found that the spectrum of ngc  4339 provides an excellent match to the continuum of ngc  3065 , with no need for a non - stellar component .",
    "the non - stellar continuum need not contribute more than 10% of the flux at the wavelengths of h@xmath0 or h@xmath12 and no more than 15% of the flux at the wavelength of the [ ]  @xmath133727 line .",
    "the residual spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] with the emission lines identified .",
    "it shows the broad h@xmath0 line very clearly , as well as an unambiguously broad h@xmath12 line .",
    "a hint of a broad h@xmath14 line is discernible as well .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that a careful subtraction of the starlight is needed to isolate the emission lines in the vicinity of h@xmath12 since the starlight spectrum has a rather rich absorption - line structure in this region .",
    "it can easily hide or distort the appearance of the h@xmath12 line , as well as the nearby [ ]  @xmath134959 line .",
    "our approach to subtracting the starlight from the mt .",
    "hopkins spectrum was somewhat different , since the flux scale of this spectrum is not calibrated .",
    "we used as a template the spectrum of the s0 galaxy m42 ( ngc  4472 ) , observed during the cfa redshift with the same setup as and within 7 weeks of ngc  3065 .",
    "we subtracted the template spectrum from that of ngc  3065 , after normalizing the continuum around h@xmath0 to unity in both spectra .",
    "this procedure resulted in the removal of all stellar absorption features from the spectrum of ngc  3065 .",
    "a lower limit to the equivalent width of the h@xmath0 line , _ relative to the non - stellar continuum _ is @xmath15   .",
    "this limit is comparable to the equivalent widths of other liners with broad h@xmath0 lines ( e.g. , ngc  4579 , ngc  4450 , ngc  4203 , m81 ) , which are in the range 140530   . for comparison , the equivalent widths of the h@xmath0 lines of well - known seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  4151 , ngc  5548 , mkn  6 , mkn  841 ; measured from the spectra of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are somewhat larger , falling in the range of 500 - 600   .    in table  1",
    "we list the relative emission - line intensities measured from the spectra after subtracting the continuum .",
    "they have been corrected for galactic reddening using @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we also list the widths of the broad balmer lines as well as the widths of the narrow lines included in the kpno spectrum ( unfortunately , the narrow lines in the mdm spectrum are not resolved ) .",
    "if we naively fit the broad balmer lines with single gaussian models , we find that their centroids are blueshifted by about 450  km  s@xmath9 from the reference frame defined by the narrow lines .",
    "however , we also note that at least the h@xmath0 line shows a red asymmetry : the red wing extends about 2,000  km  s@xmath9 further from the narrow component of the line than the blue wing does . to illustrate the properties of the broad - line profiles we plot h@xmath0 and h@xmath12 spectra on a common velocity scale in figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "this illustration brings out the features of the balmer line profiles : a blueshifted shoulder and red wing that is more extended than the blue wing .",
    "it also shows that the broad h@xmath0 line was absent in the 1980 spectrum , which means that it must have appeared some time in the past 20 years . to illustrate the difference between the 1980 and 2000 h@xmath0 spectra more clearly , we superpose the two in the third panel of figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "the 1980 spectrum has been scaled to match the [ ]  @xmath136584 strength of the 2000 spectrum .",
    "the difference between the two is easily discernible , especially on the blue side of the broad h@xmath0 line , where the intensity in the 2000 spectrum is 4 times higher than what would be consistent with the noise of the 1980 spectrum .",
    "-3.3 in -2.6 in    to asses whether the normalization procedure we adopted above is fair , we examined our 2-dimensional spectra of ngc  3065 to search for extended [ ]  @xmath136584 emission .",
    "if the [ ]  @xmath136584 flux were distributed along the slit , then the flux collected in the small apertures we used to extract the 2000 spectra would be considerably less than the flux collected in the larger aperture used in the 1980 observation .",
    "our inspection showed the [ ]  @xmath136584 source to be unresolved .",
    "thus the relative strengths of [ ]  @xmath136584 and broad h@xmath0 are not affected by any missing [ ]  @xmath136584 flux and the above normalization procedure is valid .",
    "the relative intensities of its narrow lines make ngc  3065 a liner . the oxygen line ratios , [ ]  @xmath133727/ [ ]  @xmath17 and [ ]  @xmath136300/ [ ]  @xmath18 , satisfy heckman s original definition of the class .",
    "other line ratios , such as [ ]  @xmath135007/h@xmath19 , [ ]  @xmath136583/h@xmath20 , [ ]  @xmath136300/h@xmath21 , and [ ]  @xmath226717,6731/h@xmath23 , place ngc  3065 in the regions of the diagnostic ratio diagrams occupied by liners , albeit close to the boundary with seyferts ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "the widths of the narrow forbidden lines appear to follow a trend with critical density : lines of higher critical density are broader than lines of lower critical density .",
    "such a trend is often observed in liners and it has been interpreted as an indication that the narrow - line emitting gas is stratified in density @xcite .",
    "the presence of broad balmer lines in the spectrum of ngc  3065 establishes it as an agn beyond doubt , and confirms the suggestion of @xcite based on the x - ray properties .",
    "finding broad balmer lines in the spectra of liners is not unusual .",
    "for example , m81 has been known for quite some time to have broad balmer lines @xcite .",
    "more recently , broad balmer lines have been found in several liners with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ which can obtain spectra through very small apertures that exclude the contaminating starlight very effectively .",
    "examples include ngc  4203 @xcite , ngc  4450 @xcite , and ngc  4579 @xcite .",
    "the sudden appearance or dramatic variability of broad balmer lines in liners is not unheard of either : it has been observed in at least two other cases so far , ngc  1097 @xcite and m81 @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the broad h@xmath0 lines of ngc  4203 , ngc  4450 , and ngc  4579 varied dramatically between the early observations from the mid-1980s @xcite and the later _ hst _ observations from the late 1990s , although one can not be confident in view of the available data .",
    "the broad balmer lines of liners often have double - peaked profiles , which are characteristic of rotation and suggest an origin in an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole ( see above references ) .",
    "this underscores an intimate connection between liners and another class of double - peaked emission line agns , the broad - line radio galaxies ( hereafter blrgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is bolstered by other similarities between the two classes of object . in particular , the relative strengths of the narrow emission lines of blrgs with double - peaked emission lines approach those of liners ( the prototype , arp  102b is a certified liner ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , in pictor  a , whose relative narrow - line strengths are close to liner - like @xcite , the double - peaked balmer lines appeared abruptly in the mid- to late-1980s @xcite .    although the broad balmer lines of ngc  3065 are not double peaked , the fact that their red wing extends further than the blue wing is reminiscent of gravitational redshift of photons originating in the inner part of an accretion disk .",
    "we thus speculate that the broad balmer lines of ngc  3065 originate in the outer parts of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole .",
    "we emphasize that this is by no means a unique explanation for the origin of the broad balmer lines ; it is merely inspired by the profiles of the balmer lines of other similar objects . to assess the plausibility of this hypothesis we have tried to fit their profiles with the disk model developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the result of this exercise is superposed on the observed h@xmath0 profile shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : profiles ] . according to the adopted model , the axis of the disk",
    "is inclined at an angle of @xmath24 to the line of sight and the line - emitting region is between radii of 900 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "the emissivity is a broken power law with radius : @xmath27 , with @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 elsewhere . in this context",
    "it is noteworthy that the profiles of emission lines coming from an accretion disk need not be double - peaked : if the ratio of the inner - to - outer radius of the line - emitting part of the disk is large or the disk is close to face on , the two peaks get close enough together that they merge and the profile appears flat - topped or single - peaked @xcite",
    ". other combinations of model parameters may be able to produce equally good fits .",
    "we have not explored the parameter space because we are only focusing on the plausibility of this interpretation here .",
    "also , more sophisticated disk models which include an eccentricity @xcite or a spiral wave @xcite may be able to reproduce the observed h@xmath0 profile even better , but such detailed modeling is well outside the scope of this paper .    to further explore the similarity of ngc  3065 with liners and blrgs with double - peaked balmer lines we have estimated the mass of its central black hole and the corresponding eddington luminosity . to estimate the black hole mass we used the recently established correlation between it and the stellar velocity dispersion in the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath31 reported by @xcite thus yielded @xmath32 , where the error bar reflects not only the uncertainty in the velocity dispersion but also uncertainties in the parameters describing the correlation between the velocity dispersion and the black hole mass ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a check , we also estimated the black hole mass based on the correlation between it and the blue luminosity of the bulge of the host galaxy ( see the latest version in * ? ? ? * ) and using the bulge - disk decomposition of @xcite , obtaining @xmath33 .",
    "this value is almost a factor of 2 higher than that obtained with the previous method , which is very likely a result of the large scatter about the mean trend between the black hole mass and the bulge luminosity . because of this large dispersion",
    ", we prefer the black hole mass inferred from the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the implied eddington luminosity is @xmath34 .",
    "if we take the bolometric accretion luminosity of ngc  3065 to be 10 times larger than the observed 210  kev x - ray luminosity ( see , for example , * ? ?",
    "* ) , we find an eddington ratio of @xmath35 , which indicates a very low relative accretion rate , a common feature of liners ( see * ? ? ?",
    "at such a low accretion rate the inner accretion disk is likely to be `` advection dominated '' ( an adaf or ion torus ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to form a vertically extended structure that can illuminate the outer , thin disk effectively .",
    "thus , it could power the observed broad - line emission ( cf , * ? ? ?",
    "this geometrical requirement may very well be the reason why disk - like emission lines are preferentially found in agns with very low accretion rates relative to the eddington rate .",
    "in fact , if we are to associate the broad balmer lines of ngc  3065 with emission from an accretion disk , then external illumination of the disk is needed in order to power the line emission .",
    "this is because the h@xmath0 luminosity is @xmath36 while the viscous power output of the line - emitting portion of the disk ( calculated following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is only @xmath37 .",
    "yet another appealing feature of adafs in liners is the fact that their hard spectral energy distribution , which lacks a `` uv bump , '' when combined with a low ionization parameter , can explain the relative strengths of the narrow emission lines @xcite .",
    "the reason for the recent emergence of the broad balmer lines in ngc  3065 , as well as in similarly behaved objects , remains an open question .",
    "one possibility is that the emission lines come from a transient accretion disk which formed from the debris released by the tidal disruption of a star by the black hole ( cf , ngc  1097 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another is a change in the structure of the inner accretion disk associated with a change in the accretion rate , i.e. , a transformation from a thin disk to an adaf @xcite .",
    "perhaps the long - term variations of the balmer - line profiles will provide clues to their origin .",
    "the variations may show evidence for dynamical phenomena ( e.g. , spiral waves in the disk ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may cause fluctuations in the accretion rate .",
    "alternatively , the variations may show evidence for a disk geometry that can be related to its formation process ( e.g. , an eccentric disk formed from tidal debris ; * ? ? ?",
    "we will continue to monitor the broad balmer lines of ngc  3065 in an effort to uncover their cause .",
    "we thank j. huchra for sending us the spectra of ngc  3065 and ngc  4472 obtained during the cfa redshift survey .",
