    "the origin of this paper is the question of whether there is a way to translate the geometric concept of principal bundles to noncommutative differential geometry : the theorem of serre and swan ( cf .",

    "unfortunately , the case of principal bundles is not treated in the same satisfactory way . from a geometrical point of view it is , so far ,",
    "not sufficiently well understood what a  noncommutative principal bundle \" should be .",
    "still , there are several approaches towards the noncommutative geometry of principal bundles : for example , there is a well - developed abstract algebraic approach known as hopf - galois extensions which uses the theory of hopf algebras ( cf .",

    "another topologically oriented approach can be found in [ enoo09 ] ; here the authors use @xmath12-algebraic methods to develop a theory of principal noncommutative torus bundles . in [ wa11 ]",
    "we have developed a geometrically oriented approach to the noncommutative geometry of principal bundles based on dynamical systems and the representation theory of the corresponding transformation groups .",
    "in particular , this last approach ( re- ) covers the classical theory of principal bundles and in this context the question came up under which ( general ) conditions a character on a fixed point algebra of a dynamical system can be extended to the original algebra .",
