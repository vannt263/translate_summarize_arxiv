    "on february 11 the ligo - virgo collaboration announced the detection of gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "they were emitted about one billion years ago by a binary black hole ( bbh ) merger and reached earth on september 14 , 2015 .",
    "the claim , as it appears in the ` discovery paper'@xcite and stressed in press releases and seminars , was based on `` @xmath0 significance . ''",
    "ironically , shortly after , on march 7 the american statistical association ( asa ) came out ( independently ) with a strong statement warning scientists about interpretation and misuse of p - values@xcite .",
    "as promptly reported by nature@xcite , `` this is the first time that the 177-year - old asa has made explicit recommendations on such a foundational matter in statistics , says executive director ron wasserstein .",
    "the society s members had become increasingly concerned that the p value was being misapplied in ways that cast doubt on statistics generally , he adds . ''    in june",
    "we have finally learned@xcite that another ",
    "one _ and a half _ gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers were also observed in 2015 , where by the ` half ' i refer to the october 12 event , highly _ believed _ by the collaboration to be a gravitational wave , although having only 1.7@xmath1 _ significance _ and therefore classified just as lvt ( ligo - virgo trigger ) instead of gw .",
    "however , another figure of merit has been provided by the collaboration for each event , a number based on probability theory and that tells how much we modify the relative beliefs of two alternative hypotheses in the light of the experimental information .",
    "this number , at my knowledge never even mentioned in press releases or seminars to large audiences , is the bayes factor ( bf ) , whose meaning is easily explained : if you considered _  priori _ two alternative hypotheses equally likely , a bf of 100 changes your odds to 100 to 1 ; if instead you considered one hypothesis rather unlikely , let us say your odds were 1 to 100 , a bf of @xmath2 turns them the other way around , that is 100 to 1",
    ". you will be amazed to learn that even the `` 1.7 sigma '' lvt151012 has a bf of the order of @xmath3 , considered a very strong evidence in favor of the hypothesis `` binary black hole merger '' against the alternative hypothesis `` noise '' .",
    "( alan turing would have called the evidence provided by such an huge ` bayes factor , ' or what i. j. good would have preferred to call `` bayes - turing factor''@xcite , makes no sense in that equation and it should have been @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 stand for ` complementary ' ( formally `` exhaustive , mutually exclusive '' ) hypotheses .",
    "the equation should then read @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are _ prior _ and _ posterior _ odds , i.e. , respectively , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "eq.(1 ) of @xcite would then result into @xmath12 or @xmath13 in words @xmath14 ( for log representation of odds and bayes factors see section 2 and appendix e of @xcite and references therein , although at that time turing s contributions , as well as ` bans ' and ` decibans ' , were unknown to the author , who arrived at the same conclusion of turing s 1 deciban as rough estimate of _ human resolution _ to _ judgement leaning _ and _ weight of evidence _  table 1 in page 13 and text just below it . ) ] 100 _ deciban _ , well above the 17 deciban threshold considered by the team at bletchley park during world war ii to be reasonably confident of having cracked the daily enigma key@xcite . )    in the past i have been writing quite a bit on how ` statistical ' considerations based on p - values tend to create wrong expectations in frontier physics ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is the opposite , i.e. to show how p - values might relegate to the role of a possible fluke what is most likely a genuine finding .",
    "in particular , the solution of the apparent paradox of how a marginal ` 1.7 sigma effect ' could have a huge bf such as @xmath15 ( and virtually even much more ! ) is explained in a didactic way .",
    "since this paper can be seen as the sequel of refs . @xcite and @xcite , with the basic considerations already expounded in @xcite , for the convenience of the reader i shortly summarize the main points maintained there .    * the `` essential problem of the experimental method '' is nothing but solving `` a problem in the probability of causes '' , i.e. ranking in credibility the hypotheses that are considered to be possibly responsible of the observations , ( quotes by poincar@xcite ) .",
    "+ @xmath16there is indeed no conceptual difference between `` comparing hypotheses '' or `` inferring the value '' of a physical quantity , the two problems only differing in the numerosity of hypotheses , _ virtually _ infinite in the latter case , when the physical quantity is _ assumed _ , for mathematical convenience , to assume values with continuity.@xmath17 $ ] * the deep source of uncertainty in inference is due to the fact that ( apparently ) identical _ causes _ might produce different effects , due to _ internal _ ( intrinsic ) probabilistic aspects of the theory , as well as to _ external _ factors ( think at measurement errors ) . * humankind is used to live  and survive  in conditions of uncertainty and therefore the human mind has developed a mental ` category ' to handle it : _ probability _ , meant as degree of belief .",
    "this is also valid when we ` make science ' , since `` it is scientific only to say what is more likely and what is less likely '' ( feynman@xcite ) . *",
    "_ falsificationism _ can be recognized as an attempt to extend the classical _ proof by contradiction _ of classical logic to the experimental method , but it _ simply fails _ when stochastic ( either internal or external ) effects might occur . * the further extension of falsificationism from _",
    "impossible _ effects to _ improbable _ effects is simply deleterious . *",
    "the invention of p - values can be seen as an attempt to overcome the evident problem occurring in the case of a large number of effects ( _ virtually infinite _ when we make measurements ) : any observation has a very small probability in the light of whatever hypothesis is considered , and then it ` falsifies ' it . *",
    "logically the previous extension ( `` observed effect '' @xmath18 `` all possible effects equally or less probable than the observed one '' ) does not hold water . ( but it seems that for many practitioners logic is optional  the reason why `` p - values _ often work_''@xcite will be discussed in section [ sec : p - values_bf ] . ) * in practice p - values are routinely misinterpreted by most practitioners and scientists , and incorrect interpretations of the data are spread around over the media ( for recent examples , related to the lhc presumptive 750gev di - photon signal ( see e.g. @xcite and footnote [ fn : lhc_750gev ] for later comments . ) .",
    "* the reason of the misunderstandings is that p - values ( as well as other outcomes from other methods of the dominating ` standard statistics ' , including _ confidence intervals_@xcite ) , do not reply to the very question human minds _ by nature _",
    "ask for , i.e. which hypothesis is more or less believable ( or how likely the ` true ' value of a quantity lies within a given interval ) . for this reason i am afraid p - values ( or perhaps a new invention by statisticians ) will still be misinterpreted and misused despite the 2016 asa statement , as i will argue at the end of section [ ss : principia ] ) . *",
    "given the importance of the previous point , for the convenience of the reader i report here verbatim the list of misunderstandings appearing in the wikipedia at the * end of 2011*@xcite , highlighting the sentences that mostly concern our discourse .",

    "the reason of the ` monstrosity ' of gw150914 was indeed in table 1 of the accompanying paper on _ properties of the binary black hole merger gw150914_@xcite : a bayes factor `` bbh merger '' vs `` noise '' of about @xmath68 ( yes , _ five times ten to one - hundred - twenty - five _ ) .",
    "this means that , no matter how small the odds in favor of a bbh merger were and even casting doubt on the evaluation of the bayes factor , and @xmath69 and data @xmath54 , the bayes factor @xmath69 vs @xmath70 is @xmath71 where for sake of simplicity we identify @xmath69 with `` bbh merger '' and @xmath70 with `` noise '' .",
    "now the question is that _ there is not a single , precisely defined , hypothesis `` bbh merger''_. and the same is true also for the ` null hypothesis ' `` noise '' .",
    "this is because each hypothesis comes with free parameters .",
    "for example , in the case of `` bbh merger '' , the conditional probability of @xmath54 depends on the masses of the two black holes ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) , on their distance from earth ( @xmath74 ) and so on , i.e. @xmath75 . the same holds for the noise , because there is no such a thing as `` the noise '' , but rather a noise model with many parameters obtained monitoring the detectors .",
    "so in general , for the generic hypothesis @xmath5 we have @xmath76 in which @xmath77 stands for the set of parameters of the hypothesis @xmath5 .",
    "but what matters for the calculation of the bayes factor is @xmath78 , and this can be evaluated from probability theory taking account all possible values of the set of parameters @xmath79 , weighting them by the pdf @xmath80 , i.e. ` simply ' as @xmath81 but the game can be not simple at all , because i ) this integral can be very difficult to calculate ; ii ) the result , and then the bf , depends on the prior @xmath82 about the parameters , which have to be properly modeled from the physics case .",
    "a rather simple example , also related to gravitational waves , is shown in @xcite and helped dumping down claims of gw detection based on p - values , resulting in fact in ineffective bayes factors signal vs noise of the order of the unity , with values depending on the model considered .",
    "the calculations of the bf s published by the ligo - virgo collaboration are _ much _ more complicate than those of @xcite ( see @xcite and @xcite and references therein , in particular @xcite ) , and they have highly benefitted of skilling s _ nested sampling _",

    "the busy plot on the left side shows the sensitivity curves of the two interferometers ( red and blue curves , with plenty of resonant peaks ) and how the three signals fall inside them ( bands with colors matching the wave forms of the right plot ) . in short ,",
    "the two curves tell us that a signal of a given frequency can be distinguished from the noise if its amplitude is above them .",
    "therefore all initial parts of the waves , when the black holes begin to spiral around each other at low frequency , are unobservable , and the bands below @xmath83hz are extrapolations from the physical models . later , when the frequency increases , the wave enters the sensitivity range , ] which extends up to a given frequency , after which we ` loose ' it .",
    "the lower and upper boundary frequencies depend on the amplitude of the signal , as it also happens in acoustics .",
    "the plot on the right shows finally the ` waves ' from the instant they enter the optimal 30hz sensitivity region ( the acoustic analogy depicted in footnote[fn : acustic_analogy ] might help ) :    * the wave indicated by gw150914 ( the ` monster ' , with gw standing for gravitational wave and 150914 for the detection date , september 14 , 2015 ) is characterized by high amplitude , but short duration in the sensitivity region , because it fades out at a few hundred hertz .",
    "* gw151226 instead , although of smaller intensity , has a longer ` life ' ( about 1.7 seconds ) in the ` audible ' spectrum , and therefore the signature of a bbh merger is also very recognizable . *",
    "then there is the october 12 event , lvt151012 , which has an amplitude comparable to that of gw151226 , but smaller duration .",
    "it has , nevertheless , about 20 oscillations in the sensitivity region , an information that , combined with the peculiar shape of the signal ( remarkably the crests get closer as time passes , while the amplitude increases , until something ` catastrophic ' seems to happen ) and the fact that two practically ` identical ' and ` simultaneous ' signals have been observed by the two interferometers 3000 km apart , makes the experts highly confident that this is also a gravitational wave .",
    "however , even if at a first sight it does not look dissimilar from gw151226 ( but remember that the waves in fig.[fig : fig1_ligo - june2016 ] do not show raw data ! ) , the october 12 event , hereafter referred as _",
    ", is not ranked as gw , but , more modestly , as lvt , for ligo - virgo trigger .",
    "the reason of the downgrading is that _ `",
    "she ' can not wear a `` @xmath84 s dress '' to go together with the ` sisters ' to the ` sumptuous ball of the establishment . '",
    "_ in fact chance has assigned ` her ' only a poor , unpresentable @xmath85 ranking , usually considered in the particle physics community not even worth a mention in a parallel session of a minor conference by an undergraduate student ..",
    "i hope it is so just by chance and that no `` @xmath86 '' requirement was applied to the data , then filtering out other possible good signals . ]",
    "but , despite the modest ` statistical significance ' , experts are highly confident , because of physics reasons .",

    "indeed the most useful number experimentalists can provide to the scientific community to quantify how the experimental data alone favor the signal hypothesis is the bayes factor , as expounded in the preamble .",
    "and this factor is very large also for cinderella : @xmath3 .",
    "this means that , even if your initial odds signal vs noise were one to one million , the observation of the ligo interferometers turns them into 10,000 to 1 , i.e. a probability of bbh merger of 99.99% . to explain the ligo signals",

    "what instead still holds , of the example sketched in the text , is that the adaptability of @xmath69 makes the p - value calculated from @xmath108 larger that that calculated from @xmath109 , @xmath110 and therefore @xmath69 ` gets preferred ' to @xmath70 .",
    "but , as stated in the text , the alternative hypothesis @xmath69 could be hardly believable , and therefore its ` nice ' p - value will not affect the credibility of @xmath70 .",
