    "one can see that there are helical majorana states crossing the bulk superconducting gap , where the right - going and left - going states are spin splitting ( very small ) , and localized at opposite edges .",

    "finally , we discuss the robustness of topological superconductivity obtained from the two - orbital @xmath48-@xmath49 model and the possible pairing mechanism . as the phase diagram shows , the _ interorbital _ spin - triplet @xmath71 phase wins as long as the interorbital interaction exceeds over the intraorbital one ( @xmath131 ) .",

    "the realistic value of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in tin films are difficult to estimate . nonetheless , the @xmath1 superconductivity in bulk @xmath12-sn is @xmath9-wave pairing from @xmath9 orbit via phonon - mediated mechanism .",
    "it is likely that 2d sn@xmath10 is also a superconductor with a phonon driven pairing mechanism .",

    "such electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath134 in 2d can be modulated and could even be larger than that in 3d  @xcite . with 2d sn@xmath10 film on different insulating substrates such as cdte or inas , the strain from substrate can cause expansion and shrinkage of interlayer spacing , therefore the phonon spectrum can be greatly modulated .",
    "the topological property persists in sn@xmath10 with lattice constant mismatch from @xmath136 to @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "thus , one could maximize @xmath134 without changing the topological properties of sn@xmath10 .",
    "in reality , @xmath132 is usually larger than @xmath133 , and results in a largest energy gain by forming the @xmath9-wave pairing .",
    "however , the effective interaction given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 should include effects of the coulomb interaction and other possible renormalizations .",
    "the coulomb repulsion @xmath138 and @xmath139 renormalizes the bare value of @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
