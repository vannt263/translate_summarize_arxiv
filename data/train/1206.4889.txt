    "solar flares are the observed brightenings that result from a rapid conversion of energy contained in the electrical currents and in the magnetic field within the solar corona into photons through a chain of processes that involves magnetic reconnection , particle acceleration , plasma heating , and ionization , eventually leading to electromagnetic radiation",
    ". large solar flares ( defined here as involving energies in excess of some @xmath3ergs ) can accelerate particles to high energies and are generally associated with coronal mass ejections in which matter and magnetic field are ejected into the heliosphere at velocities of up to @xmath4km / s .",
    "the ejections often drive shocks in which more accelerated particles are generated within the low corona and in the heliosphere . due to these processes ,",
    "solar flares are frequently associated with solar energetic particle ( sep ) events near earth ( see , e.g. , the reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss the relationships between these and other aspects of solar and space weather in some more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "large solar events drive episodes of severe space weather , including strong geomagnetic storms , enhanced particle radiation , pronounced ionospheric perturbations , and powerful geomagnetically - induced earth currents , all of which affect our technological infrastructure from communications to electric power @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of substantial interest to establish the probability distribution for the largest solar flares and their associated energetic particle events and coronal mass ejections .",
    "direct measurements of the energies involved in solar events have been within the realm of the possible only since the beginning of the space age .",
    "whereas the instrumental record spans almost eight decades , it begins with h@xmath5 monitoring , with observation of flare ionizing radiation and energetic particles ( initially by indirect means ) as well as radio emission added over time , eventually culminating in global solar coverage only since 2011 with a patchwork of passbands that range from @xmath6-rays to radio that can , with difficulty , be linked into a comprehensive view of the energies involved ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the frequencies of solar coronal storms that may occur only once per century , or even less frequently , remain to be established .",
    "as we have only a limited understanding of the formation of magnetically - active solar regions and of their explosive potential , we have no theoretical framework that can be used to extrapolate the observed energy distribution of solar flares to energies that lie beyond the observed range .",
    "sun - like stars provide evidence that larger magnetic explosions are possible , with observed energies that exceed the largest observed solar flares by at least three orders of magnitude .",
    "but , as we discuss in later sections , such stars are typically much younger and thus magnetically much more active than the present - day sun , and with generally different patterns in their dynamos as reflected , for example , in the existence of high - latitude or polar activity and in the general lack of simple cycle signatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "can the sun still power events substantially larger than , say , a large , infrequent x30 flare , and , if it can , how likely are such events ? how likely are solar energetic particle events of various magnitudes ?    in this study , we evaluate and integrate the available evidence to quantify the frequency distribution of the most energetic solar events . to this end , we combine direct observations of photons emitted by solar flares with those of their stellar counterparts .",
    "such a comparison offers the advantage that observing an ensemble of sun - like stars enables us to collect statistics on the equivalent of thousands of years of solar time , albeit subject to the problem that stellar flares are typically observed on stars that are much more active than the sun has been at any time in recent millennia .",
    "the association of solar flaring and frequent attendant cmes with energetic particle events offers complementary sources of information on the statistics of extreme solar coronal storms .",
    "first , energetic particles leave observable signatures when they cause nuclear reactions in rocks that are exposed to them , such as lunar rocks @xcite , and even in terrestrial rocks that are protected by the earth s magnetosphere and atmosphere . second",
    ", such energetic particles induce nuclear reactions in the terrestrial atmosphere which leave radioactive fingerprints in a variety of forms , including cosmogenic radionuclides @xmath7c and @xmath8be , that can be traced in the geosphere as deposited , e.g. , in polar ice or in trees .",
    "third , the particles impacting the earth s upper atmospheric layers are expected to cause shifts in the chemical balance which may leave identifiable signatures in precipitation records ; in particular , this pathway to long - term records on extreme solar events has been suggested for nitrate concentrations in polar ice ( sect .",
    "[ sec : nitrates ] ) .",
    "each of these indirect measures ( which we discuss in sects .",
    "[ sec : nuclides ] and  [ sec : nitrates ] ) offers its own difficulties related to its specific geochemical properties and the transport from the atmosphere into its archive .",
    "for example , @xmath7c forms co@xmath9 and enters the global carbon cycle where it becomes heavily smoothed in time ; @xmath8be spikes are subject to fluctuations of the climate and weather , both on earth and throughout the heliosphere ; exposed rock faces can only tell us about the cumulative effect of solar energetic particles over the lesser of the decay time of the radionuclides involved and the duration over which a rock face is exposed to solar particles .",
    "all of these radionuclide records sit on top of a background that is associated with galactic cosmic rays , which themselves are modulated on time scales upward of a few years by the variable solar wind , the heliospheric magnetic field , and the terrestrial magnetic field .",
    "chemical signatures , as we discuss below , offer even greater difficulties , and we conclude that we do not currently see a way to use nitrate concentrations as indicators of sep events .",
    "in addition to these challenges in understanding the temporal modulations and integration of the records of solar energetic particles , there are challenges related to the creation and propagation of these particles before they are recorded .",
    "the relative importance of flares and cme - driven shocks for large sep events continues to be debated : seps are generated both during the initial phases of a flare and in the propagation of cme shocks into and through the heliosphere .",
    "line - of - sight photons and magnetically guided seps follow distinct pathways to earth , so that flares and sep events at earth may be poorly correlated in time , contributing to a complex statistical relationship between the phenomena . establishing their relationship",
    "requires that we understand the angular widths of the particle distributions entering into , and generated within , the heliosphere compared to the @xmath10 solid angle available to flare photons .",
    "another complication , yet to be properly understood , involves the propagation of the seps through the heliosphere , which appears subject to a saturation effect referred to as the `` streaming limit '' ( sect .",
    "[ sec : streaming ] ) .",
    "some of the geometrical considerations involved in the flare - sep correlation in observations at earth are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "these and other issues are discussed in subsequent sections in the context of the available literature .    transport of energetic particles in the geomagnetic field and atmosphere , including a nuclear atmospheric cascade / shower , is relatively well understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "( i.e. , those originating from a flare site or from a heliospheric shock associated with a solar eruption ) is subject to substantial uncertainties ( see section  [ sec : streaming ] ) .",
    "the parameters that set the spectral shape of the particle energy distribution are mostly empirically determined , adding additional difficulties when seeking to quantify the most energetic events that have been rarely observed , in particular for possible very rare events that have never been observed directly at all .",
    "in section  [ sec : intro ] we present a brief overview of the connection between solar flares and energetic particles before they enter the detection systems in the form of spacecraft , ground - based detectors , rocks , ice , or biosphere .",
    "this section is mainly meant for readers who are relatively unfamiliar with these processes and their terminologies .",
    "after this brief introduction of some of the issues to be dealt with when using photons and tracers of energetic particles to learn about solar energetic events , we proceed to integrate solar , stellar , lunar , and terrestrial records in our attempt to establish the probability distribution of the largest solar energetic events .",
    "sections  [ sec : nuclides ] and  [ sec : nitrates ] lead to the finding that sep records can not be used to put tight constraints on the statistics of the largest solar flares , at least at present .",
    "the use of cosmogenic radionuclides to constrain seps near earth is discussed in section  [ sec : nuclides ] . in section  [ sec : nitrates ] we review the evidence , obtained in conjuction with this study , that nitrate concentrations in ice deposits can not , at present , be used to learn about sep events because the analyses of multiple ice cores has recently cast doubt on the suggestion that spikes in nitrate concentrations correlate with sep events ; ice nitrate concentrations may yet be validated as a quantitative metric for sep events , but at present , the correspondence needs to be viewed at most as possible .",
    "sections  [ sec : nuclides ] and  [ sec : nitrates ] clarify why , in the end , we have to rely on direct observations of flares .",
    "these two sections discuss constraints on the flare energy frequency distribution that turn out to be weak at best ; they could be skipped on first reading .",
    "solar and stellar observations do provide interesting information on the flare energy distribution over many orders of magnitude : the comparison of solar and stellar flare observations in various segments of the electromagnetic spectrum is discussed in section  [ sec : flares ] .",
    "section  [ sec : streaming ] contains an evaluation of the transformation of direct sep and flare observations to a common scale for the source strengths near the sun .",
    "flares and eruptions take their energy from the magnetic field within active regions ; the implications of active - region sizes compared to the energies involved in flares and cmes are described in section  [ sec : conversion ] .",
    "we integrate the various findings in a discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "`` flares '' are , by definition , relatively rapid brightenings in the photon spectrum of the sun and other stars . the signatures of flares can be found from very high - energy @xmath6-ray emission to km - wave radio emissions .",
    "the bulk of a flare s energy is radiated at visible wavelengths ( see section  [ sec : flares ] ) , but because of the bright background of the photospheric emission , flares have the highest contrast at x - ray , euv , and radio emissions .",
    "consequently , solar flare monitors generally report on the x - ray signature of the solar spectral irradiance .",
    "flares on stars other than the sun , involving , for example , fully convective late - m type dwarf stars or somewhat evolved stars of near solar mass in tidally locked binary systems , share many of the characterizing properties of solar flares .",
    "stellar flares reported on in the literature are generally much more energetic than even large solar flares , but that is mostly because of the observational constraints of having to measure these stellar flares against the full - disk background coronal emission in stars that are x - ray bright , i.e. , typically young , rapidly - spinning stars compared to the rather slowly rotating sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the thermal emission of flaring ranges from below a million degrees for the smallest events observed in quiet - sun ephemeral regions to at least 100mk for large - energy stellar events ( e.g. , @xcite",
    "; see sect .",
    "[ sec : stellarflares ] for a discussion of some of the largest stellar flares observed to date ) . in emissions characteristic of high energies",
    "( providing direct or indirect measurements of non - thermal particle populations or direct measurements of high - temperature thermal emission ) , solar and stellar flares alike show fast rise and exponential decay phases ( sometimes summarily characterized as `` fred '' ) .",
    "as flares transition from the impulsive ( fast - rise ) to the decay phase , the spectral irradiance typically follows the so - called neupert effect : lower - energy emissions ( e.g. , soft x - rays ) behave , to first order , as the time integral of high - energy emissions such as hard x - rays , non - thermal radio emission , or near - uv ( or u - band ) emission ( for some examples of the neupert effect in stellar flares , see @xcite for the dm5.5 star proxima centauri ; @xcite for the m5.5ve star uvceti ; @xcite for the dme star adleo ; and @xcite for the k1iv+g5iv binary hr1099 ) .",
    "solar flares are typically characterized by the noaa / goes magnitude scale which measures the peak brightness ( increasing in orders of magnitude as a , b , c , m , and x , each followed by a number from 0 to 9.9 measuring the peak brightness within a decade ) .",
    "many flares ( often compact flares ) are characterized by impulsive brightenings and rapid decays , bringing most of the solar spectral irradiance back to near - preflare levels within a matter of minutes to tens of minutes ; other `` long - duration flares '' can have a gradual rise and decay , sometimes lasting more than a dozen hours .",
    "not only are the time scales different , the peak emissions occur from hard x - rays to relatively long - wavelength euv , shifting overall to lower energies during the decay phase of any given flare , while differing between compact and eruptive flares , and between active - region flares and quiet - sun filament eruptions that lead to cmes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , the goes classification scheme is not unambiguously useful as a metric for total flare energies ; we discuss this problem in section  [ sec : flares ] .    whereas the distinct appearance of flares of different magnitudes and phases of evolution in different passbands complicates the bolometric calibration sought in this study , it is likely to play a role in enabling us to detect stellar flares against the full - disk background .",
    "the fact that flares shift through x/(e)uv wavelengths as a function of their magnitude and evolutionary phase restricts the range of flare energies that shows up in any such passband ; this limits the `` depth '' of the distribution function , i.e. , the ratio of largest to smallest flare observable within a given passband ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leaving the largest flares to stand out against the relatively weakened composite background .",
    "even then , the `` background '' itself contains , and may be dominated by , a composite of flares , cf .  the discussion by @xcite of a long observation of the m - dwarf star binary uvceti which shows continuous variability with no well - defined non - flaring level .",
    "the broad wavelength range involved in solar and stellar flares makes it hard to observe the bolometric behavior of flares directly , because observations are typically limited to a relatively narrow bandpass .",
    "hence , transforming the measured signal to an estimated bolometric fluence involves rather uncertain transformations , as discussed in section  [ sec : flares ] .    whereas flare photons from sun and stars are detectable with present - day instrumentation , they leave no signatures that enable us to look back in time",
    ". seps that impact earth or other solar - system bodies do leave such signatures , but their generation and transport introduce a range of challenges to be dealt with before sep signatures can be used to quantify the frequency spectrum of solar flare energies .    over 40 years ago , @xcite presented evidence that there are two principal ways in which particles are accelerated at the sun : ( 1 ) a process associated with reconnection in solar flares that has type iii ( fast - drift ) radio bursts as its defining meter - wave radio emission and electrons with energy of @xmath11kev as its characteristic particle acceleration ; and ( 2 ) acceleration at a shock wave manifested by a ( slow - drift ) type ii metric burst , which is thought to reflect acceleration of escaping electrons and protons at all energies .",
    "@xcite suggested that the type  ii shocks associated with sep events were driven by cmes , a suggestion that has found increasing support @xcite .    by the mid-1980s the basic two - class picture of sep acceleration was strengthened by elemental - composition and charge - state measurements of @xmath12he and higher - mass ions .",
    "the observations revealed that the @xmath12he and fe abundances in the flare ( type iii ) sep events were enhanced by about a factor of @xmath13 and 10 , respectively , relative to that in the shock ( type ii ) events , and that fe charge states were characteristically higher in the flare events ( around 20 in flares versus @xmath14 for the large sep events associated with shocks ) , see the review by @xcite .",
    "the original `` two - class '' paradigm was challenged in the late 1990s when several large ( and therefore presumably shock - associated ) sep events exhibited the elemental composition and charge states of the flare / reconnection sep events ( see * ? ? ? * for a historical review of sep research ) . over time , these unusual large events were interpreted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in terms of particle acceleration in quasi - perpendicular shocks of `` remnant '' seed particles remaining in the low corona and inner heliosphere from earlier flares . around the maximum of the solar cycle , when flares are most frequent , enhanced @xmath12he sep populations are observed in situ near earth some @xmath15%  of the time @xcite .",
    "it is presumed that these remnant populations are also present near the sun where they can be acted on by shocks . because the remnant particles have the composition and charge state characteristics of flare - accelerated particles , the resulting sep event looks like a high - energy flare - event , even though the ultimate accelerator is a shock .",
    "ground - based neutron monitors and ionization chambers have observed some 70 so - called ground - level enhancements ( gles ) in the past seven decades , indicating the presence of fluxes of ions in the energy range @xmath16gev , which will have produced radionuclides .",
    "if the initiating solar activity was within about @xmath17 from central meridian , however , the interplanetary cme will more strongly scatter gcrs , resulting in temporary decrease in the gcr intensity at earth @xcite , commonly referred to as a `` forbush decrease '' .",
    "the cosmogenic radionuclide formation at earth may , in some cases , be overcompensated by the forbush decrease with an associated reduction in gcrs by about 10%  for about a week @xcite , but the details of that depend on the conditions of the event @xcite .",
    "for example , solar eruptions near the western limb produce the most intense gles , and contain the highest fluxes of particles with energies in excess of 5gev , while in this case there typically is no forbush decrease at earth .",
    "we note that for sep proxies with a long mixing time scale within the earth s atmosphere prior to deposition ( specifically for the @xmath8be concentration discussed below ) there is the additional complicating factor that sep - induced increases in the proxy ride on top of variations associated with the gcr variations that are associated with variations in the heliospheric magnetic field and the solar wind on time scales of years or more . to differentiate between , say , large - fluence sep events and extended cycle minima",
    ", one has to make assumptions about the heliosphere that are difficult to validate .     or larger ( for particles with energies in excess of 10mev ) for satellite observations ( histogram ) , and for upper limits derived from lunar radionuclides ( blue ) and terrestrial records (",
    "@xmath18 upper limit shown by a ( blue ) dashed line ) .",
    "the green dashed line shows the slope of the fit to the flare energy frequency distribution from panel _ a _ for comparison , scaled to go through the kink in the satellite - based sep fluence frequency distribution .",

    "this is a type of saturation effect caused when protons streaming from the shock are hampered by their propagation in their own enhancement of the upstream waves @xcite , whose existence is an essential component of the theory of diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "this streaming limit does not apply near the shock , so sep fluxes can exceed the streaming limit when a shock passes directly over earth , or over a satellite outside the geomagnetic field .",
    "a direct way to determine the statistics of solar energetic particle events is to measure energetic particles with space - based instrumentation .",
    "a compilation of the fluences for such events for particle energies exceeding 10mev is shown as a red histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] ( based on data from @xcite ) .",
    "these data are naturally limited to event frequencies exceeding once per fifty years , as that is the current span of the observational record . on the low - fluence side",
    "the range of accessible energies in the frequency spectrum is limited by the detection threshold against the gcr background .",
    "some information on events that are much rarer than once per century can be extracted from exposures that have lasted much longer than a few decades .",
    "seps that impact solar - system bodies leave traces in the form of a mixture of radioactive nuclides .",
    "the production of cosmogenic radionuclides from the exposure to seps can be calculated for a specified elemental composition of the rock and a given shape of the differential energy spectrum using monte carlo simulations @xcite . in a rock , only the time - integrated production rate ( a balance between production and decay ) is recoverable .",
    "the integration time depends on the half - life of the radionuclide in question . as a consequence of the much steeper energy spectrum of seps compared to that of gcrs , seps only produce cosmogenic radionuclides in the outermost layers of the rocks .",
    "this differentiation between gcrs and seps as a function of depth creates a natural spectrometer that enables correction for the contribution from gcr - induced production , although this does require assumptions on the sep energy spectrum in order to thereby estimate upper limits of the frequency of sep events ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "when rocky material from the moon is analyzed , we have access to the cumulative dose of seps without the complicating factors of terrestrial magnetic and atmospheric shielding or the effects of a dynamic weathering environment .",
    "the combined results of lunar rock studies , compiled by @xcite , assuming that the upper limits to the fluences are associated with a few events over the isotopes life time , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] .",
    "these upper limits emphasize the downturn seen at the high - fluence end of the frequency distribution of satellite sep observations , but they are not particularly restrictive in establishing the shape of the spectrum or the strength or fluence of a possible largest sep event size .      the combination of the sep fluence frequencies measured by satellites and the upper limits based on the analysis of lunar rocks shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] illustrates the need to fill a gap for events with cumulative frequencies of less than once per few decades . in this section , we discuss one possibility that is currently being explored , which is the measurement of terrestrial radionuclides stored in a stratified manner that enables setting tighter limits on lower - fluence events .",
    "terrestrial cosmogenic radionuclides are produced mainly by spallation - type nuclear interactions between high - energy ( gev ) particles and nuclei of the dominant atmospheric constituents ( n , o , ar ) .",
    "after production , those radionuclides that end up stored in naturally stratified `` archives '' such as ice deposits , trees , and sediments , prove most useful to our purpose",
    ".    records of cosmogenic radionuclides provide blended information about the solar magnetic activity , the strength of the geomagnetic dipole field , and atmospheric transport and deposition processes . by using independent information about the geomagnetic dipole field , and by combining different records of @xmath8be from ice cores with @xmath7c from tree rings ,",
    "a rather clean signal of the variations in the gcrs due to varying levels of solar activity can be extracted for at least the past 10,000 years .",
    "that record reveals the variability of the solar dynamo and the associated heliospheric magnetic field on time scales ranging from decades to millennia , with grand minima and maxima throughout the long record @xcite .",
    "not only the long - term variations can thus be recovered : there is some promise of recovering shorter - term spikes , albeit that these are washed out by the transport process between generation and deposition , while set against a variable background of the solar dynamo .",
    "the time it takes to transport a newly produced cosmogenic radionuclide from the atmosphere into an archive depends mainly on the altitude at which it is produced .",
    "this ranges from weeks for the troposphere to years for the stratosphere @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the production signal stored in the archive is smoothed and the temporal resolution is limited to about one year at best .",
    "the higher the desired temporal resolution , the more the signal will be influenced by transport processes . over the past 5 years , the use of global circulation models ( gcm ) has greatly improved our understanding of the manner in which atmospheric transport processes influence the deposition of @xmath8be and other radionuclides into polar ice @xcite .    to produce cosmogenic radionuclides a primary ( galactic or solar ) cosmic ray needs energies above about 500mev with a specific yield function depending on the particular isotope . because of the relatively low energies in seps ( compared to gcrs ) the majority of them can only enter the earth s atmosphere at high magnetic latitudes ( exceeding about @xmath19 ) . moreover , again because of the relative softness of the sep energy spectrum , the contribution to the cosmogenic isotope production of most of the sep events that can be observed by satellites in orbit is too small to be detected in ice , rocks , or biosphere against the background production of a radionuclide from gcrs .",
    "some large sep events , however , include solar cosmic rays with energies in excess of 10gev ; these are efficient producers of cosmogenic radionuclides .",
    "their relative contribution to an annual gcr production is small @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true for @xmath7c and @xmath8be ( @xmath20cl is more sensitive to lower energies and is therefore a promising candidate to study strong sep s , but as @xmath20cl is produced by spallation of the relatively rare @xmath21ar this reduces the temporal resolution for standard - sized ice cores or requires considerably larger ice samples to measure it with the required signal - to - noise contrast ) .",
    "sep s recorded by particle detectors during the past 50 years show a range of fluences and spectral steepness .",
    "very large sep events from activity near solar central meridian typically have higher fluences , yet steeper spectra , which makes them deficient in particles exceeding 1gev .",
    "very large sep events from near the west limb of the sun typically have lower fluences but flatter spectra , favoring particle energies in excess of 1gev @xcite .",
    "all of the above effects needs to be factored in when translating radionuclide concentrations to sep fluences .",
    "this leads to substantial differences in estimates .",
    "for example , there are three @xmath7c production models that differ markedly in their estimates of sep fluences .",
    "the first estimate was made by @xcite , based on an empirical parametrization of early measurements of neutron fluxes in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "it predicts that the average sep production rate for a year is @xmath22%  of the gcr annual rate , and that the event of 1956/02/23 ( the largest observed ground level enhancement ",
    "gle   by neutron monitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a very hard spectrum ) would give 1/3rd of the overall annual @xmath7c production .",
    "it is important to note that @xcite made the rather extreme assumption that the magnetic shielding is reduced by a factor of 5 during large solar storms , which leads to a high @xmath7c production rate .",
    "the next estimate was based on a semi - empirical model by d. lal @xcite , who adjusted numerical calculations to fit empirical data .",
    "that model yields an average production for @xmath7c by sep events being less than 1%  on average , while the event of 1956/02/23 would yield only several percent of the annual radiocarbon production @xcite .",
    "a more recent model based on an extensive monte - carlo simulation of the atmospheric particle cascade @xcite suggests that seps contribute , in an average year , only 0.03% to production of @xmath7c .",
    "this very small value may be caused by the neglect of the atmospheric cascade ( and thus neutron capture channel of @xmath7c ) in their model ( cf .",
    "the most recent monte - carlo model @xcite suggest that the average contribution of seps into the global @xmath7c is about 0.2% .",
    "thus , the model predictions differ by more than two orders of magnitude . for the purpose of the present study",
    ", we opt for the most conservative upper limit currently published , based on the work by @xcite : to achieve this , we took the data by @xcite , and shifted them upward in fluence by two orders of magnitude .",
    "these data , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] , support a substantial drop below any power law that can be fit to the satellite observations for events with cumulative frequencies larger than once per century .",
    "the @xmath7c data are clearly more restrictive in that respect than the lunar rock data , in that they lie further below the trend found in the directly observable fluence range .    calculations by @xcite and @xcite , based on the measured spectra of the largest sep in the past 50 years , predicted undetectable effects for @xmath8be , @xmath7c and @xmath23cl assuming global atmospheric mixing , or a barely detectable effect if @xmath8be is dominated by polar production .",
    "this is a consequence of ( a ) the large amplitude of the gcr modulation by the sunspot cycle that dominates the contributions by seps , and ( b ) the high standard deviation ( @xmath2415% ) of annual @xmath8be data .",
    "larger sep events may have happened in the past , however , and increased sample sizes , multiple cores extending back thousands of years , and better understanding of the heliospheric variability on gcr fluxes may make it possible to use radionuclides to inform us on the sep fluence frequency distribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] for frequencies below once per few decades . but",
    "achieving such results requires considerable analysis , well beyond what is feasible in the present study .",
    "when solar energetic particles impact the earth s atmosphere they cause ionization in the polar regions that results in production of no @xcite .",
    "the no is interconverted to other odd nitrogen species , and some of it , at whatever altitude it is produced , should ultimately end up deposited in snowfalls as nitrate ( in aerosol or scavenged from gaseous hno@xmath25 ) , if not destroyed prior to that by chemical interactions at mesospheric and higher layers .",
    "given that seps most readily enter the earth s atmosphere at high geomagnetic latitudes , and because long - lived ice is readily found at high geographic latitudes , it is logical to seek a nitrate signal in polar ice cores .",
    "@xcite reported on the analysis of two ice cores from windless bight in antarctica in which they measured the nitrate concentration going back to about 1905ad .",
    "the antarctic record was later supplemented by a core from summit in greenland ( gisp2 h core ) which was measured at a sampling density of 10 to 20 samples per year ( for samples of 1.5 cm in thickness ) extending back to 1561ad .",
    "the summit core contains spikes in the nitrate concentration that are superposed on a regular seasonal cycle .",
    "these spikes are often just 1 sample wide but occasionally 2 - 3 samples wide , i.e. , occur in a period that could range from a single snowfall up to about 3 months .",
    "the core contains a continuous spectrum of spikes , from many small ones , to over one hundred large to very large ones : the largest spikes are about a factor 5 larger than the typical seasonal cycle amplitude .",
    "dating of these spikes is achieved by counting annual layers in the cores , supplemented by identification of deposits associated with strong known volcanic eruptions . with that information",
    ", the year should be accurately known near the volcanic markers ( 32 over the 430-y record ) , but might deviate by a year or two away from such markers .",
    "the coincidence of some of these spikes with known space - weather events suggested that at least the strongest among them might originate from sep events .",
    "in particular , the strongest ( integrated ) peak in the summit - core record was dated to within a few weeks of the 1859 carrington event , one of the largest known solar flares and associated cme sequences to impact geospace @xcite .",
    "the timing and sharpness of the nitrate spikes is problematic if nitrate is indeed associated with seps , because it is difficult to transport nitrates from above the tropopause quickly enough into tropospheric snowfalls within a matter of at most a few weeks .",
    "furthermore , one would not expect nitrate produced in the middle atmosphere to be deposited over such a short time period , nor would one expect troposheric enhancements by a large factor , as observed in the spikes .",
    "this could be resolved if the snow is actually recording a tropospheric , rather than a stratospheric , production of nitrate . alternatively ,",
    "if the sep event is having its effect higher in the atmosphere , it may be accompanied by one of the rare ( especially in antarctica ) sudden stratospheric warming events which could transport material downwards relatively rapidly , perhaps allowing a response within a month or two .",
    "however , the coincidence of two such rare events would be unusual .",
    "otherwise , one would expect a transport time of order 6 months , and thus no sharp signal in the ice core chemical patterns .",
    "strong nitrate spikes may be caused by terrestrial events or by depositional processes .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "spikes can be induced by changes in scavenging efficiency owing to , for instance , changes in the degree of riming ( the inclusion of supercooled droplets as snow crystals grow ) .",
    "more specifically , spikes in nitrate deposition are induced by conversion of nitric acid to aerosol through association with either sea salt ( for coastal antarctica ) or ammonia ( for central greenland ) leading to deposition of the associated aerosol @xcite .    in the work leading up to this manuscript , @xcite assembled information on a total of 14 ice cores with high time resolution from both arctic and antarctic regions , at various geomagnetic latitudes .",
    "they found that apart from the summit gisp2h ice core , no nitrate signatures were found in the ice dated to 1859 .",
    "several nitrate spikes of a similar nature were found in all the greenland cores , including one from the summit site .",
    "however , all such spikes including one dated to 1863 ( the nearest large spike to 1859 in the later records ) , were associated with an ammonium spike . in the cores where other components were measured ,",
    "black carbon and vanillic acid ( diagnostic of combustion plumes in general , and wood burning , respectively ) were found in each large spike between 1840 and 1880 .",
    "none of these components were measured in the h core , so @xcite can not conclusively identify the origin of the peak labelled as 1859 , but do conclude that it is inevitable that most nitrate spikes in all greenland cores are of biomass burning origin . while it may be possible to isolate very large events that are not of such origin , @xcite",
    "conclude that even the 1859 event was not large enough to give a signal in most ice cores .",
    "it is unfortunately apparent that the statistics of nitrate can not provide the statistics of sep events so that this potential proxy for sep events prior to the mid 20th century can , at present , neither be used to estimate the frequency spectrum of sep events nor to set unambiguous upper limits to a possible historical maximum for such events . in view of this",

    "the differences between the four distributions shown are related to different algorithms for flare characterization and to assumptions about the geometrical extent of the observed events along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "solar flares are a manifestation of the sun s magnetic field , and that field is believed to arise from the interaction of convection with rotation , especially differential rotation : the dynamo mechanism .",

    "we will discuss g- and k - type stars because they are most similar to the sun .",
    "stellar flares can not be resolved spatially and so we can detect only energetic events that produce sufficient contrast against the visible photosphere or the x - ray / radio corona .",
    "in addition , stellar observations often are available for only a limited wavelength range and so it is difficult to gain a full bolometric view of an event .",
    "detectable high - energy flares have been seen on rapidly - rotating gkm stars because the rotation enhances the magnetic field .",
    "single gkm main sequence stars lose angular momentum with age and so the flaring stars are either very young ( up to @xmath50myr old ) , or they are in close binaries where tidal interaction causes spin - up of an older star ; these latter systems are known as by dra binaries ( main sequence ) or rs cvn binaries ( evolved ) .",
    "stellar flares have been reported with x - ray or euv energies as low as @xmath51 ergs @xcite ; this corresponds to a bolometric fluence @xmath52 times higher .",
    "most reports on stellar flaring report fluences much larger than that simply because of the difficulty of detecting small flares against the bright background of the overall corona or photosphere .",
    "more energetic flares have harder emission , and so the passband used biases the detection threshold .",

    "the very large sample size of _ kepler _ ( some 150,000 stars ) corresponds to an effective monitoring time for a single average g star of @xmath61 years , far beyond anything previously done .",

    "one extreme value is @xmath64ergs reported by @xcite , but it remains to be seen if the source of the flare was correctly identified .    from the above , it appears that it is highly unlikely that any flare would exceed @xmath60ergs on a sun - like star in any phase during its evolution once it has comfortably settled on the stellar main sequence .",
    "but that leaves a factor of @xmath65 between the largest observed solar flare and the largest possible for a sun - like star .",
    "are there other empirical constraints that help us narrow that gap ?",
    "figure  [ fig:2b ] shows that the slope for flare electromagnetic fluences ( fig .",

    "we can make the following plausible quantitative argument :    following the reasoning by @xcite , although in part in the opposite direction , we start from the observation that the frequency distribution of particle fluences can be approximated by a power law up to about @xmath73@xmath70 : @xmath74    let us assume that the particles are emitted from their source region at or near the sun into a solid angle @xmath75 that is a function of the total energy @xmath76 of the event , here chosen to be approximated by : @xmath77 the value of @xmath6 can be estimated by comparing the flare energy distribution in eq .",

    "an opening angle of 180@xmath94 is reached for an event frequency of approximately twice per year @xcite , with an uncertainty of at least a factor of two .",
    "that range , shown by dotted horizontal lines in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:2a ] and  [ fig:2b ] , lies just above the frequency where the sep event fluence frequency distribution bends downward , suggesting that geometrical considerations may be a dominant effect in changing the slope of flare to sep fluences at least around the range labeled (i) in fig .",

    "we note , however , that we have insufficient information on the angular width distribution of sep events in general : observations put many of these opening angles for impulsive events on a gaussian - like distribution with @xmath95 @xcite whereas recent stereo observations have shown events with opening angles up to @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this argument offers a plausible origin to the kink in the frequency distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] so that we can not assume that kink is indicative of a change in the behavior of solar flare fluences for the largest flares .",

    "the energy released in large solar coronal storms is ultimately extracted from the electromagnetic field in the solar atmosphere . because that energy is associated with the surface magnetic field , including its sunspots , some constraint may be derivable from sunspot sightings .",
    "one element of this argument is the observation that mature active regions -  within a bounding perimeter including spots , pores , knots , and faculae  - are characterized by a remarkably similar flux density , @xmath97 of about @xmath98mx/@xmath99 to @xmath100mx/@xmath99 @xcite regardless of region size .",

    "no such records of monster spots on the sun have been historically reported or pre - historically recorded , so they are likely not to have occurred over the past centuries or even millenia . in fact , our simple scaling arguments suggest that an upper limit of close to the largest flares observed during the past three decades is consistent with the reported observations on the largest sunspot groups over the past few centuries .",
    "we attempted to combine direct observational records of sep events associated with flares and cmes with upper limits based on lunar rock samples , terrestrial biosphere samples , and ice - core radionuclide concentrations to establish a frequency distribution of approximate particle fluences ( fig .",

    "the lunar and terrestrial samples do constrain sep fluences for the largest events , but only as upper limits for fluences well beyond the historical records obtained during the space age . hence , this information can not at present be used to significantly contribute to our knowledge of the frequency spectrum of flare energy fluences beyond the historically observed range that extends up to about x30 .",

    "should such a calibration become available in the future , effects of limitations on the transport of energetic particles through the heliosphere ( the `` streaming limit '' discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) shall need to be better understood before the @xmath8be upper limit can be mapped to solar flare energy fluences .",
    "we present an argument that the `` kink'' in the sep fluence frequency spectrum around @xmath73@xmath70 does not necessarily reflect a change in the flare - energy spectrum , but may in fact be a consequence of geometrical effects related to the finite opening angle of sep cones .",
    "this effect causes a decrease in detection frequency for smaller opening angles simply because events with smaller extent are more likely to miss the earth , combined with a dilution of the fluence over that opening angle that affects the particle flux density .",
    "this argument is supported by the fact that the frequency at which the kink occurs corresponds relatively well with the frequency for which observed opening angles of cmes approach @xmath10 steradians .",
    "we therefore suggest that this kink likely does not reflect a change in the shape of the solar flare fluence distribution , but rather that it reflects the geometry of sep generation and propagation .",
    "require that much of the solar surface be covered by strong kilo - gauss fields , exhibiting large sunspots that have not been recorded in four centuries of direct scientific observations and in millenia of sunrises and sunsets viewable by anyone around the world .",
    "for example , a flare with an energy of around @xmath122ergs should require a spot coverage of just over 10%  of a solar hemisphere , which would be readily visible even to naked - eye observers if it occurred .",
    "sunspot records suggest that no regions were observed in the past four centuries that could power flares larger than those observed in the most recent three decades .",
    "we conclude that flare energies for the present - day sun have either a true upper cutoff or at least a rapid drop in frequency by several orders of magnitude below the scaled stellar frequency spectrum for energy fluences above about x40 . based on the direct solar observations and the indirect arguments presented in this study , solar flares with energy fluences above about x40",

    "<S> the most powerful explosions on the sun   in the form of bright flares , intense storms of solar energetic particles ( seps ) , and fast coronal mass ejections ( cmes )   drive the most severe space - weather storms . </S>",
    "<S> proxy records of flare energies based on seps in principle may offer the longest time base to study infrequent large events . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that one suggested proxy , nitrate concentrations in polar ice cores , does not map reliably to sep events . </S>",
    "<S> concentrations of select radionuclides measured in natural archives may prove useful in extending the time interval of direct observations up to ten millennia , but as their calibration to solar flare fluences depends on multiple poorly known properties and processes , these proxies can not presently be used to help determine the flare energy frequency distribution . </S>",
    "<S> being thus limited to the use of direct flare observations , we evaluate the probabilities of large - energy solar explosions by combining solar flare observations with an ensemble of stellar flare observations . </S>"
