    "@xcite ( 1994 ) extended the study of star formation activities of spiral galaxies by @xcite ( 1983 ) , and showed that the ratio of the current star formation rate ( sfr ) to the average past sfr increases as the morphological type becomes later , from 0.01 in sa to 1 in sc .",
    "they used the integrated h@xmath3  equivalent width ( ew ) as an indicator of star formation activity .",
    "their samples were about 200 galaxies , in which galaxies having active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or interacting companions were not included .",
    "on the other hand , far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity of spiral galaxies is considered to be another indicator of the current sfr",
    ". a luminosity function of 60 @xmath6 m emission obtained by the _",
    "iras _ is similar for galaxies from sa to scd ( @xcite 1991 ) .",
    "fir to optical @xmath0 band luminosity ratio , log(@xmath1 ) , has been used as an indicator of the present star formation activity of spiral galaxies by many researchers ( e.g. , @xcite 1984 , @xcite 1989 , @xcite 1996 , @xcite 1997 ) .",
    "@xcite ( 1996 ) constructed a histogram of log(@xmath1 )   for each morphological type , and showed that the distribution is rather flat from @xmath71.5 to 0.5 in early type spirals ( sa - sab ) , while it is much concentrated within 1 dex around @xmath70.5 in late type spirals ( sc ) .",
    "these suggest that there are many early type spirals with high star formation activities , in contrast with the result of @xcite ( 1994 ) .",
    "there is , however , a controversy over the origin of fir emission of spiral galaxies .",
    "fir emission generally consists of at least two components : a warm component from dust in star forming region and a cool component from diffuse interstellar dust , heated by the general interstellar radiation field ( e.g. , @xcite 1986 ) .",
    "@xcite ( 1990 ) investigated the relation between fir and h@xmath3  luminosity and showed that high - mass stars are responsible for the both luminosities .",
    "the morphological dependence of the ratio of fir to h@xmath3  luminosity was investigated by @xcite ( 1992 ) .",
    "their ratios systematically decrease from early to late type spirals , and they interpreted this trend as the decreasing contribution of cirrus component , from about 86% for sa galaxies to about 3% for sdm galaxies . @xcite ( 1990 ) analyzed intensities of uv ( at 2000  ) and fir emission for about 40 spirals , most of which are late type , and concluded that the cool component is dominantly due to the non - ionizing uv radiation from intermediate massive stars ( @xmath8 5 @xmath9 ) with lifetimes of the order of @xmath10 yr ( see also @xcite 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , there is a tight and universal correlation between the integrated fir and radio continuum emission , most of which is non - thermal , for various types of galaxies from sa to sm ( @xcite 1987 ) .",
    "the radio continuum is generated by the synchrotron radiation of cosmic ray electron , and cosmic rays are accelerated by supernova explosions , whose progenitor is also responsible for fir emission ( @xcite 1996 ) .",
    "this correlation further supports the notion that fir emission is a star formation indicator as well as h@xmath3  emission .",
    "the sample of early type spirals of @xcite ( 1983 ) and @xcite ( 1992 ) , on which @xcite ( 1992 ) and @xcite ( 1994 ) were based , is small in number and may be biased to the galaxies with low values of log(@xmath1 ) .",
    "@xcite ( 1991 ) studied star formation activities of sa galaxies , selected from the revised shapley - ames catalog ( @xcite 1987 ) .",
    "but most of their galaxies are weak in fir emission , i.e. , log(@xmath1 )  @xmath111.0 , and half of their sample are classified as earlier than sa in the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; @xcite 1991 ) . recently @xcite ( 1996 )",
    "presented the h@xmath3  emission line flux of spiral galaxies extensively , but the sample is still small in number for early type spirals with high values of log(@xmath1 ) .    in this study",
    "we make ccd imaging of the @xmath2 and h@xmath3  bands for 15 early type spirals with log(@xmath1 )  @xmath120.5 and investigate the properties of fir emission as an indicator of star formation activity by comparing with h@xmath3  emission .",
    "h@xmath3  emission originates exclusively from newly born massive stars , aside from agn , and connects directly with the present star formation activities , though the effect of the extinction remains uncertain .",
    "moreover the h@xmath3  images provide some insights about the distribution of star forming regions .",
    "we describe the sample selection , observations and data reduction in @xmath13  2 . in @xmath13",
    "3 , after comments on individual galaxies , we show that log(@xmath1 )   can be a star formation indicator comparable to h@xmath3  luminosity for early type spirals with higher star formation activities .",
    "we also show the trend of the central concentration of the star forming regions in the observed galaxies . in @xmath13  4",
    "we discuss the difference of star formation indicators between fir and h@xmath3  emission , and estimate a general distribution of h@xmath3  ew  of early type spirals .",
    "we also analyze the effect of galaxy - galaxy interactions on the star formation activities in early type spirals .",
    "a summary is given in @xmath13  5 .",
    "in this paper we refer early type spirals as galaxies with morphological types sa and sab , or @xmath14 for the index of the hubble sequence given in rc3 .",
    "we select early type spirals having @xmath15  and @xmath16  in rc3 and log(@xmath1 )  @xmath120.5 .",
    "the range of log(@xmath1 )  adopted here represents that the selected galaxies have log(@xmath1 )  higher than the average of early type spirals .",
    "the values of log(@xmath1 )  are computed using @xmath15  in rc3 and 60 @xmath17 m and 100 @xmath17 m flux densities of _ iras _ data in the same manner as that of @xcite ( 1996 ) .",
    "the fir luminosity , @xmath4 , in solar units is given by @xcite ( 1985 ) as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the distance in mpc , assuming @xmath20 = 75  km  s@xmath21  mpc@xmath21 , _ f_@xmath22 and _ f_@xmath23 are the flux densities at 60 @xmath17 m and 100 @xmath17 m in jy .",
    "following @xcite ( 1987 ) , the @xmath0 band luminosity , @xmath5 , in solar units is given as @xmath24 the additional criteria of our sample are as follows : they are ( 1 ) nearby galaxies with recession velocities 1000  km  s@xmath25 km  s@xmath21 , ( 2 ) at the declination range @xmath26@xmath27  @xmath28@xmath27  , ( 3 ) with optical diametars @xmath29  4.@xmath300 to secure sufficient sky area in each ccd image , ( 4 ) rather face - on with inclination @xmath31@xmath27  , which suffers less extinction in h@xmath3  luminosity ( @xcite 1996 ) , and ( 5 ) without seyfert activity . the sample selection is not related to the presense of a bar nor a sign of interaction , because our main purpose is to obtain the relation between h@xmath3  and fir emission of early type spirals as a whole .",
    "the complete sample consists of 15 galaxies , which are given in table  [ tbl-1 ] along with the properties .",
    "@xmath15  of the sample galaxies ranges from 11.5 to 13.6 .",
    "the range of optical diametars is from 10  kpc to 20  kpc , except for two small galaxies and one large galaxy .",
    "seven sample galaxies were previously identified as markarian or kiso ultraviolet excess galaxies ( kugs ) , as shown in the 15th column of table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "they are uv - bright and suggest higher star formaion activities .",
    "nuclear specta have been known to be the h  ii  region type for 8 our sample galaxies in the literature ( column 13 of table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "we also observed other 6 spiral galaxies regardless of morphological type for a comparison , h@xmath3  ews of which had been measured by other reserchers .",
    "these galaxies are listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] with the properties .",
    "ngc  681 is one of our sample galaxies , and the h@xmath3  ew  of the galaxy was measured by @xcite ( 1983 ) .",
    "so we use this galaxy as a comparison galaxy .",
    "the observations were made using a ccd camera ( thomson 7882 , 576 @xmath32 pixels ) attached to the cassegrain focus of the 0.6 m reflector ( focal length = 4.8 m ) at the ouda observatory , kyoto university ( @xcite 1992 ) between 1996 december and 1998 march .",
    "the scale was 1.@xmath330 per pixel and the field of view was 10@xmath30 @xmath34 6@xmath30 .",
    "seeing during the run was around 5@xmath33 . to measure h@xmath35[n  ii ]  emission line intensities , we observed each galaxy using two filters , i.e. , a narrow band filter ( @xmath36    , @xmath37    ) , which covers h@xmath35[n  ii ]  emission for galaxies with recession velocities between 1000  km  s@xmath21 and 3500  km  s@xmath21 , and a broad @xmath2 band filter with a band width of @xmath38 1000   , which gives the continuum intensity around the emission lines .",
    "the integration time for each frame was 2 to 4 min , and the total integration time of each object was 1 to 2 h in the narrow band and 10 to 20 min in the @xmath2 band .",
    "standard ccd reductions were performed using iraf .",
    "the images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using a frame of twilight sky .",
    "then the images were sky - subtracted , aligned and scaled using foreground stars , and median - combined to make the final image of each galaxy in the both narrow and @xmath2 band . to determine the continuum level ,",
    "the @xmath2 band image was scaled by the ratio of the count of the foreground stars of the @xmath2 band image to that of the narrow band image .",
    "the scaled @xmath2 band image was subtracted from the narrow band image , and the pure h@xmath35[n  ii ]  emission line image was yielded .",
    "we determined the continuum level with an error of around 5% .",
    "the uncertainty depended on mainly the number of forground stars in each image .",
    "we obtained the ew of h@xmath35[n  ii ]  emission lines as the ratio of the h@xmath35[n  ii ]  emission line flux to the continuum flux in the aperture which was taken from @xmath39 in rc3 .",
    "[ n  ii]/h@xmath3  ratio in the integrated light of each galaxy is considered to be similar from galaxy to galaxy ( @xcite 1983 ) .",
    "so we did not correct for the [ n  ii ]  emission , and hereafter we refer the ew of h@xmath35[n  ii ]  emission lines as h@xmath3  ew  or ew(h@xmath3 ) .",
    "the second column of table  [ tbl-3 ] shows the h@xmath3  ews with the uncertainties for the sample galaxies as well as the comparison galaxies .",
    "the uncertainties were derived in two ways ; one is from the statistics of the sky level and the scaling factor to determine the continuum level , and another is from the internal disagreement of different nights observations of the galaxy .",
    "in most cases the two uncertainties were comparable ; if they were significantly different , the larger value is listed in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "we estimated h@xmath35[n  ii ]  emission line flux , which hereafter we refer as @xmath40 , in the following manner .",
    "the @xmath2 magnitude has not given for most of the sample galaxies , but all of the observed galaxies have @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "first , we constructed the @xmath43 diagram by combining the data of @xmath44 in rc3 and @xmath45 in @xcite ( 1995 ) for mostly normal galaxies .",
    "then we estimated the @xmath2 magnitude from b@xmath46 and v@xmath46 , using the equation : @xmath47 .",
    "we converted the @xmath2 magnitude to the flux density , and assumed it to be the continuum flux density around the h@xmath3  line .",
    "@xmath40  was computed from h@xmath3  ew  and the flux density .",
    "h@xmath35[n  ii ]  luminosity in solar units , which hereafter we refer as @xmath48 , was also estimated after the correction for the galactic extinction .",
    "the galactic extinction in @xmath0 band , @xmath49 , in rc3 was converted to the extinction at h@xmath3  line , assuming @xmath50(h@xmath3)/@xmath49  =  0.61 .",
    "we did not correct for the internal extinction nor [ n  ii ]  emission .",
    "the estimated @xmath40  and @xmath48  are given in the third and fourth columns of table  [ tbl-3 ] , respectively .",
    "@xmath48  of the sample galaxies are of the order of @xmath51  @xmath52 .",
    "the data of @xcite ( 1997 ) showed that @xmath48  of liners are less than 2  @xmath34  10@xmath53  @xmath52  for all of the observed 28 , except one , early type spirals .",
    "so in our sample galaxies the contribution of liners , if any , is probably negligible in the @xmath48 .    we also measured half - light radii of the @xmath2 band continuum and h@xmath3   emission , @xmath54   and @xmath55 , respectively , to gauge the distribution of light within a galaxy .",
    "the half - light radii were defined such the radius that the circular aperture of @xmath54  ( @xmath55 ) encompasses a half of the total flux of @xmath2 ( h@xmath3 ) band light of the galaxy .",
    "the measurements on the different nights imagings of each galaxy agree quite well .",
    "we calculated the ratio of @xmath55  to @xmath56 and the ratio of @xmath55  to @xmath54 , where @xmath56 is the optical radius of the galaxy and equal to a half of @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath55/@xmath56 indicates the degree of the concentration of h@xmath3  emission relative to the optical size of the galaxy , and @xmath55/@xmath54  indicates the degree of the concentration of h@xmath3  emission relative to the continuum light .",
    "we tabulate @xmath55  in kpc , @xmath55/@xmath56 , and @xmath55/@xmath54  in the last three columns of table  [ tbl-3 ] .",

    "parent interstellar matter removes from young massive stars with time , the intensities of fir emission reduce , and the h  ii  regions become apparent .",
    "so @xmath48  begins to grow later than @xmath4  and is increasing even at the phase that log(@xmath1 )  is decreasing .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ f4 ] suggests that in our sample galaxies the more active star formation occurs in the more concentrated region .",
    "this concentration may also affect the value of log(@xmath4/@xmath48 ) .",
    "in figure  [ f6 ] we plot log(@xmath4/@xmath48 )  and @xmath55/@xmath54  for our sample early type spirals ( filled circles ) and a comparison early type spiral ( open circle ) .",
    "although the correlation between the two parameters is marginal , there is a weak trend that the higher central concentration ( i.e. , lower @xmath55 /@xmath54 ) leads to the higher log(@xmath4/@xmath48 ) .",
    "the extinction for h@xmath3  emission possibly becomes higher towards the galactic centers .",
    "the value of log(@xmath4/@xmath48 )  thus depends on both the phase of the star formation and the extinction for early type spirals with higher star formation activities , and the both effects yield the non - linearity and the relatively large scatter of the correlation between @xmath4/@xmath5  and h@xmath3  ew  in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "@xcite ( 1996 ) made a universal histogram of log(@xmath1 )  for each morphological type .",
    "we divide h@xmath3  ew  into three ranges : 0  -  10  , 10  -  20  , and over 20  . for early type",
    "spirals the range of ew(h@xmath3 )  = 10  -  20   corresponds to log(@xmath1 )  @xmath700.47 to 0 , and the range of ew(h@xmath3 )  @xmath58 20    corresponds to log(@xmath1 )  @xmath58 0 , from equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the universal histogram of log(@xmath1 )  by @xcite ( 1996 ) indicates that the relative frequency of the two ranges of h@xmath3  ew  are , respectively , 17% and 29% for early type spirals . because of the scatter of the relation between h@xmath3  ew  and @xmath4/@xmath5 , the conversion of h@xmath3  ew  to log(@xmath1 )   may not be so straightforward , and this estimation is rather crude .",
    "these values suggest , however , that the star formation activity of early type spirals is low [ ew(h@xmath3 )  @xmath63 10  ] for half or somewhat more galaxies , and the star formation activity is modest or strong [ ew(h@xmath3 )  @xmath71 20  ] for about 30% of early type spirals .",
    "the star formation activity of early type spirals as a whole is lower than that of late type spirals , h@xmath3  ews of which are around 30    ( @xcite 1983 ) , but the difference is not so large as @xcite ( 1994 ) showed . the sample which they used is biased to the galaxies with log(@xmath1)@xmath720.5 ( see figure  [ f3 ] ) , while the average of log(@xmath1 )  is @xmath73 for early type spirals .",
    "galaxy - galaxy interactions are considered to be an important triggering mechanism for starburst galaxies ( see a review by @xcite 1992 ) . both the integrated h@xmath3  emission and the fir emission",
    "are systematically enhanced in the strongly interacting systems like galaxies in the atlas of peculiar galaxies ( @xcite 1966 ) , but enhancements are subtle for nearby pair galaxies ( @xcite , 1987 ) .",
    "we examine the relation between interactions and star formation activities in nearby early type spirals by the same method as that of @xcite ( 1985 ) .",
    "we assume that the tidal force is proportional to @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the masses of the parent galaxy and its companion , respectively , and @xmath77 is the spatial separation between the galaxies .",
    "we use the @xmath0 band luminosity instead of the mass of the galaxy .",
    "we also assume that the amount of energy exchanged in the encounter is proportional to @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the relative velocity between the pair members .",
    "we can practically know only the projected spatial distance , @xmath80 , and the velocity difference along the line of sight , @xmath81 .",
    "so we define the interaction parameter ( ip ) by @xmath82 here @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the @xmath0 band luminosity of the companion and the parent galaxy , respectively . if @xmath83 is unknown , we assumed the mass is proportional to @xmath85 , where @xmath39 is the optical diameter in rc3 . in this case",
    "ip is defined by @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are @xmath39 given in rc3 of the companion and the parent galaxy , respectively . in this case",
    ", ip is identical to q@xmath30 in @xcite ( 1985 ) .",
    "ips derived by above equations are the upper limits in the sense that we adopt the minimum values of @xmath79 and @xmath77 .",
    "we searched for companion galaxies within the radius of 10@xmath88 and redshift difference less than 1000 km  s@xmath21 in rc3 , and calculated ip for each companion galaxy .",
    "if there were two or more companion galaxies in the searched space , we adopted the largest value of ip among ips calculated for each host - companion galaxy pair .",
    "ips were derived for 87 early type spirals with @xmath15  @xmath63 12  mag in rc3 and for our sample galaxies .",
    "the distributions are shown as a function of log(@xmath1 )  in figure  7(a ) and 7(b ) , respectively . in these diagrams we adopted ip = @xmath75 for galaxies without any companion galaxy .",
    "the galaxies with cross in both diagrams of figure  [ f7 ] are classified as peculiar in rc3 .",
    "the peculiar galaxies are considered to have high ip and high log(@xmath1 ) ; a peculiarity connects with both the presense of companion galaxies and enhanced star formation . in figure",
    "[ f7 ] , however , the relation between ip and log(@xmath1 )  is random on the whole , and there are star forming early type spirals with neither companion nor peculiarity .",
    "there is no companion galaxy for more than half of our sample galaxies as shown in figure  7(b ) .",
    "we conclude that interactions are not responsible for all of the star formation activities of early type spirals .",
    "on the other hand , bar structures may enhance star formation activities in early type spirals to some extent .",
    "@xcite ( 1996 ) showed that log(@xmath1 )  of barred galaxies ( sb ) is systematically higher than that of un- and weakly - barred galaxies ( sa and sab ) only for early type spirals ( s0/a - sbc ) .",
    "but the relation between @xmath55/@xmath54  and log(@xmath1 )  is similar regardless of the presence of bars or companion galaxies ( see figure  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "further observations are needed to fully understand the star formation mechanism(s ) of early type spirals .",
    "@xcite ( 1994 ) used h@xmath3  ew  as an indicator of the present star formation activities and showed that star formation activities of early type spirals are lower than those of late type spirals by a factor of 100 . on the other hand , @xcite ( 1996 ) used log(@xmath1 )  as an indicator of star formation activities , constructed the histogram of log(@xmath1 )  of each morphological type , and suggested that there are many early type spirals with high star formation activities .",
    "in order to solve the inconsistency , we made h@xmath3  imaging observation of the complete sample of 15 early type spirals with higher log(@xmath1 )  than the average of the type , and have obtained the following conclusions .    1 .",
    "we have compared log(@xmath1 )  and log[ew(h@xmath3 ) ] of early type spirals for 30 early type spirals consisting of our sample and @xcite s ( 1983 , 1992 ) sample , and obtained the correlation that @xmath4/@xmath5  increases with increasing h@xmath3  ew .",
    "log(@xmath1 )  can be a star formation indicator for early type spirals with star formation activities higher than the average .    2 .  for the early type spirals observed by us ,",
    "the extended h  ii   regions exist at the central regions with some asymmetric features .",
    "additional h@xmath3  emission is seen on the ends of a bar or a ring for some barred or ringed galaxies . even in such cases , it is at the central region that the star formation takes place most intensely .",
    "emission is more concentrated to the galactic center than the @xmath2 band light , and the degree of the concentration increases as the star formation activity is higher .",
    "we have found that log(@xmath4/@xmath48 )  tends to increase with increasing of both the activity and the central concentration of the star formation for galaxies with log(@xmath1 )  @xmath89 .",
    "these features are interpreted as the composite effects of the extinction and the phase of the star formation .",
    "these effects yield the non - linearity and scatter in the correlation between @xmath4/@xmath5  and h@xmath3  ew .",
    "only about half of our sample galaxies have companion galaxies .",
    "there is no correlation between star formation activities and the degree of the interaction for early type spirals brighter than 12  mag as well as our sample galaxies .",
    "this implies that the galaxy interaction is not responsible for all of the star formation activities of early type spirals .",
    "we would like to thank yuuji yamamoto , yoshio tomita , taichi kato and tsuyoshi ishigaki for their help with the observations .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contact with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
