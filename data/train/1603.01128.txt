    "the basic variables of loop gravity are an @xmath0 connection @xmath1 and a densitized triad @xmath2 . these are related to the traditional adm phase - space variables  the spatial metric and extrinsic curvature @xmath3  by @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the inverse of @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the spin connection determined by the triad @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the barbero - immirzi parameter@xcite , which usually is fixed through considerations of black hole entropy@xcite .",
    "we seek a condition on these variables equivalent to homogeneity and isotropy that is nevertheless _",
    "diffeomorphism invariant_. an initial data set @xmath11 is homogeneous and isotropic if and only if @xmath12 is _ maximally symmetric _  that is , possesses six killing vector fields  and @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath12 by a constant : @xmath14 it is well known that if @xmath12 is maximally symmetric , then its riemann curvature has the form @xmath15 where the scalar curvature @xmath16 is constant over space .",
    "in fact , the converse is also true @xcite .",
    "it follows that a spacetime admits a foliation by maximally symmetric spatial slices if and only if it admits initial data satisfying @xmath17 for some constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the curvature of @xmath8 and @xmath21 .",
    "the two conditions ( [ triadsymm ] ) can be combined in a useful form for quantization using the complexifier method of thiemann @xcite . fixing a complexifier function @xmath22 on phase space",
    ", one defines a 1-parameter family @xmath23 of complex functions @xmath24 on phase space deriving from a given ( generally real - valued ) function @xmath25 .",
    "importantly , the corresponding family of operators in the quantum theory will have the form @xmath26 , so in principle it is straightforward to quantize such complexified observables .",
    "choosing @xmath22 to be proportional to the total volume @xmath27 of space and setting @xmath28 yields a complexified connection @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant with units of inverse length .",
    "the ( co-)triad @xmath31 is invariant under this complexification flow . calculating the curvature of this complexified connection shows that the real and imaginary parts of the single relation @xmath32 where we have set @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a complex constant , imply _ both _ of the real symmetry conditions ( [ triadsymm ] ) .",
    "furthermore , taking a wedge product with @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an arbitrary smearing function , and integrating over all space gives @xmath37 : = \\int f_{ij}\\ , \\mathbf{f}^i \\wedge e^j          = \\mathbf{b } \\int f_{ij}\\ , \\delta^{ij}\\ , \\epsilon_{klm}\\ , e^k\\ , e^l\\ , e^m = : \\mathbf{b}\\ , v[f].\\ ] ] the right side here is proportional to the proper - volume integral of the trace of @xmath36 over all space .",
    "cross - multiplying two such equations allows us to eliminate the constant @xmath34 and write the symmetry conditions in the form @xmath38 : = \\mathbf{b}[f]\\ , v[g ] - \\mathbf{b}[g]\\ , v[f ] = 0\\ ] ] for all @xmath36 and @xmath39 .",
    "the non - complexified version of @xmath40 $ ] is nearly identical to the euclidean self - dual hamiltonian constraint of general relativity , which arises when @xmath41 .",
    "it can be quantized using the same basic method used for the euclidean hamiltonian constraint .",
    "finally , we can complexify the result in the quantum theory by setting @xmath42 : = \\mathrm{e}^{-\\hat v / v_0}\\ , \\hat b[f]\\ , \\mathrm{e}^{\\hat v / v_0},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is an fixed , but arbitrary , constant with units of volume .    the functions in equation ( [ sdef ] ) are our constraints , whose vanishing is equivalent to homogeneity and isotropy of the gravitational field with respect to _ some _ action of a maximal symmetry group .",
    "they are manifestly diffeomorphism and gauge covariant , so that their vanishing for _ all _ test functions is a diffeomorphism and gauge _ invariant _ condition .",
    "a necessary condition for a given set @xmath44 of classical constraints to admit operator analogues @xmath45 that can be imposed strongly ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath46 ) and consistently ( _ i.e. _ , simultaneously ) at the quantum level is that their classical poisson algebra should close .",
    "that is , there should exist phase - space functions @xmath47 such that @xmath48 we refer to such constraints as a _ first - class set_.    we wish to impose the symmetry conditions @xmath49 $ ] discussed above strongly in quantum theory , as well as the gauss and diffeomorphism constraints @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 $ ] of general relativity .",
    "remarkably , these functions _ do _ form a first class set classically .",
    "the first thing to check is that the symmetry conditions form a first class set by themselves .",
    "one finds @xmath52 , \\mathbf{s}[h , k ] \\bigr\\ }           & = \\frac{\\kappa\\gamma}{2}\\ , v[g]\\ , \\mathbf{s}[f { \\mathop{\\#}}h , k ]               + \\frac{\\kappa\\gamma}{2}\\ , \\mathbf{s}[g , k ] \\int \\operatorname{tr}f\\ , e^k                   \\wedge \\mathbf{d } \\bigl ( h_{kl}\\ , e^l \\bigr )              \\\\&\\hspace{10em}\\notag              - ( f \\leftrightarrow g )               - ( h \\leftrightarrow k )              + ( fh \\leftrightarrow gk ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 denotes the gauge - covariant derivative defined by @xmath54 , and where we have defined the `` hash product '' @xmath55 of smearing functions . the next thing to check is the algebra of the symmetry conditions and the constraints .",
    "one finds immediately that @xmath56 , \\mathbf{s}[f , g ] \\bigr\\ } = 0      \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad      \\bigl\\ { c[\\vec n ] , \\mathbf{s}[f , g ] \\bigr\\ }           = \\mathbf{s}[\\mathcal{l}_{\\vec n } f , g ] + \\mathbf{s}[f , \\mathcal{l}_{\\vec n } g]\\ ] ] because @xmath57 $ ] is ( gauss ) gauge - invariant and diffeomorphism - covariant .",
    "the total algebra of symmetry conditions and constraints therefore closes .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to seek a sector of ( distributional ) states in loop quantum gravity lying simultaneously in the kernels of all the symmetry condition operators , as well as all the gauss and diffeomorphism constraint operators .",
    "to construct an operator corresponding to the smeared constraint function @xmath49 $ ] ( [ sdef ] ) , one first constructs operators corresponding to @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 $ ] in ( [ bvdef ] ) .",
    "this is a simple task in the framework of loop quantum gravity .",
    "first , the standard quantization of the volume element given in ref .   yields a canonical definition for @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "second , as we mentioned above , @xmath58 $ ] has a form closely related to that of the euclidean self - dual hamiltonian constraint @xmath61 =   \\int n f^i \\wedge e_i , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the curvature of @xmath1 . specifically ,",
    "@xmath58 $ ] differs only in that ( a ) the two indices are no longer contracted with each other , but rather with those of a matrix - valued smearing function , and ( b ) one uses the complexified connection @xmath63 instead of the real connection @xmath1 .",
    "neither of these differences affect thiemann s procedure @xcite for quantizing @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "exactly the same methods can be used to define an operator @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "one can either carry out the thiemann strategy using the quantum complexified connection directly , or first using the quantum real connection and then complexifying as in ( [ complexifyb ] )",
    ". the resulting operator in either case will be the same due to the structure of quantum complexification .",
    "there is a further subtlety to be addressed , even with @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath66 $ ] constructed . as in the case of thiemann",
    "s hamiltonian constraint , the operator @xmath65 $ ] has a well - defined action only within the space of solutions @xmath67 to the quantum diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "furthermore , as with thiemann s constraint ( when it is smeared with a non - constant lapse ) , @xmath65 $ ] maps diffeomorphism - invariant states out of @xmath67 .",
    "that is , its domain and range are mutually exclusive .",
    "in contrast , the smeared volume operator @xmath66 $ ] is well - defined on _ all _ states , diffeomorphism invariant or not , but generally maps diffeomorphism - invariant states out of @xmath67 .",
    "these facts determine the operator ordering to use when building the operators @xmath68 $ ] analogous to ( [ sdef ] ) .",
    "namely , if we choose the domain of @xmath68 $ ] to be @xmath67 , then we must order @xmath65 $ ] to act before @xmath69 $ ] , and likewise @xmath70 $ ] to act before @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "the space of states annihilated by @xmath71 $ ] for all smearing functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 then defines our _ homogeneous and isotropic sector _",
    "the gauss and diffeomorphism constraints hold identically in loop quantum cosmology , and also in the new homegeneous and isotropic sector of loop quantum gravity described above . the only remaining constraint is the ( lorentzian ) hamiltonian constraint @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , there is only one independent smearing of the hamiltonian constraint that needs to be imposed in the homogeneous and isotropic context , which can be taken to be the unit - lapse smearing @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "there exists a quantum analogue of @xmath76 $ ] in both loop quantum cosmology and loop quantum gravity , which we denote @xmath77 and @xmath78 $ ] , respectively .",
    "one of the key aims of our program is to give a direct relation between these two operators at the quantum level .",
    "this part of our program remains incomplete , but the general strategy we intend to follow is to construct an embedding @xmath79 of lqc states into @xmath80 such that , at least in an approximate sense , the matrix elements of the two hamiltonian constraint operators match : @xmath81 \\iota \\phi \\rangle } { \\sqrt{\\langle \\iota \\psi , \\iota \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\iota \\phi , \\iota \\phi \\rangle } }   =   \\frac{\\langle \\psi , \\hat{c}_s \\phi \\rangle } { \\sqrt{\\langle \\psi , \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\phi , \\phi \\rangle}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this condition should hold for all lqc states @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the division by the norms here is needed because @xmath79 will in general not be norm - preserving , so that @xmath83 , @xmath82 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 will in general not be simultaneously normalizable . the extent to which the above condition can be satisfied for some @xmath79 is then a measure of the extent to which the two definitions of dynamics are consistent .",
    "alternatively , @xmath79 can be determined by imposing a similar equality of matrix elements for one or more pairs of simpler operators .",
    "then , given an operator @xmath78 $ ] in the full theory , equation ( [ matel ] ) will uniquely determine a corresponding operator in lqc , which can then be compared with the hamiltonian constraint operator used in the lqc literature .",
    "in practice , the above prescriptions are more involved than they sound , as @xmath80 is expected to consist in states which are not normalizable in the diffeomorphism invariant inner product on @xmath67@xcite , so that the left hand side of the above equation will likely be of the form @xmath86 and so will need to be regularized .",
    "we refer to the larger paper @xcite for such details .",
    "even though the program of section [ dynamics ] has not been carried to completion in relating the full theory of lqg to lqc , it _ has _",
    "been completed@xcite to impose isotropy at the quantum level in a bianchi i model @xcite .",
    "this is a simpler , but still non - trivial , problem .",
    "this application allows a detailed comparison of the isotropy - reduced quantum dynamics of bianchi i @xcite with that of the well - established isotropic lqc model @xcite .",
    "the results were unexpected .",
    "we found an exact match of kinematics and dynamics in the two theories , as well as an exact match of naturally defined operators in each model corresponding to spatial volume , average spatial curvature , and hubble rate .",
    "furthermore , the embedding @xmath79 in this application to bianchi i turned out to be none other than the adjoint of the dynamical projector @xmath87 from bianchi i to isotropic lqc proposed by ashtekar and wilson - ewing in ref .  .",
    "that is , the image of the adjoint of their dynamical projector satisfies precisely the symmetry constraint operator equation proposed in this paper , specialized to bianchi i in a straightforward way .",
    "if one includes scalar matter in the analysis , all of the above statements are again true , as long as the matter hamiltonian depends on the geometry only via the volume , as is the case for the matter considered in ref .  .",
    "in light of the successful application to bianchi i , and of the equivalence to the t is dynamical projector method of ref .   in that case , one can view the present program as way to reformulate the dynamical projector method and generalize it to the full theory of lqg .",
    "what makes this possible is the sharpened understanding of the role of homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "a further benefit of the application to bianchi i is that , in matching operators in the two models , such as those corresponding to spatial curvature and hubble rate , the ambiguity in how the operators are quantized is necessarily restricted .",
    "if one similarly tries to match operators corresponding to , for example , components of the four dimensional ricci tensor , one again expects a preferred class of quantizations to be selected .",
    "it is worth checking whether the use of such quantizations of ricci might resolve the issue of apparent non - zero ricci components in vacuum discussed in ref .  .",

    "<S> , however , immediately runs into two obstacles :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> symmetry must be imposed on the full set of initial data  both configuration and momentum variables . </S>",
    "<S> classically this is necessary for the future evolution to continue to be symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the quantum level , this violates the heisenberg uncertainty principle . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> usually symmetry is imposed by requiring invariance of the initial data under a fixed action of the symmetry group . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a method of imposing symmetry necessarily breaks the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity . as a consequence , in the quantum theory , such a method of imposing symmetry will never be consistent with imposition of the dynamical constraints .    in this paper </S>",

    "<S> specifically , we formulate new _ diffeomorphism covariant _ constraints that impose homogeneity and isotropy in the phase space of general relativity . </S>",

    "<S> some steps of our program to relate a symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity to loop quantum cosmology remain incomplete , however . </S>",
    "<S> we will summarize the steps that have been completed below , and mention those that are the subject of ongoing work . </S>",
    "<S> we have , however , completed the analogous task relating the loop quantum bianchi i model of ashtekar and wilson - ewing @xcite to homogeneous and isotropic loop quantum cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we were surprised to find that the homogeneous and isotropic model could be embedded in the bianchi i model using a known linear mapping . </S>",
