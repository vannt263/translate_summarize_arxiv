    "scalable video coding with spatial , temporal and amplitude scalability offers video servers and clients the flexibility in choosing appropriate video layers according to the network bandwidth and the user perference . given a bandwidth constraint , the spatial resolution ( controlled by frame size ) , temporal resolution ( controlled by frame rate ) and amplitude resolution ( controlled by quantization parameter ) ,",
    "can be adjusted such that the optimal perceptual quality can be achieved . however",
    ", scalable coding has not been widely adopted in commercial applications so far because of the complexity of scalable coding and the reduced coding efficiency compared to single layer coding .",
    "most of the existing video streaming architectures uses multiple copies of single layer coded videos at different star s , and the system will send a version coded at a particular star based on the network condition .",
    "it is interesting and useful to see whether there are any quality differences between single - layer and scalable videos coded at the same star . in  @xcite@xcite , we have investigated the impact of star on the perceptual quality , and derived a model relating the perceptual quality with the star",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether the same model is also applicable to non - scalable video .    in this work ,",
    "we report results from subjective tests that compare the perceived quality between single - layer and scalable video , when coded at the same star combination .",
    "we design our subjective tests based on the paired comparison methods  @xcite .",
    "we conduct the test on a mobile platform with a 4.1-inch wvga ( 854@xmath0480 ) touch screen running the android os .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : interface ] introduces the test interface , the test video pool and test methodology .",
    "section [ sec : result ] shows and analyzes the subjective test result .",
    "we conclude this work in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the subjective tests are conducted on the ti s zoom2 mobile development platform equipped with a 4.1-inch wvga multi - touch screen .",
    "our approach for designing the interface is using the android s own video playback library ( android sdk ) , while using java and xml to control the high - level program flow . for details on the user interface design , please see  @xcite .",
    "three videos , _ city _ , _ soccer _ , and _ foreman _ from the standard test video database are used in the test .",
    "all videos are originally at 4cif ( 704@xmath0576 ) spatial resolution with a frame rate of 30hz , and each sequence is 8-second long ( 240 frames ) . a sine - windowed sinc function , which is the recommended downsampling filter in h.264/svc standard   @xcite , is used for generating videos at spatial resolutions of cif and qcif . the jsvm 9.18  @xcite encoder is used to generate both single - layer and layered video .",
    "the gop size is 16 frames in all cases .",
    "we investigate the effect of scalable coding in each dimension ( i.e. spatial , temporal , or amplitude scalability ) separately , while fixing the resolutions of the other two dimensions at the highest . specifically , to examine the effect of spatial scalability",
    ", we code all videos at highest temporal and amplitude resolution ( fr=30hz , qp=28 ) . to create non - scalable video at different sr s",
    ", we code pre - downsampled input videos at qcif , cif , and 4cif resolutions separately , using the jsvm encoder at the single layer mode .",
    "to create scalable videos , we create a three layer bitsteam using the jsvm encoder invoking only the spatial scalability , using qcif as the base layer . for temporal scalability",
    ", we fix sr at 4cif and qp at 28 , and produce temporally scalable videos by using the jsvm encoder with the hierarchical b temporal prediction structure , with the base layer corresponding to 3.75 hz , and additional enhancement layers leading to 7.5 , 15 , and 30 hz , respectively .",
    "the non - scalable versions are created by coding the pre - downsampled input video at 7.5 , 15 , and 30 hz video at the non - scalable mode using the i15bp structure , with only the first frame coded at i mode .",
    "thus , the temporal scalable videos at lower frame rate have higher i / p - frame ratio then the corresponding single - layer videos .",
    "no qp cascading is used when temporal and spatial scalability is invoked .",
    "finally , to test amplitude scalability ( commonly known as quality or snr scalability ) , coarse gratitude scalability ( cgs ) is used with base layer qp at 44 , additional layers using qp at 36 and 28 , respectively .",
    "for single - layer counterpart , we directly code the video at each qp ( to be specific , qp at 28 , 36 and 44 individually ) .",
    "table  [ t : testpts ] summarizes the test points examined in different cases .",
    ".test points [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ fig : pvs2 ]    table  [ t : res1 ] provides the counting result for the 2-forced - choice test .",
    "as we mentioned in section [ sec : meth ] , the 2-forced - choice test can be seen as a special case of jnd test .",
    "if the hypothesis that there is a `` _ _ just noticeable _ _ '' difference on the perceived quality is accepted , the winning frequency for the better quality one should be at least above @xmath1 under the @xmath1 jnd condition , that is at least 15 votes for a particular video at a particular star combination , since each video pair is viewed 20 times . from table  [ t : res1 ] , except _ city _ at qp44/30hz/4cif , there is no such occurrence .",
    "thus it s safe to say that there is no significant difference in the perceptual quality between the scalable and single - layer video at all star s examined .    to further examine the statistical significance of the rating differences , we conducted an anova analysis in the three dimensions separately and the results are shown in table  [ t : anova ] .",
    "for all the cases , the @xmath2-values are larger than @xmath3 , indicating that there are no significant differences between videos coded in single - layer and scalable modes .",
    "we also show the box plots of the anova tests in fig .  [",
    "f : anova ] . in the box plots ,",
    "the central red mark is the median of the data , the notches in the box represent the 95% confidence interval of the median , the edges of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles and the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points .",
    "we find that the @xmath4 confidence interval of medians are overlapped , indicating there is no perceived quality difference between single - layer and scalable coded videos .",
    "table  [ t : res2 ] shows the counting result for the 3-forced - choice test .",
    "we see that in most cases , the majority of votes are given to the `` tie '' option , indicating the viewers could not tell the difference between the single - layer and scalable coded video at the same star .",
    "this paper reports results from a perceptual quality assessment comparing single - layer video and scalable video , when coded at the same spatial , temporal and amplitude resolutions ( star ) .",
    "the subjective test was conducted using paired comparison with and without `` tie '' option and double rating .",
    "ten subjects data were collected for the _ without `` tie '' _ option , and 6 subjects ratings for the _ with `` tie '' _ option .",
    "the test result shows that under the same star there is no significant perceptual quality difference between single layer coded video and scalable one , both by observing the ratings and through using the anova test .",
    "although the single - layer and scalable videos are generated using the h.264/avc and h.264/svc compliant codecs , respectively ( both implemented via the jsvm encoder under different settings ) , we believe the conclusion may be generally true for any videos coded at the same star , regardless the encoding method . note here we measure the amplitude resolution by the inverse of quantization stepsize .",
    "we consider the two videos as having the same amplitude resolution if they are quantized using the same type of quantizer and at the same quantization stepsize .",
    "one important consequence of our finding here is that the q - star model developed in our prior work  @xcite modeling the perceptual quality as a function of star is applicable to both scalable and non - scalable video ."
