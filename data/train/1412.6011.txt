    "in this paper , @xmath0 denotes a positive integer that is destined to be factored .",
    "when @xmath0 is large and free of small factors , the most efficient publicly known algorithm for determining its factors is the number field sieve  @xcite .",

    "the number field sieve is comprised of several stages , commonly referred to as polynomial selection , sieving , filtering , linear algebra and square root computation .",
    "the polynomial selection stage requires the selection of coprime irreducible polynomials @xmath1 $ ] that have a common root modulo @xmath0 .",

    "for example , the two largest factorisations of rsa moduli  @xcite both used a sextic polynomial together with a linear polynomial . to quantify the coefficient size of a polynomial",
    ", the skewed @xmath20-norm @xmath21 is used .",
    "the norm is defined as follows : if @xmath22 is a degree  @xmath23 polynomial with real coefficients , then @xmath24 the parameter @xmath25 captures the shape of the sieve region , which is modelled by a rectangular region @xmath26\\times(0,b]$ ] or an elliptic region @xmath27 such that @xmath28 . in practice , the polynomial selection stage proceeds by first generating many `` raw '' polynomial pairs with small coefficients",
    ". then various methods of optimisation  @xcite are used to improve the quality of the raw pairs by taking into account additional factors that influence a pair s yield of relations , such as the presence of real roots and roots modulo small primes  @xcite .",
