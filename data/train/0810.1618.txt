    "the making and breaking of oil - water emulsions is not only a problem of extreme importance in chemical , oil , pharmaceutical , food , and cosmetics industries , but is also a scientifically fascinating topic .",
    "it is well - known that the intrinsic tendency of oil and water to demix can be slowed - down or delayed by adding surfactants or colloidal particles to the mixture .",
    "these additives strongly adsorb to the oil - water interface , which lowers the interfacial tension ( the main driving force for demixing ) and/or provides a kinetic barrier that prevents droplet coalescence @xcite .",
    "recently however , it was observed that emulsions of water droplets dispersed in somewhat polar oils can be stable for a long time ( so far for more than 18 months ) , _ without any additives _ @xcite .",
    "moreover , the water droplets , which are of micrometer dimensions in these experiments , spontaneously form crystalline structures with lattice spacings of the order of @xmath0 @xmath1 m .",
    "these observations suggest long - ranged electrostatic droplet - droplet repulsions due to a net water droplet charge stemming from a preferential uptake of ions from the oil @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations based on poisson - boltzmann theory for monovalent ions in the geometry of a planar water - oil interface showed that the order of magnitude of the charge separation process , caused by the different cationic and anionic born self - energies in oil and water , is indeed sufficiently strong to explain the observed stability and crystallization @xcite , at least qualitatively . these predictions are based on the assumption of a pairwise screened - coulomb potential of the charged water droplets through the oil , and an explicit empirical crystallization condition based on simulations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will explore the ionic charge separation at the planar oil - water interface and the resulting crystallization regime of water droplets dispersed in oil in the high - dimensional parameter space of salt concentration , dielectric constant of the oil , ionic sizes and self - energies , droplet size , and droplet concentration .",
    "the analytic solution admitted by the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann equation in the planar geometry @xcite allows for such a detailed exploration efficiently ; the effects of droplet curvature were recently studied numerically @xcite .",
    "we will find that crystallization of water droplets is only possible for sufficiently large droplet radii ( @xmath2 nm ) , sufficiently large water content ( volume fraction @xmath3 ) , and sufficiently ( but not too ) polar oils with dielectric constants between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "in addition we will also give an explicit expression for the change of the interfacial tension between oil and water due to the ionic segregation over the two media .",
    "this change is found to be negative , proportional to the square - root of the ionic strength , and small on the scale of the bare oil - water tension , at least within the present model .",
    "we will discuss the sensitivity of these findings to details of the interfacial structure as described recently in @xcite .",
    "the liquids are considered as structureless homogeneous linear dielectric media , filling the two half spaces @xmath6 ( water ) and @xmath7 ( oil ) , forming a flat interface at @xmath8 .",
    "the relative dielectric constant is a step function , @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the grand potential functional per unit area of the variational density profiles @xmath13 of the cations @xmath14 and anions @xmath15 in units of @xmath16 is given by @xcite @xmath17 = \\sum \\limits_{\\alpha = \\pm } \\int \\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } { \\mathrm{d}}z\\ \\rho_\\alpha(z ) \\big(\\ln\\frac{\\rho_\\alpha(z)}{\\rho_\\mathrm{w } } - 1 + \\beta v_\\alpha(z ) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2 } \\phi(z,[\\rho_\\pm])\\big),\\ ] ] with the self - consistent dimensionless electrostatic potential @xmath18)$ ] , and with the external potential acting on the ions @xmath19 representing the born self - energy and an additional specific solvation energy @xmath20 ( e.g. due to hydration , hydrogen bonding , local modification of dielectric constant @xcite ) , which is set either to @xmath21 or to 4 here in order to study specific effects .",
    "the salt concentration in bulk water is denoted by @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the elementary charge , and @xmath24 is the ionic radius . both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are gauged to zero in the bulk water phase ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1 ] shows @xmath28 as a function of the oil dielectric constant @xmath29 , and ionic radius @xmath24 ( inset ) , for @xmath30 .",
    "typical values for the self - energies are @xmath31 @xmath32 , and self - energy differences are of the order of @xmath33 @xmath32 for ionic radii differing by , say , 1  .",
    "minimization of the functional ( [ fml : grandpotentialfunctional ] ) with respect to @xmath34 , together with the poisson equation , yields @xmath35 which can be rewritten as the poisson - boltzmann equation @xmath36 subject to the neumann boundary conditions @xmath37 which are dictated by the vanishing of the electric displacement field in the bulk and its continuity at the interface .",
    "the donnan potential of the bulk oil is @xmath38 , the inverse debye screening lengths are given by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the bulk salt concentration in oil satisfies @xmath41 .",
    "the general solution of ( [ fml : pb ] ) is @xmath42 with integration constants that follow from the boundary conditions ( [ fml : boundaryconditions ] ) as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the derivation so far is equivalently presented in @xcite . a separation of charge",
    "is found near the interface for unequal self - energies , comprising a cloud of net charge in the water phase of typical width @xmath46 and one in the oil phase of typical width @xmath47 , with a charge per area at the water side given in units of @xmath23 by @xmath48 the compensating charge resides at the oil side as the system is globally neutral . in section [ sec : yukawa ] we will assume that the surface charge density of a water droplet in oil is equal to @xmath49 in order to calculate the pair potential between the droplets .",
    "we now consider @xmath50 oil - dispersed water droplets of radius @xmath51 in a volume @xmath52 , such that the typical droplet - droplet separation is @xmath53 and the water volume fraction is @xmath54 .",
    "we assume that each water droplet has a charge @xmath55 , where @xmath49 follows from the nonlinear pb theory ( [ fml : sigmaw ] ) , and reconsider a screened coulomb ( yukawa ) potential between two droplets @xmath56 with @xmath57 the center - to - center separation between the droplets . according to simulation results , crystallization of such a yukawa system",
    "occurs if @xmath58 @xcite , with the coupling parameter @xmath59 defined by @xmath60 although this condition has been confirmed only for point - yukawa systems , it is expected to hold also for finite droplets as long as @xmath61 @xmath32 and @xmath62 , conditions that are easily met for micron - sized droplets , provided @xmath63 as can be seen in figure [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "the electrostatic contribution @xmath64 to the interfacial tension can be calculated analytically by evaluating the functional ( [ fml : grandpotentialfunctional ] ) with the equilibrium profiles , minus the functional evaluated with the step profile @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xcite . after a tedious but straightforward calculation",
    "we find @xmath67 which is symmetric under exchanging @xmath68 and where the proportionality to @xmath69 follows from @xmath70 and the fact that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are independent of @xmath22 .",
    "typical values of the excess interfacial tension are at most @xmath73(@xmath1n / m ) , and are therefore vanishingly small compared to the value of the bare oil - water interfacial tension ( @xmath73(10 mn / m ) ) .",
    "as standard parameters we use @xmath74 , @xmath75 m , which are close to the experimental values of @xcite , @xmath30 and @xmath76 nm . the surface charge density @xmath49 of the interface appears to be strongly dependent on the oil dielectric constant , keeping the ionic radii fixed .",
    "typically it is of the order of @xmath77 elementary charges per nm@xmath78 in the range @xmath79 , and decays rapidly to @xmath80 nm@xmath81 for @xmath82 , see figure [ fig : figure2](a ) .",
    "numerical calculations in the spherical geometry @xcite predict a smaller @xmath49 for oil - in - water droplets , and a larger one for water - in - oil droplets in the regime @xmath63 , as shown in figure [ fig : figure2](a ) for a radius @xmath83 @xmath1 m .",
    "the excess interfacial tension @xmath64 differs correspondingly for finite droplets , figure [ fig : figure2](b ) .",
    "the linearized pb theory that takes into account a finite interfacial width @xmath84 @xcite between oil and water agrees quantitatively with the present results for @xmath49 , indicating that the charge separation is hardly dependent on @xmath85(@xmath86 nm ) , even if the ions are effectively excluded in a band of several tenths of nanometers . on the other hand , above a certain crossover ionic strength , the same theory predicts a qualitatively different asymptotic behaviour of the excess interfacial tension , being positive and proportional to the ionic strength @xmath22 , figure [ fig : figure2](b ) .",
    "one can understand that as follows : whereas the charge separation is hardly affected by the interfacial width @xmath87 , the adsorption of particles , and hence the interfacial tension , is sensitive to the effective exclusion in a region of width @xmath87 .",
    "as the absolute value of the excess interfacial tension is vanishingly small compared to the bare oil - water interface , @xmath88 mn / m ) , @xmath64 will be considered not to contribute to the stability of the system of interest here .",
    "we expect that water droplets in oil can only form crystalline structures if long range interactions are present ( @xmath89 ) , and if the repulsion is sufficiently strong .",
    "figure [ fig : figure3 ] shows the yukawa potential ( [ fml : yukawa ] ) at contact , @xmath90 , for several droplet sizes as a function of @xmath29 , revealing that these two conditions already impose strong restrictions on the dielectric constant and size of the particles .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig : figure3 ] shows for instance that the screening length in oil decays from @xmath91 @xmath1 m at @xmath82 to 100 nm at @xmath92 , for @xmath93 mm , while the main part of figure [ fig : figure3 ] shows contact potentials that exceed @xmath5 @xmath32 for @xmath94 provided the droplet size is in the micron regime .",
    "thus one only expects crystallization to be possible for micron - sized water droplet in oils that are sufficiently polar ( @xmath95 ) to have enough charge ( see also figure [ fig : figure2](a ) ) , but not too polar ( @xmath96 ) to have a long enough range @xmath47 of the repulsions .",
    "this regime of @xmath29 is in remarkably good agreement with the experimentally found regime @xcite .",
    "the actual parameter regime where droplets are expected to form crystalline structures , on the basis of @xmath97 , is depicted in figure [ fig : figure4 ] , where the varied parameters are the ionic radii @xmath98 ( figure [ fig : figure4](a ) ) and the volume fraction and droplet radius @xmath99 ( figure [ fig : figure4](b ) ) .",
    "the lines show the envelopes of the regimes @xmath97 for all physically achievable ionic strengths @xmath22 .",
    "variations of the external potential @xmath100 by taking a non - zero @xmath20 are seen to result into a significantly modified crystallization regime .",
    "other solvation effects , e.g. hydration , hydrogen bonding , local alignment of dipolar fluid molecules , are therefore expected to be important for a proper quantitative picture .",
    "we examined this for @xmath101 ( figure [ fig : figure4 ] ) , which is considerable compared to @xmath102 for the present parameters but small compared to @xmath103 .",
    "figure [ fig : figure4](b ) shows that micron - sized droplets , for our standard parameter set , tend to crystallize at @xmath104 , which is somewhat higher than the experimentally observed regime @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "a similarly relatively high theoretical value for the crystallization volume fraction was found in @xcite , where curvature effects were studied , with @xmath106 . combining these results with those of figure [ fig : figure4](b )",
    "suggests that the experimental results may only be quantitatively explained by taking both curvature and specific solvation effects ( @xmath107 ) into account .",
    "this problem is left for future studies .",
    "by means of a non - linear poisson - boltzmann theory , that takes into account the born self - energies of the ions @xcite , and an specific solvation energy @xcite , ionic equilibrium distributions near an oil - water interface were calculated . a difference in self - energy",
    "was found to lead to a donnan potential and charge separation near the interface .",
    "the analytical expression for the charge of the medium per area of interface agrees roughly with numerical results of the poisson - boltzmann theory in spherical geometry @xcite , although the planar charge density is somewhat underestimated compared to the value for micron - sized water droplets in oils with @xmath108 .",
    "the charge is in good quantitative agreement with a linearized poisson - boltzmann theory that takes into account a finite interfacial width @xmath87 @xcite , showing independence of the charge on @xmath87 . for slightly polar oils ,",
    "i.e. @xmath63 , the typical charge of micron - sized water droplets ranges between @xmath109 elementary charges and the debye screening lengths range between @xmath110 , such that the particles repel each other electrostatically by many @xmath32 even if their centers are several radii apart .",
    "on the basis of an empirical crystallization condition @xcite we found a relatively narrow regime in the high dimensional parameter space , where water droplets in oil are expected to form crystalline structures , namely only when @xmath63 ( in striking agreement with experimental findings @xcite ) , @xmath111 , @xmath112 nm , and a sufficiently large difference between the ionic self - energies @xmath113 @xmath32 .",
    "the spontaneous charging of the water droplets might play an important role in the production and stabilization of emulsions with rather polar oils , since we have seen that by a judicious choice of the type of oil and salt ions , water droplets can be stabilized by these , sometimes surprisingly strong , electrostatic effects alone .",
