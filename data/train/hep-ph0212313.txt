    "one of the goals of modern physics is the exploration of internal structures of microscopic matter objects ; the main attention being devoted to nucleons at present .",
    "even if some characteristics of nucleon structure may be described on the basis of qcd there are still many open questions , as the most experimental data on diffractive scattering have been interpreted with the help of phenomenological models .",
    "the theory has concerned mainly the nucleon structure playing a role in deep inelastic nucleon scattering while a similar theory of diffractive collisions has not yet been practically available .    in the most phenomenological approaches to",
    "high - energy elastic hadron scattering one uses the elastic hadron scattering amplitude with a dominant imaginary part vanishing at the diffractive minimum @xcite ; its real part is introduced only to fill in the non - zero value of differential cross section @xmath0 in the diffraction dip .",
    "the corresponding elastic phase remains very small in a rather broad interval of momentum transfers @xmath1 .",
    "performing fourier - bessel transformation of such an amplitude one always obtains a central behavior of elastic hadron scattering in the impact parameter space , i.e. , with the majority of elastic hadronic collisions realized at impact parameter value @xmath2 ; colliding nucleons are interpreted as transparent objects @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of diffractive minimum does not mean at all that the imaginary part of the hadronic amplitude should vanish in it ; it means only that the sum of the squares of both its real and imaginary parts has a minimum .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that experimental data may be well described with the help of amplitude giving a peripheral behavior ( having maximum at a higher value of @xmath3 ) .",
    "in such a case the imaginary part of hadronic amplitude is dominant in a much smaller region of @xmath1 only . the peripheral interpretation of elastic hadron scattering at high - energy enables a unified description of all diffractive processes , i.e. , of both the elastic and diffractive production channels .",
    "the behavior of high - energy elastic hadron collisions in the impact parameter space can be simply characterized by the values of root - mean - squares of impact parameters corresponding to the elastic , inelastic and as well as total scattering which can be easily calculated directly from the @xmath1 dependent elastic hadron scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "these quantities characterize the ranges of forces responsible for all mentioned kinds of scattering .",
    "the values of elastic and inelastic root - mean - squares of impact parameters differ significantly in the case of the central and peripheral interpretations of elastic hadron scattering .    as the interference region of the coulomb and hadronic",
    "interaction is very narrow the elastic scattering data themselwes do not allow to decide between mentioned different alternatives . and",
    "it is necessary to look for other kinds of experiments .",
    "one possibility may consist in experiments with polarized nucleons .",
    "such experiments are planned to be performed at rhic and lhc @xcite .",
    "they include the measurement of spin correlation parameters in the diffractive region of @xmath4 elastic scattering .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate whether they might contribute to giving an answer to the given question .",
    "the individual spin components exhibit different @xmath1 dependence for peripheral or central behaviors which may manifest in different predictions concerning the analyzing power at higher @xmath5 values .",
    "the differential cross sections determined in an experiment are described by the absolute square of the total scattering amplitude including the electromagnetic and hadronic forces @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for the coulomb amplitude known from qed and @xmath8 is the elastic hadronic amplitude ; @xmath9 is the fine structure constant . for the relative phase @xmath10 between the coulomb and hadronic amplitudes",
    "various expressions are used . in the usual",
    "approaches the west and yennie simplified formula @xcite valid for very small values of @xmath5 is used .",
    "however , for the analysis at higher values of @xmath5 more precise formula seems to be preferable @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for the second born approximation of the pure coulomb amplitude and the term @xmath13 is defined by the coulomb - hadron interference .",
    "it has been found that the interference of the hadronic and electromagnetic amplitudes may give an important contribution not only at very small transfer momenta but also in the region of the diffraction minimum @xcite .",
    "for this purpose one should know the @xmath10 at sufficiently large momentum transfers , too .    as a standard amplitude",
    "let us take the amplitudes proposed in ref .",
    "it has been shown on the basis of sum rules @xcite that the main contribution to hadron interaction at large distances comes from the triangle diagram with @xmath14 meson exchange in the @xmath1 channel . as a result",
    ", the hadron amplitude can be represented as a sum of central and peripheral parts of the interaction @xmath15 where @xmath16 describes the interaction between the central parts of hadrons ; and @xmath17 is the sum of contributions of diagrams corresponding to the interactions of the central part of one hadron with the meson cloud of the other .",

    "really , parameters in the amplitude determined from one reaction , for example , elastic @xmath4 scattering , allow one to obtain a wide range of results for elastic meson - nucleon scattering and charge - exchange reaction @xmath30 at high energies .",
    "the preceeding approach of separating the coulomb and hadronic scattering is convenient in the case of usual weakly @xmath1 dependent phase giving the central description of elastic hadron collisions in the impact parameter space .",
    "however , when the @xmath1 dependent phase strongly increases with the increasing @xmath5 the more convenient method of separation of coulomb and hadronic scattering consists in the application of the approach proposed in refs . @xcite valid at any @xmath31 and @xmath1 ( up to the terms linear in @xmath32 ) .",
    "however , the dynamics of hadronic amplitude leading to peripherality has not been up to now theoretically specified . in principle it could be described in different ways , e.g. , in the simple regge pole model with the help of complex @xmath1 dependent residue functions , complex regge trajectories , etc .",
    "instead of it , in an analogy with the use of current analysis based on the west and yennie amplitude @xcite a convenient parameterization of both the modulus and the phase has been used ( for detail , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . such an approach enables to specify the elastic hadron scattering amplitude @xmath8 directly from the elastic scattering data .",
    "the difference between the phases leading either to central or peripheral distributions of elastic hadron scattering in the impact parameter space can be seen in fig . 1 ; the graphs correspond to @xmath33 scattering at energy of 541 gev @xcite ; similar @xmath1 dependencies may be also exhibited by the phases corresponding to the @xmath4 elastic scattering at energy of 53 gev ( see ref .",

    "@xcite that due to presence of the coulomb and hadronic interactions each total helicity amplitude @xmath38 can be written as the sum of the hadronic @xmath39 and electromagnetic @xmath40 helicity amplitudes bound with the same relative phase @xmath41 valid for small @xmath5 values @xmath42 where the electromagnetic helicity amplitudes can be explicitly determined within the framework of qed .",
    "their limiting values at high energies have been given in ref .",
    "@xcite ; only three of them are independent at asymptotic energies .    at present , the spin effects owing to the coulomb - nucleon interference ( cni ) at very small transfer momenta have been widely discussed in the relation to future spin experiments at rhic and lhc .",
    "these effects had not been well understood in the domain of the diffraction minimum .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coulomb - hadron interference phase at higher @xmath5 has not been known sufficiently . in @xcite , the phase @xmath43 of the pure coulomb amplitude in the second born approximation with the form factor in the monopole and",
    "dipole forms has been calculated in a broad region of @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown that the behavior of @xmath43 at higher values of @xmath1 sharply differs from the behavior of @xmath43 obtained in @xcite .",
    "for the total phase factor that can be used in the whole diffraction region of elastic hadron scattering it has been found @xcite @xmath44 with @xmath45     + \\frac{{\\lambda}\\rho}{12 } k_1(\\rho { \\lambda } ) [ 11 + \\frac{5}{4 } { \\lambda}^2 \\rho^2].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath46 and @xmath47 are modified bessel functions of the zero and first orders , @xmath48gev@xmath49 , @xmath50 is euler constant and @xmath51 .",

    ", we obtain in the first case a positive non - small contribution which changes ( reduces ) the size of the spin correlation parameter owing to the hadron - spin - flip amplitude .",
    "especially it is to be noted that there is a heavy shift of the point where @xmath34 changes its sign .",
    "the calculations show that such additional contributions lead to the change of the position of the negative maximum of @xmath34 to larger @xmath5 . in the other case , with the zero of the real part of the scattering amplitude ,",
    "we obtain only negative contribution which enhanced the magnitude of @xmath34 owing to the hadron - spin - flip amplitude and change the position of maximum to the low @xmath5 .",
    "such a picture corresponds to the highest energy at rhic .",
    "of course , @xmath52 has small magnitude but can be measured in an accurate experiment .",
    "we have shown that the two different @xmath1 dependent phases of elastic hadron scattering amplitude giving the central and peripheral distributions of elastic hadron scattering in the impact parameter space can give also different predictions of the spin correlation parameter - the analyzing power @xmath34 at higher values of @xmath5 ; mainly in the region of diffractive minimum .",
    "this is due to the the interference of the spin - non - flip elastic scattering amplitude and the electromagnetic spin - flip amplitude .",
    "the measurement of the correction @xmath54 in the domain of the diffraction minimum can give valuable information about the structure of the elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "in spite of the large contribution of the hadron - spin - flip amplitude , we can see that taking into account the odderon contributions leads to visible changes in spin correlation effects .",
    "so , the precise measurement of @xmath34 in the region of the diffraction minimum and the treatment of their energy dependence can give some additional information which would allow to define the sign and magnitude of the odderon contribution , too .",
    "one should mention the importance of the @xmath1 dependence of the odderon amplitude , and therefore , the possible bounds on the @xmath1 dependence of the odderon amplitude might be also revealed in the given experiments ."
