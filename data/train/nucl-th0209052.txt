    "the quality of the fits are good and the predictions of data not in the data set is used to verify the procedure . however , unlike the usual ria , where we have generally used scalar , vector and tensor densities from the results of relativistic effective field theory ( eft ) calculations , we use the ria as a basis for extracting the vector neutron density as well as the two scalar densities using a global fitting procedure .",
    "next we describe the treatment of the vector and scalar densities .",

    "three different eft densities are used , two are point coupling models , va3 and fz4 , and one is a meson model , ma4 .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 is not sensitive to the eft model chosen and the final difference and the scalar proton and neutron densities are not sensitive to the eft model chosen even though the values of @xmath8 for n @xmath58 z in these models differ widely .",

    "this is one of the reasons for using a global approach when the data set used is large and usually correlated . in this work we use elastic p + a data between 500 mev and 1040 mev for @xmath0ca , @xmath1ca and @xmath2pb . for @xmath0ca",

    "the quality of the global fits to the data are good and the predictions for data not in the global data sets verify the procedure .    in previous dirac phenomenological ( dp )",
    "global fitting , the data sets were cut at 100 degrees in the center of mass or at momentum transfer q at 3.0 @xmath35 , whichever came first . in this work",
    "we do global fits using a variety of momentum transfer values as discussed below .",
    "in addition , as is discussed later , we also test the sensitivity of the input to the model .    in the global fitting",
    "we have used five momentum transfer ranges from 0.0 @xmath35 to 1.5 @xmath35 to 0.0 @xmath35 to 3.5 @xmath35 in steps of 0.5 @xmath35 . or four momentum transfer ranges from 0.0 @xmath35 to 2.0 @xmath35 to 0.0 @xmath35 to 3.5 @xmath35 again in steps of 0.5 @xmath35 .",
    "the values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 are expected to change with the value of the momentum transfer range used as the data sets are changed .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 for a given momentum transfer range ( we use five momentum transfer ranges or four momentum transfer ranges ) are clustered in a reasonably well constrained set of values for @xmath8 and @xmath7 , we call these stable results . the momentum transfer range for 0.0 @xmath35 to 1.5",
    "@xmath35 is almost always the outlier , which is understandable as the data set is small and does not have the diffraction structure needed when fitting proton scattering from nuclear targets .",
    "of course in any such global approach the data sets are usually correlated .",
    "this is certainly true as the data sets sets with different momentum transfer ranges do overlap .",
    "thus a statistical analysis to obtain a mean value and a standard deviation can not generally be used .",
    "however , we can determine the range of the values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 for each fit from every momentum transfer range , and obtain the values for @xmath8 and @xmath7 which could be shown as a scatter plot , as is usually done when data sets used are correlated .",
    "we have obtained the range of values for @xmath8 and @xmath7 for every test considered , while these ranges can not be interpreted as resulting from a statistical analysis we found that doing such an analysis gives a useful guide to present the results .",
    "there are a number of features in the fitting procedures which could produce changes in the neutron density , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "as mentioned above , two ranges of momentum transfer cuts are used . in the following sensitivity tests we use both ranges .",
    "generally the smaller range produces the smallest range of values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 so in most of the figures we show the larger range values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 which gives the most conservative results .",
    "we test the results obtained when the following features of the model used in the fitting procedures are changed .",
    "first the three different eft models used in fixing the 10th parameter are considered @xcite . to investigate the effect of the @xmath29 used in obtaining the point proton density we use two different forms they are identified as @xmath60 from @xcite and @xmath61 from @xcite .",
    "the set chosen for the arndt nn amplitudes is input to the fitting procedure , and we use sets fa00 and sm86 to find the sensitivity of the fits to this input @xcite . the data sets included in the fits have been changed to see if the results change significantly .",
    "finally , we use the three different charge density models used in the analysis of electron - nucleus elastic scattering data ; the three parameter fermi ( 3pf ) , the sum of gaussian ( sog ) and the fourier - bessel ( fb ) @xcite .",
    "thus each target we have done global fits which have used effective field theory densities ma4 , fz4 and va3 , and for each three charge distributions are used .",
    "in addition two different form factors @xmath60 and @xmath61 and two sets of arndt amplitudes , set fa00 and set sm86 . figures  1 - 5 show the results of these tests of the global fitting procedure .    the results for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given in three tables , found in the appendix ; table i for @xmath0ca , table  ii for @xmath1ca and table  iii for @xmath2pb .",
    "there are three general cases we use in testing the global fits : case 1 uses arndt amplitudes set fa00 and the @xmath60 form factor ; case 2 uses arndt amplitudes set fa00 and the @xmath61 form factor ; and case 3 uses arndt amplitudes set sm86 and the @xmath60 form factor . in every case , we obtain good global fits for ma4 , fz4 and va3 for every charge distribution used ; sog , 3pf , and fb . as discussed above the momentum cuts ranges used",

    "the one with five momentum transfer ranges or four momentum transfer ranges we calculate the mean and standard deviation for @xmath7 and @xmath8 for every global fit , this gives us an average over all eft models for a given charge distribution .",
    "this is denoted by @xmath62 in the tables .",
    "this is not to be taken as a statistical error , it is however a convenient way to show the range of the values in a consistent way .",
    "we do this rather than remove every outlier . then for each case we show the combined values of the range for @xmath7 and @xmath8 for that case , this gives the average over all charge distributions as well as over all eft models .",
    "these results are denoted as @xmath63 and @xmath62 in the tables .",
    "finally , we calculate the ranges of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for all three cases combined for each target .",
    "the last calculation , which combines all of the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for every test made , gives us the most conservative results . from these final test cases , shown at the bottom of the tables in the appendix",

    "i.e. _ the values did not vary very much , see tables  i , ii and iii in the appendix .",
    "this is especially true for using the sog charge distribution . in this case",
    "the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 using the five momentum transfer ranges are : for @xmath0ca , @xmath76 fm and @xmath77 fm ; for @xmath1ca , @xmath78 fm and @xmath79 fm ; and for @xmath2pb , @xmath80 fm and @xmath81 fm .",

    "both five momentum transfer ranges and four momentum transfer ranges were used .",

    "this is not to be taken as a statistical analysis , but as a way to show the range of the values in a consistent way , they are shown as bars in the figures .",
    "we do this rather than remove outliers .",
    "then for each case we show the combined values of the range for @xmath7 and @xmath8 for that case , this gives the average over all charge distributions as well as over all eft models .",
    "these results are denoted as @xmath63 and @xmath62 in the tables .",
    "we then calculate the ranges of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for all three cases combined for each target . from these final test cases , shown at the bottom of the tables in the appendix , using the five momentum transfer ranges we obtain the following values : for @xmath0ca , @xmath64 fm and @xmath65 fm ; for @xmath1ca , @xmath66 fm and @xmath67 fm ; for @xmath2pb , @xmath68 and @xmath69 fm . in conclusion , the rms neutron radius , @xmath7 and the neutron skin thickness @xmath8 obtained from the global fits that we consider to be the most reliable ranges of our results are given as follows : for @xmath0ca , @xmath9 fm and @xmath10 fm ; for @xmath1ca , @xmath11 fm and @xmath12 fm ; and for @xmath2pb @xmath13 fm and @xmath14 fm .",
    "the authors have found that the global fits are more stable when using the arndt nn amplitude set fa00 rather than the arndt nn amplitude set sm86 .",
    "this might be expected as the fa00 analysis is more recent .",
    "both of the form factors used , @xmath60 and @xmath61 when using fa00 were the most stable , see tables  i , ii and iii in the appendix .",
    "the impact on the fits due to the charge distribution input , sog , 3pf and fb , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffcd1 ] , clearly showed that the cases using the sog and 3pf charge distributions were stable , _",
    "i.e. _ the ranges overlapped , for all targets , however , for @xmath0ca the results for the fb charge distribution gave very different results , see table  i. we also found that the fits using arndt nn amplitude set fa00 , the @xmath60 form factor , and the sog charge distribution produced the most stable results .",
    "in this case the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 using the five momentum transfer ranges are : for @xmath0ca , @xmath76 fm and @xmath77 fm ; for @xmath1ca , @xmath78 fm and @xmath79 fm ; and for @xmath2pb @xmath80 fm and @xmath81 fm .",
    "these values , as well as the values using the most conservative errors and the results that we consider most reliable , are in agreement with nonrelativistic skyrme models @xcite , relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model extended to include density dependent meson - nucleon couplings @xcite and results from a recent analysis of antiprotonic atoms @xcite .",
    "our results for @xmath1ca and @xmath2pb are generally not in agreement with relativistic mean - field models , see ref .  6 and references there in .",
    "the global fit based on the ria is a new tool for obtaining the neutron density .",
    "the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 obtained are robust .",
    "this quality is verified in several ways as discussed in section iii .",
    "for example , we checked the sensitivity due to the data sets included in the fit by doing global fits using only two data sets ( 497.5 mev and 797.5 mev ) for @xmath0ca and @xmath2pb as well as four data sets .",
    "the values of @xmath8 for the two data set case are : for @xmath0ca @xmath82 fm ; and for @xmath2pb @xmath83 fm .",
    "these results agree well with @xmath8 for the four data set case : for @xmath0ca @xmath77 fm ; and for @xmath2pb @xmath81 fm .",
    "these results , shown in fig .  [ fig : difftwosets ] , motivates us to use the global procedure for all nuclei that have at least two data sets in the medium energy range .",
    "this work provides energy independent values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in contrast to the energy dependent values obtained by previous studies .",
    "in addition , the results presented in paper show that the expected rms neutron radius and skin thickness for @xmath0ca is accurately reproduced .",
    "the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 obtained from the global fits that we consider to be the most reliable are given as follows : we plan to extend our work to additional nuclei and will continue to investigate different models and procedures . the goal is to continue to improve quality of neutron densities that result from our global fits .",
