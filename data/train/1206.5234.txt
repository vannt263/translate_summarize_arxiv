    "in this paper , we classify the right - angled coxeter groups with no @xmath2 subgroups that have locally connected cat(0 ) boundary .",
    "we say a cat(0 ) group has locally ( respectively , non - locally ) connected boundary if all cat(0 ) boundaries of the group are locally ( respectively non - locally ) connected .",
    "our main theorem states that if the coxeter presentation of the group satisfies an elementary combinatorial condition then this group has locally connected boundary and otherwise has non - locally connected boundary .",
    "this condition was first considered in @xcite , where in fact , the authors conjectured that any right - angled coxeter group has locally connected boundary iff the group presentation satisfies this condition .",
    "the primary working tool for both this paper and @xcite is the notion of a _ filter _ for cat(0 ) geodesics @xmath3 and @xmath4 in a cat(0 ) space @xmath5 on which the coxeter group @xmath1 acts geometrically .",
    "a filter is a connected , one - ended planar graph whose edges are labeled by the coxeter generators @xmath6 of @xmath1 .",
    "hence there is a natural ( proper ) map of the filter into the cayley graph of @xmath0 , which in turn maps properly and @xmath1-equivariantly into the cat(0 ) space @xmath5 .",
    "the two sides of the filter track the geodesics @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the limit set of the filter is a connected set in @xmath7 ( the boundary of @xmath5 ) , containing the limit points of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the idea is to construct a filter in such a way so that if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are  close \" in @xmath7 , then the filter has  small \" limit set containing the limit points @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and local connectivity of the boundary of @xmath5 follows .    in @xcite , two combinatorial conditions are defined on the coxeter presentation of the group .",
    "the main theorem there states : if the first condition holds then the coxeter group has non - locally connected boundary , and if neither condition holds then the coxeter group has locally connected boundary .",
    "in fact , when neither condition holds , the filters constructed in @xcite basically have hyperbolic geometry ; i.e. any geodesic path in the cayley graph from the base point of the filter to another point of the filter must track the filter geodesic connecting these two points ( just as in a word hyperbolic group ) . in this paper ,",
    "the geometry of our filters is necessarily more complex .",
    "the no @xmath2 subgroup hypothesis does restrict the pathology of the geometry of the filter , but our results are the natural next step towards a full classification of right - angled coxeter groups with locally connected boundary , and give hard evidence that the conjectured classification of @xcite is sound .",
    "if a coxeter group has no @xmath8 subgroup then it is word hyperbolic @xcite , and all one - ended word hyperbolic groups have ( unique ) locally connected boundary @xcite .",
    "januszkiewicz and swiatkowski ( @xcite ) produce word hyperbolic , right - angled coxeter groups of virtual cohomological dimension @xmath9 for all positive integers @xmath9 , so our no @xmath2 hypothesis does not restrict the virtual cohomological dimension of the groups under consideration . in @xcite , croke and kleiner exhibit a one - ended cat(0 ) group with non - homeomorphic boundaries .",
    "each of these boundaries is in fact connected but not path connected ( see @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "( by classical point set topology ) these boundaries are not locally connected .",
    "it seems that many of the serious pathologies one sees in boundaries of cat(0 ) groups , but not in boundaries of word hyperbolic groups , happen in the presence of non - local connectivity . at the time of this writing , no cat(0 )",
    "group has been shown to have non - homeomorphic boundaries , one of which is locally connected .",
    "there are numerous questions about how or even if the homology and homotopy of two boundaries of a cat(0 ) group can differ .",
    "these questions may be more tractable if the boundaries considered are locally connected .",
    "if our results extend to all right - angled coxeter groups then those with locally connected boundary should provide an interesting testing ground for such questions .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "basic definitions and background results are listed , including a lemma ( [ diamond ] ) that provides the fundamental combinatorial tool for measuring how large the limit set of a filter might be . in section 3 ,",
    "the basics of cat(0 ) spaces and groups are outlined , and we list two tracking results ( developed in @xcite ) that connect the cat(0 ) geometry and algebraic combinatorics of right - angled coxeter groups . in section 4 ,",
    "we develop the idea of a filter , define a virtual factor separator and prove our main theorem :    [ mth ] suppose @xmath0 is a one - ended right - angled coxeter system that has no visual subgroup isomorphic to @xmath10 .    1 .",
    "if @xmath1 visually splits as @xmath11 then @xmath12 is word hyperbolic , @xmath1 has unique boundary homeomorphic to the suspension of the boundary of @xmath12 , and the boundary of @xmath1 is non - locally connected iff @xmath12 is infinite ended .",
    "2 .   otherwise , @xmath1 has locally connected boundary iff @xmath0 has no virtual factor separator .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a one - ended right - angled coxeter system that has no visual subgroup isomorphic to @xmath10 .",
    "then all cat(0 ) boundaries of @xmath1 are locally connected or all are non - locally connected .",
    "the group @xmath1 visually splits as in item ( 1 ) of the theorem precisely when there are @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 commutes with @xmath16 , so this condition is easily checked . if a cat(0 ) group splits as @xmath17 then any boundary of @xmath18 is the suspension of a boundary of @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) and this suspension is locally connected iff the boundary of @xmath12",
    "is locally connected .",
    "if @xmath0 is a one - ended right - angled coxeter system with no visual subgroup isomorphic to @xmath10 and @xmath1 visually splits as @xmath19 , then @xmath12 is word hyperbolic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check if a coxeter group is infinite - ended ( see remark [ infend ] ) .",
    "thus item ( 1 ) of the theorem is easily verified and the real content of the theorem is contained in item ( 2 ) .",
    "if @xmath20 is a virtual factor separator for @xmath0 , then @xmath1 visually splits as an amalgamated product @xmath21 ( here @xmath12 and @xmath22 are subsets of @xmath6 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 )",
    ". therefore local connectivity of boundaries of @xmath1 is directly tied to visual splittings .    in section 5",
    ", we give examples to show there are no combination or splitting results for right - angled coxeter groups that respect local connectivity of boundaries .",
    "one example describes a right - angled coxeter group as the ( visual ) amalgamated product @xmath25 where @xmath12 and @xmath22 are one - ended and word hyperbolic ( so both have locally connected boundary ) and @xmath26 is virtually a surface group ( with boundary a circle ) , but @xmath1 has non - locally connected boundary .",
    "the second example describes a right - angled coxeter group @xmath1 that visually splits as @xmath27 , and a single element of infinite order in @xmath26 determines a boundary point of non - local connectivity in both @xmath12 and @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless , our main theorem implies @xmath1 has locally connected boundary .",
    "these examples indicate there are no reasonable graph of groups approaches to this problem .",
    "morse theory also seems unhelpful , but we do not expand here .",
    "we use @xcite and @xcite as basic references for the results in this section .",
