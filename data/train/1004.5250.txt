    "in pseudoscalar meson photoproduction , the reaction is completely described by four amplitudes that are functions of hadronic mass @xmath0 and center of mass scattering angle @xmath1 ( or , equivalently @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) . if one were able to extract these amplitudes ( allowing of course for an overall phase ) at @xmath4 or @xmath5 points , there is nothing else one could measure that would alter how one could interpret the physics of the reaction .",
    "this observation is especially important in the study of the spectrum of baryon resonances . despite several decades of investigation , it is still not clear whether certain states that are predicted by quark models exist or not .",
    "the signatures of any hitherto undiscovered states must be very subtle , to the extent that they are not readily apparent from cross section measurements alone . if one could unpick the reaction amplitudes from suitable observables , that would constitute the most comprehensive test for models . in the case of establishing @xmath2-channel resonances , extraction of the four amplitudes may not even be enough .",
    "partial - wave analyses will be required , and these can lead to finite ambiguities that require additional information to resolve . in any event , a potential new physical effect would have to manifest itself clearly , or be declared unproven .    in order to extract the amplitudes ,",
    "it is necessary to measure several polarization observables .",
    "in addition to the cross section , there are three single - spin observables :- particle and @xmath6-beam asymmetry , as well as @xmath7-photon polarization and @xmath7-recoil . ]",
    "@xmath8 ( photon beam asymmetry ) , @xmath9 ( recoil polarization ) and @xmath10 ( target polarization ) , which can be labelled as @xmath11-type measurements .",
    "there are also four beam - recoil ( @xmath12-type ) , four beam - target ( @xmath13-type ) and four recoil - target ( @xmath14-type ) observables .",
    "all these observables are bilinear combinations of the four reaction amplitudes , and are not independent . in principle",
    ", therefore , it is not necessary to measure all of them to be able to infer the amplitudes .",
    "as we have now entered an era in which single- and double - polarization measurements can be made , there exists a real opportunity for progress in understanding pseudoscalar meson photoproduction reactions , and for potential discovery of new states .",
    "the problem of finding a minimum set of measurements that allows the unambiguous extraction of amplitudes was addressed by barker , donnachie and storrow @xcite ) .",
    "they found that , in addition to the single polarization set , five more double polarization observables were needed to remove all ambiguities in the quadrants for each relative phase angle .",
    "more recently , chiang and tabakin @xcite carried out a detailed analysis of the algebra of observables using fierz identities , and showed that the selection of just four suitably chosen double polarization observables was sufficient to remove the ambiguities .",
    "such sets have been designated as `` complete '' sets .",
    "the fierz identity analysis led to a large number of identities among observables .",
    "work by artru et al .",
    "@xcite extended this by using positivity constraints to derive many _ inequalities_. this means that the measurement of a subset of observables places limits on the possible values of the undetermined observables , so the inequalities provide useful guides to whether the values of experimental data are physical .",
    "labelling sets of observables as `` complete '' , implies somehow that one has reached an ultimate state of knowledge .",
    "however , the reality is that all experimental measurements of observables carry with them a finite uncertainty , so the concept of completeness is not well defined .",
    "one might be tempted to regard this as an experimental failing , but in practice any experiment has to be performed within constraints of time and technological feasibility ; the experiment with zero uncertainty can only be accomplished in an infinite time . the alternative is to embrace experimental uncertainty and include it in the interpretation of results .",
    "the problem of uncertainty due to noise in communication channels led shannon to develop the foundations of information theory @xcite . in that seminal work ,",
    "the concept of entropy was used as a means of quantifying an amount of information .",
    "one can also apply this to measurements . to introduce the idea with a concrete example ,",
    "suppose one measured a quantity @xmath15 and obtained a measured value @xmath16 with an uncertainty @xmath17 .",
    "the reporting of this measurement would usually be in the form @xmath18 , but this is really shorthand for a gaussian probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath19 .",
    "the entropy is then@xmath20 which for a gaussian pdf is @xmath21 .",
    "if a more accurate measurement were to be made , resulting in a reduced uncertainty @xmath22 , the gain in information can be quantified as@xmath23    by extending this idea to the uncertainty in the reaction amplitudes , it is possible to quantify how much information is gained following the measurement of one or more observables .",
    "this article represents a preliminary study of information entropy as applied to pseudoscalar meson photoproduction .",
    "section [ sec : measuring - information ] develops the idea encapsulated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy ] ) for the reaction amplitudes , and introduces a means of calculating it . in section [ sec : results ] examples of hypothetical measurements are given , which show how the magnitudes and relative phases of the amplitudes can be determined .",
    "in addition to this , section [ sec : comparison - of - models ] briefly considers how the information content of measured data can be used as a guide to estimating whether the measurement could in principle reduce uncertainty in derived physical quantities .",
    "a full analysis of reactions will involve measurements over all scattering angles and cover the mass range of interest . to develop the concept of information content ,",
    "however , we restrict ourselves to considering one region ( or `` bin '' ) in @xmath24 space . the ideas can be straightforwardly extended to include many regions , since entropies are additive .",
    "the issue of whether different experiments ( measuring different observables ) have covered the same @xmath24 space has been avoided .",
    "the choice of basis for amplitudes is arbitrary ; information content is derived from the measured observables , so it can not depend on the choice . in this work ,",
    "the transversity basis is used , where the spin of the target nucleon and recoiling baryon is projected onto the normal to the scattering plane , and the linear polarization of the photon is either normal or parallel to the scattering plane .",
    "it is assumed that differential cross section measurements have been performed to a level of accuracy of , say , a few percent , so that further measurement would be unlikely significantly to improve knowledge of the amplitudes .",
    "the information gain to be studied here is solely due to an increased accuracy in the knowledge of the polarization observables . since all these observables are asymmetries , no generality is lost if we rescale the amplitudes @xmath25 such that@xmath26 so that the cross section provides an overall scale factor . applying this rescaling , we have@xmath27 since these reduced amplitudes @xmath28 are complex",
    ", this represents the equation of a unit 7-sphere , i.e. the eight numbers that are the real and imaginary parts are constrained to be on the surface of a unit hypersphere in 8 dimensions ( a unit 8-ball ) .",
    "the definitions of the observables in terms of the reduced amplitudes are given in appendix [ sec : definitions - of - observables ] .",
    "one side - effect of choosing transversity amplitudes is that measurement of the @xmath11-type observables leads to the extraction of the magnitudes , leaving just the relative phases to be determined .",
    "there is often a tacit assumption that it is easier to perform single - spin asymmetry measurements .",
    "for that reason many analyses @xcite start from a point where values of the @xmath11-type observables have been determined .",
    "the entropy associated with the state of knowledge of the amplitudes is an multidimensional extension of eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy]):@xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the values of the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes . before the measurement of any polarization observable , there is no knowledge of @xmath30 , other than the constraint imposed by eq .",
    "( [ eq:7-sphere ] ) . to encode this as a pdf",
    ", we can spread the probability uniformly over the surface area of the unit 7-sphere to give@xmath31 which results in a pleasingly simple entropy of @xmath32    the act of measurement can be viewed as a compression of this `` uniform '' pdf into as small a region of @xmath30 space as possible . as a rough example , consider a set of measurements that results in a multi - dimensional gaussian pdf in amplitude space .",
    "the entropy of an @xmath33-dimensional gaussian is @xcite@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the determinant of the covariance matrix .",
    "while the four complex amplitudes have eight numbers in total , representing real and imaginary parts , all observable quantities are invariant to the choice on an overall phase angle , so the effective number of numbers to extract is seven . in this case , a 7-dimensional gaussian is used to estimate information gain .",
    "the projection of the gaussian onto the 7-sphere will induce off - diagonal correlations in @xmath36 , but for simplicity we ignore any correlations and take the standard deviation in each of the @xmath30 to be the same ( @xmath37 , say ) .",
    "the resulting approximate expression is@xmath38 the gain in information is the difference between this and the initial uniform pdf over the 7-sphere:@xmath39 a plot of this quantity as function the size of standard deviation is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : rough - guide - to ] ) .",
    "the choice of logarithm base is arbitrary , but for this work we select it to be 2 .",
    "this means that the unit of information is the `` bit '' ( i.e. knowing whether a quantity is 1 or 0 ) .",
    "this unit system is convenient for considering quantities related to polarization ; determining whether an asymmetry is positive or negative is equivalent to a gain of one bit of information , whereas determining a phase angle quadrant is a gain of two bits .",
    "( color online ) rough guide to information gain as a function of the standard deviation @xmath37 in the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    from fig .",
    "( [ fig : rough - guide - to ] ) it can be seen that if one wants to have a measured accuracy of the amplitudes to a value @xmath40 , the gain in information is roughly 21 bits ( see dashed vertical line on graph ) . attempting to achieve much better accuracy than this from experiments",
    "is not likely to be practical , so we should therefore regard the 21-bit information gain as a target figure to aim for , if we want to be able to say that we have extracted amplitudes . furthermore ,",
    "if two models differ by only a few percent in the values of their amplitudes , it is not reasonable to expect that comparison with data would ever lead to being able to differentiate them .      while the calculation sketched out above",
    "is a useful rough guide , when an actual set of observables have been measured , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nd - entropy ] ) will need to be evaluated numerically .",
    "the number of dimensions in this system indicates the use of monte carlo techniques , and a simple implementation of this is as follows .",
    "sample points are generated randomly in amplitude space with uniform density on the surface of the unit 7-sphere .",
    "the number of points @xmath41 needs to be sufficiently large to minimize monte carlo sampling uncertainty .",
    "for each point , the observables are evaluated according to the algebra of table [ tab : definition - of - observable ] in the appendix .",
    "the use of random values of amplitudes was described in @xcite in order to establish , for combinations of observables , the limits of regions in observable space that are allowed by postivity constraints , and using this a a guide for deriving inequalities .",
    "the present work goes further by not only taking into account these positivity constraints , but also estimating the pdfs of the combinations of observables .",
    "one can then simulate the process of measuring an observable by weighting all the points by another pdf representing the measured observable .    in practice ,",
    "the pdf of an asymmetry is likely to be something like a beta distribution ( or a gaussian approximation thereof ) . for illustrative purposes , however , we can use a simple top - hat function , which for a single observable is equivalent to reducing the range of values from @xmath42 $ ] to @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath44 is the measured result with some uncertainty @xmath45 . if the uniform probability density on a multi - dimensional surface @xmath46 is @xmath47 .",
    "the entropy of a uniform distribution in a volume @xmath46 is then@xmath48 as illustrated by the value for the 7-sphere in eq .",
    "( [ eq:7-sphere-1 ] ) .",
    "if the surface is reduced by a cut , say from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , the probability density will be uniform in @xmath50 and zero otherwise , so the gain in information is simply the log of the ratio of the two surface areas:@xmath51    when cuts representing the measurement of a combination of observables are imposed , the number of remaining points @xmath52 is an estimate of the remaining volume , so@xmath53",
    "so in order to gain the 21 bits of information , the surface area in amplitude space ( and hence the number of points ) needs to be reduced by a factor of @xmath54 .",
    "this is best illustrated with a simple example , such as the measurement of one polarization observable , recoil polarization , say .",
    "figure [ fig : distribution - of - values ] shows in the light shade the distribution of @xmath55 points when sampling is done uniformly in amplitude space .",
    "the dark shaded region shows 126045 points selected when a simulated measurement of @xmath56 is selected .",
    "the result is an information gain of @xmath57 bits , where the uncertainty is an estimate of the monte carlo error .",
    "so we can expect that a measurement of one polarization observable to an accuracy of @xmath5810% will give us about 3 bits of information .",
    "( color online ) distribution of values of recoil polarization from the uniform pdf in amplitude space .",
    "shaded region represent the possible values remaining after a `` measurement '' . ]    note that the `` uncut '' or prior distribution is quadratic in shape , not only for recoil polarization , but for all observables .",
    "this is a consequence of the observables being bilinear combinations of the amplitudes .",
    "for the extraction of amplitudes , it is usually assumed that the @xmath11-type observables ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) have to be measured .",
    "let us examine how much information one gains by making such measurements .    as shown in @xcite",
    ", the constraints among observables @xmath59 carve out a tetrahedron inside a cube @xmath60^{3}$ ] in @xmath61-space . to approximate a measurement of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", we define a spherical region , of radius @xmath44 , i.e.@xmath62 where @xmath63 are the coordinates of the sphere centre .",
    "this spherical cut can be moved to various points within the tetrahedron , and the effect on the distributions of magnitudes and phases studied .",
    "a typical example is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bottom - left - panel ] .",
    "the bottom left panel shows a projection of the @xmath61 distributions , which highlights the tetrahedral region .",
    "recall that the points in the light shaded region have been initially sampled over amplitude space , so this represents a projection into @xmath61-space , and affirms the constraints defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : brt - constraints ] ) .",
    "the points in the dark sphere are those selected by the choice of cut region .",
    "the radius of the spherical cut is 0.1 , which is equivalent in information gain to a measured accuracy in each observable of better that @xmath64 ( see later ) .",
    "it is unlikely , when statistical and systematic uncertainties are taken into account , that experiments will be able to determine observables to much greater accuracy than this .    in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : bottom - left - panel ] , the spherical cut is just touching the midpoint of one of the tetrahedron faces .",
    "the top row shows the magnitudes of the amplitudes , and it is clear that values for each one can now be estimated .",
    "note , however , that there is much greater uncertainty in @xmath65 than in the other ones .",
    "the relative phase angles are displayed in the remaining panels . while only three relative angles are independent , all six possibilities are shown .",
    "this is because , for situations in which the magnitudes of two amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath66 are almost equal ( as in this case ) , very small uncertainties in the relative phase of the two amplitudes with respect to a third ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) could lead to very large uncertainties in their relative phase @xmath69 .",
    "it is to be expected that there should be no relative phase information for transversity amplitudes if only @xmath11-type measurements are made , and this is apparent from the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : bottom - left - panel ] .",
    "the observed increase towards @xmath70 is due to the fact that the relative angles are formed from the difference of two uniform random variables .",
