    "the two - nucleon spectral function , yielding the probability to remove two nucleons with momenta @xmath1 and @xmath2 from nuclear matter leaving the residual system with excitation energy @xmath3 , is defined as ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the @xmath6-particle nuclear matter ground state with energy @xmath7 , @xmath8 denotes a @xmath9-nucleon intermediate state with energy @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the usual creation operator .",
    "the two - nucleon spectral function carries relevant information on the short range structure of the nuclear medium and nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) correlations .",
    "therefore , a considerable effort aimed at extracting experimental information on @xmath12 is currently being undertaken . in this context , a very important role",
    "is played by electron - nucleus scattering experiments ( a number of theoretical and experimental topics in the field of electron - nucleus scattering are reviewed in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "unambiguous evidence of strong correlation effects has been provided by single nucleon knock out @xmath13 reactions , showing that in a nucleus only about 70  % of the nucleons are in states of low momentum and low removal energy , that can be described by a mean field theory .",
    "the remaining 30 % of the nucleons belong to strongly correlated pairs , whose occurrence is mainly to be ascribed to the one - pion - exchange tensor force and to the repulsive core of the nn interaction .",
    "the available @xmath13 data at low missing momentum and low missing energy clearly show the depletion of the occupation probabilities of single particle states predicted by the nuclear shell model ( for a recent review see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , thus providing a somewhat indirect measurement of correlation effects .",
    "complementary information will soon be available from single nucleon knock out experiments specifically designed to investigate the kinematical region corresponding to large missing momentum and large missing energy , where correlation effects are believed to be dominant@xcite .    over the past decade",
    ", the availability of a new generation of high energy 100 % duty - cycle electron beams has made it possible to carry out double coincidence @xmath14 experiments , in which two knocked out nucleons are detected . in principle , these experiments may allow for direct measurements of _ correlation observables _ , such as the momentum space two - nucleon distribution or the two - nucleon spectral function .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , extracting the relevant dynamical information from the measured @xmath14 cross section may turn out to be a challenging task , requiring both a careful choice of the kinematical setup and a quantitative theoretical understanding of the final state interactions ( fsi ) of the knocked out nucleons .    regardless of the difficulties involved in the interpretation of the experimental data , reliable theoretical calculations of the two - nucleon emission cross section carried out within the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) , in which all",
    "the nuclear structure information is contained in the two - nucleon spectral function , have to be regarded as a minimal starting point , which can provide guidance for the optimization of future experiments .",
    "the basic assumptions underlying the pwia scheme are that i ) the exchanged virtual photon couples to either of the two outgoing nucleons and ii ) fsi effects are negligible .",
    "the pwia cross section of the process in which an electron of initial energy @xmath15 is scattered into the solid angle @xmath16 with energy @xmath17 , while two nucleons of kinetic energies @xmath18 and @xmath19 are ejected into the solid angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , takes the simple factorized form @xmath22 where @xmath23 describes the structure of the electromagnetic vertex , @xmath24 is the nucleon mass and @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the momenta of the detected nucleons .",
    "the missing momentum @xmath27 and missing energy @xmath28 are defined as @xmath29 @xmath30 being the momentum transfer , and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the kinetic energy of the recoiling @xmath9-particle system .",
    "the function @xmath33 appearing in eq.([pwia : xsec ] ) can be written in terms of the two - nucleon spectral functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "pioneering studies of the pwia two - nucleon emission cross section of the @xmath36 reaction are discussed in ref.@xcite , whereas a g - matrix perturbation theory calculation of the @xmath37 two - proton spectral function is described in ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a calculation of the nuclear matter @xmath12 performed using correlated basis function ( cbf ) perturbation theory .",
    "our theoretical approach , in which the effects of the nonperturbative components of the nn interaction are incorporated in the basis function using a variational approach , has proved to be particularly suited to describe quantities which are strongly affected by nn correlations , such as the single nucleon spectral function @xmath38@xcite , the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath39@xcite and the off - diagonal density matrix @xmath40@xcite .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we evaluate the dominant contributions to @xmath12 at the zero - th order of cbf , as well as the perturbative corrections that have been shown to be relevant in the calculation of @xmath38 .",
    "cbf theory of infinite nuclear matter is built on the set of _ correlated _ states : @xmath41 |n\\rangle_{fg}\\ ,   \\label{basis}\\ ] ] obtained by applying a symmetrized product of two - body correlation operators , @xmath42 , to the fermi gas states @xmath43 .",
    "the structure of @xmath42 is similar to that of the nn interaction : @xmath44 the operators @xmath45 include four central components ( @xmath46 ) ) for @xmath47 and the isoscalar and isovector tensor ones @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "additional spin - orbit components are sometimes introduced , but we will neglect them in this work . with transparent and widely employed notation , the components are also denoted as @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( tensor ) .",
    "realistic correlated basis states are expected to be close to the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "an efficient recipe to choose the correlation functions consists in their variational determination by minimizing the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the correlated ground state : @xmath56 the scalar ( or jastrow ) component @xmath57 heals to unity for @xmath58 , whereas @xmath59 .",
    "the tensor components have the longest range , since they are related to the one - pion exchange potential and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is the hamiltonian associated with a two - nucleon pair ) is a _",
    "well - behaved _ operator healing to @xmath61 at large interparticle distances , like the g - matrix .",
    "the results presented in this work have been obtained using the urbana @xmath62 potential supplemented by the tni three - nucleon interaction @xcite .    at the zero - th ( or _",
    "variational _ ) order of cbf , @xmath63 is obtained using the correlated states ( [ basis ] ) in eq.([tbsf ] ) . the variational estimate is then corrected by inserting perturbative corrections in the correlated basis .",
    "this procedure has been already adopted for many nuclear matter properties and it has been particularly successful in describing inclusive electromagnetic responses at both intermediate and high momentum transfers ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .    in section 2 we will discuss the relationships between the two - nucleon spectral function , the two - nucleon momentum distribution , and the two - body density matrix , @xmath64 .",
    "section 3 will present theory and results for the variational two - nucleon spectral function , as well as the main cbf perturbative corrections , evaluated with realistic interactions .",
    "finally , section 4 is devoted to conclusions and perspectives .",
    "the nuclear matter two - body density matrix @xmath64 is defined as @xmath65 @xmath66 being the ground state wave function . for @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    ", the density matrix reduces to the two - nucleon density distribution @xmath69 , yelding the joint probability of finding two nucleons at positions @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the nuclear matter ground state .",
    "the two - nucleon momentum distribution , i.e. the probability that two nucleons carry momenta @xmath1 and @xmath2 , is related to the two - nucleon spectral function @xmath12 , defined in eq.([tbsf ] ) , through @xmath72    from eqs.([def : dm ] ) and ( [ def : nkk ] ) it follows that @xmath73 can be written in terms of the density matrix according to @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the degeneracy of the system ( in symmetric nuclear matter @xmath75 = 4 ) , @xmath76 is the normalization volume , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it is well known@xcite that in a fermi liquid _ with no long range order _ the two - nucleon momentum distribution factorizes according to @xmath79 where @xmath39 is the single nucleon momentum distribution , defined as @xmath80 the @xmath39 resulting from the nuclear matter calculation of ref.@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "it exhibits a discontinuity at @xmath81 ( the fermi momentum @xmath0 is related to the density @xmath82 through @xmath83 ) , and a tail , extending to very large momenta , reflecting the structure of the nuclear wave function at small interparticle distance .",
    "eq.([factor : nkk ] ) implies that in the a @xmath84 limit @xmath73 contains the same dynamical information carried by @xmath39 .    some insight on the role of short range correlations",
    "can be obtained rewriting @xmath73 in terms of the relative and center of mass momenta of the pair , defined as @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , and studying the quantity @xmath87 fig .",
    "2 illustrates the behaviour of @xmath88 at saturation density ( corresponding to @xmath89 @xmath90 ) , evaluated using the momentum distribution of ref.@xcite ( solid line ) , compared to the prediction of the fermi gas model ( dashed line ) .",
    "the inclusion of nn interactions leads to a quenching of the peak , located at @xmath91 0.7 - 0.8 @xmath90 , and to the appearance of a sizeable tail at @xmath92 .",
    "it is interesting to single out the contributions to @xmath88 corresponding to @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "they are represented in fig . 2 by diamonds , squares and crosses , respectively ( note that the results shown by the crosses have been enhanced by a factor 10 ) .",
    "the @xmath93 component provides about 72 @xmath97 of the normalization of @xmath88 and becomes vanishingly small at @xmath98 . on the other hand , the contributions coming from pairs in which at least one of the nucleon momenta is larger that @xmath0 are much smaller in size ( the curves marked with squares and crosses yield 26 @xmath97 and 2 @xmath97 of the normalization , respectively ) but extend up to @xmath91 4 @xmath90 .",
    "similar results have been recently obtained @xcite using the momentum distribution resulting from a g - matrix perturbation theory calculation @xcite .",

    "note that the basis states are non orthogonal to each other .",
    "orthogonalization can been implemented using the procedure proposed in ref.@xcite , which preserves the diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian between correlated states .",
    "this technique has been succesfully applied to the calculation of the one - body spectral function in ref.@xcite ( hereafter denoted i ) .",
    "the perturbative expansion is obtained separating the nuclear hamiltonian @xmath100 into two parts : @xmath105 , and using standard rayleigh - schrdinger type expansions .",

    "perturbative corrections to the intermediate states @xmath112 are taken into account carrying out an analogous expansion in powers of @xmath113 for the propagator appearing in eq.([2body : green ] ) , as discussed in i :    @xmath114    we will now describe the structure of the @xmath115 ( i.e. variational ) and higher order terms of the cbf perturbative expansion of @xmath12 .      at the lowest order in the perturbative expansion the spectral function",
    "is given by @xmath116 where the correlated states ( [ basis ] ) , and their energies @xmath117 and @xmath118 are used .",

    "only @xmath119 states contribute to @xmath121 , leading to the well known result @xmath122 where @xmath123 denotes the usual step function .",
    "the presence of correlations , besides changing the structure of the @xmath119 contribution in the way we will discuss below , allows for nonvanishing contributions from other intermediate states , with a consequent quenching of the @xmath119 peak since part of the strength is moved to higher excitation energies .",
    "the variational @xmath119 spectral function is given by : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the variational single particle energy and the @xmath119 overlap matrix element , @xmath126 , is @xmath127    the correlated @xmath128 overlap matrix element , @xmath129 , was computed in i using cluster expansion techniques .",

    "the _ linked _ diagrams contribution turn out to be of order 1/a , and therefore vanish in nfinite nuclear matter .",
    "note that the factorization property of the two - nucleon momentum distribution , illustrated by eq.([factor : nkk ] ) , is also a consequence of the fact that _ linked _ diagrams do not contribute in the a@xmath84 limit .",
    "the definitions , as well as the technicalities entering the cluster expansion method can be found in i and in the related references and will not be repeated here . because of the factorization property , in nuclear matter we obtain @xmath133 the cbf expression of @xmath134 being given in i ( eq.(a.19 ) ) .",

    "@xmath144 is no longer delta shaped , but it is rather spread out in energy .",
    "it may be interpreted as a background contribution to be added to the two - quasiparticle part of the spectral function .",
    "the next intermediate state to be considered is the @xmath145 one , whose contribution may be written in terms of products of two squared @xmath142 overlap matrix elements .",
    "however , it is numerically negligible with respect to the @xmath120 term ( several order of magnitudes smaller ) and can be safely neglected .",
    "the above intermediate states completely exhaust the momentum distribution sum rule in nuclear matter at the variational level : @xmath146      the admixture of @xmath24-hole @xmath147-particle correlated states in @xmath148 originate cbf perturbative corrections .",
