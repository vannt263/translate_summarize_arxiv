    "since einstein s discovery of general relativity the search for and the study of exact solutions has been a field of continuous activity . as a consequence",
    "the literature on the subject is huge .",
    "several examples of systematic approaches are described in @xcite .",
    "it is a common feature of all exact solutions that special symmetries are assumed which lead to killing fields on the corresponding manifolds .",
    "the venerable schwarzschild solution with a spherical symmetry is the simplest example , corresponding to an effective @xmath0 theory .",
    "it may be derived by spherically symmetric reduction from the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity .",
    "a @xmath1 metric and a dilaton field are its effective variables @xcite .",
    "the increasing interest in string theories also stimulated studies of @xmath0 covariant theories .",
    "generalizing the ( trivial ) @xmath0 einstein gravity from string theory , e.g. , led to gravity theory in @xmath1 dimensions with nonvanishing torsion @xcite .",
    "string theory also inspired the dilaton black hole @xcite , whose lagrangian closely resembles the one of spherically reduced general relativity .",
    "although its global solution is described by the same carter - penrose diagram as the one for the schwarzschild black hole , the singularity is different , admitting complete null geodesics @xcite . within the past decade also generalized dilaton theories have been studied widely @xcite and , e.g. , their usefulness for modelling ( even globally ) the schwarzschild black hole was shown @xcite .",
    "important progress has been made in the nonperturbative quantum treatment of such theories where the use of a `` light - cone '' gauge for the cartan variables leads to an eddington - finkelstein gauge for the metric .",
    "this allows for an exact path integral in the geometric variables @xcite .",
    "most of the considered @xmath0 gravity models are simple enough to be integrable .",
    "this raises the fundamental question of how to construct the corresponding maximally extended surfaces or global solutions . by this",
    "we mean that any extremal ( or geodesic ) can be continued to an infinite value of its canonical parameter in both directions unless it runs into a curvature singularity at some finite distance .",
    "this is an important issue because almost all coordinate representations of metrics are not maximally extended , indicating that they describe only a small part of a larger solution .",
    "a well - known example is the schwarzschild solution , the maximal extension of which can be covered by kruskal - szekeres coordinates @xcite .",
    "the carter ",
    "penrose diagrams for the most important schwarzschild , reissner ",
    "nordstrom , and kerr solutions were constructed by carter and discuseed in his seminal review @xcite .",
    "his method is based on the explicit construction of overlapping coordinate systems .",
    "it is applicable only to metrics of lorentz signature and thus the universality of the method is unclear .",
    "a systematic and equivalent method for the construction of maximally extended solutions was proposed in @xcite for @xmath0 gravity with torsion in the conformal gauge .",
    "it is based on the analysis of extremals and does not use overlapping coordinate systems .",
    "the disadvantage of the approach is that the continuity of the metric was proved only up to second order on the horizons .",
    "a more general approach based on a poisson - sigma - model formulation of generalized dilaton - type models and @xmath0 gravity with torsion has been developed in @xcite .",
    "it uses overlapping coordinate systems and proves that the maximally extended solutions are smooth .",
    "these rules may be used for a large class of @xmath0 metrics without explicit construction of kruskal - szekeres - like coordinate systems and without concern for smoothness of the resulting maximally extended solution ; hence it has been proved in a general case .",
    "a systematic construction of the maximally extended solutions for the euclidean signature metrics was proposed in @xcite .",
    "starting from einstein s gravity in four dimensions , we make a special ansatz for a metric reducing the problem to a two - dimensional one , and then construct all corresponding maximally extended solutions .",
    "we assume that the four - dimensional space - time manifold @xmath2 with local coordinates @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is a warped product of two surfaces @xmath5 .",
    "this means that in a suitable coordinate system @xmath6 , ( @xmath7 ) , ( @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are coordinates on the surfaces @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , the four - dimensional metric has a block diagonal form @xmath13 here and in what follows we use the hat symbol to denote geometrical quantities which refer to the whole spacetime @xmath2 , whereas symbols without hats are used for @xmath0 surfaces . accordingly , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are metric tensors and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are scalar ( dilaton ) fields on the surfaces @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "greek letters from the beginning ( @xmath18 ) and the middle ( @xmath19 ) of the alphabet always refer to coordinates on the first and the second surface .    for definiteness we specify @xmath11 to be a pseudo - riemannian manifold with a lorentz signature metric and @xmath12 a riemannian manifold with positive or negative definite metric .",
    "then up to a permutation of the first two coordinates the signature of the metric on @xmath2 will be either @xmath20 or @xmath21 depending on the sign of @xmath22 .",
    "these solutions are related to each other by an inversion of the metric @xmath23 which is a symmetry transformation of the einstein equations in the absence of matter fields .",
    "both surfaces are assumed to be orientable .",
    "note that we do not assume initially any symmetry of the metric ( [ emetbl ] ) . only as the consequence of einstein s equations and the requirement of completeness we find that any solution of the form ( [ emetbl ] ) must be highly symmetric    many well - known metrics of general relativity have this form .",
    "for example , for the schwarzschild solution the surface @xmath12 is a @xmath0 sphere @xmath24 and @xmath11 is represented by the carter - penrose diagram for a black hole @xcite . for some recent work on warped metrics cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as far as their local properties are concerned all solutions discussed below are well known and belong to type @xmath25 according to petrov s classification @xcite .",
    "also the global structure of spherically symmetric solutions has been discussed already in @xcite .",
    "the global structure of the planar and lobachevsky plane solutions were described quite recently @xcite .",
    "the global structure of the hyperbolic and minkowski plane solutions constructed in the present paper is new .",
    "the physical interpretation relies on the global structure .",
    "we find that the solutions describe domain walls of curvature singularities , cosmic strings surrounded by domain walls , and others . in this construction",
    "we use the teqnique of @xcite .",
    "the metric ( [ emetbl ] ) allows us to solve explicitly the four - dimensional vacuum einstein equations with a cosmological constant @xmath26 @xmath27 and to construct the possible ( maximally extended ) global solutions . in section 2",
    "we perform the reduction of einstein s equations for the metric ( [ emetbl ] ) .",
    "the einstein equations severely restrict the dilaton fields ; in fact , at least one of them must be constant .",
    "hence solutions are grouped into three main classes , corresponding to the dilaton fields being both constant ( case _ a _ ) , only @xmath28 ( case _ b _ ) , or only @xmath29 ( case _ c _ ) . as shown in section  3 , case",
    "_ a _ leads to solutions of a rather simple type ( product of two constant curvature surfaces ) .",
    "spatially symmetric solutions ( case _ b _ ) are the subject of section  4 . here the well - known spherically and planar solutions are rederived . however , also a class of solutions which are warped products of some pseudo - riemanian surface with a lobachevsky plane or with a higher genus riemanian surface having o(1,2 ) as symmetry group appear .",
    "they are physically interpreted as @xmath30 wormhole solutions , where @xmath30 is the number of handles on the corresponding riemann surface .",
    "it should be noted that in this connection that planar and lobachevsky plane solutions of black hole type recently attracted growing interest @xcite . in section 5 for the case _ c _ ( @xmath31 ) we have constructed new vacuum solutions to the einstein equations which seem to be unknown at the global level .",
    "again their global properties are discussed in detail .",
    "the physical interpretation of these solutions is quite interesting .",
    "they describe cosmic strings and domain walls of curvature singularities . in section 6",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the inverse metric to ( [ emetbl ] ) is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are inverse matrices to @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the components of the christoffel symbols become @xmath35    with the definition of the curvature tensor @xmath36 the components of the ricci tensor , @xmath37 , are @xmath38 where @xmath39 the covariant derivative acting on the scalar fields @xmath40 coincides with the partial derivative while it acts on vectors on @xmath11 as @xmath41 and analogously in @xmath12 . now the scalar curvature , @xmath42 , becomes @xmath43 with the obvious shorthand notations @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 are scalar curvatures of the surfaces @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "thus the einstein equations ( [ einseq ] ) for the metric ( [ emetbl ] ) reduce to @xmath47 equations ( [ eineaa ] ) , ( [ einemm ] ) are rewritten in a more suitable form by extracting the traces which yield scalar curvatures for the surfaces @xmath48 the traceless parts of eqs .",

    "equations ( [ einnaa ] ) and ( [ einnmm ] ) contain functions which depend only on @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , while coordinates in the other equations ( [ eineam ] ) , ( [ escuru ] ) , and ( [ escurv ] ) are mixed .",

    "thus the classification of solutions for @xmath274 is the same as for the spherically symmetric case if one interchanges space and time coordinates on the @xmath11 surface , @xmath281 , and changes the sign of cosmological constant and mass .",
    "for example , the analog of the schwarzschild solution is obtained for @xmath56 and @xmath215 . for",
    "homogeneous and static conformal blocks the line element is @xmath282 @xmath283 the corresponding carter - penrose diagram must be turned by the angle @xmath258 .",
    "there are left and right static singularities at @xmath218 .",
    "the properties of this global solution are similar to the properties of two static singularities in the spherically symmetric case , but with a different `` asymptotic '' behaviour : the space - time is now asymptotically flat at infinite past and infinite future ( both limits correspond to @xmath249 ) .",
    "it is not easy to imagine a space ( a time slice of the four - dimensional space - time defined by the equation @xmath284 ) for @xmath274 . in an uncompactified version",
    "it is the product of an interval ( finite or infinite depending on the values of @xmath26 and @xmath117 ) and the lobachevsky plane . in a compactified version",
    "when @xmath12 is a higher genus riemann surface one may interpret this class of solutions as describing a set of wormholes , the number of wormholes being exactly the number of handles of the corresponding riemann surface .",
    "the same topology will be inherited by a horizon . in the same way one may analyse the other solutions for @xmath274 , but we shall not repeat this analysis here .",
    "whereas solutions of the last section are known , the global properties of the solutions to be discussed now seem to be new . their topological structure is @xmath285 , where @xmath59 is a one - sheet hyperboloid embedded in three - dimensional minkowski space ( or its universal covering , resp . ) and @xmath12 is a euclidean surface to be specified below .",
    "this class of vacuum solutions to the einstein equations yields solutions with curvature or conical singularities located along space - like strings or domain walls of curvature singularity evolving in time .",
    "all singularities are naked ones .",
    "case @xmath286 is very similar to the spatially symmetric solutions ( case @xmath287 ) but has important new features .",
    "first , we can not restrict ourselves to positive definite metrics @xmath15 on @xmath12 because one of the einstein equations ( [ escurv ] ) is not invariant under the transformation @xmath288 for a fixed @xmath22 . note that in the case @xmath289 the transformation @xmath290 may be always compensated by exchanging space and time coordinates on @xmath11 , @xmath281 leaving equation ( [ escuru ] ) invariant .",
    "this is impossible for the euclidean signature metric on @xmath12 .",
    "therefore we fix @xmath291 to have the same signs in the equation as in the case @xmath83 , but allow the metric @xmath15 to be both positive or negative definite .    to obtain solutions of equations ( [ escuru])([einnmm ] )",
    "one may follow the same steps as before replacing everywhere @xmath22 by @xmath49 and @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "therefore we merely sketch the whole procedure stressing only particularly important points resulting from the euclidean signature . now",
    "the conformal gauge is @xmath292 where @xmath293 is a function of the complex coordinates on @xmath12 , @xmath294 where @xmath295 , and @xmath296 . in the total line element @xmath297",
    "@xmath298 is a constant curvature metric on @xmath11 given , for example , by ( [ ecoclm ] ) .",
    "for the two unknown functions @xmath49 and @xmath299 we have , instead of equations ( [ egcoga])([egcogc ] ) , @xmath300 the solution of ( [ egcoha ] ) and ( [ egcohb ] ) is @xmath301 , @xmath302 , and @xmath303 where the upper and lower signs correspond to positive and negative definite metrics on @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath49 and @xmath299 depend on either @xmath304 or @xmath305 .",
    "however , due to the rotational symmetry of ( [ ecogae ] ) these two choices are equivalent and we assume for definitness that @xmath49 and @xmath299 are functions of @xmath304",
    ". then the laplacian is @xmath306 ( no @xmath114 sign ! ) . now instead of ( [ esecom ] ) we get @xmath307 with the same sign conventions as in ( [ ehintk ] ) . using the result that the curvature has a true singularity at @xmath308 we restrict the range of @xmath49 to positive values",
    ". then equation ( [ esecok ] ) may be integrated to give @xmath309 where @xmath310 @xmath117 being an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "although it can not be interpreted as a mass we use the same notation as before to simplify comparison . with the parametrization @xmath311 for positive @xmath49 a general hyperbolic solution to the einstein equations",
    "is , finally , @xmath312 where @xmath313 and the function @xmath314 is defined by the equation @xmath315 the modulus sign in this equation means that in each case there are two solutions @xmath316 and @xmath317 . from equation ( [ egshty ] ) it is clear that for @xmath149 and @xmath160 the metric on @xmath12 is negative and positive definite , respectively . taking the function @xmath142 as a coordinate ( [ egshty ] ) can be written in schwarzschild - like form @xmath318    the resulting hyperbolic solution has three killing vector fields generating the symmetry group @xmath319 of the one - sheet hyperboloid of constant curvature and one killing vector field @xmath320 for the @xmath12 surface .",
    "calculations similar to the @xmath83 case yield explicit expression for the scalar curvature on @xmath12 , @xmath321 and for the invariant eigenvalue of the weyl tensor we get the same expression as given in case @xmath287 by ( [ ectsqu ] ) .",
    "this justifies the range of @xmath322 .",
    "the global structure of a hyperbolic solution ( [ egshty ] ) or ( [ egssty ] ) depends on the zeros of @xmath147 : @xmath323 the construction of maximally extended solutions requires a careful analysis of the extremals for a given metric .",
    "the local solutions of @xmath0 gravity with torsion have the same structure and therefore the analysis performed in @xcite may be applied directly in the present case . to save space",
    "we only formulate the rules of how to construct maximally extended euclidean solutions from the lorentzian ones :    * each of the lorentz signature solution decomposes into disconnected solutions for the euclidean metric along horizons . that is",
    "each conformal block by itself represents one maximally extended solution in the euclidean case . *",
    "homogeneous , @xmath160 , and static , @xmath149 , conformal blocks represent surfaces of positive and negative definite metrics , respectively . *",
    "each of the horizons shrinks to a point in the euclidean case and lies at a finite distance for a simple zero of @xmath147 and at infinite distance for a higher zero of @xmath147 .",
    "* the completeness or incompleteness of curvature singularities is the same as before .    to obtain a maximally extended euclidean surface",
    "@xmath12 one must identify the points @xmath120 and @xmath324 along the killing direction @xcite for a simple zero .",
    "the obtained surface is not a cylinder because its circumference shrinks to zero if one approaches a horizon , that is the zero of @xmath147 . in general , one gets a conical singularity there with the deficit angle @xmath325 where @xmath326 denotes the derivative .",
    "hence the necessary and sufficient condition for the absence of a conical singularity is @xmath327 if this equation holds then we get a smooth surface at this point and the whole space - time may be totally smooth ( if there are no curvature or further conical singularities ) . for a double",
    "zero the points corresponding to this horizon lie at an infinite distance and one does not need to bother about conical singularities . again",
    "the classification of global hyperbolic solutions depends on the number and type of zeros of @xmath147 defined by the constants @xmath64 , @xmath26 , and @xmath117 .",
    "let us note that the cases @xmath148 and @xmath274 may be obtained from each other by permutation of the first two coordinates .",
    "we choose @xmath274 to retain the same expression for @xmath147 as for spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "the line element for the one sheet hyperboloid ( [ ecoclm ] ) in angular coordinates reads @xmath328 so that the corresponding @xmath270 line element becomes @xmath329 where @xmath330 is given by ( [ edefus ] ) again .",
    "it has precisely the same form as for the kottler solution @xcite but here it enters the euclidean part of the metric .",
    "note that now the surface @xmath331 or its universal covering space is completely smooth . the surface @xmath12 may have a negative ( @xmath149 ) or positive ( @xmath160 ) definite metric . for negative definite metric",
