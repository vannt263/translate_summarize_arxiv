    "bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) make up the two classes in which the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) known as  blazars \" are divided .",
    "they share extreme properties , as noticeable flux variability at all wavelengths , from the radio to the @xmath2-ray energies , and on a variety of timescales , ranging from hours to years .",
    "their radio - to - uv ( in some cases also x - ray ) emission is mainly non - thermal , polarised synchrotron radiation from a relativistic jet pointing at a small angle to the line of sight , which explains the superluminal motions inferred from the radio images and the extremely high brightness temperature implied by fast radio variability .",
    "according to the classical definition by @xcite and @xcite , the distinguishing feature of bl lacs is that their spectra show optical emission lines with a rest - frame equivalent width smaller than 5  , if any .",
    "this classification is however unsatisfactory , as objects can change class depending on the level of non - thermal continuum from the jet .",
    "even bl lacertae itself was found not to behave as a bl lac in faint states @xcite .",
    "new criteria to separate bl lacs from fsrqs have recently been proposed by @xcite and @xcite , which are based on the luminosity of the broad - line region in eddington units and the ionization state , respectively .",
    "differences between the two blazar classes were observed in the wavelength - dependent behaviour of the optical polarisation , when present ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "bl lacs show increasing polarisation toward the blue , likely due to causes intrinsic to the jet emitting region .",
    "an opposite behaviour characterises fsrqs , because of the dilution effect toward the blue produced by the unpolarised thermal radiation from the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "moreover , very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations revealed different polarisation structures , with bl lacs exhibiting polarisation position angles in the radio knots parallel , while fsrqs perpendicular , to the jet structural axis ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "from the point of view of parsec - scale jet morphology and kinematics , @xcite found that bl lacs have in general wider and more bent jets than fsrqs , and that transverse motion of inner knots in bl lacs is more pronounced than the radial one , which would suggest a helical jet structure .",
    "variations of the innermost jet position angle in time are larger in fsrqs than in bl lacs @xcite .",
    "besides the classification into fsrqs and bl lacs , the latter sources are further divided into low - energy peaked ( lbl ) and high - energy peaked ( hbl ) bl lacs , depending on the frequency at which the synchrotron emission component peaks in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the relation between lbls and hbls is still a matter of debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "observations by the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ) satellite @xcite led to the development of a new diagnostic tool for agn .",
    "in particular , it was noticed that blazars occupy a well - defined region of the @xmath3 versus @xmath4 planem , respectively .",
    "these @xmath5 , together with the magnitude zero - points , are calibrated with respect to vega @xcite . ] : the so - called _ wise _ blazar strip @xcite , which includes a subregion delineating @xmath2-ray emitting blazars @xcite .",
    "this was used by @xcite and @xcite to recognise blazar candidates among the unidentified @xmath2-ray sources detected by the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the _ fermi _ satellite .    using _ wise _ data",
    ", @xcite concluded that there is no evidence of a dust torus in bl lacs , which implies structural differences between the two types of blazars , possibly driven by different accretion rate regimes .",
    "statistical analysis of the blazar properties is facilitated by the presence of an on - line catalogue of blazars , the roma - bzcat @xcite , as well as of many catalogues resulting from multifrequency surveys , from both ground and space , as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , or the _ wise _ all - sky database .",
    "however , generally surveys give information on a single state of each source , while blazars are rapidly and unpredictably variable objects at all frequencies .        on the other hand ,",
    "the long - term multifrequency behaviour of blazars can be studied in detail only for a handful of sources , and this is usually achieved by large collaborations that share the observing effort .",
    "the whole earth blazar telescope ( webt ) was born in 1997 as an international collaboration of astronomers devoted to blazar studies .",
    "the advent of the new - generation satellites for @xmath2-ray astronomy , astro - rivelatore gamma ad immagini leggero ( agile ) and _ fermi _ ( formerly glast ) , led the webt to organise a long - term monitoring of 28 blazars , 14 bl lacs and 14 fsrqs , which were selected among the @xmath2-loud , optically brightest and potentially most interesting sources for coordinated low - energy and @xmath2-ray studies .",
    "this long - term monitoring project was called the glast - agile support program ( gasp ) and started its activity in 2007 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we first put into context the gasp sources by comparing their infrared properties with those of the other classified blazars .",
    "then we present the results of the near - ir monitoring of the gasp sources performed at the campo imperatore ( italy ) and teide ( canary islands , spain ) observatories in 20082013 .",
    "we analyse their flux density variability , colours and seds with special attention to the differences between bl lac objects and fsrqs .",
    "tables [ gasp_bllacs ] and [ gasp_fsrqs ] list the gasp sources , divided into the two blazars classes , according to the classical definition adopted in the bzcat catalogue . for each source we give in column 1 the iau name , in column 2 the name with which the source is most often indicated in the literature , and in column 3 the bzcat identification .",
    "the source redshift is reported in column 4 .",
    "we adopted the redshift values of the bzcat catalogue , but in the case of 0716 + 714 , for which we set @xmath6 following @xcite , and of 0735 + 178 , for which we set @xmath7 after @xcite . finally , column 5 gives the galactic reddening obtained from the galactic dust extinction service at irsa .",
    "reddening is particularly important ( @xmath8 ) for the bl lacs 0954 + 658 , 2200 + 420 , and 2344 + 514 , and for the fsrqs 0420@xmath9014 , 0528 + 134 , 1510@xmath9089 , and 2251 + 158 .    [",

    "[ teide_bllacs1 ] and [ teide_bllacs2 ] we show the near - ir light curves of the gasp bl lacs , while in figs .  [ teide_fsrqs1 ] and [ teide_fsrqs2 ] those of the gasp fsrqs are displayed . in a few cases ( 0219 + 428 , 0851 + 202 , 1226 + 023 , and 2344 + 514 ) we found offsets due to different source calibration between the campo imperatore and teide data , and corrected for them .    to quantify variability ,",
    "magnitudes are converted into flux densities as explained in sect .",
    "[ compa ] and then the mean fractional variation is calculated .",
    "this is defined as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mean flux , @xmath12 the variance of the flux , and @xmath13 the mean square uncertainty of the fluxes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the advantage of this quantity is that it takes into account the effect of errors , which produce apparent variability .",
    "tables 3 and 4 report the mean fractional variation for the gasp bl lacs and fsrqs , respectively . for a given object ,",
    "this quantity obviously depends on the considered period and on the amount of data collected .",
    "only one bl lac ( 0235 + 164 ) and 3 fsrqs ( 0420@xmath9014 , 2230 + 114 , and 2251 + 158 ) have @xmath14 , and 0235 + 164 is the most variable source . notice that 0235 + 164 has sometimes been claimed to belong to the fsrqs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the values of the mean fractional variation indicate that fsrqs are typically more variable than bl lacs .",
    "average @xmath15 values for the whole bl lac sample in each of the near - ir bands are around 0.35% , while they are @xmath16% in the case of fsrqs . moreover ,",
    "in general bl lacs are slightly more variable in the @xmath17 band and fsrqs in the @xmath18 band . this recalls what happens in the optical domain , where bl lacs are generally more variable in the blue than in the red , while for fsrqs the opposite is true .",
    "the smaller variability of fsrqs toward the blue is a clue in favour of an additional emission component , i.e.  thermal emission from the disc ( showing as a  big blue bump \" in the sed ) and broad line region ( blr , producing a  little blue bump \" in the sed ) .",
    "indeed , the contribution from this ",
    "blue \" component is expected to extend into the near - ir band , behaving as a base - level under which the flux can not fall , and affecting the @xmath17 flux density more than the @xmath18 one .",
    "to analyse the near - infrared spectral variability , we first binned the @xmath17 , @xmath19 , and @xmath18 data of each observatory acquired within 30 minutes and then coupled the binned data with error less than 0.1 mag to build @xmath20 and @xmath21 colour indices .",
    "figures [ colcol_bllacs ] and [ colcol_fsrqs ] show the colour variability of the gasp sources in the @xmath20 versus @xmath21 plot , compared to the 2mass value ( see fig .",
    "[ 2mass_ext ] ) .",
    "correction for galactic extinction has been performed as explained in sect .",
    "[ compa ] . in tables 3 and 4",
    "we report colour indices average values , their standard deviations and mean fractional variations ( see eq .  1 ) .",
    "the latter are often imaginary numbers for bl lac objects , which means that the corresponding colour index variability is dominated by noise .",
    "when this is not the case , the value is however low , in the range 17% .",
    "this is also true for 0235 + 164 , the source with the largest flux variability , which nonetheless is the bl lac showing the most noticeable spectral changes . in general , larger near - ir spectral variability characterises fsrqs because of the interplay between synchrotron and quasar - like emission components , the latter including contributions from the accretion disc , broad line region , and torus ( see sect .",
    "[ sed ] ) .",
    "exceptions are 3c 273 , pks 1510@xmath9089 , and 3c 345 . the sources exhibiting the largest colour indices changes are 3c 454.3 and cta 102 .",
    "by looking at figs .",
    "[ colcol_bllacs ] and [ colcol_fsrqs ] one can see that sometimes the 2mass value is outside the region where most of our points collect .",
    "this may partly reflect cross - calibration problems , but may also indicate an even larger variability .",
    "two sources show clear trends in the colour - colour diagram .",
    "the anticorrelation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the 3c 273 plot suggests that there is a spectral break in the @xmath19 band .",
    "in contrast , a correlation is visible in the colour - colour plot of 3c 454.3 , where the lower - left group of points refer to the source faint state from 2011 onward , while the upper - right group of points come from the bright state before 2011 .",
    "the colour - colour plot then tell us that the near - ir spectrum is bluer in faint states and redder in bright states .",
    "a redder - when - brighter trend has already been noticed when analysing the optical spectrum of this source ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "these spectral behaviours will become clearer in the next section , where spectral energy distributions are presented and interpreted in terms of different emission contributions .",
    "in this section we present the infrared - to - optical spectral energy distributions of the gasp sources .",
    "they are built with the survey data already presented in sect .",
    "[ compa ] ( _ wise _ , 2mass , sdss ) , literature data , and the results of our near - ir monitoring at campo imperatore and teide .",
    "notice that a _ wise _ single exposure source database is available , containing multiple observations of the gasp sources . however , the use of this database is discouraged because it includes all single exposure images regardless of their quality , so we did not consider it . from the literature we extracted data from the infrared astronomical satellite ( _ iras _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the _ spitzer _ satellite @xcite .",
    "_ herschel _ data for 3c 454.3 are from @xcite . for 3c 273 and 3c 371",
    "we used the optical spectra acquired at the telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) by @xcite , which are available on the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . in a few cases we reported seds from papers involving data from the gasp - webt collaboration for a more accurate modelling : @xcite for pks 1510 - 089 ; @xcite for 4c 38.41 , @xcite for 3c 454.3 .",
    "although in general the seds do not contain simultaneous data , they can help us understand what are the photons sources intervening in this frequency range . in figs .",
    "[ sed_bllacs ] and [ sed_fsrqs ] we show the seds together with model fits that take into account the possible emission contributions :    * synchrotron radiation from the jet , which is modelled as a log - parabola following @xcite , @xmath22 = \\log [ \\nu_{\\rm p } f(\\nu_{\\rm p } ) ] - b \\ , ( \\log \\nu - \\log \\nu_{\\rm p})^2 ,   \\label{logpa}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the frequency of the synchrotron peak @xmath24 ; * host galaxy emission , for which we consider the swire template of a 13 gyr old elliptical galaxy ; * qso - like nuclear contribution from accretion disc , broad line region , and dust torus , all included in the qso1 swire templates , i.e.  templates of qso with broad emission lines ; * thermal radiation from a black body to simulate dust signatures in the infrared or to enhance the accretion disc flux in fsrqs .    in the plots presented for bl lac objects in fig",
    ".  [ sed_bllacs ] , sometimes catalogue data are shifted in @xmath25 ( the shift is marked by arrows ) in order to simulate simultaneous seds that can ease the modelling task .",
    "although this is not strictly correct because the spectral shape may change with flux , it is justified by the small spectral variability that we noticed in sect .",
    "[ colour ] for bl lac objects .",
    "fits to the seds of bl lac objects require a synchrotron emission , plus the contribution of a host galaxy for the nearest objects .",
    "this is dominant in the near - ir in the cases of mkn 501 and 1es 2344 + 514 , and it is very important for mkn 421 and 3c 371 . for only two bl lacs ( 3c 66a and mkn 421 ) the far - infrared data from _ iras _ suggest the presence of dust , as already noticed by @xcite .",
    "in general , the fsrqs seds need a synchrotron plus a qso - like emission contribution due to accretion disc , broad line region , and torus .",
    "there are three qso1 templates in the swire database .",
    "we first used tqso1 because it shows a prominent h@xmath26 line , which is known to be present in the spectra of our objects .",
    "however , its high ir / optical flux ratio ( rest frame ) appears inadequate to model some fsrqs seds , so we built a composite qso1 template , combining the higher - frequency part of tqso1 , i.e.  its disc plus blr emission , with the lower - frequency part of bqso1 , representing a fainter torus emission .",
    "moreover , in some fsrqs a brighter disc is required , which we obtained by adding a black - body component to the qso1 template . in the following we comment on single source features .",
    "the model fit indicates that the synchrotron peak falls at optical frequencies .",
    "as already noticed by @xcite , there is good evidence for thermal dust emission , which we fitted with a blackbody spectrum with temperature of @xmath27 .",
    "this is the farthest among the gasp - webt bl lac objects and has often revealed an fsrq - like behaviour ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as discussed in sect",
    "[ colour ] , notwithstanding the strong variability in the near - ir , the spectral slope does not change much .",
    "there is no hint of a @xmath17-band flux excess due to the contribution of the h@xmath26 emission line even in the faintest states .",
    "this means that blr emission is undetected in our observations .",
    "data are compatible with a shift of the synchrotron peak toward higher energies when the flux increases , as shown by the model fits .      the near - ir data from the gasp indicate a steep spectrum , which appears steeper in faint states ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the 2mass spectrum is flat .",
    "_ iras _ data likely belong to a fainter state .      by shifting in @xmath25 the same log - parabola model , we obtained reasonable fits of two different brightness states traced by sdss and _ wise _ data , respectively .",
    "the model fit accounts for a bright state marked by sdss , 2mass , and the lowest _ iras _ data points .",
    "the lower model fit reproduces the _ wise _ and 2mass sed and its shape also agrees with the sdss spectrum .",
    "the upper model is obtained by shifting vertically the previous one and goes through the scattered _ iras _ data .      as in the case of 0716 + 714 , the near - ir data from the gasp show a steep spectrum , in contrast with the 2mass spectral slope .",
    "this is an hbl , whose synchrotron peak lies in the x - ray band , with impressive frequency shifts @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , the host galaxy has a magnitude @xmath28 and contributes up to @xmath29 ( for a 10  aperture radius and good seeing conditions ) to the source photometry .",
    "the 2mass data are from the all - sky extended source image server and show a faint state of the source .",
    "an infrared excess is visible in the _ iras _ data suggesting thermal emission from dust , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "we then interpreted the sed as a superposition of a jet spectrum , host galaxy contribution , and a black - body dust component with temperature of about 23 k. the model fit presented in fig .",

    "july 2007 ( plus signs ) and january 2008 ( crosses ) ; observations with the different instruments ( irs , irac , and mips ) are not simultaneous and this explains the discontinuities of the spectra .",

    "this is the most southern among the gasp sources .",
    "the synchrotron peak of the model fit falls in the uv .",
    "this is one of the most studied sources by the gasp - webt ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the host galaxy has @xmath33 @xcite , and affects the source photometry in the near - ir and optical bands , especially in faint states .",
    "this is the third hbl in the gasp sample .",
    "its near - ir  optical spectrum is dominated by the host galaxy , whose brightness is @xmath34 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ sed_bllacs ] we show a fit to the faint state traced by the 2mass data .",
    "the jet contribution is superposed to a host galaxy contribution corresponding to the contaminating flux entering an aperture radius of 3 arcsec when the fwhm is 3 arcsec .",
    "the near - ir data from the gasp indicate a steep spectrum , with a flux excess in @xmath17 band during faint states . indeed , the source redshift implies a contribution from the h@xmath26 emission line in this band , as shown by the swire tqso1 template .",
    "the lack of medium or far - infrared data in a low state prevents us to derive information on the torus emission .",
    "the near - ir spectra traced by both 2mass and gasp data in faint states reveal a concave shape , suggesting the transition from a spectrum dominated by jet emission to a spectrum dominated by qso - like emission .",
    "the h@xmath26 and h@xmath35 emission lines affect the @xmath18 and @xmath19 band fluxes , respectively . modelling the near - ir spectrum with a log - parabola plus",
    "the swire tqso1 template would overproduce the mid - infrared flux detected by _",
    "wise _ because of the prominent infrared contribution from the dust torus .",
    "this implies that the ir / optical flux ratio of the qso - like contribution in this source must be smaller .",
    "we thus combined the disc+blr component of the tqso1 template at @xmath36   ( rest frame ) with the torus component of the bqso1 template at @xmath37  .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ sed_fsrqs ] as a grey solid line .",
    "however , this composite template can not explain the curvature of the near - ir spectrum at intermediate flux levels , which requires a brighter disc .",
    "we thus added a black - body component ( grey dashed line in fig .",
    "[ sed_fsrqs ] ) to the composite template to obtain a final qso - like contribution ( blue solid line ) that , once added to the jet emission ( dot - dashed blue line ) , can produce a reasonable fit ( black solid line ) to the observing data .",
    "this implies a softening of the optical spectrum with increasing flux , confirming the guess by @xcite .      as in the 0528 + 134 case ,",
    "the signature of a qso - like emission contribution is already evident in the near - ir spectrum .",
    "in particular , the @xmath17-band excess is due to the contribution of the broad h@xmath26 emission line , while the h@xmath35 line enters the sdss @xmath30 band , and the mg ii and fe lines , giving rise to the little blue bump , contribute to the flux between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 bands .",

    "in particular , _ iso _ observed the source in two epochs : 1996 december 6 ( red circles ) and 1997 december 18 ( grey circles ) . according to @xcite",
    ", these data may reveal a thermal dust bump , which however is not confirmed by the _ iras _ data .",
    "_ spitzer _ spectra are from @xcite ; the bright state was observed in 2005 july , while the low state was observed in 2006 december .",
    "data from the irac detector are plotted as plus signs , those from irs as crosses ; the two instruments were not pointing at the source at the same time .",
    "observations by _ herschel _ on 2010 november 30  december 1 and 2011 january 8 @xcite are shown as red stars .",
    "to better characterise the interplay between the jet and qso - like emission , we also plotted three infrared - to - uv seds ( small filled and empty red circles ) taken from @xcite .",
    "the highest and intermediate seds were built with gasp - webt and _ swift _ data acquired during a multifrequency campaign on this source ; the lowest sed is originally from @xcite .",
    "the qso - like emission signature is best visible in this faint state , where the flux excess in the @xmath17/uv@xmath46 bands is the signature of the h@xmath26/ly@xmath26 broad emission line ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the spectral curvature in the optical band is due to the little blue bump .",
    "the models displayed in fig .  [ sed_fsrqs ] show possible fits to the seds , where a jet emission component is superimposed to a qso - like contribution with enhanced disc emission .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the near - ir properties of blazars . the _ wise _ and 2mass catalogues allow us to study the statistical properties of the whole class and in particular to investigate the differences between the two blazar subtypes of fsrqs and bl lac objects .",
    "the addition of the sdss database makes it possible to complete the information on blazar seds around the peak of the synchrotron emission component .",
    "however , blazars are characterised by strong variability at all wavelengths and a deeper understanding of the blazar phenomenon can be achieved only through long - term monitoring , which is possible only for a limited number of sources .",
    "we have thus considered the 28 blazars ( 14 fsrqs and 14 bl lac objects ) that belong to the target list of the gasp project of the webt , and for which continuous monitoring was performed since the project birth in 2007 .",
    "data in the near - ir come from the campo imperatore and teide observatories .    among the blazars in the _",
    "wise _ , 2mass , and sdss catalogues , the gasp sources are well distributed in infrared colours and redshifts , but generally have high infrared  optical fluxes , so they represent a mini - sample of bright blazars .",
    "we have shown @xmath47 light curves of these objects , revealing noticeable variability for most of them . in average ,",
    "the mean fractional flux variation is greater for fsrqs than for bl lac objects , with the notable exception of ao 0235 + 164 , which was found to be the most variable object in the considered period .",
    "indeed , this blazar has often shown a behaviour more similar to fsrqs than to bl lacs .",
    "we have compared variability in the three near - ir bands : while in general the bl lacs show more variability at higher frequency , the reverse is true for fsrqs .",
    "this is the consequence of the different emission components overlapping in this band .",
    "colour variability is very small in bl lac objects , not exceeding a few percent .",
    "the nearly achromaticity of the near - ir emission of bl lacs is a characteristic of the dominant synchrotron jet emission .",
    "in contrast , the larger spectral changes exhibited by fsrqs are due to the overlapping between synchrotron and quasar - like emission components .",
    "we have built infrared seds of these sources , including the results of the gasp - webt near - ir monitoring plus archive and literature data from _ wise _ , 2mass , _ iras _ , _ iso _ , _ spitzer _ , and _ herschel _ , as well as optical information from the sdss and literature .",
    "although these seds do not contain simultaneous data , as would be desirable for these variable objects , they can nevertheless help us understand the interplay among the various emission contributions : synchrotron radiation from the jet , qso - like emission including torus , disc , and blr radiation , and radiation from the host galaxy .",
    "we have modelled the synchrotron emission with a log - parabola , while for the host galaxy and qso - like contributions we have adopted swire templates , with the possible inclusion of black - body components to simulate additional dust emission or enhanced disc emission .",
    "we have used single temperature black - bodies for these additional components instead of multi - temperature black - bodies or dusty galaxy templates to keep the interpretation as simple as possible .",
    "a strong host galaxy signature has been found in the sed of mkn 421 , and especially in those of mkn 501 and 1es 2344 + 514 , the three closest and high - energy peaked bl lacs , which were the first ones to be detected at tev energies . at nearly the same redshift of 1es 2344 + 514 lies 3c 371 , which shows an important host galaxy contribution too .",
    "a bit farther , bl lacertae does not show evidence of host galaxy in its sed , even if we know that the host affects the source photometry in faint states ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "apart from the above cases , all other bl lac seds are well fitted by a synchrotron component ; the only indications for the presence of dust thermal emission are found for 3c 66a and mkn 421 , as previously reported @xcite .    for many fsrqs , the near - ir band signs the transition from a non - thermal , synchrotron - dominated emission to a thermal , qso - like dominated emission .",
    "the cases of pks 0528 + 134 and 4c 71.07 , whose _ wise _ data were acquired in very faint states , suggest that torus emission is relatively weak in fsrqs . a particularly bright disc is required to explain the seds of 9 out of the 14 gasp fsrqs . from the sed fits we can derive disc luminosities at the peak of @xmath4846.6 [ @xmath49 , the highest values characterising 4c 71.07 , pks 0528 + 134 , and 4c 38.41 , which are the most distant objects . for comparison , various authors analysing different qso samples obtained mean values ranging from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , with large dispersion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "hence , our fsrqs have accretion discs with luminosities in the same range as qso , up to the highest values . in the case of 3c 273 ,",
    "an extra dust contribution peaking at @xmath52 [ hz ] is needed to explain the near - to - medium infrared sed .",
