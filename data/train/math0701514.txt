    "let @xmath0 be a locally compact hausdorff space ; and suppose we are given @xmath1 proper continuous self maps @xmath2 for @xmath3 , i.e. , a _ multivariable dynamical system_. in this paper , we develop a theory of conjugacy algebras for such multivariable dynamical systems .",
    "one of the goals is to develop connections between the dynamics of multivariable systems and fundamental concepts in operator algebra theory .",
    "one of the main outcomes of this work is that the classification and representation theory of conjugacy algebras is intimately connected to piecewise conjugacy and generalized recurrence for multivariable systems .    in the case of a dynamical system with a single map @xmath13 ,",
    "there is one natural prototypical operator algebra associated to it , the semicrossed product of the system . as we shall see , the case @xmath14 offers a far greater diversity of examples .",
    "it happens that there are various non - isomorphic algebras that can serve as a prototype for the conjugacy algebra of the system .",
    "the algebras should contain an isometric copy of @xmath15 ; plus they need to contain generators @xmath16 which encode the covariance relations of the maps @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to impose norm conditions to be able to talk about a _ universal operator algebra _ for the system .",
    "the choice of these conditions creates two natural choices for the appropriate universal operator algebra for the system : the case in which the generators are either isometric , producing the _ semicrossed product _ , or row isometric , producing the _ tensor algebra_.    the main goal of the paper is to demonstrate that these operator algebras encode ( most of ) the dynamical system .",
    "the strongest possible information that might be recovered from an operator algebra of the form we propose would be to obtain the system up to conjugacy and permutation of the maps , since there is no intrinsic order on the generators .",
    "it turns out that what naturally occurs is a local conjugacy , in which the permutation may change from one place to another .",
    "this leads us to the notion that we call _ piecewise conjugacy_. we will show that either of our universal operator algebras contains enough information to recover the dynamical system up to piecewise conjugacy .",
    "these results offer new insights into the classification theory for operator algebras . in @xcite ,",
    "muhly and solel initiated an ambitious program of classifying all tensor algebras of c*-correspondences up to isomorphism .",
    "they introduced a notion of aperiodicity for c*-correspondences , and were able to classify up to isometric isomorphism all tensor algebras associated with aperiodic correspondences .",
    "many important operator algebras , including various natural subalgebras of the cuntz algebras , were left out of their remarkable classification scheme . a first effort to address the periodic case was the study of isomorphisms between graph algebras @xcite .",
    "the classification results of this paper for tensor algebras of multidimensional systems includes many examples which are not aperiodic , and also pushes the envelope beyond isometric isomorphisms .",
    "the complexity of the arguments involved in our setting , as well as the need for importing non - trivial results from other fields of mathematics , seem to indicate that a comprehensive treatment of the periodic case for arbitrary tensor algebras of c*-correspondences may not be feasible at this time .    as a first step in understanding our operator algebras for multi - variable dynamical systems ,",
    "we produce concrete models by way of dilation theory . in recent work , dritschel and mccullough",
    "@xcite show that",
    "the _ maximal representations _ of an operator algebra @xmath17 are precisely those which extend ( uniquely ) to a @xmath18-representation of the c*-envelope , @xmath19 .",
    "they use this to provide a new proof of the existence of the c*-envelope independent of hamana s theory @xcite of injective envelopes .",
    "when such representations are irreducible , they are called boundary representations .",
    "this key notion was introduced by arveson in his seminal work @xcite on dilation theory for operator algebras ( which are generally neither abelian nor self - adjoint ) .",
    "very recently , arveson @xcite has shown that there are always sufficiently many boundary representations to determine @xmath19 .",
    "the dilation theory is both more straightforward and more satisfying in the case of the tensor algebra .",
    "one can explicitly exhibit a natural and tractable family of boundary representations which yield a completely isometric representation of the operator algebra .",
    "this provides the first view of the c*-envelope .",
    "it also turns out that the tensor algebra is a c*-correspondence in the sense of muhly and solel @xcite .",
    "this enables us to exploit their work , and work of katsura @xcite and katsoulis ",
    "kribs @xcite , in order to describe the c*-envelope of the tensor algebra as a cuntz  pimsner algebra .    in the semicrossed product situation",
    ", one needs to work harder to achieve what we call a _ full dilation_. these are the maximal dilations in this context .",
    "this allows us to show that generally these algebras are not c*-correspondences .",
    "we have no ` nice ' class of representations which yield a completely isometric representation .",
    "so the explicit form of the c*-envelope remains somewhat obscure in this case .",
    "nevertheless , the information gained from the dilation theory for the semicrossed product plays an important role in the sequel . indeed , in example [ ex : pwc but not iso ] we use finiteness for the @xmath20-envelope to show that the classification scheme for tensor algebras ( see below ) is not applicable in the semicrossed product situation .",
    "we then turn to the problem of recovering the dynamics from the operator algebra . as a first step",
    ", we establish that algebraic isomorphisms between two algebras of this type are automatically continuous .",
    "then we apply the techniques from our analysis @xcite of the one - variable case to study the space of characters and the two - dimensional nest representations .",
    "these spaces carry a natural analytic structure which is critical to the analysis .",
    "the fact that we are working in several variables means that we need to rely on some well - understood but non - trivial facts about analytic varieties in @xmath21 in order to compare multiplicities of maps in two isomorphic algebras .",
    "the conclusion is that we recover the dynamics up to piecewise conjugacy .    for the converse ,",
    "we would like to show that piecewise conjugacy implies isomorphism of the algebras .    for the tensor algebra",
    "we show that the converse holds for any type of isomorphism provided that either @xmath22 or the covering dimension of @xmath0 is at most 1 .",
    "we conjecture that this holds in complete generality .",
    "this conjecture is backed up by the analysis of the @xmath23 case , in which we require non - trivial topological information about the lie group @xmath24 .",
    "the conjectured converse reduces to a question about the unitary group @xmath25 . while the topology of @xmath26 and @xmath25 gets increasing complicated for @xmath27 , there is reason to hope that there is a positive answer in full generality .    on the other hand , little",
    "is known about the converse for semicrossed products . in example",
    "[ ex : pwc but not iso ] we show that unlike the tensor algebra situation , there are multisystems on totally a disconnected space which are piecewise conjugate and yet their semicrossed products are not completely isometrically isomorphic .",
    "we do not know however whether this failure can occur at the algebraic isomorphism level .    in chapter [ c : semisimple ]",
    ", we consider another connection between the operator algebra and the dynamical system .",
    "we characterize when the operator algebra , either the tensor algebra or the crossed product , is semisimple strictly in terms of the dynamics . in the case of a single map ,",
    "the radical of the semicrossed product has been studied @xcite and finally was completely characterized by donsig , katavolos and manoussos @xcite using a generalized notion of recurrence . here",
    "we introduce a notion of recurrence and wandering sets for a dynamical system which is appropriate for a non - commutative multivariable setting such as ours .",
    "the main result of this chapter is the characterization of semisimplicity in these terms .    finally in the last chapter of this paper we mention some open problems and further direction for future research .",
    "there is a long history of associating operator algebras to dynamical systems , going back to the work of von neumann in the 1930 s . in the self - adjoint context ,",
    "one is dealing with a ( generally amenable ) group of homeomorphisms .",
    "the abstract notion of a crossed product of a c*-algebra by an automorphism ( or group of automorphisms ) is an important general construction .",
    "there is a rich history of associating c*-invariants with the associated dynamical systems .",
    "the use of a nonself - adjoint operator algebras to encode a dynamical system was first introduced by arveson @xcite and arveson ",
    "josephson @xcite for a one - variable system @xmath28 . in their context",
    ", @xmath13 was a single homeomorphism with special properties .",
    "a concrete representation was built from an appropriate invariant measure . with certain additional hypotheses",
    ", they were able to show that the operator algebra provided a complete invariant up to conjugacy .",
    "the abstract version of the _ semicrossed product _ of a dynamical system @xmath28 was introduced by peters @xcite .",
    "he does not require the existence of good invariant measures ; nor does he require @xmath13 to be a homeomorphism . he does require @xmath0 to be compact . with this new algebra , peters was able to show that the semicrossed product is a complete invariant for the system up to conjugacy assuming that @xmath13 has no fixed points .    in @xcite , hadwin and hoover considered a rather general class of conjugacy algebras associated to a single dynamical system .",
    "their proofs work in considerable generality , but the semicrossed product remains the only natural choice for the operator algebra of a system .",
    "their methods allowed a further weakening of the hypotheses .",
    "the set @xmath29 should have no interior , but there is no condition on fixed points . then",
    "again they were able to recover the dynamics , up to conjugacy , from the operator algebra .    in @xcite , we used additional information available from studying the 2-dimensional nest representations of the semicrossed product to completely eliminate the extraneous hypotheses on @xmath28 .",
    "we now know that the semicrossed product , even as an algebra without the norm structure , encodes the system up to conjugacy .",
    "we were also able to replace a compact @xmath0 with a locally compact space and , as a bonus , we were able to classify crossed products of the disc algebra by endomorphisms .",
    "we now discuss the choice of an appropriate covariance algebra for the multivariable dynamical system @xmath28 .",
    "an operator algebra encoding @xmath28 should contain @xmath15 as a c*-subalgebra , and there should be @xmath1 elements @xmath16 satisfying the _ covariance relations _ @xmath30",
    "this relation shows that @xmath31 where we write @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a certain product of the @xmath34 s composed with functions built from the @xmath10 s .",
    "thus the set of polynomials in @xmath35 with coefficients in @xmath15 forms an algebra which we call the _ covariance algebra _ @xmath36 .",
    "the universal algebra should be the ( norm - closed non - selfadjoint ) operator algebra obtained by completing the covariance algebra in an appropriate operator algebra norm .",
    "observe that in the case of compact @xmath0 , @xmath36 is unital , and will contain the elements @xmath16 as generators .",
    "when @xmath0 is not compact , it is generated by @xmath15 and elements of the form @xmath37 for @xmath38 .    by an operator algebra ,",
    "we shall mean an algebra which is completely isometrically isomorphic to a subalgebra of @xmath39 for some hilbert space @xmath40 . by the blecher ",
    "sinclair theorem @xcite , there is an abstract characterization of such algebras .",
    "see @xcite for a thorough treatment of these issues .",
    "our algebras are sufficiently concrete that we will not need to call upon these abstract results",
    ". nevertheless , it seems more elegant to us to define universal operator algebras abstractly rather than in terms of specific representations .    an operator algebra claiming to be _ the _ operator algebra of the system must be universal in some way .",
    "this requires a choice of an appropriate norm condition on the generators .",
    "a few natural choices are :    1 .",
    "* contractive : * @xmath41 for @xmath3 .",
    "* isometric : * @xmath42 for @xmath3 .",
    "* row contractive : * @xmath43 .",
    "* row isometric : * @xmath44 is an isometry ; + i.e. @xmath45 for @xmath46",
    ".    one could add variants such as unitary , co - isometric , column contractive , etc .    in the one variable case ,",
    "all of these choices are equivalent .",
    "indeed , the sz.nagy isometric dilation of a contraction is compatible with extending the representation of @xmath15 .",
    "this leads to the semi - crossed product introduced by peters @xcite .",
    "various non - selfadjoint algebras associated to a dynamical system ( with one map ) have been studied @xcite .",
    "once one goes to several variables , these notions are distinct , even in the case of commutative systems . for example , with three or more commuting variables , examples of varopoulos @xcite and parrott @xcite show that three commuting contractions need not dilate to three commuting isometries .",
    "however a dilation theorem of drury @xcite does show that a strict row contraction of @xmath1 commuting operators dilates to ( a multiple of ) arveson s @xmath47-shift @xcite . while this is not an isometry",
    ", it is the appropriate universal commuting row contraction .    for non - commuting variables , where there is no constraint such as commutativity , one could dilate the @xmath1 contractions to isometries separately .",
    "we shall see that this can be done while extending the representation of @xmath15 to maintain the covariance relations .",
    "also for the row contraction situation , there is the dilation theorem of frahzo  bunce ",
    "popescu @xcite which allows dilation of any row contraction to a row isometry .",
    "again we shall show that this can be done while extending the representation of @xmath15 to preserve the covariance relations .",
    "a locally compact hausdorff space @xmath0 together with @xmath1 proper continuous maps @xmath10 of @xmath0 into itself for @xmath3 will be denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "we shall refer to this as a _ multivariable dynamical system_. it will be called _ metrizable _ if @xmath0 is metrizable .",
    "we now define the two universal operator algebras which we will associate to @xmath28 .",
    "we justify the nomenclature below .    given a multivariable dynamical system @xmath28 ,",
    "define the * tensor algebra * to be the universal operator algebra @xmath48 generated by @xmath15 and generators @xmath35 satisfying the covariance relations @xmath49 and satisfying the row contractive condition @xmath50    similarly , we define the * semicrossed product * to be the universal operator algebra @xmath51 generated by @xmath15 and generators @xmath35 satisfying the covariance relations and satisfying the contractive condition @xmath52 for @xmath3 .",
    "we will not belabour the set theoretic issues in defining a universal object like this , as these issues are familiar . suffice to say that one can fix a single hilbert space of sufficiently large dimension , say @xmath53 , on which we consider representations of @xmath15 and the covariance relations .",
    "then one puts the abstract operator algebra structure on @xmath36 obtained by taking the supremum over all ( row ) contractive representations .",
    "alternatively , one forms the concrete operator algebra by taking a direct sum over all such representations on this fixed space .",
    "a case can be made for preferring the row contraction condition , based on the fact that this algebra is related to other algebras which have been extensively studied in recent years .",
    "if @xmath0 is a countable discrete set , then the row contractive condition yields the graph algebra of the underlying directed graph that forgets which map @xmath10 is responsible for a given edge from @xmath54 to @xmath55 . in the general case",
    ", this turns out to be a c*-correspondence algebra , or tensor algebra , as defined by muhly and solel @xcite .",
    "it is for this reason that we call this algebra the tensor algebra of the dynamical system . as such",
    ", it sits inside a related cuntz ",
    "pimsner c*-algebra @xcite , appropriately defined and studied by katsura @xcite building on an important body of work by muhly and solel beginning with @xcite .",
    "this cuntz - pimsner algebra turns out to be the c*-envelope @xcite of the tensor algebra @xcite .",
    "the c*-envelope of the tensor algebra is therefore always nuclear .",
    "we may consider the dynamical system @xmath28 as an action of the free semigroup @xmath56 .",
    "the free semigroup @xmath56 consists of all words in the alphabet @xmath57 with the empty word @xmath58 as a unit . for each @xmath59 in @xmath56 , let @xmath60 denote the map @xmath61 .",
    "this semigroup of endomorphisms of @xmath0 induces a family of endomorphisms of @xmath15 by @xmath62 .",
    "the map taking @xmath63 to @xmath64 is an antihomomorphism of @xmath56 into @xmath65 ; i.e.  @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "this leads us to consider the contractive condition , which is the same as considering contractive covariant representations of the free semigroup .",
    "hence we call the universal algebra the semi - crossed product @xmath51 of the dynamical system",
    ". it also has good properties .",
    "however we do not find this algebra as tractable as the tensor algebra . indeed ,",
    "several problems that are resolved in the tensor algebra case remain open for the semicrossed product . in particular",
    ", it often occurs ( see proposition  [ imposs ] ) that the c*-envelope of the semicrossed product is not nuclear .    in both cases , the ( row )",
    "contractive condition turns out to be equivalent to the ( row ) isometric condition .",
    "this is the result of dilation theorems to extend ( row ) contractive representations to ( row ) isometric ones .",
    "these are analogues of a variety of well - known dilation theorems .",
    "the tensor algebra case is easier than the semicrossed product , and in addition , there is a nice class of basic representations in this case that determine the universal norm .",
    "indeed we exhiibit sufficiently many boundary representations to explicitly represent the c*-envelope . in the case of the crossed product , one needs to introduce the notion of a _ full isometric dilation _ ; and these turn out to yield the maximal representations of the c*-envelope .",
    "we first consider a useful family of representations for the tensor algebra analogous to those used by peters @xcite to define the semi - crossed product of a one variable system .    by fock space , we mean the hilbert space @xmath68 with orthonormal basis @xmath69 .",
    "this has the standard left regular representation of the free semigroup @xmath56 defined by @xmath70    consider the following _ orbit representations _ of @xmath28 .",
    "fix @xmath54 in @xmath0 .",
    "the orbit of @xmath54 is @xmath71 . to this , we identify a natural representation of @xmath48 .",
    "define a @xmath18-representation @xmath72 of @xmath15 on the fock space @xmath73 by @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath75 send the generators @xmath16 to @xmath76 , and let @xmath77 .",
    "then @xmath78 is easily seen to be a covariant representation .",
    "define the _ full fock representation _ to be the ( generally non - separable ) representation @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 on @xmath82 .",
    "we will show that the norm closed algebra generated by @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath3 is completely isometric to the tensor algebra @xmath48 .",
    "when @xmath0 is separable , a direct sum over a countable dense subset of @xmath0 will yield a completely isometric copy on a separable space .",
    "now we turn to the dilation theorem , which is straight - forward given our current knowledge of dilation theory .",

    "we will look for an element of the form @xmath1158 where @xmath1159 . the goal will be to show that @xmath1160 is not quasinilpotent , so contradicting the fact that @xmath374 is in the radical .",
    "when @xmath483 , @xmath374 has only one term and the coefficients in @xmath1160 and all of its powers are non - negative functions .",
    "here there is no cancellation of terms , so the size of a single term in the product @xmath1161 yields a useful lower bound for the norm .",
    "however when @xmath1162 , this is not the case .",
    "instead , we can arrange to choose the words @xmath1163 so that the distinct terms in a product @xmath1161 will be distinct words in @xmath56 .",
    "this will be accomplished if the word @xmath1163 begins with the sequence @xmath1164 , the sequence consisting of @xmath193 1s separating two 2s . for such @xmath1163 ,",
    "consider the terms in a product @xmath1161 .",
    "they will have the form @xmath1165 where @xmath199 is a product of @xmath1166 words @xmath1167 .",
    "the first few letters of @xmath199 will be @xmath1168 , uniquely identifying @xmath1169 and @xmath1170 will be the first @xmath1171 terms of @xmath199 .",
    "peel that term off and repeat . since the product determines the terms , in order , it follows that distinct products yield distinct words .",
    "so again , there is no cancellation of terms .",
    "therefore the size of a single term in the product will yield a lower bound for the norm of @xmath1160 .",
    "the plan of attack is to show that @xmath1172 where @xmath1173 and @xmath1174 . in computing the next power",
    ", we see that @xmath1175 provided that @xmath1176 for all @xmath544 , we obtain that @xmath1177    the preceding calculation indicates where we should look .",
    "one has formulae @xmath1178 and @xmath1163 begins with @xmath1179 for @xmath1180 . we choose @xmath1181 so that @xmath1182 to start the induction .",
    "we also have functions @xmath1183 and @xmath1184 we need to ensure that @xmath1176 for all @xmath544 .    to this end ,",
    "let @xmath1185 .",
    "our task will be accomplished if we can find non - empty open sets @xmath1186 for @xmath544 so that @xmath1187    indeed , if we have these inclusions , we can show by induction that @xmath1188 on @xmath1189 .",
    "clearly this is the case for @xmath1190 . assuming the properties outlined in the previous paragraph , @xmath1191 and thus @xmath1192 on @xmath1193",
    "similarly , @xmath1194 , and so @xmath1195 on @xmath1193 .",
    "finally @xmath1188 on @xmath1196",
    ". therefore the product yields @xmath1197 on @xmath1193 .    to construct @xmath1193 , observe that there are no @xmath1198-wandering sets . in particular",
    ", there is a @xmath1199 so that @xmath1200 with this choice ( and recalling that @xmath1201 ) , we have that @xmath1202",
    "lastly , @xmath1203 this completes the induction .",
    "we see that the radical must be @xmath379 , and so @xmath17 is semisimple .",
    "the equivalence of ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) in the metric case is given by corollary  [ c : metric_wander ] .",
    "the major goal of associating an operator algebra to a dynamical system is to provide another venue for seeking invariants for these systems . in the case of a (",
    "amenable ) group of homeomorphisms , there have been a number of successes using c*-algebra crossed products .",
    "systems which are not invertible , such as those considered here , appear to be better suited to nonself - adjoint operator algebras .",
    "the major open problem arising from this paper , as elaborated in conjectures [ conj : iso ] and [ conj : simplex ] , is whether the isomorphism class of the tensor algebra of a multivariable dynamical systems is a complete invariant for the system up to piecewise conjugacy .",
    "this is valid for low dimensional topological spaces , and when the multisystem consists of no more than three maps ; and here isomorphism and completely isometric isomorphism coincide .",
    "this offers strong evidence for a positive answer .    on the other hand ,",
    "the classification problem for semicrossed products is wide open .",
    "we have no plausible conjecture here .",
    "example [ ex : pwc but not iso ] shows that completely isometric isomorphism of the semicrossed products can be strictly stronger than piecewise conjugacy .",
    "we suspect that , in that example , the algebras are not even algebraically isomorphic .",
    "so what does the isomorphism class of the semicrossed product capture ?",
    "our classification tool , the two dimensional nest representations , do not seem to differentiate , in a qualitative way , between the tensor algebra and the semicrossed product .",
    "we have no way of extracting from them the additional information needed for the classification of the semicrossed products",
    ". perhaps a study of higher dimensional nest representations , as it was done in @xcite for graph algebras , will yield additional structural information about these operator algebras .    in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the fundamental relation for strongly maximal taf algebras can be recovered from the ( perhaps infinite dimensional ) representation theory of such algebras . since various taf algebras ( as well as our tensor algebras ) are actually tensor algebras of correspondences , we expect that the completion of the classification scheme of muhly and solel @xcite mentioned in the introduction will profit from a better understanding of their nest representations .    also in the case of taf subalgebras of af c*-algebras , power @xcite was partially successful in using homology theory to extract invariants",
    ". there may be a role here for some homology groups to capture topological information .",
    "we briefly consider some other aspects of the relationship between the dynamics and the operator algebras . in chapter",
    "[ c : semisimple ] , we clarified the connection between the semisimplicity of the operator algebra and the ( non - existence of ) generalized wandering sets .",
    "this naturally begs the question of a topological description of the jacobson radical in terms of the underlying dynamics . in the case of a single map , or even a finitely generated family of commuting maps ,",
    "this was done in @xcite .",
    "likely , as in their work , a refinement of the notion of recurrence will play a role .",
    "one can also consider other topological conditions such as chaos , and try to capture this in the operator algebra context . in the case of a single map @xmath13",
    ", one can observe the following phenonena .",
    "a periodic point leads to a finite dimensional _ maximal _ orbit representation .",
    "so a dense set of periodic points means that the c*-envelope has a faithful representation which is the direct sum of irreducible finite dimensional representations .",
    "in particular , it is quasidiagonal .",
    "what does quasidiagonality of this c*-algebra mean in general ?",
    "also a transitive point yields a faithful irreducible maximal representation ; that is , the c*-envelope is primitive .",
    "do these two properties together imply that the system is chaotic ?",
    "is there an analogue for multivariable systems ?    a third aspect that we wish to mention is consideration of relations among the maps @xmath10 .",
    "it is possible to encode certain types of relations and create a universal operator algebra .",
    "such relations will be considered in a forthcoming paper .",
    "these relations have the effect of restricting the possible characters to lie on an analytic variety in @xmath21 .",
    "so it is anticipated that further connections to several complex variables or algebraic geometry will be required .",
    "one is also tempted to consider local relations , such as maps commuting when the domain lies in a certain open subset .",
    "a much more elusive quest is whether one can construct , in a natural way , an operator algebra that automatically encodes any such relationships that exist .",
