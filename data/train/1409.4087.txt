    "this is most likely due to inhomogeneous broadening .",

    "first , in figure  [ figure3]a we verify that the transition does not originate from a combination of microwave leakage and stray dc fields .",
    "although we carefully zero dc electric fields , a stray dc electric field in the atom - field interaction volume could , in principle , weakly perturb the @xmath25 and @xmath23 levels by adding some @xmath26-admixture to these levels .",
    "any microwave - radiation leakage into the atom - field interaction region under the simultaneous presence of a dc electric field would drive the transition as an electric - dipole transition between the weakly - perturbed @xmath25 and @xmath23 levels . in order to verify that our spectral line is not due to such a coincidence",
    ", we look for a spectral line while leaving all microwave equipment fully powered but blocking the weak , intensity - modulated optical beam in the mach - zehnder interferometer ( beam block ` b1 ' in figure  [ figure1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", the atoms are still trapped via the high - power , unmodulated beam .",
    "a stray dc electric field and leakage of microwave radiation into the chamber would drive the transition in a single step , as described . in figure  [ figure3]a",
    ", we scan the microwave frequency in a manner identical with the procedure used for figure  [ figure2]a .",
    "no spectral line is evident in figure  [ figure3]a .",
    "this establishes that lattice light modulation , rather than microwave leakage in the presence of a stray dc electric field , drives the observed transition .",
    "next , we aim to distinguish between the possible @xmath8 and @xmath9 transition mechanisms in equation  . as detailed in the next paragraph , either mechanism may , in principle , drive the observed @xmath2 transition via lattice modulation .",
    "however , these fundamentally distinct mechanisms differ in ways that can be tested experimentally .",
    "the modulated light field contains the frequency @xmath18 and frequency sidebands @xmath27 , where @xmath18 is the light frequency , and @xmath28 is the microwave modulation frequency of the light intensity ( which is resonant with the @xmath2 transition ) .",
    "the presence of multiple frequencies allows , in principle , for the @xmath8 term to couple @xmath25 to @xmath23 in a two - step ( second - order ) process via a stimulated raman transition through one or more states that have an energy separation @xmath29 from the @xmath25 and @xmath23 levels .",
    "following dipole selection rules , this mechanism would involve optical @xmath30 and @xmath31 electric - dipole transitions through distant intermediate @xmath26-states .",
    "the raman coupling mechanism would be effective in both running - wave or standing - wave laser fields .",
    "on the other hand , the coupling due to the @xmath9 term is proportional to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the light intensity ( figure  [ figure1 ] ) . for this coupling to be effective in first order",
    ", two conditions must be simultaneously fulfilled : the light intensity must substantially vary as a function of position @xmath34 within the volume of the atom , and the modulation frequency @xmath28 must correspond to the energy - level difference . without spatial variation of @xmath33 , the coupling vanishes due to the orthogonality of the atomic states .",
    "hence , the @xmath9 coupling can be turned on or off by providing an intensity - modulated standing wave or a running wave , respectively ( where the running - wave beam may or may not be intensity - modulated in time ) .    to test this , in figure  [",
    "figure3]b we exchange the intensity - modulated standing - wave optical lattice for an intensity - modulated running - wave beam by blocking the retro - reflected lattice beam with beam block ` b2 ' in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "we then scan the microwave frequency in a manner identical with the procedure used for figure  [ figure2]a .",
    "no spectral line is evident in figure  [ figure3]b .",
    "therefore , the transition mechanism responsible for the spectral line observed in figure  [ figure2]a is indeed a single - step atom - field interaction arising from the modulated optical standing - wave intensity ( via a first - order @xmath9 interaction ) , not a two - step electric - dipole raman coupling process arising from the frequency sidebands in the light field ( via a second - order @xmath8 interaction ) .",
    "spectral line on interaction time @xmath35 with the modulated lattice . * a - c * , for each @xmath35 , the fraction of atoms in @xmath23 is recorded while scanning the microwave modulation frequency .",
    "the data are averages of 8 scans with 200 measurements each .",
    "error bar , s.e.m . of the 8 scans . the data for @xmath36  3 ( 6 and 9 )  @xmath37s are fit with double- ( triple- ) peak gaussians ( red solid curves ) .",
    "the fwhm ( gray areas ) of the dominant gaussians ( red dashed curves ) decrease with increasing @xmath35 , and the heights increase.**,width=336 ]    [ [ section-3 ] ]      here we characterize the dependence of ponderomotive spectroscopy on several experimental parameters . in figure  [ figure4 ]",
    "we show the scaling behaviour of the spectral line width and amplitude on the atom - field interaction time .",
    "experimentally , the interaction time @xmath35 is defined as the time between when the atoms are excited to the @xmath25 state and when the atoms are ionized for detection ( methods ) , typically @xmath38s . during the atom - field interaction time , the transitions are driven by the intensity - modulated lattice ( which is always on ) , and the atoms undergo a square - pulse coupling to state @xmath23 of duration @xmath35 . in the limit of weak saturation and assuming a fourier - limited spectral profile of the driving field , the full - width - at - half maximum ( fwhm ) of the spectral line is expected to decrease with increased interaction time as @xmath39 .",
    "this agrees with the trend observed in figure  [ figure4 ] .",
    "a double - gaussian fit of the 3  @xmath37s spectral line and triple - gaussian fits of the 6-and-9-@xmath37s spectral lines ( red solid curves in figure  [ figure4 ] ) indicate that the fwhm of the dominant gaussian components in each line ( red dashed curves ) are within 20% of the fourier limit .    examining the spectral lines in figure  [ figure4 ] further , we also find that the maximum signal height approximately doubles between 3  and  6  @xmath37s ; the additional increase between 6  and  9  @xmath37s is relatively minor .",
    "this observation is consistent with a rabi frequency within the range of 50 - 100  khz .",

    "[ figure5]a we investigate the dependence of spectral - line height on modulation strength , which is controlled by varying the amplitude of the microwave voltage signal @xmath13 that drives the fibre modulator .",
    "as can be seen in equation  , the rabi frequency @xmath42 has a first - order bessel function ( @xmath43 ) dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "because the height of the spectral line indicates the peak fraction of population in @xmath23 , we expect the height to scale as @xmath44 , for fixed @xmath35 and in the limit of weak saturation . in figure",
    "[ figure5]a , we plot the spectral line height as a function of the bessel function argument , @xmath45 , as we vary @xmath13 .",
    "a @xmath46 fit to the data yields good agreement .",
    "the spectral - line height also depends on the distance of the retro - reflector from the atoms .",
    "both the incident and the retro - reflected intensity - modulated lattice beams can be viewed as periodic sequences of pulses with a repetition frequency @xmath28 .",
    "the spectral - line height is maximal if the pulse trains of the incident and retro - reflected lattice beams arrive synchronously at the atoms location . considering the time delay between the",
    "retro - reflected and incident pulses , it is seen that the spectral - line height should sinusoidally vary with the position of the retro - reflector mirror with a period of 4  mm . in figure",
    "[ figure5]b we plot the spectral - line height as a function of retro - reflector displacement over a range of a few millimetres .",
    "a sinusoidal curve with a period of 4  mm has also been plotted for reference .",
    "we observe good qualitative agreement , with deviations attributed to alignment drift of the excitation beams during acquisition of multiple data scans .",
    "this test provides another verification of our interpretation of the transition mechanism .    in conclusion",
    ", we have successfully demonstrated ponderomotive spectroscopy for the first time .",
    "we have demonstrated major advantages over standard spectroscopy , including improved spatial addressability and flexible transition rules , which are relevant in a broad range of applications . using a temporally- and spatially - modulated ponderomotive interaction , we have driven an atomic microwave transition forbidden by established electric - dipole selection rules , with a spatial resolution in the micrometre range . in our specific case , we have demonstrated ponderomotive spectroscopy using cold rydberg atoms and an intensity - modulated standing - wave laser beam .",
    "one immediate application of this demonstration is in quantum computing@xcite@xmath0@xcite , where single - site addressability plays a central role .",
    "another application is in precision measurement of atomic characteristics@xcite and physical constants ( e.g. the rydberg constant@xcite , leading to the proton size@xcite ) ; there , flexible spectroscopic transition rules will be very convenient . in the future , one",

    "both mot magnetic field and lattice light remain on throughout a data scan , while the mot light is turned off during rydberg atom excitation and probing .",

    "the modulator has an input optical power limit of 200  mw , which is , in the present experiment , insufficient for rydberg - atom trapping . in a mach - zehnder - type interferometric set - up",
    ", we split the 1064-nm laser into a high - power ( 3.9  w ) , unmodulated beam and a low - power ( 190  mw ) , intensity - modulated beam , which is passed through the fibre modulator .",
    "the two beams are coherently re - combined at the exit beam - splitter of the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the re - combined beam incident at the mot region has approximately 1-w of average power , which is sufficient for rydberg atom trapping .",

    "the fibre modulator has two voltage inputs , one for the microwave voltage signal and another for a dc bias voltage .",

    "is set to @xmath52 , which yields maximal intensity modulation when the dc bias voltage is set for a time - averaged transmission through the modulator that equals 50% of the maximum possible .",
