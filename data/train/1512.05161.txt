    "<S> dynamics of the sub - ohmic spin - boson model is investigated by employing a multitude of the davydov @xmath0 trial states , also known as the multi-@xmath0 _ ansatz_. accuracy in dynamics simulations is improved significantly over the single @xmath0 _ ansatz _ , especially in the weak system - bath coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of the multi-@xmath0 _ ansatz _ for various coupling strengths and initial conditions are also systematically examined , with results compared closely with those of the hierarchy equations of motion and the path integral monte carlo approaches . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a coherent - incoherent phase crossover in the nonequilibrium dynamics is studied through the multi-@xmath0 _ ansatz_. the phase diagram is obtained with a critical point @xmath1 . for @xmath2 , the coherent - to - incoherent crossover occurs at a certain coupling strength , while the coherent state recurs at a much larger coupling strength . for @xmath3 , only the coherent phase exists . </S>"
