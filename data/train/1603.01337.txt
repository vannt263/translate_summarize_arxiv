    "direct comparison of data - model _ differences _ to statistical errors over the largest possible  interval is essential .",
    "the  dependence of a popular monte carlo model in ratio with 13 tev spectrum data is consistent with a fixed hard component that differs substantially from data ( larger jet fragment contribution peaking at lower ) .",
    "the issue of model uniqueness is explored by direct comparison with a popular `` power - law '' or `` tsallis - statistics '' monolithic spectrum model similar to the soft - component lvy distribution incorporated in the tcm .",
    "data - model deviations for the power - law model are many tens of statistical error bars over a large  interval and the tcm is definitively favored in that case .",
