    "<S> this article resolves several long - standing conjectures about artin groups of euclidean type . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we prove that every irreducible euclidean artin group is a torsion - free centerless group with a decidable word problem and a finite - dimensional classifying space . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by showing that each of these groups is isomorphic to a subgroup of a group with an infinite - type garside structure . </S>",
    "<S> the garside groups involved are introduced here for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> they are constructed by applying semi - standard procedures to crystallographic groups that contain euclidean coxeter groups but which need not be generated by the reflections they contain .        </S>",
    "<S> arbitrary coxeter groups are groups defined by a particularly simple type of presentation , but the central motivating examples that lead to the general theory are the irreducible groups generated by reflections that act geometrically ( i.e. properly discontinuously and cocompactly by isometries ) on spheres and euclidean spaces . </S>",
    "<S> presentations for these spherical and euclidean coxeter groups are encoded in the well - known dynkin diagrams and extended dynkin diagrams , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> arbitrary artin groups are groups defined by a modified version of these simple presentations , a definition designed to describe the fundamental group of a space constructed from the complement of the hyperplanes in a complexified version of the reflection arrangement for the corresponding coxeter group .    the spherical artin groups , i.e. the artin groups corresponding to coxeter groups that act geometrically on spheres , have been well understood ever since artin groups themselves were introduced in 1972 by pierre deligne @xcite and by egbert brieskorn and kyoji saito @xcite in adjacent articles in the _ </S>",
    "<S> inventiones_. given the centrality of euclidean coxeter groups in coxeter theory and lie theory more generally , it has been somewhat surprising that the structure of most euclidean artin groups has remained mysterious for the past forty plus years .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we clarify the structure of all euclidean artin groups by showing that they are isomorphic to subgroups of a new class of garside groups that we believe to be of independent interest . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically we prove four main results . </S>",
    "<S> the first establishes the existence of a new class of garside groups based on intervals in crystallographic groups closely related to the irreducible euclidean coxeter groups .    </S>",
    "<S> [ main : garside ] let @xmath0 be an irreducible euclidean coxeter group and let @xmath1 be its set of reflections . for each coxeter element </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 there exists a set of translations @xmath3 and a crystallographic group @xmath4 containing @xmath5 with generating set @xmath6 so that the weighted factorizations of @xmath7 over this expanded generating set form a balanced lattice . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> this collection of factorizations define a group @xmath8 with a garside structure of infinite - type .    </S>",
    "<S> the second shows that these crystallographic garside groups contain subgroups that we call dual euclidean artin groups .    </S>",
    "<S> [ main : subgroup ] for each irreducible euclidean coxeter group @xmath9 and for each choice of coxeter element @xmath7 , the garside group @xmath8 is an amalgamated free product of explicit groups with the dual artin group @xmath10 as one of its factors . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the dual artin group @xmath10 injects into the garside group @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> the third shows that this dual euclidean artin group is isomorphic to the corresponding artin group .    </S>",
    "<S> [ main : isomorphic ] for each irreducible euclidean coxeter group @xmath0 and for each choice of coxeter element @xmath7 as the product of the standard coxeter generating set @xmath11 , the artin group @xmath12 and the dual artin group @xmath13 are naturally isomorphic .    and </S>",
    "<S> finally , our fourth main result uses the garside structure of the crystallographic garside supergroup to derive structural consequences for its euclidean artin subgroup .    </S>",
    "<S> [ main : artin ] every irreducible euclidean artin group @xmath14 is a torsion - free centerless group with a solvable word problem and a finite - dimensional classifying space .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15    the relations among these groups are shown in figure  [ fig : maps ] . </S>",
    "<S> the notations in the middle column refer to the coxeter group and the artin group as defined by their dual presentations . </S>",
    "<S> these dual presentations facilitate the connection between the coxeter group @xmath9 and the crystallographic group @xmath4 and between the artin group @xmath14 and the crystallographic garside group @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> theorem  [ main : artin ] represents a significant advance over what was previous known . in 1987 , craig squier analyzed the euclidean artin groups with three generators : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> his main technique was to analyze the presentations as amalgamated products and hnn extensions of known groups , a technique that does not appear to generalize to the remaining groups . </S>",
    "<S> the ones of type @xmath19 have been understood via a semi - classical embedding @xmath20 into a type @xmath21 spherical artin group @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more recently franois digne used dual garside structures to successfully analyze the euclidean artin groups of types @xmath19 and @xmath22 @xcite . this article is the third in a series which continues the investigation along these lines . </S>",
    "<S> the first two papers are @xcite and @xcite and there also is a survey article @xcite that discusses the results in all three papers . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of @xcite was a negative one : types @xmath19 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the only euclidean types whose dual presentations are garside . </S>",
    "<S> the results in this article show how to overcome the deficiencies that arise in types @xmath21 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> * overview : * the article is divided into four parts . </S>",
    "<S> part i contains basic background definitions for posets , coxeter groups , intervals and garside structures . </S>",
    "<S> part ii introduces an interesting discrete group generated by coordinate permutations and translations by integer vectors whose structure is closely related by the coxeter and artin groups of type @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> these `` middle groups '' and the structure of their intervals play a major role in the proofs of the main results . </S>",
    "<S> part iii shifts attention to intervals in arbitrary irreducible euclidean coxeter groups and introduces various new groups including the crystallographic groups and crystallographic garside groups mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> part iv contains the proofs of our four main results .    </S>",
    "<S> [ part : background ] this part contains background material with one section focusing on posets and coxeter groups , another on intervals and garside structures . </S>"
