    "this talk is partly based on published papers  @xcite on the lightest scalars including a few new comments , and partly on some work under progress .",
    "first i shall discuss the evidence for the light  and discuss shortly the linear sigma model , and explain how one can understand the controversial light scalar mesons with a unitarized quark model , which includes most well established theoretical constraints : _",
    "( i ) _ zeroes as required by chiral symmetry , _ ( ii ) _ all light two - pseudoscalar ( pp ) thresholds with flavor symmetric couplings in a coupled channel framework _ ( iii ) _ physically acceptable analyticity , and _",
    "( iv ) _ unitarity .",
    "a unique feature of such a model is that it simultaneously describes a whole scalar nonet and one obtains a good representation of a large set of relevant data , with a few parameters , which all have a clear physical interpretation .",
    "also consistency with unitarity can require that when the effective coupling becomes large enough one can have twice as many poles in the output spectrum , than the @xmath9-like poles one puts in as born terms .",
    "the new poles can then be interpreted as being mainly meson - meson bound states , but strongly mixed with @xmath0 states .",
    "then i discuss the recently measured @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays , where the , respectively @xmath12 , is clearly seen as the dominant peak , and point out that these decays rates can be understood in a rather general model for the weak matrix elements .",
    "this indicates that the broad ( 600 ) and the @xmath12 belong to the same multiplet .",
    "finally the experimental fact that there seems to be too many light scalar mesons , presumably two nonets , one in the 1 gev region ( a meson - meson nonet ) and another one near 1.5 gev ( a @xmath0 nonet ) , requires a new effective model for the light scalar spectrum .",
    "i argue that two coupled linear sigma models may provide a first step for an understanding of such a proliferation of 18 light scalar states . after gauging the overall symmetry one",
    "could then look at the lightest scalars as higgs - like bosons for the nonperturbative low energy strong interactions .",
    "the interpretation of the nature of lightest scalar mesons has been controversial for long .",
    "there is no general agreement on where are the @xmath0 states , is there a glueball among the light scalars , are some of the too numerous scalars multiquark , @xmath13 or other meson - meson bound states ?",
    "these are fundamental questions of great importance in particle physics . the mesons with vacuum quantum numbers",
    "are known to be crucial for a full understanding of the symmetry breaking mechanisms in qcd , and presumably also for confinement .    as for the light and broad @xmath3 near 600 mev , all authors do not even agree on its existence as a fundamental hadron , although the number of supporters is growing rapidly .",

    "1 * - the pole positions of the @xmath3 resonance , as listed by the pdg ( year 2000 ) under @xmath14 or @xmath3 ( filled circles ) , plotted in the complex energy plane ( in units of mev ) .",
    "the triangles represent the mass and width parameters ( plotted as @xmath15 ) , which were reported at a kyoto meeting in june 2000 .",
    "i could not here distinguish between pole and breit - wigner parameters .",
    "the star is the @xmath15 point obtained from the recent e791 experiment on @xmath16 ( @xmath17 mev , @xmath18 mev ) while the open circle is that obtained by cleo for @xmath19 .",
    "a light scalar - isoscalar meson ( the ) , with a mass of twice the constituent @xmath20 quark mass , or @xmath21 mev , coupling strongly to @xmath22 is of importance in all nambu  jona - lasinio - like ( njl - like ) models for dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry . in these models",
    "the @xmath3 field obtains a vacuum expectation value , i.e. , one has a -like condensate in the vacuum , which is crucial for the understanding of all hadron masses , as it explains in a simple way the difference between the light constituent and chiral quark mass .",
    "then most of the nucleon mass is generated by its coupling to the @xmath3 , which acts like an effective higgs - like boson for the hadron spectrum .    in fig",
    "1 i have plotted with filled circles the results of 22 different analyses on the  pole position , which are included in the 2000 edition of the review of particle physics @xcite under the entry @xmath14 or . most of these find a  pole position near 500-i250 mev .    also , at a recent meeting in kyoto @xcite devoted to the @xmath3 , many groups reported preliminary analyzes , which find the  resonance parameters in the same region .",
    "these are plotted as triangles in fig . 1 . here",
    "it was not possible to distinguish between breit - wigner parameters and pole positions , which of course can differ by several 100 mev for the same data .",
    "it must also be noted that many of the triangles in fig .",
    "1 rely on the same raw data and come from preliminary analyzes not yet published .",
    "i also included in fig .",
    "1 ( with a star ) the  parameters obtained from the recent e791 experiment at fermilab @xcite , where 46% of the @xmath23 dalitz plot is @xmath24 .",
    "the open circle in the same figure represents the  parameters extracted from the cleo analysis of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "there is also a very clear , although still preliminary , signal for a light  ( breit - wigner mass=@xmath26 and width= @xmath27 ) in a bes experiment@xcite on j/@xmath28 .",
    "the njl model is an effective theory which is believed to be related to qcd at low energies , when one has integrated out the gluon fields .",
    "it involves a linear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "after bosonization of the njl model one finds essentially the linear sigma model ( ) as an approximate effective theory for the scalar and pseudoscalar meson sector .",
    "about 30 years ago schechter and ueda @xcite wrote down the @xmath29  for the meson sector involving a scalar and a pseudoscalar nonet .",
    "this ( renormalizable ) theory has only 6 parameters , out of which 5 can be fixed by the pseudoscalar masses and decay constants ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the sixth parameter for the ozi rule violating 4-point coupling must be small .",
    "one can then predict , with no free parameters , the tree level scalar masses @xcite , which turn out to be not far from the lightest experimental masses , although the two quantities ( say lagrangian mass vs. second sheet pole mass ) ) are the same thing , but can differ for the same model and data by well over 100 mev .",
    "the important thing is that the scalar masses are predicted to be near the lightest experimentally seen scalar masses , and not in the 1500 mev region where many authors want to put the lightest @xmath0 scalars . the  is predicted @xcite at 620 mev with a very large width ( @xmath21 mev ) , which well agrees with fig .",
    "the @xmath31 is predicted at 1128 mev , the @xmath12 at 1190 mev , and the @xmath32 or @xmath33 at 1120 mev , which is still surprisingly good considering that loops or unitarity effects must be large as we discuss in the next section .",
    "a few years ago i presented fits to the @xmath34 , @xmath22 s -waves and to the  resonance peak in @xmath35@xcite . in order to understand one of the main points of that work",
    "it is sufficient to look at the partial wave amplitude ( pwa ) in the case of one input resonance , such one i=1/2 ( @xmath36 ) resonance , or one i=1 ( @xmath31 ) resonance .",
    "it can for @xmath37 be written simply as : @xmath38},\\ ] ] where : [ pwa ] im(s)&=&_i im_i(s ) [ impi ] = -_i _ i^2(s - s_a , i)e^-k_i^2/k_0 ^ 2 ( s - s_th , i )  , + re(s)&=&1^_s_th,1 ds  . here the coupling constants @xmath39 are related by flavour symmetry and ozi rule , such that there is only one over all parameter @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 are the positions of the adler zeroes , which are near @xmath42 .",
    "( 1 ) can be looked upon as a more general breit - wigner form , where the mass parameter is replaced by an @xmath43-dependent function ,  the running mass \" @xmath44 .",
    "this @xmath43-dependent mass coming from re@xmath45 is crucial for understanding the scalars . because of",
    "the s - wave thresholds , giving cusps , and the large effective coupling this can not be neglected .    in the flavourless channels the situation is more complicated than in eq .",
    "( 1 ) since one has two @xmath2 states , requiring a two dimensional mass matrix with @xmath43-dependent mass matrix and mass mixing .",
    "note that the sum runs over all light pp thresholds , which means three for the : @xmath46 and three for the : @xmath47 , while for the @xmath48 s there are five channels : @xmath49 .    in figs .",
    "2 and 3 i show the running mass , @xmath50 , and the width - like function , @xmath51 , for the i=1/2 and i=1 channels .",
    "the crossing point of the running mass with @xmath43 gives the @xmath52 mass of the .",
    "the magnitude of the  component in the  is determined by @xmath53 , which is large in the resonance region just below the  threshold .",
    "these functions fix the pwa of eq .",
    "( 1 ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the  was missed because only poles nearest to the physical region were looked for , and the possibility of the resonance doubling phenomenon , discussed below , was overlooked .",
    "only a little later we realized with roos @xcite that two resonances (  and @xmath54 ) can emerge although only one @xmath7 bare state is put in .",
    "then we had to look deeper into the second sheet and found the broad  as the dominant singularity at low mass .",
    "in fact , it was pointed out by morgan and pennington  @xcite that for each  state there are , in general , apart from the nearest pole , also image poles , usually located far from the physical region . as explained in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , some of these can ( for a large enough coupling and sufficiently heavy threshold ) come so close to the physical region that they make new resonances . and , in fact , there are more than four physical poles with different isospin , in the output spectrum of the uqm model , although only four bare states , of _ the same nnonet _ , are put in!. the  and the  of the model thus turn out to be two manifestations of the same state . similarly",
    "the  and the  could be two manifestations of the @xmath55 state .",
    "2 * - the running mass @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the @xmath31 .",
    "the strongly dropping running mass at the @xmath31 position , below the @xmath13 threshold contributes to the narrow shape of the peak .",
    "3 * - the running mass and width - like function @xmath51 for the @xmath33 .",
    "the crossing of @xmath43 with the running mass gives the 90@xmath58 phase shift mass , which roughly corresponds to a naive breit - wigner mass , where the running mass is put constant .",
    "this phenomenon can manifest itself by two crossings with the running mass @xmath59 , one near the threshold and another at higher mass .",
    "then each crossing is related to a different pole .",
    "this happens if the coupling is strong enough and one would generate an extra bound state pole , below the threshold .",
    "( for @xmath60 one is close to that situation , and in the case of @xmath61 a 50% larger coupling physical coupling could bind @xmath34 ) . that bound state pole would then be a true `` 2-meson bound state '' of the two pseudoscalars making up the threshold in question .",
    "the `` binding mechanism '' is then generated by the sum of @xmath43-channel loops required by unitarity .",
    "such binding is of course , in general , related to crossed channel exchanges , which in the uqm are simulated by the form factor .",
    "although the details of any modelling can be critisised , the conclusion remains : _",
    "strong enough couplings can generate new bound states or resonances not present in the input or in the born terms represented by an effective lagrangian_.    only after realizing that this resonance doubling is important the light and broad  was found in the model .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "another important effect that the model can explain is the large mass difference between the @xmath62 and @xmath36 .",
    "because of this large mass splitting many authors argue that the @xmath31 and @xmath12 are not  states , since in addition to being very close to the  threshold , they are much lighter than the first strange scalar , the @xmath33 . naively one expects a mass difference between the strange and nonstrange meson to be of the order of the strange - nonstrange quark mass difference , or a little over 100 mev .    figs . 2 and 3",
    "explain why one can easily understand this large @xmath63 mass splitting as a secondary effect of the large pseudoscalar mass splittings , and because of the large mass shifts coming from the loop diagrams involving the pp thresholds .",
    "if one puts figs . 2 and 53 on top of each other one sees that the 3 thresholds @xmath64 all lie relatively close to the @xmath31 , and all 3 contribute to a large mass shift . on the other hand , for the @xmath33 , the @xmath65 related thresholds ( @xmath66 ) lie far apart from the @xmath36 , while the @xmath67 nearly decouples because of the physical value of the pseudoscalar mixing angle .",
    "this large mass of the @xmath33 is also one of the reasons why several authors want to have a lighter strange meson , the @xmath32 , near 800 mev .",
    "cherry and pennington @xcite have strongly argued against its existence .",
    "but the e791 experiment see some evidence for such a light @xmath32 in @xmath68 . here",
    "the signal is much less evident than the @xmath3 in @xmath69 , but the @xmath32 improves the @xmath70 in the region dominated by the @xmath71 .",
    "one should try a more sophisticated breit - wigner amplitude for the s - wave , as that in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , before one makes more definite statements about the @xmath32 it could be something like a virtual bound @xmath34 state .",
    "the recent experiments studying charm decay to light hadrons are opening up a new experimental window for understanding light meson spectroscopy and especially the controversial scalar mesons , which are copiously produced in these decays .",
    "in particular we refer to the e791 study of the @xmath69 decay @xcite where it is shown how adding an intermediate scalar resonance with floating mass and width in the monte carlo program simulating the dalitz plot densities , allows for an excellent fit to data provided the mass and the width of this scalar resonance are @xmath72 mev and @xmath73 mev .",
    "this resonance is a very good candidate for the @xmath3 . to check this hypothesis we adopt the e791 experimental values for its mass and width and using a constituent",
    "quark meson model ( cqm ) for heavy - light meson decays @xcite we compute the @xmath74 non - leptonic process via _ factorization _",
    "@xcite , taking the coupling of the @xmath3 to the light quarks from the linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "in such a way one is directly assuming that the scalar state needed in the e791 analysis could be the quantum of the @xmath3 field of the linear sigma model .",
    "according to the cqm model and to factorization , the amplitude describing the @xmath74 decay can be written as a product of the semileptonic amplitude @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the axial quark current , and @xmath77 .",
    "the former is parameterized by two form factors , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , connected by the condition @xmath80 , while the latter is governed by the pion decay constant @xmath81 .",
    "as far as the product of the two above mentioned amplitudes is concerned , only the form factor @xmath79 comes into the expression of the @xmath74 amplitude . moreover we need to estimate it at @xmath82 , that is the physically realized kinematical situation .",
    "the cqm offers the possibility to compute this form factor through two quark - meson 1-loop diagrams that we call the _ direct _ and the _ polar _ contributions to @xmath79 .",
    "these quark - meson loops are possible since in the cqm one has effective vertices ( heavy quark)-(heavy meson)-(light quark ) that allow us to _ compute _ spectator - like diagrams in which the external lines represent incoming or outgoing heavy mesons while the internal lines are the constituent light quark and heavy quark propagators .    in figs . 2 and 3 of ref.@xcite",
    "we show respectively the _ direct _ and the _ polar _ diagrams for the semileptonic amplitude @xmath83 , the former being characterized by the axial current directly attached to the constituent quark loop , the latter involving an intermediate @xmath84 or @xmath85 state .",
    "these two diagrams are computed with an analogous technique and one finally obtains a determination of the direct and polar form factors @xmath86 .",
    "the extrapolation to @xmath87 is safe for the direct form factor while is not perfectly under control for the polar form factor since the latter is more reliable at the pole @xmath88 , @xmath89 being the mass of the intermediate state .",
    "we take into account the uncertainty introduced by this extrapolation procedure and signaled by the fact that we find @xmath90 ( computing @xmath91 from the polar diagram with @xmath92 intermediate polar state and @xmath93 from that with intermediate @xmath94 state ) .",
    "our estimate for @xmath95 is in reasonable agreement with an estimate of @xmath96 carried out in @xcite using the e791 data analysis and a breit - wigner like approximation for the    the meson - quark loops are computed substituting the meson vertices with the heavy meson field expressions found by heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) ( since cqm incorporates heavy quark and chiral symmetries ) and the quark lines with the propagators of the heavy and light constituent quarks .",
    "the light constituent mass @xmath97 is fixed by a njl - type gap equation that depends on @xmath97 , and on two cutoffs @xmath98 and @xmath99 in a proper time regularization scheme for the diverging integrals .",
    "the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath98 is fixed by the scale of chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath100 , and we consider @xmath101 gev .",
    "the remaining dependence of @xmath97 on the choice of the infrared cutoff @xmath99 has an expression similar to that of a ferromagnetic order parameter , @xmath102 being different from zero for @xmath99 values smaller than a particular @xmath103 , and zero for higher values .",
    "when @xmath99 ranges from @xmath104 to @xmath105 mev , the value of @xmath97 is almost constant , @xmath106 mev , dropping for higher @xmath99 values .",
    "a reasonable light constituent quark mass is certainly @xmath105 mev and this clearly leaves a @xmath105 mev open window for choosing the infrared cutoff . enforcing the kinematical condition for the meson to decay to its free constituent quarks , which must be possible since the cqm model does not incorporate confinement , requires @xmath107 @xcite",
    ". therefore we pick up the @xmath108 mev value .",
    "the results are quite stable against @xmath109 variations of the uv and ir cutoffs .",
    "the cqm semileptonic @xmath83 transition amplitude is represented by the loop integrals associated to the direct and to the polar contributions .",
    "the result of the integral computations must then be compared with the expression for the hadronic transition element @xmath110 and this allows to extract the desired @xmath111 form factors .",
    "an estimate of the weight of @xmath112 corrections can also be taken into account @xcite .",
    "this computation indicates that the scalar resonance described in the e791 paper can be consistently understood as the @xmath3 of the linear sigma model .",
    "of course a calculation such as the one here described calls for alternative calculations and/or explanations of the e791 data for a valuable and useful comparison of point of views on the @xmath3 nature .",
    "a similar computation@xcite was performed for the related process @xmath113 with the same model .",
    "the agreement with the data indicates that the two resonances the @xmath3 and the @xmath12 belong to a similar flavour multiplet .",
    "as we have seen in the previous discussion there seems to be a proliferation of light scalar mesons .",
    "let us assume@xcite that we have two two light nonets of scalar mesons below about , say 1.7 gev , one of which is the @xmath0 nonet expected from qcd or the quark model , while the other is e.g. meson - meson bound states , but also in a nonet . in order to have a realistic effective model at low energies for the scalars we need an effective chiral quark model , which includes all scalars and pseudoscalars , and where the chiral symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields .",
    "the simplest such chiral quark model is the @xmath114 linear sigma model ( ) .",
    "let us model each scalar multiplet by a . if one has only one scalar multiplet one writes as usual for a gauged ,    ( ) = 1 2 + 1 2 ^2-  + ... [ lag0 ]    here @xmath115 contains 9 scalar and 9 pseudoscalar fields .",
    "( as usual , @xmath115 is a @xmath116 complex matrix , @xmath117 , in which @xmath118 are the gell - mann matrices , normalized as @xmath119= 2\\delta_{ab}$ ] , and where for the singlet @xmath120 ) . if one adds a relatively small term @xmath121 )",
    "^2 $ ] the @xmath31 is split from the @xmath122 .",
    "one can add further terms of higher dimension , and like in sec .",
    "iii an anomaly term det@xmath123det@xmath124 and terms which break the symmetries explicitely , but these are here not important for our qualitative discussion .",
    "thus each meson in eq .",
    "( 2 ) belongs to a flavour nonet . in the quark model",
    "this means it can be a @xmath0 meson .",
    "but , it need not be @xmath0 .",
    "e.g. , meson - meson interactions are well known to be repulsive in exotic channels , but attractive in octet or singlet channels .",
    "therefore , one expects bound meson - meson states only for octets or singlets .",
    "so we can have another set of states @xmath125 , which let us assume , are also described approximately by a similar lagrangian as above , @xmath126 , but with another set of parameters ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "we have thus doubled the spectrum and initially we have two scalar , and two pseudoscalar multiplets , altogether 36 states for three flavours .",
    "then it is natural to introduce a coupling between the two sets of multiplets , which can break the relative symmetry .",
    "the full lagrangian for both @xmath115 and @xmath125 thus becomes , _ tot ( , ) = l()+ ( ) + 4 tr[^+h.c . ]  .",
    "[ lag1 ]    without the @xmath128 term one has for 3 flavours two independent @xmath129 symmetries ( @xmath130 ^ 2 $ ] ) , but the @xmath128 term breaks this down to one exact over - all @xmath129 and one broken relative @xmath129 symmetry . a similar scheme was discussed recently by black et al.@xcite .",
    "now let ( differently from@xcite ) , both @xmath115 and @xmath125 have vacuum expectation values or the @xmath131 symmetry of this potential ( in the case of one flavour ) by two coupled `` mexican hat potentials '' . or , perhaps , better by one mexican hat ( with minimum given by @xmath132 ) coupled to another unstable system , say a vertical elastic bar which can be buckled by a strong enough vertical force , to the side such that the deflection is @xmath133",
    ". then when the hat is hanged on the bar the deflection causes the hat to be tilted through the coupling @xmath128 . ]",
    "@xmath132 and @xmath133 even if @xmath134 ( @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "then the @xmath137 submatrix between two pseudoscalars with same flavour becomes to order @xmath128 : m^2 ( 0 ^ -+)=    (    cc 4v()^2-^2 & -^2 + -^2 & 4v()^2-^2 +    ) = + ^2 (    cc v / v & -1 + -1 & v / v +    )    , which is diagonalized by a rotation @xmath138 ( tan @xmath139 ) , such that the eigenvalues are 0 and @xmath140 : (    cc c & -s + s & c +    ) m^2 ( 0 ^ -+ ) (    cc    c & s + -s & c +    ) = ^2 (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 +    )  .    here @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the approximation is of course valid only if neither @xmath132 nor @xmath133 vanishes .",
    "in fact , one would expect @xmath143 phenomenologically .",

    "on the other hand the scalar masses and mixings are only very little affected if @xmath150 is small .",
    "they are still close to @xmath151 and @xmath152 as in the uncoupled case .",
    "furthermore , denoting ( when @xmath134 ) the axial vector current obtained from @xmath153 by @xmath154 and the one from @xmath155 by @xmath156 , then their sum is exactly conserved ( @xmath157=0 $ ] ) because of the masslessness of @xmath158 , and because of the still exact overall axial symmetry . but",

    ", one must of course get rid of the massless goldstones @xmath162 . by gauging the overall axial symmetry i ( @xmath163 $ ] ) .",
    "i argue that the conventional higgs mechanism absorbs the massless modes @xmath158 from the model , but these degrees of freedom enter instead as longitudinal axial vector mesons and give these mesons mass @xmath164 .",
    "this is similar to the work of bando et al.@xcite on hidden local symmetries .",
    "the main prediction of this scheme is that one must have doubled the light scalar meson spectrum , as seems to be experimentally the case .",
    "of course in order to make any detailed comparison with experiment one must also break the flavour symmetry , and unitarize the model , which is not a simple matter .",
    "the dichotomic role of the pions in conventional models , as being at the same time both the goldstone bosons and the  pseudoscalars , is here resolved in a particularily simple way : one has originally two goldstone - like pions , out of which only one remains in the spectrum , and which is a particular linear combination of the two original pseudoscalar fields .",
    "the two scalar multiplets remain as physical states and one of these ( formed by the @xmath122 and the @xmath165 in the case of two flavours , or the @xmath166 and the @xmath167 in the case of three flavours ) can then be looked upon as the higgs multiplet of strong nonperturbative interactions when a hidden local symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "i have in this talk first pointed out that there is strong evidence ( sec .",
    "ii ) for the existence of the light @xmath122 , and that the linear sigma model ( sec iii ) is not an unreasonable approximation for the lightest nonet .",
    "a more detailed understanding requires a unitarized model ( sec iv ) whereby one can undertand how the masses are shifted , the widths and mixings are distorted , and even why new scalar meson - meson resonances can be created in nonexotic channels .",
    "these effects are important because of the large effective coupling , and because of the nonlinearities due to the s - wave cusps .",
    "the recent observation of @xmath168 and @xmath12 by the e791 experiment on @xmath169 and @xmath170 decays to three pions was discussed in sec .",
    "v , and it was pointed out that these rates can be understood whithin a rather general constituent quark model , with a standard effective lagrangian for the weak matrix elements .    at the end , in sec vi , i discussed some preliminary work@xcite concerning how one could model the the fact that there seems to be groving experimental evidence for two light nonets of scalars , one in the 500 - 1000 gev region ( @xmath171 @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 ) , and another one near 1.3 - 1.7 gev ( @xmath175 @xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath178 ) .",
    "i suggested a linear sigma model as a `` toy model '' for each nonet , each one with its separate vacuum expectation value .",
    "then after coupling these two models through a mixing term and gauging the overall symmetry , one can argue that one of the nonets ( the lighter one ) is a true higgs nonet for strong interactions .",
