    "relativistic jets are thought to characterize the geometry of the most powerful extragalactic sources , blazars and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) . in both classes of sources ,",
    "synchrotron radiation is responsible for the spectrum production over up to ten decades of energy , from radio to soft gamma - rays .",
    "linear polarization , seen in blazars at a level of 1% to 30% @xcite and recently detected also in the optical afterglow of two grbs @xcite , is the most compelling indication of synchrotron radiation .",
    "relativistic beaming enhances the polarized non thermal jet radiation with respect to the unpolarized emission of the host galaxy , resulting in a high net polarization percentage . therefore , short time scale variations of the polarized light trace the dynamics of the plasma inside the jet , and their monitoring yields the most direct insight into the jet physics and powering source",
    ".    studies of linear polarization of blazars have been conducted from radio to uv wavelengths @xcite and optical polarization level has been also adopted as a characteristic feature to select blazar sources @xcite . however , variability of polarization of blazars is poorly investigated , and rapid and intensive monitoring campaigns , even of the brightest and mostly polarized sources , are largely lacking , except for s5  0716 + 714 @xcite .",
    "the bl lac pks  2155304 is a nearby blazar ( z=0.116 , see falomo , pesce & treves 1993 ) , one of the brightest at optical to x - ray frequencies and its polarized optical light has been observed over many years by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main results are a polarization fraction p varying from 2 to 10% , a position angle pa preferentially oriented at about 100 - 120@xmath1 and a wavelength dependence of polarization ( wdp ) tending to be null or slightly increasing toward the blue .",
    "observations of uv polarization with hst by @xcite yielded p=3% and pa=101@xmath1 , and confirmed a positive wdp ( i.e. p decreasing toward longer wavelengths ) through the whole optical - uv range . since in pks  2155304",
    "the synchrotron mechanism is responsible for the spectrum up to hard x - rays , producing a spectral maximum at uv / soft x - rays (  blue blazars \" , see padovani & giommi 1995 , fossati et al .",
    "1998 ) , correlation is expected of flux variations from optical to x - ray wavelengths .",
    "this was observed in past multiwavelength campaigns ( edelson et al .",
    "1995 ; urry et al .",
    "in particular , in may 1994 the polarized optical light variations were faster than those of the total light , and better correlated with the uv variations .",
    "this indicates that optical polarization is an efficient tracer of synchrotron emission , and its variations probe , in the most detailed way , the energy production processes .",
    "to explore variability of the polarization with time scales from months down to less than an hour , we conducted 4 campaigns of polarimetric monitoring of pks  2155304 during 1998 and 1999 at the 2.15  m telescope of the complejo astronomico el leoncito ( casleo , argentina ) .",
    "linear and circular polarization data along with photometric data have been collected simultaneously in bands with a maximum temporal resolution of 15 minutes .",
    "a description of the observations and data reduction process is given in   2 , while   3",
    "is devoted to the presentation of the photometric and polarimetric results . in ",
    "4 we compare our findings with the historical polarization behavior of pks  2155304 , and discuss them in   5 .",
    "preliminary and partial results were presented in @xcite .",
    "the polarimetric data in ubvri bands were gathered during 4 campaigns conducted at the casleo 2.15  m telescope equipped with the photopolarimeter of the turin observatory , for a total of about 47 hours on source exposure time .",
    "a log of all the observations is shown in table  [ linpoltab ] .",
    "the instrument is a double channel chopping photopolarimeter @xcite , based on the design sketched by @xcite .",
    "a half - wave or quarter - wave retarder plate ( for linear or circular polarimetry , respectively ) is inserted in the light beam coming from the telescope .",
    "the plate is rotated through 8 positions by 22.5@xmath1 steps to explore polarization of incoming light .",
    "a subsequent calcite slab splits the light into ordinary and extraordinary rays , with orthogonal polarization planes .",
    "these two rays are alternatively selected by a rotating chopper ; afterwards they pass through a pair of identical diaphragms . in passing through the calcite slab the extraordinary / ordinary component from the sky",
    "is refracted on the ordinary / extraordinary component from the ( object + sky ) .",
    "thus both components from the sky pass both diaphragms and polarization of the sky is eliminated .",
    "finally , the light is split by four dichroic plus bandpass filter combinations and sent to five photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the response of each of the five channels corresponds to one of the bands . in this way , truly multicolor simultaneous photometry and polarimetry is obtained .",
    "it can be noticed that the image is focused on the diaphragm wheel .",
    "so the light beam incident on the retarder plate is converging at an angle of about 3@xmath1 , taking into account the focal ratio of the telescope .",
    "the two light beams ( ordinary and extraordinary ) become then parallel by means of a couple of lenses before reaching the dichroic filters .",
    "an integration time of 10 seconds for each retarder plate position was chosen for all observations , giving a final maximum time resolution of about 3.5  minutes .",
    "however , in order to get an acceptable _ signal to noise _ ratio , the measurements have been binned with 4 or 8 plate cycles bins ( approximately 15 or 30 minutes ) according to the different quality of data in the various nights .",
    "for all the observations a 15@xmath2.8 diameter diaphragm was used .",
    "the determination of the instrumental polarization and orientation of zero point of the retarder with respect to north is performed with the repeated observation of null and high polarization standard stars , respectively . for each campaign ,",
    "the adopted instrumental parameters are the average values obtained from observations of the standard stars during the various nights of that observing run .",
    "the instrumental polarization ranges typically between 0.16% and 0.36% in the u band , and between 0.02% and 0.09% in the other bands .",
    "the position angle corresponding to the zero point is typically 79.8@xmath1 - 82.6@xmath1 with respect to the north .",
    "data analysis is performed by dedicated routines .",
    "they allow calculation of polarization and position angle from the eight integrations made in different orientations of the retarder plate .",
    "error estimates are obtained both from photon statistics and least - squares fit to the eight integrations . the sky background level , measured at the beginning of each set of 4 cycles of full rotations of the retarder ( each cycle being constituted by eight steps of 22.5@xmath1 ) ,",
    "is taken into account interpolating between sky measurements if the observed object ( or the diaphragm ) has not been changed , otherwise the first background value is used .",
    "the averaging procedure uses weights determined from the inverse square of the estimated error for each observation .",
    "the error estimate is taken either from the least - squares fit of the double cosine curves to the eight integrations in the different positions of the retarder or from the photon statistics , whichever is greater .",
    "this prevents weights from having values larger than the theoretical maximum corresponding to photon noise limit , which could happen if only the least - squares fits with only eight data points in each observation were relied upon .",
    "the uncertainties affecting our average measures of instrumental polarization range typically between 0.02% and 0.1% ( the largest values being recorded in u and i bands ) .",
    "these systematic uncertainties affect the measurements of the polarization percentage of the observed source by 0.07% in the u band , 0.04% in b , 0.02% in v , 0.03% in r , and 0.05% ( i ) .",
    "the systematic error on the orientation of the zero position of the retarder , is estimated to be about 0.5@xmath1 , which leads to an uncertainty of about 0.01% in the polarization percentage and about 1@xmath1 in the position angle of pks  2155 - 304 .",
    "we also checked the repeatability of the measurements of p and pa of standard stars from night to night .",
    "the scatter on pa values is less then 1@xmath1 , while the scatter in p is of the order of 0.02% in all bands .",
    "systematic errors are much smaller than statistical errors , and therefore have been ignored in the following .",
    "our reduction routines also account for the depolarization due to the instrumental setup ( telescope + polarimeter ) . to estimate the efficiency of 100% polarized light detection , we used all the observations of highly polarized standards carried out at casleo from 1994 to 1997 .",
    "an average correcting factor 1.03@xmath30.04 was found to be necessary to reproduce the catalogued values in all bands from the measured ones and has been introduced in the reduction routines .    in table",
    "[ linpoltab ] and in fig .  [ plottot ]",
    "we report p and pa averaged over each night , for all campaigns .",
    "uncertainties on the data points given in brackets are the maximum between the statistical error associated with the individual points and the standard deviation within the night , in the specified photometric band . only for the night of 4 august 1999 , due to the poor weather conditions resulting in low _ signal to noise _ ratio ,",
    "all the collected data have been averaged without binning over the plate cycles , resulting in the weighted means and statistical errors that are reported in table  [ linpoltab ] .",
    "similar reduction has been performed also on circular polarimetry data .",
    "the resulting nightly means are reported in table  [ linpoltab ] along with statistical uncertainties .",
    "photometry from casleo observations can be derived , from the same polarimetric data , by adding counts from ordinary and extraordinary rays for each plate position to obtain the total flux from the source , measured in the five bands . in order to correct the source flux for sky transparency or atmospheric extinction variations during the integrations , we observed reference stars 2 and 3 of @xcite many times per night during the runs of june and august 1998 and august 1999 .",
    "however , photometry is much more sensitive than polarimetry to the sky conditions , therefore meaningful magnitude measurements have been obtained only for the clearest nights or intervals .",
    "table  [ fottab ] shows a summary of the results .    to partially overcome the limitation inherent to the casleo photometry , in 25 - 28 august 1998 and 1 - 5 august 1999 we performed additional differential photometry in bands at the 1.54  m telescope located at bosque alegre astrophysical station of the crdoba astronomical observatory ( argentina ) equipped with a photometrics 1024@xmath41025 pixels ccd camera ( multifunctional integral field spectrograph , daz et al .",
    "1997 , daz et al .",
    "the magnitudes of pks  2155 - 304 and of the standard stars labelled as 2 and 3 by @xcite were determined by means of aperture photometry routines in the midas package .",
    "a circle with a diameter of 11@xmath2.4 was used to measure bl lac flux .",
    "the magnitude differences measured between the two standard stars are very close to the standard ones ; this supports the similarity between the instrumental and the standard systems .",
    "hence , standard magnitudes of pks  2155304 were calculated by assuming b=12.73 , v=12.04 , r=11.64 and i=11.28 for the standard star 2 , as reported by @xcite .",
    "nightly means are shown as a summary in table  [ fottab ] .",
    "the linear polarization percentage was roughly at the same average level in all bands in june 1998 and august 1999 , while it was @xmath01.3 - 1.5 times higher in august 1998 ( see table  [ linpoltab ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the polarization angle was around 100 - 120@xmath1 in june 1998 and august 1999 , and at 70@xmath1 in august 1998 ( fig .",
    "[ plottot ] ) .",
    "day - to - day variations generally did not exceed a factor @xmath01.2 in amplitude for p and @xmath020@xmath1 in pa , with the exception of a relevant variability episode on 1998 june 18 : the polarization decreased in all bands ( the largest variation was from 4 to 1.5% in i band ) in no more than 21 hours , and subsequently returned in 22 hours to the value it had before the  dip \" ( fig",
    ".  [ plottot ] , panel a ) .",
    "although a precise determination of the halving and doubling time scales of this variation is hampered by the day - time gap , based on the modest decreasing trend present in all bands during the night of june 17 ( see fig .  [ plotintranight ] panel a ) we estimate that the halving / doubling time scale could be as short as 14 hours . simultaneously , the polarization plane rotated by about 90@xmath1 . following our standard procedure , during june 1998 run we observed several high polarization standard stars , some of them were monitored each night .",
    "their position angles show constant values in all the nights with a maximum deviation of @xmath01@xmath5 .",
    "we are therefore confident that the behaviour of pks  2155304 can not be attributed to a systematic instrumental effect .",
    "a hint of a similar variability episode is contained in august 1999 data , when the polarization decreased from 5.5 to 1.5 % in v band over two days , while no simultaneous rotation of the pa was recorded .",
    "however , due to the poor quality of the sky in these nights , this event should be considered with some caution .",
    "intranight variations of up to a factor @xmath01.3 in p and @xmath07@xmath5 in pa are sometimes detected with time scales of few hours .",
    "these are either random , or they follow the longer time scale trends ( as in the night of 17 june 1998 , where the long time trend is prevailing ) .",
    "data from the three nights in which such variations are more apparent ( one for each campaign ) are plotted for selected bands in fig .",
    "[ plotintranight ] . in the same nights ,",
    "similar behaviors are recorded also in the other bands .",
    "the event recorded during 28 august 1998 ( see fig .  [ plotintranight ] panel b ) is particularly notable for smoothness of the temporal profile .",
    "after a small decrease in polarization in the first 15 minutes to a low state , maintained for about half an hour , in the next 2 hours the source exhibits a regular and rather smooth increase up to 1.2 times the minimum value . during other nights ,",
    "the variations detected over similar time scales are more modest or absent .",
    "we searched for a correlation between polarization and position angle on various time scales . in some nights",
    "there is evidence of such a correlation , while in other cases the variations in p and pa seem little correlated ( fig .",
    "[ ppatot ] ) .",
    "moreover , within the same night , the p - pa correlation may be different in the five photometric bands .",
    "looking at inter - night variations , a correlation can be evidenced only for the dip of 18 june 98 ( fig .",
    "[ plottot ] panel a ) .",
    "finally , looking at the whole data set ( see table  [ linpoltab ] ) , there is suggestion of a correlation between subsequent campaigns , in the sense of increasing p and decreasing pa from june to august 1998 and viceversa from august 1998 to august 1999 .",
    "we also investigated the wavelength dependence of polarization ( wdp ) .",
    "examples from selected nights are in fig .",
    "non - null wdp was found in some nights during the runs of june and august 1998 , in the sense of decreasing polarization with increasing wavelength .",
    "this dependence disappeared in the run of august 1999 , when the polarized spectrum appears flat .",
    "following @xcite , we defined the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 which describe the spectral shape of the polarization percentage and position angle , and determined them by fitting power - laws to the daily averages of the ubvri linear polarization percentages and position angles .",
    "table  [ dlogp ] reports the values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with their standard deviations as resulting from the fit . while in some nights @xmath8",
    "is obtained with more than 2@xmath10 confidence , the fitted @xmath9 values are poorly determined .",
    "the suggestion is that the best determined ones ( 27 and 28 august 1998 ) are negative , namely the pa increases toward the red wavelengths .",
    "results on circular polarization are reported in tab  [ linpoltab ] .",
    "generally , no significant detection is present ; marginally significant ( slightly less than 3@xmath10 ) circular polarization is seen in bands on 1998 november 19 at a level consistent with -0.2% in all filters , within 1@xmath10 .",
    "no clear pattern is deduced from comparison of values in different filters in the other nights , nor is it discerned any preferred value , in a given filter , by comparison among different nights .",
    "conservatively , we set an upper limit of 0.2% at the 3  @xmath10 level for our measurement of circular polarization of pks  2155304 .",
    "the casleo photometry agrees well with the crdoba photometry , as seen in fig .",
    "[ plotintranight1 ] .",
    "variability between successive runs ( on months intervals ) is always present and amounts to some tenths of a magnitude , with no apparent correlation with polarization .",
    "variations within the same night and from night to night in the same run are observed at a level up to @xmath010% , and will be discussed in e. poretti et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "generally , variations of the total and polarized flux are not found to be correlated within the same run . in particular , the sharp decrease of the linear polarization which occurred on 18 june 1998 had no counterpart in the casleo photometry ( see tab  [ fottab ] ) , and the significant decrease of polarization between 1999 august 2 and august 3 corresponds to practically unaltered photometric state , as shown by the casleo and crdoba photometry in table  [ fottab ] .",
    "similarly , no correlation is found on intranight scales . in particular , during the night of 1998 august 28 , no correlated variation in total flux has been recorded simultaneous with the strong variability of polarization percentage in the early portion of the run ( see fig .",
    "[ plotintranight ] , panel b ) . the smooth and broad maximum present in the total light curve in the central part of the night",
    "can not be reliably correlated with the fast variation seen in our polarimetric data .",
    "as mentioned above , pks  2155304 has been the target of various optical polarimetric campaigns in previous years .",
    "we compared our results with those reported in the literature by representing in histograms p and pa values from previous measurements and from our own ( fig .",
    "[ apjlett3 ] ) . both distributions exhibit a broad peak , indicating some historical preferred values .",
    "the peak of polarization percentage occurs at about 5.5% .",
    "the distribution is strongly asymmetric , with an apparent tail toward values larger than 10% .",
    "pa values are mostly included in the interval 90@xmath5 - 160@xmath5 , with a mode @xmath0115@xmath5 .",
    "however many strongly deviating values were recorded , both in the past and in our observations . in particular all",
    "the pas lying between 50@xmath5 and 80@xmath5 , as well as one of those smaller than 10@xmath5 , were observed during our campaigns .",
    "we have obtained polarimetric data of pks  2155304 over long time intervals at an unprecedentedly high sampling rate .",
    "this allowed us to study in detail the long and short term polarization variability of the source , in particular the intranight events , and the shape of the polarized spectrum .",
    "possible dilution of the polarization due to the host galaxy of pks 2155304 , a giant elliptical , is expected to be wavelength dependent , because its spectrum should be significantly redder than that of the nucleus .",
    "in fact , given the measured magnitudes of the host galaxy ( @xmath11 , kotilainen falomo & scarpa 1998 and @xmath12 falomo et al .",
    "1991 ) , using the color indexes of a typical elliptical galaxy reported by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite we calculated the host galaxy flux @xmath13 in the bands .",
    "given the diameter of the projected aperture size for photopolarimetry ( 15@xmath2.8 ) and the effective de vaucouleurs radius for the host galaxy reported in @xcite ( 4@xmath14.5 in i gunn filter ) and @xcite ( 1@xmath14.75 in h band ) , we assume that 100% of the galaxy flux @xmath13 is included in our photometry . then , by subtracting it from the total light ( agn+galaxy ) represented by the magnitudes in table  [ fottab ] , we computed the agn flux @xmath15 . finally , in the hypothesis that the host galaxy only dilutes the polarization percentage of the agn with its total flux contribution , and ignoring depolarization by faraday rotation , we estimated the intrinsic polarization of the agn light according to @xmath16 where @xmath17 are from table  [ linpoltab ] .",
    "the result for the night of 28 august 1998 , one of the nights with best determined wdp , is a constant polarization p=7.1% over the bands . observed values of @xmath8 smaller than that of 28 august 1998 have all larger errors ( see table  [ dlogp ] ) , and therefore the corresponding corrected @xmath8 indices are not significantly below zero ( except the marginally significant case of 3 august 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , no strong evidence is present of negative wdp in our data .",
    "we note that our aperture includes also light from a galaxy located at 4@xmath2 from the bl lac nucleus ( g1 , falomo , pesce & treves 1993 ) .",
    "however its emission ( m@xmath18 ) does not contribute significantly to the depolarization .",
    "we also neglected any possible polarization induced by dust scattering in the host , this being usually several orders of magnitude smaller than the agn synchrotron polarization .",
    "past studies @xcite based on wdp have excluded that an accretion disk is contributing significantly to the optical emission of pks  2155304 , in which case higher polarization would be expected at longer wavelengths .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by @xcite based on the correlated behavior of the optical and uv light curves .",
    "our finding of a flat polarized spectrum is consistent with the conclusions of @xcite .    as proposed to explain optical polarization of grb",
    "afterglows @xcite , which exhibit polarization levels comparable to this and other blazars , one can envisage two scenarios : one with a highly ordered magnetic field , and one with highly tangled field .",
    "the two cases can be distinguished basing on position angle measurements : a constant pa indicating the former case , a variable pa the latter .",
    "our measurements of pks  2155304 , combined with the historical ones , suggest the following scenario . a component endowed with a regular magnetic field , usually dominant , is responsible for the preferred pa@xmath0115@xmath5 .",
    "the event recorded on 18 june 1998 , with a sudden decrease of p and rotation of the pa , suggests , instead of a large and rapid rotation of the magnetic field axis , a quenching of the ordered component , and the emerging of a different component , with a more tangled field .",
    "the lower level of polarization in this case can be explained with the presence of @xmath19 sub - regions , or  patches \" , each with size comparable to the coherence length of the magnetic field , so that the net p is given by p@xmath20/@xmath21 , where p@xmath20 is the polarization of each individual patch @xcite . from the measurement of p in low state ( @xmath01% ) and from the expected polarization of the synchrotron radiation ( @xmath070% ) one",
    "deduces a number of patches of @xmath05000 .",
    "the ordered - field component could be associated with a jet observed slightly off - axis , as envisaged by @xcite and @xcite . however , also the rise of a single component with orthogonal polarization plane could explain the sudden decrease in p accompanied by a 90@xmath1 rotation of the pa .",
    "smaller time scale ( intranight ) variations of p can be interpreted with physical changes within the jet ( modifications of the electron energy distribution law due to a propagating shock or small variations in magnetic field strength ) , while short term variations in pa can be due to geometric variations ( varying orientation of jet or magnetic field vector ) . note that a detailed model should account for the absence of correlation between the polarized and total flux that is shown in the observations reported here .",
    "previous reports of optical circular polarization measurements in blazars include marginal detections by @xcite for 3c  66a , oj  287 , and by @xcite for pks  0735 + 178 and pks  0422 + 004 . for pks  2155304 , only measurements with hst in the uv",
    "are reported @xcite .",
    "the absence of significant circular polarization , in a simple and homogeneous scenario , agrees with expectation that this should be a factor @xmath22 less than the linear p , where @xmath22 is the lorentz factor of the electrons , therefore out of reach of our accuracy , given that in blazars typically @xmath23 .",
    "more complex scenarios , with inhomogeneous jets and helical magnetic fields @xcite foresee larger relative values of circular polarization with respect to linear polarization .",
    "this could be invoked if the hint of circular polarization detection of @xmath00.2% on 1998 november 19 turned out to be real .",
    "since the polarized flux in pks  2155304 is produced by synchrotron radiation in the nuclear region , with very small dilution from the host galaxy , we expect p variations to be well correlated with those of the x - ray flux ( see also smith et al .",
    "for the same reason , we do not expect radio polarization variations to be correlated with the optical polarization , because the former originate in more extended regions , external to the inner nucleus .",
    "simultaneous monitoring of pks  2155304 at optical to x - ray frequencies could help discerning the exact causes of small time scale variability and advance our understanding of the physical behavior of  blue \" , synchrotron dominated , blazars .",

    "<S> the polarized and total flux of the bl lac object pks  2155304 were monitored intensively and simultaneously in the optical ubvri bands with the turin photopolarimeter at the casleo 2.15  m telescope during 4 campaigns in june , august , november 1998 and august 1999 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective observation time amounted to @xmath047 hours . </S>",
    "<S> pks  2155304 showed a linear polarization percentage ( p ) usually ranging between 3% and 7% and a polarization position angle ( pa ) mainly between 70@xmath1 and 120@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the highest temporal resolution of our observations , 15 minutes , is unprecedented for polarimetric monitoring of this source , and has allowed us to detect amplitude variations of the linear polarization percentage from 6 to 7.5% in time scales of hours . in some nights </S>",
    "<S> the polarization percentage seems to increase toward shorter wavelengths , however the polarized spectrum does not vary significantly with time . </S>",
    "<S> the most remarkable variability event occurred on 1998 june 18 , when the degree of linear polarization decreased by more than a factor 2 in one day in all bands , while the pa rotated by 90 deg . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the presence of two emission components , of different polarization degree and position angle . </S>",
    "<S> intranight variability of p and pa can be interpreted with small amplitude physical or geometrical changes within the jet . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the circular polarization over time intervals of days set upper limits of 0.2% . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous photometry taken with the turin photopolarimeter and with a ccd camera at crdoba astronomical observatory did not show light variations correlated with those of the linearly polarized flux . </S>"
