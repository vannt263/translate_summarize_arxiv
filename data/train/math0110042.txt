    "the problem of determining whether a balanced presentation of a group is geometric ( i.e. induced by a heegaard diagram of a closed orientable 3-manifold ) is of considerable interest in geometric topology and has already been examined by many authors ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the connections between cyclic coverings of @xmath3 branched over knots and cyclic presentations of their fundamental groups , induced by suitable heegaard diagrams , have recently been discussed in several papers ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the _ polynomial associated to the cyclic presentation _ @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the exponent sum of @xmath20 in @xmath5 . for further details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "some interesting examples of cyclically presented groups which are the fundamental groups of cyclic branched coverings of @xmath3 are the following :    * the fibonacci group @xmath21 is the fundamental group of the @xmath1-fold cyclic covering of @xmath3 branched over the figure - eight knot , for all @xmath22 ( see @xcite ) ; * the sieradski group @xmath23 is the fundamental group of the @xmath1-fold cyclic covering of @xmath3 branched over the trefoil knot , for all @xmath22 ( see @xcite ) ; * the fractional fibonacci group @xmath24 is the fundamental group of the @xmath1-fold cyclic covering of @xmath3 branched over the genus one two - bridge knot with conway coefficients @xmath25 $ ] , for all @xmath22 and @xmath26 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "notice that all the above cyclic presentations are geometric ( i.e. , they arise from suitable heegaard diagrams ) .    in order to investigate the relations between cyclic branched coverings of knots in @xmath3 and cyclic presentations for their fundamental groups , dunwoody introduced in @xcite a class of heegaard diagrams depending on six integers , having cyclic symmetry and defining cyclic presentations for the corresponding fundamental groups . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the 3-manifolds represented by these diagrams  the so - called _",
    "dunwoody manifolds _  are cyclic coverings of lens spaces , branched over @xmath0-knots . as a corollary , it has been proved that for some well - determined cases the manifolds turn out to be cyclic coverings of @xmath3 , branched over knots .",

    "note that @xmath0-knots are just a particular case of the notion of @xmath39-links in closed orientable 3-manifolds ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , which generalize the classical concept of bridge decomposition of links in @xmath3 .",
    "the class of @xmath0-knots is very important in the light of some results and conjectures involving dehn surgery on knots ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the subclass of @xmath0-knots in @xmath3 contains all torus knots ( trivially ) and all 2-bridge knots @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we prove that every @xmath1-fold strongly - cyclic branched covering of a @xmath0-knot admits a heegaard splitting of genus @xmath1 which encodes a cyclic presentation for the fundamental group ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the definition of strongly - cyclic branched coverings of @xmath0-knots will be given in section 3 , where we give necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness , using a representation of @xmath0-knots by elements of the mapping class group of the twice punctured torus ( see section 2 ) . in section 4",
    "we give a constructive algorithm to obtain the word defining the cyclic presentation .",
    "moreover , we show that the alexander polynomial @xmath40 of a @xmath0-knot @xmath41 is equal to the polynomial associated to the cyclic presentation of the fundamental group of the @xmath1-fold strongly - cyclic branched covering of @xmath42 , up to units of @xmath43 $ ] , when @xmath1 is greater than the degree of @xmath40 .",

    "since @xmath52 can be extended to a homeomorphism of the pair @xmath62 , the @xmath0-knots @xmath63 and @xmath64 are equivalent .",
