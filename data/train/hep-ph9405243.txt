    "the discovery of the top quark  one of the basic components of the standard model ",
    "is one of the most important goals for present and future experiments .",
    "indirect evidence for the existence of top is very strong , see for example @xcite , and the chances that it will be detected at the fermilab @xmath3 collider in the next few years are very high .",
    "once top is discovered , the next challenge for experiments is to measure its parameters  in particular its mass @xmath4  as precisely as possible .",
    "an unambiguous interpretation of experimental data and the determination of the top quark parameters relies on a clear quantitative understanding of the details of the production process , including the effects of gluon bremsstrahlung at the production stage @xcite . to quantify these effects",
    ", one can study the average amount of energy lost by the top quark  the simplest infrared - safe characteristic of gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "such a quantity is of potential practical importance in top mass determinations and , for energies above threshold , can be calculated quite straightforwardly without undue complications from non - perturbative phenomena or top - width effects @xcite .",
    "the key point here is the large top width , @xmath5 @xcite . since we know from experiment",
    "that the top mass is greater than about @xmath6 @xcite , the decay width is greater than the typical hadronic scale , @xmath7 , and so the top quark decays before non - perturbative effects like the formation of @xmath8-flavoured hadrons become important @xcite .",
    "the bremsstrahlung of gluons off the top quark can have an important impact (  radiation damage \" ) on various characterstics of the @xmath0 final state .",
    "taking @xmath9 as an example , it obviously affects the kinematical constraint @xmath10 , over and above the well - known effects of initial radiation .",
    "it also influences the form of the @xmath11 production vertex and measurements of the spectra of secondary leptons from @xmath8-decay @xcite .",
    "since one of the primary goals of a future @xmath1 collider would be to obtain an accurate measurement of the top mass @xmath4 , it is worth considering the impact of gluon radiation on such a measurement .",
    "there are two scenarios which have been considered @xcite",
    ". if the top is not too heavy , it can have sizeable kinetic energy and a mass measurement can be obtained from the invariant mass per hemisphere . in practice",
    ", the distributions in the heavy ( @xmath12 ) and light ( @xmath13 ) hemisphere masses can be fitted to a monte carlo simulation with @xmath4 as a free parameter . however",
    ", a gluon radiated from the @xmath14 system will distort this measurement .",
    "in particular the average difference in the hemisphere masses squared is proportional ( at @xmath15 ) to the average gluon energy , m_h^2 - m_l^2 = e_g .",
    "the more energy is carried away by the gluon , the more asymmetric the hemisphere masses . in practice , as we shall see , @xmath16 can be @xmath17 , which is much larger than the estimated statistical errors on @xmath4 from such analyses .",
    "a monte carlo which does not take full account of gluon radiation at the @xmath0 production stage could yield misleading results on the precision on @xmath4 .",
    "another method which is more suited to a heavier top quark is to reconstruct the mass directly from the three - jet final state @xcite . to avoid combinatorial and other backgrounds , the energy of the three - jet system is typically constrained to be close to the beam energy .",
    "but once again , the emission before the top decay of an energetic gluon can distort this constraint , since naively e_3  jet - e_beam = - e_g .",
    "once again we see the importance of taking the effects of gluon radiation into account in reconstructing the top mass .    in this paper we present results for gluon bremsstrahlung in @xmath18 which are of practical interest for physics studies of future linear @xmath1 colliders .",
    "we focus in particular on the gluon energy spectrum which , as we have seen , can have important implications for the top mass measurement .",
    "it is also straightforward , at least in principle , to extend our results to the more complicated case of hadronic @xmath0 production .",
    "since centre - of - mass energies @xmath19 at which multiple gluon radiation should be taken into account @xcite ( @xmath20 ) appear unrealistic for the foreseeable future , we need only consider a first - order perturbative analysis .",
    "this is calculationally quite straightforward , and in fact many parts of the calculation can be taken over from existing qed analyses @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first set up the theoretical framework which allows us to calculate the gluon radiation distribution for arbitrary production currents .",
    "we derive compact , analytical expressions for the gluon energy spectrum and its average value for vector , axial vector , scalar and pseudoscalar produciton currents .",
