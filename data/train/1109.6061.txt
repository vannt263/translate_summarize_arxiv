    "although the precise definition of handedness is often debated , it is widely accepted that roughly one in ten humans are left - handed @xcite . since prehistoric times , minor cultural and geographical variations in this percentage have been observed , but every historical population has shown the same strong bias toward right - handedness @xcite .",
    "both genetic and environmental factors seem to contribute to handedness for individuals @xcite ; nonetheless , individual handedness does not necessarily lead to species - level handedness .",
    "it is well - established that for an individual , lateralization can be advantageous @xcite : for example , it allows for specialization of brain function @xcite which may lead to enhanced cognition through parallel information processing @xcite . at the species level , however , the advantage of lateralization is not well understood @xcite .",
    "negative frequency - dependent selection alone , a primary mechanism by which polymorphisms are maintained @xcite , can only produce a balanced distribution of left- and right - handers due to the symmetry inherent in handedness .",
    "there have been various attempts to account for species - level asymmetry with the use of `` fitness functions '' @xcite .",
    "we propose a different approach to the problem .",
    "we define a function @xmath0 representing the mean probability that a right - handed individual ( male or female ) bears left - handed offspring in a given time period . a minimal model for the evolution of the societal fraction left - handed @xmath1 in terms of this arbitrary frequency - dependent transition rate @xmath0",
    "is given by @xmath2    we assume symmetry between right- and left - handers ( supplementary material section [ sec : the symmetry of handedness ] ) , so that we may write @xmath3 to obtain @xmath4 this function incorporates frequency - dependent selection effects , and can be approximated given a biological model for inheritance ( supplementary material section [ sec : phenotypic model for population dynamics ] , figure [ fig : ldotplot ] ) .    in a purely competitive society",
    ", it would be natural to assume @xmath5 to be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath1 .",
    "when left - handers are scarce , they have an advantage in physical confrontations due to their greater experience against right - handers and the right - handers lack of experience against them .",
    "as their numbers grow , that advantage weakens @xcite .",
    "however , in a purely cooperative society , physical confrontations would not exist , and all individuals would tend to the same handedness to increase cooperative efficiency and eliminate the fitness disadvantage of the minority handedness @xcite .",
    "( the modern presence of a higher accidental death rate for left - handers @xcite demonstrates that a fitness differential persists today . )",
    "thus @xmath6 would increase monotonically with @xmath1 .    for a system involving both cooperative and competitive interactions",
    ", we therefore write @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the degree of cooperation in interactions and the monotonicity properties of each component function are as given above . for physically reasonable choices of these functions ,",
    "there may exist one , three , or five fixed points @xmath9 in this system , depending on the value of @xmath10 .",
    "on @xmath11 . ( b ) nonmonotonic @xmath12 on @xmath13 .",
    "insets : @xmath14 and its component functions @xmath6 , @xmath5.,width=317 ]    figure [ fig1 ] shows the typical positions of stable and unstable equilibria for equation , where @xmath6 and @xmath5 have been chosen to be generic sigmoid functions ( sigmoid functions arise naturally in models where separate fitness functions exist for left- and right - handers  see supplementary material section [ sec : relating fitness functions to probabilistic transition rates ] ) .",
    "when the degree of cooperation @xmath10 is less than a critical threshold , the only stable equilibrium is @xmath15 : a 50/50 split between left - hand and right - hand dominant individuals .",
    "this is consistent with studies showing individual but not population - level bias in various species @xcite .",
    "when the degree of cooperation exceeds a critical threshold , two new stable equilibria appear as a result of either a subcritical or supercritical pitchfork bifurcation ( depending on the exact form of the function @xmath14 ) .",
    "these equilibria indicate population - level lateralization as seen in human society .",
    "the fraction right- or left - handed will depend on the exact value of the cooperation parameter @xmath10 .",
    "there is a qualitative difference between the two situations depicted in figure [ fig1 ] , a difference which holds for a broad class of sigmoid functions @xmath14 . in the case of the subcritical pitchfork ( figure [ fig1]a ) , no weak population lateralization",
    "should ever be observed since equilibria near 50% are unstable ; however , in the case of the supercritical pitchfork ( figure [ fig1]b ) , population lateralization near 50% will be possible , though only stable for a small range of values of @xmath10 .",
    "both suggest that weak population lateralization ( fractions .17ex@xmath16 ) should be rare in the natural world , while indicating that a high degree of cooperation may be responsible for the strong lateralization ( fractions .17ex@xmath17 ) observed in some social animals ( e.g. , humans , parrots @xcite ) .",
    "thus far we have attempted to describe the evolution of the fraction left - handed in populations of lateralized individuals . ideally , we would compare predicted equilibria of equation to data from animal populations exhibiting varying degrees of cooperation . for most species , however , quantifying the degree of cooperation is difficult , and data on population - level lateralization is scarce and sometimes contradictory .",
    "this lack of information about the natural world leads us to examine the proxy situation of athletics , where data on handedness and cooperation is more easily accessible .    to explain the observed fraction of athletes left - handed , it is important to model the selection process because athletics , unlike evolution , should not cause changes in the population s background rate of laterality .",
    "we treat athletic skill s as a normally distributed random variable , and assume that minority handedness creates a frequency - dependent shift @xmath18 that modifies the randomly distributed skill .",
    "we then model an ideal selection process as choosing the @xmath19 most skilled players from a population of @xmath20 interested individuals . such a model ( derived in detail in supplementary material section [ sec : derivation of athletic selection model ] ) predicts that the professional fraction left - handed @xmath21 will depend on the fraction selected @xmath22 , and is determined implicitly by the equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the background rate of left - handedness , erfc is the complementary error function , @xmath25 is the normalized cut - off in skill level for selection , and @xmath26 is the normalized skill advantage for left - handers . here @xmath9 represents the fraction of the population that would be left - handed in a world consisting only of interactions through the sport under consideration .",
    "its value is determined from equation , with a choice of parameter @xmath10 appropriate for the sport under consideration ( @xmath14 is reinterpreted as the mean probability that a right - handed player is replaced by a left - hander in a given time period ) .",
    "note that @xmath21 must lie between @xmath27 and @xmath9 : with very high selectivity @xmath28 equation implies that @xmath29 , and with very low selectivity @xmath30 @xmath31 .",

    "dashed line represents perfect agreement between predicted and observed values .",
    "vertical error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals ( @xmath43 ) ; horizontal error bars correspond to predictions using plus or minus one order of magnitude in @xmath20 , the primary source of uncertainty .",
    "left - handed advantage @xmath44 where @xmath45 and both @xmath9 and @xmath21 vary from sport to sport ( see table [ datatable ] and supplementary material section [ sec : data summary]),width=317 ]    figure [ fig2 ] shows our application of equation to various professional sports . to reduce arbitrary free parameters , we assume that the cooperativity @xmath10 is close to zero for physically competitive sports and one for sports ( e.g. , golf ) that require lateralized equipment or strategy .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] then implies that the ideal equilibrium fraction left - handed @xmath9 will be 50% when @xmath10 is close to zero , and will be either 0% or 100% when @xmath46 .    the predictions for figure [ fig2 ]",
    "were made by varying a single free parameter @xmath47 , the constant of proportionality for the frequency - dependent skill advantage @xmath48 . to avoid over - fitting",
    ", we took this to be a constant across all sports ; given sufficient data , different values of @xmath47 could be estimated independently for each sport .",
    "the fraction selected @xmath49 was estimated from the ratio of professional athletes to the number of frequent participants for each sport ( see supplementary material section [ sec : data summary ] for details ) .    for the sport of baseball , the great abundance of historical statistical information allows us to validate our proposed selection mechanism .",
    "to do so , we use our model to predict the cumulative fraction left - handed @xmath50 as a function of rank @xmath51 , then compare to data .    in sports where highly - rated players interact with other highly - rated players preferentially ( e.g. , boxing )",
    ", we expect the left - handed advantage @xmath52 to be rank - dependent ( i.e. , depending on the fraction left - handed at rank @xmath51 ) .",
    "however , within professional baseball leagues , all players interact with all other players at nearly the same rate , so the left - handed advantage @xmath53 should be independent of rank , i.e. , a constant .",
    "this leads us ( see supplementary material section [ sec : derivation of athletic selection model ] for derivation ) to the equation @xmath54     represents the left - handed fraction of all u.s .",
    "born players that finished a season ranked in the top @xmath51 by total hits .",
    "the left - handed advantage @xmath55 was computed by finding the least - squares best fit .",
    "this value differs slightly from the value used for baseball in figure [ fig2 ] ( @xmath56 ) suggesting that , in practice , the proportionality constant @xmath47 may vary from sport to sport .",
    ", width=317 ]    figure [ fig3 ] shows the predictions of equation as applied to the top - ranked baseball players from 1871 to 2009 .",
    "only one free parameter was varied : the left - handed advantage @xmath57 .",
    "all other parameters were constrained by known data @xcite .",
    "the surprisingly good fit to this nontrivial curve can be seen as supporting evidence for the selection model .",
    "together with the accuracy of predictions in figure [ fig2 ] , this supports the conclusion that the equilibria of equation are indeed relevant to real - world lateralized systems .",
    "despite the good agreement of our predictions with real - world data , we acknowledge that there are limitations in reducing a complex adaptive system to a simple mathematical model .",
    "our model includes undetermined functions that would be difficult to measure precisely ( although we found that qualitative predictions are robust  see supplementary material section [ sec : parameter sensitivity analysis for probabilistic model ] ) .",
    "however , they can be roughly approximated from available data and may be easier to estimate than fitness functions proposed in other models .",
    "sports data may not be completely analogous to data from the natural world ; hence , quantitative analysis of lateralization in social animal groups may be a fruitful line of future research .    given the limited data on population - level lateral bias in the natural world , we feel that analysis of athletics provides new insight into the evolutionary origins of handedness .",
    "our model predictions match the observed distribution of handedness in baseball with just a single free parameter .",
    "when applied to 12 groups of elite athletes , the same model does a good job of estimating the fraction left - handed in each , suggesting that the proposed balance between cooperation and competition accurately predicts the ideal equilibrium distribution of handedness .",
    "our model is general enough to be applied to any species of animal , and may also have use in understanding population - level lateralized adaptations other than handedness , both physical and behavioural .",
    "the model we have presented is the first to take a dynamical systems approach to the problem of laterality .",
    "it allows for the prediction of conditions under which population - level lateral bias can be expected to emerge in the animal world and its evolution over time .",
    "we exploit the connection between natural selection and selection in professional sports by introducing a novel data set on handedness among athletes , demonstrating a clear relationship between cooperative social behaviour and population - level lateral bias .",

    "thus the population - level bias can be maintained through a balance between a frequency - dependent fitness function and a constant fitness cost .",
    "an alternate model by ghirlanda et  al .",
    "@xcite  suggests that the combination of `` antagonistic '' and `` synergistic '' interactions and their associated frequency - dependent fitness functions can create an evolutionarily stable equilibrium with an asymmetric ( and non - trivial ) distribution of lateralization .    while both models have merit , they disagree on a fundamental question : are left- and right - handedness interchangeable ?",
    "in other words , is a mirror image world of 90% left - handers and 10% right - handers equally plausible ?",
    "billiard et al",
    ".  suggest that the fitness costs `` such as lower height and reduced longevity ... are not likely to be frequency - dependent . ''",
    "thus these fitness costs break the symmetry and guarantee that only the observed handedness distribution is possible .",
    "however , the aforementioned fitness costs have only been observed in a biased population consisting of lateralized individuals .",
    "for example , aggleton et al .",
    "@xcite  show that left - handers are more likely to die prematurely , and that this effect is at least partially due to `` increased vulnerability to both accidental death and death during warfare . ''",
    "they go on to argue that `` the most likely explanation for the increase in accidental death among the left - handed men concerns their need to cope in a world full of right - handed tools , machines , and instruments . ''",
    "clearly if left - handedness were more prevalent than right - handedness , then left - handed tools would also be more common , and , as a result , right - handers instead would experience increased risk of accidental death .",
    "thus , it is likely that these fitness costs are frequency - dependent and symmetric .",
    "in contrast to billiard et al . , ghirlanda s model assumes that left- and right - handedness are indeed interchangeable .",
    "given an initial distribution of 50% left - handers and 50% right - handers , this model predicts that both the observed distribution and its mirror image are equally likely equilibrium outcomes . on this point",
    ", our probabilistic model agrees with ghirlanda et al .",
    "given the fact that there is no reason to expect that right - handedness is inherently superior to left - handedness from a fitness perspective , we assume that the probabilistic transition rates satisfy the symmetry condition @xmath58 .",
    "the probabilistic model described in the main text provides a description of the population dynamics from a top - down perspective .",
    "however , it may be more intuitive to consider the dynamics from a bottom - up perspective . here",

    "from an evolutionary perspective , the expected number of offspring that individuals produce should be dependent on their fitness . with all other factors being equal ,",

    "the resulting dynamical system governed by equation   has either 3 or 5 fixed points : ( @xmath105 ) or ( @xmath106 ) where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are stable .",

    "we now determine the relationship between fitness functions @xmath120 , @xmath121 and probabilistic transition rates @xmath0 , @xmath122 . recall that @xmath0 represents the probabilistic transition rate from right to left .",
    "clearly , @xmath0 must be non - negative .",
    "also , it should reach a maximum ( minimum ) when the difference in fitness between left- and right - handers is at a maximum ( minimum ) .",
    "the simplest example of such a function is @xmath123 , where @xmath124 are constants guaranteeing that @xmath0 remains positive . by symmetry , @xmath125 and @xmath58 .",
    "thus @xmath126 .",
    "transition rates defined in this way satisfy the symmetry relation @xmath127 and , as such , are sigmoidal for many different types of fitness functions",
    ".    we should note that in this model , the probability @xmath128 that a given individual switches from right to left within time @xmath129 is non - zero even when @xmath130 . in such a situation ,",
    "the probability that a given left - hander switches is @xmath131 .",
    "however , if right - handers are much more prevalent than left - handers , the total number of switches from right to left may still outweigh the number from left to right .",
    "in other words , it is possible that @xmath132 . this would cause the fraction left - handed to increase despite right - handers having a higher fitness .    also , if for some @xmath133 , @xmath134 , then @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "so if @xmath137 , the fraction left - handed will increase even when the fitness is equal for left- and right - handers .",
    "in our model , having equal fitnesses does not necessarily lead to equilibrium .    despite the differences between our formulation and a fitness - based formulation , the predictions are similar .",
    "if we use the fitness functions @xmath138 similar to those proposed by ghirlanda et al .  we can generate @xmath0 and @xmath122 ( which are sigmoid as expected ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : ldotplot_fitness ] we plot the resulting function @xmath139 for appropriate parameter values ( such as @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) and observe a graph very similar to figure  [ fig : ldotplot ] .",

    "professional sports are artificial systems that involve varying degrees of competitive and cooperative activities .",
    "their participants undergo a selection process through tryouts that is in some ways analogous to natural selection . additionally , handedness data for professional athletes is widely available .",
    "thus , athletics provide an ideal opportunity to test whether our model s predictions are consistent with data from selective systems .",
    "there is a fundamental difference between selection in professional sports and natural selection . in natural selection ,",
    "the distribution of a trait within a population changes in response to selection pressure , modifying the gene pool .",
    "professional athletes , however , represent only a small segment of the much larger human population .",
    "changes in the distribution of a trait among professional athletes are unlikely to influence the gene pool in the human population ; furthermore , most professional sports have not existed for the time scales required to significantly modify the gene pool . as a result ,",
    "the population of professional athletes must draw new members from a pool that consists of about 90% right - handers .",
    "thus , direct comparison of our model to sports data is not possible : instead , we must account for this more complex selection process in order to make predictions that _ are _ applicable to real - world sports .    to begin , we define @xmath107 to be the fixed point predicted by the probabilistic model  described in the main text .",
    "this represents the ideal equilibrium distribution of left - handedness in a hypothetical world where all interaction occurs through the sport under consideration .",
    "we assume that skill is normally distributed throughout the population with mean @xmath145 and standard deviation @xmath146 . because left - handedness is relatively rare",
    ", this trait should provide a competitive advantage in sports involving direct physical confrontation .",
    "let @xmath1 represent the fraction left - handed within a sport .",
    "when @xmath1 deviates from @xmath107 , the sport is not at its ideal equilibrium state , and left - handers must experience a shift in skill @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that professional sports operate efficiently , that is , they select players exclusively according to skill level .",
    "then the distributions of skill among left- and right - handers satisfy @xmath147 @xmath148 where @xmath149 in this formulation , when the ideal equilibrium fraction of left - handedness is achieved , their is no advantage to possessing either handedness and the individuals are selected according their intrinsic skill .    in most sports , individuals must undergo a tryout in order to demonstrate sufficient skill for participation . as a result",
    "only a fraction of the total population is allowed to participate in the sport at a given level of competition .",
    "we define the fraction selected @xmath150 , where @xmath19 is the number of individuals selected and @xmath20 is the size of the total population .",
    "@xmath49 will determine a minimum skill cutoff @xmath151 for participation according to the relation @xmath152 where @xmath27 represents the background rate of left - handedness ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "we can simplify this expression by normalizing the various parameters by the standard deviation : we set @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 to get @xmath157 in this formulation , the fraction left - handed among the individuals selected will be represented by the first term on the right - hand side of equation   divided by the entire expression , @xmath158    after many tryouts , the fraction left - handed within a sport will stabilize with the @xmath159 .",
    "this equilibrium fraction represents the observed fraction left - handed among professional athletes , thus we call it @xmath21 .",
    "so , the equilibrium state is implicitly determined by @xmath160~.\\ ] ] this model has the following properties :    * if @xmath161 , then @xmath162 .",
    "* if the sport is not selective at all , in the limit @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) , @xmath165 as this means that selection is independent of skill .",
    "* as the sport becomes infinitely selective , @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) , @xmath168 .",
    "in other words , the ideal equilibrium fraction is achieved when the sport is infinitely selective .",
    "( to see this , assume that @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "expand in a taylor series about @xmath171 and take the limit @xmath166 to find that @xmath172 .",
    "thus @xmath173 and @xmath174 , so @xmath175 . )",
    "using this model , we employed numerical techniques to compute the solutions @xmath21 for a variety of sports , and then compared these results to the observed fractions left - handed as seen in figure  2 .",
    "this model can also be extended to examine how the distribution of handedness varies within a single sport .",
    "if left - handedness is a desirable trait ( that is , it provides a skill advantage at equilibrium ) , then we expect that it should be very prevalent among the most skilled individuals due to the selection mechanism . to see this , we consider the case of baseball .",
    "it is clear that in baseball , @xmath176 since the sport involves primarily competitive interactions ( the observed @xmath177 ) .",
    "thus , left - handedness is a desirable trait for potential professionals as it will provide a particular skill advantage in batting . at the professional level ,",
    "most hitters face the same set of pitchers and compete indirectly with one - another for roster spots .",
    "they should therefore be expected to experience the same skill advantage due to handedness . in other words",
    ", @xmath178 is a constant ( in sports like boxing , however , where individuals compete more frequently with others near their own rank , the skill advantage would be a rank - dependent function @xmath51 , @xmath179 ) .",
    "ranking the hitters by skill , we observe that the fraction left - handed above rank @xmath51 should satisfy @xmath180 where @xmath181 satisfies @xmath182    using this result , we plotted the predicted fraction left - handed as a function of rank as seen in figure  3 .",
    "this model predicts a non - trivial shape for the distribution of handedness within baseball that is consistent with the observed distribution . this is a strong indication that this athletic selection model provides a good mathematical approximation for the tryout - based selective mechanism within professional sports",
    "data used in generation figure  2 came from a variety of sources .",
    "the total number of participants came from surveys conducted by the sporting goods manufacturers association in 2009 @xcite , except for men s and women s fencing , where participant numbers were extrapolated from data published by the national federation of state high school associations @xcite .",
    "the number of professional players came from listings of top - rated players ( the only ones for which handedness was readily available ) at the internet urls indicated in table [ datatable ] , with the exception of baseball , football , and hockey , where numbers are absolute totals .",
    "when handedness was not available in tabulated form , it was evaluated based on public photos of players in action .    in table",
    "[ datatable ] , the predictions for the fraction left - handed were generated using an estimate of the ideal equilibrium @xmath107 for each sport .",
    "the appropriate value for @xmath107 depends primarily on the degree of cooperation @xmath10 for the sport .",
    "this parameter is difficult to estimate in sports that possess clear cooperative and competitive elements .",
    "however , in order to observe fixed points other than @xmath183 , @xmath10 must exceed a threshold that appears to be relatively high for the types of transition rates considered in this paper ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "so , we assumed that @xmath183 for sports primarily involving direct confrontations : baseball ( batters vs. pitchers ) , boxing , fencing , table tennis , hockey ( defensemen and forwards ) .    some sports ( or particular positions within sports ) , however , possess highly lateralized equipment , positioning or strategy .",
    "for these sports , it is ideal for all individuals to possess the same handedness ; so , the minority handedness will be selected against .",
    "for example , in football , blocking schemes are often designed to protect a quarterback s blind side . as a result , it is beneficial for all quarterbacks on the roster to possess the same handedness in order to minimize variations of the offensive sets .",
    "consequently , we assume that for quarterbacks in football , golfers , and left and right wings in hockey the value of @xmath184 , i.e. , @xmath185 .",
    "in the probabilistic model , there are two unknown functions @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "while general properties of these functions such as monotonicity are known , the appropriate form for these functions is unknown and is difficult to determine from data .",
    "the generic sigmoid functions      satisfy restrictions on @xmath14 for @xmath189 and capture the essential fixed point behaviour ( @xmath190 set the steepness of the curves ) .",
    "unfortunately , these equations introduce two new parameters that may alter the dynamics . to examine the sensitivity of the model to these parameters",
    ", we assumed @xmath9 was the fixed point of the system .",
    "we then computed the partial derivatives of @xmath9 with respect to each parameter . in the vicinity of @xmath191 , the observed ratio of left - handers in human populations , and in the range of @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194",
    ", we found that @xmath195    thus for a wide range of parameter values , @xmath196 and @xmath197 near the fixed point @xmath198 .",
    "in other words , the location of the fixed point is more sensitive to @xmath10 than @xmath199 and @xmath200 by several orders of magnitude for physically allowable @xmath47-values . therefore we are justified in ignoring the effects of individual choices of @xmath199 and @xmath200 in order to focus on the effects of the choice of @xmath10 .",
    "we believe these results are robust for various different sigmoid functions @xmath201 ."
