    "the application of shear flow to dense liquids can dramatically change their transport and relaxation processes .",
    "even if the timescale set by the applied shear rate @xmath0 is slow compared to a typical single - particle relaxation time @xmath1 ( i.e. , the pclet number @xmath2 ) , it can interfere with and supersede the slow relaxation times @xmath3 of the system ( i.e. , the `` dressed '' pclet , or weissenberg number @xmath4 ) . in this case , the slow relaxation of the system is usually found to be accelerated by the shear flow , a phenomenon known from colloidal suspensions as shear thinning , because a pronounced decrease in the apparent viscosity results . to this decrease corresponds an increase in the single - particle diffusivities .",
    "these changes in transport processes are found even if the average static structure of the system ( at least as measured through two - point correlation functions ) changes only slightly .",
    "the drastic change from equilibrium to steady - state transport properties begs the question about transient dynamics : what happens if such a slowly relaxing liquid is suddenly subjected to shear , regarding its dynamical correlations as the system progresses from equilibrium towards its steady state ?",
    "one can investigate these effects most easily by looking at the waiting - time dependent dynamical two - time correlation functions : switching on the external shear flow at @xmath5 , one measures the correlations of dynamical variables between some waiting time @xmath6 , and a correlation time @xmath7 .",
    "of particular interest are the so - called transient correlation functions , obtained for @xmath8 , to be compared with the reference cases of equilibrium and steady state .    in the present contribution",
    ", we address this issue by presenting an approximate relationship between these three relevant types of dynamical two - point correlation functions .",
    "recently , the dynamical evolution after switching on shear flow of steady rate @xmath0 has been addressed @xcite by a combination of techniques : theoretically , in the framework of mode - coupling theory ( mct ) for colloidal rheology and an integration - through transients ( itt ) approach , experimentally , using confocal microscopy , and with computer simulation for a damped newtonian - dynamics model .",
    "all three methods yield a consistent picture : a shear stress @xmath9 builds up at @xmath10 after switch - on , but does not grow monotonically towards its steady - state value @xmath11 .",
    "it rather exhibits an intermediate `` overshoot '' at times corresponding to an overall strain @xmath12 .",
    "such stress overshoot phenomena are in fact well - known @xcite , but despite their ubiquity , their microscopic origin , in particular for the fully homogeneous flow profiles studied , remains somewhat vague . in ref .",
    "@xcite , simulations were able to connect it to a sudden change in the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) of a tracer particle : even for the directions perpendicular to the shear flow where no explicit advection occurs , one observes a super - diffusive regime as the transient msd , @xmath13 , leaves the equilibrium curve around @xmath14 , to cross over to the ( much larger ) steady - state curve which it reaches at @xmath15 . in this regime ,",
    "md simulations found motion to be almost ballistic , @xmath16 with @xmath17 . in experiment ( closer to brownian dynamics ) , this superdiffusion was not as pronounced , yielding @xmath18 only slightly larger than @xmath19 . within mct - itt and an additional ad - hoc approximation",
    "akin to a generalized stokes - einstein relation , it could be shown that the stress overshoot and superdiffusion are directly connected and originate from an overrelation of microscopic stresses : the transient stress autocorrelation function ( called a dynamical shear modulus ) does not decay monotonically to zero , but exhibits a `` dip '' in the corresponding strain regime where it becomes slightly negative just before reaching its zero long - time limit .",
    "thus , the details on the evolution from equilibrium dynamics to far - from - equilibrium dynamics under shear are encoded in transient correlation functions .",
    "this raises a two - fold interest in these transient correlation functions : first , given information on both equilibrium and the steady state , what can one infer about the transient dynamics ?",
    "second , recalling that mct and itt generically build upon the transient correlation functions , can one test their generic implications ?",
    "the relationship among the various two - point dynamical correlation functions that we present in the following , builds upon the itt formalism , without explicit reference to mct .",
    "it should thus hold quite generally , at least qualitatively .",
    "we demonstrate this by comparing with computer - simulation data for both a brownian and a non - brownian system . for dense liquids and colloidal suspensions in equilibrium ,",
    "it is a well - tested paradigm , that the long - time behavior of the correlation functions does not ( up to an overall time unit ) depend on the type of short - time motion , be it ballistic ( newtonian dynamics ) or diffusive ( brownian colloidal particles ) .",
    "this in fact defines the regime of quiescent `` structural relaxation '' , where slow relaxation processes arising from collective caging of particles govern the dynamics of the system .",
    "this equivalence of newtonian and brownian systems does not need to hold far from equilibrium , although similar shear - thinning effects are seen both in colloidal suspensions and atomistic metallic melts .",
    "indeed , differences were observed regarding the extent of superdiffusive motion in the transient msd @xcite .",
    "note that in the md simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , shear was implemented through the boundaries of the ( periodically repeated ) simulation box only , by lees - edwards boundary conditions .",
    "hence , particles at the center of the box remain at rest also for a short time after switching on the flow , until a linear shear profile propagates from the boundaries towards the center .",
    "it was argued that this time scale is short compared to the @xmath20 of interest . in brownian dynamics , the issue can be set aside , as there one immediately modifies the solvent flow profile throughout the box when implementing shear ( in addition to lees - edwards boundary conditions ) .",
    "this situation also being closer to what mct - itt models , is another motivation to complement the md simulation data already partially discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite with new simulations incorporating diffusive short - time motion .",
    "the peculiar features of the transient correlation functions not only highlight possible differences in the non - equilibrium response of the different system types . they also provide direct tests of the mct - itt formalism . at the core of itt is a reformulation of non - equilibrium averages in terms of history integrals over equilibrium averages where the full nonequilibrium time - dependence is kept in the evolution of the dynamical variables . in the case of steady shear ,",
    "this is precisely the transient correlation function measurable in experiment or simulation where a shear flow is switched on immediately at @xmath5 .    while the transient ( @xmath8 ) correlation function is the natural object to be treated in mct - itt , steady - state and more generally @xmath21-dependent correlation functions have , in this approach , to be calculated afterwards .",
    "our main result here enables mct - itt to do just that : by obtaining equilibrium and transient correlation functions from any theory , correlators for all @xmath21 can be expressed .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : after some notational clarification ( sec .  [",
    "sec : corr ] ) , we present in sec .  [",
    "sec : susc ] the main theoretical derivation of our formulas .",

    "given two dynamical fluctuating variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i.e. , functions with zero average that depend on the state - point @xmath24 of the system , one defines the two - point correlation function @xmath25 for @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 here , @xmath28 denotes the conditional probability that the system resides at state point @xmath24 at time @xmath29 , given it was at state point @xmath30 at time @xmath21 .",

    "note that we do not in general assume @xmath46 to decay to zero for @xmath50 : in ( idealized ) glass states , it attains a finite positive long - time limit , called the nonergodicity factor or glass form factor @xcite .    in comparing with computer simulations , we set for simplicity @xmath51 to be the one - particle microscopic number density , @xmath52 $ ] with wave vector @xmath53 and the position of the singled - out particle @xmath54 . to further simplify the discussion ,",

    "we generally consider a system of @xmath61 spherical particles without internal degrees of freedom , enclosed in a volume @xmath62 .",
    "choosing units , we set the thermal energy @xmath63 throughout . for the stochastic - dynamics simulations as well as the theory , we assume diffusive short - time motion governed by a bare diffusion coefficient @xmath64 ; we do not take into account explicit solvent or hydrodynamic interactions among the particles .",

    "the same qualitative trend with wave number holds as in the comparison with the ed - bd simulation , but the curve shape predicted for decay of the transient correlation function from the stationary one is markedly different from the one observed , especially in the initial decay from the plateau .",

    "[ fig : compsimmsd ] . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : bd ] , we have chosen @xmath324 ( ed - bd ) and @xmath325 ( md ) to approximate the stationary msd in the simulations .",

    "the agreement is then seen to be qualitative again , with some quantitative deviations mostly regarding the logarithmic slope of the msd at intermediate times .",
    "these deviations are larger for the md data than for the ed - bd , and it will be interesting to explore further these differences in the waiting - time dependent evolution of sheared systems obeying different types of short - time dynamics .",
    "it appears that , while for the transient dynamics at small @xmath21 , possibly qualitative differences are found between md and bd ( see the discussion above in conjunction with fig .  [",
    "fig : compsimmsdtw ] ) , this does not seem to be the case for either the quiescent or the stationary case ",

    "we have presented an approximate connection among the different dynamical two - point correlation functions characterizing the nonequilibrium dynamics following a sudden commencement of linear shear flow .",
    "it describes the evolution from the pre - shear equilibrium state to the stationary state attained under shear after sufficiently long waiting times .",
    "the approximations have been derived following the integration - through transients procedure as a general tool to evaluate averages involving the unknown nonequilibrium distribution function in terms of history integrals over the known equilibrium one .",
    "itt is exact in principle , but in evaluating the two - time three - point correlation functions , we are forced to introduce approximations .",
    "here we have made the assumption that the dynamical variables in whose evolution we are interested in , are , in their evolution from equilibrium to steady state , dominated by an overlap with the microscopic stress tensor , or more generally the fluctuations arising from applying the nonequilibrium part of the time - evolution operator to the distribution function .",
    "an analysis of two different sets of computer simulation data close to the glass transition for various wave numbers , shear rates , and waiting times suggests that our approximative formulas do indeed capture the essential features of the dynamical evolution from equilibrium to steady state . to test the generality of the discussed effects with respect to different short - time dynamics and dimensionality , we both analyzed previous 3d newtonian molecular dynamics data and performed 2d event - driven brownian dynamics ( ed - bd ) simulations leading to diffusive ( overdamped stochastic ) short - time motion .",
    "we have made plausible the approximations by referring to a schematic model of mode - coupling theory that allows to calculate all the desired quantities numerically with high precision .",
    "the theoretical predictions are seen to broadly agree with previous results on both molecular - dynamics computer simulations and on colloidal experiments reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also with the hard - sphere stochastic - dynamics simulations we performed . as a general trend",
    ", the transient correlation functions follow the equilibrium ones for times up to @xmath326 ; after this strain is reached , they deviate and decay much more rapidly in the regime of high dressed pclet numbers we are interested in . for the tagged - particle density correlation functions , the deviation sets in earlier for larger wave number ( tested in the gradient direction ) . for smaller @xmath327 ( or in the case of the msd ) , the decisive strain is closer to @xmath328 : as mentioned before @xcite , this value is suspiciously close to a typical particle localization length , supporting the picture that the steep decay of the transient correlation function marks the breaking of nearest - neighbor cages under shear .",
    "as the waiting time @xmath21 increases , this steep decay , found to be super - exponential in our model , broadens to settle on the @xmath41 stationary limit for waiting times of @xmath309 .",
    "for most cases , this gives rise to an ordering of @xmath21-dependent correlators , with the transient , @xmath8 , correlator being the largest ( i.e. slowest ) , and the stationary , @xmath208 , correlator being the smallest ( i.e. fastest ) in an intermediate window of rescaled times @xmath329 .",
    "however , this ordering is violated for waiting times corresponding to strains @xmath284 where a non - monotonic variation is observed in the shear stress after startup , the so called stress overshoot .",
    "our approximation recovers this subtlety .    as a side note",
    ", it should be mentioned that in the case of switching on steady shear , the waiting - time dependent correlation functions are found to all decay on time scales of @xmath149 when leaving the linear - response regime , i.e. , when @xmath148 .",
    "this is in notable difference to waiting - time dependences usually discussed in the aging dynamics of glasses following a sudden temperature quench or in soft - matter systems @xcite , where the final relaxation time strongly increases as a function of increasing @xmath21 , giving rise to an ordering of correlators that is the reverse of what we discussed here .",
    "let us remark that our schematic - model analysis suggests to discuss the peculiarities of the transient dynamics in colloidal and non - colloidal systems in separate aspects : for both types of short - time motion `` compressed exponential '' relaxation is found in simulations , which in colloidal systems can be seen as the hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics ( as the equilibrium dynamics is confined to show at most exponential relaxation for any correlation function as long as only structural relaxation is involved ) .",
    "in fact , the nonequilibrium steady - state dynamics according to our observations is again better described by pure exponentials , so that the compressed exponentials may be the signature of nonequilibrium and non - stationary relaxation .",
    "this faster - than - exponential relaxation does , however , not directly translate into a super - diffusive ( or even ballistic ) regime in the mean - squared displacement , another feature observed in simulations on both types of system .",
    "as already investigated in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , this latter feature can arise independently and is directly related to the stress overshoot .",
    "the mechanism by which the dynamics evolves from equilibrium via transient to stationary dynamics appears to have aspects that are independent on the details of the short - time motion : the points in time where deviations are first seen from the equilibrium correlator , and last seen with respect to the steady state , are determined by the total accumulated strain @xmath146 .",
    "the decisive value of @xmath328 turns out to be suspiciously close to a typical cage size in supercooled liquids , as has been noted previously .",
    "we reiterate that this generality in the evolution from equilibrium to steady state does not mean that an equally strong statement holds as it does in equilibrium , where the long - time part of the dynamics itself is independent on the type of short - time dynamics .",
    "in fact , analyzing mean - squared displacements and tagged - particle density - correlation functions from both ed - bd and md simulations , the md ones appear to show a somewhat stronger transient effect than the ed - bd ones .",
    "determining effective exponents for the msd ( from a logarithmic derivative ) , the md data gives larger deviations from sub - diffusive structural relaxation .",
    "the compressed - exponential exponents obtained from the incoherent scattering function can be significantly larger than @xmath330 in md , but remain below @xmath330 for the ed - bd data we analyzed .",
    "this occurs in a time window , where for the quiescent system structural relaxation prevails , and where one thus expects universal aspects of slow relaxation that are independent of the short - time dynamics .",
    "it should be noted that the simulation models are different , so that we can not exclude the difference observed in the transients being due to details of the interparticle interactions .",
    "our approximation correspondingly shows largest deviations when relating equilibrium , transient , and stationary correlation functions at large @xmath286 for the molecular - dynamics simulation , even though it performs surprisingly well for the same md data when restricting it to smaller waiting times .",
    "this may indicate that the peculiar form of the @xmath8 transient in molecular dynamics is not fully captured by considering all dynamical relaxations to be governed by the dynamics of the potential part of the local stress tensor ( as we did to arrive at our approximation ) , but that non - potential parts of the dynamics may play a role in this regime , too .",
    "nevertheless , the overall quality of the waiting - time - derivative approximation ( eq .  ) is found to be remarkably accurate .",
    "this lends further support to the earlier discussion of nonequilibrium fluctuation - dissipation ratios and einstein relations within mct and its schematic models , as the equivalent approximations have been used there @xcite .",
    "we wish to acknowledge fruitful and stimulating discussions with matthias fuchs , jrgen horbach , joseph m. brader and jochen zausch .",
    "we thank jochen zausch for providing us with his molecular - dynamics simulation data .",

    "m.  k.  acknowledges funding through the international research training group `` soft condensed matter '' , irtg 667 , as well as the sonderforschungsbereich transregio 6 `` physics of colloidal dispersions in external fields '' .",
    "for the hard sphere system , the instantaneous shear modulus diverges , rendering the projector @xmath331 leading to eqs .   and ill - defined . for a proper treatment of this singular limit , one can use instead @xmath332 for some fixed small @xmath333 . with this choice , eq .   remains unmodified , but the insertion of @xmath334\\operatorname{{\\mathcal p}}_\\sigma(s_0)\\exp[-\\operatorname{\\omega}^\\dagger s_0]$ ] changes eq .   to @xmath335 where the integrand remains finite for all @xmath336 .",
    "the approximation thus , in the case of hard spheres , consists of coupling the variable @xmath217 to the shear stress at some small cutoff time @xmath333 ."
