    "reactions initiated by electromagnetic probes play a central role in our understanding of the structure - dynamics of nucleons and nuclei . in the latter case",
    "both quasifree @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions have been extensively studied .",
    "these two processes have a great deal in common in that both reactions result in the removal of a single proton from the target , via interaction with a photon , exciting essentially the same residual states .",
    "the first of the reactions is mediated by virtual photons , whereas the second is initiated by real ones .",
    "moreover the two reactions complement each other in providing information about different momentum regions of single particle wave functions .",
    "it has long been recognized that the similarity between the two reactions could be very useful in enhancing our understanding of the reaction mechanisms@xcite . a recent study by ireland and van der",
    "steenhoven @xcite has compared results of non - relativistic dwia calculations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions on a number of light and medium - weight nuclei . under the reasonable assumption",
    "that the mechanism for the former reaction is well understood , calculations were performed first for this reaction and used in conjunction with the available data to determine the relevant spectroscopic factors and bound state parameters .",
    "the resulting parameters were then used to constrain similar calculations for the @xmath1 reaction for a photon energy of 60 mev .",
    "the objective was to quantify the importance of the direct knockout ( dko ) mechanism to this process and hence to assess the extent of the contributions due to meson exchange current effects .",
    "the study revealed the surprising result that the constrained dko calculations fell considerably below the data in most cases .",
    "the authors report an average value of 5.8 for the ratio between data and calculations .",
    "the above results led ireland and van der steenhoven to explore possible contributions from meson exchange currents to the @xmath1 reaction in a simple model . using seigert s theorem they estimated these contributions in the plane wave limit where they could determine a factor given by the ratio of the full cross section to the dko cross section . when this factor was applied to the distorted wave dko calculations , the agreement with data showed considerable improvement .",
    "the authors then concluded that meson exchange current contributions to @xmath1 reactions , in this energy region , must be significant .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to report on similar comparative calculations carried out within a relativistic mean field approach .",
    "we have recently carried out relativistic distorted wave calculations for the dko contributions to @xmath1 reactions @xcite .",
    "there have also been several similar calculations for the @xmath0 reaction @xcite . moreover , recent studies by hedayati - poor _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite as well as other authors @xcite have concentrated on the question of the differences between relativistic and non - relativistic calculations for these two closely related reactions . in particular , the investigations reported in @xcite have pointed to the existence of subtle medium modifications to the interaction hamiltonians in the relativistic approach , which are absent in the corresponding non - relativistic treatment .",
    "this , in addition to the fact that the non - relativistic calculations referred to above require such large meson exchange contributions , suggests that a reanalysis in the relativistic framework is advisable . with the strong medium effects alluded to above",
    ", it is possible that the role of meson exchange currents could be strongly modified .",
    "we carry out a comparison between the two reactions mentioned above along similar lines to those used by ireland and van der steenhoven .",
    "relativistic calculations are carried out for @xmath0 reactions on a number of nuclei .",
    "the spectroscopic factors determined from comparison with the data are used to make predictions for @xmath1 reactions on the same nuclei .",
    "these predictions are compared directly to the cross section data .",
    "we outline the relativistic calculations for quasifree electron scattering and the direct knockout contribution to the @xmath1 reaction in section [ rel_obs ] .",
    "we then provide discussion of the specific ingredients of the models and results of the calculations for the two reactions in section [ disc ] .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ concl ] .",
    "the relativistic calculation of the amplitude in the one photon exchange model for the @xmath0 process is outlined in reference @xcite .",
    "the main results are given briefly here with some change of notation in order to highlight the similarities between the two reactions considered here .",
    "we do not include the coulomb distortion in the leptonic part of the amplitude .",
    "this will only be important for heavy nuclei @xcite which will not be considered in the present paper .",
    "the relativistic expression for the differential cross section leading to a specific final state of the residual nucleus can be written as @xmath2 }      \\frac { c } { v_{rel } } \\frac{1}{r }    \\nonumber     \\\\   & & \\times { \\frac { { \\cal s}_{j_i j_f } ( j_b ) } { 2j_b + 1 } }      \\sum _ { \\mu m_b \\nu_{f } \\nu_{i } }      { \\left| e_{\\nu_{f } \\nu_{i}}^{\\alpha }               n_{\\alpha}^{\\mu m_b } \\right| } ^2 ,    \\label{cross}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the spin projections of the incoming and outgoing electrons respectively , while @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the spin projections of the bound and continuum protons .",
    "the 4-momenta of the initial and final electrons are @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , while the final proton 4-momentum is @xmath9 .",
    "the 4-momentum of the exchanged photon is @xmath10 and is calculated as the difference between the initial and final electron 4-momenta @xmath11 .",
    "the 4-momentum of the recoil nucleus is @xmath12 and the initial 4-momentum of the struck proton is denoted @xmath13 , which is often called the missing momentum .",
    "the recoil factor @xmath14 , was not included in reference @xcite but we do include it here for completeness .",
    "@xmath14 is given in any frame by @xcite @xmath15 the function @xmath16 is @xmath17 where the wave functions of the continuum and bound nucleons , denoted @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , are solutions of the dirac equation containing appropriate potentials @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 , operating on the nucleon spinors is given in eq .",
    "( 2.8 ) of reference @xcite and the four - vector which comes from the electron vertex @xmath22 , is given in eq .",
    "( 2.9 ) of that same reference .",
    "the distorted momentum distribution ( referred to as ` reduced cross section ' by ireland and van der steenhoven in reference @xcite ) is obtained from the cross section given above through division by a kinematic factor and the cross section for the elementary @xmath23 process .",
    "we write @xcite : @xmath24 in the figures and the following discussion we refer to this simply as the momentum distribution .",
    "the space - like portion of the missing 4-momentum , in the impulse approximation , is the negative of the recoil nucleus 3-momentum in the lab frame @xmath25 .",
    "the free cross section , @xmath26 , is that which de forest denotes @xmath27 @xcite and is evaluated using the kinematics of the quasifree process with his prescription for the energy of the bound nucleon , @xmath28^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this prescription is used only in calculating the free cross section @xmath27 which divides our calculated cross section in eq .",
    "( [ mom_dist ] ) since @xmath27 divides the experimentally measured cross sections to obtain the momentum distributions which are presented as experimental data , see for example @xcite . for the distorted wave calculations of the cross section given in eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) we use a slightly different prescription for the missing energy , namely , @xmath29^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath30 is the energy required to remove the bound nucleon from the target nucleus . thus the bound proton is off - shell due to the modification of its mass by the separation energy .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath1 reaction in which the residual nucleus is left in a definite final state can be written as @xcite @xmath31 where for the direct knockout contribution , the function @xmath32 is the nuclear matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ nuc_mat ] ) .",
    "the 4-vector @xmath33 is the photon polarization vector with two polarization states @xmath34 .",
    "the recoil factor @xmath14 , has exactly the same form as that of eq .",
    "( [ recoil_fact ] ) but the kinematics are now those of the @xmath1 reaction .    in the comparison with experimental data it is not necessary to define a common function for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions .",
    "ireland and van der steenhoven presented their results in terms of common reduced cross sections in reference @xcite .",
    "the appeal of this procedure stems from the fact that the non - relativistic amplitudes for the two reactions reduce , in the plane wave limit , to simpler forms that depend on the momentum wave function of the struck nucleon .",
    "the relativistic amplitudes , however , do not lend themselves to a similar simplification .",
    "the important point in this regard , is that the two reactions probe complementary momentum regions of the nuclear wave function : the @xmath0 reaction for low momenta , and the @xmath1 reaction for higher momenta . in that sense",
    "it is extremely interesting to carry out a joint analysis of the two processes .",
    "this however does not restrict the way in which the individual data for each reaction is presented .",
    "thus in the next section we compare our calculations for @xmath0 with data for the momentum distribution because that is the way the data are usually presented .",
    "note that we are simply dividing our calculated differential cross section by the same factor by which the experimental differential cross section has been divided so the representation is irrelevant .",
    "we then compare the calculated and experimental cross sections for the @xmath1 reaction and check whether the predicted relativistic results are in better agreement than those obtained non - relativistically .",
    "we begin our discussion with the elements common to calculations of the two reactions .",
    "the bound state protons are described by solutions of a dirac equation containing the relativistic hartree potentials of horowitz and serot @xcite .",
    "these potentials , obtained through self - consistent calculations , usually underbind the protons in the states we consider by 1 - 3 @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 radii , however , are in reasonable agreement with those found by ireland and van der steenhoven @xcite as well as values obtained by other authors @xcite .",
    "the continuum proton in the final state is described by solutions of a dirac equation containing complex phenomenological optical potentials obtained from fits to proton elastic scattering data @xcite .",
    "there are several sets of potentials available , some of which are energy dependent ( e - dep ) and constructed from a fit to data for a specific nucleus , such as @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , in the proton kinetic energy range of @xmath40 25 @xmath35 to 1 @xmath41 .",
    "other potentials are parameterized in terms of target mass as well as proton energy ( e+a - dep ) and can be used to generate potentials for which no proton elastic scattering data exist .",

    "1 to 5 . in all cases",
    "the shape of the data is well described by our calculations indicating that the hartree wave functions are providing a reasonable description of the bound proton in the range of missing momenta considered .",

    "_ @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one important feature of the present analysis is the difference in spectroscopic factors obtained from calculations involving the different relativistic potentials .",
    "this is a measure of our uncertainty in the knowledge of the continuum proton wave function .",
    "we see differences of up to fifteen percent between the spectroscopic factors obtained using the e dependent potentials from those obtained using the e and a dependent potentials .",
    "we find similar differences when we use different bound state potentials with the e dependent optical potentials",
    ". even though there are differences in the extracted spectroscopic factors arising from sensitivity to the input ingredients of the model , the resulting fits to the @xmath0 data are all of similar quality .",
    "these uncertainties should be kept in mind when drawing conclusions concerning the magnitude of the dko contribution to @xmath1 reactions .",
    "relativistic calculations of the direct knockout contribution to @xmath1 reactions are carried out using the same relativistic hartree potentials and distorting potentials used in the electron scattering calculations , as well as the same relativistic spectroscopic factors ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we stress that there are no parameters left to adjust when comparing the results of the @xmath1 calculations to the data .",
    "the resulting cross sections can be regarded as relativistic predictions for the knockout contribution to the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "the results are shown in parts ( b ) of figs . 1 - 5 .",
    "the solid curves in all figures show the results of calculations for the reactions using the hartree binding potentials and _ ` fit 1 ' _ of the e and a dependent optical potentials discussed earlier . the dashed curves in figs . 2 and 3 use e dependent optical potentials along with hartree binding , while the dotted curves result from utilizing a woods - saxon binding potential .",
    "the curves of fig .",
    "5 result from using three different e and a dependent potentials .    in order to emphasize the complementary momentum regions explored by the two reactions considered we have included an insert in fig .",
    "1(b ) showing the missing momentum as a function of the proton lab angle for the @xmath1 reaction with a @xmath37 target .",
    "note that the the lowest missing momentum available in the @xmath1 reaction is near the maximum of the missing momenta for which data are shown for the @xmath54 reaction . in moving to larger nuclei with the same incident photon energy in the lab",
    "the missing momentum simply scales upward slightly .",
    "in comparing our relativistic calculations with the @xmath1 data it is striking that our calculations lie slightly above the data in two cases ( for the @xmath37 and @xmath38 targets shown in figs . 1 and 3 ) , and below in two cases ( for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 targets shown in figs . 2 and 4 )",
    ". in the fifth case",
    "in which the target is @xmath51 the calculations lie within the error bars of the data .",
    "this is contrary to the results of the non - relativistic analyses of ireland and van der steenhoven who found that dko calculations for @xmath1 reactions lie consistently below the data ; they reported an average factor of 5.8 for light nuclei @xcite .",
    "the largest differences between data and calculations occur for the lightest targets in both the non - relativistic and relativistic analyses .",
    "however the results of our relativistic calculations lie much closer to the data than the corresponding non - relativistic results for these light nuclei .    at this point",
    "it may be useful to comment on some aspects of the potential sensitivities in the present calculations .",
    "the hartree potentials result in a binding energy that is slightly smaller than the experimental value .",
    "alternate calculations for @xmath38 were performed using woods - saxon binding potentials , which reproduce the experimental binding energy and also provide an @xmath36 radius for the bound state that is within one percent of that found from the hartree potentials .",
    "we find little sensitivity to the results between the two potentials for the @xmath0 reaction ( see part ( a ) of figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this is because the momentum space wave functions for the bound states are very similar in the low momentum region explored by the @xmath0 reaction and only begin to show differences in the higher momentum region available via the @xmath1 reaction",
    ". figures 2(b ) and 3(b ) show that this is indeed the case , with a range of difference in the neighborhood of @xmath55 .",
    "we have also done calculations in which the depth of the dirac - hartree scalar potential is varied in order to reproduce the experimental binding energy .",
    "this requires a change in depth of the potential of less than @xmath56 but can yield a change in the @xmath1 cross section of up to @xmath55 .",
    "previously we pointed out some sensitivity to changes in the global optical potentials leading to different values of spectroscopic factors determined from @xmath0 data .",
    "we have done calculations for the @xmath37 and @xmath51 targets using the three available e and a dependent fits @xcite , and results are shown for the @xmath51 target in fig .",
    "5 . for the @xmath0 reaction the results change by less than five percent amongst the three potentials . the @xmath1 reaction shows slightly more sensitivity particularly for angles larger than @xmath57 , where the momentum transfer is large . however , there are no striking differences in shape or magnitude due to changes in the optical potentials .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath37 .",
    "it is evident from the above discussion that relativistic calculations for @xmath1 reactions do show some sensitivity to changes in the ingredients , and an estimate of these sensitivities combined leads to a possible variation in the magnitude of the cross sections by up to a factor of two , along with some variation in shape .",
    "it has also been noted by harty _",
    ". _ @xcite that there are unexplained inconsistencies within the set of experimental @xmath1 data leading to differences of factors of up to two between differential cross sections at the same angle and photon energy while the systematic errors are quoted as @xmath58 to @xmath59 . within these uncertainties",
    "our relativistic calculations are much closer to the @xmath1 data than the non - relativistic calculations of ireland and van der steenhoven .",
    "in this paper we have presented a comparative study of @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions for several nuclei .",
    "the objective is to make a quantitative assessment of the contribution from the direct knockout mechanism to the @xmath1 reactions in the relativistic approach and to compare this with the non - relativistic results of ireland and van der steenhoven .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction was used to fix the spectroscopic factors which were subsequently used to make predictions for the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "in the course of our study we have looked at the dependence of the results , for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions , on the type of bound state used and on the optical potentials describing the final state interactions of the outgoing proton .",
    "we find little sensitivity to the choice of binding potential in the @xmath0 reaction ; this is largely due to the low missing momenta covered by the present experimental data .",
    "the @xmath1 reaction explores a higher range of missing momenta , and we find slightly more sensitivity to the choice of binding and optical potentials .",
    "although the optical potentials we use are the best currently available there is clearly room for improvement in their precise specification",
    ". note however that we find less variation amongst the potentials used here , as measured by the spectroscopic factor extracted via the @xmath0 reaction , than found in earlier calculations @xcite .    with the above comments in mind",
    ", our relativistic analysis shows that the dko contribution lies much closer to the data , compared to the non - relativistic calculations of ireland and van der steenhoven , who have found that the dko calculations lie consistently below the data by an average factor of 5.8 .",
    "the factors required to bring our calculations to the data are consistently less than 2 .",
    "it should be noted that our present conclusions are in agreement with the findings of ryckebusch et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also bobeldijk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) who have done non - relativistic rpa calculations of meson exchange contributions to @xmath1 reactions .",
    "they have found that meson exchange is not the dominant contributor for the @xmath1 reaction leading to the ground state of the residual nucleus , while it can modify the dko cross section by up to a factor of two when the residual nucleus is excited to some low lying states .",
    "we conclude that the direct knockout contributions to the @xmath1 reaction are much closer to the data than is indicated in the non - relativistic calculations of ireland and van der steenhoven .",
    "this implies that meson exchange currents may not play as dominant a role in our relativistic calculations , although they may certainly contribute significantly in obtaining the correct shape and magnitude of the cross section . in order to fully understand the role of the various competing mechanisms ,",
    "it is desirable in this regard to carry out complete relativistic calculations , including meson exchange current corrections , and to compare the results with the data over a wide range of photon energies .",
    "we would like to thank l. lapiks and g. van der steenhoven for providing tables of the data used in the present paper .",
    "we are grateful to m. hedayatipoor for help in checking the numerical calculations and for useful discussions .",
    "two of us ( jij and hss ) would like to thank the institute for nuclear theory at the university of washington for their hospitality during the completion of this work .",
