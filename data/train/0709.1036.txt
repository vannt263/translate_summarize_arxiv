    "shell model calculations , carried out within a model space in which the nucleons are restricted to occupy a few orbits are unable to reproduce the measured static moments or transition strengths without scaling factors .",
    "inadequacies in the shell model wavefunctions are revealed by the need to scale the matrix elements of the one - body operators by effective charges to match the experimental data .",
    "however , the introduction of effective charges may bring the calculated transition strengths which are defined at the photon point , as well as , the form factors at the first maximum , closer to the measured values , but the non - zero momentum transfer ( @xmath4 ) values might deviate appreciably from the measured values @xcite .",
