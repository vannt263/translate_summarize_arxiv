    "the combined maxima-1 @xcite , boomerang @xcite , dasi @xcite and cobe / dmr cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations @xcite imply that the universe is flat @xcite and that most of the matter in the universe is dark @xcite , i.e. exotic .",
    "these results have been confirmed and improved by the recent wmap @xcite and planck @xcite data . combining the data of these quite precise measurements one finds : @xmath5 ( the more recent planck data yield a slightly different combination @xmath6 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that both the wmap and the plank observations yield essentially the same value of @xmath7 , but they differ in the value of @xmath8 , namely @xmath9 ( wmap ) and @xmath10 ( planck ) .",
    "since any  invisible \" non exotic component can not possibly exceed @xmath11 of the above @xmath12  @xcite , exotic ( non baryonic ) matter is required and there is room for cold dark matter candidates or wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) . even though there exists firm indirect evidence for a halo of dark matter in galaxies from the observed rotational curves , see e.g. the review @xcite , it is essential to directly detect such matter in order to unravel the nature of the constituents of dark matter . at present there",
    "exist many such candidates : the lsp ( lightest supersymmetric particle ) @xcite , technibaryon @xcite , mirror matter@xcite , kaluza - klein models with universal extra dimensions@xcite etc .",
    "additional theoretical tools are the structure of the nucleus , see e.g. @xcite , and the nuclear matrix elements @xcite .    in most calculations the wimp is supposed to be the neutralino or lsp ( lightest supersymmetric particle ) , which is assumed to be primarily a gaugino , usually a bino . models which predict a substantial fraction of higgsino lead to a relatively large spin induced cross section due to the z - exchange .",
    "such models tend to violate the lsp relic abundance constraint and are not favored .",
    "some claims have recently been made , however , to the effect that the wmap relic abundance constraint can be satisfied in the hyperbolic branch of the allowed susy parameter space , even though the neutralino is then primarily a higgsino @xcite .",
    "we will not restrict ourselves to supersymmetry and we will adopt the optimistic view that the detection rates due to the spin may be large enough to be exploited by the experiments , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "such a view is further encouraged by the fact that , unlike the scalar interaction , the axial current allows one to populate excited nuclear states , provided that their energies are sufficiently low so that they are accessible by the low energy lsp , a prospect proposed long time ago @xcite and considered in some detail by ejiri and collaborators @xcite .    for a maxwell - boltzmann (",
    "m - b ) velocity distribution the average kinetic energy of the wimp is : t50   [ kinen ] so for sufficiently heavy wimps the average energy may be adequate @xcite to allow scattering to low lying excited states of of certain targets , e.g. of @xmath13kev for the @xmath14 excited state of @xmath0i , the 39.6 kev for the first excited @xmath15 of @xmath1xe , the 35.48 kev for the first excited @xmath16 state of @xmath17te and the 9.4 kev for the first excited @xmath14 state of @xmath2kr .",
    "the first requirement is to have a large elementary nucleon cross section . in most models one can have both the scalar and spin induced cross section . in the case of the standard recoil experiments the coherent cross section",
    "is expected to dominate over the spin cross section especially for large @xmath18 , unless the spin induced amplitude is very large at the quark level .",
    "this is possible in some models like supersymmetry in the co - annihilation region @xcite , where the ratio of the spin to coherent nucleon cross section , depending on @xmath19 and the wimp mass , which is in the range 200 - 500 gev , can be as large as @xmath20 . in a region of the model space",
    "the ratio of the elastic spin cross section to the coherent can be as large as 10@xmath21 .",
    "more recent calculations in the supersymmetric @xmath22 model @xcite , also in the co - annihilation region , predict large spin to coherent cross section ratio , of the order of @xmath23 and a wimp mass of about 850 gev",
    ". models of exotic wimps , like majorana particles with spin 3/2 @xcite , also can lead to large nucleon spin cross sections , which satisfy the relic abundance constrain .",
    "these large nucleon cross sections may also allow inelastic scattering to the excited states with observable rates .",
    "in fact we expect that the branching ratio to the excited state will be enhanced in the presence of non zero energy threshold , since only the total rate to the ground state transition will be affected and reduced , while this will have a negligible effect on the rate due to the inelastic scattering .",
    "the analysis is simplified if , as expected from particle models as well as the structure of the nucleon , the isovector nucleon cross section is dominant .",
    "the spin dependent wimp - nucleus cross section is typically expressed in terms of the wimp - nucleon cross section , which contains the elementary particle parameters entering the problem at the quark level . for our purposes",
    "it is adequate to have at the quark level two parameters , one isoscalar @xmath24 and one isovector @xmath25 . in going to the nucleon level",
    "one must transform these two amplitudes by suitable renormalization factors given in terms of the quantities @xmath26 prescribed by ellis @xcite , namely @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 in other words the isovector component is renormalized as is expected for the axial current , while the isoscalar component is suppressed , consistent with the emc effect , i.e. the fact that only a tiny fraction of the spin of the nucleon is coming from the spin of the quarks .",
    "thus in general , barring very unusual circumstances at the quark level , the isovector component is expected to be dominant .",
    "it is for this reason that we started our discussion in the isospin basis . from these amplitudes",
    "one is able to calculate the isoscalar and isovector nucleon cross section .",
    "after that , within the context of a nuclear model , one can obtain the nuclear matrix element : |me|^2 = a_1 ^ 2 s_11(u)+a_1 a_0 s_01(u ) + a^2_0s_00(u ) , where @xmath31 are the spin structure functions , which depend on the momentum transferred to the nucleus .",
    "it is useful to define the structure functions @xmath32 with @xmath33 the isovector and isoscalar static spin matrix elements .",
    "then the functions @xmath34 take the value unity at momentum transfer zero .",
    "furthermore these new structure functions are approximately the same @xcite . then to a good approximation @xmath35 thus , leaving aside the factor @xmath36 , which will be taken care of explicitly in the expression for the event rate ( see below ) , the nuclear static spin cross section becomes _",
    "[ eq : nosf ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the elementary nucleon isoscalar and isovector cross sections . instead of",
    "these two one could have written an equivalent expression in terms of the proton and neutron elementary cross sections @xcite @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "+ the above expressions look complicated . in most models , however , e.g. in the case the wimp is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , one encounters @xmath41 exchange and @xmath42 coupling are purely isovector .",
    "the same is true in models involving heavy neutrinos as wimps , e.g. kaluza klein theories in models with universal extra dimensions @xcite . in the latter case it is possible to have both an isoscalar and isovector component if the wimp happens to be a vector boson .",
    "only isovector amplitudes are predicted also in the case of exotic spin 3/2 particles @xcite .",
    "since the isoscalar nucleon cross section is expected to be negligible , the above expression reduces to _ a^= .",
    "[ eq : nosf0 ]    regarding the spin nucleon cross sections at this point there exist some experimental limits , namely for @xmath1xe and @xmath43xe @xcite and @xmath44f @xcite .",
    "the first group extracts a limit on the neutron cross section of @xmath45@xmath46pb , while from the latter the limit @xmath47@xmath48pb .",
    "these limits were based on nuclear physics considerations , namely selecting the predominant nuclear spin matrix elements .",
    "thus they can not exclude the presence of the other elementary nucleon cross section . on the other hand ,",
    "if the elementary amplitude is purely isovector , these limits would imply @xmath49pb .",
    "we should mention in passing that the nuclear matrix elements for @xmath44f are expected to be much more reliable @xcite .",
    "actually this problem will remain open until all the three nucleon cross sections ( scalar , proton spin and neutron spin ) can be determined along the lines previously suggested @xcite , after sufficient experimental information on at least three suitable targets becomes available . anyway in the present work we will not commit ourselves to any particular model , but for orientation purposes we will use the value @xcite of @xmath50@xmath51pb .",
    "a complete calculation of the relevant spin stucture should be done along the lines previously done for other targets @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite and more recently @xcite,@xcite in the the shell model framework .",
    "we will not concern ourselves with other simplified models , e.g schemes of deformed rotational nuclei @xcite .",
    "a summary of some nuclear me involved in elastic and inelastic scattering can be found elsewhere @xcite , @xcite . in principle",
    "one may have to go a step further in improving the structure functions , since it has recently been found that in the evaluation of the ground state ( gs ) spin structure functions some additional input is needed , namely :    * one has to consider the nucleon form factor @xcite,@xcite entering the isovector axial current : = , = - [ eq : gaff ] if we choose as a @xmath52-axis the direction of momentum we find : _ m= \\ { + l(1-)_m , m=0 + _ m , m=1 + .",
    "thus only the longitudinal component of the transition operator is modified by the inclusion of the nucleon form factor .",
    "thus , even at sufficiently high momentum transfers , only 1/3 of the differential rate will be affected .",
    "* one has to consider effects arising from possible exchange currents .",
    "+ such currents lead to effective 2-body contributions obtained in the context of chiral effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite .",
    "we will elaborate further on this point , however , since it has been shown that such effects are independent of the target nucleus @xcite .",
    "thus they can be adequately contained in a retardation factor of the isovector amplitude , which takes the value of about 0.8 .",
    "thus one can absorb such effects in the isovector nucleon spin cross section , which anyway in practice it may have to be extracted from experiment , once the spin induced rates have been observed .",
    "we expect such a treatment will also work in the structure functions involving transitions to excited states .",
    "to interpret the experimental data , shell - model calculations have been carried out in the 28 - 50 valence shell composed of the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 orbitals .",
    "the calculations have been performed with recently available effective interaction by brown and lisetskiy @xcite and shell model code nushellx @xcite .",

    "we will restrict ourselves in the isovector transition .",
    "this is reasonable , since as we have already mentioned the isoscalar is absent in most particle models and even if it appears at the quark level it is expected to be suppressed @xcite due to considerations related to the spin of the nucleon . in such a case the ratio becomes independent of the elementary nucleon cross section .",

    "it is instructive to start with a consideration of the branching ratio of the total rates , which for the reasons discussed above is going to be independent of the elementary nucleon cross section .",
    "since the elastic scattering event rate is reduced by the threshold effects , but the inelastic scattering is not affected by such effects , we expect the branching ratio to be increasing as the threshold energy is increasing .",

    "+   @xmath82gev +    from this figure we see that the maximum total rate for the inelastic transition is around a wimp mass of about 50 gev , while the location of the maximum for ground state transition is around 20 gev .",
    "on the other hand the excited state can not be populated in the case of wimps lighter than 4.6 gev , but the ground state can , albeit with small rate there .",
    "we also see that for a wimp mass of 20 gev the obtained rate is @xmath83 counts/(kg - y)@xmath84/(kg - d ) .",
    "this is just above the rate of @xmath85 counts/(kg - d ) reported previously @xcite .",
    "this is a little surprising because a larger spin @xmath86 with the value of @xmath87 was estimated in the earlier work . the larger rate obtained in the present work could be attributed to our use of an energy dependent structure function , or , most likely , to the supersymmetric model they used , which would have yielded a nucleon cross section smaller than the one used here .",
    "in this section , we discuss experimental aspects of sd wimp studies by measuring inelastic nuclear scattering .",

    "sd wimps may show fairly appreciable cross sections of inelastic spin excitations , as shown in previous sections .",
    "experimentally , inelastic nuclear excitations provide unique opportunities for studying sd wimps .",
    "inelastic excitations are studied in two ways : singles measurement of both the nuclear recoil energy @xmath88 and the decaying @xmath89-ray energy @xmath90 in one detector , and coincidence measurement of the nuclear recoil and the @xmath89-ray in two separate detectors .",

    "an overall picture can be obtained by a phenomenological approach based on the lindhard theory @xcite , which is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : quenchf ] . in the case of @xmath2kr , due to the low excitation energy , our conclusions about the inelastic transition",
    "are not affected much by the quenching factor . in the present work",
    "we will use a quenching factor of 0 0.08 .",

    "the main purpose of the research described in this article is to explore the feasibility of an experiment to search for cold dark matter via an inelastic excitation of a nuclear target .",
    "the isotope @xmath2kr was chosen for two reasons : first , it has a low energy m1 transition from the 7/2@xmath108 first excited state at 9.4-kev to the 9/2@xmath108 ground state ; second , in the liquid state it is a fairly good scintillation detector material .",
    "the disadvantage of this choice is that the natural abundance of @xmath2kr is only 11.5@xmath21 which will require isotopic enrichment .",
    "in addition any content of the ubiquitous radioactive isotope @xmath109kr will render a sensitive search ineffective .",
    "even the isotopic enrichment of kr gas from the usual sources will never be free enough from @xmath109kr to allow a sensitive experiment .",
    "fortunately , a recent discovery by other researchers can very probably be used to ameliorate this difficulty .",
    "first , we discuss the scintillation properties of liquid kr , and then possible new sources of low - radioactive kr gas .",
    "the scintillation and other physical properties of liquid kr has been well studied and published in the literature @xcite- @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by independent groups @xcite @xcite that the addition of a few percent by mass of xe enhances the fast component of scintillation of lkr by a factor of approximately 10 .",
    "considering the long lifetime of the 7/2@xmath108 to 9/2@xmath108 ground - state decay in @xmath2kr , the pulse shape distortion might be utilized to provide partial background rejection as discussed in another case @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this advantage would be minimal in the case that the background from @xmath109kr was not negligible . in the usual case ,",
    "sources of krypton and argon for industrial use are obtained by distillation of atmospheric air , which contains radioactive @xmath109kr ( 10.75y ) and @xmath110ar ( 269y ) .",
    "these contaminations are unacceptable for use in ultra - low background experiments .",
    "it is a well - known fact in the geology and geochemistry community that through petroleum exploration , very large deep underground accumulations of co@xmath111 have been discovered in the greater colorado plateau and in the southern rocky mountain region @xcite .",
    "recently the princeton - lead darkside collaboration has been successful in working with industry to extract ultra - low radioactive background argon from large volumes of co@xmath111 using a vacuum pressure swing absorption plant @xcite,@xcite . in the case of kr , this would be the input gas for the isotopic enrichment .",
    "these facts imply the possibility of a sensitive search for the cold dark matter excitation of @xmath2kr to the first excited state and the detection of the deexcitation 9.4-kev gamma ray .",
    "however , the extraction of the kr from the deep underground co@xmath111 , as well as the requirement of isotopic enrichment would be far more costly than the extraction of @xmath112ar , which has an isotopic abundance of 100@xmath21 .",
    "accordingly , a research and development study would have to be undertaken to determine the technical and cost feasibility of this experimental approach .",
    "however , of the 30 isotopes discussed by ellis , flores and lewin @xcite @xmath2kr is one of the few for which there are clear paths to building a large detector .",
    "si and sd wimps have extensively been studied , so far , by measuring elastic nuclear recoils .",
    "the elastic scattering of si wimps is coherent scatting , thus the cross section is enhanced by the factor @xmath113 with @xmath18 being the nuclear mass number . on the other hand",
    "the elastic cross section of sd wimps is , is in general , smaller by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude than that for si wimps because the spin induced rates do not depend on @xmath113 , i.e. they do not exhibit coherence .",
    "it may , however , compete with the coherent scattering in models in which the spin induced nucleon cross section is much larger than the one due to a scalar interaction .",
    "we have seen that there exist viable such particle models . in such cases",
    "the inelastic wimp - nucleus scattering becomes important .",
    "indeed the inelastic scattering via spin interaction provides a new opportunity for studying sd wimps .",
    "experimentally , observation of both the nuclear recoils and the @xmath89 ray following the excited state does lead to the large energy signal of the unquenched @xmath90 and the sharp rise of the energy spectrum at around @xmath90 . even though the sd inelastic cross section is smaller than the sd elastic one , the inelastic event rate is comparable with the elastic one , since the inelastic signal is well beyond the detector threshold energy , while the elastic signal is mostly cut off by the detector threshold .    in the present paper we discussed mainly the inelastic excitations of @xmath2kr .",
    "another possible isotope , in addition to the @xmath0i and @xmath1xe discussed previously @xcite , is the @xmath114ge , in high energy resolution ge detectors , and @xmath17te currently under study . in short , the present paper , in conjunction with the earlier calculations @xcite , indicates that the inelastic scatting opens a new powerful way to search for sd wimps .    *",
