    "( [ eq15b ] ) is rewritten for @xmath230 , it leads to an inconsistent result that @xmath228 is not minimal in the range of @xmath114 .",

    "multifractality is thus distinct from our log - stability .",
    "the underlying assumption for using the large deviation theory is that the intermittency is asymptotically determined in the course of the mean energy transfer to the smaller scales , i.e. , the energy cascade @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the energy is transferred locally and instantaneously to the larger scales as well as to the smaller scales @xcite .",
    "these scales interact with one another and should have settled into a self - similar state that is to be described by a stable distribution of @xmath29 .",

    "( [ eq16 ] ) , we have related the observed value of @xmath96 to the minimum width of the inertial range and thereby to the maximum mean efficiency of the energy dissipation .",
