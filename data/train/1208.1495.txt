    "blind quantum computing  @xcite is a secure delegated quantum computing , where a client ( alice ) , who does not have enough quantum technology , delegates her quantum computing to a server ( bob ) , who has a fully - fledged quantum computer , without leaking any information about her computation to bob .",
    "a blind quantum computing protocol for almost classical alice was first proposed by broadbent , fitzsimons , and kashefi  @xcite by using the measurement - based model due to raussendorf and briegel  @xcite . in their protocol",
    ", alice only needs a device which emits randomly rotated single - qubit states .",
    "later it was shown that weak coherent pulses , instead of single - photon states , are sufficient for blind quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that blind quantum computing can be verifiable  @xcite . here ,",
    "verifiable means that alice can test bob s computation  @xcite .",
    "the verifiability is an important requirement , since alice can not recalculate the result of the delegated computation by herself to check the correctness ( remember that she does not have any quantum computer ) , and therefore if there is no verification method , she might be palmed off with a wrong result by a fishy company who tries to sell a fake quantum computer  @xcite . the verifiable blind protocol was experimentally demonstrated with a photonic qubit system  @xcite .    0 in quantum cryptography , such as the quantum key distribution ,",
    "device independence  @xcite is one of the most important concepts .",
    "it roughly means that the devices used in the protocol do not need to be trusted .",
    "( for the precise definition , we note that there are several different definitions for the device independence , depending on implicit assumptions such as assuming quantum physics or no - signaling theory , or allowing multiple isolated devices or not , etc . )",
    "the device independence is a desirable property , since normally the user of the device is assumed to be technologically weak , and therefore the user can not verify the device by herself although most likely she has to buy the device from a third party , which is not necessarily trusted .",
    "can we achieve such a device independence in blind quantum computing ? for protocols where alice emits single - qubit states ( or weak coherent pulses )  @xcite , the device - independent security , i.e. , alice s privacy is protected without checking her device , is not guaranteed , since in order to guarantee the security alice has to check that her device generates the correct states .",
    "( for example , if her device emits more than two photons , bob can exploit the extra photon to learn alice s secret . or",
    "more generally , if alice s device is malicious and it emits the state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the state that is supposed to be generated if the device is honest , and @xmath2 is a state that contains alice s secret , then bob can learn alice s secret .",
    "alice has to verify that the generated state is not @xmath0 but @xmath1 . ) for the protocol where alice does measurements  @xcite , the device independent security is easily satisfied as is shown in ref .",
    "however , the protocol is not verifiable , and therefore it is not clear whether the verifiability and the device independence can be compatible with each other .",
    "recently , another type of blind quantum computing protocol was proposed in ref .  @xcite . in this protocol",
    ", alice needs only a device that can measure quantum states .",
    "one advantage of this protocol is that the security is device independent  @xcite , and is based on the no - signaling principle  @xcite , which is more fundamental than quantum physics .",
    "however , it has been an open problem whether the protocol can enjoy verification .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a verification protocol for the measurement - only blind quantum computing .",
    "we will propose two protocols .",
    "interestingly , our protocols are based on the combination of two different concepts from different fields : the no - signaling principle  @xcite from the foundation of physics and the topological quantum error correcting code  @xcite from a practical application in quantum information .",
    "the no - signaling principle means that a shared quantum ( or more general ) state can not be used to transmit information .",
    "it is one of the most central principles in physics , and known to be more fundamental than quantum physics ( i.e. , there is a theory which is more non - local than quantum physics but does not violate the no - signaling principle  @xcite ) .",
    "the topological quantum error correcting code is a specific type of the quantum error correcting code which cleverly uses the topological order of exotic quantum symmetry - breaking systems to globally encode logical states .",
    "the raussendorf - harrington - goyal state @xmath3 is the three - dimensional graph state with the elementary cell given in fig .",
    "[ di_fig3 ] ( a ) .",
    "defects in the graph state are created by @xmath4 measurements on @xmath3 as usual in the cluster measurement - based model .",
    "topological braidings of defect tubes can implement some clifford gates  @xcite .",
    "non - clifford gates , that are necessary for the universal quantum computation , are implemented by the magic state preparation and distillation  @xcite .",
    "a string of @xmath4 operators acting on the resource state , which has at least one open edge , is considered as an error , and its edge(s ) is detected by syndrome measurements of cubicles of @xmath5 operators ( fig .",
    "[ di_fig3 ] ( b ) ) . a string of @xmath4 operators on the resource states , which connects or surrounds defects ( fig",

    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "let us explain our first protocol .",
    "the basic idea of our protocol is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ di_fig1 ] : bob prepares the resource state , and alice performs measurements .        more precisely , our protocol runs as follows ( fig .",
    "[ di_fig2 ] ) .",
    "first , bob prepares a universal resource state , and sends each qubit of it to alice one by one ( fig .",
    "[ di_fig2 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "alice measures each qubit until she remotely creates the @xmath6-qubit state , @xmath7 , in bob s laboratory ( fig .",
    "[ di_fig2 ] ( b ) ) , where @xmath8 with @xmath9 is the byproduct of the measurement - based quantum computation  @xcite , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are pauli operators acting on @xmath12th qubit .",
    "the state @xmath13 is the @xmath6-qubit state , where @xmath14 is an @xmath15-qubit universal resource state of the measurement - based quantum computation encoded with a quantum error - correcting code of the code distance @xmath16 .",
    "( the size of @xmath14 and the number of traps are optimal , since if there are too many traps , the efficiency of the computation becomes small , whereas if there are too few traps , the probability of detecting malicious bob becomes small . ) for example , @xmath14 can be the @xmath15-qubit raussendorf - harrington - goyal state  @xcite with sufficiently many magic states being already distilled .",
    "( the raussendorf - harrington - goyal state is the resource state of the topological measurement - based quantum computing  @xcite . in stead of the rhg state",
    ", any other quantum error correcting code can be utilized .",
    "therefore , we can also assume that @xmath14 is a normal resource state of the measurement - based quantum computation encoded with a quantum error - correcting code . )",
    "we define @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is an @xmath6-qubit permutation , which keeps the order of qubits in @xmath14 .",
    "this permutation is randomly chosen by alice and kept secret to bob .",
    ", @xmath18 is a @xmath6-qubit permutation , and @xmath14 is a universal resource state . , scaledwidth=30.0% ]    throughout this paper , we assume that there is no communication channel from alice to bob",
    ". then , due to the no - signaling principle , bob can not learn anything about @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "if bob can learn something about @xmath18 , alice can transmit some message to bob by encoding her message into @xmath18 , which contradicts to the no - signaling principle .",
    "bob sends each qubit of @xmath7 to alice one by one , and alice does the measurement - based quantum computation on @xmath7 with correcting @xmath19 ( fig .  [ di_fig2 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "this means that before measuring @xmath12th qubit of @xmath7 she applies @xmath20 on @xmath12th qubit , where @xmath20 is the restriction of @xmath21 on @xmath12th qubit .",
    "for example , @xmath22 .",
    "qubits belonging to @xmath14 are used to implement the alice s desired quantum computation .",
    "states @xmath23 and @xmath24 are used as  traps \"  @xcite . in other words , she measures @xmath4 on @xmath23 and @xmath5 on @xmath24 , and if she obtains the minus result ( i.e. , @xmath25 or @xmath26 state ) , she aborts the protocol .",
    "if results are plus for all traps , she accepts the result of the measurement - based quantum computation on @xmath14 .",
    "now we show that if all measurements on traps show the correct results , the probability that a logical state of alice s computation is changed is exponentially small .",
    "in other words , the probability that alice is fooled by bob is exponentially small .",
    "hence , our protocol is verifiable .",
    "since bob might be dishonest , he might deviate from the above procedure .",
    "his general attack is a creation of a different state @xmath27 instead of @xmath7 .",
    "if he is honest , @xmath28 .",
    "if he is not honest , @xmath27 can be any state .",
    "however , for any @xmath6-qubit state @xmath27 , there exists a completely - positive - trace - preserving ( cptp ) map which satisfies @xmath29 where @xmath30 , is a kraus operator of the cptp map , and @xmath31 is a complex number ( see appendix  [ app : cptp ] ) . since @xmath32 is a povm , @xmath33 we obtain @xmath34 .",
    "bob does not know @xmath35 . therefore , from bob s view point , the state is averaged over all @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 here , we have used the following equations  @xcite @xmath39 for any @xmath27 and @xmath40 .",
    "the second equation is easy to show . for a proof of eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) , see appendix  [ app : diagonalize ] .",
    "equation ( [ attack ] ) shows that we can assume that bob s attack is the",
    " random pauli \" attack , i.e. , bob randomly applies pauli operators on each qubit .",
    "bob s attacks after creating @xmath27 can also be included in the preparation of @xmath27 .",
    "this is understood as follows .",
    "let us assume that , after creating @xmath27 , bob sends a subsystem @xmath41 of @xmath27 to alice , and then alice measures all particles of @xmath41 .",
    "after this alice s measurement , bob might apply an operation on another subsystem @xmath42 of @xmath27 which has not been sent to alice . however , bob can not know alice s measurement angles and results on @xmath41 due to the no - signaling principle , and therefore bob s operation on @xmath42 is independent of alice s measurements on @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , bob s operation on @xmath42 commutes with alice s measurements on @xmath41 .",
    "hence we can consider as if bob applied such an operation on @xmath42 immediately after he preparing @xmath27 .    in short",
    ", we can assume that bob s attack is a random pauli attack on the correct state @xmath43 as is shown in eq .",
    "( [ attack ] ) . hence let us focus on @xmath44 . for many quantum error correcting code ( such as the topological one  @xcite ) ,",
    "if the weight @xmath45 of @xmath46 is less than a certain integer @xmath16 ( the code distance ) , then such an error is detected or does not change logical states  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the topological code , @xmath16 is determined by the defect thickness and distance between defects  @xcite . here",
    ", the weight @xmath45 of @xmath46 means the number of nontrivial operators in @xmath46 .",
    "( for example , the weight of @xmath47 is 3 . ) therefore , in order for @xmath46 to change a logical state of the computation , @xmath45 must be larger than @xmath16 .",
    "( to understand it , let us consider a simple example . if we encode the logical 0 as @xmath48 and the logical 1 as @xmath49",
    ", we must flip more than two qubits to change the logical state .",
    "a single bit flip is detected and corrected when the majority vote is done . )",
    "alice randomly chooses a permutation @xmath18 . in this case , the probability of @xmath50 not changing any trap is at most @xmath51 .",
    "( for a calculation , see appendix  [ app : prob ] ) .",
    "therefore , the probability that the logical state is changed and no trap is flipped is at most @xmath52 where we have used the fact @xmath53 and @xmath54 . here",
    ", we have said  at most \" , since the above sum includes the contribution from @xmath46 which has a weight larger than @xmath16 but does not contain any logical error . in this way",
    ", we have shown that the probability that alice is fooled by bob is exponentially small ( @xmath16 can be sufficiently large by concatenating the code ) .",
    "as we have seen , no communication from alice to bob is required for the verification . therefore ,",
    "whatever alice s measurement device does , bob can not learn alice s computational information because of the no - signaling principle .",
    "in other words , the security of the protocol is device - independent .",
    "let us explain our second protocol , which uses the property of the topological code , and does not use any trap .",
    "alice randomly chooses @xmath55 , and defines the @xmath6-qubit operator @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the hadamard operator .",
    "note that @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "next , alice defines the @xmath6-qubit state @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the @xmath6-qubit raussendorf - harrington - goyal state  @xcite with sufficient number of magic states being already distilled  @xcite .",
    "bob prepares a universal resource state , and sends each qubit of it to alice one by one .",
    "alice does measurements and creates @xmath64 in bob s laboratory , where @xmath19 is the byproduct of the measurement - based quantum computation . due to the no - signaling principle",
    ", bob can not learn @xmath65 .",
    "bob sends each qubit of @xmath64 to alice one by one , and alice does her topological measurement - based quantum computation with correcting @xmath66 . if alice detects any error , she aborts the protocol .    again , because of eq .",
    "( [ attack ] ) , we can assume that bob s attack is a random pauli attack .",
    "therefore let us focus on @xmath67 .",
    "in order for @xmath46 to change a logical state without being detected by syndrome measurements , @xmath46 must contain at least one string @xmath68 of operators which connects or surrounds defects ( fig .",
    "[ di_fig3 ] ( c ) )  @xcite .",
    "since alice randomly chooses @xmath65 , the probability that all operators in @xmath69 become @xmath4 or @xmath70 operators is at most @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the weight of @xmath68 .",
    "note that @xmath73 because it connects or surrounds defects .",
    "hence , the probability that the logical state is changed and alice does not detect any error is at most @xmath74 in short , our second protocol is also verifiable .",
    "again , the device - independent security is guaranteed by the no - signaling principle .    0",
    "it would be valuable to see here the relation between our result and results about the device - independent quantum key distribution ( qkd ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was pointed out that if alice and bob use the same device many times , the qkd is not device - independent secure , since the malicious device can store the secret key in its memory , and can make it public by pretending it to be a legal classical message in the next round of qkd protocol .",
    "interestingly , in blind quantum computing , the device - independent security can be guaranteed even if alice use multiple devices that are communicating with each other due to the no - signaling principle .",
    "in particular , alice can use the same measurement device for generating traps and for doing the computation itself .",
    "however , if alice does not have any trusted random number generator , or uses the same device several times , the verifiability of blind quantum computing is no longer device - independent . in qkd ,",
    "several new results have been published recently that if trusted random number generators or isolated multiple devices are available , alice and bob do not need to check device for the secure qkd  @xcite .",
    "( hence device - independent in that sense . ) in a similar way , if we relax some strict requirements , we can show the device - independent verifiability .",
    "for example , if alice can use trusted random number generators and isolated multiple devices including a single trusted device , the device - independent verifiability is possible , which is an analogy of the result  @xcite that the trusted random number generator and a single secure qkd allow the multiple use of the same device .    0",
    "testing computation is also important problem and has a long history in computer science . in particular , testing quantum computing has attracting much attention recently .",
    "reichardt , unger , and vazirani  @xcite ( ruv ) showed that a  classical command of quantum systems \" is possible even for a completely classical client if she interacts with two quantum servers .",
    "however , in order to achieve the completely classical client , their scheme needs an artificial assumption that two quantum servers can not communicate with each other . on the other hand , in our protocols , there is no such assumption since the client interacts with only a single server like bfk protocol . in order to have a single server",
    ", we require the client to do polarization measurements of bulk photons with a threshold detector , but it is almost classical job , and in fact ubiquitous in today s laboratories .",
