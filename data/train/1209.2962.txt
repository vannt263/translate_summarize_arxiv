    "quantum information studies communication or computation schemes which allow more efficient solutions when considering the laws of quantum theory instead of those of classical physics . in this research field ,",
    "entanglement has proven to be a beneficial resource and many applications make use of maximally entangled states  @xcite . as these states are important for such applications , methods have been developed to create one maximally entangled state out of several copies of less entangled states using local operations and classical communication ( locc )  @xcite . this process is called entanglement distillation .",
    "entangled states that allow for the creation of a maximally entangled state by locc in at least one bipartition of the composite system are called distillable . states which are entangled but not distillable are called bound entangled  @xcite .",
    "+ bell inequalities are constraints on probabilities for local measurements , which are satisfied by local hidden variable theories  @xcite .",
    "however , they are not satisfied by quantum mechanics .",
    "entangled states that violate a bell inequality are called nonlocal . there",
    "exist ( mixed ) entangled local states , i.e. states which do not violate any bell inequality  @xcite .",
    "yet , it was shown that all entangled states , including bound entangled ones , violate a bell inequality when combined with another state which on its own can not violate the same bell inequality  @xcite .",
    "+ every distillable state may be transformed into a nonlocal state using only locc , but not every nonlocal state is distillable .",
    "this was found recently by giving an explicit example of a nonlocal bound entangled state  @xcite ( strengthening previous results  @xcite to fully bound entangled states , see below for the definition of fully bound entangled states ) . even though no pure entanglement can be distilled from bound entangled states they constitute an useful resource in quantum information protocols .",
    "these are entanglement activation  @xcite , enhancement of the teleportation power of some other state  @xcite , quantum steering  @xcite , quantum data hiding  @xcite and quantum key distribution  @xcite .",
    "the last two tasks are `` classical '' in the sense that they can be stated outside the framework of quantum theory . quantum theory",
    "can then enable advantages in comparison to how the tasks can be performed on the basis of classical laws .",
    "in this paper we consider another task of this type - communication complexity - for which we show that bound entangled states can provide advantage over all possible classical solutions .",
    "this task allows to quantify the advantage of the bound entangled states with respect to classical resources of shared ( classically ) correlated bit strings .",
    "communication complexity studies the amount of information that must be communicated between distant parties in order to calculate a function of arguments which are distributed among the parties  @xcite .",
    "we consider a similar question : if the parties are restricted to communicate only a given amount of information , what is the highest possible probability for them to estimate the value of the function correctly ? + it is well known , that nonlocal states can be useful in such a task  @xcite . here we give a surprisingly simple example illustrating the fact , that this includes even fully bound entangled states .",
    "we will make use of a generalization of the quantum communication complexity scheme introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to more than two bits input per party .",
    "consider the situtation where @xmath0 parties labelled @xmath1 to @xmath0 are spatially separated .",
    "let us assume an inequality of the form @xmath2 where the coefficients @xmath3 and the local hidden variable bound @xmath4 are real numbers and @xmath5 is the correlation function of a measurement for the choice of measurement setting @xmath6 by each party @xmath7 .",
    "the correlation function can be expressed as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the measurement result of observer @xmath7 .",
    "we call inequality  [ eq : bellineq ] a bell inequality , if it can be violated by a value @xmath10 using quantum mechanical expectation values .",
    "following the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite we introduce a quantum communication complexity problem associated with this bell inequality .",
    "each party @xmath7 receives one bit @xmath11 and @xmath12 bits @xmath13 unknown to all the other parties .",
    "the two possible values of @xmath14 occur with equal probability while the values of @xmath6 follow the probability distribution @xmath15 which is fixed beforehand and known to all parties .",
    "their common task is to output the value of the function @xmath16.\\ ] ] the parties will not evaluate the function correctly with certainty .",
    "the aim is to maximize the probability of successful evaluation .",
    "each party is allowed to broadcast a single bit of information to its fellow parties .",
    "it is required that all parties broadcast the bit simultaneously ( in this way the communicated bit of one party does not depend on the broadcasted bits of others , but only on the local input ) .",
    "afterwards one of the parties is asked to output the value of the function .",
    "we consider two different protocols . in the classical protocol the bit @xmath17 sent by party @xmath7 could be in general , any function of @xmath14 and @xmath6 .",
    "however it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ( analog to ref .",
    "@xcite ) that in the optimal classical protocol @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an appropriate chosen function @xmath20 and the best guess is given by @xmath21 intuitively one can understand this in the following way .",
    "opposite values of any @xmath14 lead to opposite values of the function @xmath22 . missing a single @xmath14",
    "would completely destroy the information about the result .",
    "therefore it is crucial to communicate @xmath14 in a way that allows to reconstruct the product of all the @xmath14 s . in the quantum protocol @xmath19",
    "is replaced by the measurement result @xmath23 .",
    "each party @xmath7 chooses one out of @xmath24 possible measurement settings according to the input @xmath6 and sends @xmath14 multiplied by the measurement result @xmath23 .",
    "the best guess is then again given by eq .",
    "[ eq : answerfunction ] .",
    "+ the probability of success of the protocol , i.e. the probability for @xmath25 to equal @xmath26 can be written as @xmath27\\ ] ] using the weighted scalar product @xmath28 inserting @xmath29 , @xmath22 and @xmath30 gives the probability of guessing correctly @xmath31 in the classical protocol and @xmath32 in the quantum case .",
    "we now come to the explicit example .",
    "we choose @xmath33 , so there are three separated parties .",
    "they share the state @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 it was introduced by t. vrtesi and n. brunner in ref .",
    "see the reference for an analytic expression for the amplitudes .",
    "it is constructed such that it is symmetric under permutations of the parties and invariant under partial transpose with respect to party @xmath39 .",
    "the last condition is sufficient for @xmath40 to be biseparable on the partition @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "together these conditions ensure that the state is separable along any biseparation .",
    "therefore it is fully nondistillable .",
    "here `` fully nondistillable '' refers to the fact that none of the three groupings @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 of subsystems to parties is distillable .",
    "vrtesi and brunner also found that @xmath40 can be used to violate the bell inequality @xmath44\\leq 3 , \\label{eq : originalbellineq}\\ ] ] which is listed under number 5 in ref .",
    "the symbol @xmath45 $ ] denotes the symmetrization of @xmath46 with respect to the three parties , e.g. @xmath47=a_1 b_2+a_1 c_2+a_2 b_1+a_2 c_1+b_1 c_2+b_2 c_1 $ ] .",
    "as @xmath40 is fully nondistillable and nonlocal it is fully bound entangled .",
    "+ we now use the method of homogenization described by y. wu and m. ukowski in ref .",
    "@xcite : by adding a constant @xmath48 to inequality ( [ eq : originalbellineq ] ) the bounds become symmetric",
    ". then we introduce new observables @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 which also take the values @xmath52 and @xmath1 . substituting the observables @xmath53 by @xmath54 , @xmath55 by @xmath56 and @xmath57 by @xmath58 and factoring out @xmath59 , one expands lower order correlation terms to full correlation terms .",
    "we arrive at the inequality @xmath60\\left.\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{a_0b_0c_0}\\mbox{sym}[}\\right| & \\leq 8 \\nonumber\\\\   \\leftrightarrow\\qquad&\\phantom{\\left| \\frac{1}{a_0b_0c_0}\\right.{}}| \\mbox{sym } [ 5 a_0 b_0 c_0+a_1 b_0 c_0 + a_1b_2c_0 -a_2b_2c_0&\\nonumber\\\\   & \\phantom{{}\\left| \\frac{1}{a_0b_0c_0 } \\mbox{sym } [ \\right.5 a_0 b_0 c_0{}}- a_1 b_1 c_1-a_2b_1c_1+a_2b_2c_2]| & \\leq 8,\\label{eq : newformbellineq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is expression h05 given in table i of ref .  @xcite .",
    "this inequality has the required form to link to the communication complexity problem described above . like in ref .",
    "@xcite we choose @xmath61 for the new observables it is sufficient to choose @xmath62 . with these observables",
    "we calculate the left - hand side of ( [ eq : newformbellineq ] ) using the quantum mechanical expectation values as @xmath63 this violation of the bell inequality ( [ eq : newformbellineq ] ) implies a quantum advantage in the quantum communication complexity task associated with it .",

    "the first factor of eq .",
    "[ eq : gfuerh05 ] gives the sign of the coefficient while the others define the probability distribution for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : q ] ) .",
    "the task for the three parties is to calculate the function @xmath71\\nonumber\\\\    & = & y_1 y_2 y_3 \\left\\ { 2 \\left[(\\delta_{x_1,x_2,x_3}+x_1+x_2+x_3 ) \\bmod 2\\right]-1\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is basically the parity of the sum of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath72 .",
    "as we chose @xmath62 a party @xmath7 performs no measurement if @xmath73 and simply sends @xmath14 . using equations (",
    "[ eq : pc ] ) and ( [ eq : pq ] ) we get @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this shows that albeit slightly , the parties still can increase the probability of success if they share the bound entangled state @xmath40 , as compared to any classical protocol .",
    "this is striking , especially if you remind yourself that the state @xmath40 is separable along any bipartition , i.e. it satisfies all bell inequalities across every bipartition .",
    "the presented task is a simple application associated with the bell inequality ( [ eq : originalbellineq ] ) the authors of ref .",
