    "entanglement @xcite is one of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum mechanics .",
    "its inherently non - classical nature caused much controversy in the early years of its discovery @xcite , and in more recent years many practical uses have been found for entanglement in the developing subject of quantum information science @xcite .",
    "this has led to a concerted effort to understand the nature of entanglement , and to create a consistent theory that allows us to both determine when an arbitrary mixed state is entangled , and to quantify the entanglement of that state . while the nature of bipartite pure state entanglement is well understood @xcite ,",
    "there is still much work to be done in the case of arbitrary mixed multipartite states ; indeed , we still do not have an operational criteria to determine whether an arbitrary multipartite mixed state is entangled .",
    "however , in @xcite , a necessary and sufficient condition for a bipartite state to be entangled was established using positive maps , and this was generalised to the multipartite case in @xcite .",
    "we will make use of the positive map formalism heavily in this paper .",
    "a good review can be found in @xcite .",
    "the _ reduction criterion _",
    "@xcite gives a necessary condition for a state to be separable ; states which violate this criterion are hence entangled , and it can also be shown that these states are 1-distillable . in this paper",
    "we will produce some further necessary criteria for states to be ( semi-)separable by introducing a new set of positive but not completely positive maps , and furthermore we will use the tripartite werner states discussed in @xcite to investigate their entanglement detecting properties . finally , we will also discuss what the violation of these criteria means in terms of distillation .",
    "the criteria described in this paper are related to the subsystem compatibility problem : _ given states of all proper subsystems of a multipartite system , what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for these subsystem states to be compatible with a single state of the whole system ? _ in @xcite , this problem is solved for a classical system of @xmath0 bits , and some of these conditions can be translated into necessary conditions for a system of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "we will show in this paper how our new set of positive maps can be used to derive some of these conditions in a more general setting .",
    "let @xmath1 be a hilbert space , and @xmath2 be the set of ( bounded ) operators on @xmath1 .",
    "the reduction map @xmath3 , which is defined by @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the identity matrix ) is a positive map : if @xmath6 has positive eigenvalues @xmath7",
    "@xmath8 then @xmath9 , and hence the eigenvalues of @xmath10 are @xmath11 @xmath12 , which are also positive .",
    "the map is not however completely positive : for instance , let @xmath13 , then @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 above is the identity map i.e. @xmath16 clearly has a negative eigenvalue . hence for a bipartite state @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 ) is a necessary condition for a quantum state to be separable .",
    "this is known as the _ reduction criterion_. any state violating this condition is not only entangled , but in fact is 1-distillable .",
    "this was originally proved in @xcite and shown in a more abstract fashion in @xcite .",
    "let us define the maps @xmath20 by @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 denotes the number of elements in the set @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the reduced density matrix of @xmath6 over the subsystems given in the set @xmath24 , padded out with identities in the other systems ( e.g. if @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , then @xmath28 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath29 it is from these maps that we will form our necessary criteria for separability .",
    "we first note a preliminary result :    @xmath30    _ proof _ by induction : trivially true for @xmath31 ; furthermore , assuming the result is true for the @xmath32 case ,",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36    this result immediately shows the sense in which we can think about these maps as generalising the reduction criterion .",
    "we now prove that these maps are positive , and furthermore they satisfy a further condition known as _",
    "@xmath37-decomposability_. we first recall the definition of schmidt number for density matrices @xcite : a bipartite density matrix @xmath6 has schmidt number @xmath38 if    1 .   for any decomposition @xmath39 ,",
    "at least one of the @xmath40 has schmidt rank ( number of non - zero coefficients in schmidt decomposition ) at least @xmath38 ; 2 .",
    "there exists a decomposition of @xmath6 with all vectors @xmath40 of schmidt rank no more than @xmath38 .",
    "a map @xmath3 is @xmath38-decomposable if we can write @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the transpose and @xmath43 is a completely positive map such that each @xmath44 has rank @xmath38 .    with these definitions , we are ready to state our main result :    @xmath45 is a positive map , and is @xmath37-decomposable .",
    "_ proof _ we make use of the jamiokowski correspondence @xcite : let @xmath46 and consider the operator @xmath47 defined by @xmath48 where @xmath49 a multiple of the projector onto the maximally entangled state on @xmath50 , and @xmath51 forms an orthonormal basis for @xmath52 .",
    "we number the @xmath37 systems as @xmath53 ( so that @xmath54 ) .",
    "then , using lemma 1 , @xmath55 let us now write the above as an n - fold tensor product , grouping together the hilbert spaces @xmath56 for each @xmath57 ( i.e. systems 1 and @xmath58 etc . ) .",
    "we can then write @xmath59 let us consider the partial transpose of this over the second system @xmath60 ( i.e. over systems @xmath61 ) . since @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the swap operator , we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 indicates partial transpose over the systems @xmath58 to @xmath37 .",
    "this is a positive operator , as @xmath63 has eigenvalues @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath67 has a schmidt rank 2 decomposition : defining @xmath68 , then @xmath69 hence @xmath70 is a schmidt rank 2 operator ( the operator is clearly not separable and hence can not have a schmidt rank 1 decomposition ) . due to the the tensor product structure of @xmath71 in ( [ witness ] )",
    ", it must have schmidt rank @xmath37 .",
    "it is possible to obtain @xmath45 from @xmath71 using the inversion formula @xcite @xmath72.\\ ] ] suppose @xmath73 , with @xmath74 having schmidt decomposition @xmath75 i.e. schmidt rank is @xmath0 . some elementary algebra and the above inversion formula allows us to obtain that @xmath76 , with @xmath77 , an operator of rank @xmath0 , where if @xmath78 , then @xmath79 .",
    "hence by linearity , for @xmath80 being positive and having schmidt rank @xmath38 , @xmath81 is @xmath38-decomposable .",
    "it follows that @xmath45 is a @xmath37-decomposable map .",
    "@xmath82    from these conditions we can obtain some of the necessary conditions mentioned briefly in the introduction to this paper . for odd @xmath0 , the coefficient of @xmath6 in the expression for @xmath83 is negative , and hence the expression @xmath84 is positive .",
    "furthermore , this expression is written only in terms of the reduced density matrices of all of the proper subsystems of an @xmath0-partite system .",
    "hence if the above expression is _ not _ positive , it follows that the given reduced density matrices are not compatible with an overall state @xmath6 .",
    "this generalises part of the necessary condition in @xcite , which is made for @xmath0-partite systems of qubits with @xmath0 odd , to the case of @xmath0-partite systems ( still for odd @xmath0 ) where each individual system has arbitrary ( finite ) dimension .",
    "we note that none of these maps are completely positive ; this is evident from the construction above .",
    "an example case by paul butterley . ] is @xmath85 for @xmath86 ( i.e. @xmath58 qubits ) , and @xmath87 defined by @xmath88 , with @xmath89 .",
    "then , using ( [ grm ] ) , @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 which has negative eigenvalues ( the subscripts label which systems each map acts on ) .",
    "we can hence think of each of these maps as providing necessary conditions for a density matrix to be separable : for a multipartite system with @xmath0 parts , and @xmath94 with @xmath95 , @xmath96 is a necessary condition for separability , where the subscript set denotes the systems that the map operates on .",
    "for example , for a tripartite state @xmath6 , we have that @xmath97 is a necessary condition for @xmath6 to have the semi - separable form @xmath98 .",
    "we note that if @xmath99 , then @xmath100 , which will also have negative eigenvalues .",
    "one issue we are concerned with is the entanglement detecting power of these maps , especially in relation to the reduction criterion .",
    "the important result we will show here is that _ there are states detected by @xmath101 that are not detected by @xmath102 , and vice versa_. to do this we utilise the tripartite werner states that are introduced in @xcite ( we choose these states in particular as the entangled two - party werner states are not detected by the reduction criterion @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider the hilbert space @xmath103 , and let us define the permutation operators @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "then ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) states that the tripartite werner states are given by @xmath106 .",
    "we can rewrite these states using the following linear combinations , which we obtain from the representation theory of the group @xmath107 : @xmath108 we note that @xmath109 and @xmath110 represent the projections onto symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces ( trivial and alternating representations of @xmath107 ) , @xmath111 the projection onto the orthogonal subspace corresponding to the two - dimensional representation of @xmath107 , and that @xmath112 act as the pauli matrices in this subspace .",
    "this leads to lemma 2 of @xcite :    let @xmath113 , and define @xmath114 .",
    "then @xmath6 is a density matrix if and only if @xmath115    we will consider a subset of these states parameterised by two real variables @xmath116 .",
    "let @xmath117 . for positivity",
    "we require @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , which is equivalent to @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath121 is the normalisation factor , and is given by @xmath122 we will consider the eigenvalues of @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "if @xmath6 is an entangled state , we are interested in the _ sign _ of the eigenvalues : if all the eigenvalues are positive , then any present entanglement is not detected ; one negative eigenvalue detects the entanglement .",
    "we note that @xmath125 is independent of @xmath126 if @xmath127 , and for @xmath128 , @xmath129 if and only if @xmath130 , and hence we can ignore this normalisation factor for the purposes of determining the sign of the eigenvalues . some elementary algebra outlined in appendix",
    "a allows us to determine the eigenvalues of @xmath131 as @xmath132 and the eigenvalues of @xmath133 as @xmath134 ( we note that for @xmath135 and hence the second expression in both lists above is _ not _ an eigenvalue of the corresponding operator ) . to determine which states are detected by which maps , we need only look at when the above eigenvalues are positive / negative and hence we can ignore the normalisation @xmath136 , since for @xmath118 , @xmath137 .",
    "below is a figure giving an example for @xmath127 .",
    "it clearly shows states detected by @xmath101 but not @xmath102 , and vice - versa .     illustrating which maps detect the state @xmath6 for given values of @xmath116 .",
    "the white region represents states detected by both maps ( i.e. have a negative eigenvalue ) , the lightest grey represents states detected by @xmath101 but not @xmath102 ; the middle grey those detected by @xmath102 but not @xmath101 , and the darker grey is where neither map detects the state .",
    "the inside of the outlined box on the right of the graph represents states biseparable in the @xmath138 cut ( this can be determined from @xcite ) and hence @xmath139 will never detect these states . ]    interestingly , for the above states for @xmath128 all states detected by @xmath101 are also detected by @xmath102 . however no definite conclusions can be drawn from this since we are only looking at a small subset of symmetric states .",
    "it is a well known result that if a bipartite state violates the reduction criterion then it is 1-distillable .",
    "this was first proved in @xcite by giving an explicit distillation protocol and later in @xcite using a more abstract positive map formalism . in this section",
    "we investigate the potential for the maps introduced above to be used as a distillation criterion .",
    "consider a bipartite state @xmath17 .",
    "we recall the following theorem from @xcite :    @xmath6 is 1-undistillable if and only if @xmath140 for all 2-decomposable maps @xmath141 .",
    "the reduction map @xmath102 is 2-decomposable , and so",
    "if @xmath6 satisfies the relation @xmath142 then @xmath6 is 1-distillable .",
    "this gives us the distillation criterion at the start of this article .",
    "now , let us consider @xmath143 .",
    "let us act @xmath45 on @xmath144 , and the identity map on @xmath145 .",
    "we wish to consider what the condition @xmath146 means in terms of the distillation of @xmath6 .",
    "we can deduce this from the following lemma :    @xmath147    _ proof _ again by induction .",
    "trivial for @xmath31 ; assuming the @xmath32 case , @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150 and hence the result holds by induction .",
    "@xmath82    from this result",
    "it is clear that @xmath151 and so condition ( [ newred ] ) is equivalent to ( [ re ] ) , the violation of the reduction criterion .",
    "in this paper we have given a set of positive but not completely positive maps that can be used to define a new set of separability criteria , and we have shown that they can be thought of as multi - party forms of the reduction criterion .",
    "we have analysed the entanglement detecting powers of these maps , and have shown that there are states that @xmath101 detects but not @xmath102 , and vice - versa .",
    "it is highly likely that there will be similar results for the maps in general , and in theory , by using @xmath0-party analogues of the werner states , we could obtain further results .",
    "it remains to be seen ( although from the above results it seems unlikely ) whether there is any hierarchy within these separability criteria .",
    "we have also analysed the criteria from a distillation viewpoint , and have shown that we can recover the criteria for distillation that we obtain from the reduction criterion .",
    "the author would like to thank paul butterley for providing the impetus behind the above work , matthias christandl for a very illuminating conversation , lieven clarisse and anthony sudbery for checking the final manuscript , and finally the engineering and physical sciences research council ( uk ) for supporting this work .",
    "in this appendix we give a few more details of the calculations required to obtain the eigenvalues of the given maps in section 3 .",
    "suppose that @xmath113 .",
    "then defining @xmath152 it can easily be shown that @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath154 , the projectors @xmath155 are orthogonal , and project onto a subspace of dimension @xmath156 , and @xmath157 act as pauli matrices within the subspace of @xmath111 .",
    "hence the eigenvalues of @xmath6 are given by @xmath158 @xmath159 this allows us to easily investigate the properties of @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "now take @xmath117 with @xmath162 as defined above .",
    "we reiterate that for positivity we require @xmath118 , and @xmath120 . inverting the relations for @xmath109 etc . in terms of @xmath163 , and some tedious but elementary algebra allows us to write @xmath164 and @xmath165 from which , using ( [ eig ] ) above also , we can easily determine the eigenvalues of @xmath131 and @xmath133 given in equations ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) above .",
    "we finish by noting that we do not need to consider @xmath166 additionally , as it can be shown to have identical eigenvalues to @xmath131 ( this follows simply from the symmetry of @xmath6 between systems 2 and 3 , and the symmetry of the expressions for @xmath163 in terms of @xmath109 etc . ) .",
