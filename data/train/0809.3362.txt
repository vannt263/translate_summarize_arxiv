    "materials with restricted geometry , such as semiconductor quantum - well structures ,  @xcite quantum dots and wires ,  @xcite organic thin films  @xcite as well as quasiperiodic structures ,  @xcite are nowadays subjects of growing interest from both fundamental and practical points of view .",
    "an attributive peculiarity of almost all of them is the presence of disorder , which can be both of an intrinsic nature ( imperfections of the structure itself ) and originated from a random environment .",
    "whenever disorder is involved , anderson s ideas about localization of quasiparticles states come into play .",
    "@xcite in three dimensions ( 3d ) , the states at the center of the quasiparticle band remain extended for a relatively weak disorder ( of magnitude smaller than the bandwidth ) , while the other states ( in the neighborhood of the band edges ) turn out to be exponentially localized .",
    "this implies the existence of two mobility edges which separates the phases of extended and localized states .",
    "@xcite on the contrary , uncorrelated disorder of any magnitude causes localization of all one - particle eigenstates in one dimension ( 1d )  @xcite and two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "@xcite    since late eighties , however , it has been realized that extended states may survive on 1d systems if the disorder distribution is correlated .",
    "thus , a short - range correlated disorder was found to stabilize the extended states at special resonance energies . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "such extended states form a set of null measure in the density of states ,   implying the absence of mobility edges in these systems .",
    "in contrast , systems with long - range correlations of disorder support a set of delocalized states within a finite bandwidth ,  @xcite giving rise to mobility edges . theoretical predictions of localization suppression on 1d geometries , due to correlations of the disorder distribution , were confirmed experimentally in semiconductor superlattices with intentional correlated disorder ,  @xcite as well as in single - mode waveguides with correlated scatterers .",
    "@xcite    among 1d models with extended states , aperiodic anderson models  @xcite with an incommensurate site potential represent a class of particular interest .",
    "these models have been extensively investigated in the literature ,   and the localized or extended nature of the eigenstates has been related to general characteristics of aperiodic site - energy distributions .",
    "interesting realizations of this kind of distribution are achieved when weakly aperiodic potentials are considered : these systems support the occurrence of mobility edges , in a close analogy with the standard 3d anderson model .",
    "@xcite    a key question in any general theory of aperiodic systems is the relationship between a given aperiodic site - energy distribution and physical properties of the system .",
    "nowadays , the solution of this problem is still lacking .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , some important results have been obtained concerning the dynamics of elementary excitations , like electrons , phonons , excitons , polaritons , spin waves , plasmons or magnons , propagating through different classes of aperiodic lattices .",
    "@xcite in these studies , relevant physical properties were analyzed in terms of appropriate model hamiltonians .",
    "recently , the dynamics of a single electron in homogeneous systems subjected to a uniform static electric field has received much attention . under this constraint ,",
    "the electron undergoes the so - called bloch oscillations ,  @xcite whose amplitude is proportional to the energy bandwidth .",
    "electronic bloch oscillations were observed for the first time in semiconductor superlattices  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) . a similar phenomenon of sustained oscillations of the electromagnetic field , named photon bloch oscillations ,",
    "have been also found in 2d waveguide arrays and optical superlattices based on porous silicon .",
    "@xcite in disordered systems , bloch oscillations were predicted to occur in both 1d  @xcite and 2d  @xcite geometries whenever the disorder distribution is long - range correlated .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations was found to carry information about the energy difference between the two mobility edges , existing in these systems .",
    "the occurrence of bloch oscillations was also theoretically argued for 1d chains with aperiodic slowly varying potentials .",
    "@xcite a spectroscopic manifestation of bloch oscillations is found in the appearance of the wannier - stark ladder in the absorption spectrum .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , apart from the generalization of the previous work ,  @xcite done for a one - dimensional system , to a 2d system , we consider an electron subjected to an external uniform electric field .",
    "the latter brings new features to the electron wave packet dynamics moving in incommensurate potential .",
    "in particular , despite a quasi - stochasticy of the system , sustained bloch oscillations can be observed , previously believed to exist only for a periodic structures . in order to produce an aperiodic ( 2d ) site potential , the formalism used in ref .",
    "@xcite was considered .",
    "it consists in using a sinusoidal function whose phases @xmath6 and @xmath7 varies as a power - law .",
    "the power - law exponent controls the degree of aperiodicity in the site potential .",
    "we start by employing an exact diagonalization formalism to compute the _",
    "dc _ conductance and participation number in the absence of the electric field .",
    "we numerically demonstrate that their size behavior is consistent with the existence of extended states near the band center for weakly aperiodic potentials . in this regime ,",
    "the wave - packet dynamics becomes ballistic .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the wave - packet dynamics in the presence of an external uniform electric field .",
    "we show that in the limit of a weakly aperiodic site potential , the electric field promotes sustained bloch oscillations of the electronic wave - packet .",
    "the frequency of these oscillations can be understood within the framework of a semi - classical approach .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section we present our model and quantities of interest . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , the results of the numerical simulations of the dc conductance , participation number and electronic wave - packet dynamics are discussed .",

    "the frequency of the potential oscillations diverge in the thermodynamic limit , resulting in a fairly uncorrelated sequence of the on - site energies .",
    "because of that , this case is usually named as the _ pseudo - random regime_. oppositely , it was demonstrated that the range @xmath28 supports a phase of extended states in the neighborhood of the band center .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the _ pseudo - random regime _ , it is the average wavelength of the potential oscillations that diverges in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "because of the slower divergence of the oscillation wavelength , this regime is usually named as _ weakly aperiodic_. the uniform case is recovered at @xmath29 . recently",
    ", the effect of this kind of aperiodicity on the phonon and magnon @xmath25 modes has attracted a renewed interest .",

    "in contrast , the spread of the wave - packet is bounded for pseudo - random realization of the site potential ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "these results indicate that the underlined @xmath101 aperiodic model under study undergoes a metal - insulator transition .",
