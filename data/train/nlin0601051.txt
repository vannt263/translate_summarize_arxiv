    "this paper chiefly focuses on the digital chaotic ciphers . in the digital world nowadays , the security of digital images becomes more important since the communications of digital products over network occur more and more frequently .",
    "thus , to protect the content of digital images , some specific encryption systems are needed . due to",
    "some intrinsic features of images , such as bulk data capacity and high correlation among pixels , traditional encryption algorithms such as des , idea and rsa are not suitable for practical image encryption , especially under the scenario of on - line communications .",
    "the main obstacle in designing image encryption algorithms is that it is rather difficult to swiftly permute and diffuse data by traditional means of cryptology . in this respect ,",
    "chaos - based algorithms have shown their superior performance . by considering the advantages of high - level efficiency and simplicity of one - dimensional chaotic systems [ elnashaie and abasha , 1995 ] .",

    "a diffusion process is performed to confuse the relationship between cipher - image and plain - image . by taking advantage of the exceptionally good properties of composition of trigonometric chaotic maps ( @xmath0 ) such as mixing ,",

    "we first review the one parameter families of trigonometric chaotic maps which are used to construct the @xmath0 .",
    "one - parameter families of chaotic maps of the interval [ 0 , 1 ] with an invariant measure can be defined as the ratio of polynomials of degree n [ jafarizadeh et al . ,",
    "2001 ] : @xmath1 where * f * substitute with chebyshev polynomial of type one @xmath2 for @xmath3 and chebyshev polynomial of type two @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "we used their conjugate or isomorphic maps .",
    "conjugacy means that the invertible map @xmath6 maps @xmath7 $ ] into @xmath8 and transform maps @xmath9 into @xmath10 defined as : @xmath11 @xmath12 the map @xmath13 is reduced to logistic one with @xmath14 .",
    "one can show that these maps have two interesting properties .",
    "the first one is that @xmath15 and @xmath16 maps have only one fixed point attractor @xmath17 provided that their parameter depend on interval @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the second one is that at @xmath20 and @xmath21 bifurcate to chaotic regime without having any period doubling or period - n - tupling scenario and remain chaotic for all @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the map @xmath24 also has only one fixed point attractor @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "it bifurcates to chaotic regime at @xmath27 , and remains chaotic for @xmath28 .",
    "finally it bifurcates at @xmath29 .",
    "when control parameter belong to @xmath30 , then @xmath17 would be its corresponding fix point(see fig .",

    "+ using the above hierarchy of family of one - parameter chaotic maps we can generate a new hierarchy of families of many - parameter chaotic maps with an invariant measure simply from the composition of these maps . by the composition of maps eqs . ( 2)-(3 ) , we can generate one - dimensional many - parameter chaotic maps , which can be written in the following way : @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath41    one can show that the chaotic regions are : @xmath42 for odd integer values of @xmath43 .",
    "if one of the integers happens to become even , then the chaotic region in the parameter space can be defined by @xmath44 and @xmath45 . out of these regions , they have only period one stable fixed points . the introduced maps eqs .",
    "( 7)-(8 ) follows the same measure eq .",
    "the relation between the control parameters of composed maps and @xmath46 is presented in our previous paper [ jafarizadeh and behnia , 2002 ] .",
    "it has been noticed that there exists an interesting relationship between chaos and cryptography : many properties of chaotic systems have their corresponding counterparts in traditional cryptosystems , such as : ergodicity and confusion , sensitivity to initial conditions / control parameter and diffusion . in cryptographic terms , ergodicity claims that it is very hard to predict the actual position of a point from its initial position . moreover , after experiencing enough iterations , every position within the whole block is equally likely to be the actual position for almost every starting point ( confusion ) . +",
    "a transformation t is ergodic , if it has the probability that for almost every @xmath47 , the orbit @xmath48 of @xmath47 is a sort of replica of @xmath49 itself .",
    "formally , we shall say that t is ergodic if each invariant set a , i.e. ; a set such that t@xmath50(a)=a , is trivial in the sense that it has measure either zero or one .",

    ", the study , based on invariant measure analysis , can be useful for confirming the ergodicity behavior of a map .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath56 provides the simplest information about chaoticty .",
    "it can be computed by considering the separation of two nearby trajectories evolving in the same realization of the random process as follow [ dorfman , 1999 ] : @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "it is obvious that its negative values , show that the system is under influence of fix point ( attractor ) and its positive values show that the system follows repeller [ dorfman , 1999 ] . also , the lyapunov number is independet of initial point , provided that the motion inside the invariant manifold is ergodic .",
    "thus @xmath59 characterizes the invariant manifold of chaotic maps as a whole . in chaotic region ,",
    "chaotic maps are ergodic as birkhof ergodic theorem predicts [ keller , 1998 ] . in non - chaotic region of the parameter ,",
    "lyapunov characteristic exponent is negative definite , since in this region , we have only single period fixed points without bifurcation . now for composition of chaotic maps eqs .",
    "( 7)-(8 ) : @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "thus @xmath62 characterizes the invariant manifold of @xmath63 as a whole .",
    "therefore , these maps are ergodic in certain region of their parameters space as explained above . in the complementary region of the parameters",
    "space they have only a single period one attractive fixed point .",
    "also in contrary to the most of usual one - dimensional one - parameter or many - parameters family of maps they have only a bifurcation from a period one attractive fixed point to chaotic state or vice - versa .",
    "a possible way to describe the key space might be in terms of positive lyapunov exponents . by considering the lyaponuv exponent of one - dimensional many - parameter chaotic maps",
    "( 9 ) , we choose a chaotic region of @xmath0 ( see figs . 2 ( a)-(b ) ) .",
    "in order to show the capability of introduced model , we have used two simple models of one dimensional two - parameter chaotic maps for generating cryptosystem . by choosing ( n@xmath64=3 , n@xmath65=5 ) in eq .",

    "the points are rearranged in the following way : @xmath68 xor - ing is done in two stages .",
    "the first stage includes : @xmath69 and the next step :    @xmath70    by choosing image m@xmath71 with @xmath72 pixels , the encryption process can be explained with the block diagram ( fig .",
    "the image encryption can be done through the following steps :    * _ step 1 _ : according to the following relations , with the help of @xmath73 i , image @xmath74 can be permuted by swapping the pixels : @xmath75 @xmath76 * _ step 2 _ : to diffuse the image with using xor possess , we use @xmath77 ii in the permuted image .",

    "( 15 ) which is introduced as follows : @xmath82",
    "first take the encryption key , then we implement the introduced model of encryption on sample image ( boat of size 256@xmath83256 ) as our plain - image fig .",
    "4(a ) . the encrypted image is presented in fig .",
    "where we have used visual c++ running program in a personal computer with 2.4 ghz pentium iv , 256 mb memory and 80 gb hard - disk capacity .",
    "the average time used for encryption / decryption on 256 grey - scale images of size 256@xmath83256 is shorter than 0.4s . in order to encrypt the image , permutation and xor - ing process",
    "are done in the following way : @xmath84    @xmath85    @xmath86 as shown by figs .",
    "4(c)-(d ) , the decryption process with wrong keys ( @xmath87=2.10155400000001 in permutation and @xmath88=61.52200000000005 in xor - ing ) generates an image with a random behavior . the sensitivity to initial conditions , which is the main characterization of chaos , guarantees the security of our scheme .",
    "the preformed experiments results show that the new algorithm validly solves problem of encryption failure caused by the small key space and weak security .",
    "+ statistical analysis , performed on the proposed image encryption algorithm , demonstrates superior confusion and diffusion properties of the algorithm .",
    "so , strongly resists statistical attacks .",
    "one typical example is shown in figs .",
    "5(a)-(b ) .",
    "5(b ) , shows the histogram of the ciphered image where it is fairly uniform and significantly different with respect to the histogram of the original image .",
    "a good encryption scheme should resist all kinds of known attacks , such as + known - plain - text attack , cipher - text only attack , statistical attack , differential attack , and various brute - force attacks .",
    "some security analysis have been performed on the proposed image encryption scheme , including the most important ones like key space analysis , information entropy and statistical analysis which have demonstrated the satisfactory security of the new scheme .",
    "key space size is the total number of different keys that can be used in the encryption system . as mentioned above ,",
    "the key of the cryptosystem in the introduced algoritem is composed of three parts : permutation parameters , xor - ing stage i and xor - ing stage ii parameters .",
    "key space size in our introduced example eqs .",
    "( 10)-(11 ) consists of 8 control parameter and 4 initial conditions . as it was",
    "shows in figs .",
    "4(c)-(d ) cryptosystem is completely sensitive to secret keys .",
    "if the precision will be @xmath89 , the key space size for just initial conditions is @xmath90 .",
    "it is nessesery to remmember that the general model eqs .",
    "( 7)-(8 ) allows us to increase the key space size with respect to level of security .",
    "therefore , the key space is very large and can resist all kinds of brute - force attacks .",
    "information theory is a mathematical theory of data communication and storage founded in 1949 by claude e. shannon . to calculate the entropy _",
    "h(s ) _ of a source _ s _ , we have : @xmath91 where @xmath92 represents the probability of symbol @xmath93 . actually , given that a real information source seldom transmits random messages , in general , the entropy value of the source is smaller than the ideal one .",
    "however , when these messages are encrypted , their entropy should ideally be 8 . if the output of such a cipher emits symbols with an entropy of less than 8",
    ", then there exists a predictability which threatens its security .",
    "we have calculated the infomation entropy for encrypted image fig .",
    "4(b ) : @xmath94 the obtained value is very close to the theoretical value 8 . apparently , comparing it with the other existing algorithms , such as [ xiang , 2006 ] , the proposed algorithm is much more closer to the ideal situation .",
    "this means that information leakage in the encryption process is negligible , and so the encryption system is secure upon the entropy attack .      to test the correlation between two adjacent pixels in plain - image and ciphered image ,",
    "the following procedure was carried out .",
    "we randomly selected 1000 pairs of two adjacent ( in vertical , horizontal , and diagonal direction ) pixels from plain - image and ciphered image .",
    "then we calculated the correlation coefficients [ chen , 2004 ] , respectively ( see table  [ tab:1 ] and figs .",
    "6(a)-(b ) by using the following two formulas : @xmath95 where @xmath96 @xmath97 is the estimation of mathematical expectations of x , @xmath98 is the estimation of variance of x and @xmath99 is the estimation of covariance between x and y. where x and y are grey - scale values of two adjacent pixels in the image .      to test the influence of one - pixel change on the whole encrypted image by the proposed algorithm ,",
    "two common measures were used : npcr and uaci [ chen and ueta , 1999 ] .",
    "the number of pixels change rate ( npcr ) have been measured to see the influence of changing a single pixel in the original image on the encrypted image .",
    "the unified average changing intensity ( uaci ) measures the average intensity of differences between the plain - image and ciphered image .",
    "we take two encrypted images , c@xmath64 and c@xmath65 , whose corresponding original images have only one - pixel difference .",
    "we label the grey scale values of the pixels at grid ( i , j ) of @xmath100 and c@xmath65 by c@xmath64(i , j ) and c@xmath65(i , j ) , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 have the same size .",
    "then , d(i , j ) is determined by @xmath100(i , j ) and c@xmath65(i , j ) , that is , if @xmath100(i , j)= @xmath101(i , j ) , then , d(i , j)=1 ; otherwise , d(i , j)=o .",
    "npcr and ucal are defined by the following formulas : @xmath102 @xmath103 \\times 100\\%\\ ] ] where , w and h are the width and length of the image .",
    "we obtained npcr=0.41751% and ucai=0.3314% . with regard to obtained results",
    ", it seems that the proposed algorithm has a good ability to resist differential attack .",
    "in this paper , we propose a new scheme based on the hierarchy of one dimensional chaotic maps of interval[0,@xmath104 ) . the chaotic properties such as mixing and sensitive dependence on initial conditions and control parameters are suitably utilized while the limitation and weaknesses of the chaotic encryption system are effectively overcome .",
    "we have used composition form of chaotic maps in order to increase both the number of keys ( control parameters ) and complexities involved in the algorithm . by using the composition of chaotic maps",
    ", we can increases the confusion in the encryption process .",
    "it should be mentioned that increasing the confusion in encryption results in increasing security in cryptosystem .",
    "furthermore , the introduced cryptosystem is very robust to attacks whether it is based on statistical or reasoning analysis .",
    "as it was shown by differential attack on encrypted image , the system is also very sensitive with respect to the small changes in the plaintext . according to the performed analysis",
    ", the algorithm can satisfy most of the performances required such as high level of security , large key space and the acceptable encryption speed .",
    "our presented cryptosystem is of practicality and reliable value having to be adopted for internet image encryption , transmission applications , secure commination and other information security fields .",
