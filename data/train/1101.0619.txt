    "striped patterns of spin and charge order have been observed in a wide range of antiferromagnetic oxides since the initial discovery in la@xmath7nd@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10.@xcite interest has been sustained by continuing uncertainty about the true importance of stripe correlations for the mechanism of superconductivity in the layered cuprates . in some models ,",
    "for example , stripe correlations assist in the formation of pairing instabilities that can lead to superconductivity,@xcite whereas according to experiment static charge stripes suppress superconductivity.@xcite .",

    "the stripe order is particularly stable owing to a combination of two factors , firstly a commensurability effect that pins the charge stripes to the lattice , and second a stripe periodicity which is the same for the magnetic and a charge order.@xcite at this doping level lsno displays long range ( @xmath17 ) charge order,@xcite making it an ideal material in which to probe the charge ordered state . the magnetic excitation spectrum in the ordered stripe phase of lsno with @xmath18 has been investigated in some detail by neutron inelastic scattering and found to contain two distinct components , ( i ) quasi - two - dimensional spin - wave excitations of the afm - ordered regions , extending to @xmath1980 mev in energy,@xcite and ( ii ) a low energy ( @xmath20mev ) quasi - one - dimensional ( q-1d ) magnetic fluctuation consistent with short - range afm correlations along the charge stripes.@xcite a two - component spectrum with qualitatively similar characteristics has also been observed in la@xmath21sr@xmath22nio@xmath2 .",

    ", however , there is no microscopic model of the magnetic interactions in lsno that provides a unified description of the complete magnetic spectrum .",
    "the aim of the present study was to work towards a better understanding of the low - energy q-1d magnetic correlations by comparing neutron scattering data from two doping levels , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( both with @xmath26 ) , and by examining in more detail the energy lineshape of the magnetic scattering .",

    "instead , the diffuse scattering appears to be an intrinsic property of individual charge stripes embedded in the afm matrix formed by the ni@xmath15 spins , consistent with the interpretation in terms of q-1d correlations among spins in the charge stripes.@xcite    in this work we have also carefully measured the low - energy lineshape of the q-1d diffuse scattering . to model the lineshape we recall that the dynamical part of the scattering is proportional to the linear response function @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the energy transferred to the system",

    "the fact that the fitted @xmath83 is non - zero provides a clear indication that the q-1d diffuse scattering is inelastic rather than quasielastic . to assess",
    "how robust this result is we repeated the fit with @xmath83 fixed at zero , corresponding to a quasielastic lineshape .",

    "further thought is needed , therefore , if we are to reconcile this information with our understanding of the q-1d magnetic diffuse scattering .",
    "the model of an afm spin chain to describe the spin correlations along the ni@xmath23 charge stripes is reasonable providing the coupling between the spin chain and the afm order of the ni@xmath15 spins can be neglected .",
    "the justification for neglect of this coupling is that the net heisenberg exchange acting on the ni@xmath23 sites from the afm - ordered ni@xmath15 spins cancels at the mean - field level , so the coupling between the spin chain and the afm order is frustrated .",
    "however , if the individual ni@xmath23ni@xmath15 exchange interactions are strong enough then a weak ferromagnetic ( fm ) order could be induced on the ni@xmath23 stripes combined with a canting of the afm order of the ni@xmath15 spins .",
    "such a possibility has been proposed by klingeler _",
    "based on magnetization data.@xcite weak fm order would be difficult to detect in diffraction experiments because the associated magnetic bragg peaks would coincide with the bragg peaks from the crystal lattice . nevertheless , the competition between induced fm order and afm correlations from an effective afm exchange along the stripes could provide an explanation for the observed gapped dispersion .",
    "such a model has been investigated recently with promising results.@xcite",
