    "the gluons reach of thermal equilibrium to a considerable extent faster , than quarks . according to estimations , equilibrium time of gluons is @xmath46 fm / c and for quarks one is @xmath47 fm / c , i.e. it is possible the production of hot glue at first stage  @xcite .",

    "the resulting equation of state ( eos ) is in good agreement with lattice data over a wide temperature range between @xmath3 and 5@xmath3 .",
    "however in spite of this the thermal gluon mass have strong increase in the vicinity of the phase transition at decrease of @xmath14 . furthermore , close to a phase transition the coupling constant @xmath58 , that is correctness of perturbative of calculations is questionable .",

    "the lattice calculations shows that @xmath61 drops by factor of 10 when @xmath14 decrease from 2 @xmath3 to @xmath3  @xcite also for three colors the value @xmath62 remains large , but finite . in hard thermal loop ( @xmath63 )",
    "perturbation theory the thermal mass @xmath64 and gluonic debye mass @xmath61 are connected by relation  @xcite    @xmath65    however in nonperturbative theory this relation can be broken down  @xcite .    recently in the paper  @xcite was considered interesting phenomenological model of confinement . in region below @xmath3 in a pure @xmath43 gauge theory are color singlet of heavy glueballs . approaching @xmath3",
    "the gluons are liberated , followed by sudden increase of energy and entropy density .",
    "when approaching the phase transition from above , the decrease of thermodynamic values is not caused by increase of masses(unlike  @xcite ) , but caused by decrease of number active degrees of freedom .",
    "when @xmath14 comes closer to @xmath3 , more and more of gluons are absorbed by glueballs .",
    "it is assumed that thermal gluons mass @xmath64 follows roughly the behavior of the debye mass , i.e. it decreases .",
    "however the entropy density @xmath66 will overshoot the lattice entropy because light masses near @xmath3 .",
    "this difference may be accounted in quasiparticle model by modifying of number effective degrees of freedom in ( [ eq.3 ] ) , ( [ eq.4 ] ) @xmath67    the explicit value @xmath68 may be estimated as the ratio of the lattice entropy and entropy ( [ eq.3 ] ) with a dropping mass @xmath64 . at @xmath69",

    "@xcite was used the phenomenological parameterization of coupling constant in quasiparticles model in accordance with lattice data .",
    "however close to @xmath3 the coupling constant is sufficiently great , therefore in the vicinity of the phase transition the perturbative methods are not expected to be reliability .    in the paper  @xcite",

    "was considered the phenomenological model of confinement , where the decrease of thermodynamic values at @xmath7 from above is caused no increase of mass , but by decrease of the number of active degrees of freedom ( i.e. by modification @xmath475 ) .",
    "it is supposed , that behaviour of thermal gluon mass @xmath64 is similar with behaviour of debye mass , i.e. it decreases with @xmath474 from above .",

    "that follow from conservation of entropy and of number of net nucleons .",
    "the hadron part of mixed phase appears also with decrease of number of degrees of freedom  the same as for constituent quarks .",
    "however at thermal freeze - out ( at @xmath493 ) hadrons appears already with normal number of degrees of freedom .",

    "we use for heavy nuclei the temperature of thermal freeze - out @xmath407 mev ( as in `` standard '' model  @xcite the normalization of baryons and mesons spectra in the present model is no free parameter , but defined by initial condition in quark - gluon plasma .    one should note that there are the models for description of particle production with simultaneous chemical and thermal freeze - out  @xcite , where 2 - 3 free parameters describe well the spectra at rhic energy . in the present work we use `` standard '' scenario with two freeze - out - chemical and thermal .",
    "the main object of present work is no study the whole spectra at sps and rhic , but the study of dependence of spectra from initial state and from phase transition stage .",
    "for this aim we consider in sec.[sec5 ] the analogous isentropic problem by the use of ordinary perturbative theory up to order @xmath50 , where @xmath422 is running coupling .",
    "we do not find in this approximation of noticeable difference for particles spectra in comparison with effective quasiparticle model , although this model disagrees with su(3 ) lattice data in region of phase transition ( unlike quasiparticle model ) .",
    "however it can be shown  @xcite that in this model we have the too great energy loss of gluon and quark jets in plasma ( @xmath494 ) , that contradict to suppression of @xmath419-spectra , reported by phenix  @xcite .    in this section we consider also the quasiparticle model with phenomenological parametrization of coupling @xmath12 , which gives good fit of new lattice data .",
    "we investigate here also the initial condition in plasma at rhic energy ( on the basic of equation of type([eq.23 ] ) .",
    "we find that baryons and mesons spectra in this model practically do not differ from spectra in effective quasiparticle model .",

    "<S> we use quasiparticle description of deconfined matter in nuclear collisions at finite temperature and chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that evolution of expanding system is isentropic . using theoretical formulas and experimental meaning for the average multiplicity of charged and neutral particles and also of net nucleons ( @xmath0 ) per unit central rapidity </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the initial temperature @xmath1 , and the volume @xmath2 for the collisions of heavy nuclei ( pb+pb and au+au ) at sps and rhic energies . at calculations we use the conservation of entropy and of number net nucleons in initial plasma stage and on the stage of phase transition at temperature @xmath3 , where we take into account the phase of constituent quarks @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we use at calculation the effective quasiparticle model with decrease of thermal gluon mass @xmath6 at @xmath7 from above . </S>",
    "<S> this model agrees with lattice data . </S>",
    "<S> the particle ratios for sps and rhic are defined by early chemical freeze - out at temperature close to @xmath3 ( at values of chemical potential @xmath8 mev and 50 mev for sps and rhic ( at @xmath9 gev ) correspondingly ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of baryons and mesons are calculated at temperature of thermal freeze - out @xmath10 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative characteristic of these spectra ( for example , the normalization for baryons and mesons ) are determined in the present model by initial state - quark - gluon plasma . at calculation of spectra </S>",
    "<S> we assume that averaged transverse flow velocity @xmath11 have both direct particles and paternal resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that values of @xmath11 increase for energy rhic in comparison with sps . </S>",
    "<S> we had investigated also the analogous problem of nuclear collisions in quasiparticle model with phenomenological parametrization of running coupling @xmath12 , which increase at @xmath7 from above ( in difference from effective quasiparticle model ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have here agreement with new lattice data . </S>",
    "<S> we do not found in this model quantitative difference for spectra in comparison with effective quasiparticle model . </S>",
    "<S> however it can be shown , that in this model we have dramatic situation for energy loss of gluon jets in plasma . </S>"
