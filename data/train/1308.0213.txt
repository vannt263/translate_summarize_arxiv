    "@xcite , observed that in turbulent flows the variance of the nonlinear term in the navier - stokes equations is on average smaller than would be expected from a gaussian estimate .",
    "more precisely , if one constructs a flowfield consisting of random statistically independent fourier modes exhibiting the same energy spectrum as the turbulent flow considered , the variance of the nonlinear term will be larger than for the original field .",
    "this depletion of nonlinearity is the result of a self - organization process of the turbulent flow , a process which is , itself , due to the nonlinear term in the navier - stokes equations .",
    "kraichnan and panda s study was motivated by the possible importance of velocity - vorticity alignment in turbulent flows , which they showed to be one expression of a more general , underlying property of nonlinear systems .",
    "we consider that this general property , the depletion of nonlinearity , is an important feature of turbulent flows , since the nonlinearity of the navier - stokes equations is the heart of the turbulence problem .",
    "the nonlinear term of the navier - stokes equations is a vector and its mean value is zero in isotropic turbulence .",
    "an obvious question to ask is then : _ how strong are the fluctuations of the nonlinear term and how strong is its depletion ? _",
    "these questions will be addressed in the present investigation .",
    "furthermore , we will address the following questions with respect to this phenomenon : _ how does the depletion of nonlinearity vary as a function of the reynolds number ? does this depletion of nonlinearity manifest itself in the inertial range ?",
    "what are the physical consequences of this depletion ? _    in order to answer these questions we focus on the nonlinearity spectrum , which we will define below .",
    "this spectrum measures the strength of the fluctuations of the nonlinear term as a function of scale , just like the energy spectrum does for the strength of velocity fluctuations . whereas the characterization of the energy spectrum has received an enormous amount of attention in the field of turbulence research , only very few investigations consider the nonlinearity spectrum . to our knowledge ,",
    "only the work by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite considered this quantity .",
    "@xcite , performed low resolution direct numerical simulations and compared their results to the direct interaction approximation ( dia ) .",
    "no information was obtained on the inertial range behavior of this quantity since the reynolds number was too low in their simulations .",
    "higher reynolds numbers could in principle be obtained by using the dia , but physically incorrect behaviour is observed in the inertial range dynamics of the original , eulerian dia ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , considered only the scaling of the potential part of the advection term , assuming that the full nonlinear term scales as its potential part .",
    "only the high resolution simulations by @xcite give an idea on the inertial range scaling of several fourth order spectra .",
    "in the present work we use a version of the dia in which the time - correlations are modified in order to yield results which are in agreement with kolmogorov s inertial range phenomenology . this approach allows to investigate the strength of the nonlinearity and its scaling properties in high reynolds number turbulence .",
    "we consider the case of a unit density , incompressible , isotropic , fully developed turbulent flow governed by @xmath0 with @xmath1 the velocity , @xmath2 the pressure , @xmath3 the viscosity and @xmath4 an isotropic forcing term , confined to the largest scales of the flow .",
    "the quantities @xmath5 and @xmath4 are a function of space @xmath6 and time @xmath7 .",
    "the time dependence will be omitted in the following , except for quantities which depend on two or more time - instants .",
    "the fourier transform of the velocity will be indicated by @xmath8 , and its evolution is given by @xmath9 u_i(\\bm k ) = n_i(\\bm k)+f_i(\\bm k),\\nonumber\\\\ n_i(\\bm k)=-\\frac{i}{2}p_{ijm}(\\bm k)\\iint \\delta(\\bm k-\\bm p-\\bm q)u_j(\\bm p)u_m(\\bm q)d\\bm pd\\bm q   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the pressure is eliminated using relation ( [ eq : divu ] ) and where @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 the energy spectrum is @xmath12 where the brackets indicate an ensemble average .",
    "the spectrum is defined such that @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "we define the wavenumber spectrum of the mean - square nonlinearity @xmath15 so that @xmath16 in the following @xmath17 will be called the nonlinearity spectrum .",
    "the spectra @xmath18 and @xmath17 represent the distribution over scales of the kinetic energy and the mean - square nonlinearity , respectively . omitting possible internal intermittency corrections ,",
    "the kinetic energy spectrum in statistically stationary high reynolds number isotropic turbulence scales at large @xmath19 as ( @xcite , in the following named k41 ) , @xmath20 with @xmath21 the mean dissipation rate , @xmath22 .",
    "here and throughout @xmath23 denotes a dimensionless function independent of the reynolds number , not necessarily the same whenever it appears .",
    "if one assumes that in the inertial range the nonlinearity spectrum is likewise determined by the dissipation rate and the wavenumber , one would obtain the scaling @xmath24 this is shown not to be the case and it will be shown that the scaling of @xmath17 is more closely given by @xmath25 where the large - scale velocity @xmath26 is defined in expression ( [ eq : defineu ] ) .",
    "this scaling implies , by integration of the latter expression up to @xmath27 , that the mean - square nonlinearity varies as @xmath28 for asymptotically high reynolds numbers ( @xmath29 is the taylor - scale reynolds number ) . it will furthermore be shown that @xmath30 tends to a non - unity value , independent of the reynolds number .",
    "this implies that not only @xmath17 , but also it gaussian estimate scales as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the nonlinearity spectrum computed from the same velocity field , assuming independence of the fourier modes .    in the following we will try to establish the scaling expressions ( [ eq : scalingw ] ) , ( [ eq : n2 ] ) and ( [ eq : scalingwg ] ) , and we will show how non - gaussian effects influence this scaling . in order to show clear scaling ranges ,",
    "high reynolds numbers are needed .",
    "we derive a dia expression for the nonlinearity spectrum , which we simplify to obtain an expression of the eddy - damped quasi - normal markovian ( edqnm ) type .",
    "this derivation is presented in section [ sec : closure ] . the resulting expression for the nonlinearity spectrum and its gaussian estimate",
    "are functionals of the energy spectrum , wavenumber and viscosity only , @xmath33\\nonumber\\\\",
    "w^g(k)=f[e(k),k],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , once we prescribe the energy spectrum and the reynolds number , we can evaluate @xmath17 and @xmath32 . in section [ sec : results ] we will perform a numerical integration of the edqnm closure of the lin - equation for the energy spectrum .",
    "the hereby obtained energy spectrum is then used to evaluate @xmath17 , @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and the dependence of these quantities on the wavenumber and reynolds number is investigated . in section [ sec : supergaussian ] the large - scale behaviour of the nonlinearity spectrum and its link with the reynolds - stress fluctuation spectrum is discussed .",

    "for instance , when @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , so that @xmath41 is not zero , and contributions from the infrared range will determine the integral .",
    "this allows to obtain the following approximation , @xmath49 which , assuming k41 scaling , yields @xmath50 we can thus analytically establish the scaling for @xmath32 .",
    "note that a simple dimensional analysis , based on the observation that the nonlinear transfer is dominated by sweeping , and proportional to the spectrum of the eulerian velocity gradient , @xmath51 gives the same expression ( [ eq : scalinggauss ] ) .",
    "this analysis ( which is a formulation of tennekes random sweeping estimate ( @xcite ) ) implicitly assumes independence of the fourier modes at different scales and is thus equivalent to the gaussian estimate . in a true turbulent field in which the modes are not independent , this analysis is not _ a priori _ satisfied , and how the dependence between fourier modes will alter this scaling , _",
    "i.e. _ , how the cumulant contributions to @xmath17 scale , will be considered in the following section .",
    "the direct interaction approximation ( @xcite ) allows to investigate the influence of the inter - dependence of the fourier modes in a turbulent flow under the assumption that the individual coupling between the triads is weak .",
    "the collective influence of the coupling of all triads together is however not necessarily weak and the dia can consider systems which are far from gaussianity . the obtained results by the original , eulerian , dia are not invariant under random galilean transformations , which is not in agreement with the physics of a turbulent flow .",
    "this manifests itself by the fact that the eulerian dia yields an energy spectrum which is not in agreement with kolmogov s scaling phenomenology , equation ( [ eq : k41 ] ) . in order to cure for this",
    ", the dia can be formulated in lagrangian coordinates ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting set of equations ( @xcite ) is complicated ( see @xcite , for a more tractable variant of lagrangian dia ) and depends on the entire history of the flow .",
    "our approach to analyze the effects of dependence of the modes avoids these problems , since we start from eulerian dia and explicitly model the time - dependence of the fourier modes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation time that we will use in the time - correlation functions is chosen such that the results are consistent with kolmogorov s scaling arguments .    a straightforward way to derive the closure expression for the mean - square nonlinearity",
    "is by using the generalized langevin model for the direct interaction approximation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this approach was also described in @xcite , and we used this approach to derive a closed expression for the mean - square advection term in @xcite .",
    "the dia langevin model is given by @xmath52 u_i(\\bm k , t)&=&q_i(\\bm k , t)-\\int_0^t\\eta(k , t , s)u_i(\\bm k , s)ds\\\\ & = & q_i(\\bm k , t)-d_i(\\bm k , t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an independent gaussian random variable with the same two - time correlation function as @xmath55 , @xmath56 @xmath57 is the response function ( or green s function ) and @xmath58 .",
    "the term @xmath59 is the damping term of the langevin equation , where the damping is due to nonlinear scrambling , or eddy damping , and viscous effects .",
    "since ( [ eq : langevin ] ) is a linear function of @xmath55 , it can be inverted , giving @xmath60    the spectrum of the mean - square nonlinearity is given by the square of the rhs of equation [ eq : langevin ] , @xmath61 the different terms that appear are then , @xmath62 the first term can be simplified by using the rules for gaussian quantities , leading to @xmath63 with @xmath32 given by ( [ eq : wgk ] ) . the second term is directly closed .",
    "the last term can be closed by using expression ( [ eq : inverted ] ) , yielding @xmath64 the resulting expression for @xmath17 is then ,    @xmath65    with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this expression , which is a function of the response function and the energy spectrum only , is closed within the dia formalism .      as was discussed in the beginning of section [ sec : dia ] , dia is a two - time theory which is not compatible with kolmogorov phenomenology . in order to obtain a single - time model which is , we introduce simplifying assumptions , which are now discussed .    first , to simplify expression ( [ eq : msnl5 ] ) we assume an exponential lagrangian decorrelation of the fourier modes , with a wavenumber - dependent characteristic correlation time which needs to be defined .",

    "some qualitative predictions can also be obtained from this expression .",

    "the cumulant contribution is positive .",
    "it will be seen in the following that these qualitative predictions are indeed in agreement with the results of the numerical integration of expression ( [ eq : msnl6 ] ) .",

    "this implies that at these scales the cumulant spectrum scales exactly like the gaussian spectrum as a function of wavenumber . in the dissipation",
    "range the cumulant contribution becomes more strongly negative , leading to a more important depletion of nonlinearity in these scales . in the far dissipation",
    "range the spectrum of the nonlinear term shows negative values for high reynolds numbers .",
    "this non - realizable behavior for @xmath100 might be due to the numerical integration of the expressions , or to the procedure we used to obtain single - time expressions , which does not guarantee the preservation of the realizability property of the eulerian dia .    at",
    "the inertial range scales the depletion of nonlinearity is thus approximately constant and the statistics for the mean - square nonlinearity are sub - gaussian .",

    "i.e. _ , what determines the level of depletion of nonlinearity , is currently under investigation .",
    "the super - gaussian behaviour in the large scales will be addressed in the following section .",
    "using dia techniques , expressions can be derived for the cumulant contributions to all sorts of correlations at arbitrary order .",
    "some details on the procedure are given in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , whereas the cumulant contributions to the mean - square nonlinearity spectrum are nonzero within the dia framework , fourth - order vorticity correlations , dissipation rate fluctuations and pressure - gradient fluctuations are all gaussian according to the dia , which seems to be in disagreement with observations from direct numerical simulations .",
    "the precise reason for this is still not clear at present .",
    "in addition to the expression for the mean - square nonlinearity , we derived expressions for the cumulants to the correlations    @xmath101    and    @xmath102    the first of these two expressions is the reynolds stress fluctuation spectrum , which gives a measure for the fluctuations of the reynolds stress at various scales .",

    "the cumulant part of the nonlinearity spectrum @xmath106 is given by the second and third line of expression ( [ eq : msnl5 ] ) .",
    "this shows that according to dia the energy fluctuation spectrum is given by its gaussian estimate , whereas the reynolds - stress fluctuation spectrum is not .",
    "it also shows that the non - gaussian part of @xmath107 is related , in a simple way , to the nonlinearity spectrum .    since , evidently , the single point correlation @xmath108 , we must have @xmath109 and therefore @xmath110 the spectrum of the cumulant to the reynolds - stress fluctuations @xmath111 contains thus , if it is non - zero , both positive and negative contributions , which sum up to zero when integrated over all scales .",
    "this is comparable to the nonlinear transfer spectrum , which also sums up to zero . according to relation ( [ eq : tijijw ] )",
    "we can link the spectrum @xmath111 to the nonlinearity spectrum .",

    "this negative contribution must be compensated by a positive contribution in the large scales in order to satisfy ( [ eq : tijij0 ] ) .",
    "the super - gaussian statistics in the nonlinearity spectrum at large scales are therefore , within the dia approach , directly linked to the depletion of nonlinearity in the small scales , through the relations ( [ eq : tijijw ] ) and ( [ eq : tijij0 ] ) , involving the reynolds stress fluctuation spectrum .",
    "in the present investigation we have considered and established the wavenumber scaling and reynolds number scaling of the mean - square nonlinearity .",
    "it is shown that , in the inertial and dissipation range , the nonlinearity spectrum is given by @xmath113 for very high reynolds numbers .",
    "the function @xmath95 tends to a constant value in the inertial range and its value is approximately @xmath114 times the value of its gaussian estimate .",
    "the total depletion of nonlinearity , measured by the ratio of @xmath88 to @xmath86 is shown to tend to a constant value of approximately @xmath90 .",
    "this sub - gaussian behavior of turbulence must be connected with a certain order in the flows , but how this manifests itself in an instantaneous flow field ( _ e.g. _ in terms of coherent flow structures ) can not be inferred from the statistical considerations presented here .",

    ", @xmath115 scales approximately as @xmath116 ( @xcite ) , the pressure gradient spectrum scales as @xmath117 note however that this scaling appears only at relatively high reynolds number ( @xcite ) compared to the appearance of k41 scaling for the energy spectrum . considering equation ( [ eq : wconc ] ) and ( [ eq : ep ] ) it is clear that at large reynolds numbers @xmath88 is only weakly determined by the variance of the pressure gradient .",

    "they argue that a complete reduction of sweeping is improbable for stochastically forced navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "their arguments are not in disagreement with the present investigation",
    ". the dependence of the large and small scales is influenced , and the sweeping , as estimated by purely kinematic arguments , is partially but definitely not completely suppressed . in this light the depletion of nonlinearity can also be interpreted as a reduction of eulerian acceleration , suggesting a larger eulerian coherence for turbulence than for advection by random fourier modes .",
    "the possible link of this enhanced coherence with inertial range and dissipation range intermittency is not clear at present .",
    "the super - gaussian values of the large - scales of the nonlinearity spectrum were shown to be related to the non - gaussianity of the reynolds - stress - fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the physical importance of this relation for the dynamics of turbulent flow seems to deserve further research .",
    "we mention here that a similar picture ( large - scale super - gaussian behaviour and sub - gaussian inertial range and dissipation range behavior ) , was observed in the depletion of advection ( @xcite ) , where the inertial range scaling of the advection spectrum also displayed a constant reduction with respect to its gaussian value .",
