    "research on gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has greatly benefitted of the _ swift _  mission ( @xcite ) .",
    "this space observatory carries three scientific instruments : the burst alert telescope ( bat ; barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ) , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) , and the ultra - violet optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) . when bat detects a grb , _ swift _ slews towards the source position within 1 - 2 minutes , and follows up the grb afterglow emission @xcite until it becomes too weak to be detected , usually a few days after the trigger .",
    "_ swift _ also delivers the position of a newly discovered source promptly to ground based observatories , which can observe the optical and radio afterglows in bands and sensitivities which can not be achieved by the space facility .",
    "therefore , grb observations in the _ swift _ age cover the temporal behaviour of grbs in many different electromagnetic bands from @xmath1  s after the trigger onwards . moreover , _ swift _",
    "has dramatically increased the statistics of grb afterglows observed ( about 90 grbs per year ) from the past .",
    "such comprehensive coverage and statistics have shown that the light curves of grbs at different wavelengths can be surprisingly diverse . during the afterglow",
    ", changes of the flux decay - rate or even rebrightenings can occur in some electromagnetic bands but not in others .",
    "an obvious example is the x - ray flares , which do not usually show an optical counterpart ( falcone et al .",
    "conversely , a few authors have examined grbs with episodes of optical rebrightening which have no clear equivalent in the x - ray band , such as grb081029 ( nardini et al .",
    "2011 , holland et al .",
    "2012 ) , and grb100621a ( greiner et al . 2013 ) .",
    "another less clear - cut case may be grb050401 ( de pasquale et al .",
    "these events are particularly puzzling since , after the optical rebrightening , the x - ray and optical light curves resume similar behaviour , with simultaneous change of slope .",
    "this has called for a deep revision of the emission models of grb afterglows , which in the past mostly involved a single emission component .",
    "observations indicate that a single component can not be responsible for the observed features , but all the components producing the afterglow may still be connected , and possibly have a common origin . according to the most accepted scenario ,",
    "the initial phase of @xmath0-ray emission arises when dissipation process(es ) occur in ultra - relativistic shells emitted by a central engine ( rees & mszros 1994 ) .",
    "the afterglow arises when the burst ejecta interact with the surrounding medium and produce two shocks ; one moving forward in the medium ( forward shock , or fs ) and another one inward into the ejecta ( reverse shock , or rs ) , causing their deceleration ( mszros & rees 1993 ; sari & piran 1999 ) .",
    "both shocks energize the electrons of the medium in which they propagate .",
    "the electrons in turn cool by synchrotron emission and produce the observed afterglow light .",
    "it is therefore possible that fs and rs can jointly contribute to the observed emission and , since their emissions peak at different wavelengths , produce the puzzling chromatic behaviour observed ( e.g. perley et al .",
    "2014 , urata et al .",
    "other scenarios put forward involve a residual ` prompt ' emission producing the x - rays ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2007 ) , up - scattering of the photons produced by fs by fast ejecta ( panaitescu 2008 ) , evolution of the physical parameters of the blast waves ( panaitescu et al . 2006 ) , and two - component jet ( de pasquale et al . 2009 ; liang et al . 2013 ) .    in this article , we present an ample dataset of the _ swift _ grb100814a and discuss the remarkable temporal properties of this event .",
    "grb100814a shows a conspicuous rebrightening in the optical bands between @xmath2 and @xmath3  ks after the burst trigger .",
    "such a rise of the optical flux has no clear counterpart in the x - ray light curve .",
    "however , the flux in both bands shows a similar quick decay after 200 ks .",
    "radio observations show a broad peak about @xmath4  s after the trigger , followed by a slow decay which is different from the rapid fall of the flux visible in the x - ray and optical at the same epoch .",
    "finally , we mention other _",
    "swift _ grbs that show comparable features and how the modeling adopted in this paper might be applied to their cases .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use the convention @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the flux density , @xmath7 is the time since the bat trigger , @xmath8 the frequency , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the temporal and spectral indices .",

    "this flux , however , is not due to the grb afterglow , but to the unrelated source 10 arcseconds from the burst position .",
    "the presence of a break at late time is obvious : if we try to fit the @xmath45 light curve from the beginning of the second orbit to @xmath52  s with a single power law we get an unsatisfactory result ( @xmath59 degrees of freedom , d.o.f . ) , while the use of a broken power law ( @xmath60 for @xmath61 ; @xmath62 for @xmath63 ) gives a very significant improvement ( @xmath64 d.o.f . ) . in this case , the best fit parameters are : decay indices @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67  ks . in both cases , we added a constant to the broken power law model to take into account the presence of the serendipitous source .",
    "we also tried to fit the light curve with a smoothly joined broken power law model @xcite , which enables us to examine different `` sharpness '' of the x - ray light curve break .",
    "we have found that the data do not discriminate between a smooth and a sharp transition . if all parameters are allowed to vary , a model with a sharp break ( @xmath68 in the beuermann et al .",

    "grb100814a was observed with 10 different ground - based optical telescopes ( see table  1 ) in a range of photometric bands . to minimise systematics between the different observatories and bands , where possible the same stars in the field surrounding grb100814a",

    "there are some practical limitations to this approach : the fields of view of some instruments are smaller than the basic set of secondary standards and the sensitivities of the instruments are limited to different brightness ranges .",

    "the resulting optical light curves are shown in fig  [ all_lcs ] . in order to improve our understanding of the behaviour of the optical light curve and check for the presence of chromatic evolution of the emission",
    ", we followed two approaches . in the first approach we normalised all of the light curves to a single filter , and in the second approach we analysed the light curves in different bands separately",
    "the first approach , as described in @xcite , consists of renormalizing the light curves to a single filter .",
    "the very early optical light curve varies rapidly .",
    "an optical flare peaks at @xmath86  s and then rapidly decays , basically giving no contribution after @xmath87  s. after this early flare , we have a phase in which the optical flux is roughly constant , followed by a decay starting at @xmath88  s in all filters .",
    "to investigate the early plateau and the following decay more throughly , we have renormalized the early data to the _ swift _",
    "@xmath89 band filter .",
    "we then fitted the @xmath90  s data points with a smooth broken power law , and the best fit parameters are @xmath91 , break time @xmath92  s , @xmath93 , with @xmath94 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : early_lcs ] the renormalized early optical light curves .",
    "the initial optical flare may be produced by the same process responsible for the early flaring activity in the x - ray , since the temporal behaviour is roughly similar .",
    "flares are likely produced by internal dissipation mechanisms , such as internal shocks , which occur when the ultrarelavitistic ejecta shells interact with each other .",
    "it is possible that the plateau we see between @xmath95 and @xmath96  s is due to a decreasing emission from internal dissipation and rising emission from the external shock .",
    "alternatively , the plateau might be due to a slow rise of the external shock emission only .",
    "we note that an initial plateau or shallow decay phase are associated to the external shock onset , as observed in several @xmath97 bursts @xcite .",
    "the origin of external shock emission is different from that due to internal dissipation mechanism .",
    "external shocks are produced by the interaction between ejecta and the circumburst medium and are likely to produce the long - lived and slowly varying afterglow emission .",
    "after @xmath98 , the optical flux follows the typical power law decay of grb afterglows ; the deceleration of the leading shell of the ejecta must have occurred at this time or earlier . in the following , we will assume that break time @xmath98 marks the deceleration time , and will investigate the grb afterglow from this time onwards .",
    "we will return to how the results of this article are affected if the actual deceleration is slightly earlier .",
    "since the study of internal dissipation mechanisms is not the goal of this paper , we will not discuss the initial optical flare any further .",
    "unfortunately , the sampling of our optical light curve between 10 and 20  ks is not good enough to ascertain precisely when the optical emission stops decaying and begins to rise .",
    "what we can say is that the rebrightening approximately started about 15  ks and culminated about 100  ks after the trigger , although there is no strong variation in flux between 50 and 200  ks , during which the light curves seem to form a plateau .    between 15  ks and 200  ks , during the optical rebrightening",
    ", the light curves do not seem to align .",
    "this might indicate that a process of chromatic evolution is taking place during the afterglow of grb100814a . in more detail",
    ", the rebrightening appears to be bluer than the other portions of the light curves .",
    "these results indicate that the optical spectrum during the rebrightening is different from that found before and after the rebrightening .",
    "this feature reinforces the idea that the rebrightening is due to different emission components .",
    "it is also possible that there is a chromatic evolution _ during _ the rebrightening itself .",
    "in fact , if we renormalize the light curves during the rise between 15 and 60  ks , the light curves during the plateau do not match one another , with the data points of the redder filters being systematically above those of the bluer filter .",
    "conversely , the light curves of the rise do not match one another if we renormalize them in the interval between 50 and 200  ks .",
    "however , the plateau phase , although being redder than the rise one , still shows a spectrum which is bluer than that of the following fast decay . in summary , it is possible that the rebrightening spectrum gets redder with time .",
    "this trend is found in other grbs , such as grb120404a ( guidorzi et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "we renormalized the late optical light curves to the @xmath81 band , since we have a good coverage in this filter in late observations .",

    "the residuals around the second break and in the third power law segment are small and randomly distributed around the fit , implying that the evolution during the first power law segment is either chromatic or that the model used is just not good enough , and that the evolution after the second break is achromatic .",
    "next , we allowed the decay slope @xmath109 and the break time @xmath110 to vary for each band independently .",
    "not only did the fit statistics significantly improve ( @xmath108/d.o.f .",

    "it is perhaps more correct to speak of ` trends ' rather than correlations but , thanks to some small error bars of the parameters we have derived , we can still safely state that the light curves in redder filters have higher peak fluxes and later peak times than those in the bluer filters .",

    "this however leads to critical questions regarding the sources of the emission in grb100814a : if the x - ray and the optical fluxes are due to the same component , why do they behave so differently with the optical showing a rebrightening ? and",
    "if the optical rebrightening is due to a different component , why does it end at about the time of the steep break in the x - ray ?",
    "+      in grb100814a both the x - ray flux and optical light curves initially show a shallow decay .",
    "slow early decay has been seen commonly in grb afterglows ( liang et al .",
    "2007 ) , both in the x - ray and in the optical .",
    "its origin is still a matter of debate .",
    "one of the most popular explanations is a phase of energy injection into the ejecta , which may be due to poynting flux emitted by the burst central engine or trailing shells of outflow that collide with the leading parts of it ( zhang et al .",
    "the steep , late decay observed in both the x - ray and in the optical bands at the late epoch could only be attributed to a jet phase in the context of the fs model .",
    "one can immediately check whether the standard fs model can explain the observed behaviour .",
    "the spectral and temporal indices of the flux of the observed bands are predicted by this model to be linked in relations which depend on the positions of the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath153 , the peak frequency @xmath138 and cooling frequency @xmath154 and the kind of expansion - collimated ( jet ) or spherical - and on the density profile of the surrounding medium , either constant ( like in the interstellar medium , ism ) or decreasing with radius ( like a stellar wind ) ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; sari piran & halpern 1999 ; chevalier & li 2000 ; kobayashi & zhang 2003a ) .",
    "the only ways to account for the rise of the optical light curves are to assume a transit of @xmath138 throughout the optical band , or the onset of the fs emission .",
    "the former would also explain the chromatic nature of the event .",
    "we note that we can fit the x - ray light curve as the sum of two components : one rapidly decaying , likely connected with the prompt emission , and a rising component that peaks at @xmath155  s , and successively produces the slow decay observed .",
    "if we assumed that this time were the peak time and the x - ray frequency @xmath156 hz ( @xmath157 ) were the peak frequency , we would find that even the x - ray is consistent with the extrapolation of the relation between these two quantities from the optical band ( bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "the x - ray peak would be shifted at much earlier time due to its higher frequency , but the x - ray and the optical would obey the same trends and be produced by the same component .    however ,",
    "if @xmath138 were approaching the optical band , one should observe a flux rise from the beginning of observations in the ism case or a decrease as @xmath158 decay slope for stellar wind ( with a density profile of @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the distance from the progenitor , kobayashi & zhang 2003a ) . neither of which are observed .",
    "furthermore , to keep @xmath161 in the optical band with a flat spectrum , one would require an extremely high value of kinetic energy of the ejecta ( see sect.s [ chromatic ] and [ rs - fs1 ] ) .",
    "the optical bump can not even be the onset of fs emission in the context of single component scenario , because one should not see the observed decrease of the x - ray and optical flux before it .",
    "the observed flux depends on parameters such as the fractions of blast wave energy given to radiating electrons and magnetic field @xmath162 and @xmath163 , the circumburst medium density @xmath164 , and the index of the power law energy distribution of radiating electrons @xmath165 .",
    "a temporal evolution of such parameters might explain the observed behaviour .",
    "an example is a change of density of the environment @xmath164 . for frequencies below the cooling break ,",
    "the flux is proportional to @xmath164 , while the flux in bands above the break does not depend on it .",
    "it is therefore possible that a rapid increase in @xmath164 causes an optical rebrightening and simultaneously leaves the x - ray flux decay unperturbed , as we observe .",
    "does this explanation predict the spectral changes that we see in the grb100814a rebrightening ?",
    "since @xmath166 , one may think that @xmath164 could increase so much that @xmath167 enters the optical band and changes the shape of the sed .",
    "however , several simulations have shown that the light curves do not show prominent rebrightening even if the blast - wave encounters an enhancement of density ( nakar & granot 2007 , gat et al .",
    "+ we therefore conclude that a single component fs model can not explain the grb100814a observed behaviour . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss a few multi - component models to interpret the behaviour of the afterglow of this burst .      in this model , the prompt emission ,",
    "the early optical and x - ray afterglow emission is produced by a wide outflow , while the late optical rebrightening is due to emission from a narrow jet seen off - axis .",
    "the emission from the latter is initially beamed away from the observer , however as the lorentz factor decreases , more and more flux enters the line of sight .",
    "such a scenario has been already invoked @xcite to explain late optical rebrightening features , so in principle it could explain the behaviour of grb100814a .",
    "we note that granot et al .",

    "grb100814a does not belong to such categories , having a peak energy above 100 kev .",

    "+ in the following , we shall be using the formulation of @xcite ( hereafter sm00 ) to predict the temporal evolution of the flux due to fs and rs .",
    "we assume that the circumburst medium density @xmath164 decreases with radius as @xmath243,where @xmath160 is the radius reached by the shocks , while the mass @xmath244 of the late ejecta which pile up with the trailing shells obeys @xmath245 , where @xmath184 is the lorentz factor of these late shells .",

    "the energy of the blast wave increases with time as @xmath247 , where @xmath248 is linked to the parameter @xmath246 ( zhang et al .",
    "we note that sm00 take the approximation of a constant density throughout the shell crossed by the rs and do not take into account the @xmath249 ( where @xmath145 stands for pressure and @xmath250 the element of volume ) work produced by the hot gas ( uhm  2011 ) .",
    "changes in the density and mechanical work should be taken into consideration in a more realistic scenario ; we do that using numerical simulations ( see below ) .",
    "however , this formulation enables us to use relatively easy closure relations that link the spectral and decay slopes to the parameter @xmath246 of energy injection and the density profile @xmath251 of the surrounding medium . at 4500  s , we assume @xmath252 , ( where @xmath253 is the frequency of optical bands ) since @xmath254 would imply an implausible index @xmath165 for the energy distribution of the electrons that produce the rs emission , @xmath255 .",
    "we also assume that the x - ray band is above the cooling frequency of the fs emission , i.e. @xmath256 . to have spectral indices consistent with those observed , we assume @xmath257 and @xmath258 for the forward and the reverse shock respectively .",
    "these values of @xmath165 would lead to spectral indexes @xmath259 and @xmath260 , which are within @xmath261 of the spectral parameters obtained when fitting the various seds . we find that a uniform medium , @xmath262 , can not explain both the x - ray and early optical decay slopes",
    "in fact , the amount of energy injection which would make the x - ray decay match the observed value produces too shallow an optical decay .",
    "conversely , less energy injection , which would make the optical match the observation , would produce too steep an x - ray decay .",

    "if we extrapolate the peak time - peak frequency trend to x - ray frequencies , the peak time of the x - ray emission should have been observed several hundreds of seconds after the trigger ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "this agrees with observations , since the x - ray plateau appears to have started at that epoch .",
    "finally , such a long lived rs scenario would produce a bright radio emission ; radio observations started a few days after the trigger and managed to detect a measurable radio flux ( see section [ radio ] ) .    however , a more serious issue we have yet to consider is whether @xmath241 can be in the optical band as late as @xmath277  ks .",
    "we compute the value of @xmath200 from 860  s , the earliest epoch when the emission of the fs shock is recorded .",

    "such large energy is not predicted by any models of the grb central engine .",
    "a more plausible variant of the previous model , which also keeps all the advantages described above , predicts that all the emission in the x - ray band is also produced by the rs , with @xmath284 , while the fs produces the rebrightening . in this case",

    "all these values are within @xmath294 of the observed values , except the rise , which is slightly steeper than predicted , and decay slope after the rebrightening , which is slower than predicted .",

    "+ we point out that our numerical simulations have confirmed the basic scenario drawn from the analytical model . in order to have the x - ray emission and the optical rebrightening produced by fs , with @xmath241 crossing the optical band as late as @xmath354  day and @xmath445",
    ", one needs either an extreme value of kinetic energy imparted to the whole bulk of the emitting medium , or a more realistic value of kinetic energy somehow imparted only to a tiny fraction of the medium .",

    "we shall now briefly discuss other possible scenarios to explain the behaviour of grb100814a , in connection with other grbs showing the same phenomenology .      the fact that the rebrightening is not visible in the x - ray requires strong _ ad hoc _ assumptions regarding the evolution of these parameters , which makes the whole scenario contrived and implausible ( panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 ; see , however , filgas et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the rebrightening is produced when the energy injection , in form of late shells which pile up on the leading ones , ends , and bright fs and rs reverberate throughout the ejecta themselves ( zhang & mszros 2002 , vlasis et al .",
    "2011 ) . before and after the rebrightening ,",
    "the emission comes only from fs of the leading shell .",
    "+ it has been found that the rebrightening is prominent , as in the case of 100814a , only if the ejecta are collimated .",
    "this would explain why we see , shortly after the rebrightening , a jet break and why the break times are not simultaneous .",
    "the spectral evolution observed during the rebrightening can be explained if we assume that a rs spectrum , with its peak frequency crossing the optical band , is outshining the fs emission .",

    "however , we have no radio observations at the epoch of the optical peak , so this prediction could not be tested .",
    "the late radio peak , which occurred @xmath446 times later than the optical peak , was likely due to the behaviour of critical frequencies and dynamics .",
    "we shall now discuss the possibility that the optical emission of grb100814a is not being produced by external shocks , but it is an outcome of dissipation processes occurring inside the ejecta themselves .",
    "+ first , optical flares may have already been found in grb afterglows ( roming et al .",
    "2006 , swenson et al .",
    "2013 , kopa et al . 2013 ) and at least some of them are likely to be produced by internal dissipation processes , like their x - ray counterparts",
    ". therefore , internal dissipation processes could generate late optical emission in grbs .",
    "second , in addition to grb100814a , other events like grb081029 ( nardini et al .",
    "2011 ; holland et al .",
    "2012 ) and grb100621a ( greiner et al . 2013 ) show sudden optical rebrightening towards the end of the x - ray slow decay phase .",
    "another similarity to the case of grb100814 is that the x - ray light curves of these grbs do not seem to be altered much during the optical rebrightening : the flux in this higher energy band does not exhibit any clear analog rise .",
    "a difference is that , in these events , the rise of the optical flux is much steeper than in 100814a , approaching @xmath447 .",
    "furthermore , there is spectral variability and , sometimes , rapid temporal variability during the rebrightening itself . + while a complicated distribution of lorentz factor of the shells can reproduce slopes steeper than those detected for grb100814a , it may be nevertheless difficult to explain such extreme slopes and variability in the context of external shock mechanism . now , if what we see in grb100814a is only a  mild \" version of the same phenomenon registered in other grbs , one may thus need to abandon the external shock scenarios and study the behaviour in the context of internal dissipation models , in which fast variability is allowed by high bulk lorentz factors .",
    "the x - ray afterglow of grb100814a is among the brightest of any observed by _ swift _ during the end of the plateau phase ( see fig.[ag_lc.eps ] ) . according to panaitescu & verstrand ( 2011 ) , the x - ray afterglow of bursts with chromatic behaviour is on average brighter than that of bursts",
    "that do not show it .",
    "this might indicate that in these events the origin of at least the x - ray emission is not from the fs , but some other mechanism , such as internal dissipation .",
    "+ a drawback of this scenario is that we do not yet understand well the behaviour of the internal dissipation emission .",
    "thus , such identification is rather _ ad hoc _ , and not much susceptible to testing .",
    "the chromatic behaviour at the optical rebrightening of grb100814a is not clearly accounted for , nor is the late steep decay similar to that observed in the x - rays .",
    "we have reduced and examined an ample set of data on grb100814a , observed by @xmath97 , @xmath448 , and several ground optical and radio facilities .",
    "a prominent feature of this burst is an optical rebrightening , starting around @xmath449  ks after the burst trigger , which follows a typical early phase of slow decay of the flux .",
    "such a rebrightening is not present in the x - ray light curve .",
    "however , when the optical rebrightening gives way to a steep decay , the x - ray light curve shows a break and a steepening as well .",
    "the radio emission , instead , peaks around @xmath4  s. + the optical rebrightening has a chromatic behaviour .",
    "this is already evident in the analysis of light curves ; furthermore , a study of the spectral energy distributions shows a possible spectral break in the optical band , which is consistent with the transit of the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath200 through it .",
    "+ we have discussed a few models to interpret the behaviour of grb100814a .",
    "the first model theorizes a double component jet ; initially , both x - ray and optical emission are produced by a wide outflow component , seen just off - axis .",
    "a narrow component produces the optical rebrightening when its emission enters the line of sight of the observer . while this model can reproduce the temporal behaviour observed , the occurrence of a spectral break in the optical band at @xmath450 day after the trigger would require an unphysical value of kinetic energy .",
    "+ a second model assumes that the observed emission is a combination of a long - lived rs , caused by continuous energy injection in the form of late shells , and fs . for a configuration of the circumburst medium density profile and strength of energy injection ,",
    "simple analytical calculations show that the x - ray emission and the optical rebrightening can be attributed to fs , while the rs produces the early optical shallow decay .",
    "the late steepening is due to a jet break .",
    "this model explains why the x - ray light curve shows no sign of the flux rebrightening seen in the optical , while it breaks to a steeper decay at an epoch similar to that of the optical .",
    "however , this model has again difficulty in explaining the presence of @xmath200 crossing the optical band during the optical peak since it requires a very high value of energy @xmath342 of the ejecta . + more detailed , numerical calculations based on the the modeling of uhm et al .",
    "( 2012 ) indicate that the general behaviour can be described with the interplay of fs and rs , and more reasonable values of energy .",
    "furthermore , this numerical modeling enables us to constrain how the lorentz factor of the shells emitted by the grb central engine evolves in time , thus shedding light on the still poorly known physics of this object . on the other hand , in the case at hand",
    ", one would require that the fs accelerates only @xmath451 of the electrons of the surrounding medium , which may be difficult to explain .",
    "+ a variant of this model which keeps its advantages and sidesteps its problem is one in which all the emission , both in the x - ray and optical , is actually due to rs , while the optical bump is due to the emergence of a fs component with steep spectrum . in this case",
    ", a very high value of energy is not needed : @xmath452 erg after correction for beaming .",
    "furthermore , this model predicts the correct optical post - jet break slopes if one assumes that the jet edge effect produces decay slopes similar to those expected for jets with sideways expansion .",
    "+ the interplay between fs and rs emission may explain other grbs that have an optical bump and chromatic behaviour . for different strengths of energy injection and density profile of the medium , a variety of behaviours , either chromatic or achromatic , can be reproduced .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain events which have a steep optical rebrightening with external shock scenarios .",
    "this is especially true when rapid flux fluctuations are present at the top of the rebrightening , for example in grb081029 or grb10621a .",
    "therefore , a possibility we can not exclude is that either or both the x - ray and optical emission are due to some internal dissipation mechanism .",
    "+ grb100814a belongs to the growing family of events whose afterglow can not be explained by a simple component fs emission , but requires a superposition of more components , either produced by different regions of the ejecta or due to different blast waves .",
    "this category of events includes bursts with chromatic behaviour and rebrightenings at the end of the slow decline phase such as grb100814a .",
    "detailed temporal and spectral analyses of multi - wavelength data is needed in order to test the different scenarios , identify and characterize the different components present in afterglows .",
    "thankfully , the combination of _ swift _ and ground based facilities allows observers to produce an ample and extended coverage of grbs and shed light on their complex and intriguing behaviour .",
