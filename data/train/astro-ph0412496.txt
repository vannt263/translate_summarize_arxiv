    "there is growing evidence that at least some active galactic nuclei ( agn ) display periodic behavior on a timescale of years or decades .",
    "the observational evidence consists largely of periodicities in optical or radio light curves or periodic variations in the parsec - scale radio cores mapped by vlbi .",
    "perhaps the best documented case study is that of the bl lac object oj287 for which a period of 11.6 year was found in the visible light curve @xcite .",
    "this periodicity was confirmed by observations of a predicted outburst in 1994 @xcite but with a one year delay between the optical and radio peaks @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the observed periodicity is due to the sweeping of a relativistic beam aligned normal to a precessing accretion disk surrounding a supermassive black hole .",
    "@xcite suggest a binary black hole model in which the secondary orbit penetrates the accretion disk of the primary , causing a thermal ( optical ) pulse , followed by enhanced accretion and increased particle flux in the relativistic jet , which is responsible for the time - delayed radio flare .    precessing relativistic beams",
    "have also been invoked to explain the undulating jet structures in several compact radio sources , including 1928 + 738 @xcite , 0153 + 744 @xcite , and 4c12.50 @xcite .",
    "@xcite interpreted the strongly bent relativistic jet in pks 0420 - 014 as evidence for a binary black hole system which precesses on a timescale @xmath0  10 yr . @xcite analyzed eight superluminal jet components of the parsec - scale radio quasar 3c273 observed over the last 30 yr .",
    "they suggest that the observed velocities and position angles can be interpreted by ejection of synchrotron - radiating shocks moving outward in ballistic trajectories from the base of a precessing inner jet whose period is 16 yr .",
    "these observations provide _ post facto _ evidence for precession in the central engines of agn i.e. , the observed jet morphology is interpreted as a record of the putative jet motion , but the jet oscillation itself has not been observed . however , in a recent paper @xcite report that they have directly detected periodic changes in the parsec - scale radio jet orientation of the eponymous agn bl lacertae based on analysis of two independent datasets : periodic variations in the polarization position angle at 1 mm wavelength , and in the direction of the innermost radio core component in 43  ghz vlbi maps . in the latter case , they find strong evidence of periodicity with a timescale of @xmath1 yrs and an angular amplitude of @xmath2 . the vlbi maps spanned 23 epochs over the time range 1997.58  2001.28 .",
    "they modeled the source brightness at each epoch using a variable number of elliptical gaussian components , including a two closely - spaced ( @xmath3 mas ) circular gaussian subcomponents in the core .",
    "the model component parameters were adjusted for a best - fit to the observed brightness distribution .",
    "they found a periodic variation in the core ` structural position angle ' ( spa ) , defined as the relative position angle between the two closely spaced core subcomponents .",
    "this paper reports results from a series of 43  ghz vlbi observations of bl lac using very similar observing parameters during an overlapping time range ( 1998.73  2003.82 ) .",
    "although the primary purpose of the observations was rather different ( monitoring the magnetic field structure of the radio jet , mutel & denn , 2004 _ in prep .",
    "_ ) , the resulting maps are of comparable quality to those of @xcite and provide an independent test of the precession hypothesis .",
    "the observations were performed at regular @xmath00.3 year intervals during nine epochs between 1998.76 and 2002.05 and a tenth epoch at 2003.82 using the 10-element very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "the observations consisted of a series of short scans at each of three observing frequencies ( 15.4 , 22.2 , 43.2  ghz ) of bl lac and three other agn sources in sequence for 12 hours .",
    "we recorded both left and right circular polarization at each telescope and correlated all four cross - correlations pairs ( rr , ll , rl , and lr ) for each baseline . the data were recorded in standard vlba mode using 128  mhz bandwidth and 1-bit sampling .    prior to self - calibration",
    ", all fringe - fitting and visibility calibration was done using the astronomical imaging processing system ( aips , * ? ? ?",
    "we performed amplitude calibration using the aips automated calibration transfer system @xcite .",
    "fringe fitting of the parallel ( rr , ll ) and cross - hand ( rl , lr ) polarization correlations , as well as removal of instrumental polarization were done using the scheme described in @xcite .",
    "hybrid mapping was done in aips and with the caltech hybrid mapping program difmap @xcite .",
    "the resulting stokes i maps had typical rms noise level @xmath4 mjy per beam at 43  ghz .",
    "figure 1 shows a comparison of 43  ghz contour maps of bl lac observed by @xcite at epoch 1999.12 and our map 14 days later ( epoch 1999.16 ) . in both maps , eleven component best - fit elliptical gaussian brightness models",
    "are shown overlaid by crosses and circles .",
    "the maps are very similar , both in dynamic range and angular resolution , as might be expected given the similarity in observing equipment and close proximity in time .",
    "however , there are small but statistically significant differences in the gaussian component locations and sizes , which might reflect real differences in structure over 14 days , but could also be partially explained by subtle differences in the model fitting algorithms used ( brandeis vlbp package , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) versus ( difmap , * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the close similarity in image quality and resolution of the two datasets confirms that the present data comprise a comparable but independent test of the claim for periodic behavior in the inner core .",
    "gaussian component modeling of the inner core structure is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "figure 2@xmath5 shows the full 43  ghz hybrid map of bl  lac at epoch 1999.73 , while figure 2@xmath6 is a magnified view of the core only .",
    "the innermost part of the core was fit with three circular gaussian components labeled c1 , c2 , and c3 .",
    "the structural position angle ( spa ) is defined as the position angle between the two innermost components c1 and c2 .",
    "it is this orientation angle that @xcite find exhibits periodic variation which they interpret as evidence for core precession .",
    "note that the c1-c2 separation is only @xmath7% of the restoring beam dimension along the structural position angle ( lower left ellipse ) .",
    "hence , the inner core substructure is not well resolved , which makes the gaussian component decomposition non - unique . to check the reliability of the spa determination",
    ", both @xcite and us also fitted a single elliptical gaussian component to the innermost core for each epoch .",
    "the resulting major axis orientation is compared with the spa orientation using the c1-c2 position angle in table 1 .",
    "the differences are less than the uncertainties in the position angle determination , indicating that although the angular resolution of the 43  ghz maps is inadequate to determine details of the inner core substructure , the orientation of the inner core is probably accurately determined by gaussian component modeling .",

    "the resulting self - calibrated maps are displayed for visual inspection with the @xmath48 value of each set of model components .",
    "we used difwrap to vary the separation and spa of the core subcomponents c1 and c2 in steps of 0.02 mas and 5@xmath49 respectively , followed by self - calibration and model fitting for each set of c1-c2 positions .",
    "we generated a sequence of hybrid maps corresponding to gridded values of separation and spa over the ranges 0.02 to 0.20 mas and 180@xmath49 to 240@xmath49 respectively .",
    "at each epoch , the map corresponding to the minimum @xmath48 value was differenced from each of the other maps . in order to determine the uncertainties in the separation and spa of the c1-c2 component pair",
    ", we adopted the heuristic criterion that the rms noise level of the differenced map associated with a particular core separation and spa did not increase by more than 50% from the lowest value for any map .",

    "the acceptance probability of the combined dataset to the best - fit periodic model ( @xmath65 ) is only marginally better than that of the rescaled @xcite dataset alone ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "however , even with the relatively large uncertainties of the present spa data , would a different set of measurements been able to falsify the periodic model of @xcite ? in order to test this , we randomly reassigned the epochs of our ten spa measurements and calculated the goodness of fit to the @xcite model .",

    "a more critical question is whether the combined dataset provides convincing evidence for ( or against ) periodic spa variations .",
    "since the combined dataset spans less than two periods with adequate sampling intervals ( 1998.23 - 2002.05 ) , it is difficult to to make strong case for periodicity as opposed to episodic variations .",
    "if the variations are regular and periodic , measurement of spa orientations over a longer timescale provides a critical test of periodicity .",
    "we can use the three epochs observed since the last spa measurement of @xcite ( epochs 2001.60 , 2002.05 , 2003.82 ) to test periodic models . a @xmath48 goodness of fit analysis of these three measurements using the periodic model of @xcite and the best - fit model in table  2 results in acceptance probabilities @xmath68 i.e. , rejection of the model at slightly less than @xmath56 confidence .",
    "while this result is not definitive , it calls into doubt the periodic nature of the spa variations",
    ".    if the inner core of bl  lac is precessing , one might expect periodic variations in the radio flux , since the relativistically beamed jet emission will be strongly modulated by the line of sight angle .",
    "the doppler - boosted flux will depend on the lorentz factor of the emission region and its angle to the observer s line of sight .",

    "lac is nearly always a flat spectrum source ( @xmath79 ) , so the expected flux ratio over one precession cycle ranges from 1.1 ( @xmath80 ) to 2.5 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "@xcite used their kinematic model for bl  lac and obtained similar results .",
    "@xcite have recently reported detection of quasi - periodic variations in the radio flux of bl  lac .",
    "they analyzed 20 years of synoptic radio flux measurements at 4.8 , 8.4 , and 14.5  ghz from the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) using a cross - wavelet transform algorithm .",
    "they report significant frequency - dependent peaks : 1.4 yr ( 4.8  ghz ) , 3.7 yr ( 8.4  ghz ) and multiple periods ( 0.7 , 1.6 , and 3.5 yr ) at 14.5  ghz .",

    "they analyzed multi - frequency radio observations from 4.6 to 37  ghz using several statistical methods suitable for unevenly spaced samples .",
    "although they found that radio outbursts tend to repeat every @xmath82 years , there is no evidence for flux modulation at the proposed precession period .",
    "the non - detection of flux periodicity at the precession period is not necessarily a serious objection to the precession hypothesis since a large fraction of the total radio flux arises from the extended jet which clearly does not systematically vary in position angle ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
