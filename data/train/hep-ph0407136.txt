    "this state has been reported with a mass of @xmath18 mev@xcite .",
    "it has been observed in the reaction @xmath19 near threshold with quantum numbers @xmath20@xcite .",
    "this implies that it can not be described as a @xmath0 state , being therefore an exotic meson .",
    "its quantum numbers can be easily obtained as a tetraquark made of four light quarks coupled to @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "our model predicts for this configuration an energy of @xmath24 mev , in excellent agreement with the experimental data .",
    "let us emphasize that in the tetraquark calculation there are no free parameters , all of them being fixed in the @xmath12 interaction and hadron spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "babar has reported a narrow state near 2317 mev known as @xmath26@xcite with quantum numbers @xmath27 .",
    "its identification with a conventional @xmath28 quark state appears not possible due to its low mass@xcite .",
    "our results for the scalar @xmath28 member of the @xmath29wave triplet is 2470 mev , too heavy to be identified with the @xmath26 .",
    "this state has been observed in a strong or electromagnetic decay to @xmath30 so it must at least contains @xmath31 and @xmath32 quarks .",
    "the most obvious possibility of a tetraquark will be @xmath33 coupled to @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "we have obtained for this configuration 2449 mev for the isovector case and 2503 mev for the isoscalar state .",
    "although they are still too heavy to be identified with the @xmath25 , different alternatives could improve the situation .",
    "the first one is a possible @xmath36 coupling . in this case if the mixing is fitted to reproduce the mass of the @xmath26 we obtain a 55% @xmath28 component and another isoscalar state with a mass of 2655 mev , compatible with the recently discovered @xmath37 state at selex@xcite .",
    "a different approach was proposed by barnes _",
    "et al _ @xcite considering a possible isospin mixing . in our case",
    "we can fit this mixing to obtain the experimental energy , predicting an isospin symmetry breaking ( 58.5% for the i=1 component ) and an orthogonal state with a mass of 2635 mev .",
    "although its mass is also close to the one found by selex this strong isospin mixing is difficult to be justified within a @xmath11 interaction .",
    "another possibility would be the influence of three - body color forces@xcite , once included one can obtain the mass of the @xmath26 fitting its strength .",
    "the most recent of the states discovered in the charm sector is the @xmath3 , which was reported by belle@xcite with a mass of @xmath38 mev .",
    "one of its most interesting features is that its energy is within the error bars of the @xmath39 threshold , @xmath40 mev . considered as a @xmath41 state the most probable assignment would be a @xmath42wave , however most of the quark models predict a somewhat lower mass@xcite .",
    "our model does not predict any @xmath0 state compatible with this energy . due to our tetraquark formalism",
    "we can only describe positive parity states@xcite , so we have studied the @xmath43 with @xmath44=@xmath45 .",
    "we have obtained 3455 mev for the @xmath46 and 3786 mev for the @xmath34 , both too light to be identified with the @xmath3 .",
    "we have tried the same approaches than in the previous case , but all of them would predict an state with an energy below 3.4 gev which has not been observed .",
    "this seems to indicate that the @xmath3 can not be described as a tetraquark with @xmath47 .",
    "let us note that negative parity tetraquarks are always heavier than those with positive parity , so they seem to be more suitable candidates to describe this state .",
    "the light scalar sector can not be described assuming only a @xmath0 structure .",
    "our model predicts a pure light content for the @xmath48 , what contradicts some of the observed decays , and an @xmath49 too light .",
    "furthermore the @xmath50 and the @xmath51 can not be found for any combination of the parameters of the model .",
    "we have focussed our study in the @xmath48 and the @xmath52 as a tetraquark with a structure @xmath14 .",
    "we obtain 1167 mev for the isovector case and 1169 mev for the isoscalar state with a quark content consistent with their experimental decays@xcite .",
    "this implies that these states are automatically degenerated if we consider a tetraquark structure .",
    "the coupling with @xmath53 states or the inclusion of three - body color forces should help to improve these results .",

    "<S> the @xmath11 interaction used in this work has been derived from a complete study of the meson spectra from the light pseudoscalars to bottomonium@xcite , compatible with the description of @xmath12 data and the baryon spectra . to solve the four body problem </S>",
