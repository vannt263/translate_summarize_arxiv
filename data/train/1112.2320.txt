    "due to increasing interest in electronics and optoelectronics , among the wide - band - gap semiconductors , tio@xmath1 and sno@xmath1 are being considered as the most promising materials in view of their unique properties and various future technological applications .",
    "these applications boast their moderate price , high - volume , nontoxicity and chemical stability .",
    "in addition , these materials offer the possibility of integrating their magnetic and electronic properties in spintronic devices by using both the spin and the charge of electrons @xcite .",
    "tio@xmath1 is a very interesting and versatile material with a wide range of applications , including use in microelectronics due to its high dielectric constant and in optical coatings due to its high refractive index r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8 .",
    "it also has excellent optical transmittance in the visible and the near - infrared regions .",
    "tio@xmath1 exists in three crystalline polymorphs : rutile , anatase , and brookite with band gap values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ev , respectively @xcite . among the different tio@xmath1 polymorphs ,",
    "anatase ( tetragonal , @xmath9 ) is a metastable phase that contains four shared edges per octahedron ( the highest condensation of tio@xmath10 octahedra ) and is known to be useful for photocatalysis with response to ultraviolet photons .",
    "the rutile ( tetragonal , @xmath11 ) is the thermodynamically most stable phase at all temperatures and is formed by sharing two edges per octahedron ( the lowest condensation of tio@xmath12 octahedra ) with the largest index of refraction .",
    "the brookite ( orthorhombic , @xmath13 ) is the most distorted phase and shares three edges per octahedron .",
    "the properties of tio@xmath1 significantly depend on the crystalline phases , i.e. , anatase , rutile , or brookite , and on the morphology of the material @xcite .    on the other hand , tin dioxide ( sno@xmath1 )",
    "has been investigated in the view of potential technological applications in catalysis , gas sensor technology , etc .",
    "@xcite because of the high carrier density , optical transparency , wideband gap ( @xmath14 ev ) , and remarkable chemical and thermal stabilities .",
    "sno@xmath1 exists in the most important form of the crystalline phase , known as cassiterite , with a rutile ( tetragonal , @xmath11 ) structure .",
    "another form of sno@xmath1 with an orthorhombic structure is known to be stable only at high pressures and temperatures .",
    "many deposition techniques ( pulsed laser deposition , sol - gel deposition , etc . ) have been employed to synthesize tio@xmath1 and sno@xmath1 thin films , although magnetron sputtering remains the preferred method due to its better coating uniformity , process versatility , large - area coating capability and more freedom in selecting the deposition conditions @xcite .",
    "any mechanism that affects the lattice structure of the tio@xmath1 and the sno@xmath1 systems also influences their electronic structures and optical properties .",
    "swift heavy ion ( shi ) irradiation is one of the mechanisms that have been used to tailor the material properties by modifying its electronic structure @xcite .",
    "radiation - induced defects produced in the material are well documented to depend entirely upon the energy loss processes , namely , nuclear energy loss ( elastic process ) , and electronic energy loss ( inelastic process ) , involved during the passage of ions through the target material . in the high - energy region , due to dense electronic excitations , shis induce point / cluster / columnar defects and structural disorder , depending upon the extent of the electronic energy loss mechanism in the system .",
    "previous studies on the tio@xmath1 and the sno@xmath1 systems only focused on the shi - induced modifications in the electronic structure , orbital anisotropy and magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "thus , other properties , such as the optical properties , need further study .",
    "this experimental study was conducted to observe the changes in the optical transmittance , absorption and band gaps of tio@xmath1 and sno@xmath1 thin films irradiated with a 200-mev ag@xmath0 ion beam at various irradiation fluences ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ions/@xmath17 which is different from what is largely reported .",
    "pure titanium ( ii ) oxide ( tio ) and sno@xmath18 compounds ( purity 99.9% ) were used as the starting materials for the depositions of the thin films .",
    "tio@xmath18 and sno@xmath18 films , approximately @xmath19-nm thick , were deposited on cleaned sapphire single - crystal substrates by using a rf magnetron sputtering technique .",
    "the pure oxide materials were ground into a fine powder in an agate mortar ; then , mixtures were pressed in the form of circular targets of @xmath20 mm in diameter by applying a pressure of @xmath21 tons in a hydraulic press .",
    "the targets were sintered at @xmath22c for @xmath23 h. prior to filling the chamber with sputtering gas , it was evacuated to a base pressure of @xmath24 torr by using a turbo - molecular pump .",
    "the deposition was carried out in a partial pressure of @xmath25 mtorr of an oxygen and ar gas mixture ( 1:1 ) , keeping the substrate temperature at @xmath26c and rf power at @xmath27 w. after deposition , the films were annealed in - situ at @xmath28c in oxygen for @xmath29 h. the deposited thin films were irradiated with 200-mev ag@xmath0 ions at fluences of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ions/@xmath33 at room temperature ( rt ) by using the 15ud tandem accelerator at the inter - university accelerator center , new delhi , india .",

    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the pristine tio@xmath1 film exhibits a transmittance value of about 25% in the visible region at @xmath40 nm .",
    "with increasing irradiation ( shi : @xmath41 ions/@xmath17 ) fluence , the transmittance increases considerably , which at highest fluence ( shi : @xmath16 ions/@xmath17 ) acquires a value of @xmath42 70% .",
    "the increase in the transmittance with increasing shi fluence signifies that the transparency of the shi - irradiated tio@xmath1 films is superior to that of the pristine film . on the other hand ,",
    "the pristine sno@xmath43 film exhibits a systematic decrease in the transmittance with increasing irradiation ( shi : @xmath44 ions/@xmath17 ) fluence . in the visible region ,",
    "the transmittance for the pristine sno@xmath1 film was @xmath42 50% and decreased to @xmath4235% for the highest shi fluence .",
    "moreover , at @xmath45 nm , the transmittance decreases quickly for all samples for both the oxides materials and approaches zero at @xmath46 nm .",
    "this fast decrease in the transmittance is due to strong absorption of light in this region caused by the excitation and the migration of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band .",
    "typical oscillations in the transmittance spectra , particularly for sno@xmath1 , may be due to interference of light transmitted through the thin film and the substrate @xcite .",
    "previous studies @xcite revealed that the irradiated tio@xmath1 thin films for the highest shi fluence exhibited a mixed ( dominating brookite + rutile ) phase of tio@xmath1 while the sno@xmath1 pristine film was composed of a pure orthorhombic phase of sno@xmath1 , and shi - induced controlled structural disorder ( distortion in the sno@xmath12 octahedra ) and/or strain in the films .",
    "the dominating structure of the brookite phase in the shi - irradiated tio@xmath1 films and the orthorhombic distortions of the sno@xmath1 lattice could have important implications for the electronic structure and possible optical properties .",
    "therefore , the observed changes in the transmittance of the pristine tio@xmath1 and sno@xmath1 films with shi fluence can be attributed to tio@xmath12 and sno@xmath12 octahedral distortions , respectively .",

    "an anomalous trend was observed for the optical absorption edges and the suppression in the maximum absorption with increasing shi fluence for both the oxide materials .",
    "the absorption spectra of both systems reveal that the films grown under the same parametric conditions have low absorbance in the visible / near - infrared region while the absorbance is high in the ultraviolet region . since shi induces a controlled structural disorder ( tio@xmath12 and sno@xmath12 octahedral distortions ) in both the systems , modifications in the absorption spectra can be correlated to changes in the electronic structure as a result of a lowering in the orbital symmetry ( i.e. , its @xmath55- , @xmath56- , and @xmath57-like character ) via strong hybridization effects after irradiation .",

    "table [ tab1 ] shows the variations in the band gap energy with irradiation fluence for both the tio@xmath1 and the sno@xmath1 systems .",
    "hrxrd data indicate that shis create controlled structural disorder in the lattices of oxide materials",
    ". this can be responsible for the generation of defect levels near the conduction band , i.e. , shallow energy levels , which can give rise to a transition from the valence band to those levels instead of band - to - band transitions .",
    "due to the shallow levels , the band gap is effectively changed .",
    "this decrease in the band gap gives an indication of the stoichometric deviation of the irradiated sno@xmath1 and the increase in the oxygen vacancies in the sno@xmath1 lattice .",
    "a similar behavior was also reported in a previous work @xcite , where the effect of in - doping concentration on the optical band gap of nano - sno@xmath1 was investigated as a function of the calcination temperature .",
    "another possible explanation for the changes in the band gap value may be due to the fact that the density of surface states induced in the sno@xmath1 lattice is modified on irradiation .",
    "ions as functions of the ion energy inside tio@xmath1 and sno@xmath1 targets.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] +    the values of optical absorption edges obtained in our experiments are observed to deviate from the known values reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the obvious band gap energy changes of both oxide systems indicate the possibility of band gap engineering in the as - deposited thin films by means of shi irradiation . if the observed modifications in the optical properties are to be understood",
    ", an analysis of the possible implications of ion transport through the film is necessary .",
    "when 200-mev ag@xmath79 ions pass through the oxide films , they loses energy by collisions with nuclei ( nuclear stopping power s@xmath80 ) and inelastic collisions with electrons ( electronic stopping power s@xmath81 ) . in the present case , for a tio@xmath1 film , s@xmath82 kev / nm and s@xmath83 ev / nm while for a sno@xmath1 film , s@xmath81 @xmath84 kev / nm and s@xmath85 ev / nm as calculated by using stopping and range of ions in matter software @xcite .",
    "the vertical line marks a 200-mev incident ion energy , the energy used in the present work ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) . from these values , at higher energies , the electronic energy loss can be seen to dominate the nuclear energy loss , and at an energy of a few hundreds of kev , the opposite is true .",
    "thus , the inelastic electronic collision process is the dominant energy loss mechanism , which induces point and columnar defects and can lead to an increase in the defect density and to a modification in the lattice structure @xcite .",
    "in this study , the transmittance of the tio@xmath1 thin films increased with increasing shi fluence while the transmittance of the sno@xmath1 thin films decreased .",
    "both oxide systems showed improvements in the transmittance as the irradiation fluence was increased .",
    "an anomalous trend was observed for the optical absorption edges with increasing shi fluence for both the oxide materials . for irradiated tio@xmath1 thin films , the optical band gap values for the indirect transitions",
    "were shown to be much higher than the expected values reported .",
    "the highest value of the band gap was achieved in the sample shi - irradiated at a fluence of @xmath16 ions/@xmath17 while the lowest value of the band gap was observed in the pristine sample .",
    "a similar trend was observed in the irradiated sno@xmath1 samples .",
    "however , for the irradiated sno@xmath1 thin films , the band gap values on an average decreased .    from the results",
    ", we can conclude that shi does not critically affects the pristine tio@xmath1 samples while for sno@xmath1 , significant modifications in the optical properties are observed .",
    "these observed changes in the optical properties of both the pristine tio@xmath1 and sno@xmath1 films with shi fluence can be attributed to controlled structural disorder / defects in the system .",
