    "recent rapid progress of optical clocks has inspired various ideas of applications , attracting scientists outside the community of time and frequency standards .",
    "the community of geodesy is interested in optical clocks as detectors which are sensitive to a difference of gravitational potentials@xcite .",
    "scientists propose to hunt for topological dark matter using clocks @xcite .",
    "network of atomic clocks combined with a quantum communication technique may realize secure communication in global scale @xcite .",
    "realization of these applications practically depends on a frequency reference and a precision link to that reference .",
    "this is particulary the case when an optical clock behaves as a sensing device by measuring frequency difference from another reference .",
    "global navigation satellite system ( gnss ) allows us to obtain the international atomic time ( tai)@xcite even at isolated locations .",
    "while tai is normally used as a time scale , we can utilize it as a frequency reference of @xmath4 accuracy because the frequency of tai is , in most of the time , maintained according to the calibration served by cesium primary frequency standards .",
    "thus , commercial hydrogen masers ( h - masers ) with a satellite - based link to tai , which we call `` tai link '' hereafter , have often been employed in evaluating optical frequencies @xcite particularly in cases that the clock under test is developed or operated in laboratories where highly accurate primary frequency standards are not available .",
    "the uncertainty of optical frequency measurement based on the tai link has been limited at low @xmath5 level predominantly owing to the link uncertainty .",
    "while it is expected that the link uncertainty is reduced by the integration of signals , the measurements have not been extensive .",
    "in addition , the least uncertainties of absolute frequency measurements were at the @xmath5 level for long time , which hampered the rigorous validation of the frequency link at the @xmath6 level .",
    "following the advances of both optical clocks and cesium primary frequency standards in this decade , however , the latest absolute frequency measurements @xcite have uncertainties of the low @xmath6 level , which provides environments to confirm the validity of the tai link .    in this work",
    ", we extensively measured the absolute frequency of a @xmath0 lattice clock using the tai link .",
    "fourteen days of frequency measurements , @xmath7 s per day , together with the compensation of the linear drift of a local transfer oscillator have reduced the link uncertainty to tai down to @xmath8 .",
    "the resultant absolute frequency was consistent with other measurements performed in various institutes .",
    "lattice clock of fermionic strontium is one of the most popular optical frequency standards .",
    "more than five institutes have @xmath0 lattice clocks in operation to the best of our knowledge @xcite .",
    "the apparatus of the lattice clock at nict was briefly described in @xcite when our clock based on a vertically oriented one - dimensional lattice started its operation .",
    "various parts of the setup have been improved since then to operate more stably and to reduce systematic uncertainties .",
    "the intensity of the zeeman slower beam at 461 nm was increased more than twofold , allowing more atoms to be stably loaded to the lattice .",
    "the second stage cooling laser at 689 nm is now stabilized to a stable cavity made of ultralow expansion ( ule ) glass .",
    "a commercial ytterbium ( yb ) fiber comb which is stabilized to a h - maser was employed for the counting of optical frequencies .",
    "it is easier to achieve stable operation of long measurement time comparing with a ti - sapphire based frequency comb that we used previously .",
    "a ti - sapphire laser for the optical lattice is phase - stabilized to the nearest comb component .",
    "the clock laser is stabilized to a conventional cylindrical cavity of 10 cm length , which sits on a passive vibration isolation ( pvi ) platform .",
    "the spacer and mirror substrates are made of ule glass .",
    "while the simple cylindrical shape is susceptible to vertical vibration , the vertical vibration is detected by an accelerometer , and the corresponding frequency shift is substantially compensated by a feed - forward method .",
    "the spectrum of vibration shows a peak at the mechanical resonance of the pvi platform .",
    "the signal of this resonant component detected by the accelerometer is digitally band - pass filtered and the corresponding frequency shift is applied to an acousto optic modulator , through which the clock laser is delivered to atoms and the frequency comb .",
    "the short term instability was evaluated by beating against another clock laser for a @xmath9 ion clock @xcite where the vibration noise is suppressed in the same manner , resulting in a 1 s instability of @xmath10 per clock laser .",
    "note that a more elaborate feed - forward method was reported in @xcite .",
    "thanks to these improvements , a fourier - limited spectral width of 10 hz is stably obtained using a probe pulse width of 80 ms , which we employed for an alternative atomic servo to evaluate various systematic shifts . the stability of the frequency measurement , on the other hand , is limited by the reference h - maser .",
    "therefore , by reducing the probe pulse width to 50 ms , the measurement stability was not degraded but the digital stabilization to the atomic resonance was further secured .",
    "frequency measurement was performed by counting the frequency with reference to a h - maser , hm4 .",
    "the beat note between the 698 nm clock laser and the nearest comb component was sent to a zero dead time counter .",
    "the repetition frequency of the yb comb was stabilized to hm4 .",
    "the hm4 frequency is evaluated by a dual mixing time difference ( dmtd ) @xcite , which is a part of the japan standard time ( jst ) system . on every second ,",
    "the dmtd records the time difference of all h - masers and utc(nict ) , where utc(nict ) is the local realization of universal coordinated time ( utc ) at nict .",
    "note that the difference of utc and tai is just cumulated leap seconds .",
    "in other words , both have an identical frequency .",
    "table [ tbl : sys ] shows the systematic frequency shifts and uncertainties of the sr system .",
    "blackbody radiation causes the most significant frequency uncertainty similarly to other @xmath0 lattice clocks operated at room temperature .",
    "details of the systematic shifts are discussed as follows .",
    ".systematic shifts and uncertainties of the @xmath0 lattice clock [ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]     [ tbl : syslink ]    the uncertainty of the weighted mean ( right column ) was determined as follows . in terms of the strontium atom system , the statistical uncertainty is the standard deviation of the mean of the three points in fig .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of strontium system is derived from weighted mean of three systematic tables as the systematic uncertainty of the bbr varies in three campaigns and those are not random . on the other hand , some biases due to the link have characteristics of a statistical nature .",
    "thus , the uncertainty of the weighted mean would be less than that for one five - day evaluation",
    ". the bias due to the tidal effect was statistically averaged . according to eqn .",
    "( 25 ) in @xcite , the reduction of @xmath11 link uncertainty would be @xmath12 if three sets of 5(or 4)-day units are seamless . however three campaigns are separated in time in this case .",
    "therefore , three are assumed to be independent and we should adopt the factor @xmath13 for the case of three equal weights . the deviation from the equal weight",
    "mitigates this averaging effect to about 70% .",
    "the total uncertainty of @xmath14 is almost same as that of 5-day because it may include systematic bias of cs fountains . finally , the total uncertainty of our measurement was determined to be @xmath1 , and the absolute frequency of the@xmath0 lattice clock transition was concluded to be 429 228 004 229 872.85 ( 47 ) hz .",
    "figure 6 summarizes the record of absolute frequency measurements performed in various institutes worldwide .",
    "the result reported here is consistent with other measurements within the uncertainty , demonstrating the validity of the frequency measurement based on the tai link .",
    "in summary , the absolute frequency of the @xmath15 clock transition was evaluated with an uncertainty of @xmath1 using the tai link .",
    "three sets of five ( or four)-day measurements , where the frequency is measured for @xmath16 s per day , have reduced the uncertainty due to the frequency link between tai and lto . the uncertainty due to the measurement dead time",
    "is evaluated by numerical simulation .",
    "these efforts reduced the link uncertainty .",
    "the intermittent comparison of an optical clock frequency can be applied to the estimation of the tai frequency , similarly to the role played by microwave fountain standards .",
    "cesium or rubidium fountain frequency standards have so far contributed to the calibration of tai frequency by their continuous operation over 15 days or more .",
    "optical clocks combined with a stable lto may not require continuous operation as they reach the same level of instability in a few hours .",
    "while frequency link in principle requires the prolonged signal integration , the homogeneously distributed intermittent operation of optical clocks as well as the management of dead time error could be sufficient for the estimation of the tai frequency .",
    "such measurements simultaneously provide an alternative of the frequency link for optical clocks .",
    "link technique is always verified by a comparison with another independent method .",
    "the frequency evaluation investigated here may play a role in validating a novel link technique such as satellite - based transfer using two - way carrier phase @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the link uncertainty will enable certain applications of optical clocks that require the operation in the field or isolated locations .",
    "the authors thank f. nakagawa and h. ito for providing the record of jst .",
    "we are also grateful to y. hanado , m. kumagai , and t. gotoh for the discussion regarding the link uncertainty .",
