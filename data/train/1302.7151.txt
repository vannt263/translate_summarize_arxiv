    "the superlattice is ferromagnetic and metallic at low temperatures . for w",
    "= 5 , the onset temperature for ferromagnetism in the afi layer is near 0.05 , and simultaneously the resistivity start to decrease .",
    "the low - temperature resistivity increases monotonously with the afi layer width .",
    "an mit occurs beyond a threshold width similar as in the experiments by li _",
    "et al._@xcite who measured the variations in the resistivity in lcmo / pcmo superlattices for different widths of the pcmo layer .",
    "in addition , the inset in fig.8(b ) shows a hump in the resistivity for w = 9 and w = 7 at the ferromagnetic onset temperatures t@xmath166 0.04 and 0.05 , respectively , while there is no such hump in the bulk fm manganite ( see the dashed line of fig.8(b ) ) .",
    "the humps in the resistivity curves increase and shift to lower temperatures with increasing afi layer width ( for w @xmath167 9 ) .",
    "this trend agrees well with the lcmo / pcmo superlattice experiment@xcite with the exception of the experimentally observed hump in the bulk fm limit .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath165 near the mit in bulk fm manganites is tied to the presence of intrinsic inhomogeneities and disorder@xcite .",
    "here we have not included any disorder@xcite in the hamiltonian ; the mit in the fm / afi superlattice has a different origin .",
    "it is due to the induced onset of ferromagnetism in the afi layer .",
    "the natural next step is to explore the effect of an external magnetic field on the mit in the superlattice .",
    "fig.8(d ) shows that the resistivity for w = 11 is lowered by the magnetic field at low temperatures .",
    "the connection between the resistivity decrease and the onset of ferromagnetism in the afi layer is verified in fig.8(c ) .",
    "the mit for h = 0.004 is at t @xmath166 0.05 ; above this temperature , the resistivity is larger than the resistivity calculated for h = 0 .",
    "the magnetoresistance , @xmath168/\\rho(0)$ ] therefore changes sign near the onset temperature for ferromagnetism .    at higher temperatures",
    ", the t@xmath54 spins are randomly oriented .",
    "we recall that in the limit @xmath58 the @xmath59 electron spins are perfectly aligned along the local @xmath40 spin direction .",
    "so the current is equally carried by up - spin and down - spin electrons . in the presence of a weak external magnetic field , the number of @xmath59 electrons is increased in the up - spin channel only in the fm layers and the tunneling current from the down - spin channel is decreased .",
    "the up - spin channel in the afi layer remains unaltered and restricts the possible enhancement of the tunneling current from the up - spin channel .",
    "this results in an overall increase of the resistivity and a positive magnetoresistance .    at low temperatures in an external magnetic field",
    "the t@xmath54 spins in the afi layer tend to align in the same direction as the t@xmath54 spins in the fm layers .",
    "so the tunneling current in the down - spin channel decreases but it increases for the up - spin channel .",
    "this decreases the overall resistivity of the superlattice .",
    "the corresponding crossover of the magnetoresistance from negative to positive was indeed reported in la@xmath169ce@xmath170mno@xmath1/srtio@xmath1-nb@xcite and la@xmath171ca@xmath172mno@xmath1/srti@xmath173nb@xmath174o@xmath1@xcite heterojunctions .",
    "the z component of the t@xmath54 spins and the electron densities for each site in the superlattice are shown in fig.1(c ) for w = 11 and h = 0.004 .",
    "ferromagnetic and af structures coexist spatially separated in the afi layer .",
    "the ferromagnetic phase in the upper panel is directly connected to the charge disordered regions in the lower panel .",
    "a magnetic field h @xmath175 0.007 is required to tune the parent afi into a ferromagnetic metal .",
    "lower fields are instead required for the fm / afi superlattices which are therefore candidates to design materials with large magnetoresistance .",
    "in order to analyze the effect of the lrc interactions we examine the ferromagnetic structure factor s@xmath148(*0 * ) for @xmath159 in fig.9(a ) . the critical width , beyond which s@xmath148(*0 * ) starts to decrease , is w@xmath143 = 7 . with the lrc potentials , @xmath87 ,",
    "the critical width w@xmath143 = 5 , as discussed in section iv , is smaller due to the decrease in the average electron density in the afi layer which is evident in fig.7(a ) .",
    "all the discussions in the previous two sections remain qualitatively valid also for @xmath159 , but with a larger critical width w@xmath143 .",

    "similar to the results in fig.8(a ) , the onset temperature for ferromagnetism decreases with increasing w. fig.9(c ) shows the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity of the superlattice . for w = 13 and w = 15 ,",
    "the low - temperature resistivity rises by orders of magnitude .",
    "the inset of fig.9(c ) zooms into the mit at intermediate temperatures on a linear scale .",
    "the humps in @xmath165(t ) decrease and shift to higher temperatures for w @xmath176 11 .    the onset temperature of ferromagnetism is higher in the fm layers than the afi layers",
    "as becomes obvious from the temperature dependent structure factor in fig.9(d ) .",
    "so there are two ferromagnetic transitions in the superlattice : the first at t@xmath177 for ferromagnetism in the fm layers and the second for the global ferromagnetism at t@xmath178 @xmath176 t@xmath177 .",
    "the rise in the resistivity @xmath165 near the hump just below t@xmath177 is apparently due to the onset of ferromagnetism in the fm layers .",
    "the rise in @xmath165 is expected for the same reason as for positive magnetoresistance discussed in section v. the downturn in @xmath165 results from the onset of global ferromagnetism in the superlattices at t@xmath178 .",
    "these two transition temperatures are also observed in the lcmo / pcmo superlattices@xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic structure factor in the bulk fm state is included as the dotted line in fig.9(d ) .",
    "the ferromagnetic onset temperature for the fm layers in the fm / afi superlattices is lower than for the bulk .",
    "in this section we compare @xmath163 for different combinations of electron - phonon couplings @xmath124 and @xmath125 . in the previous sections",
    "@xmath124 = 1.5 and @xmath125 = 1.75 were chosen . if @xmath125 is kept fixed and @xmath124 varies between 1.0 and 1.6 , the groundstate is ferromagnetic and metallic in the bulk limit at @xmath0 .",
    "the induced magnetization in the afi layer changes little for @xmath181 and for different widths w ( see fig.10(a ) ) . for @xmath124 = 1.6 however ,",
    "@xmath163 is reduced for w @xmath175 5 .",
    "the difference results from the decrease in the electron density in the fm layers nearest to the interface as becomes evident from the comparison with the bulk phase at @xmath182@xcite . for @xmath181 ,",
    "the groundstate at @xmath182 is a ferromagnetic metal while it is a ce - type antiferromagnet for @xmath183 . for @xmath181 , the magnetization in the interfacial fm layers",
    "is not altered , even if the electron density decreases towards @xmath182 .",
    "but for @xmath184 , ferromagnetic order becomes unstable at the interfacial lines .",
    "the smaller magnetization at the interfacial fm layers decreases the induced magnetization in the afi layer for w @xmath175 5 .     for different combinations of @xmath124 and @xmath125 values at t = 0.01 .",
    "( b ) @xmath163 without ( @xmath185 ) and with ( @xmath186 ) quenched disorder , and with magnetically disordered interfaces ( mdis ) ( see text ) for @xmath103 and @xmath102 at t = 0.01 .",
    "the dotted line join the three points namely w = 1 ( for mdis ) , w = 5 ( for @xmath186 ) , and w = 9 ( for @xmath185).,width=330,height=151 ]    fig.10(a ) also indicates the reduced magnetization in the afi layer for the larger electron - phonon coupling @xmath187 , for which the afi layer recovers the af , charge ordered state at a smaller width w. it is therefore easier to induce a ferromagnetic moment in large - bandwidth ( small @xmath45 ) manganites . at @xmath18 ,",
    "the bandwidth of pcmo is the largest among those manganites for which an af , charge ordered insulating phase is experimentally observed@xcite .",
    "in fact , in most of the experimental fm / afi superlattices at @xmath18 the insulating manganite pcmo is used along with a variety of different fm manganites .",
    "the size mismatch of re and ae elements in the manganites re@xmath2ae@xmath188mno@xmath1 leads to tilting and distortions of the mno@xmath189 octahedra and variations in the local electronic parameters . the tilting and distortions of mno@xmath189 octahedra",
    "is generally known as a - type disorder .",
    "here we have neglected the intrinsic a - type disorder in both the fm and the afi manganites .",
    "their interface is more prone to disorder due to chemical intermixing , lattice mismatch , and a - type disorder .",
    "we test the effect of quenched binary disorder in the terminating line of the fm layers at the interface by adding the potential disorder term by @xmath190 to the hamiltonian .",
    "the sum over j is restricted to the terminating lines of the fm layers and @xmath191 is the quenched disorder potential with @xmath192 and values @xmath193@xmath194 .    in fig.10(b )",
    ", we show the induced magnetization in the afi layer for @xmath186 and different widths w , which apparently changes little between @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "all the discussions in the previous sections remain qualitatively unchanged for moderate disorder @xmath186 .",
    "the magnetization of the interfacial lines of the fm layers , where @xmath194 is included , is nevertheless likely to decrease for larger @xmath194 .",
    "ultimately the magnetization in those interfacial lines will be quenched due to spin disorder . in order to see the effect of the magnetically disordered interfaces on the afi layer we have fixed randomly oriented spins in the interfacial lines throughout the monte carlo simulations .",
    "indeed , in this extreme case , the induced magnetization in the afi layer is very small ( see fig.10(b ) ) , irrespective of the afi layer width .",
    "the magnetization of the fm layer at the interface is therefore crucial to induce the ferromagnetic moments in the afi layer .    in the experiments",
    "it is apparently not clear whether or not there are magnetically disordered interfaces on the fm sides in the fm / afi superlattices@xcite .",
    "thin afi layers are likely to be more susceptible to disorder due to strain effects .",
    "the disorder strength @xmath194 at the interface will therefore increase with decreasing the afi layer width ; the width dependence of the disorder strength is however hard to quantify . if we combine the results in fig.10(b ) such that disorder strength is maximum for smaller afi layers width and decreases thereafter for larger w ( see the dotted line ) then the magnetic moment in the afi layer behaves non - monotonically which agrees qualitatively with the lsmo / pcmo superlattice experiment@xcite . but more theoretical work is needed to understand this non - monotonic behaviour .",
    "we have investigated the magnetic and electronic properties of manganite superlattices at the specific electron density @xmath0 using a two - orbital double - exchange model including super - exchange interactions , jt distortions , and lrc interactions in 2d . at the interface electrons",
    "are transferred from the the fm to the afi manganites .",
    "friedel - like density oscillations are observed in both the fm and the afi layers . due to",
    "the charge transfer and the induced magnetization the smaller width af insulator sandwiched between fm manganites turns into a ferromagnetic metal at low temperatures .",
    "the induced magnetization in the afi layer decreases beyond a critical width and away from the interface the afi layer gradually returns to the bulk afi state .",
    "this results in an mit in the fm / afi superlattice driven by the afi layer width .",
    "only weak external magnetic field is required to tune the insulating into a metallic state .",
    "the sign of the magnetoresistance changes at higher temperatures .",
    "a remarkable result is that colossal magnetoresistance in manganite superlattices is achieved at lower magnetic fields as in the bulk phases of the constituent materials . for the range of afi layer widths ,",
    "at which fm / afi superlattices show a metallic behavior at low temperatures , a hump in the temperature dependence of the resistivity @xmath165 is observed .",
    "the hump in @xmath165 is due to the presence of two ferromagnetic transition temperatures in the superlattice .",
    "the height of the hump decreases and shifts to higher temperatures with decreasing afi layer width .    in summary",
    ", the width of the afi layers controls the magnitude of the magnetoresistance and the mit in the fm / afi superlattices .",
    "our 2d model hamiltonian calculations provide a basis for explaining the mit in manganite superlattices .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour of the induced ferromagnetic moment in the afi layer is traced to the effects of magnetic disorder at the interface .",
