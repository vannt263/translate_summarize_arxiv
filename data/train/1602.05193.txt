    "the asteroseismology of red giant stars has become a highlight of the corot and _ kepler _  space missions ( for general reviews see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one feature that has made these stars interesting , is the presence of non - radial oscillation modes that reveal properties of the stellar cores .",
    "the non - radial modes have a mixed nature , behaving like acoustic ( or p ) modes in the envelope with pressure acting as the restoring force , and as gravity ( or g ) modes in the core region with buoyancy being the restoring force ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the p- and g - mode cavities are separated by an evanescent zone , which the waves can tunnel through from either side .",
    "the exact p- and g-`mixture ' , or flavor , of a mixed mode depends on its frequency and spherical degree , @xmath0",
    ". modes with frequencies close to the acoustic resonant frequencies of the stellar envelope tend to be more p - mode like , while those far from the acoustic resonances are much more g - mode like .",
    "the latter therefore probe deeper into the stellar interior compared to the former .",
    "how much the flavor changes from mode to mode across the acoustic resonances depends on the overall coupling between the envelope and the core .",
    "the overall aspects of mode mixing in red giants arising from this coupling is well understood theoretically @xcite .",
    "observationally , the dipole modes ( @xmath1 ) have turned out to be particularly useful probes of the core because of their stronger coupling between core and envelope .",
    "the characterization of dipole mixed modes @xcite led to the discovery that red giant branch stars can be clearly distinguished from red clump stars @xcite , and to the detection of radial differential rotation @xcite .",
    "modes of higher spherical degree are also mixed , but the weaker coupling makes it difficult to observe the modes with strong g - mode flavor .",
    "the quadrupole modes ( @xmath2 ) we observe , and to a larger degree the octupole modes ( @xmath3 ) , are therefore on average more acoustic compared to the dipole modes , and hence less sensitive to the stellar core .    one particular observational result about the dipole modes posed an intriguing puzzle .",
    "the ensemble study of a few hundred _ kepler _  red giants by @xcite showed that a few dozen stars ",
    "about 20% of their sample  had significantly lower power in the dipole modes than ` normal ' stars .",
    "however , no significant suppression of higher degree modes was reported , leading to the conclusion only dipole modes were affected .",
    "recent theoretical work has proposed that the mechanism responsible for the mode suppression results in almost total trapping of the mode energy that leaks into the g - mode cavity @xcite .",
    "they put forward magnetic fields in the core region of the stars as the most plausible candidate for the suppression mechanism .",
    "this interpretation was further supported by the observation that mode suppression only occurs in stars above 1.1m@xmath4 , with an increasing fraction up to 50 - 60% for slightly more massive stars , all of which hosted convective cores during their main sequence phase ; strongly pointing to a convective core dynamo as the source of the mode suppressing magnetic field @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite focused their analysis on dipole modes .",
    "however , the theory by @xcite does allow one to predict the magnitude of the suppression for higher degree modes .",
    "agreement with observations of these modes would provide important support for the proposed mechanism . in this paper , we use 3.5 years of _ kepler _  data of over 3,600 carefully selected red giant branch stars to investigate the mode suppression in the non - radial modes of degree @xmath1 , 2 , and 3 , and compare theoretical predictions with our observed mode visibilities .",
    "we use the modules for experiments in stellar evolution ( mesa , release # 7456 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to compute stellar evolution models of low - mass stars from the zero age main sequence to the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "non - rotating models have been computed using an initial metallicity of @xmath5 with a mixture taken from @xcite and adopting the opal opacity tables @xcite .",
    "we calculate convective regions using the mixing - length theory with @xmath6 .",
    "the boundaries of convective regions are determined according to the schwarzschild criterion .",

    "we calculate @xmath13  and the frequency of maximum power , @xmath23 , using the scaling relations of @xcite and @xcite with the solar references values , @xmath13@xmath24@xmath25hz  and @xmath23@xmath26@xmath25hz .",
    "our initial selection of stars was based on the analysis by @xcite of 13,412 red giants from which we adopt their measurements of @xmath13  and @xmath23 , as well as their estimates of stellar mass based on the combination of those seismic observables with photometrically - derived effective temperatures using scaling relations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "*  for details ) .",
    "in order to select only red giant branch stars from this sample we follow the approach by @xcite .",
    "we selected all 3,993 stars with @xmath23  @xmath27@xmath25hz  and @xmath28m@xmath4 , which based on stellar models is expected to select only red giant branch stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , this selection do not take measurement uncertainties in @xmath23  and @xmath29 into account , possibly introducing some helium - core burning stars into our sample towards the lower end of the @xmath23  bracket .",
    "we therefore performed a few additional steps to further reduce the possible ` contamination ' by helium - burning stars in our sample .",
    "first , we derived the offset from zero of the harmonic series of radial modes , known as @xmath30 in the asymptotic relation , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the mode frequency and @xmath33 is the radial order .",
    "this offset is known to be different for helium - burning stars @xcite relative to red giant branch stars of similar density , and hence has diagnostic power to distinguish the two types of stars . to measure @xmath30 we calculated frequency power spectra for each star using long - cadence ( @xmath34minutes ) _ kepler _  data obtained between 2009 may 2 and 2012 oct 3 , corresponding to observing quarters 014 , or a total of about 54,000 data points per star .",
    "we used the method by @xcite to fit and remove the background noise profile of the spectra , and then selected the central @xmath35@xmath13spectral range around @xmath23 , which we folded with an interval of @xmath13 .",

    "the lorentzian profiles were centered relative to each other with the one representing quadrupole modes being 0.12@xmath13  to the left of the radial mode profile , and the one representing the dipole modes being 0.52@xmath13  to the right of the radial mode following the results by @xcite ( see figure  [ foldedspectrum ] ) .",

    "although our remaining sample could potentially still include some helium - burning stars if they were not in the @xcite and @xcite samples , the above cross match indicates such contaminants would most likely have @xmath23  @xmath44@xmath25hz . as a final check , we visually inspected the power spectra of the remaining sample ( 3,635 stars ) , which led to the removal of 24 stars that appeared to be helium - core burning or had spectra of such poor quality ( low signal - to - noise or bad window function ) that the stellar classification was ambiguous .",
    "to measure the mode visibilities , we first needed to identify the regions in the power spectra dominated by the different modes . here , we used the @xmath30 values found in the previous step ( sect .",
    "[ sampleselection ] ) to locate the four central radial modes closest to @xmath23 , and followed the approach by @xcite for masking the parts of the spectra dominated by @xmath36 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 modes .",

    "[ examplespectra],width=321 ]    finally , the mode visibilities , @xmath49 , of the non - radial modes were derived as the ratio of the total mode power of the segments associated with a given degree relative to the total radial mode power . for this",
    "we used the background corrected spectra described in sect .",
    "[ sampleselection ] .",
    "we note that the uncertainty in the background estimation introduces measurement scatter on top of the intrinsic spread in the visibilities , potentially pushing intrinsically low values of @xmath49 below zero .",
    "rejecting those stars or artificially pushing them up to @xmath50 would be statistically incorrect and bias our measurements of the average @xmath49 .",
    "in figure  [ vis_vs_numax ] we show our measurements of the dipole mode visibility as function of @xmath23 .",
    "we denote the stars below the dotted line as the dipole - suppressed sample , as opposed to the ` normal ' stars .",
    "as shown in @xcite and @xcite , the predicted visibilities of the suppressed dipole modes ( solid lines ) match the observations remarkably well , and with normal stars on average being less massive . here",
    ", we show that the prediction for the dipole - mode suppression is insensitive to stellar mass for the typical mass range of the _ kepler _  red giants ( the solid black curves fall almost on top of each other ) , which is also what we observe in the data . the slight dependence on mode lifetime , @xmath14 ,",
    "is illustrated by comparing the black curves ( all @xmath51days ) with the gray curves based on a @xmath10m@xmath4  track just above ( @xmath52days ) and below ( @xmath53days ) the black curves .",

    "the quadrupole and octupole visibilities are shown in figures  [ vis2_vs_numax ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . here",
    ", we only show the dipole - suppressed sample as filled symbols , to make it easier to distinguish them from the normal population shown as empty symbols . while less dramatic than the dipole modes , the quadrupole modes show significant reduction in mode power for the dipole - suppressed sample .",
    "the least evolved stars ( @xmath61@xmath23/@xmath25hz  @xmath62 ) show on average @xmath63 , compared to @xmath64 for all the normal stars , corresponding to 49% reduction in power .",
    "although there is overall good agreement between the predictions and the observations , the trend of the visibility as a function of @xmath23  is predicted to be steeper than observed if we , as done here , assume a fixed mode lifetime along the red giant branch ( figure  [ vis2_vs_numax](a ) ) .",
    "we used a lifetime of @xmath65days , which is representative for the average value found by @xcite .",
    "this assumption could , at least partly , explain the discrepancy , because the observed mode lifetimes are most likely increasing as red giants evolve towards lower @xmath23  and lower @xmath66 .",
    "the variation in mode lifetime was found to be roughly 50% by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 7 ) across a sample spanning a @xmath23  range of @xmath67@xmath25hz  ( their table a.2 ) .",
    "our sample span a much larger @xmath23range , and for reference we therefore also show the @xmath10m@xmath4  tracks in gray with factors of two difference in mode lifetime ; 10 and 40 days , respectively . based on this , we conclude that an increasing mode lifetime along the red giant branch could possibly explain the apparent discrepancy of the predicted versus observed trend seen in figure  [ vis2_vs_numax](a ) .",
    "a mode lifetime of @xmath68days at @xmath23  @xmath69@xmath25hz  and a lifetime of @xmath70days at @xmath23  @xmath71@xmath25hz  would provide a better match to the data .",
    "however , we note that the predicted visibilities of the suppressed sample depends somewhat on the overshoot beyond classical schwarzschild implemented in the stellar models ( cantiello et al .",
    "2016 , in prep . ) , so we defer a more thorough analysis to future work , but point out here the possibility of constraining either the mode lifetime or the overshoot given independent measurements of the other .    .",

[ vis2_vs_numax],title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    turning to the octupole modes ( figure  [ vis2_vs_numax](b ) ) , we see no significant effect of the suppression , as anticipated by theory ( solid black curves ) because they are almost purely acoustic envelope modes .",
    "we find the average visibilities to be @xmath74 for the normal stars , and",
    "@xmath75 for the dipole - suppressed sample , which are the same within @xmath76 . in figure  [ vis2_vs_numax](b )",
    "we do not show the tracks of different mode lifetimes because they are essentially indistinguishable from the black curves .",
    "both the evolution of the predicted mode visibility as a function of @xmath23  ( for fixed spherical degree ) and its dependence on mode degree ( for fixed @xmath23 ) are essentially determined by the difference in coupling between the core and envelope as the star evolves ( or as seen by modes of different degree ) .",
    "the key aspect of this predicted behavior is that there is perfect trapping of the mode energy leaking into the core by the suppression mechanism .",
    "hence , given the agreement reported here between theory and observations for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes , in addition to what is seen for dipole modes , supports this notion that the mode suppression mechanism indeed traps almost , if not , all the energy that leaks into the core region .",
    "the theoretical predictions presented in figures  [ vis_vs_numax ] and  [ vis2_vs_numax ] are derived relative to non - suppressed stars , and are hence scaled to the observed average visibilities of the normal stars .",
    "we note that the absolute scale of the observed visibilities reported here are not directly comparable with expectations for the normal stars @xcite because we simply integrated the power over fixed regions of the spectrum in terms of @xmath13 . due to the presence of mixed modes , which strictly speaking",
    "exist across the entire spectrum , small amounts of power ( from gravity - dominated modes far from the acoustic resonant frequencies ) from one degree of modes will be present in the regions that we associate with modes of another degree .",
    "direct comparisons would therefore need to be based on simultaneous fitting of model profiles to all the modes in the spectrum , which is currently not practically possible for large numbers of stars @xcite .",
    "similarly , any differences between the average visibilities reported here and those by @xcite , are most likely due to slight different choices for the mode integration regions in the two studies .",
    "we have measured oscillation mode power in over 3,600 red giant stars , and compared our results to theoretical predictions based on the `` magnetic greenhouse '' mechanism proposed by @xcite for dipole mode suppression .",
    "our results from modes of spherical degrees @xmath77 , provide strong support for one of the main assertions of the theory behind the mode suppression  all mode energy leaking into the g - mode cavity of a star is efficiently trapped or dissipated . specifically , we confirm the up to almost 100% suppression for dipole modes previously shown and measure for the first time up to 49% suppression on average of the quadrupole modes and no suppression of the octupole modes .",
    "we find it likely that a variation in the mode lifetime along the red giant branch could explain the small difference in slope between our prediction and the observations in the @xmath72 versus @xmath23diagram .",
    "however , the variation required needs to be confirmed by measurements of the mode lifetime of radial modes for a robust sample of stars with @xmath23  around 220@xmath25hz  and 70@xmath25hz .",
    "further tests of the magnetic greenhouse effect could be implemented with determinations of the lifetimes of the suppressed dipole modes , or the measurement of suppressed dipole mode visibilities in helium - burning clump stars ( cantiello et al .",

    "<S> the asteroseismology of red giant stars has continued to yield surprises since the onset of high - precision photometry from space - based observations . </S>",
    "<S> an exciting new theoretical result shows that the previously observed suppression of dipole oscillation modes in red giants can be used to detect strong magnetic fields in the stellar cores . </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental facet of the theory is that nearly all the mode energy leaking into the core is trapped by the magnetic greenhouse effect . </S>",
    "<S> this results in clear predictions for how the mode visibility changes as a star evolves up the red giant branch , and how that depends on stellar mass , spherical degree , and mode lifetime . here </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the validity of these predictions with a focus on the visibility of different spherical degrees . </S>",
    "<S> we find that mode suppression weakens for higher degree modes with an average reduction in the quadrupole mode visibility of up to 49% for the least evolved stars in our sample , and no detectable suppression of octupole modes , in agreement with the theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore find evidence for the influence of increasing mode lifetimes on the measured visibilities along the red giant branch , in agreement with previous independent observations . </S>",
    "<S> these results support the theory that strong internal magnetic fields are responsible for the observed suppression of non - radial modes in red giants . </S>",
    "<S> we also find preliminary evidence that stars with suppressed dipole modes on average have slightly lower metallicity than normal stars .    </S>",
