    "formation and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of molecules @xcite have recently been achieved based on ultracold atoms with magnetically - tuned feshbach resonances @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "feshbach coupling is induced by tuning a foreign molecular state near the scattering continuum , which allows for an efficient transfer of colliding atoms into molecules .",
    "this method works for virtually all alkali atoms , and can create ultracold molecules from various sources including bose condensates @xcite , degenerate fermi gases @xcite , or normal thermal gases @xcite .",
    "feshbach molecules have special and unique properties .",
    "they typically populate only one weakly - bound quantum state , and the bound state can strongly couple to the scattering continuum via feshbach resonance .",
    "we may ask the following question : should feshbach molecules rather be considered as molecules in a specific rovibrational state or as pairs of scattering atoms near the continuum ?",
    "this distinction is particularly crucial in the studies of the bec to bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer state ) crossover in degenerate fermi gases , which call for a clarification of the quantum nature of the feshbach molecules @xcite .",
    "molecular states near feshbach resonances have been recently investigated based on sophisticated and complete two - body or many - body theory @xcite and multi - channel scattering calculations @xcite .",
    "all works suggest that the feshbach molecule is generally a coherent mixture of the foreign molecule in the closed channel and long - range atom pair in the open scattering channel . near resonances with large resonance widths ,",
    "the molecules can be well approximated as pairs in the open channel . for narrow resonances , as suggested by numerical calculation @xcite , the closed channel dominates and a short - range molecule picture is appropriate .    in this paper",
    ", we use a simple two - channel model to describe two interacting atoms near a feshbach resonance ( sec .",

    "we introduce a spherical box potential , which allows us to analytically calculate the molecular bound state in different regimes and their threshold behavior ( sec .",
    "iii and sec .",
    "iv ) . finally , we apply our model to feshbach molecules in recent fermi gas experiments and to characterize the associated feshbach resonances ( sec .",
    "we model the interaction of two identical , ultracold atoms with mass @xmath0 based on an open channel @xmath1 that supports the scattering continuum and a closed channel @xmath2 that supports the foreign bound state .",
    "the wave function of the atoms is generally expressed as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the amplitudes in the open and closed channels , respectively , and @xmath6 is the inter - atomic separation .",
    "we assume the interaction @xmath7 is described by a spherical box potential with an interaction range of @xmath8 , see fig .",

    "the potential energy of the open channel is 0 and the closed channel @xmath10 . for @xmath11 , the open ( closed ) channel",
    "has an attractive potential of @xmath12 @xmath13 , and a coupling term @xmath14 between the channels .",
    "the wave function satisfies the schrdinger equation :    @xmath15    .",
    "a bound state with energy @xmath16 relative to the scattering continuum is supported by the closed channel.,width=211 ]    the solution of the above equation for zero scattering energy @xmath17 can be expressed as :    @xmath18    where the scattering length @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constants , @xmath21 are the ",
    "eigen wave numbers \" for @xmath11 associated with the eigen states    @xmath22 .",
    "based on the boundary conditions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we get    @xmath25    the latter equation shows how in general , each channel contributes to the scattering length .    in cold atom systems ,",
    "feshbach resonances are , in most cases , induced by hyperfine interactions or spin - spin interactions .",
    "both interactions are many orders of magnitude weaker than the relevant short range exchange potential .",
    "it is an excellent approximation to assume @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in this limit ,",
    "the closed channel contribution is significant only when the foreign state is close to the continuum , in which case the last term in eq .",
    "( 7 ) diverges .",
    "given the energy of the closed channel state as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the boundary condition @xmath33 allows us to expand the last term in eq .",
    "( 7 ) as @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 characterizes the feshbach coupling strength . to the same order of expansion , the middle term in eq .",
    "( 7 ) is a constant across the resonance and can be identified as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the background scattering length .",
    "equation ( 7 ) reduces to    @xmath38",
    "experimentally , the relative energy between the continuum and the bare state can be adjusted linearly by a magnetic field @xmath39-induced zeeman shift @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the magnetic moment of the open(closed ) channel .",
    "replacing @xmath16 by @xmath43 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( 8) in terms of the magnetic field as    @xmath44    where the resonance width @xmath45 and the resonance position @xmath46 are given by    @xmath47    several interesting features are shown here .",
    "first of all , we find the resonance width is proportional to both the feshbach coupling @xmath48 and the background scattering properties @xmath49 .",
    "the latter dependence is due to the fact that the scattering amplitude at short range is proportional to the scattering length .",
    "a larger short range scattering amplitude leads to a stronger coupling to the closed channel .",
    "secondly and importantly , the resonance position is offset by exactly @xmath45 relative to the crossing of the bare state and the continuum , @xmath50 , see eq .  ( 11 ) . for a positive scattering length @xmath51 ,",
    "this shift is negative @xmath52 .",
    "this feature leads to the  renormalization \" of the feshbach resonance location discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to understand the origin of the resonance shift",
    ", we should return to eq .",
    "the divergence of the scattering length occurs when the open channel contribution ( middle term ) is exactly canceled by the closed channel one ( last term ) . for systems with large background scattering lengths @xmath53 and strong feshbach couplings @xmath48 , this cancelation can occur even when the bare state is far away from the continuum .",
    "a large resonance shift then results .",
    "now we turn to the binding energy of the molecules . assuming a bound eigen state @xmath54 exists near the continuum at @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the binding energy , we can determine @xmath57 by following essentially the same calculation as eq .",

    "the equivalence of eq .",

    "assuming @xmath28 and the bound states in both channels are close to the continuum , namely , @xmath53 and @xmath60 , we can expand the two terms on the right side of eq .",
    "( 12 ) to leading order as @xmath36 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "equation  ( 12 ) then reduces to    @xmath62    this result shows the evolution of the eigen state near the resonance .",
    "similar result is obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite based on a contact potential .",
    "we can immediately see that in the absence of the feshbach coupling @xmath63 , the solutions of eq .",
    "( 13 ) are @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( for @xmath51 ) , which exactly correspond to the bare bound states in the closed channel and the open channel ( for @xmath51 ) , respectively .    in the presence of the feshbach coupling @xmath66 , eq .",
    "( 13 ) suggests an  avoided level crossing \"- like energy structure , see fig .",
    "( 2 ) , which also illustrates the resonance position shifts .",

    "we show in eq .",
    "( 15 ) that the eigen state generally occupies both the closed channel and open channel .",
    "we can introduce a mixing amplitude @xmath75 as the amplitude in the closed channel    @xmath76    the mixing fraction @xmath77 can be evaluated by a direct integration of the closed channel wave function . alternatively , noticing that the mixing also leads to a dependence of the eigen state on the bare state , we can also derive @xmath77 from the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath16 , or from the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule @xmath78 .",
    "all methods lead to the same result    @xmath79",

    "@xmath80    where @xmath81 .    equation ( 20 ) shows identical dependence on scattering length and interaction range as of single channel molecules in the threshold regime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , taking the limit @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 19 ) , we find the molecular wave function here is purely in the open channel .",
    "its spatial extent is determined by quantum uncertainty , @xmath83 , and can be much larger than the interaction range @xmath84 . in this limit ,",
    "the feshbach molecules are identical to long - range atom pairs in a single open channel .    by expanding eq .",
    "( 19 ) at small @xmath85 and using eq .",
    "( 13 ) , we find the closed channel fraction can be expressed as @xmath86    where @xmath87 .    from eq .",
    "( 22 ) , we see that @xmath88 provides the leading order estimation of the closed channel admixture . when @xmath89 or @xmath90 ( this condition applies when @xmath91 ) , the feshbach molecule is purely in the open channel .",
    "as expected , the threshold regime is wider for resonances with larger @xmath48 and @xmath92 .",
    "we can further determine the ",
    "open channel - dominated \" regime by setting @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( 19 ) . for resonances with small @xmath94",
    ", this condition corresponds to @xmath95 , which , in terms of magnetic field , maps to only a small fraction of @xmath96 near the resonance @xmath46 . for resonances with large @xmath97 , the open channel dominates when @xmath98 , which covers the full resonance width when @xmath99 , and covers the entire upper branch of the bound state when @xmath100 .",
    "based on the range of the single channel regime , we suggest the broad(narrow ) resonances be defined as those with @xmath97 ( @xmath101 ) . within the width of the feshbach resonance , the molecules associated with a broad ( narrow ) resonance are better described as long range pairs in the open channel ( short range molecules in the closed channel ) .",

    "these molecules are stable near the resonance and both the molecular binding energies and the scattering lengths have been well measured and studied @xcite .    to model the interaction of atoms , we adopt @xmath46 , @xmath45 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 from recent measurements and numerical calculations . to account for the finite range of the atomic interaction , which at low temperatures is determined by the van der waals potential of @xmath110 , we choose the interaction range @xmath8 in our model to be the mean scattering length @xmath111 defined in ref .",

    "both the li resonance at 834 g and the k resonance are broad with @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "the open channel - dominated regimes of @xmath114  210  mhz for the 834  g li resonance is also larger than the fermi energy of @xmath115  20  khz in the experiments.(here the fermi wave number is @xmath116 . ) for the k resonance , the full upper branch of the molecular state is open channel dominated with mixing fractions less than @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , we conclude the open channel description of these feshbach molecules in the crossover regime to be a good approximation .    for the narrower li resonance at @xmath118543  g , we obtain @xmath119 and @xmath120  31  hz @xmath121  20  khz .",
    "this indicates an extremely narrow open channel regime of less than 50  @xmath109 g near the resonance , where the gas parameter is still over @xmath122 .",
    "crossover experiments based on these feshbach molecules can not be described by open channel atom pairs and may lead to qualitatively different physics .",
    "we attribute the large difference between the two li resonances to their different couplings @xmath48 and very different background scattering length @xmath37 , see table i.    in the above discussions , we note that fermi energy @xmath123 is an external parameter which depends on the density of the sample . whether the molecules in the crossover regime can be described by single channel strongly depends on the density .",
    "the @xmath124 parameter , however , provides a better and independent measure to classify feshbach resonances .",
    "we find that the two feshbach resonances in @xmath102li are the two extremes of broad and narrow resonances with @xmath112 and @xmath125 .    in summary , the two - channel model provides a simple picture to understand the molecular state near the feshbach resonances .",
