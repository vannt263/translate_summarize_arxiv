    "granular gases are usually modelled as a gas of hard spheres dissipating part of their kinetic energy during collisions . in the simplest model , the grains are taken to be smooth so that the inelasticity of collisions is characterized only through a constant coefficient of normal restitution @xmath4 . for a low - density gas ,",
    "the boltzmann kinetic equation has been conveniently modified to account for inelastic binary collisions @xcite and the navier ",
    "stokes transport coefficients @xcite for states with small hydrodynamic gradients have been computed by means of the chapman ",
    "enskog method @xcite around the local version of the homogeneous cooling state . as in the case of elastic collisions ,",
    "the transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of exact linear integral equations which are approximately solved by considering the leading terms in a sonine polynomial expansion of the velocity distribution function .",
    "on the other hand , in spite of this approach , the sonine predictions compare in general quite well with computer simulations , even for quite strong dissipation conditions @xcite .",
    "needless to say , the mathematical difficulties of solving the boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) increase considerably when one considers situations for which large gradients occur and more complex constitutive equations than the navier  stokes ones ( which are linear in the spatial gradients ) are required . for this kind of situations",
    "one has to resort to alternative approaches , such as the use of simplified kinetic models , where the true boltzmann collision operator is replaced by a simpler collision model ( e.g. , the bgk model @xcite ) that preserves its most relevant physical features . in the case of elastic collisions ,",
    "this route has been shown to be very fruitful since most of the exact solutions derived from the bgk model agree rather well @xcite with results obtained by numerically solving the boltzmann equation by means of the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , much less is known for inelastic collisions although some exact results obtained in the simple or uniform shear flow ( usf ) problem @xcite and in the nonlinear couette flow state @xcite support the reliability of the inelastic version of the bgk model @xcite for granular gases as well .",
    "the usf state is perhaps the simplest flow problem since the only nonzero hydrodynamic gradient is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the flow velocity and @xmath3 is the constant shear rate . due to its simplicity",
    ", this state has been widely studied in the past for elastic @xcite and inelastic gases @xcite as an ideal testing ground to shed light on the intricacies associated with the response of the system to strong shear rates . very recently",
    "@xcite , the inelastic bgk model has been applied to determine the transport coefficients for a granular gas in spatially - inhomogeneous states close to the usf .",
    "the heat and momentum fluxes were evaluated to first order in the deviations of the hydrodynamic field gradients from their values in the reference usf state .",
    "given that the system is strongly sheared , the corresponding transport coefficients turn out to be _ nonlinear _ functions of both the shear rate and the coefficient of restitution .",
    "this is the main new ingredient of these constitutive equations .",
    "in addition , due to the mathematical difficulties involved in the general problem , results were restricted to a particular kind of perturbations for which the steady state conditions of the usf hold @xcite . this allowed us to perform a linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic equations with respect to the usf state .    as happens for elastic collisions , a possibility to analyze transport around usf retaining the explicit form of the boltzmann collision operator",
    "is to consider inelastic maxwell models ( imm ) , i.e. , models for which the collision rate is independent of the relative velocity of the two colliding particles .",
    "although these imm do not correspond to any microscopic interaction , it has been shown by several authors @xcite that the cost of sacrificing physical realism can be in part compensated by the amount of exact analytical results derived from this interaction model .",
    "this is the main reason why imm have attracted the attention of physicists and mathematicians since the beginning of the century . on the other hand , beyond its academic interest",
    ", it must be remarked that recent experiments @xcite for magnetic grains with dipolar interactions in air in a two - dimensional geometry have been accurately described by imm .",
    "the excellent quantitative agreement found between the magnetic particles experiments @xcite and imm suggests that magnetic particles can be considered as an ideal experimental probe for the predictions of this analytically tractable kinetic theory .",
    "the main advantage of using imm instead of ihs is that a velocity moment of order @xmath7 of the boltzmann collision operator only involves moments of order less than or equal to @xmath7 .",
    "this allows one to evaluate the boltzmann collision moments without the explicit knowledge of the velocity distribution function @xcite .",
    "thanks to this simplification , the velocity moments of imm under usf can be computed as functions of the shear rate . very recently",
    "@xcite , the first nontrivial shear - rate dependent moments of usf for imm have been explicitly computed : the second - degree moments which are directly related to rheological properties and the fourth - degree moments whose knowledge is necessary to get the heat flux around usf .",
    "the knowledge of these moments allows one to reexamine the problem studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the boltzmann equation and without any restriction on the kind of perturbations to usf considered .",
    "in addition , the comparison between the transport coefficients derived here with those obtained from ihs @xcite can be used again as a test to assess the degree of usefulness of imm as a prototype model for granular flows .",
    "previous comparisons between imm and ihs for inhomogeneous situations @xcite have shown in general good agreement ( especially for low order moments ) , confirming the reliability of imm as a good approximation to model granular systems .",
    "since i am interested in studying heat and momentum transport in a strongly sheared granular gas , the physical situation is such that the gas is in a state that deviates from the usf by _ small _ spatial gradients . under these conditions and taking the usf state @xmath1 as the reference one , the boltzmann equation is solved by means of a chapman  enskog - like expansion @xcite around the distribution @xmath1 . since the latter applies for arbitrary values of the shear rate @xmath3 , the successive approximations in the chapman ",
    "enskog expansion will retain all the hydrodynamic orders in @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the non - equilibrium problem studied here deals with two kind of spatial gradients : _ small _ gradients due to perturbations of the usf and arbitrary _ large _ gradients due to the background shear flow . in this paper , the calculations will be restricted to first order in the spatial gradients of density , temperature and flow velocity . at this level of approximation ,",
    "the momentum transport is characterized by a viscosity tensor @xmath8 , while the heat flux is expressed in terms of a thermal conductivity tensor @xmath9 and a new tensor @xmath10 ( not present in the elastic case ) .",
    "the set of generalized transport coefficients @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are nonlinear functions of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the determination of this dependence for imm is the primary target of this paper .",

    "the dependence of some of the above coefficients on the shear rate and on the coefficient of restitution is illustrated and compared with known results obtained for ihs @xcite .",

    "inelastic _ boltzmann equation @xcite gives the time evolution of @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding boltzmann equation for inelastic maxwell models ( imm ) can be obtained from the inelastic boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) by replacing the rate for collisions between two particles ( which is proportional to the relative velocity in the case of ihs ) by an average velocity - independent collision rate . with this simplification and in the absence of an external force , the boltzmann equation for imm reads @xmath13,\\ ] ] where the boltzmann collision operator is @xmath14 = \\frac{\\omega}{n\\omega_d } \\int d{\\bf v}_{2}\\int d\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma } } \\left [ \\alpha^{-1}f({\\bf v}_{1}')f({\\bf v}_{2}')-f({\\bf v}_{1})f({\\bf v}_{2})\\right ] \\;.\\ ] ] here , @xmath15 is the number density , @xmath16 is the total solid angle in @xmath0 dimensions , @xmath17 is a unit vector along the line of the two colliding spheres , and @xmath18 is the relative velocity of the colliding pair . in addition , the primes on the velocities denote the initial values @xmath19 that lead to @xmath20 following a binary collision : @xmath21 the effective collision frequency @xmath22 is independent of velocity but depends on space and time through its dependence on density and temperature . here",
    ", i will assume that @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "the case @xmath25 will be referred here as model a , while the case @xmath26 will be called model b. model a is closer to the original maxwell model of elastic particles , while model b is closer to hard spheres when @xmath27 . furthermore , the collision frequency @xmath22 can be also seen as a free parameter of the model , determined to optimize the agreement with some property of interest of the original boltzmann equation for ihs . as in previous works @xcite , @xmath22 is chosen here to guarantee that the cooling rate of imm be the same as that of ihs ( evaluated at the local equilibrium approximation)@xcite . with this choice , one gets @xmath28 where the value of the quantity @xmath29 is irrelevant for our purposes . henceforth , i will take this choice for @xmath22 .",
    "there is another more refined version of imm @xcite where the collision rate has the same dependence on the scalar product ( @xmath30 ) as in the case of ihs .",
    "however , both versions of imm lead to similar results in problems as delicate as the high energy tails and so i will consider here the simplest version given by eqs .",

    "the influence of the collision model appears through the @xmath2-dependence of the cooling rate and of the momentum and heat fluxes . in particular ,",

    "this linear velocity profile assumes no boundary layer near the walls and is generated by the lees  edwards boundary conditions @xcite , which are simply periodic boundary conditions in the local lagrangian frame moving with the flow velocity @xcite . since the heat flux is zero in the usf problem , the balance equation for the energy ( [ 2.9 ] ) reads @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 being the hydrostatic pressure .",
    "equation ( [ 2.15.1 ] ) shows that the temperature changes in time due to the competition between two ( opposite ) mechanisms : on the one hand , viscous ( shear ) heating and , on the other hand , energy dissipation in collisions .",
    "the _ reduced _ shear rate @xmath58 is the nonequilibrium relevant parameter of the usf problem since it measures the departure of the system from equilibrium . note that , except for model a ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath59 is a function of time through its dependence on temperature . since in the hydrodynamic regime",
    "@xmath60 depends on time only through its dependence on @xmath61 @xcite , then for @xmath62 a steady state is eventually reached in the long time limit when both viscous heating and collisional cooling cancel each other and the fluid autonomously seeks the temperature at which the above balance occurs .",
    "in this situation , @xmath58 and @xmath2 are not independent quantities but they are related through the steady state condition : @xmath63 however , when @xmath25 , the collision frequency @xmath64 is independent of temperature and @xmath58 remains constant in time , so that there is no steady state ( except if @xmath58 takes the specific value given by ( [ 2.16 ] ) ) .",
    "consequently , only in the case of model a the reduced shear rate @xmath58 and the coefficient of restitution @xmath2 are in general _ independent _ parameters in the usf state . note that , although the temperature changes in time , the distribution of velocities relative to the thermal speed @xmath65 is expected to reach , after a sufficient number of collisions per particle , a stationary form that only depends on the control parameters @xmath58 and @xmath2 @xcite . as a consequence ,",
