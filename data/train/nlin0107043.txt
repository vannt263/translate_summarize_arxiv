    "plays a significant role include flame propagation , neutron flux in a nuclear reactor and the dynamics of defects in nematic liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "work has been done on the propagation of wave - like structures in unbounded systems @xcite , as well as the formation of spatial structures in finite geometries @xcite .",
    "diffusion is typically a limit of a more coherent motion interrupted by scattering events which is valid when the scattering events are extremely frequent",
    ". a useful manner of describing situations in which the frequency of scattering events is not infinitely large is through the incorporation of memories with finite decay times @xcite .",
    "an analytical investigation of reaction - diffusion phenomena based on the introduction of exponential memory in the context of the logistic nonlinearity of the fisher s equation , and a piecewise linearity approximation , was recently given by manne , hurd and kenkre ( mhk ) @xcite .",
    "a number of interesting results appeared in that analysis , including a generalization of the relation between the minimum speed of shock fronts and the system parameters , and the appearance of a speed limit beyond which the fronts would exhibit spatial oscillations .    as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the generalization of fisher s equation is not unique , the one employed in ref .",
    "@xcite having been chosen for analytic tractability .",
    "a more natural generalization results in a more complex structure of the equation , involves a nonlinearity in the damping , and is the subject of the present paper .",
    "our investigations show that , in the light of the present generalization , some of the interesting predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite are modified drastically , while others are only slightly changed .",
    "reference  @xcite first generalized the linear part of eq .",
    "( [ fisher ] ) by incorporating an exponential memory , converted the resulting integro - differential equation via differentiation into a differential ( specifically the telegrapher s ) equation , and finally added the nonlinear logistic term to obtain the starting point of the analysis . here",
    ", however , we take as our point of departure , @xmath6 which reduces to fisher s equation if the nonlinearity is logistic , and if the memory function @xmath7 is a @xmath8-function in time .",

    "this is the speed at which the underlying quasiparticle , whose number density or probability density is described by @xmath0 , moves ballistically ( coherently ) in between scattering events . if the coherent motion is interrupted too often by scattering , the motion looks diffusive and one returns to the fisher limit",
    ".    equation ( [ telegraph ] ) becomes , in the absence of the nonlinearity , @xmath14 , the well - known telegrapher s equation @xcite suggested by lord kelvin for the description of propagation of transatlantic telegraph signals .",

    ", @xmath15 in a significant way .",
    "the former shows that the damping coefficient multiplying @xmath16 is not constant , and can even be negative .    whereas eq .",
    "( [ mhkteleg ] ) is obviously simpler in form than eq .",
    "( [ telegraph ] ) , the latter could be argued to stem from a more natural generalization of the fisher equation , involving a simple replacement of a @xmath8-function memory by a finite decay time memory in the transport term @xmath17 in  ( [ fisher ] ) .",
    "we are interested in comparing the physical consequences of the two generalizations in the context of traveling wave solutions .",
    "we do this in two steps . in section  [ exact ] , we give a general analysis of traveling wave solutions without approximating the equation in any way .",
    "we investigate the minimum speed of wavefronts , the existence of spatially oscillatory fronts given in mhk , and give a qualitative description of all the kinds of front shapes that the system can support as a function of the parameters . in a certain regime in parameter",
