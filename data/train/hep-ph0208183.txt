    "all the introduced kinematic variables have the same definition for both born and radiative kinematics .",
    "but the situation is different for the final hadrons .",
    "the reason is that the energy of the observed hadron is not fixed by measurements of the chosen kinematic variables : @xmath0 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 . as a result",

    "the hadron energy can be defined via conservation laws , but for the radiative process it depends on the unknown energy of the radiated photon . in order to distinguish between the variables , we use the superscript 0 for the quantities calculated for born kinematics : @xmath25 all invariants defined via the measured 4momentum of hadron @xmath8 are also different for born and radiative cases : @xmath26 the last expression follows from 4momentum conservation .",
