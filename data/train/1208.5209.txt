    "over the past two decades , there has been great progress in the generating and utilizing terahertz ( thz ) waves for various applications , including imaging and communications.@xcite among various thz generation methods,@xcite semiconductor surface emitters combined with pulsed laser excitations has been one of the well - established methods,@xcite which are described by either non - linear process@xcite or surge current model@xcite ; photo - carrier accelerations due to the surface field in wide band - gap semiconductors or dipole currents by the efficient separation between electrons and holes in narrow band - gap semiconductors ( so - called , photo - dember effect ) .",
    "indium - based alloys are very attractive as contact - free thz emitters because of the large diffusion velocity difference between electrons and holes .",
    "especially , inas and insb have the much higher electron mobilities ( up to 30,000 @xmath1/v@xmath2s and 76,000 @xmath1/v@xmath2s ) than hole mobilities ( up to 450 @xmath1/v@xmath2s and 850 @xmath1/v@xmath2s).@xcite in the case of infrared pulse excitation ( @xmath3 @xmath4800 nm , the central wavelength of ti : sapphire laser technology ) on inas and insb , the absorption depth ( @xmath4100 nm ) is much shorter than the diffusion scale ( @xmath41 @xmath0 m ) and the large excess energy ( @xmath5 1 ev ) leads to the even higher mobilities of photo - excited carriers.@xcite in this context , inas has been widely used as the most intense contactless thz emitter whereas insb application has been limited probably due to the suppressed emission amplitude via the scattering of electrons into the l valley.@xcite    although thz efficiency of inas is appropriate for contact - free thz applications , directivity of thz waves was hardly controllable . in general , semiconductor - based thz time - domain spectroscopy ( thz - tds ) under pulsed laser excitations",
    "are implemented based on many guiding components such as parabolic mirrors and lenses along reflective directions .",
    "coordinating many optical components along the reflective directions leads to difficulty in controlling the direction of thz waves .",
    "recently , thz studies based on diffusive semiconductors have been destined toward the easier availability and controllability of diffusions ; thz microscopy system was instrumented with excellent spatial resolution using an optical fiber coupled with tilted inas tips@xcite and thz amplitude enhancement was achieved by integrating periodic metal strip lines on in@xmath6ga@xmath7as layers for lateral diffusion currents.@xcite furthermore , increased thz magnitude was reported in magnetic fields up to 8 t at 170 k,@xcite or in microstructured large - area photoconducting emitter with external electric field up to 120 kv / cm at room temperature.@xcite in this paper , we have implemented micro - scale groove patterns acting either as mirrors in ir range ( in the case of v - groove patterns ) or as grids for lateral symmetry breaking ( in the case of parabolic apertures ) , aiming for characterizing the corresponding directivity of thz waves as being measured in reflective , transmissive and lateral detection geometries .",
    "the conventional thz - tds measurements@xcite were performed under the illumination of a ti : sapphire - based laser at 300k whose pulse duration was 150 fs pulse at the center wavelength of 800 nm .",
    "the samples were coordinated with photo - conductive antennas ( pca ) in various detection geometries for characterizing thz waves along different directions as cartooned in fig .",
    "1 . the ir laser source was incident on the sample surface at @xmath8=45@xmath9 in the reflective geometry , otherwise at @xmath8=90@xmath9 focused onto a spot size of 800 @xmath0 m .",
    "the pump beam supplies an excitation fluence of about 0.9 @xmath0j/@xmath10 which corresponds to the linear regime in ( 100)-grown inas.@xcite in the case of reflective and transmissive geometries , thz waves from samples are guided via a pair of off - axis parabolic mirrors into pca whose sensitivity was optimized at around 1 thz .",
    "on the other hand , in the lateral detection geometry , pca was placed very close to the sample ( 1 mm away from the sample edge ) without guiding components .",
    "the samples are classified into two categories ; group * a * ) bare inas epilayers whose thickness was varied from 10 nm to 900 nm , and group * b * ) 1 @xmath0m - thick samples with groove - patterns around 1 @xmath0 m .",
    "the detailed structures and relevant fabrication procedures are described in section * iii - a * for group * a * and in in section * iii - b * for group * b * , respectively .",
    "sb@xmath11 buffer layer and gaas substrate , illustrated with the sketchy band gaps .",
    "( b ) energy band diagrams of inas layers as a function of thickness .",
    "green arrows and red arrows indicate electronic drift or diffusion field directions , respectively .",
    "( c ) thz waveforms from inas layers with different thicknesses , in comparison with gaas substrate ( from back side illumination of laser ) .",
    "vertical arrows on the right - hand side divide thz emission regime , based either on the carrier drift motion ( in thin sample group ) or on the carrier diffusion ( in thick sample group ) with different phase . ]",
    "the transient carrier transport mechanisms contribute to the emission of thz waves when surfaces of semiconductor materials are illuminated by laser pulses ; drift currents by photo - carriers around the surface depletion regions could be biased either towards or against the substrate side , depending on the doping type , whereas the diffusion ( via photo - dember effect ) occurs inherently toward the substrate side .",
    "as discussed earlier , inas is one of the most efficient contactless thz emitters , whose generation mechanism has been associated with photo - dember effect in very thick samples ( @xmath12 100 @xmath0m)@xcite . to examine the thz wave generation mechanisms in inas layer",
    "whose thickness is comparable to or even smaller than the diffusion length scale , we have grown five unintentionally @xmath13-type doped inas epilayers whose thickness was 10 , 20 , 70 , 370 , and 900 nm . to avoid the nonlinear effects , inas was oriented along ( 100 ) direction , grown on gaas substrate ( thickness @xmath4300 @xmath0 m ) as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) . to reduce the lattice mismatch and concomitant strain , alas@xmath14sb@xmath11 layer ( thickness @xmath42.2 @xmath0 m ) was inserted between inas and gaas substrate . at 300 k , bandgap of materials",
    "are roughly illustrated , in parallel with sample structures on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "it is known that the optical rectification effect is minimized along ( 100 ) direction@xcite , thus , the transport mechanisms are discussed from a perspective viewpoint of thz wave generation in this and following subsections .    in the energy band diagram of fig .",
    "2(b ) as a function of sample thickness and @xmath13-type sheet carrier densities ( measured elsewhere)@xcite , we found that the electronic drift due to the tilted potentials at the surface was set to be opposite to the direction of carrier diffusion if available . in the quantum - confined scale of 10 and 20 nm ( thin sample group ) which is smaller than the exciton bohr radius of 36 nm in a bulk inas@xcite ,",
    "the diffusive features are mostly suppressed in contrast to the transient electron - hole separation due to the tilted potential shape around the surface . in 70 nm - thick layer ( thin sample group ) , the direction of transient drift currents are opposite to that of the partly allowed diffusion currents cancelling the net current flow . in thick sample group of 370 nm and 900 nm ,",
    "the carrier diffusion ( mostly dominated by electrons ) can occur throughout the inas layer , whereas the oppositely aligned drifting electrons are spatially localized within the surface depletion layer of about 50 nm .",
    "such thickness - dependent transport features are further confirmed by tracing the amplitudes and phases of thz waves which are associated with the transient gradient of dipole density , ambient electric field strength and dipole polarizations .",
    "2(c ) shows the thz - tds results in reflection geometry as a function of inas layer thickness . as a reference ,",
    "gaas substrate was illuminated from backward direction and the corresponding thz waves were displayed on top of fig .",
    "the thz amplitude showed rapid increment after 70 nm .",
    "this amplitude variation in samples thicker than the absorption depth ( @xmath4 100 nm ) and exciton bohr diameter is understood based on the efficient carrier diffusion and subsequent thz wave radiation .",
    "we further note that the opposite direction of electronic motions between the thin samples ( dominated by the carrier drift ) and thick sample group ( dominated by the diffusion ) led to the opposite phase of thz waves as indicated by the vertical arrows in fig .",
    "intriguingly , 70 nm - thick sample showed even smaller thz amplitude than thinner samples , which testifies to the barely initiated diffusions cancelling out the influence from electron drift along opposite direction . in this regard , in a thickness range larger than the 370 nm , the underlying thz wave generation mechanisms is based on the electronic diffusion which will be further engineered for directional control of thz waves in the following section * iii - b*.       ( 0.5 @xmath0 m and 1.2 @xmath0 m with trapezoidal patterns , and 2.5 @xmath0 m with parabolic patterns ) . ]",
    "inas epitaxial layers ( thickness @xmath41 @xmath0 m ) were grown by molecular beam epitaxy along ( 100 ) direction on a gaas substrate ( thickness @xmath4500 @xmath0 m ) as shown in figure 3(a ) .",
    "inas layers were @xmath15-type doped with a concentration of @xmath41.5@xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "a gasb layer ( thickness @xmath42 @xmath0 m ) was inserted as a buffer layer to reduce the interfacial lattice mismatch . to fabricate the groove patterns , electron resist ( er )",
    "was coated on top of inas layer ( fig .",
    "the electron beam writing was adapted for developing groove patterns on the er using shot - modulation in electron - beam lithography , followed by dry etching process using inductively coupled plasma etcher with combined use of composite gas of cl@xmath18 and n@xmath18 for forming groove patterns .",
    "3(d ) shows the proposed structure with a trapezoidal groove angle of 45@xmath9 with pattern width ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the pattern width @xmath19 was varied from 0.5 @xmath0 m and 1.2 @xmath0 m to 2.5 @xmath0 m as shown in the sem images of fig .",
    "it is notable that @xmath19 was varied in a comparable scale to the electronic diffusion length in inas ( @xmath41.3 @xmath0m).@xcite the blue lines in fig .",
    "3(e ) are guide to eyes for intended structures either with trapezoid - shaped grooves ( in the case of @xmath19=0.5 and 1.2 @xmath0 m ) or with parabolic - aperture grooves ( in the case of @xmath19=2.5 @xmath0 ) . during the fabrications ,",
    "the edges of groove patterns were slightly deformed , identified as the deviation of sem images from the blue lines in fig .",
    "the area of groove - patterned region was estimated to be about @xmath20 mm@xmath21 .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows a comparison between thz emission in reflective and in transmissive geometries in inas bare samples as a reference .",
    "as expected , the signal along the transmissive direction in fig .",
    "4(a ) was mostly suppressed since the diffusive dipoles are mostly aligned along the growth direction with relatively much weaker lateral components and the subsequent thz radiation patterns are perpendicular to transient currents .",
    "in addition , the thz waves generated within the inas layer along the lateral direction are restrictedly coupled with the internal radiation cone along surface - normal direction due to the large mismatch in refractive index at the surface ( the refractive index of @xmath43.5 for inas compared to @xmath41.0 for free space).@xcite the small and slow oscillatory features after 10 ps could be ascribed to fabry - perot interference between air - inas and air - gaas interfaces .        in the case of groove - patterned structures , in clear contrast to the bare layer , we found that the thz signals were significantly enhanced along transmissive direction as shown in fig .",
    "the incident beam was normal to the surface and polarized linearly and orthogonally to the striped patterns . due to the formation of diffusion - induced transient dipoles along the surface via the reflected ir pulses toward the lateral direction ,",
    "the thz radiation patterns are now profiled toward the line - of - sight direction , manifested by the increased amplitude in fig .",
    "particularly , a sample with @xmath19 of 1.2 @xmath0 m turned out to be the most efficient which was in a similar scale to the diffusion length in inas.@xcite the signals from a sample with @xmath19 of 0.5 @xmath0 m was less enhanced in that the electrons can easily diffuse from one side to the other , thus , could be attracted to the rather stationary holes . in the case",
    "when @xmath19= 2.5 @xmath0 m , the patterns could break the lateral symmetry of diffusion but with limited lateral diffusion efficiency , considering the large laser spot size compared to @xmath19 .",
    "some further arguments could be raised regarding the results in fig .",
    "4(b ) ; 1 ) the fabry - perot interference was persistent in patterned structures , implying that the refractive index contrast at the interfaces was still persistent .",
    "thus , the radiation outcoupling efficiency between the inside the materials and the free space seems not influenced by the groove patterns .",
    "2 ) photocarriers generated in slope pyramid plane in the trapezoidal patterns could undergo the diffusion along the ( 110 ) direction with the much reduced carrier mobility and with heavier effective mass compared to those along ( 100 ) direction , which leads to the reduced photo - dember field and the limited amplitude enhancement .",
    "3 ) the not - perfectly defined faces of groove patterns could lead to the scattering loss of the incident ir photons .",
    "the pattern scale was much smaller than the thz wavelength , possibly triggering the rayleigh scattering .",
    "such arguments could be further discussed elsewhere based on spectrum - domain studies and angle - dependent amplitude analysis . along the lateral direction ( fig .",
    "4(c ) ) , in clear contrast to transmissive direction , we could not observe the signal changes between patterned structures and the bare samples .",
    "the signals in general in fig .",
    "4(c ) were much weaker than those in other geometries , possibly due to the slightly misaligned thz guiding optics , the scattering losses at the rough facets , and attenuation inside the medium . as a comparative purpose , we normalized thz signal amplitudes from the patterned structures either in the transmissvie or in lateral geometries by those from the bare inas layer in fig .",
    "thz wave amplitudes were increased significantly depending on the structural parameters of the periodic groove patterns , only along the line - of - sight trasmission direction .",
    "the highest amplitude enhancement ratio at @xmath19=1.2 @xmath0 m indicates that the optimized adjustment of @xmath19 could be further obtained around the diffusion length .",
    "for a purpose of directional control of thz waves , 1 @xmath0m - thick inas epilayers were processed to have either 45 degree reflectors ( with gap width @xmath19 of 0.5 or 1.2 @xmath0 m ) or parabolic apertures with @xmath19 of 2.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "the @xmath19 and the sample thickness were designed to be similar to the diffusion length in which scale the thz emissions are predominantly generated by photo - dember effect .",
    "we have performed thz - tds measurements excited with a pulsed ir source of ti : sapphire laser at 300 k. thz - tds resulted in a dramatic contrast among different emission directions . in patterned structures , specifically with mirror - like trapezoidal patterns ,",
    "thz signals were enhanced along the transmissive direction whereas the lateral thz emission was not varied by the additional patterning .",
    "the enhancement was rather associated with the efficient lateral dipole formation , optimized when @xmath19 was similar to the diffusion length .",
