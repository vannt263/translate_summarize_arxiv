    "a most intriguing challenge is to understand how asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars transform their surrounding mass - loss shells in a couple of thousand years into the variety of shapes and sizes observed in planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "there are a number of theories currently being investigated . in the generalized interacting stellar wind model , a variety of axisymmetric pn shapes",
    "are obtained by the interaction of a very fast central star wind with the progenitor agb circumstellar envelope ( kwok 1982 ) , when the latter is denser near the equator than the poles ( frank et al .",
    "sahai & trauger ( 1998 ) proposed that the primary agent for shaping pne is not the density contrast , but a high speed collimated outflow of a few 100 km / s .",
    "no consensus about the dominant physical process responsible for the shaping of pne has emerged so far , but there is agreement that they occur during the early agb - to - pn transition stage . however , the details of the rates of evolution and the strength of the stellar winds during the agb - to - pn transition phase are very poorly known , either theoretically or observationally . to remedy this",
    "we have started to study a sample of post - agb objects spectroscopically .",
    "objects with far infrared colors typical of pne were selected from the iras catalogue . apart from pne , only post - agb stars are typically found in this part of the color - color diagram .",
    "furthermore , the objects selected were not detected in the radio continuum above a detection limit of 3 mjy ( van de steene & pottasch 1993 ) .",
    "hence they do nt seem to have evolved to the pn stage as yet .",
    "we obtained jhkl images of the candidates with caspir on the 2.3-m telescope at siding spring observatory in australia in order to obtain accurate positions for the iras counterparts .",
    "subsequently , high resolution optical spectra were obtained with the double beam spectrograph on the 2.3-m telescope .",
    "the resolution was 0.55    per pixel .",
    "we present h@xmath0 profiles of selected post - agb stars showing h@xmath0 in emission .",
    "obviously not all objects showed h@xmath0 in emission , some have h@xmath0 in absorption and some show neither h@xmath0 emission or absorption .",
    "some of the post - agb stars detected in the near infrared could not be seen in the optical due to large extinction .",
    "the wings are not fitted well when only gaussian profiles are used .",
    "we fitted the h@xmath0 emission lines with the sum of a ` generalized ' lorentz emission profile and a gaussian absorption profile .",
    "a ` generalized ' lorentz profile is defined as @xmath1 $ ] with @xmath2 ( the hwhm of the profile ) and @xmath0 as free parameters . for @xmath3",
    "this is the familiar lorentz profile . since all observed profiles are wider on the blue side , the hwhm of the fitted profile was allowed to have different values in the red and the blue part ( across the absorption ) .",
    "the results of the fits are shown in table  [ results ] .",
    "the listed absolute flux is for the whole , integrated profile and has not been dereddened .",
    "the listed fwhm is the sum of the blue and red hwhm .",
    "the entries @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the velocities of the center of the absorption and the emission peak relative to the systemic velocity .",
    "we determined the systemic velocity from photospheric absorption lines using cii at 6578.05    and 6582.88   and hei at 6678.15   , if detected .",
    "we used the equivalent widths of these lines to determine the spectral types of the objects by comparing them with the results of lennon et al .",
    "we calculated the terminal velocity of the wind @xmath6 from the blue edge of the absorption in the h@xmath0 profile according to : @xmath6 = fwhm@xmath7 .",
    ".fit parameters for the h@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "the similarity in the h@xmath0 profiles leads us to suggest the following interpretation of our observations .",
    "trammel et al .  ( 1994 ) determined that the h@xmath0 emission of iras 08005@xmath82356 was polarized .",
    "based on the polarization angles , they suggested a bipolar geometry for this object . a bipolar geometry was also suggested for iras 16594@xmath84656 based on hst images by hrivnak et al .",
    "based on the similarity of the presented emission line profiles , quite a few of our objects could be bipolar pne .",
    "the lack of other forbidden emission lines in the spectra indicates that the h@xmath0 emission is not due to photo - ionization of the shell .",
    "iras 16594@xmath84656 is the only star in our sample for which [ oi ] emission was observed .",
    "no [ nii ] or [ sii ] emission was detected in any of the spectra .",
    "consequently the main h@xmath0 emission can not be caused by shock emission either .",
    "the blue peak in the h@xmath0 emission is too faint compared to the red peak to originate from a disk or expanding shell .",
    "the p - cygni type of the h@xmath0 profiles indicates the presence of a strong stellar wind which can produce the emission line and the blue - shifted absorption .",
    "the terminal velocity of the wind can be derived from the position of the blue absorption edge .",
    "the velocity of the fast wind is around 100  km / s .",
    "no value for @xmath9 could be determined for iras 06053@xmath101837 and iras 15144@xmath85812 , but indications are that they have a higher velocity than the rest of the sample .",
    "the absorption is too deep to be photospheric , hence the absorption must be produced outside the emission region . for post - agb stars",
    "the fast stellar wind is encircled by the slower agb wind , which can absorb line photons produced by the fast wind .",
    "the velocity of the center of the absorption is similar to the agb wind velocity or higher .",
    "this suggests that the absorption occurs in the fast wind itself or in the region where the fast wind sweeps up the slow wind .",
    "the h@xmath0 profiles show very extended wings , which we can follow in our spectra up to @xmath11500 km / s and even 1500  km / s for iras 08005@xmath82356 . in the case of hd101584 , a type b9ii post - agb star with a spectrum very similar to our sample , bakker et al .",
    "( 1996 ) attributed the wings to electron scattering by free electrons in the stellar wind",
    ". however , thomson scattering is wavelength independent and the fact that we do nt see wings in our br@xmath12 spectra argues against this .",
    "multiple rayleigh scattering off neutral hydrogen in the expanding agb shell or multiple scattering off dust grains in that same shell may be able to produce these wings as well . however , rayleigh scattering has too low a cross section to be of much importance in a dusty environment like a post - agb star .",
    "grain scattering is supported by trammel et al .",
    "( 1994 ) who suggested that the polarization of h@xmath0 was most likely caused by scattering off dust grains in a dense torus surrounding the central star in iras 08005@xmath82356 .",
    "however , for both cases , the fact that the observed velocities in the wings are so much larger than the agb or post - agb wind velocities casts doubt on this explanation . to reach the observed velocities",
    "the scattering must occur in the wind or maybe in a keplerian disk , if there is one .",
    "it is still unclear what causes them .",
    "extended wings have also been observed in young compact pne such as m2@xmath89 ( balick 1989 ) , mz@xmath83 ( lpez & meaburn 1983 ) , cn  3@xmath81 and m3@xmath827 ( miranda et al .  1997 ) .",
    "no profound explanation for these wings has been proposed in the literature .",
