    "the construction of high - energy neutrino telescopes is aimed at extending the distances accessible to neutrino astronomy to cosmological scales .",
    "this new window onto the cosmos will provide a probe of the most powerful sources in the universe through observations of high - energy neutrinos .",
    "the existence of extra - galactic high energy neutrino sources is implied by the observations of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) , @xmath4  ev , cosmic - rays .",
    "the cosmic - ray spectrum flattens at @xmath5  ev @xcite .",
    "there are indications that the spectral change is correlated with a change in composition , from heavy to light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these characteristics , which are supported by analysis of fly s eye , agasa and hires - mia data , and for which some evidence existed in previous experiments  @xcite , suggest that the cosmic ray flux is dominated at energies @xmath6  ev by a galactic component of heavy nuclei , and at uhe by an extra - galactic source of protons .",
    "also , both the agasa and fly s eye experiments report an enhancement of the cosmic - ray flux near the galactic disk at energies @xmath7  ev , but not at higher energies  @xcite .    irrespective of the nature of the cosmic - ray sources ,",

    "even larger detectors may be required at higher energies .",
    "the construction of detectors with effective volume @xmath10 at energies @xmath11  tev may require the use of techniques different than the under - water / ice optical cerenkov technique employed by the amanda , antares , baikal , icecube , nemo , and nestor experiments .",
    "such alternative technique may be , e.g. , the detection of coherent radio emission from @xmath12  ev neutrino induced cascades @xcite .",
    "the origin of uhe cosmic - rays is one of the most exciting open questions of high energy astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the extreme energy of the highest energy events poses a challenge to models of particle acceleration .",
    "very few known astrophysical objects have characteristics indicating that they may allow acceleration of particles to the observed high energies .",
    "the detection of high energy neutrinos may resolve the puzzle of uhe cosmic - ray origin , as the high energy neutrinos , unlike the charged cosmic - ray protons which are subject to deflection by magnetic fields , will point directly to their sources .",
    "the most powerful known extra - galactic objects , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , are candidate sources for the production of uhe cosmic - rays , and are therefore likely sources of neutrinos in the energy range of 1 to @xmath9  tev .",
    "grbs are transient flashes of @xmath1  mev gamma - rays lasting typically for 1 to 100  s , that are observed from sources at cosmological distances .",

    "is believed to drive a relativistic plasma outflow that results in the acceleration of high - energy particles , which emit non - thermal radiation .",
    "a similar process could also power galactic micro - quasars , which may be considered as a scaled - down version of agn , powered by stellar - mass black holes or neutron stars .    despite the overall success of models in explaining the observed phenomena associated with these high energy sources , the models are largely phenomenological and our understanding of underlying physical processes is still incomplete . in all cases",

    "the discussion illustrates how neutrino observations will help resolving open questions related to the physics that underlies models of high energy astrophysical sources . in   [ sec : mqs ] we briefly review neutrino emission from micro - quasars .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that a detection of even a handful of neutrino events correlated with grbs will allow to test for neutrino properties , e.g. flavor oscillation and coupling to gravity , and to place constraints on deviation from lorentz invariance with accuracy many orders of magnitude better than currently possible .",

    "the origin of this discrepancy is not yet clear .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that since the @xmath45 flux is dominated by sources at distances @xmath46 , over which the distribution of known astrophysical systems ( e.g. galaxies , clusters of galaxies ) is inhomogeneous , significant deviations from model predictions presented in fig .

    "[ eq : grb_p_rate ] sets an upper limit to the neutrino flux that may be produced by sources which , like grbs and the observed jets of agn , are optically thin to pion producing interactions of protons with source photons ( or ambient nucleons ) @xcite .",

    "the @xmath57 factor arises because neutral pions , which do not produce neutrinos , are produced with roughly equal probability with charged pions , and because in the decay of charged pions muon neutrinos carry approximately half the charged pion energy .",

    "there are two speculative types of sources for which the waxman - bahcall bound , eq .",
    "[ eq : nu - bound ] , does not apply .",
    "these sources , for which we have no observational evidence to date , could in principle produce a neutrino flux exceeding the waxman - bahcall limit .",
    "the first special type of source is one in which neutrinos are produced by processes other than photo - meson or proton - nucleon interactions .",
    "such sources include , e.g. , decays of topological defects or of supermassive dark matter particles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the second type of special source is one for which the optical depth for photo - production of mesons ( or for proton - nucleon interaction ) is high .",
    "examples of such optically thick scenarios include neutrinos produced in the cores of agns ( rather than in the jets ) , or in a collapsing galactic nucleus @xcite .",
    "one may obtain an estimate for the required telescope size by considering the minimal flux of a source that may be detected by a neutrino telescope of effective area @xmath66 ( in the plane perpendicular to the source direction ) and exposure time @xmath67 .",
    "the probability that a muon , produced by interaction of a muon neutrino with a nucleon , will cross the detector is given by the ratio of the muon and neutrino mean free paths , which ( for water , ice ) is approximately given by @xmath68 , with @xmath69 for @xmath70  tev and @xmath71 for @xmath72  tev .",
    "a source of energy flux @xmath73 in neutrinos of energy @xmath74 will produce @xmath75 events in the detector .",

    "the only known class of steady sources that produce such high luminosity are agn .",
    "it is therefore clear that km - scale neutrino detectors are required for the detection of cosmological sources .",
    "this argument holds also for transient sources : the brightest known transients are grbs , which produce luminosity @xmath80 over @xmath81  s duration . replacing @xmath82  yr with @xmath83  s in the above equation , implies a minimum luminosity @xmath84 .",
    "a lower limit to the source flux is also set by the requirement that the signal would exceed the background produced by atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino flux is approximately given by @xmath85 , with @xmath86 for @xmath87  tev and @xmath88 for @xmath89  tev .",
    "given that the expected angular resolution of the telescopes is approximately @xmath90  degree , the source flux for which the signal constitutes a @xmath91 detection over the atmospheric background flux is @xmath92 thus , for km - scale detectors the atmospheric neutrino background does not pose more stringent constraints on source flux than those imposed by the requirement for a detectable signal ( except at low energies ) .",
    "using arguments similar to those used in   [ sec : point ] , we may obtain the minimum intensity of a diffuse neutrino background , that will allow its detection by a detector of effective area @xmath66 observing @xmath93  sr of the sky over a duration @xmath67 .",
    "the intensity required for the detection of @xmath48 events is @xmath94 and the minimum intensity required for a @xmath91 detection over the atmospheric background is @xmath95    we compare in figure  [ fig : bound ] the projected sensitivity of km - scale detectors , based on eqs .",

    "[ sec : summary ] , at energy @xmath96  tev the required effective volume is @xmath97 .",
    "general phenomenological considerations , based on @xmath99-ray observations , indicate that , regardless of the nature of the underlying sources , grbs are produced by the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistic expanding fireball @xcite .",
    "a compact source , @xmath100  cm , produces a wind , characterized by an average luminosity @xmath101 and mass loss rate @xmath102 . at small radius ,",
    "the wind bulk lorentz factor , @xmath103 , grows linearly with radius , until most of the wind energy is converted to kinetic energy and @xmath103 saturates at @xmath104 .",
    "variability of the source on a time scale @xmath105  ms , resulting in fluctuations in the wind bulk lorentz factor @xmath103 on a similar time scale , results in internal shocks in the ejecta at a radius @xmath106 .",
    "it is assumed that internal shocks reconvert a substantial part of the kinetic energy to internal energy , which is then radiated as @xmath99-rays by synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation of shock - accelerated electrons . at a later stage ,",
    "the shock wave driven into the surrounding medium by the expanding fireball ejecta leads to the emission of lower - energy `` afterglow . ''",
    "since the observed radiation is produced at a large distance , @xmath107 , from the underlying source , the model is largely independent of the nature of the underlying compact object , as long as this object is capable of producing a wind with the properties implied by observations .",
    "the underlying grb progenitors are yet unknown .",
    "collapse of massive stars and mergers of compact objects ( e.g. of binary neutron stars ) are the most widely discussed candidates @xcite .",
    "the observed radiation is produced , both during the grb and the afterglow , by synchrotron emission of shock accelerated electrons . in the region where electrons are accelerated , protons are also expected to be shock accelerated .",
    "the internal shocks within the expanding wind are mildly relativistic ( in the wind rest frame ) , and hence we expect our understanding of non - relativistic shock acceleration to apply to the acceleration of protons in these shocks .",
    "in particular , the predicted energy distribution of accelerated protons is expected to be @xmath108 @xcite , similar to the predicted electron energy spectrum , which is consistent with the observed photon spectrum .",
    "several constraints must be satisfied by wind parameters in order to allow proton acceleration to high energy @xmath109 .",
    "we summarize below these constraints .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "the requirement that the acceleration time be smaller than the wind expansion time sets a lower limit to the strength of the wind magnetic field , which may be expressed as a lower limit to the ratio of magnetic field to electron energy density @xcite , @xmath110 where @xmath111  ev , @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the wind @xmath99-ray luminosity .",
    "a second constraint is imposed by the requirement that the proton acceleration time be smaller than the proton energy loss time , which is dominated by synchrotron emission .",
    "this sets an upper limit to the magnetic field strength , which in turn sets a lower limit to @xmath103 @xcite @xmath114 here , @xmath115  s. as explained in @xcite , the constraints eq .",
    "[ eq : xib ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : gmin ] hold regardless of whether the fireball is a sphere or a narrow jet ( as long as the jet opening angle is @xmath116 ) .",
    "the luminosity in eq .",
    "[ eq : xib ] is the `` isotropic equivalent luminosity '' , i.e. the luminosity under the assumption of isotropic emission .",
    "internal shocks within the wind occur over a wide range of radii , corresponding to a wide range of variability time scales : @xmath117  ms , the dynamical time of the source , to @xmath117  s , the wind duration .",
    "protons are therefore accelerated to high energy over a wide range of radii .",
    "in particular , at large radii the external medium affects fireball evolution , and a `` reverse shock '' is driven backward into the fireball ejecta and decelerates it , due to the interaction with the surrounding medium .",
    "this shock is also mildly relativistic , and its parameters are similar to those of an internal shock with @xmath105  s. protons may therefore be accelerated to ultra - high energy in this shock as well @xcite .",
    "the constraints eq .",

    "this suggests that grbs and uhe s may originate from common sources .",

    "these observations would also test the weak equivalence principle , according to which photons and neutrinos should suffer the same time delay as they pass through a gravitational potential . with 1  s accuracy , a burst at a distance of 1  gpc would reveal a fractional difference in limiting speed @xmath159 , and a fractional difference in gravitational time delay of order @xmath160 ( considering the galactic potential alone ) .",
    "previous applications of these ideas to supernova 1987a , where simultaneity could be checked only to an accuracy of order several hours , yielded much weaker upper limits : of order @xmath161 and @xmath162 for fractional differences in the limiting speed and time delay , respectively .",
    "the model discussed above predicts the production of high energy muon and electron neutrinos with a 2:1 ratio ( tau neutrinos may be produced by photo - production of charmed mesons ; however , the higher energy threshold and lower cross - section for charmed - meson production , compared to pion production , typically imply that the ratio of charmed - meson to pion production is @xmath163 @xcite ) . because of",
    "neutrino oscillations , neutrinos that get here are expected to be almost equally distributed between flavors for which the mixing is strong .",
    "upgoing taus , rather than muons , would be a distinctive signature of such oscillations",
    ". it may be possible to distinguish between taus and muons in a km@xmath8-scale detector , since at @xmath9  tev the tau decay length is @xmath1  km .",
    "this will allow a `` tau appearance experiment '' .",
    "the jets associated with galactic micro - quasars @xcite are believed to be ejected by accreting stellar - mass black holes or neutron stars .",
    "much like for agn , the content of the jets is an open issue .",
    "the dominant energy carrier in the jet is at present unknown ( with the exception of the jet in ss433 ) .",
    "scenarios whereby energy extraction is associated with spin - down of a kerr ( rotating ) black hole favor electron - positron composition ( although baryon admixture is an issue ) , while scenarios in which an initial rise of the x - ray flux leads to ejection of the inner part of the accretion disk imply electron - positron jets , as widely claimed to be suggested by the anti - correlation between the x - ray and radio flares seen during major ejection events .",
    "a possible diagnostic of electron - positron jets is the presence of doppler - shifted spectral lines , such as the h@xmath164 lines as seen in ss433 .",
    "the detection of such lines from jets having a lorentz-@xmath103 factor well in excess of unity ( as is the case in the super - luminal micro - quasars ) may , however , be far more difficult than in ss433 , as the lines are anticipated to be very broad .",
    "neutrino telescopes may prove to be a much sharper diagnostic tool .",
    "if the energy content of the jets in the transient sources is dominated by electron - proton plasma , then a several hour outburst of 1 to 100  tev neutrinos ( and high - energy photons ) produced by photo - production of pions should precede the radio flares associated with major ejection events @xcite .",
    "several neutrinos may be detected during a single outburst by a km@xmath8-scale detector @xcite , thereby providing a powerful probe of micro - quasar jet physics and of their innermost structure .",
