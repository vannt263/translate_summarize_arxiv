    "the most simple electron transfer reaction that can take place in pure water is , in the notation of eq.([intro1 ] ) , @xmath56 how does a metallic surface in contact with pure water increase the reaction rate of eq.([pwr1 ] ) required to give pure water the well known @xmath57 value ?",

    "more precisely , the quantitative estimates of the free energy change @xmath52 requires the physical picture of having extra electrons within the ordered water layer .",
    "the first estimate of the electron chemical potential renormalization of electrons within an ordered water domain were made by preparata employing a quantum electrodynamic viewpoint toward ordered domain formation .",
    "the central physical point is as follows .",
    "if a single water molecule is held together by coulomb forces alone , then then the energy eigenstate wave functions can be chosen as real and can be chosen to be eigenstates of the parity operator .",
    "the ground state wave function for a single water molecule thereby must have a zero mean dipole moment @xmath61 . on the other hand ,",
    "the off diagonal matrix elements @xmath62 with @xmath63 need not vanish .",
    "so the physical statement that the water molecule has a dipole moment must refer to off diagonal matrix elements . if the polarization , @xmath64 is non - zero , then the off diagonal matrix elements of the dipole moment @xmath65 of the @xmath66 molecule must appreciably contribute to the average in eq.([owl1 ] ) .",
    "thus , in a ferroelectric ordered domain , the internal electronic structure is only partly in the ground state and partly in an excited state .",
    "this physical picture leads to an explanation of why ionic charged particles form in electrolytic water solutions , _",
    "i.e. _ why it is so easy to remove an electron from a polarized molecule from an excited electronic state .",
    "as in all phase transitions , the reasons for ferroelectric ordering reside in the collective motions of many molecules .",
