    "can give additional information on the possible `` majorana '' nature of the neutrino , i.e. when each neutrino eigenstate @xmath6 coincides with its anti - particle @xmath7 .",
    "in such a case , lepton number would be no longer conserved and physics beyond the standard model would be required .",
    "additionally , neutrinoless double beta decay can give an indirect measurement on the absolute mass of neutrinos and shed light to the hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "this is very important when compared to similar bounds from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structures ( lss ) in the universe . +",
    "two - neutrino double beta decay ( 2@xmath0 ) is a second - order process in the standard model in which a nucleus changes its atomic number @xmath8 by two units , with the emission of two beta particles and two neutrinos , e.g. : @xmath9 such a decay can be observed for some even - even nuclei when ordinary beta decay is energetically prohibited .",
    "this decay is very rare with typical half - lives ranging from @xmath1010@xmath11 to @xmath1010@xmath12 yr .",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay can be viewed as the ordinary two - neutrino double beta decay where no neutrino is emitted in the final state : @xmath13 while the 2@xmath0 process is not forbidden by any conservation law in the standard model , 0@xmath0 can only occur if the neutrino has a non - zero mass and is a majorana particle .",
    "theoretical models predict that 0@xmath0 could be mediated by a light majorana neutrino . indeed , within the su@xmath14(2)@xmath15u(1 ) standard model of electroweak interactions , 0@xmath0",
    "can be seen as the exchange of a virtual neutrino between two neutrons in the nucleus ; the majorana particle emitted by the first neutron contains two helicity components : a dominant negative one and a very small positive one .",
    "the latter is seen as an antineutrino when absorbed by the second neutron .",
    "this is only possible if the neutrino is not in a pure helicity state ( therefore it has mass ) and it is identical to its anti - particle . for these reasons , the observation of neutrinoless double beta decay would definitely demonstrate the majorana nature of the neutrino .",
    "in addition , the effective mass of the majorana neutrino can be measured and the hierarchy of the mass eigenstates can be investigated .",
    "+ the effective majorana neutrino mass is related to the half - life of the decay by the following relation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electron mass , @xmath18 is the phase space factor , @xmath19 is the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) and @xmath20 is the effective majorana electron neutrino mass : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the masses of the neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath23 the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix and @xmath24 and @xmath25 the relative majorana cp phase factors . + the 0@xmath0 decay can be experimentally observed as a narrow peak in the end - point of the 2@xmath0 decay energy spectrum , corresponding to the q - value ( q@xmath26 ) of the decay .",
    "the number of counts in the peak would allow to quantify the decay rate of the process or , in case of no signal , to set a lower limit on it , via the relation : @xmath27 with @xmath28 the avogradro s number , @xmath29 the total exposure ( detector mass @xmath15 live time ) , @xmath30 the detection efficiency , @xmath31 the enrichment fraction of the enriched material ( @xmath31 corresponds to the fraction of @xmath1ge atoms ( @xmath32 ) in gerda ) and @xmath33 its atomic mass ( 75.6 g for @xmath1ge ) .",
    "@xmath34 is the observed signal strength or the corresponding upper limit .",
    "+ the gerda experiment@xcite searches for neutrinoless double beta decay of @xmath1ge , in which @xmath1ge ( z=32 ) would decay into @xmath1se ( z=34 ) and two electrons .",
    "the detectors implemented in the gerda setup are semiconductors made from material with an isotope fraction of @xmath1ge enriched to about 86% ( @xmath35ge ) , which acts as both the @xmath36 decay source and a 4@xmath37 detector .",
    "the detectors are characterized by a very good energy resolution , which allows a clear distinction of the neutrinoless double beta peak at @xmath38=2039 kev , which is an energy region that is nearly background - free .",
    "+ prior to the latest gerda results , the best limits for 0@xmath0 decay in @xmath1ge were provided by the heidelberg - moscow ( hdm)@xcite and igex@xcite enriched @xmath1ge experiments , that yielded lower half - life limits of @xmath39 yr and @xmath40 yr respectively , corresponding to an upper limit on the effective majorana mass of @xmath41 0.33@xmath421.35 ev ; the range in mass arises from the estimated uncertainty in the nuclear matrix elements .",
    "a subgroup of the hdm collaboration claimed the observation of 0@xmath0 with a half - life of @xmath431.19@xmath4410@xmath4 yr , corresponding to a range for @xmath45 between 0.24 and 0.58 ev , with a central value of 0.44 ev@xcite . in a more sophisticated analysis , the authors found a value for the half - life @xmath462.23@xmath4710@xmath4 yr@xcite , though some inconsistencies associated to this result have been pointed out in ref .  .",
    "+ the aim of the phase i of the gerda experiment was to verify the previous results and to reach a much higher sensitivity than previous experiments .",

    "the detection concept of gerda is implemented by operating bare @xmath35ge ( ge detectors enriched in @xmath1ge ) inside a cryostat containing cryogenic liquid argon ( lar ) , surrounded by an additional shield of ultra - pure water .",
    "liquid argon , indeed , acts both as the coolant medium for the @xmath35ge detectors and the shield against external gamma radiation@xcite .",

    "this can be prevented by separating the central volume from the rest of the cryostat by a 3 m high and 750 mm large cylinder , made of a 30 @xmath49 m copper foil ( `` radon shroud '' ) .",
    "a large tank ( 8.5 m high and 10 m of diameter ) filled with ultra - pure water surrounds the cryostat and provides a 3 m thick water buffer around the cryostat .",
    "the water buffer is a multi - purpose medium ; it is used to : ( i ) moderate and absorb neutrons , ( ii ) attenuate the flux of external @xmath50 radiation , ( iii ) provide the cherenkov medium for the detection of muons and ( iv ) provide a backup system for the disposal of the argon gas in case of emergency . to easily insert the detector strings and the calibration sources into the cryostat , without increasing the contamination of the cryogenic volume , a cleanroom and a lock are located on top of the vessel .",
    "the water tank is instrumented with 66 pmts , to detect cherenkov light produced by muon induced showers in the water buffer .",

    "the detector array has a structure made of individual strings , each of them containing up to five independent ge detectors .",
    "the energy scale is determined by calibrating with @xmath51th sources on a weekly basis and was stable during the entire data acquisition period .",
    "indeed , the differences between the reconstructed peaks of the @xmath51th spectrum and the ones from the calibration curves are smaller than 0.3 kev . in the very first phase of gerda data taking ,",
    "a very high background was observed ( 18 @xmath3 10@xmath52 counts/(kev@xmath3kg@xmath3 yr ) ) . also , the line at 1525 kev from @xmath53k , the progeny of @xmath53ar , had an intensity in the energy spectrum much higher than expected@xcite .",
    "these observations suggested the hypothesis that charged ions of @xmath53k drifted in the electric field produced by the 3 to 4 kv bias of the bare ge diodes .",
    "for this reason the strings of detectors were enclosed into 60 @xmath49 m thick copper cylinders ( `` mini - shrouds '' ) .",
    "the measurement of the half - life @xmath54 of two - neutrino double beta decay ( 2@xmath0 ) of @xmath1ge is of extreme interest for different reasons .",
    "firstly , the accurate measurement of 2@xmath0 half - life allows to test the predictions on @xmath55 based on charge exchange experiments@xcite and , therefore , to better understand the nuclear aspects of the decay . secondly , as suggested in refs .",
    ", the nuclear matrix elements @xmath19 and @xmath55 , for 0@xmath0 and 2@xmath0 decays respectively , are related ; therefore , the estimation of @xmath54 can also constrain the value of @xmath19 , that is subject to theoretical uncertainties . the considered gerda data set consists of 8796 events , taken between november 2011 and march 2012 , from the six enriched semi - coaxial detectors , with a total collected exposure of 5.04 kg@xmath3yr .",
