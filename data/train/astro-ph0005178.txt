    "blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) are characterized by their high star formation rate and low chemical abundances .",
    "the high ratio between blue luminosity and hi mass , l@xmath8/@xmath9 , combined with a high relative hi mass fraction , indicates a high star formation efficiency and a high gas consumption rate . the apparent conflict between intense star formation and low chemical abundances",
    "can only be explained if the gas containing the recently produced elements is expelled from the galaxy , if fresh gas is accreted onto the galaxy or if the galaxy is young ( e.g. searle & sargent @xcite ; makarova & karachentsev @xcite ; papaderos et al .",
    "we still have rather vague ideas about what is triggering the intense global burst . our previous observations ( stlin et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) indicate that gas dynamical instabilities in connection with mergers could be the key mechanism . under such circumstances",
    "the heating processes of the ism could become a complicated mixture of shocks caused by infalling clouds and winds from massive young stars and on the other hand a strong radiation field from the starburst .",
    "while optical and radio observations give us important information about the conditions in the hot ionized and the cold neutral gas in star forming galaxies we often lack information about the the ism in the transition zone , the photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "the gas in pdrs contains neutral atoms and ions of low ionization potential ( @xmath10 13.6 ev ) , e.g. c@xmath11 . with the different possible heating mechanisms involved one would expect that the geometry and spatial extension of the ism and the pdrs would be quite different in galaxies like haro 11 and those with quiet star formation activity or with active nuclei , resulting in radically different spectral signatures .",
    "spectral diagnostics are valuable tools in dissecting the balance between different heating and cooling processes and the physical conditions in the gas .",
    "the first observations of [ oi]63@xmath1 in m82 was presented by watson et al .",

    "( @xcite ) for the first time showed that important information about the pdr physics in external galaxies can be obtained from the collisionally excited [ cii]@xmath0158@xmath1 .",
    "later , several studies of star forming regions in the milky way as well as other starburst galaxies and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs , possibly hiding active nuclei ) have demonstrated the power of more detailed far - ir spectroscopy ( e.g. colbert et al .",
    "an advantage with observations in the ir region is that we diminish the influence of dust extinction , allowing a more direct comparison between naked starbursts in low mass galaxies and hidden starbursts in uligs .",
    "the fact that [ cii]@xmath0158@xmath1 emission constitutes the peak of the flux distribution f@xmath12 in starforming galaxies has led to a discussion about the possibility of using [ cii ] to detect young galaxies at high redshifts ( e.g. petrosian et al . @xcite and the detailed discussion by stark @xcite ) . despite some emerging pessimism about this possibility ( gerin & phillips @xcite )",
    "we will argue that this still is a viable idea .    as part of our multifrequency study of three of the most luminous bcgs in the southern hemisphere",

    "we used a scan width of 7 resolution elements , 8 samples per element and fast scanning .",
    "each spectrum was scanned 6 - 111 times with a nominal 0.50 s integration time giving in total an effective integration time of 2820 s.    the data presented in this paper have been taken from pipeline 6.1 .",
    "all the glitches in each individual scan have been removed by using the interactive analysis software package .",
    "about 15% of the total scans were rejected due to heavy cosmic rays contamination .",
    "in addition to the requested data the lws spectrometer provided data on all the other detectors .",
    "these data have been also analyzed and an upper limit on the fine structure line of [ oi]@xmath0145@xmath1 has been derived .",

    "stacey et al . ( @xcite ) studied a mixed sample of spiral galaxies , starburst galaxies , giant molecular clouds and galactic star forming regions and noticed that while there is a linear relation between the energy density of the uv field and the cooling rate of the dust , the efficiency with which the [ cii ] line is excited seems to decrease with the intensity of the uv field .",

    "theoretically it can be understood if the ratio of uv flux to gas density , and thus the dust temperature , becomes high because the dust grains would be more positively charged , forming a stronger coloumb barrier against photoejection .",
    "one should be aware , both as regards the results from malhotra et al . and in the following discussion , that the sample for which useful data are available is quite heterogeneous .",
    "the galaxy types involved range from normal galaxies to seyferts for which the relative importance of different heating sources ( stars and agns ) and different chemical abundances are not satisfactorily controlled .",

    "we found strong correlations ( @xmath114 ) between only three of these parameters : f@xmath6/f@xmath7 , fir / b and the [ cii]/fir ratio .    in figure 4 the trend found by malhotra et al . is confirmed and appears even stronger .",
    "but it is also evident that the position of haro 11 deviates from the envelope defined by the other galaxies .",
    "the possible explanations for the deviant position of haro 11 are either that there is an excess in the [ cii ] over fir luminosity or that the f@xmath6/f@xmath7 temperature is high , or both .",
    "let us look at these two options one at a time .",
    "a consequence of lower metallicity is that the uv photons penetrate deeper into the cloud , thus increasing the volume of the pdr region at the expense of the colder molecular core .",
    "strong observational support of this in terms of a high [ cii]/co flux ratio have been reported by e.g. mochizuki et el .",
    "( @xcite ) , poglitsch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , madden et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , smith & madden ( @xcite ) and israel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "haro 11 behaves in the same way with its extremely high [ cii]/co ratio ( @xmath16 4  10@xmath105 ) .",
    "the interesting question is how much the [ cii]/fir ratio will be influenced by varying metallicity under these conditions .",
    "the models by kaufman et al . show that [ cii]/fir is almost unaffected by metallicity variations in cases where g@xmath14/n have normal values .",
    "this is also in agreement with observations . in 30 dor and the cases discussed by israel et al .",
    "however , the g@xmath14/n ratio is low ( @xmath41 0.1 ) which results in a diluted radiation field , an increased heating efficiency and brighter [ cii ] emission . in haro 11",
    "the g@xmath14/n ratio is normal ( g@xmath14/n=1 cm@xmath72 ) , as seen from table 3 .",
    "so , both observations and modelling argue against an increase in [ cii]/fir in haro 11 due to low metallicity .",
    "there is also another reason . in fig . 5",
    "haro 11 adheres to the other galaxies in the diagram .",
    "therefore as a first guess it is reasonable to assume that [ cii]/fir is normal while f@xmath6/f@xmath7 is deviating .",
    "we concluded in section 3.2 that haro 11 contains very little warm or cold dust .",
    "haro 11 is a merging system of galaxies and it is possible that the merging galaxies have lost their cold dust components , e.g. extended disks , in the merger process .",
    "is it possible that the lack of a normal cold dust component could explain the high f@xmath6/f@xmath7 ratio ?",
    "would the contribution from such a component be sufficient to move the position of haro 11 into the region of the other galaxies ?",
    "it is an important question to ask since it separates global phenomena from local ones .",
    "we have made a rough check of this possibility by selecting the galaxies in the comparison sample having apparent sizes sufficiently large to allow us to obtain iras data both from the very centre and also the integrated iras fluxes of the entire galaxy . in this way we can have an idea about",
    "how much the extended component influences the 60/100 ratio .",
    "it turns out that in the majority of the cases the iras temperature actually _ increases _ when the extended component is included . moreover , for the hottest cases , the hot component is always significantly stronger than the warm / cold component , if existing .",
    "our impression is therefore that the iras temperature of the warm dust of the most active regions in haro 11 and the galaxies below haro 11 in fig .",
    "4 are similar .",
    "although we expect a large scatter in fig . 4 we should examine if there may be other parameters involved ruling the balance between [ cii ] and fir emission and explaining part of the scatter in the diagram and the deviant position of haro 11 .",
    "since both the spectrum of the radiation field and the spatial distribution of gas and dust in general differs between low - mass starbursts and galaxies with agns , we could suspect that we would also find systematic differences in the [ cii]/fir ratios between these types of galaxies . when comparing galaxies classified in the optical region as sy1 , sy2 , liners and hii galaxies we find that the hii galaxies appear to have a broad distribution in f@xmath6/f@xmath7 while the sy2 and liners tend to concentrate towards high iras temperatures and high fir / b .",
    "similarly , in a statistical investigation of the ir / optical properties of bcgs as related to seyfert and liner galaxies ( dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) it was shown that the f@xmath113/f@xmath7 is a powerful index that can be used to discriminate between pure starbursts and cases where agns are important for the radiation field .",
    "several possible physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the trends in [ cii]/fir seen in fig . 4 and 5 ( e.g. malhotra et al .",
    "@xcite ; luhman et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as we already mentioned ,",
    "malhotra et al .",
    "argued that the reduced efficiency in photoejection due to a hard radiation field could be a plausible explanation . the data for haro 11 however , acts as a counterexample of this .",
    "both optical spectroscopy and the hot iras indices indicate a hard radiation field .",
    "still , the [ cii]/fir is close to the values of normal , more passive galaxies .",
    "an alternative explanation , that have been discussed by malhotra et al .",
    "and others is that [ cii ] actually is optically thick in many of the cases where the [ cii]/fir ratio is low .",
    "the general opinion seems to be that the [ cii ] line is optically thin .",
    "these conclusions are based on estimates of the optical depth in a few well known cases , e.g. m82 ( crawford @xcite ) .",
    "but m82 is behaving well in the diagrams ( see fig .",
    "5 ) and the central column density of the gas is not abnormal . from the discussion above we see that , depending on the velocity field and the relative amount of molecular gas in the c@xmath115 zone , the medium could become optically thick in [ cii ] at a column density of n @xmath96 10@xmath116 @xmath47 .",
    "such high numbers can be found in the central regions of some luminous starburst galaxies .",
    "gerin & phillips ( @xcite ) elaborated on the low [ cii]/fir ratio in arp 220 and it is interesting to compare this galaxy with m82 and haro 11 ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "they came to the conclusion that with an estimated column density of n @xmath96 10@xmath117 @xmath47 , the _ dust opacity and emission _ would be sufficiently high to explain at least part of the low value of [ cii]/fir .",
    "but in fact there may be three sources responsible for reducing the ratio : dust opacity , dust emission and self absorption .",
    "what is maybe most important is how to explain why the [ cii]/l@xmath118 ratio decreases with fir / b . therefore the combined effect of dust absorption and [ cii ] selfabsorption should be investigated .",
    "6 shows the same data as in fig . 5 , divided into different galaxy types , sy1 , sy2 , hii and liners .",
    "as we can see , there is a predominance of sy2 galaxies and liners at high fir / b .",
    "most of these galaxies are uligs .",
    "there are strong indications that liners are galaxies with massive nuclear starbursts and likewise some of the sy2 galaxies .",
    "many of these galaxies are probably remnants of massive merges .",
    "even though the luminosity of some of them are not extreme , high column densities could possibly be obtained also in less massive nuclear starbursts , provided they are sufficiently compact .",
    "such very compact nuclear starbursts are preferentially found in the type of galaxy we find at high fir / b in the diagram ( heisler & vader @xcite ) . in a simplified form fig .",
    "6 shows the effect of increasing optical depth on the sample . where the gas is optically thick in [ cii ] the ratio between the [ cii]/b flux ratio should be approximately constant . where it is thin , [ cii]/fir should be constant .",
    "as we can see from figure 4 and 5 , the [ cii ] line in starburst galaxies has a maximum luminosity of a few per mille of the bolometric luminosity and constitutes the peak in the spectral distribution from radio to x - ray .",
    "it has therefore been proposed ( e.g. petrosian et al .",
    "@xcite ; loeb @xcite ; stark @xcite ) that it can be used as a probe in searches for high redshift starburst galaxies . at redshifts of z@xmath119 5 - 6 , where current models of galaxy formation predict the first massive galaxies to form and where optical - near ir observations start to reach the confusion limit , the [ cii ] line is shifted into the submillimeter ( submm ) region and",
    "could be detected with a suitable submm telescope at a cold dry site like the south pole ( stark @xcite ) .",
    "the most interesting targets would probably be massive starburst mergers , characterized by a high 60/100 ratio and a high fir / b ratio .",
    "the tendencies seen in the study of malhotra et al .",
    "( @xcite ) however , have created some pessimism ( e.g. gerin & phillips @xcite ) about the feasibility , due to the rapid decrease in the relative strength of the [ cii ] line with iras temperature .",
    "the properties of haro 11 however , indicate that the conditions may be more promising than anticipated since the [ cii]/l@xmath118 of this galaxy is close to the value obtained for the normal galaxies . if this is due to the low metallicity of the galaxy or not remains to be explored but if so it may apply on distant metal - poor galaxies .",
    "the detection probabilities derived by stark ( @xcite ) predict that it would be quite possible to detect a galaxy with a mass equal to that of a present day l@xmath120 galaxy at z=4 - 5 in a few hours , using a 10 m submm telescope at the south pole . at the formation",
    "epoch a massive galaxy would be several magnitudes brighter than today , i.e. @xmath96 10@xmath121 l@xmath122 .",
    "thus we would need to merge about 10 haro 11 type galaxies to produce this luminosity .",
    "a beam size of 20``-30 '' for a 10 m telescope corresponds to about 100 kpc at the redshift we discuss .",
    "thus it would easily encompass a compact merging group of dwarf galaxies and make a detection feasible .",
    "moreover , with the advent of planned large sub - mm / mm arrays ( e.g. alma ) , the prospects for using the [ cii]158 line as a probe of high redshift starburst would be even more interesting .",
    "we have reported about iso lws observations of the luminous metal poor bcg haro 11 in the three prominent emission lines [ oi]63@xmath1 , [ oiii]88@xmath1 and [ cii]1588@xmath1 .",
    "the galaxy is involved in an intense global starburst probably due to a merger of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the iso data and previous observations in the optical - radio region in combination with model predictions are used to derive information about the physical properties of gas and dust in the galaxy .",
    "haro 11 is one of the hottest iras galaxies observed and we find no trace of cold dust .",
    "most of the neutral hydrogen is confined to the photodissociation regions .",
    "the main part of the gas however , appears to be in ionized or molecular state .",
    "this possibility is generally neglected when discussing the gas content in starburst dwarfs , leading to serious underestimates of the total gas mass .",
    "we also reinvestigate the claimed correlation between [ cii ] emission , far - ir luminosity and the iras 60/100 temperature for a number of starforming galaxies of different types , active and non - active .",
    "we confirm and tighten the correlation and note that haro 11 deviates in the sense that its [ cii]/l@xmath37 is higher than expected .",
    "we argue that this may indicate that the previously preferred explanation of the relationship , a decreasing efficiency with iras temperature in the ejection of photoelectrons from uv - illuminated grains may not be entirely correct .",
    "an alternative , or complementary explanation seems to be that the optical depth increases with increasing iras temperature .",
    "this would be expected if the iras temperature correlates with compactness and/or mass of the central starburst region .",
    "the metallicity may also play an important role , in which case the somewhat pessimistic opinions about using [ cii]158@xmath1 to detect high redshift massive starburst galaxies may not be valid .",
    "the whole situation will probably be clarified once a more representative sample of galaxies , including both normal dwarfs and massive galaxies becomes available .",

    "<S> we discuss the balance between dust and line cooling in the photodissociated regions ( pdr ) , in particular the role of the [ cii]@xmath0158@xmath1 line , and derive the basic properties of the pdr gas and estimates of the gas and dust masses . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the pdrs , 2@xmath2  10@xmath3 , is comparable to that of the ionized gas and exceeds the observed upper limit of the hi mass . </S>",
    "<S> the gas / dust mass ratio is low , indicating that the galaxy contains little cold dust . </S>",
    "<S> the low metallicity , the intense radiation field and the low column density of haro 11 results in an extremely high [ cii]/co flux ratio and probably also a very high ( h@xmath4)/l@xmath5 conversion factor . </S>",

    "<S> we propose that the [ cii]158@xmath1/fir versus f@xmath6/f@xmath7 relationship is caused by an increasing optical depth with increasing iras temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the low metallicity of haro 11 and its extreme starburst properties probably allows the medium to be thin despite its high f@xmath6/f@xmath7 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves room for a more optimistic view on the possibilities to detect massive starforming mergers at high redshifts , using the [ cii ] line .    </S>"
