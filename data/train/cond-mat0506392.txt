    "a macrostate of a system with a large number of degrees of freedom is imperfectly known at the microscopic level .",
    "the system can be found in any dynamic state compatible with the external macroscopic conditions .",

    "the extensive variables can be split into two parts , and they should be proportional to the actual amount of matter present , @xmath23 . on the other hand , the intensive variables have to keep its values and can not depend on the size of the system , @xmath24 . as an example , we may consider the thermodynamic systems which may be fixed in terms of the macroscopic variables of state @xmath25 . in this case , the thermodynamic principle of additivity is implemented if intensive quantities are functions of intensive arguments , and extensive variables are proportional to the number of particles of the system multiplied by the intensive quantity .",

    ", we come to the well - known expression for the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon entropy , @xmath53 . the information entropy ( [ 122 ] ) is known as havrda - charvat - darczy - tsallis entropy ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "note that for the gibbs statistical entropy this problem is inherent as well  @xcite .",
    "in this section , the microcanonical distribution function and the statistical operator will be expressed through the variables of state of the isolated system @xmath66 .",
    "let us consider the equilibrium statistical ensemble of the closed energetically isolated systems of @xmath21 particles at the constant volume @xmath40 and the thermodynamic coordinate @xmath67 .",
    "it is supposed that all systems have identical energy @xmath36 within @xmath68 .    to begin with",
    ", we turn to instances of the classical case .",
    "the tsallis equilibrium statistical entropy  ( [ 126 ] ) represents a function of the parameter @xmath55 and a functional of the equilibrium phase distribution function @xmath15 : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an infinitesimal element of phase space .",

    "in particular , it is a function of the hamiltonian , @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , the hamilton function @xmath75 has the parametrical dependence upon the number of particles @xmath21 , volume @xmath40 of the system and @xmath67 .    for an isolated system , in the state of thermal equilibrium",

    "changes of the variables of state at transition from one equilibrium state to another nearby state are equal to zero , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , from the basic equation of thermodynamics ( [ 115 ] ) it follows immediately that the thermodynamic entropy at the fixed values of @xmath79 is constant : @xmath80 to express the phase distribution function @xmath15 through the variables of state @xmath66 , let us replace the equilibrium thermodynamic entropy @xmath37 of the macroscopic system with the tsallis statistical one ( [ 201 ] ) , @xmath81 , and substitute it in eq .",

    "it is of great interest that both the heat capacity and the temperature sharply change their shape in the region of small values of @xmath149 and considerably defer from their gibbs limit , which in the figure is indicated by arrows . in the region of @xmath194 ,",
    "the heat capacity is negative .",
    "it is remarkable that such a behaviour has really been caused by the decrease of the temperature with @xmath195 .",
    "this dependence can be seen even better in right panel of fig . 1 which shows the temperature vs the specific energy of the system for different values of the parameter @xmath149 . the negative heat capacity in the microcanonical ensemble is closely related to the phase transition of the first order where the entropy is a convex function  @xcite .",
    "1 clearly shows that the variable @xmath149 is the order parameter and the system is physically unstable in the region @xmath194 at the fixed values of the variables @xmath196 , where the entropy is a convex function of @xmath195 .",

    "the equilibrium phase distribution function and the statistical operator do not depend on time , and they are functions of the additive first integrals of motion of the system by virtue of performance of liouville and von neumann equations . additionally , these main quantities are functions of the macroscopic variables of state of the system . to derive the distribution functions , in contrast with the jaynes principle , the new thermodynamic method based on the fundamental equation of thermodynamics and statistical definition of the functions of the state of the system was given .    in this paper",
    ", we have made the following claim .",
    "the index @xmath55 of the tsallis entropy should be an extensive variable of the state of the system . as a result of this assumption",
    ", we obtain that in the microcanonical ensemble the tsallis entropy represents the homogeneous function of the variables @xmath79 of the first order .",
    "the temperature of the system is an intensive variable , and , consequently , the zero law of thermodynamics is satisfied .",
    "other functions of state of the system are either extensive or intensive .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath1 , in the tsallis statistics the thermodynamic principle of additivity is carried out .",
    "note that the tsallis information entropy is nonextensive because the parameter @xmath55 is a certain intensive constant .",
    "also it is necessary to note that the tsallis statistical entropy as well as the gibbs one has an essential lack .",
    "both the entropies do not depend on time while the thermodynamic entropy grows up to achieve its maximal value in the state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the extensive property of the tsallis entropy in the microcanonical ensemble yields the euler theorem which permits one to find the fundamental equation of thermodynamics and the gibbs - duhem relation .",
    "thus , the first and the second principles of thermodynamics are fulfilled . note that in the limit , @xmath179 , all expressions of the tsallis statistics take the form of the conventional gibbs statistical mechanics .",
    "so the tsallis statistical mechanics in the microcanonical ensemble satisfies all postulates of the equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "finally , the classical nonrelativistic ideal gas of @xmath21 identical nucleons in the microcanonical ensemble was considered to illustrate the principles which were elucidated in the general theory .",
    "it has been shown that in the thermodynamic limit the statistical weight , the entropy , the temperature , and other quantities are the homogeneous functions of the first and zero order of the variables of state , respectively .",
    "note that for ideal gas the euler theorem was accomplished and in the limit , @xmath179 , all expressions resembled ones of the gibbs statistics .",
