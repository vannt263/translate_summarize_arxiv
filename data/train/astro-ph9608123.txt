    "since the discovery of antiprotons ( s ) in cosmic rays @xcite , their origin has attracted much interest ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . from a standpoint of cosmology and elementary particle physics",
    ", it would be of great importance to detect or to set a stringent limit on the primary  components from such sources as the annihilation of neutralino dark matter @xcite , evaporating primordial black holes ( pbhs ) @xcite and superconducting cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "no evidence for such primary  components has been obtained so far .    for the very sensitive search for primary s",
    "anticipated in the near future experiments @xcite , a potential source of background could be the secondary s produced by cosmic - ray interactions with interstellar gas , since the models of the cosmic - ray propagation predict the secondary  flux at a level close to the present observations @xcite .",
    "however , the energy spectra of the primary s are generally expected to be rather soft ( i.e. , flux increases with decreasing energy ) , whereas the spectra of the secondary s should steeply fall below 2 gev due to the kinematics of the  production .",
    "the signals of the primary s can , therefore , be searched for in the low - energy regions .    in this letter , we point out that such low - energy portion of the primary s should show a large enhancement toward the solar minimum phase and a rapid decrease afterward , whereas the secondary component , falling steeply below 2 gev , does not significantly vary .",
    "the next solar minimum is expected to arrive in a few years : from the observations of 22-yr solar cycle over the past 45 years by , e.g. , the climax neutron monitor @xcite , one can expect that the next solar minimum should be arriving in the years 1997 to 1998 , which should be followed by a rapid increase of solar activity . the low - energy flux of the primary s , e.g. , those from evaporating pbhs , would increase by a factor of 5 in 19971998 as compared to the level in 1993 , and would then rapidly decrease by a factor of 15 in 2000 . on the other hand ,",
    "the secondary  component shall remain stable within a factor of 1.5 throughout this period .",
    "therefore the extraction of the primary  components would become possible with precision measurements of the  spectra over the next several years , providing a unique opportunity either to detect or put a stringent limit on the primary  components .",
    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) may exist as a result of initial density fluctuations , phase transitions , or the collapse of cosmic strings in the early universe ( for a review , see ref .",
    "black holes emit particles and evaporate by quantum effects ( hawking radiation ) @xcite ; in particular , pbhs are the only ones with a mass small enough for the quantum emission rate to be significant , possibly producing an observable flux of @xmath1 s @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we investigated low - energy cosmic - ray @xmath0 s from evaporating pbhs using the monte carlo simulation code jetset 7.4 @xcite to obtain the source spectrum of @xmath1 s from pbhs . the local interstellar flux of these @xmath0 s was then calculated using a 3-d monte carlo simulation based on the diffusion model of the cosmic - ray propagation .",
    "the spatial distribution of pbhs was assumed to be proportional to the isothermal distribution of halo dark mass , i.e. , @xmath2 @xcite , where @xmath3 is the galactocentric distance with @xmath4 kpc being the position of the solar system , @xmath5 kpc is the core radius , and @xmath6 gev  @xmath7 is the local halo density .",
    "our 3-d simulation showed that only pbhs within a few kpc of the solar system contribute substantially to the local interstellar @xmath0 flux ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we then found that the local pbh explosion rate , @xmath8 , must be less than @xmath9 pc@xmath10yr@xmath11 in order not to conflict with the bess 93 data @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will show later that future experiments can have sensitivity to @xmath8 value down to @xmath12 of the above upper limit . in this letter",
    ", we use the local interstellar @xmath0 flux obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite after scaling it for an appropriate value of @xmath8 .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) models for particle physics have been extensively studied in recent years @xcite . in most models ,",
    "the lightest neutralino @xmath13 is taken to be stable and thus serve as cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe .",
    "if the neutralinos comprise the galactic halo , their annihilation may produce a detectable flux of @xmath1 s @xcite , since a pair of neutralinos annihilates into quarks , leptons , gauge bosons or higgs bosons , which then decay or fragment into various particles including @xmath1 s .",
    "here we study this process in the framework of minimal @xmath14 supergravity models with radiative breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry @xcite . in this framework",
    ", one can calculate all susy particle masses and couplings by solving the renormalization group equations with only four susy soft breaking parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the higgsino mass parameter @xmath19 is also determined , except for its sign , from the requirement of the electroweak gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "we assume @xmath19 to be positive , and the top quark mass to be @xmath20 gev .",
    "part of the parameter space has already been excluded by theoretical and experimental bounds , including recent results of searches for susy particles at tevatron @xcite and lep 1.5 @xcite .",
    "we then compute the value of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the neutralino relic density in units of the critical density of the universe and @xmath23 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km  s@xmath11mpc@xmath11 . recently , berezinsky et al .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the expected value of @xmath21 falls within the range of @xmath24 in most cosmological models from the viewpoint of the age of the universe .",
    "thus , we choose here four representative parameter sets which give @xmath25 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "neutralino dark matter with this value of @xmath21 is most likely pure bino , and annihilates predominantly into bottom quarks ( @xmath26 ) or tau leptons ( @xmath27 ) .    to obtain the source spectrum of @xmath1 s from the neutralino annihilation , we use the fragmentation functions extracted from jetset 7.4 @xcite .",
    "since most of the @xmath0 s are produced as the fragments of @xmath26 ( no @xmath0 from @xmath27 ) , the shape of their source spectrum does not depend much on the parameter set , although its absolute value scales with @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the neutralino annihilation rate per unit volume and @xmath30 is the branching ratio into @xmath26 . the local interstellar flux of these @xmath0 s is then calculated using a 3-d monte carlo simulation based on the diffusion model , as in the case of evaporating pbhs .",
    "note that , whereas the emission rate from evaporating pbhs per unit volume is proportional to their density , @xmath29 is proportional to the _ squared _ neutralino density ; thus the local flux of @xmath0 s from the neutralino annihilation is rather sensitive to the halo density distribution .",
    "we will show later that the flux of @xmath0 s from the neutralino annihilation is usually too small to be observed under conventional astrophysical assumptions , i.e. , if the neutralino has the homogeneous , spherical and isothermal distribution with @xmath6 gev  @xmath7 .",
    "there are , however , at least three astrophysical uncertainties which possibly increase the @xmath0 flux by a factor of @xmath31 : first , the galactic halo may be flattened toward the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "this shall increase the local halo density @xmath32 by a factor of @xmath33 over that of a spherical halo @xcite , resulting in the enhanced annihilation rate by a factor of @xmath34 .",
    "secondly , a non - dissipative gravitational singularity ( ngs ) may reside at the galactic center ( gc ) @xcite , resulting in the halo density distribution being @xmath35 for @xmath36 pc .",
    "if this is the case , the neutralino annihilation rate would be very high at the gc .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath3-distribution of the primary sources ( the neutralino annihilation and evaporating pbhs ) which contribute to the integrated @xmath0 flux at the solar system .",
    "it can be seen that , whereas only the annihilation occurring within a few kpc of the solar system would contribute in the case of the isothermal density distribution , in the ngs model , @xmath0 s from the annihilation at the gc would dominate the local interstellar @xmath0 flux , leading to @xmath37 .",
    "thirdly , high - density cdm clumps with a density enhancement factor of @xmath38@xmath39 might be generated in the early universe @xcite .",
    "if a small portion ( a few % ) of neutralino dark matter is in the form of such clumps , the expected @xmath0 flux could be enhanced by a factor of @xmath40 @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "if there exists such a clump in the vicinity of the solar system , the resultant @xmath0 flux at the earth could be further enhanced by a large factor .",
    "when high - energy cosmic rays interact with the interstellar gas , secondary particles are produced including s .",
    "the expected flux of such secondary s was calculated by a number of authors @xcite who showed that the expected energy spectrum of the secondary s drops off steeply below 2 gev .",
    "this feature originates from the kinematics of the  production , and is independent of the details of the cosmic - ray propagation .",
    "recently , one of us has calculated the secondary  fluxes @xcite using the two models of the cosmic - ray propagation , i.e. , the standard leaky box ( slb ) @xcite and diffusive reacceleration ( dr ) @xcite models , by taking the most plausible input data such as the parent proton flux .",
    "the resultant spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] have very similar shapes , although the absolute flux in the slb model is 2.5 times larger than that in the dr model .",
    "when antiprotons go into the solar system , their energy spectra are changed due to the diffusion , convection , and deceleration processes by the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field ( solar modulation ) .",
    "the minimal model to describe the processes is the spherically symmetric model @xcite , in which all quantities are dependent only on the heliocentric distance @xmath41 . at the boundary of the heliosphere ( @xmath42 )",
    "the cosmic - ray energy spectrum is assumed to match the interstellar spectrum .",
    "the energy spectrum at the earth ( @xmath43 ) can then be calculated by solving the diffusion - convection equation @xcite using the numerical technique developed by fisk @xcite .    as usual ,",
    "we take the solar wind speed @xmath44 km / s and the radius of the heliosphere @xmath45 au . since it was shown @xcite that the spectrum at the earth is not significantly affected by the position dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath46 , we take @xmath46 to be position independent and , as normally done , to be proportional to the particle rigidity @xmath47 as well as to the speed @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 , where the coefficient @xmath50 varies with solar activity . the solar activity level",
    "is then represented by a single parameter : @xmath51 which roughly corresponds to the `` @xmath52 parameter '' in the force field approximation @xcite , i.e. , the energy loss in the heliosphere per particle charge . with @xmath53 varying between @xmath54 and @xmath55 mv from the solar minimum to the maximum , this model reproduces well @xcite the large variation ( a factor of 20 ) of low - energy proton and helium fluxes as well as each energy spectrum at various stages of solar activity .",
    "since the soft energy spectra of the primary @xmath0 s are similar to those of proton and helium , we use this model of solar modulation to calculate the solar - modulated spectra of the primary @xmath0 s .    to forecast the time variation of @xmath53",
    ", we can utilize the data of the climax neutron monitor @xcite , because the @xmath53 parameter shows the excellent correlation with the count rate of the neutron monitor @xcite .",
    "the climax data over the past 45 years clearly show 22-yr solar cycle .",
    "especially the recent trend of the data shows strong similarity to those in @xmath56 . from this",
    ", one would expect the next solar minimum in the years 1997 to 1998 with the @xmath53 parameter reaching @xmath54 mv , which should be followed by a rapid increase of solar activity ( @xmath57 mv ) in 2000 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) shows examples of the primary  fluxes as well as the two secondary  fluxes ( slb and dr ) solar - modulated with @xmath58 , 550 , and 1000 mv , which would correspond to 1997 , 1995 , and 2000 respectively . the uppermost curves ( @xmath59 ) represent the interstellar spectra .",
    "we have taken @xmath60 pc@xmath10yr@xmath11 for the  flux from evaporating pbhs , and the case  # 1 with @xmath61 for the  flux from the neutralino annihilation .",
    "it should be noted @xcite that the secondary  fluxes are rather insensitive to the solar modulation .",
    "this is because the interstellar fluxes decrease with decreasing energy below 2 gev so that the two effects of the solar modulation , i.e. , deceleration and flux suppression cancel each other .",
    "contrastingly , the primary  fluxes would show a large enhancement toward the solar minimum in a very similar way to the proton flux . note",
    "that even the `` enhanced '' solar minimum fluxes of the primary s are very much suppressed as compared to the interstellar fluxes .",
    "based on the present understanding of the cosmic - ray propagation , we expect that the secondary antiprotons will most likely exist .",
    "therefore , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) the solar - modulated ( @xmath62 and 1000 mv )  fluxes in three cases , i.e. , ( i ) secondary ( in the slb model ) only , ( ii ) secondary ( slb ) plus s from evaporating pbhs , and ( iii ) secondary ( slb ) plus s from the neutralino annihilation .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ( c ) shows the corresponding spectra with the dr model of the secondary s .",
    "the unknown absolute intensities of the primary  fluxes ( @xmath8 and @xmath63 for pbhs and neutralino dark matter respectively ) were chosen here not to conflict with the existing observations .",
    "note that the value of @xmath8 taken here ( see above ) is 1/3 of the upper limit obtained in our previous paper @xcite using the bess 93 data @xcite .",
    "such a weak signal , however , will appear as a striking enhancement of the low - energy  flux at the solar minimum .",
    "also shown is the expected statistical accuracy estimated for a future measurement by the bess experiment with a total 48-hour flight @xcite .",
    "as seen in these figures , the existence of novel primary  sources at this level could be detected without any ambiguity .",
    "it can also be seen that the signals of the primary s will rapidly diminish after the solar minimum with the increase of solar activity .",
    "this strong variation with solar activity would provide further evidence for the primary s , because the spectra of secondary s are not largely affected by the solar modulation .    in the past ,",
    "the observational data as well as theoretical calculations were usually presented in terms of the /@xmath64 ratio . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the @xmath65 ratio is rather insensitive to the solar modulation of the primary s , since the denominator of proton flux varies in a similar way to the primary  components .",
    "therefore , one has to measure the absolute  flux and its spectrum in order to fully utilize the characteristic solar modulation of the primary s .    finally we discuss the attainable sensitivity to the primary  components expected in the future experiments .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the  spectra corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively , for much smaller contributions of the primary s . as seen in the figures , these small signals can also be detected with the expected accuracy .",
    "the corresponding sensitivity to the pbh explosion rate @xmath8 is @xmath66 pc@xmath10yr@xmath11 in case of the slb model , and @xmath67 pc@xmath10yr@xmath11 in case of the dr model .",
    "these values are respectively 1/17 and 1/34 of the best existing upper limit derived from the bess 93 data .",
    "note that the explosion rate @xmath68 pc@xmath10yr@xmath11 is 9 orders of magnitude lower than the upper limit obtained from searches for tev @xmath69-ray bursts @xcite , and is a few hundreds times lower than the upper limit derived from the anisotropy of the diffuse @xmath69-ray flux @xcite . on the standard assumption of the pbh initial mass spectrum @xcite , this value of @xmath8 corresponds to the average pbh density in the universe of @xmath70 , which is a factor of @xmath71 below the upper limit deduced from the cosmological diffuse @xmath69-ray background @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] also shows that , in order for the @xmath0 flux from the neutralino annihilation to be observable for the case  # 1 , the enhancement factor @xmath63 must be greater than 8 and 4 when the slb and dr models , respectively , are used for the secondary @xmath0 s . since such enhancement is possible within astrophysical uncertainties as discussed in section 3 , @xmath0 s from the neutralino annihilation",
    "could be observed in the near future .    in conclusion ,",
    "if future experiments allow us to precisely measure the low - energy cosmic - ray  flux at the solar minimum , we should be able to conduct a very sensitive search for primary @xmath0 components by utilizing the characteristic solar modulation of the primary s .",
    "we are grateful to all the members collaborating on the bess experiment .",
    "sincere thanks are due to m. drees and m.m .",
    "nojiri for allowing us to use their routines to calculate the neutralino relic density .",
