    "_ note _ , that @xmath86^+\\#^+[c]$ ] except for the case of fundamental group @xmath87 in general does not belong to the kernel of the above epimorphism , so @xmath38 is really a monoid ( see example [ nocont ] ) .",
    "homotopic cycles are homologous , so we have a well - defined map of sets @xmath89 .    for any class @xmath9\\in\\pi_k(m;d)$ ] the product @xmath9^+\\#^+[c]$ ]",
