    ", our knowledge of the mass spectrum of stellar bhs is hampered by the uncertainties about two issues : ( i ) mass losses by stellar winds in massive stars ( during and especially after the main sequence , ms ) ; ( ii ) the hydrodynamics of core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "the rate of mass loss by stellar winds during the ms likely increases with the metallicity of the star ( @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , depending on the model , e.g. kudritzki , pauldrach & puls 1987 ; leitherer , robert & drissen 1992 ; maeder 1992 ; kudritzki & puls 2000 ; vink , de koter & lamers 2001 ; kudritzki 2002 ; belkus , van bever & vanbeveren 2007 ; pauldrach , vanbeveren & hoffmann 2012 ) . the behaviour of post - ms massive stars , such as luminous blue variable stars ( lbvs ) and wolf - rayet stars ( wrs ) , is much more uncertain ( e.g. vink & de koter 2005 ) .    according to models of stellar evolution and sn explosion ( fryer 1999 ; fryer & kalogera 2001 ; woosley , heger & weaver 2002 ; heger et al .",

    "the actual value of the minimum final mass for a star to directly collapse into a bh is quite uncertain : our adopted fiducial value of 40 m@xmath2 is a conservative assumption ( fryer 1999 ) , and searches for sn progenitors provide some evidences for this theoretical scenario ( see smartt 2009 for a recent review ) . since",
    "stellar winds are suppressed at low metallicity , metal - poor massive stars are more likely to have @xmath30 m@xmath2 than their metal - rich analogues .    in the case of a failed sn , it is reasonable to expect that the mass of the remnant is comparable to the final mass of the progenitor star ( or at least more than half of it , see e.g. heger et al .",

    "l10 adopt recipes for stellar winds and failed sne that are very similar to b10 , and find that msbhs are unlikely to power bright x - ray binaries .",
    "this occurs because primordial binaries merge if they are sufficiently tight to enter a common envelope ( ce ) phase before the sn of the primary and if they are still in roche lobe overflow ( rlo ) at the end of the ce phase .",
    "if they survive the ce phase , they may be tight enough to later enter a rlo phase when the secondary evolves , but typically their bhs are small , as a consequence of the mass lost during ce . in both cases ,",

    "do not include the effects of dynamics on the evolution of primordial binaries and on the formation of new binaries .",
    "this is a strong limitation , as most stars ( @xmath31 per cent ) likely form in scs ( e.g. lada & lada 2003 ) , and most scs are collisional environments , that is sites where close encounters between stars and binaries ( three - body encounters ) are extremely frequent and have important consequences ( see , e.g. bonnell & kroupa 1998 , for a review dedicated to young scs ) .",
    "binaries are important for close encounters , because they have a larger cross - section than single stars and because they have an energy reservoir ( their internal energy ) , which can be exchanged with single stars ( e.g. heggie 1975 ; heggie & hut 1993 ; davies 1995 ; colpi , mapelli & possenti 2003 ) .",
    "close encounters with single stars statistically lead to the increase ( decrease ) of the binding energy of a hard ( soft ) binary , defined as a binary with binding energy higher ( lower ) than the average kinetic energy of a star in the sc ( heggie 1975 ) .",
    "close encounters can even unbind binaries ( ionization ) .",
    "dynamical exchanges are also possible , that is interactions where one of the former members of the binary is replaced by the single star ( for a description of the possible outcomes of a binary - single star interaction , see , e.g. sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ) .",
    "finally , recoil velocities due to three - body encounters can cause the ejection of the star and/or of the binary from the parent cluster ( see section  4.1 of sigurdsson & phinney 1993 for a general definition of recoil velocity in three - body encounters ) .",

    "the main differences between this paper and b06 are the following .",
    "firstly , our treatment of dynamics is fully @xmath0body , rather than based on a hybrid code .",
    "secondly , in our simulations msbhs form self - consistently , as a consequence of metallicity - dependent stellar evolution and dynamics , whereas b06 generate one imbh per cluster , following recipes from runaway - merger simulations .",

    "we assume that all stars with final mass @xmath54 m@xmath2 collapse quietly to a bh , without sn explosion ( fryer 1999 ; fryer & kalogera 2001 ) , and that all the bhs born in this way do not receive any natal kicks ( see fryer et al .",

    "the step is produced by the minimum value of @xmath66 for which @xmath54 m@xmath2 and the direct collapse takes place , at a given metallicity .",
    "the main differences between our treatment of the collapse and that by b10 are that ( i ) b10 do not use the total final mass @xmath67 to discriminate between direct collapse and ` standard ' sn , but the mass of the co core , assuming that all stars with final co mass @xmath68 m@xmath2 collapse directly to a bh ; ( ii ) b10 adopt slightly different recipes for fallback ( see portegies zwart & verbunt 1996 and belczynski et al .",
    "2008 for details ) .    because of these differences , in our simulations fallback is less efficient for zams masses in the @xmath69 m@xmath40 range .",
    "furthermore , the maximum mass of bhs for @xmath70 is higher ( by a factor of 1.4 ) in our simulations with respect to b10 results .",

    "one of the simplifying approximations in our model ( as well as in b10 ) is that stars do not rotate .",
    "rotation may have important effects both on the mass loss of the progenitor star , inducing rotational mixing ( e.g. , maeder & meynet 2010 , 2012 , and references therein ) , and on the formation of the bh , producing asymmetries in the collapse ( e.g. fryer & heger 2000 ; akiyama et al .",

    "how the effects of rotation affect the mass spectrum of bhs is debated and highly uncertain ( e.g. dessart , oconnor , & ott 2012 ; maeder & meynet 2012 ) . including the effects of rotation in our model",
    "requires a significant revision of the adopted recipes for stellar evolution and wind mass losses , which goes beyond the aims of the current paper .",
    "we will investigate the effects of rotation in a forthcoming paper .",
    "for the evolution of binaries we maintain the recipes already present in the original version of seba ( portegies zwart & verbunt 1996 ) .",
    "in particular , seba distinguishes among the evolution of detached binaries ( where both stars are smaller than their roche lobes ) , that of semi - detached binaries ( one of the components fills its roche lobe ) and that of contact binaries ( both stars fill their roche lobe ) . in the case of detached binaries ,",
    "mass loss and accretion can occur via stellar winds ( according to the formulation by livio & warner 1984 ) . in the case of semi - detached binaries , either stable or unstable",
    "rlo takes place , according to the formalism described in appendix  c of portegies zwart & verbunt ( 1996 ) .",
    "if the accretor is a bh , the maximum mass - accretion rate of the bh is constrained by the requirement that the luminosity does not exceed the eddington limit .",

    "after the first @xmath10 myr of the cluster lifetime ( when the turn - off mass goes below @xmath221 m@xmath2 ) , single msbhs are among the most massive objects in the sc and are likely to replace the lowest - mass members of primordial binaries .",
    "\\(ii ) the cross section for three - body interactions is larger for more massive binaries ( see e.g. sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ; davies , benz & hills 1994 ; davies 2002 ; miller & hamilton 2002 ) . after the first @xmath10 myr of the cluster lifetime ,",
    "msbh binaries become significantly more massive than the other binaries in the sc . thus , their rate of three - body encounters is higher than that of low - mass binaries .",
    "\\(iii ) hard binaries tend to harden as a consequence of three - body encounters , i.e. to reduce their semi - major axis @xmath94 ( e.g. heggie 1975 ; heggie & hut 1993 ; davies 1995 ; quinlan 1996 ; merritt 2001 ) .",
    "the decrease of @xmath94 can start rlo into a bh binary .",
    "a msbh binary in our simulated scs is hard if @xmath222 a.u.@xmath223 ( corresponding to a period @xmath224 yr@xmath223 ) .",
    "therefore , most of the msbh binaries in our simulations are hard . combining stellar evolution with the above notions from the theory of three - body encounters , we can summarize the evolution of the simulated bhs as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the main differences between msbhs and low - mass bhs , relatively to the flow chart in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] . case a : the bh forms from a single star .",
    "if the bh is a msbh , then the exchange probability @xmath216 is very high already after @xmath185 myr since the sc formation , and the msbh becomes soon a binary member via dynamical exchange .",
    "the resulting msbh binary undergoes efficiently three - body encounters and hardens rapidly .",
    "if the bh has relatively low mass , its @xmath216 is low for most of the sc life : the low - mass bh can remain single for a much longer time , or even for the entire lifetime of the cluster .",
    "furthermore , low - mass bhs are more easily ejected out of the sc .",
    "case b : the bh forms from a primordial binary . depending on the initial semi - major axis of the binary and on the stellar evolution , the binary can merge or avoid merger before the formation of the bh . if the binary merges before the formation of the bh ( case b1 ) , then the bh forms as a single object and its evolution is the same as in the case a.    if the binary does not merge before the formation of the bh ( case b2 ) , then there are at least three possibilities . case b2.1 : the sn kick of the primary unbinds the binary . in this case , the bh is substantially a single object and behaves as in case  a. in our simulations , this case can occur only for low - mass bhs , as msbhs are assumed to form without natal kick .",
    "case b2.2 : the binary remains bound and the stellar evolution of the secondary is faster than three - body encounters .",
    "this occurs especially when the binary is very close and/or the mass of the secondary is similar to the mass of the primary . for binaries where the radius of the secondary star is close to the roche lobe at the time of formation of the bh ,",
    "the binary enters a rlo phase because of the evolution of the secondary .",
    "as already shown by l10 , msbhs can hardly form in such close binaries , because the first ce phase leads generally to the formation of small bhs . therefore , this case is more frequent for low - mass bhs .",
    "case b2.3 : the binary remains bound and three - body encounters are more efficient than the stellar evolution of the secondary .",
    "this occurs especially for relatively wide binaries ( where stellar evolution is not sufficient to drive rlo ) , and/or for low - mass secondary stars , which evolve much more slowly than the primary . in this case",
    ", the evolution is very different depending on the mass of the bh and depending on whether the binary is hard or soft . in the following ,",
    "we mention only three of the possible cases ( the most relevant for our simulations ) .",
    "\\(i ) if the binary is soft ( unlikely if a msbh is member of the binary ) , three - body encounters are expected to ionize it .",
    "\\(ii ) if the bh is a msbh and the binary is relatively hard , then three - body encounters harden the binary .",
    "exchanges can occur , but are unlikely to remove the msbh from the binary , as it is more massive than most single stars .",
    "the msbh binary survives and may undergo mt .",
    "\\(iii ) if the bh has a low mass ( lower than the companion mass ) and the binary is relatively hard , then three - body encounters harden the binary , but exchanges can remove the bh from the binary .",
    "if it is expelled by an exchange , the bh becomes single again .",
    "we stress that the flow chart in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] is schematic and somehow simplistic , as it neglects some further effects that can take place ( e.g. the sn explosion of the companion star , the formation of a binary composed of two compact objects , the definitive ejection of the bh from the sc ) . despite this , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] allows to understand why exchanges are so important to enhance the formation and evolution of msbh binaries ( see table  3 ) .",
    "in fact , msbhs evolve predominantly from case  a ( i.e. they form from single stars ) to case b2.3 , where exchanges and three - body encounters dominate the evolution of a hard and massive msbh binary .",
    "it clarifies also why most low - mass bhs start rlo immediately after their formation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) , whereas msbhs enter rlo much later than their formation ( @xmath225 myr after the beginning of the simulation ) .",
    "in fact , it is unlikely for msbhs to evolve through case b2.2 and to start rlo because of the stellar evolution of the secondary star in a primordial binary .",
    "msbhs evolve mainly through case a and case b2.3 : they can efficiently acquire ( new ) companions because of dynamical exchanges , and their binaries harden because of three - body encounters . on the other hand ,",
    "dynamical interactions occur on a longer timescale ( a few tens myr ) than massive star evolution .    instead , low - mass bhs evolve mainly through case a , case b2.2 and case b2.3 . in case",
    "a , low - mass bhs remain likely single objects , as the probability of an exchange into a binary is low .",
    "case b2.2 can lead to mt on the timescale of massive star evolution .",
    "case b2.3 can result in the ejection of the low - mass bh from the binary , as a consequence of dynamical exchanges .",
    "therefore , most of the rlo systems powered by low - mass bhs evolve as described in case b2.2 , and only a few of them through case b2.3 .      to describe the evolution of mass accretion and the emission properties of rlo binaries is beyond the scope of this paper . on the other hand , from the simulations described in the previous sections",
    ", we can extract some basic hints about the evolution of rlo binaries .",
    "the code we use limits the accretion rate so that the luminosity of the binary can not exceed the eddington limit for bhs .",
    "we prefer not to change this assumption and not to introduce arbitrary rules for super - eddington accretion , as the dynamical code is not sufficiently accurate to distinguish between different accretion models . in a forthcoming paper , we will re - simulate the mt systems obtained from this study , without accounting for three - body encounters but with a more accurate recipe for the mt rate ( e.g. patruno & zampieri 2008 ) .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] shows the eddington luminosity ( @xmath226 ) for the simulated rlo systems .",
    "there are important differences between the solar - metallicity simulations and the two sub - solar environments , although the statistics is quite low .",
    "no rlo systems formed at @xmath227 have @xmath228 erg s@xmath34 ( corresponding to a bh mass @xmath229 m@xmath40 ) .",
    "rlo systems formed at @xmath230 and @xmath231 reach @xmath232 erg s@xmath34 and @xmath233 erg s@xmath34 , respectively ( corresponding to bh mass @xmath234 and 58 m@xmath40 , respectively ) .",
    "the mass spectrum of bhs born from the collapse of massive stars is very uncertain .",
    "recent theoretical studies ( e.g. mapelli et al . 2009 ; zampieri & roberts 2009 ; b10 ) indicate that the mass of the bh depends on the metallicity of the progenitor star and that metal - poor massive stars can produce msbhs with a mass as high as @xmath235 m@xmath2 ( for @xmath231 ) .",
    "observational results suggest that low - metallicity environments host more massive bhs than the mw ( e.g. prestwich et al .",
    "2007 ) and highlight a possible anti - correlation between the population of bright x - ray sources ( especially ulxs ) and the metallicity of the host galaxy ( e.g. mapelli et al .",
    "2010 , 2011a ) .    however , it is still unclear whether theoretically predicted msbhs are efficient in powering x - ray sources .",
    "studies based on population synthesis codes ( e.g. l10 ) , including metallicity effects but neglecting dynamical interactions , find that msbhs can hardly power bright x - ray sources , because of various effects connected with binary evolution .    in this paper , we present preliminary simulations run with a @xmath0body plus stellar and binary evolution code , based on the public version of starlab .",
    "these simulations include metallicity - dependent stellar evolution , binary evolution and an accurate treatment of three - body encounters .",
    "we simulate dense young scs with three different metallicities : @xmath231 , @xmath230 and @xmath227 .",
    "our simulations show that the dynamics is essential to map the population of bh binaries and that of x - ray binaries in young scs .",
    "firstly , the rate of bh binaries formed through dynamical exchanges is very high for all the considered metallicities .",
    "secondly , the hardening of the binary due to three - body encounters is an important mechanism to induce rlo in binaries hosting bhs .",
    "the role of dynamics is particularly important for msbhs . in scs with @xmath3 and 0.1 z@xmath2 , about 75 per cent of simulated msbhs form from single stars and become members of binaries through dynamical exchanges in the first 100 myr of the sc life",
    "this is a factor of @xmath6 more efficient than in the case of low - mass ( @xmath7 m@xmath2 ) stellar bhs .",
    "we show that the vast majority of msbhs in rlo binaries originated from single stars and went through a dynamical exchange ( table  3 and section 4.3 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the qualitative predictions from the theory of three - body encounters combined with stellar evolution ( section 4.6 ) .",
    "in fact , the higher is the mass of the bh involved , the more important the effects of dynamics on x - ray binaries , as the rate of three - body encounters scales approximately with the total mass of the binary ( e.g. sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , the probability for a single bh to become a binary member through a dynamical exchange is higher if the mass of the single bh is higher than the mass of one of the two components of the binary ( e.g. hills & fullerton 1980 ) .",
    "therefore , msbhs are even more influenced by dynamics than their low - mass analogues .",
    "our results agree with the basic conclusion by l10 : it is very hard that msbhs power rlo x - ray binaries , if they form in primordial binaries that evolve unperturbed . on the other hand",
    ", we find that the situation is completely different for msbhs that form in dynamically active environments ( such as dense young scs ) .",
    "in these environments , msbhs efficiently power rlo x - ray binaries , as a consequence of dynamical exchanges and three - body encounters , which dramatically alter the orbital properties of primordial binaries .",
    "our results are also in fair agreement with those by b06 , although there are some important differences , as b06 study imbhs born from the runaway collapse in denser scs , do not account for metallicity - dependent stellar evolution , and have a much simplified dynamical treatment .",
    "both our paper and b06 find that bhs with mass @xmath236 m@xmath2 spend a large fraction of the simulated time with a companion star and that these massive bhs can power rlo binaries as a consequence of three - body encounters .",
    "our preliminary results show that the study of msbhs is very promising , but there is a lot of work still to be done .",
    "first , the sample of msbhs obtained from our simulations is statistically small ( 112 and 118 msbhs for the simulations with @xmath65 and @xmath237 z@xmath40 , respectively ) .",
    "although our main results are physically well motivated and in agreement with previous studies about three - body encounters ( e.g. , hills & fullerton 1980 ; sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ) and population synthesis models ( e.g. l10 ) , a much larger sample is required to study in detail the properties of msbhs in rlo binaries . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", different models of stellar evolution and especially of mass loss by stellar winds need to be investigated with the same approach . different environments ( not only dense young scs , but also globular clusters and open clusters ) need to be studied with larger statistics .",
    "furthermore , in this paper we assume a primordial binary fraction @xmath90 .",
    "higher binary fractions are not unrealistic ( e.g. delgado - donate et al . 2004 ; ivanova et al . 2005 ; sollima et al . 2010 ) and must be considered in future simulations .",
    "the code described in this paper traces accurately the dynamics of close encounters , but adopts simplified recipes for stellar and binary evolution , as well as for mt .",
    "the mt systems individuated by our simulations will be re - simulated with more accurate binary evolution codes , to trace how they evolve , which are their expected emission features and whether they can explain a fraction of the ulxs .",
    "a fundamental question is where we can search for msbhs .",
    "mw globular clusters can reach metallicities as low as @xmath231 .",
    "thus , they may host msbhs , single or with low - mass companions",
    ". metallicities of the order of @xmath238 are not infrequent in nearby irregular galaxies ( e.g. ic  10 ) , which are good candidates to further investigate the metallicity@xmath153bh mass connection .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for her / his critical reading of the manuscript , which improved it .",

    "some interesting considerations can be drawn from the comparison of table  a1 with table  2 .",
    "first , the number of bhs per cluster is about 10 per cent lower than in the case with @xmath90 .",
    "this is because a number of bhs form from the merger of relatively small stars ( 13 - 25 m@xmath40 ) in primordial binaries , if @xmath240 .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : figa1 ] , where the initial mass spectrum of bhs in the runs with @xmath90 and with @xmath239 are compared .",
    "no bhs with mass @xmath241 m@xmath2 form in the case with @xmath239 , whereas all the bhs with mass @xmath242 m@xmath2 formed in the runs with @xmath90 are remnants of merged progenitors .",
    "we stress that the mass of bhs born from merged progenitors depends strongly on the assumptions about mass loss during the merger .",
    "the fraction of bhs that become members of a binary at least once in the simulation ( @xmath127 ) in table  a1 is almost the same as in table  2 . on the other hand , @xmath243 by construction in the case with @xmath239 .",
    "thus , the number of exchanges that produce bh binaries is higher if @xmath239 .",
    "similarly , the average number of exchanges per binary ( @xmath129 ) is almost double in the case of @xmath239 than in the case of @xmath90 .",
    "these results indicate that exchanges involving bhs are more numerous if @xmath239 .",
    "furthermore , the properties of accreting bh binaries are considerably affected by the assumed fraction of primordial binaries .",
    "wind - accreting systems and especially rlo systems are strongly suppressed if @xmath239 .",
    "this can be easily understood in light of the formation mechanism of binaries . if primordial binaries are allowed to form , then a number of primordial binary systems are expected to be sufficiently close to start rlo at early times , as a consequence of stellar evolution . in the absence of primordial binaries",
    ", binaries can form only through the dynamical interaction of three single stars ( hereafter , three - body capture ) and through a tidal interaction between two single stars ( hereafter , tidal capture ) .",
    "three - body capture binaries are generally wide and eccentric ( hut et al .",
    "1992 ) , whereas tidal - capture binaries are very hard and generally merge ( e.g. , portegies zwart et al .",
    "these two mechanisms are unlikely for most of the sc life , but are enhanced during core collapse ( spitzer 1987 ) . in our simulations",
    ", we do not include any recipes for tidal - capture binaries .",
    "thus we have only three - body capture binaries . only a small fraction ( @xmath244 ) of bh binaries",
    "born from three - body capture survives ionization and becomes hard enough ( through three - body encounters ) to start rlo within 100 myr since the beginning of the simulation .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",

    "in fact , the fraction of rlo systems powered by msbhs ( @xmath245 ) is about twice as high as the fraction of msbhs with respect to all bhs ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "the bias towards high bh masses in rlo systems appears even more evident if we look at fig .",
    "[ fig : figa2 ] : all the bhs powering rlo systems have masses @xmath247 m@xmath2 .",
    "this is a strong confirmation that the more a bh is massive , the more its chances of entering a binary by dynamical exchange are high .",
    "finally , table  a2 shows some of the most relevant properties of msbhs in the runs with @xmath239 . from the comparison with table",
    "3 , it is apparent that more msbhs can form in the absence of primordial binaries ( @xmath248 and 1.18 if @xmath239 and 0.1 , respectively ) . if @xmath240 , the mass loss following the ce phase in a primordial binary tends to produce smaller bh masses",
    "finally , the fraction of rlo systems powered by msbhs is a factor of 10 smaller if @xmath239 than if @xmath90 .    in summary ,",

    "the fraction of msbhs that power rlo systems is much smaller in table  b1 than in table  2 ( 0.04 versus 0.24 ) .",
