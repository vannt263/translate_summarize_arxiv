    "during the last years a growing attention has been paid to analysis of gravita - tional - wave perturbations propagating on cosmological backgrounds .",
    "the motivation stems not only from theoretical considerations concerning the influence of primordial gravitational waves on the cosmological evolution , in particular on the cmb anisotropies , but also from the emerging field of gravitational - wave astronomy which stimulates studies on stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves ( see , e.g. , @xcite for number of references ) .",
    "many years ago isaacson introduced and developed an interesting gauge invariant perturbation approach that enables one to study properties of high - frequency gravitational waves , together with their influence on the background in which they propagate @xcite .",
    "the complete isaacson s formalism thus consistently combines the equation for high - frequency waves with the equation describing back - reaction of the waves on the background .",
    "recently we investigated this effect using the wkb form of the gravitational - wave perturbations @xcite and we presented relations between these solutions and some exact radiative cosmological models .",
    "it is rather surprising that the isaacson wave equation itself did not attract much attention . to our knowledge",
    "it was solved ( in fact , by several authors @xcite ) basically in case of the robinson - trautman spacetimes , the vaidya solution in particular .",
    "however , such spacetimes are usually considered as a model of spherical gravitational waves generated by a `` local source '' rather than a cosmological model .",
    "the purpose of our present work is to solve the isaacson wave equation describing propagation of high - frequency waves on `` genuine '' cosmological backgrounds ( without , however , considering the back - reaction ) .    after summarizing the isaacson formalism ( section  2 ) we apply it to some fundamental cosmological models ( section  3 ) .",
    "general family of the friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker spacetimes is studied in subsection  3.1 . by decomposing the high - frequency perturbations into tensor harmonics",
    "we derive the evolution equation for various permitted gravitational waves .",
    "in particular , illustrative explicit solutions are presented for the de  sitter and anti ",
    "de  sitter universes using various metric forms of these spacetimes . in subsection  3.2",
    "we investigate possible high - frequency gravitational waves in the kasner universe which is a classic representative of anisotropic but homogeneous cosmological models .",
    "isaacson s perturbation method @xcite is based on decomposition of the spacetime metric @xmath0 into the background metric @xmath1 and its perturbation @xmath2 @xmath3 where , in a suitable coordinate system , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . by definition ,",

    "we analyzed this problem explicitly in @xcite for backgrounds with privileged non - twisting null directions , after simplifying the equations by the wkb approximation .",
