    "graphene , a two - dimensional allotrope of carbon , plays a central role in providing a basis for understanding the electronic properties of other carbon allotropes .",
    "being one of the thinnest and the strongest material ever measured , graphene has attracted the attention of the materials research community@xcite in the recent past .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of graphene is that its low energy dispersion closely resembles the dirac spectrum of massless fermions .",
    "this particular type of dispersion provides a bridge between condensed matter physics and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) for massless fermions .",
    "of course in graphene , the dirac fermions move with a much smaller speed .",
    "because of its unusual electronic and structural flexibility , properties of graphene can be controlled chemically or structurally in many different ways . for example , deposition of metal atoms@xcite on top of the graphene sheet , incorporating other elements like boron and nitrogen@xcite randomly in the parent structure , either interstitially or substitutionally and using different substrates.@xcite because disorder is unavoidable in any material , there has been an increasing interest in understanding how disorder affects the physics of electrons in graphene.@xcite disordered graphene based derivatives can probably be referred to as functionalized graphene suitable for specific applications .",
    " _ graphene paper_\"@xcite is a spectacular example of how important such functionalization could be .",
    "there can be many different sources of disorder in graphene including both intrinsic as well as extrinsic .",
    "intrinsic sources may include surface ripples and topological defects .",
    "extrinsic disorder comes in the form of vacancies , adatoms , quenched substitutional atoms and extended defects such as edges and cracks .",
    "another way of introducing disorder is by ion - irradiation that produces complex defect structures in the graphene lattice.@xcite graphene in an amorphous form may increase the metallicity too.@xcite    to have a theoretical description of graphene s electronic structure , one may begin with the kohn - sham equation and a tight - binding representation whose basis is labeled by the sites of the underlying bravais lattice . disorder may enter the matrix representation of the hamiltonian in two ways : vacancies , dopants and adatoms predominantly cause a random change in the local single - site energy ( disorder in the diagonal terms ) but through the overlap such defects modify the hopping integrals between different sites ( disorder in the off - diagonal terms ) causing an effective random change in the distance or angle between the bonding orbitals .",
    "thus diagonal and off - diagonal disorders simultaneously occur and are correlated .",
    "model calculations which take them to be independent are qualitatively in error . as far as diagonal disorder is concerned",
    ", it acts as a simple chemical potential shift of the dirac fermion i.e. shifts the dirac point locally .",
    "theoretical study of such disorder is rather simple and has indeed received attention and success , reported in literature.@xcite@xmath0@xcite a proper inclusion of off - diagonal disorder , on the other hand , is non - trivial and requires more sophisticated approaches .",
    "0.5 cm     till date there have been numerous attempts at studying the effects of disorder in graphene.@xcite@xmath0@xcite among others , the methods used to study effects of disorder included the averaged t - matrix approximation ( ata)@xcite and the coherent potential approximation(cpa).@xcite the first one is not self - consistent and hence inaccurate .",
    "the latter is a single - site mean field approximation with all its attendant problems.@xcite several others have used exact diagonalization of huge clusters and the real - space recursion of haydock _",
    "et al._@xcite both these techniques actually calculate the density of states ( dos ) for specific configurations of the system followed by direct averaging over a large number of configurations .",
    "since each of the configurations has periodic boundary conditions , the averaged spectral function is always a collection of delta functions and the disorder induced life - time effects can not be probed .",
    "the recursion on the lattice probes mainly the real - space effects of disorder .    from the theoretical perspective , dealing with disorder has had a long history . as mentioned earlier , one of the most successful and frequently used approaches is the single - site , mean field cpa.@xcite however , as the name itself suggests , it is a single site approximation and can not adequately take into account the effects of correlated configuration fluctuations . in particular the cpa is inaccurate at low dimensions . in one dimension",
    "it is shown to be inadequate by dean@xcite some time ago . among the hierarchy of the generalizations of cpa ,",
    "only a few approaches have maintained the necessary herglotz analytic properties and lattice translation symmetry of the configuration averaged green s function .",
    "these include the non - local cpa,@xcite the special quasi - random structures ( sqs),@xcite the locally self - consistent multiple scattering approach ( lsms),@xcite and the three methods based on the augmented space formalism proposed by one of us @xcite : the traveling cluster approximation ( tca),@xcite the itinerant coherent potential approximation ( icpa),@xcite and the augmented space recursion ( asr).@xcite over the years asr has proved to be one of the most powerful techniques , which can accurately take into account the effects of correlated fluctuations arising out of the disorder in the local environment .",
    "this is reflected in a series of studies in the past e.g. the effects of local lattice distortion as in cube,@xcite short - range ordering due to local chemistry,@xcite the phonon problem @xcite with essential off - diagonal disorder in the dynamical matrices , and electrical and thermal transport properties@xcite in disordered alloys .    in this communication",
    ", we present a theoretical tight - binding model to study the effects of disorder in graphene .",
    "disorders studied were mainly of two forms : substitutional disorder @xcite@xmath0@xcite and vacancies.@xcite unlike earlier models , both the diagonal and off - diagonal disorders are included on the same footing .",
    "the present formalism is based on the augmented space recursion.@xcite although recursion has been used to study graphene before , we want to emphasize that in _ all _ those applications recursion was carried out on a hilbert space @xmath1 spanned by the tight - binding basis representing the hamiltonian . in augmented space recursion , we recurse in the space of all possible configurations which the hamiltonian may assume in the disordered system . for a homogeneously disordered binary alloy ,",
    "this configuration space is isomorphic to that of a spin - half ising model .",
    "the augmented space theorem @xcite then connects configuration averages to a specific matrix element in that space of configurations .",
    "the novel approach in this work is that we shall make use of the translation symmetries in augmented space ( for homogeneous disorder ) to carry out recursion in reciprocal space .",
    "this will directly give us the spectral function from which we extract the fuzzy band structure .",
    "the inclusion of the effects of configuration fluctuations of the immediate environment gives us self - energies which are strongly @xmath2 dependent , unlike the cpa . in order to make a systematic study , we present results for combinations of both strong and weak diagonal and off - diagonal disorder .",
    "the combined effects show dramatic changes in the location and topology of the dirac - like dispersion and the dos .",
    "special emphasis has been given to the non - trivial inclusion of off - diagonal disorder , in which case the averaged bloch spectral function comes out to be significantly broadened , multiply peaked , and asymmetric in certain limits where the presence of resonances leads to discontinuous dispersion .",
    "the interesting interplay of the two kinds of disorder on full - widths at half maxima ( fwhm ) ( related to the life - time of bloch electrons in a disordered system ) is also shown .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the basic formalism . sec .",
    "iii is devoted to results and discussions .",
    "concluding remarks are present in sec . iv .",
    "the most general tight - binding hamiltonian for electrons in graphene can be represented as , @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the position of the unit cell of the lattice , @xmath5 denotes the @xmath6-th atom on the @xmath7-th sublattice .",
    "the actual atomic position is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the position of the @xmath6-th atom on the @xmath7-th sublattice .",
    "@xmath10 is the on - site energy describing the scattering properties of the atomic potential at @xmath8 , and @xmath11 is the hopping integral between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the projection and transfer operators in the hilbert space spanned by the tight - binding basis @xmath16 .",
    "the above hamiltonian @xmath17 describes electrons in the original honeycomb lattice of ion - cores , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "the two inequivalent sublattices ( shown by red and blue spheres ) are distinguished from each other .",
    "the underlying bravais lattice is the rhombic lattice shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . looking at fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we can simplify eqn.([eq1 ] ) further and write the hamiltonian elements as @xmath18 matrices :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , instead of being scalar for a single - band problem , are now @xmath18 matrices given by , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the on - site energy on the two sublattices , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the nearest neighbor and the next nearest neighbor hopping energies .",
    "@xmath27 are the hopping matrices between the central site @xmath28 and its four neighboring sites @xmath29 ( in the rhombic lattice ) as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "because the next nearest neighbor hopping @xmath26 is usually very small compared to @xmath25 , we shall treat the disorder effects only in the nearest neighbors .    for a system with substitutional disorder ,",
    "the most general statement we can make is that the occupation of the lattice sites in each inequivalent sublattice can be different . for binary disorder in both the sublattices",
    ", we may introduce two random occupation variables @xmath30 and @xmath31 associated with the sublattices @xmath29 and @xmath32 such that , @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the two types of atoms randomly occupying sublattice @xmath29 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 are those occupying sublattice @xmath32 .",

    "in the following subsections , we shall present our results for graphene with impurities , vacancies , diagonal disorder alone , and with the simultaneous presence of diagonal and off - diagonal disorder .",
    "the effects of various strengths of impurity potentials on two inequivalent sublattices will be shown via changes in the shape of the dos .",
    "the changes in the topology of dirac - cone dispersion , disorder - induced fwhm and the dos will be shown for various strengths of diagonal disorder . in the most general case of diagonal and off - diagonal disorder ,",
    "we consider three interesting limiting cases : ( i ) strong diagonal and weak off - diagonal disorder ( ii ) strong off - diagonal and weak diagonal disorder and ( iii ) strong diagonal as well as off - diagonal disorder .",
    "the interesting interplay between these different kinds of disorder in graphene reveals a discontinuous type of band near the @xmath85-point in the third limiting case .              in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we display the dos with different strengths of the single impurity potentials on different inequivalent sublattices .",
    "the top figure in the middle panel is the dos for pure graphene .",
    "the left and right panels show local dos with a single impurity put on the sublattice @xmath29 or @xmath32 and both respectively .",
    "the strength of the impurity potential ( relative to the host lattice ) increases from top to bottom panels ( i.e. @xmath86 = @xmath87 - @xmath88 = @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "all these calculations are done with a fixed hopping parameter t=1 .",
    "we notice changes in the shape of the hump and the van - hove singularities as the strength of the impurity potential increases .",
    "although the effects are small , but are clearly visible for the case of @xmath86=1.0 , where the local environment around the impurity site feels the strongest scattering . with the introduction of the impurity , the symmetry of the dos around the dirac point is lost . at these impurity levels , both the left and right panels show the formation of an impurity peak near the upper band edge .",
    "with increasing disorder this impurity peak moves into the band and disappears .",
    "again , at these strengths there is no perceptible changes to the linear structure of the dirac point .",
    "similar results have been obtained previously for such models of impurities .",
    "this provides the correctness of our new formulation .",
    "an extension of the single impurity is the single vacancy in the model .",
    "the vacancy is modeled by a site with a large repulsive local potential .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "notice that , with increasing @xmath92 , the rightmost impurity peak at around the top band - edge moves into the band .",
    "most of the changes occur around the dirac point at e=0 . at @xmath93",
    "the symmetry of the dirac point gets broken with the appearance of another mild peak .",
    "the origin of this ` zero mode ' peak has been extensively discussed by pereira _ _",
    "e__t al.@xcite in detail .",
    "this peak grows with increasing disorder until at @xmath94 , where it takes the form of a delta function like structure at the dirac point .",
    "the bottom panel shows the result for an ideal vacancy , where @xmath95 for @xmath25 connecting the vacancy to the graphene lattice , or in other words a completely inaccessible ` hard ' vacancy .",
    "the symmetry of the dirac point is restored and the vacancy peak sits exactly at the dirac point .",

    "e__t al.@xcite who used either the cpa or direct real space recursion .",
    "first we shall take up purely diagonal disorder problems : those problems which can be taken up by earlier suggested methodologies .",
    "of course , our augmented space recursion in reciprocal space give us additional information about the disorder induced life - times of the bloch states . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we display the configuration averaged bloch spectral function ( upper panels ) ( given by eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) ) and the corresponding dispersion energy vs. @xmath96 ( lower panels ) along @xmath97 symmetry line for three different alloys a@xmath98b@xmath99 ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) with various diagonal disorder strengths .",
    "the two sublattices @xmath29 and @xmath32 are homogeneously disordered , such that @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 . for each alloy case , the panels from top to bottom indicate the results with increasing strength of diagonal disorder ( i.e. @xmath66= @xmath106 = @xmath107 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "the hopping integral @xmath25 is chosen to be 1 here , so there is no off - diagonal disorder .",
    "for each disorder strength @xmath66 in a particular alloy , the upper panels show the averaged bloch spectral function at five * k*-points along the high symmetry direction @xmath108k .",
    "the corresponding dirac dispersions are shown in the lower set of panels along @xmath97 line .",
    "the first thing to note is that the spectral function modifies quickly from sharp near @xmath109-functions to lorentzian shapes with increasing disorder strength @xmath86 as well as increasing alloy concentration @xmath110 .",
    "in addition , the function gets more and more asymmetric with increasing @xmath86 .",
    "such asymmetries can be described as a tendency of more scattering to occur near the resonance energies around @xmath85 .",
    "in other words , line shapes around @xmath85 tend to have a weak second peak or wide tail over the resonance region . for the present diagonal disordered case ,",
    "the dirac point is simply shifted by an average energy @xmath111    the corresponding total dos for the same set of disorder strengths ( @xmath66 ) and the alloy concentrations ( @xmath112 ) are shown in fig .",
    "the individual projected dos on the two sublattices @xmath29 and @xmath32 in this case are same , because we have maintained uniform diagonal disorder on both the sublattices .",
    "however , the present theory is equally capable of treating the two sublattices differently with a different nature of disorder on them . in that case",
    ", the two inequivalent sublattices will have different projected quantities .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , one can notice an exactly similar shift of the dirac point ( to the average @xmath113 ) in the dos as shown in the dispersion .",
    "the disorder effects are pronounced around the dirac - point energy @xmath113 and get milder around the hump below @xmath114 . above this disorder strength ,",
    "the left band edge starts to show up extra features with a dip at around @xmath115 , ( as shown in the bottom panel for all the three alloy concentration ) .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to the cpa works done earlier@xcite but differ in quantitative details .",
    "we now turn to the cases with off - diagonal disorder .",
    "such problems can not be dealt with within the cpa . also , direct calculation of the averaged spectral functions and disorder induced lifetimes is also not feasible with other techniques and the strength of the asr comes to the fore .",
    "in addition we should note that in our model , diagonal and off - diagonal disorders are correlated : e.g. if the atom a occupies the site @xmath116 with probability @xmath117 and atom b occupies the site @xmath118 with probability @xmath110 , then @xmath119 _ has to be _",
    "@xmath120 with probability 1 .",
    "although the present theory is equally capable of investigating other interesting cases ( e.g. inhomogeneous disorder , pseudo - binary type disorder etc . ) , here we have chosen to explore three cases which should reflect the behavior of a variety of the realistic materials .",
    "the three cases are :    * strong diagonal and weak off - diagonal disorder ; with parameters @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 . * weak diagonal and strong off - diagonal disorder ; with parameters @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 . * strong diagonal as well as strong off - diagonal disorder ; with parameters @xmath127 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .    the results for these three cases are shown in the top , middle and bottom panels of fig . [ fig7 ] respectively , for the same three alloys a@xmath128b@xmath99 as before .",
    "other details are same as in fig .",
    "notice that unlike the diagonal disordered case , effects of both diagonal and off - diagonal disorder are much more dramatic . in addition to highly asymmetric nature , the bloch spectral function is found to have a double peaked structure in the extreme case of strong diagonal and off - diagonal disorder ( shown in the bottom panels ) .",
    "such doubly peaked line shape introduces extra discontinuous bands in the dispersion curve .",
    "such a structure had been seen before in phonon problems@xcite which also have intrinsic off - diagonal disorder in the dynamical matrices .",
    "there it arose because of resonant modes . here",
    "too we shall give a similar explanation .",
    "these dispersion at resonance have relatively large fwhm s and it will be interesting to choose a realistic material of similar disorder properties and investigate the experimental outcome .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the sublattice projected dos for the same three limiting cases for the three alloys as above .",
    "the solid blue and the dashed red lines indicate the projected dos on the sublattices @xmath29 and @xmath32 respectively . because of the random hopping ( off - diagonal ) interaction in this case , the two sublattices acquire different environment around it , and hence possess different projected quantities on them .",
    "as expected , the dos in these cases have large smearing . the effective environment around the two sublattices",
    "is maximally different from each other in the extreme case of both strong diagonal+off - diagonal disorders ( as shown in the bottom panels ) , as evident from the large difference between their projected dos .",
    "interestingly , for this particular case , the consequence of the discontinuous bands in the -ve energy range ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) shows up via a dip in the dos along with a much larger smearing .",
    "apart from this extreme case , the dirac point for all the other cases has moved in exact accordance with that of the band shift as in fig .",
    "the topology of the dos on the two sides of the dirac point are very different from each other specially in the case of strong diagonal and off - diagonal disorder ( bottom panels ) . in totality , the effects of off - diagonal disorder is very different from that of diagonal disorder ( as a comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig8 ] will show ) .",
    "treatments of off - diagonal disorder is straight - forward and accurate in the asr formalism .",
    "we present a theoretical model to study the effects of diagonal and off - diagonal disorder in graphene on an equal footing . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first theoretical framework to reliably take into account the effects of off - diagonal disorder in describing the spectral properties of graphene .",
    "we show how the topology of the dirac dispersion , and the location of dirac point change with the strength of disorder and impurity concentration .",
    "interestingly , the dispersion in case of strong diagonal and off - diagonal disorder tends to have an extra discontinuous band which is rather uncommon in the graphene fermiology with simple disorder . as such we propose to verify such effects in the electronic dispersion by setting up an experiment on a similar realistic graphene system , where both the diagonal and the off - diagonal disorder are strong .",
    "we believe that such a study may provide a deeper insight into the physics and materials perspective of graphene . finally , we want to state that our formulation is quite general and can be applied to the case of other 2d materials , e.g. , bn in presence of disorder .    _",
