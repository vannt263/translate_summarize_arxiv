    "four large volume time projection chambers ( vtpc1 and vtpc2 inside the magnetic fields , mtpcl and mtpcr downstream of the magnets ) provide for charged particle tracking and identification .",
    "a smaller time projection chamber ( gtpc ) placed between the two magnets together with two multiwire proportional chambers ( vpc1 and vpc2 ) in forward direction allows tracking in the high momentum region through the gaps between the principal track detectors .",
    "a ring calorimeter ( rcal ) closes the detector setup 18  m downstream of the target .    as details of the beam and target setup ,",
    "the trigger definition as well as the event and track selection have been given in @xcite only those parts of the detector which are of special interest for the present paper will be described here .",
    "this concerns in particular the extension of the acceptance into the large @xmath25 region and the neutron calorimetry .",
    "[ sec : high_mom ]    the particles originating from the primary interaction vertex and missing , at high momentum , the main tpc arrangement , are detected in the gtpc and vpc s .",
    "these three sets of points are sufficiently far from each other to provide a reasonable lever arm for momentum measurement .",
    "a sketch of this detector part is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gtpc_vpc ] . for experimental details see @xcite .",
    "the vpc proportional chambers feature a single sense wire plane with strip readout ( @xmath2830 degree inclination ) on both cathode surfaces resulting in a space resolution of 2  mm .",
    "this results , together with the gtpc resolution of less than 150  @xmath29 m , in a longitudinal momentum resolution of    @xmath30    where the error is dominated by the vpc position resolution .",
    "the momentum resolution at maximum momentum was controlled using a trigger on beam particles . for inelastic events ,",
    "it is also established by the width of the diffractive peak as shown in the raw @xmath31 distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : rawpz ] .",
    "the general improvement of charged particle acceptance at @xmath32  0.4 due to this detector combination , as compared to the tracks visible in the main tpc detector only , is also apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : rawpz ] .",
    "the corresponding transverse momentum resolution is given by    @xmath33    it is dominated by both the gtpc and the transverse vertex resolutions . the resulting uncertainty of 30  mev / c at beam momentum is small enough to allow the extraction of transverse momentum distributions up to the kinematic limit .",
    "[ sec : neut_det ]    forward neutrons as well as fast forward charged particles are detected in the ring calorimeter ( rcal ) .",
    "this device , originally designed for the study of jet production in deep inelastic interactions by the cern na5 experiment @xcite , is placed 18  m downstream of the target .",
    "it is a cylindrical structure with azimuthal and radial subdivision into 240 cells , each with an electromagnetic and hadronic compartment .    for the present purpose , it was off - centered with respect to the beam axis such that a fully sensitive fiducial area of 80@xmath34160 @xmath35 corresponding to the size of the vpc chambers could be established , see fig .",
    "[ fig : exp ] .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath0 cut - off of 1.25  gev / c at @xmath25  =  0.2 , increasing to more than 2  gev / c at @xmath32  0.4 , for neutral particles .",
    "each rcal cell is built up from 2 parts : an electromagnetic part ( 20 radiation lengths of pb / scintillator sandwich ) and a hadronic part ( 4 interaction lengths of fe / scintillator sandwich ) @xcite .",
    "energy deposits in the two parts are recorded separately . as the position resolution of the rcal",
    "is rather limited in the transverse plane due to the substantial cell size , only @xmath0 integrated @xmath25 distributions are presented in this paper . for experimental details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "[ sec : veto ]    the vpc detectors are essential for the discrimination between charged and neutral hadrons impinging on the rcal .",
    "the geometrical situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcal_neut ] , where the vpc acceptance is superposed to the @xmath36 structure of the calorimeter .",
    "as the efficiency of the vpc detectors for charged particles has been measured to be higher than 99% , the presence of a calorimeter cluster together with the absence of a corresponding hit in the vpc surface yields a clean selection of neutral particles . in the case of multiple - hit patterns",
    "the equality of the signal amplitudes induced on the cathode surface by a traversing particle was used for pattern recognition by matching equal - amplitude strip combinations .",
    "two reliable tests of the vpc - rcal performance using external constraints were developed .",
    "the first one uses the fact that the vast majority of fast forward tracks is of positive charge . in case of vpc inefficiency",
    "this would lead , due to the bending of charged tracks in the magnetic field , to a noticeable left - right asymmetry of neutron detection .",
    "the second test uses the gtpc information as additional constraint on charged trajectories . in both cases a reliable assessment of the systematic errors is obtained .",
    "[ sec : calo ]    the rcal calibration was performed with beam particles of 40 and 158  gev / c momentum .",
    "the resulting hadronic energy resolution can be parametrized by the following expression :    @xmath37    this is well compatible with earlier detailed studies @xcite .",
    "the constant term in addition to the square - root behaviour is mainly due to the non - uniformity of the response over the calorimeter surface .",
    "the energy response was found to be non - gaussian which was taken into account in the unfolding procedure .",
    "using beams of identified electrons and pions , a precise separation of the rcal response to hadronic and electromagnetic particles has been obtained .",
    "this separation is quantified by a cut in the electromagnetic fraction of the cluster - energy which was placed at 0.6 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : encut ] .    with this cut ,",
    "the contamination from electromagnetic particles ( mainly photons from @xmath38 decay ) is negligible at all energies .",
    "the loss of hadrons due to the cut has been determined using identified beam particles at different momenta and also by matching identified tracks in the tpc system and the corresponding calorimeter clusters in the region of common acceptance .",
    "it can be parametrized as :    @xmath39    the analysis of the calorimeter response required the development of an optimized cluster finding algorithm which fully exploits the analog response of the rcal cells .",
    "as the magnetic field suppresses low energy hadrons on the rcal fiducial surface , in most cases only single high energy protons or neutrons which may be accompanied by lower - energy k@xmath40 or anti - neutrons , have to be accounted for .",
    "the cluster - finding algorithm thus first tries to find the largest cluster and verifies its shape - compatibility with the cluster model as obtained from calibration data .",
    "if needed , clusters are split further .",
    "monte carlo methods were used to estimate the effects of cluster overlap , demonstrating that this causes only small and well controllable systematic errors on the 2% level .",
    "[ sec : unfold ]    a critical step in the analysis of the neutron data is the unfolding of the calorimeter resolution from the measured momentum distribution . with a starting estimate of the real neutron distribution as an input",
    ", a monte carlo simulation is used to predict the distribution modified by the calorimeter resolution .",
    "the difference between the real measurement and the monte carlo output is fed back to correct the input estimation . in a few steps , this iterative process results in a precise description of the raw neutral particle energy distribution . due to the approximately linear behaviour of the measured spectrum as a function of @xmath25 ,",
    "the raw and the unfolded distributions are consistent with each other over most of the @xmath25 range with the exception of the regions around @xmath25  =  1 and @xmath25  =  0.1 .",
    "as the real neutron distribution is constrained to the physical region @xmath41  1 , the unphysical tail beyond the kinematic limit is removed .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : neut_raw ] .",
    "indeed the unfolded spectrum is consistent with zero at @xmath25 beyond 1 and the corrected distribution is increased over the measured one above @xmath42  0.7 in accordance with the width of the rcal energy resolution .",
    "[ sec : neut_xf ]    in the absence of resolution in transverse momentum the transformation from the neutron energy as measured in the sps lab system to the cms variable @xmath25 introduces a spread in @xmath25 which depends on the range in @xmath0 and on the energy .",
    "this spread diverges with decreasing energy assuming a fixed @xmath0 window .",
    "taking however account of the transverse momentum cut - off at low energy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cov]i , and limiting the @xmath0 range to 2  gev / c in the high energy region , this divergence is regularized such that the actual spread in @xmath25 varies between 0.012 and 0.024 with the maximum value at @xmath25  =  0.5 .",
    "this spread is small compared to the bin width of 0.1 in @xmath25 .",
    "the actual transformation was performed using monte carlo methods under the assumption that the @xmath0 distribution of the neutrons would be equal to the one for protons . as shown in the later sects .",
    "[ sec : neut ] and [ sec : hera ] of this paper this assumption has been verified experimentally .",
    "the resulting systematic errors are negligible .    the same assumption concerning the neutron @xmath0 distribution has been made concerning the correction for the @xmath0 cut - off at low @xmath25 .",
    "here the correction decreases rapidly from 20% at @xmath25  =  0.1 to less than 1% at @xmath25  =  0.3 .",
    "allowing for a 10% variation in surface of the assumed neutron @xmath0 distribution beyond the experimental cut - off , this leads to the systematic error estimate of less than 2% given in table  [ tab : syst ] .",
    "[ sec : bin_scheme ]    the na49 detector acceptance allows for the extraction of baryon yields over most of the forward cms hemisphere , with a welcome extension to negative @xmath25 which may be used for a test of the experimental forward - backward symmetry .",
    "the available event statistics limits the transverse momentum range to @xmath43  1.9  gev / c for protons and @xmath43  1.7  gev / c for anti- protons .",
    "the strong decrease of the anti - proton yield with increasing @xmath25 defines a further limit at @xmath41  0.4 . for protons",
    "there is an acceptance gap at @xmath32  0.6 and @xmath43  0.4  gev / c .",
    "this is a result of the interaction trigger : a small scintillation counter , s4 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : exp ] ) , vetoes non - interacting beam particles and , unavoidably , also events with charged secondaries in this region .    as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : na49 ] the granularity of the hadron calorimeter used for neutron detection does not allow for binning in transverse momentum .",
    "in addition the size of the fiducial region in the transverse plane progressively cuts off @xmath0 values at below 2  gev / c with decreasing @xmath25 .",
    "this effect , together with the uncertainties of estimating the inseparable anti - neutron and k@xmath40 yields at low @xmath25 , leads to a cutoff at @xmath25  =  0.05 for neutrons .",
    "the accessible kinematical regions for baryons described above were subdivided into bins in the @xmath25/@xmath0 plane which vary according to the available particle yields .",
    "effects of finite bin width are corrected for in the enumeration of the inclusive cross sections , see sect .",

    "[ sec : pid ]    as compared to the preceding publication of pion production @xcite the identification of charged particles using energy loss measurement in the tpc detector system has been further improved .",
    "in fact the extraction of pion yields by a four - parameter fit to the truncated @xmath44 distribution of a track sample in a given bin , see @xcite , is insensitive to small imperfections of the analog response of the detectors .",
    "in addition it has been shown that the method used does not introduce additional fluctuations over and above the purely statistical error of the extracted pion sample .",
    "this is not quite the case for the other particle species , especially for kaons and anti - protons which have generally small yields in relation to pions . here",
    "the fit procedure introduces non - negligible additional fluctuations which are to be described by an error matrix with terms that create effective errors beyond the ones related to the particle yields proper . in this context",
    "it is mandatory to reduce the possible variation of the absolute position of the energy loss for the different particle species to a minimum in order to constrain the possible variations of the fit parameters .",
    "[ sec : truncated ]    the distribution of truncated means as a function of @xmath47 shows non - linear deviations from the bethe - bloch parametrization which is formulated for the total ionization energy loss .",

    "for the two gas mixtures used in the na49 experiment ( ne+co@xmath48 91/9 and ar+ch@xmath49+co@xmath48 90/5/5 ) it has also been extracted experimentally by a careful re - analysis of all data .",

    "[ sec : shifts ]    a thorough re - analysis of the particle identification methods compared to the earlier work on pion extraction @xcite has been performed .",
    "this concerns a re - calibration of time dependences , detector edge effects and the various corrections due to track length variations at the pad plane including the influence of @xmath50 effects in the inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",

    "[ sec : error ]    particle identification proceeds , in each chosen bin of phase space , via a @xmath51 optimization procedure between the measured truncated energy loss distribution and the sum of four single particle @xmath44 distributions of known shape but a priori unknown positions and widths for electrons , pions , kaons and protons , respectively . due to the small fraction of electrons and their position on the density plateau of the energy loss function , and due to the known dependence of the @xmath44 resolution on the @xmath44 value of each",
    "particle species @xcite , the problem reduces in practice to the determination of eight quantities : three positions , one width parameter and four yield parameters which correspond to the predicted number of particles .",
    "the statistical error of the four particle yields thus obtained may be determined from the dependence of @xmath51 on all parameters ( covariance matrix ) .",
    "it is to be noted that the inverse square root of the predicted numbers for each particle species is only a first approximation to the relative statistical error of the yields .",
    "the fluctuations of the fitted particle positions , fig .",
    "[ fig : shifts ] , and their contributions to the error of the yield parameters are intercorrelated with the particle ratios and with the relative distances of the energy deposits in the @xmath44 variable .",
    "the proper evaluation of the covariance matrix thus gives the effective statistical fluctuation of the yield parameters to be quoted as the experimental statistical error .",
    "the method may be cross - checked using monte carlo methods by creating , in a given bin , statistically independent samples using the yield parameters fitted to the experimental @xmath44 distribution as input and allowing for their proper statistical fluctuation .",
    "thus the assumption of a gaussian parameter distribution used in the covariance matrix approach has been justified in particular also for phase space bins of small statistics or strongly correlated fit parameters .",
    "it is interesting to compare the predicted relative statistical error of the yield parameters to the inverse square root of the fitted particle numbers . in case of `` perfect '' identification",

    "the question of the scaling of baryon yields versus cross sections has been addressed in the context of the rapid increase of the total inelastic cross sections with interaction energy .",
    "scaling of yields rather than cross sections is necessary in order not to violate baryon number conservation . *",
    "the comparison to deep inelastic lepton scattering establishes hadronic factorization also in this reaction within the experimental uncertainties and the phase space region available .",
    "finally it should be stated that the establishment of a precise base of single inclusive data on baryon production is only a first step in an effort to shed some light on the general problem of baryon number transfer .",
    "the transition from the incoming baryonic target or projectile to the observed final state is , as a part of the non - perturbative sector of qcd , not understood on the level of any reliable theory . in hadronic interactions ,",
    "most approaches are using ad - hoc assumptions like for instance the concept of di - quark fragmentation . in electroproduction baryon production",
    "is described in most approaches by the scattering of the virtual photon off an exchange pion .",
    "there is no doubt that this situation can only be clarified by further and more detailed experimental studies which go beyond the single inclusive level .",

    "this widely neglected field will provide very strong constraints concerning the repartition of particle species as products of the cascading decay of heavy resonances , especially concerning the relation between neutrons and protons as it is given by the isospin structure of the initial state .",

    "hemisphere the forward - backward correlation of baryon number transfer may be studied , in particular the feed - over of baryon number from one hemisphere to the other and its evolution with interaction energy .",
    "the use of neutron projectiles and of non - baryonic , mesonic beams as they are available in fixed - target operation opens the possibility of model - independent studies essentially relying on baryon number conservation and concepts like isospin symmetry .    in this context",
    "the study of nuclear reactions , in particular of proton - nucleus and pion - nucleus scattering with controlled centrality , provides unique access to multiple hadronic interactions .",
    "the strong dependence of the final state baryon distributions on the number of projectile subcollisions inside the nucleus , generally misnamed as `` stopping '' and as yet not understood on any theoretical level , offers a further and very strong constraint on the possible mechanism of baryon number transfer .",
