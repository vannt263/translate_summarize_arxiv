    "our work suggests that in the case of hmxbs , both the @xmath0 formalism and the @xmath1 algorithm are possible to reproduce the observed xlf . in the framework of @xmath0 formalism ,",
    "a high value of @xmath0 is needed , although a constant value is not required .",
    "we also show the distinct observational properties , such as the period distribution of hmxbs , that may serve as possible keys to understanding the ce evolution and to discriminate between different ce models .",
    "we have used an eps code to model the xlf of hmxbs with a range of theoretical models describing the ce phase .",
    "our study shows that the observed xlf can be reproduced quite closely under both ce mechanisms .",
    "provided that the same parameter combination is chosen , the @xmath1 algorithm seems to produce more hmxbs than the @xmath0 formalism , by a factor of up to @xmath106 .",
    "additionally , in the framework of the @xmath0 formalism , a high value of @xmath0 around @xmath107 better fits the observed xlf .",
    "we present the detailed properties of hmxb populations under the @xmath1 algorithm , and find that the simulated hmxbs have a much larger population of short period ( less than about several tens of days ) bh - he systems than in the @xmath0 formalism , which may serve as clues to discriminate between the two kinds of models .",
    "our work motivates further high - resolution x - ray and optical observations of hmxb populations in nearby star - forming galaxies .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions that enabled us to improve the manuscript .",
