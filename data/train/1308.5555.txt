    "soft matter physics deals with systems as different as colloids , polymers , gels , glasses , liquid crystals and others , where one common feature is their self - organization into very rich mesoscopic phases.@xcite to model this behavior , one often uses a pairwise inter - particle interaction possessing several length scales and/or mixture of attraction and repulsion.@xcite such interaction potential , as a function of the particle density , indeed leads to the formation of clusters , particle chains , labyrinthal gel - like structures and ( almost ) regular lattices .",
    "this in turn questions the known analogy between charged colloids and vortices in superconductors , since the latter typically repel and form a triangular ( abrikosov ) lattice . on the other hand ,",

    "[ fig1 ] ) , in attempt to reveal unique vortex phases .",
    "in addition to the crystalline vortex lattice , one now envisages vortex flocculation , gelation and glassy phases , some similar to vortex matter encountered in high - temperature,@xcite multiband,@xcite and other unconventional superconducting@xcite and superfluid systems.@xcite the film geometry is chosen for an easy realization in experiment , but also in order to have asymptotic long - range @xmath0 repulsion between vortices@xcite - similar to the electrostatic coulomb interaction in charged colloids .",
    "we will show that the complexity of the obtained patterns stems from the changes in the short- and mid - range interaction between vortices , whose relative strength depends on the parameters of the layers , especially their coherence length @xmath1 and penetration depth @xmath2 , but also their thicknesses , electronic coupling between them , and chosen temperature with respect to their individual critical temperatures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the theoretical formalism .",
    "section iii summons and classifies the observed magnetic flux patterns , which are further characterized using radial distribution function in section iv .",
    "further we discuss the influence of temperature in section v , where we also show the behavior of the heat capacity and its changes affiliated with different flux phases .",
    "our results are summarized in section vi .",
    "most of earlier works on vortex structures and their dynamics employed molecular dynamics with pairwise vortex interactions .",
    "this is truly valid only for vortices in extreme type - ii superconductors , where vortex cores are point - like small .",
    "however , overlapping vortex cores do not interact pairwise , and the interaction potentials are highly non - trivial.@xcite this turns out to be even more complex for our bilayer system , where vortices are extended objects with different size of the core in two layers .",
    "we therefore opt for full numerical simulation within the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory , supplemented by the lawrence - doniach ( ld ) coupling between the layers.@xcite the appropriate free energy functional then consists of the individual contributions from each layer , the ld coupling term , and the energy of the magnetic field in and around the sample :    @xmath3 ds + s \\int \\eta|p\\psi_2 -\\psi_1|^2 ds + \\int \\frac{(\\mathbf h-\\mathbf h)^2}{8\\pi } dv.\\ ] ]    here cooper - pair condensates in the two layers are indexed by @xmath4 and described by the order parameters @xmath5 , assumed to be uniform over the layer thickness @xmath6 . *",
    "h * is the applied magnetic field and @xmath7 is the field including the magnetic response of the layers .",
    "the coefficients @xmath8 are temperature dependent ( where @xmath9 are the critical temperatures of the individual layers ) and connected with the nominal coherence lengths of the layers @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes cooper - pair masses in the layers .",
    "the ld coupling coefficient is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the effective cooper pair mass for tunneling between the layers and @xmath14 is the vertical distance between the layers ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the phase factor @xmath15 ensures the gauge invariance .    in what follows , we work in the london gauge @xmath16 ,",
    "therefore the maxwell equation is just @xmath17 further we make approximation @xmath18 , so that the phase factor @xmath19 in the ld coupling term is unity ( similar model was also employed in ref .  ) . since @xmath20 , eq .",

    "the current between the layers @xmath25 can be neglected if it is much smaller than the currents within the superconducting layers @xmath26 which leads to the condition @xmath27 if we assume that the amplitudes of the wave functions in two layers are not too different from each other .",
    "assuming @xmath20 is thus well justified for @xmath28 or very distant layers @xmath29 i.e. in the case of very weakly coupled layers , but also in the opposite case @xmath30 where the phases of the two order parameters are almost the same , so that the term @xmath31 vanishes .",
    "therefore , for the parameters of the sample chosen in the present work @xmath25 is always much smaller than the current within the superconducting layers and one can safely neglect it .",
    "the variational minimization of the functional ( with @xmath23 ) with respect to @xmath32 leads to the glld equations    @xmath33    @xmath34    [ ldequations_dim ]    where @xmath35 .",

    "the lowest considered temperature was 1k , which was necessary to be deep in the superconducting state of the type - i layer .",
    "zero temperature coherence length of the type - ii layer ( @xmath45 ) was then taken as unit of distance in all calculations , while @xmath46 was swept between 2 and 10 @xmath45 .",
    "since this variation had only minor qualitative influence on the observed vortex structures , we fixed the parameter @xmath47 to 0.2 , for computational convenience .",

    "the formation of domains in type - i layer as a trapping potential for vortices is interesting because of their sensitivity to applied in - plane magnetic field,@xcite or current.@xcite therefore one can easily manipulate externally the domain structure in the type - i layer ( e.g. straighten / relax the domains ) , and thereby dynamically change and restore the vortex patterns in the type - ii layer , similarly to the controllability achieved in the superconductor - ferromagnet bilayers.@xcite",
    "in this section we present the radial distribution functions @xmath75 of different vortex phases observed in the superconducting type - i / type - ii bilayer , which can in some cases serve to distinguish particular vortex configurations in e.g. sans measurements .",

    "for example in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] in panels ( e ) and ( f ) for 96 , respectively 112 vortices one can see that the second peak splits into two , which is a well - known effect due to the formation of the regular triangular ( abrikosov ) lattice ( in the first case with holes of the meissner state still present ) .     for @xmath85 .",

    "one can also see in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] that the chain phase for @xmath86 and intermediate densities ( 48 and 64 vortices ) can be distinguished by having the second peak of @xmath75 higher than the first one .",
    "similar signature was also observed in ref .  , but there it was found for the structure factor @xmath87 i.e. in the @xmath88-space .",

    "another degree of controllability of the flux patterns in our system is provided by temperature , due to the different critical temperatures @xmath9 of the layers . for the considered parameters ,",
    "elevated temperature will swiftly deplete superconductivity in the type - i layer , and will also interconnect the flux patterns in that layer due to the increasing coherence length . both these features will influence the observed vortex configurations in the type - ii layer .",
    "hence , one is able to control and monitor the phase transitions of soft vortex matter in our bilayer system simply by changing temperature .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , where we start from a rather disordered gel - like state from fig .",

    "we found that for these parameters the stable phase at low temperature are small vortex clusters .",
    "these for intermediate temperatures coalesce into a single stripe which at higher temperature spreads over entire simulation region and interconnects with adjacent stripes into abrikosov lattice .",

    "<S> magnetic flux patterns are known to strongly differ in the intermediate state of type - i and type - ii superconductors . using a type - i / type - ii bilayer we demonstrate hybridization of these flux phases into a plethora of unique new ones . owing to a complicated multi - body interaction between individual fluxoids , many different intriguing patterns are possible under applied magnetic field , such as few - vortex clusters , vortex chains , mazes or labyrinthal structures resembling the phenomena readily encountered in soft matter physics . however , in our system the patterns are tunable by sample parameters , magnetic field , current and temperature , which reveals transitions from short - range clustering to long - range ordered phases such as parallel chains , gels , glasses and crystalline vortex lattices , or phases where lamellar type - i flux domains in one layer serve as a bedding potential for type - ii vortices in the other - configurations clearly beyond the soft - matter analogy . </S>"
