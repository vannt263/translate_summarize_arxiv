    "solar prominences are over dense and cool material in the tenuous , hot corona .",
    "proposed mechanisms for prominence formation include : ( 1 ) _ chromospheric transport _ by siphon flows @xcite , magnetic reconnection @xcite , or magnetic flux emergence @xcite , and ( 2 ) _ coronal condensation _ due to a diversity of radiatively - driven thermal instabilities @xcite occurring in current sheets and coronal loops . prominence formation by condensation was once questioned because a quiet , static corona is an inadequate mass source .",
    "this does not apply to the solar corona that is known to be dynamic with mass being continually replenished , say , by footpoint heating driving chromospheric evaporation @xcite , by ubiquitous spicules @xcite , or by thermal convection involving emerging magnetic bubbles @xcite .",
    "condensation was seen in the so - called  cloud prominences \" @xcite or  coronal spiders \" @xcite with material streaming out along curved trajectories .",
    "it was also observed in cooling loops @xcite and proposed to produce coronal rain .",
    "however , quantitative analysis of prominence condensation has been hampered by the high off - limb scattered light of ground - based instruments and limited spatial / temporal resolution or field of view ( fov ) of previous space instruments .",
    "this situation has changed with the launches of the and _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( ) .",
    "s atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; * ? ?",
    "* ) offers unprecedented capabilities with a full sun fov at 12  s cadence and @xmath6 resolution . here",
    "we present a first aia observation of prominence formation , involving magnetic dips and plasma condensing there to build up the prominence mass and balance sustained drainage .",
    "observations of this kind may provide answers to three long - standing questions :    1 .",
    "how do condensation and drainage control the mass budget of a prominence ?",
    "2 .   what are the favorable plasma and magnetic field conditions at the micro and macroscopic scales of a prominence ?",
    "3 .   what is the relationship between prominences and other solar activities , such as cmes and flares ?",
    "on 2010/11/25 at about 21:10  ut , a confined eruption is observed by /aia and a in noaa active region ( ar )  11126 ( figures  [ overview.eps](a)(c ) ; animations  1(a ) and 1(b ) ) .",
    "most of the pre - existing prominence material is swept away along transequatorial loops at @xmath7@xmath8 and some lands on the other hemisphere .    at 2010/11/26 05:00  ut",
    ", the first sign of new , cool 304    material is observed at the dips in the active region loops and consequently slides downward along underlying loops as coronal rain ( figure  [ overview.eps](f ) ; animations  1(c ) ) .",
    "two hours later , a nearby condensation at greater rates leads to the formation of a new prominence ( figures  [ overview.eps](f ) and ( g ) ) .",
    "after another day , the prominence gradually shrinks and eventually disappears behind the limb . in this letter , we focus on the condensation and mass drainage in the new prominence , leaving other interesting aspects of this event for future investigation .",
    "let us first examine the magnetic environment .",
    "prior to the eruption , there are transequatorial loops of various lengths , best seen at 171    in figure  [ promin-dip.eps](a ) and animation 1(a ) .",
    "the limb location of the event does not allow accurate determination of the magnetic configuration , but potential field extrapolationssynop ] up to a week earlier indicate the persistence of such loops that connect the positive trailing polarity of ar  11126 in the south and the diffuse negative polarity in the north .",
    "after the eruption , these loops fade and gradually reappear . since 11/26 05:00  ut",
    ", one can can identify an apparent depression , likely formed in projection by shallow dips of numerous loops ( figure  [ promin-dip.eps ] , left ) , where the initial condensation occurs shortly at 07:00  ut . the cool 304    material forms a  v \"- shape ( figure  [ promin-dip.eps ] , right ) , whose lower tip progressively drops and eventually drains down in a nearly vertical direction , suggesting magnetic reconnection ( as sketched here ) or cross - field slippage ( low et al .  2012b , in preparation ) .",
    "to track the cooling process and infer the origin of the prominence mass , we placed a @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) wide cut l0 along the transequatorial loops to the north of the dips and two vertical cuts of @xmath11 wide and @xmath12 tall from the limb across these loops at the lowest dip ( v0 ) and further north ( v1 ; figure  [ promin-dip.eps](d ) ; cuts to the south of the dips yielded similar results ) . by averaging image pixels across each cut , we obtained space - time diagrams as shown in figure  [ cooling.eps ] together with selected temporal profiles .",
    "we find a general trend of successive brightening after the eruption at 193 , 171 , and then 304   , each delayed by 25 hours .",
    "this indicates gradual cooling across the characteristic temperatures at the response peaks of these broadband channels , from @xmath13 to @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite . at 193   ,",
    "the initial brightening likely results from mass being replenished after the eruption and/or cooling from even higher temperatures ; the later darkening at 9:00  ut and heights @xmath16@xmath17 is primarily due to absorption by the cool prominence material .",
    "condensation of the 304    material occurs only at low altitudes ( @xmath18@xmath19 ) near the dips , while cooling from higher temperatures takes place almost throughout the entire transequatorial loop system involving a vast volume ( figure  [ cooling.eps ] , left ) .",
    "this implies that these loops likely feed mass to the prominence forming at their dips that , partly because of the stretched and possibly sheared magnetic field lines ( say , near a polarity inversion line ) and thus reduced field - aligned thermal conduction , may facilitate further cooling and condensation ( low et al .  2012a , in preparation ) .",
    "we detected no systematic cooling flow in the loops though , possibly due to the insensitivity of aia ( passband imager ) to subtle flows without distinct mass blobs , except for occasional brief downflows and upflows of 304    material ( figures  [ cooling.eps](g ) ) .",
    "the 9  hr elapsed from the eruption to the initial condensation is on the same order of magnitude as the condensation timescales in thermal nonequilibrium simulations @xcite .",
    "condensation at 304    occurs first at a height of @xmath20 and progresses toward higher loops at @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , the projected speed of the solar rotation there ) , with a similar trend at 171    ( figures  [ cooling.eps](e ) and ( h ) ) .",
    "we speculate that those low - lying loops condense first because of their shorter lengths @xcite and/or their greater densities from gravitational stratification ( as radiative loss @xmath23@xmath24 ) .",
    "in this prominence , we find no sign of rising bubbles @xcite that can contribute to the prominence mass . if we further neglect other possible mass sources , the interplay between the mass condensation rate @xmath25 and downflow rate @xmath26 would determine the prominence mass change rate _",
    "prom = _ cond - _ drain .",
    "[ mass.conserve.eq ] the condensation rate @xmath25 , which can not be measured directly , can thus be inferred by measuring @xmath27 and @xmath26 independently , as described below in three steps .",
    "this prominence consists of numerous nearly vertical threads of typically @xmath28 ( 1.43  mm ) thick ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the observed optically thick 304    emission originates from a layer known as the prominence - coronal transition region ( pctr ) surrounding a denser , cooler emitting core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , later seen in mauna loa data ( not shown ) .",
    "however , lacking sufficient coverage of the event , we chose to use a typical pctr electron density @xmath29 @xcite and thus @xmath30 as a lower limit for the entire prominence .",
    "we also conservatively assumed that the observed threads do not overlap each other .",
    "we selected a sector - shaped area to enclose the bulk of the prominence ( see figure  [ downflow-promin.eps](c ) ) .",
    "the sector covers a height range of @xmath31@xmath32 above the limb and a latitude range of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 wide on its bottom edge ) .",
    "we then integrated the area @xmath35 occupied by the prominence material inside the sector for all pixels above a threshold selected at @xmath36 above background .",
    "we obtained a lower limit to the prominence mass m_prom= a_prom d_thrd , [ mass-history.eq ] as shown in figure  [ mass-rates.eps](a ) .",
    "after the initial condensation , the prominence mass continues to increase and reaches the maximum at 16:01  ut , @xmath37 which is on the same order of magnitude as that determined from coronal absorption for a prominence of similar size @xcite .",
    "taking time derivative gives the mass change rate @xmath27 shown in figure  [ mass-rates.eps](c ) , which has a mean of @xmath38 and a maximum at 11:37  ut , @xmath39      to estimate the drainage rate of mass that leaves the sector - shaped area , we need to obtain the downflow velocity @xmath41 at position @xmath42 on the bottom edge of the sector and at time @xmath43 , and then spatially integrate the mass flux crossing this edge .",
    "here we assume that the warm pctr and cool core of the prominence thread have the same downflow velocity @xcite . to measure @xmath41 , we divided the sector into 24 vertical cuts of @xmath44 wide width of the vertical cuts was chosen to be as small as possible and yet wide enough to enclose most of the prominence threads that are close to but not exactly vertical . ]",
    "that start at @xmath11 above the limb to avoid spicules and discretize the bottom sector edge into distance bins @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , as shown in figure  [ downflow-promin.eps](c ) . for each cut",
    ", we obtained a space - time diagram for a 19  hr duration from 11/26 07:00 to 11/27  02:00  ut .",
    "as an example , the space - time diagram ( figures  [ downflow-promin.eps](d ) and ( e ) ) of cut # 12 located near the middle of the prominence shows numerous , episodic downward curved trajectories .",
    "each trajectory tracks the height of a blob of mass with time as it descends within the vertical cut .",
    "the descent covers a height range of several tens of arcseconds and lasts for a few minutes to half an hour .",
    "we fitted each well - defined trajectory with a parabolic function , as shown in figure  [ downflow-promin.eps](d ) , and determined the average acceleration @xmath47 and velocity @xmath48 at the reference height @xmath49 ( horizontal dashed line ) of the bottom edge of the sector .",
    "we exhaustively repeated such fits throughout the space - time diagram , only skipping an adjacent trajectory of a similar slope within any 10  minutes interval .",
    "the resulting fits are overlaid in figure  [ downflow-promin.eps](e ) , and the fitted velocities and accelerations are shown in figures  [ downflow-promin.eps](f ) and ( g ) . finally , we linearly interpolated the fitted velocities in time and obtained @xmath50 covering the full duration .",
    "we applied this procedure to all vertical cuts across the prominence and obtained a statistically significant sample of 874 parabolic downflow trajectories .",
    "as shown in figure  [ downflow-promin.eps](h ) , the fitted velocities have a narrow gaussian distribution , with a mean and median of @xmath51 , mode of @xmath52 , and standard deviation of @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , the accelerations ( figure  [ downflow-promin.eps](i ) ) have an exponential distribution @xmath54 , with a mean of @xmath55 , a standard deviation of @xmath56 @xmath57 , and a small mode of @xmath58 @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the solar surface gravitational constant .    after obtaining the downflow velocity @xmath61 at all cuts ,",
    "next we need the knowledge of the spatial width and temporal duration of each downflow stream . for the former , we assumed that within each @xmath44 wide cut , no more than one vertical thread ( typical width @xmath62 ) undergoes downflow at any moment , giving an effective filing factor of @xmath63 . for the latter , we defined a switch function @xmath64 that describes whether downflow occurs ( @xmath65 ) or not ( @xmath66 ) at the @xmath67th cut and time @xmath43 , depending on whether or not the emission intensity @xmath68 ( e.g. , figure  [ downflow-promin.eps](d ) ) in the corresponding space - time diagram at height @xmath69 is @xmath70 above the pre - event background",
    ". finally , summing over all vertical cuts ( as spatial integration ) yields the mass drainage rate : _",
    "drain(t ) = _",
    "i=0 ^ 23 a_thrd v(s_i , t ) z(s_i , t ) , [ mdot_drain.eq ] where @xmath71 is the cross - sectional area of the thread . as shown in figure  [ mass-rates.eps](c ) , it has a mean @xmath72 and a maximum @xmath73 at 11/26 14:08  ut . integrating @xmath40 over time yields the accumulative mass drained to date @xmath74 , as shown in figure  [ mass-rates.eps](b ) . at the end of the 19  hr duration",
    ", it reaches @xmath75 which is @xmath76 times the maximum prominence mass @xmath77 .",
    "the mass conservation equation  ( [ mass.conserve.eq ] ) then gives the condensation rate _",
    "cond = _ prom + _ drain , as shown in figure  [ mass-rates.eps](c ) .",
    "it closely follows the mass drainage rate @xmath40 , which dominates over the prominence mass change @xmath27 by about an order of magnitude .",
    "the condensation rate has a similar mean @xmath78 and maximum @xmath79 at 11/26 11:37  ut . the cumulative mass condensed in 19  hr is @xmath80 about the same as the mass drained to date .",
    "we find two episodes of rapid condensation and mass drainage , starting at 11/26 07:00 and 22:00  ut , which coincide with the variations of the prominence mass ( figure  [ mass-rates.eps](b ) ) .",
    "in fact , the drainage rate is positively correlated with the total prominence mass , with a linear correlation coefficient of @xmath81 ( figure  [ mass-rates.eps](d ) ) .",
    "we have presented new evidence of coronal condensation that leads to prominence formation at magnetic dips after a confined eruption . our major findings and their implications are as follows .    1 .",
    "the estimated average mass condensation rate in the prominence is @xmath82@xmath83 , giving an _ accumulative _ mass of @xmath0@xmath84 in 19  hr .",
    "most ( 96% ) of this mass , an order of magnitude more than the _ instantaneous _ total mass of the prominence , is drained as vertical threads . in other words ,",
    "a _ macroscopically quiescent _ prominence is a _ microscopically dynamic _",
    "object , with a total mass determined by the delicate balance between a significant mass supply and a drainage by downflows .",
    "this was suggested long ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but to the best of our knowledge , our observations provide the first quantitative evidence in terms of the prominence mass budget .",
    "2 .   the mass condensation and drainage rates are very close and _ linearly correlated _ with the total prominence mass .",
    "thus , the more material the prominence has , the more mass it is capable of draining . theoretical considerations of energy balance by low et al .",
    "( 2012b , in preparation ) indicates that the total mass is a critical parameter that determines how fast condensation takes place .",
    "the prominence downflows are much slower than free fall , with an average acceleration of @xmath85 , similar to that found by @xcite .",
    "this shows that gravity in the prominence is countered significantly , possibly by an upward lorentz force ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the horizontal component of the magnetic field , as indicated by polarimetric measurements @xcite , or by transverse wave generated pressure as originally suggested for braking coronal rain @xcite .",
    "4 .   after hours of cooling from @xmath0@xmath86 throughout almost the entire transequatorial loop system that confined the early eruption ,",
    "the initial prominence condensation ( @xmath0@xmath87 ) occurs at the loop dips and consequently progresses toward greater heights .",
    "this suggests that these large - scale loops may function like a funnel with a vast collecting volume that feeds mass to the prominence , and the dips likely provide favorable conditions for further cooling and condensation ( cf .",
    ". 5 .   the preceding eruption might be independent of the prominence reformation or have provided heated material to make the confining transequatorial loops overdense , favoring radiative cooling and possibly responsible for other post - eruption prominence formations @xcite .",
    "we propose that the passage of mass on the order of @xmath84/day , comparable to a cme mass , could be a general property of prominences exhibiting active drainage .",
    "if the  magneto - thermal convection \" suggested by @xcite in prominence - cavity structures also involves the drainage of such a large mass , its weight is energetically significant for holding a magnetic flux rope in the cavity until it erupts into a cme ."
