    "they are primarily produced through a compton scattering of quarks and gluons ( @xmath3 ) or an annihilation of quarks and anti - quarks ( @xmath4 ) as leading order processes , and the next leading order ( nlo ) process is dominated by bremsstrahlung ( fragment ) ( @xmath5 ) .",

    "there is a theoretical calculation that tried to explain the suppression at high @xmath6 by combining a structure function and an isospin effect  @xcite .",

    "therefore , we decided not to use p+p yield for now .",
    "the ratios are essentially consistent with the nlo pqcd expectation within the experimental and theoretical uncertainty for @xmath15gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the lower @xmath6 region may be due to initial multiple scattering of incoming partons or the jet - photon conversion effect .",
    "it is found that the p+p yield is underestimated by the nlo pqcd calculation at @xmath9=200gev  @xcite , and it may well happen at 62.4gev . as an attempt , we took the ratio of the p+p yield to the nlo pqcd calculation at 200gev , and shifted the horizontal scale by 0.312 ( = 62.4/200 ) , which is inspired by an idea of : @xmath31 the result is shown in the bottom right of fig .
