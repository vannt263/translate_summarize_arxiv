    "fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) liquids are remarkable many - electron systems that occur in two - dimensional electron gas with a perpendicular magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "this is the most studied and first experimentally realized system in condensed matter physics that has the topological order  @xcite .",
    "it is a typical strongly correlated electron system with a quenched kinetic energy in hamiltonian which fails the ability of the perturbation theory . on the other hand , comparing with the landau theory of the quantum phase transition , there is no order parameter , or symmetry breaking to describe the phase transition between any two fqh states .",
    "therefore , the understanding of the fqh effect has only benefited either from the numerical diagonalizing the hamiltonian for finite size system , such as exact diagonalization  @xcite , density matrix renormalization group  @xcite , matrix product state  @xcite , et.al . , or the using of model wavefunctions  @xcite . in the seminal paper of ref . ,",
    "moore and read found that these model wavefunctions can be expressed as correlators of the electron operators in a conformal field theory ( cft ) , i.e. , the so called conformal blocks . although the model wavefunctions are not the exact ground state wavefunctions for realistic hamiltonian , they are supposed to capture the universal properties of the fqh states such as fractional quasiparticle excitations and their fusion relations , statistics , as well as some exponents on the edge tunneling and quantum dimensions for quasiparticles .",
    "the most striking theoretically predicted properties of the fqh quasiparticles is the emergence of the abelian  @xcite or non - abelian braiding statistics  @xcite .",
    "the interchange of two abelian quasiparticles leads to a nontrivial phase on the wavefunction .",
    "they are named `` anyons '' since the phase is neither @xmath0 by fermions nor @xmath1 by bosons .",
    "the typical abelian fqh states which support the abelian quasiparticle excitation , such as the laughlin series at @xmath2 , have been observed and studied on detail . whereas the interchange of two non - abelian quasiparticles results in a unitary transformation of the ground state in the topological degenerating ground state hilbert space .",
    "based on this , the non - abelian fqh states have recently received much interest due to their potential application for topological protected fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite . thus far there are two most interesting examples as the candidates for the non - abelian ones which have been realized in experiments , namely the fqh states on the first landau level at filling factor @xmath3  @xcite and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 state is the only observed fqh state that has an even denominator in the filling factor .",
    "moore and read  @xcite proposed a candidate paired wavefunction which analogy to that in the @xmath5-wave superconductivity .",
    "the exact nature of the @xmath6 state is still undetermined .",
    "however , the most exciting candidate of the ground state is the @xmath7 parafermion state proposed by read and rezayi  @xcite .",
    "it describes a condensate of three - electron clusters which forms an incompressible state .    for fqh states",
    ", it has been established that there is a deep connection between the bipartited entanglement entropy  @xcite , or entanglement spectrum  @xcite and the topological properties embedded in the ground state and its low - lying excitations .",
    "this connection is based on the cft description of the bulk and edge of the fqh . for topological states in two dimension ,",
    "the bipartited entanglement entropy satisfies the `` area law '' with a universal order @xmath8 correction , namely the topological entanglement entropy  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath9 where the @xmath10 is the length of the boundary between two subsystems .",
    "the entanglement entropy depends on the way of the partition the system , or @xmath11 is not universal .",
    "for example , the bipartite fqh system can be implemented in both the momentum space and the real space of the two dimensional electron system .",
    "the former is called the orbital cut ( oc )  @xcite and the later real space cut ( rc )  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we mostly use the rc since it has a more accurate definition of the boundary in the `` area law '' .",
    "however , the topological entanglement entropy @xmath12 is a robust measurement of quantum entanglement in a topological phase .",
    "it has a connection to the total quantum dimension of the state as @xmath13 and @xmath14 . where @xmath15s are the quantum dimensions of each sectors making up the topological field theory of the corresponding fqh state . in fact , for a general read - rezayi state with order-@xmath16 clustering and at filling fraction @xmath17 , the total quantum dimension is @xmath18}$ ] . such as the laughlin state at @xmath19",
    ", the moore - read state at @xmath20 and the read - rezayi state at @xmath21 are corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23 rr states respectively .",
    "the topological entanglement entropy can have additional change while a topological excitation , or quasiparticle is contained in the subsystems , i.e. , @xmath24 while a quasiparticle with quantum dimension @xmath25 is added . in general ,",
    "abelian quasiparticle excitation has quantum dimension @xmath26 and @xmath27 for non - abelian quasiparticles .",
    "therefore , the behaviors of the entanglement entropy , especially the topological entanglement entropy are very different while a abelian or non - abelian quasiparticle is put in the subsystem , or in other words , we can detect the quantum dimension of the quasiparticle from the difference of the entanglement entropy before and after its excitation in the subsystem .    in this paper , we study the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum of the laughlin state , moore - read state and read - rezayi state and their quasiparticle excitation states on a finite cylinder .",
    "the wavefunctions are obtained by the method of jack polynomials  @xcite .",
    "it is one of the polynomial solutions for calogero - sutherland hamiltonian  @xcite which can describe the read - rezayi @xmath28-parafermion states with a negative parameter @xmath11 and a root configuration ( or partition ) .",
    "the advantage for studying fqh in cylinder geometry is that ( a ) there is no curvatures on the surface and the length @xmath29 is linearly with aspect to the system size ; ( b ) there are two edges at which the non - abelian quasiparticles can be produced from the root of the jacks .",

    "a cylinder is bipartited into two subsystems a and b in real - space . for abelian fqh state , a quasihole",

    "@xmath31 in @xmath32 direction in a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface , the single electron wave function in the lowest landau level is : @xmath33 in which @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the translational momentum along @xmath32 direction and the magnetic length is defined @xmath36 . for a finite size system",
    ", the number of basis states or orbits , @xmath37 , equals to the number of magnetic flux quantum penetrate from the surface .",
    "each orbit occupies an area @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the length in @xmath39 direction for a finite system is fixed with a given aspect ratio @xmath40 , namely @xmath41 .",
    "the entanglement entropy is defined as @xmath42 $ ] where @xmath43 is the reduced density matrix of the subsystem .",
    "if we make a cut in real space along @xmath32 direction , say at the position @xmath44 , the operators in momentum space can be wrote as a summation of two parts : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the operators in a / b subblock respectively .",
    "@xmath48/@xmath49 is the probability amplitude for an electron at the @xmath50th orbit to have its coordinates in block a / b .",
    "therefore , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for the real space partition of the many - body wavefunction , because the total particle number and translational momentum along @xmath32 direction are good quantum numbers in the subsystem , the real space partition is actually the same as that of the particle partition with the above probabilities . on the other hand ,",
    "the many - body model wavefunction can be in generally obtained from exact diagonalizing a model hamiltonian with hard - core interaction .",
    "for example , the laughlin , moore - read and read - rezayi wavefunctions are the most compact zero energy eigenstates for the two , three , and four body hard core hamiltonian . in the second quantized form , a @xmath53-body hard - core hamiltonian in an infinite plane",
    "@xcite is @xmath54 where the matrix elements for two , three and four - body interaction are following : @xmath55 in which @xmath56 is the antisymmetrizer  @xcite .",
    "another way of producing the trial wavefunctions is by the help of the recursive relation of the jack polynomials  @xcite .",
    "jack polynomials ( jacks ) are homogeneous symmetric polynomials specified by a rational parameter @xmath11 and a root configuration .",
    "they satisfy a number of differential equations@xcite and exhibit clustering properties@xcite .",
    "for example , jack is one of the polynomial solutions for calogero - sutherland hamiltonian : @xmath57 it was found  @xcite that the fqh wavefunctions for read - rezayi @xmath28-parafermion states can be exactly calculated recursively according to eq.([csmodel ] ) with a negative parameter @xmath11 and a root configuration ( or partition ) .",
    "the choice of the root configuration satisfies @xmath58 admissibility which means there can be at most @xmath16 particles in @xmath59 consecutive orbits .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is @xmath60 and the corresponding filling factor @xmath61 for bosonic system ( @xmath62 for fermionic system , the difference between the fermionic and bosonic wavefunction is just a vandermonde determinant ) .",

    "a quasihole / quasiparticle can be generally created by applied a tip potential .",
    "@xcite in the language of the jacks , a quasihole excitation can be created by inserting a flux quantum , or an unoccupied orbit in the root configuration . for a simple check , in fig.[fig1 ] ( a )",
    ", we plot the density profile for the ground state of 10 electrons and quasihole states of @xmath77 electrons in which the location of the quasihole is at the middle of the cylinder .",
    "the diameter of the quasihole is about @xmath78 if the first peak of the density profile is defined as the boundary of quasihole .",
