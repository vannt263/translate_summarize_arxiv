    "the proposed laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite , is expected to provide a variety of high - precision gravitational wave ( gw ) measurements .",
    "one of the most interesting targets for this space - based detector are the gws generated by stellar - mass compact objects inspiralling into ( super)massive black holes [ ( s)mbhs to ( a few)@xmath1 .",
    "we emphasize this point because the name `` supermassive black hole '' is often taken to refer to a hole with mass in the range @xmath2 .",
    "gw events from such black holes will typically be at frequencies too low for lisa s sensitivity . ] ] .",
    "accumulated astrometric observations provide strong support in favor of the existence of a `` dark '' compact object in the core of every galaxy ( for which the central parsec region can be resolved )  @xcite . with masses ranging between @xmath3 these objects",
    "are believed to be massive kerr black holes  @xcite .",
    "it is also believed that these holes are the `` quiet '' remnants of an older quasar population  @xcite .",
    "multi - body interactions in the `` cusp '' stellar population surrounding these smbhs can put stellar mass compact objects onto orbits that come close to the central black hole .",
    "if the object passes sufficiently close to the ( s)mbh , it may be captured and subsequently spiral in by the emission of gws @xcite .",
    "initially , the captured bodies are expected to be on `` generic '' orbits , i.e. , eccentric ( with eccentricity @xmath4 ) and inclined with respect to the central black hole s equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "these orbits evolve adiabatically due to gw emission , decreasing in eccentricity and periastron while the inclination of the orbit remains approximately constant , but increases slightly ( see  @xcite for an approximate description of the full inspiral ) .    for central black hole masses in the range @xmath5 , the gws emitted during the inspiral will be at frequencies close to the floor of the lisa noise curve ( @xmath6 mhz ) .",
    "lisa will detect the bursts of radiation emitted near periapse throughout the inspiral , but these will not be individually resolvable  @xcite unless they occur in our galaxy  @xcite . however , during the last few years of inspiral , when the small object is orbiting deep inside the smbh s gravitational field , gws are radiated continuously in the lisa band . during this phase ,",
    "the residual eccentricity is typically at @xmath7  @xcite and the orbital motion will exhibit extreme versions of relativistic effects ( e.g. , periastron and lense - thirring precession ) . as a consequence",
    ", the resulting gw signal will be strongly `` colored '' by these effects and will take a complicated form  @xcite . by complicating the waveform , these strong - field effects potentially make data analysis difficult ; but , they also encode a great deal of information about the strong field nature of the spacetime . by accurately measuring all of these effects , it is expected that we will be able to `` map '' the spacetime of the black hole  @xcite , probing its multipolar structure and verifying that it obeys the constraints that general relativity imposes on black hole solutions  @xcite .",
    "the expected amplitude of the signal from these extreme - mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) is about an order of magnitude below lisa s projected instrumental noise and , at low frequencies ( @xmath8 mhz ) , is several orders of magnitude below `` confusion noise '' produced by unresolved galactic binaries  @xcite .",
    "however , the signals will be observed for @xmath9 waveform cycles , and matched filtering will therefore allow detection of these signals with high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) out to a redshift @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "preliminary estimates suggest lisa could see as many as @xmath11 emri events during its lifetime @xcite , using a suitable `` semi - coherent '' search algorithm and provided that confusion noise can be efficiently reduced in the real data .",
    "matched filtering algorithms require the correlation of the detector s output data stream with a bank of waveform templates which describe the real signal with sufficient accuracy , covering the whole parameter space .",
    "the fact that we are dealing with a binary system of extreme mass ratio @xmath12 means that the gravitational waveform may be obtained accurately using black hole perturbation theory .",
    "the extreme mass ratio also guarantees that the orbital parameters evolve adiabatically under radiation reaction ; i.e. , they evolve on a much longer time scale than the orbital periods .",
    "this implies that within the radiation reaction time scale , the inspiral waveform can be approximated by `` snapshot '' waveforms  waveforms calculated by assuming that the small object is moving along a geodesic , neglecting backreaction for that short stretch of time .",
    "these snapshots are constructed using the teukolsky equation @xcite , an equation that describes the first order change to the curvature tensor of a black hole due to some perturbing source .",
    "accurate teukolsky - based ( tb ) snapshot waveforms have been calculated for inclined - circular orbits @xcite , equatorial - eccentric orbits @xcite and most recently , for a certain number of generic ( inclined - eccentric ) orbits  @xcite .",
    "the reader can find recent reviews on the modeling of emri waveforms and orbital dynamics in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "tb waveforms are computationally expensive to generate as they require the numerical integration of the teukolsky equation and summation over a large number of multipole modes . in this sense , these waveforms are not `` user - friendly '' , especially when it comes to realistic data analysis calculations where one has to handle a bank which contains @xmath13 of these waveforms  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the teukolsky formalism does not provide any information on `` conservative '' self - interaction effects . to compute these",
    ", one must use a self - force formalism .",
    "this approach is still under development and is very likely to be even more computationally expensive when it is completed ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "these difficulties have led to a need for the construction of approximate families of waveforms that capture the main features of the true signals , but which can be generated quickly in large numbers .",
    "such approximate waveforms are already being used for scoping out data analysis algorithms for the detection of emris in lisa data @xcite , and may ultimately play some role as fiducial detection templates in the final data analysis .",
    "one possible approach is to construct post - newtonian ( pn ) waveforms , which have the advantage of being analytic and therefore very easy to generate .",
    "post - newtonian emri waveforms have been computed in the schwarzschild spacetime for both quasi - circular @xcite and eccentric orbits  @xcite , and in the spacetime outside a slowly rotating kerr black hole for quasi - circular orbits  @xcite .",
    "recently another class of approximate waveforms have become available , based on various `` kludge '' approaches  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the kludges is to combine different prescriptions for the orbital evolution and waveform emission ( not necessarily in a self - consistent way ) .",
    "an `` analytic kludge '' ( ak ) was developed by barack and cutler @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . in their model",
    ", the small object is moving on a keplerian orbit , amended to include the effects of pericenter precession , lense - thirring precession , and inspiral from radiation reaction .",
    "the emitted gravitational waveforms are described by the lowest - order quadrupole formula .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an alternative way to construct kludge waveforms .",
    "this approach is much less amenable to analytic calculation , so we called it the `` numerical kludge '' ( nk ) .",
    "the first step of the nk is to produce an inspiral trajectory in `` phase space'' the space defined by the constants ( orbital energy , axial angular momentum , and `` carter constant '' ) which specify orbits ( up to initial conditions )  @xcite .",
    "the second step is to numerically integrate the kerr geodesic equations along this inspiral trajectory and hence obtain the boyer - lindquist coordinates of the inspiralling object as a function of time  @xcite .",
    "the final step is to construct a gravitational waveform from this inspiral trajectory .",
    "the approach to waveform construction that we take is to identify the boyer - lindquist coordinates of the source with spherical polar coordinates in flat - space .",
    "there are several different expressions available in the literature for the gravitational waveforms from orbits in flat space , and we apply these to our pseudo - flat - space trajectory to construct waveforms . specifically , we look at the quadrupole formula  @xcite , which is valid in the limit of weak - field ( i.e. , flat - space ) and slow motion .",
    "we also examine the quadrupole - octupole formula of bekenstein  @xcite , as well as a formula derived by press  @xcite .",
    "the press formula is also a weak - field expression , but is not restricted to slow - motion or small sources , and contains radiation at orders higher than quadrupole and octupole .",
    "the purpose of this paper to establish and delimit the accuracy and reliability of waveforms constructed in these various ways .",
    "we do this by comparing to tb waveforms . tb waveforms are currently the most accurate emri waveforms available . in most cases ,",
    "tb waveforms represent the emission from geodesic orbits  we mostly do not include the radiative evolution of orbital parameters in this work .",
    "( with one exception : because complete tb inspirals exist for zero - eccentricity orbits @xcite , we compare to a full inspiral in this case . )",
    "we compare the various nk waveforms with tb waveforms using an overlap integral which weights the waveforms in frequency space by the expected lisa noise curve , and maximizes the overlap with respect to time offsets .",
    "this overlap is identical to the test used to evaluate the efficiency of model waveforms as detection templates .",
    "we find that quadrupole - octupole nk waveforms are in remarkable agreement ( overlaps@xmath14 ) with tb waveforms for orbits with periastron @xmath15 .",
    "most orbits in the final year of the inspiral satisfy this restriction which means that nk waveforms are quite accurate over a considerable portion of the inspiral parameter space . for orbits that come below that radius ( mostly prograde orbits around rapidly spinning holes ) ,",
    "the agreement rapidly degrades ( although nk waveforms remain more accurate than post - newtonian or ak waveforms ) .",
    "this is not surprising  for such orbits the full tb waveform receives significant contributions from higher multipoles and back - scattering from the spacetime .",
    "these effects are _ ab initio _ absent in the nk prescription .",
    "waveforms generated using the press formula perform similarly well for @xmath15 , and slightly better than the quadrupole - octupole prescription for orbits where the contribution from higher harmonics is not negligible .",
    "the improvement in this relatively strong - field regime is only slight , however  we did not find any regime where the press formula is a significant improvement on the quadrupole - octupole prescription .",
    "we conclude that nk waveforms can accurately reproduce true gravitational waveforms in a large part of parameter space ; but , there is little gain from going beyond the quadrupole - octupole prescription .",
    "we also calculate kludge radiation _ fluxes _ by combining the quadrupole energy flux formula with exact geodesic motion and averaging in time ; such an analysis was done for schwarzschild orbits in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting fluxes typically compare well to the best available pn formula in the weak field , but provide a somewhat better estimate of the energy and angular momentum fluxes ( comparing to tb results ) for strong - field orbits .",
    "these fluxes also allows us to assess by how much the approximations which go into the kludge construction are inconsistent .",
    "since the inspiral trajectory and waveform construction are considered separately , kludge gws carry a different amount of energy and angular momentum to infinity than the inspiralling particle loses ( which is set by the formulas which determine the inspiral through orbital parameter space ) .",
    "it is important to bear this in mind when using kludge waveforms in computations , e.g. , for estimating snrs of lisa emri detections , and to have an estimate of the size of the inconsistency .",
    "finally , we describe how the kludge waveforms may be improved by including some of the conservative self - force effects , which may have a significant imprint on true inspiral waveforms .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ inventory ] provides a review of existing emri waveforms , paying special attention to the kludge semi - relativistic waveforms .",
    "details of how these waveforms can be generated are described . in section",
    "[ overlaps ] we discuss the overlap function between two waveforms , as this will be our main tool for comparison .",
    "section  [ results ] contains the results from the comparison between kludge and teukolsky - based waveforms and fluxes . in section  [ cons_pieces ] a method is outlined for including the conservative parts of the self - force in our kludge scheme .",
    "finally , we present a concluding discussion in section  [ conclusions ] . we shall use greek letters ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , etc . ) to denote spacetime indices , and latin letters ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , etc . ) to denote spatial indices ( unless explicitly stated otherwise ) . throughout the paper we adopt geometric units @xmath20 .",
    "presently , several types of emri waveforms are available . in broad terms , these waveforms fall into three categories : ( i ) those calculated numerically within the framework of black hole perturbation theory ( teukolsky - based , or tb waveforms ) , ( ii ) analytic waveforms which result from self - consistent pn expansions of the gw equations _ and _ orbital motion , and ( iii ) approximate semi - relativistic waveforms , or `` kludges '' .",
    "this third category is the focus of this paper .",
    "kludge waveforms are constructed by combining a flat spacetime wave - emission formula with either a fully relativistic treatment of particle motion ( resulting in the numerical kludge , or nk , waveforms ) , or some analytic approximation of this motion ( leading to the analytic kludge , or ak , waveforms ) .",
    "we shall examine the construction of nk waveforms , comparing them to tb waveforms ( the most accurate emri waveforms presently available ) . for completeness and background to this paper s discussions , we now briefly discuss each of the above waveform families .      the primary framework for black hole perturbation theory in a kerr background is the teukolsky formalism  @xcite , which encapsulates all gravitational radiative degrees of freedom in a single `` master '' wave equation  the `` teukolsky equation ''",
    " for the weyl scalars @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "a key feature of this equation is that it admits separation of variables in the frequency domain , which effectively reduces it to a pair of ordinary differential equations .",
    "there are extensive results in the literature on solutions of the teukolsky equation , starting from press and teukolsky  @xcite , detweiler  @xcite and sasaki and nakamura  @xcite .",
    "more recent work uses the teukolsky - sasaki - nakamura formalism , see refs .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussions and references on the subject .    to date",
    ", the teukolsky equation has been solved in the frequency domain for circular - inclined orbits  @xcite , eccentric - equatorial orbits  @xcite and most recently for a handful of generic ( eccentric - inclined ) orbits  @xcite .",
    "we make use of the waveforms generated by these various authors in this paper to assess the quality of our nk waveforms .",
    "recently , the teukolsky equation has also been solved directly in the time domain @xcite .",
    "time - domain calculations have the great advantage of speed , since they avoid the need for fourier decomposition and summation over all orbital frequency harmonics . however , these calculations are not yet mature enough to provide accurate waveforms from kerr orbits , because of the difficulty of representing the various @xmath23-functions appearing in the energy - momentum tensor of a point particle .    as a final remark , we should mention again that in all the above tb calculations ( either in the frequency or the time domain ) the motion of the small object is taken to be strictly geodesic .",
    "this is a reasonable first approximation since for an emri system the orbital evolution is adiabatic , i.e. , over a time interval of several orbits the motion is geodesic to high precision .",
    "however , for longer stretches of time ( @xmath24 ) the effects of gravitational back - reaction become significant and can not be ignored anymore .",
    "waveforms that take into account an evolving orbit ( and the conservative self - interaction ) require the computation of the gravitational self - force ( see  @xcite for an up - to - date review and a full list of references )",
    ". however , self - force waveforms are not yet available and are unlikely to be for the next few years .",
    "moreover , it is very likely that self - force calculations will remain quite computationally intensive ; as such , it is very likely that it will not be possible to generate self - force based waveforms in sufficient numbers to be used for lisa data analysis .",
    "it is therefore essential to investigate approximate , easy - to - use waveform models .",
    "most available analytic waveforms are based on post - newtonian expansions of the orbital dynamics and wave emission , an expansion that is of greatest relevance when the bodies are widely separated .",
    "these waveforms are typically constructed for a specific object or for restricted orbital motion .",
    "a significant amount of work has been done on modeling waveforms from two spinning bodies with comparable masses orbiting in precessing quasi - circular orbits ( a key gw source for both ground- and space - based detectors ) .",
    "kidder  @xcite has investigated the effects of spin - spin and spin - orbital coupling on the waveform from inspiralling binaries .",
    "the most recent investigation of pn waveforms ( and their application to data analysis ) for spinning binary systems may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "another promising approach is described in  @xcite , which is the first attempt to extend the `` effective - one - body '' method  @xcite to spinning compact objects . in parallel to modeling spinning binaries in quasi - circular orbits ,",
    "there has been significant progress in the construction of waveforms for eccentric , comparable mass binaries  @xcite . presently , there are no post - newtonian waveforms which include both eccentricity of the orbit and spins of the orbiting bodies .",
    "post - newtonian models are ultimately not so useful for modeling emris , since most of the gws observable to lisa are generated from a strong field region ( @xmath25 a few @xmath26 ) , where the pn expansion is unlikely to be reliable .",
    "one can , however , construct pn waveforms in the emri limit , accepting their certain unreliability as a way to develop a very `` quick and dirty '' set of tools for studying these waves .",
    "pn emri waveforms are available for systems of a test mass in a quasi - circular  @xcite or eccentric  @xcite orbit around a schwarzschild black hole , or in a quasi - circular orbit around a slowly rotating kerr black hole  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a class of approximate pn waveforms has been developed by barack and cutler @xcite .",
    "these `` analytic kludge '' ( ak ) waveforms are essentially phenomenological waveforms  they are constructed using the classic quadrupole waveforms for eccentric keplerian orbits derived in  @xcite , but with the relativistic effects of pericenter precession , lense - thirring precession , and inspiral imposed . though not as accurate as the nk waveforms described in this paper , the ak are very quick to generate , and have proven to be useful for computing the fisher information matrix in investigations of parameter measurement with emri gws @xcite .",
    "the overlap between ak and nk waveforms is high in the very weak field , but degrades as the orbital periapse is decreased ( see @xcite ; more detailed comparisons will be included in future papers on the semi - coherent algorithm currently in preparation ) . even for geodesic orbits , ak and nk waveforms with the _ same physical parameters _ drift out of phase quickly , since the frequency structure of the two waveform families is different .",
    "this arises because the ak uses a keplerian orbital parameterisation , compared to the geodesic parameterisation used in the nk . for an equatorial orbit with semi - latus rectum @xmath27 and eccentricity @xmath28 around a @xmath29 black hole of spin @xmath30 ,",
    "the azimuthal frequency of the nk waveform is @xmath31mhz compared to @xmath32mhz for the ak .",
    "these orbits will therefore be one cycle out of phase within @xmath33 hours .",
    "ak waveforms will thus not be particularly _ faithful _ templates .",
    "the problems can be mitigated by adjusting the orbital parameters of the ak waveform to improve the match with the nk , and the ak waveforms do capture the main features of true emri waveforms .",
    "for this reason , they may be quite _ effectual _ templates , but this has not yet been properly assessed . in the future ,",
    "the effectualness of the ak waveforms as detection templates will be investigated by using banks of ak templates to search for more accurate nk or tb waveforms embedded in noise .",
    "the idea behind the numerical kludge ( nk ) waveforms is to combine an exact particle trajectory ( up to inaccuracies in the phase space trajectory and conservative radiation reaction terms ) with an approximate expression for the gw emission . by including the particle dynamics accurately ,",
    "we hope to capture the main features of the waveform accurately , even if we are using an approximation for the waveform construction .",
    "the computation of nk waveforms proceeds in three steps .",
    "the first is to construct an inspiral trajectory in `` phase space ''  that is , the space of constants @xmath34 ( energy ) , @xmath35 ( axial angular momentum ) and @xmath36 ( carter constant ) which characterizes kerr black hole orbits ( up to initial conditions ) .",
    "the construction of the phase space trajectory has already been described in previous work @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall ( in most cases ) ignore the evolution of orbits due to radiation reactions .",
    "the procedure for waveform construction including orbital evolution is identical to that given here .",
    "the second step is to integrate the kerr geodesic equations along the inspiral trajectory and hence obtain the boyer - lindquist coordinates of the inspiralling object as a function of time  @xcite .",
    "the final step is to construct a gravitational waveform from this inspiral trajectory .",
    "we do this by identifying the boyer - lindquist coordinates ( @xmath37 ) with spherical polar coordinates in flat - space and then evaluating a flat - space emission formula for the corresponding flat - space source orbit .",
    "the idea of coupling a weak field formula with fully relativistic motion first appeared in papers by sasaki and ruffini  @xcite and was then investigated more thoroughly for a test - body orbiting a schwarzschild black hole by tanaka et al.@xcite .",
    "more recently , gair et al .",
    "@xcite looked at semi - relativistic fluxes for schwarzschild orbits and derived analytic expressions for the fluxes from arbitrary orbits .",
    "their focus was on highly eccentric orbits relevant to the capture problem .",
    "in all these cases , the authors were interested in computing semi - relativistic fluxes , rather than waveforms .",
    "while our focus is on waveforms rather than fluxes , in section  [ results_flux ] we do calculate semi - relativistic fluxes for kerr orbits , as these results have not yet appeared in the literature .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we describe the two stages of waveform generation ( ignoring backreaction ) :",
    "( i ) the computation of a trajectory , and ( ii ) the computation of a gravitational waveform from an arbitrary trajectory .",
    "the first step in constructing a numerical kludge waveform is to compute the trajectory that the inspiralling body follows in the boyer - lindquist coordinates of the kerr spacetime of the central black hole .",
    "ignoring radiation reaction , this path is a kerr geodesic .",
    "geodesic motion in the kerr space - time is well - known  @xcite and is governed by a set of first - order differential equations :    & = & , + & = & , + & = & v _ , + & = & v_t ,    where the various `` potentials '' are defined by    v_r & = & ^2 - , + v _ & = & q -^2 , + v _ & = & - ae + , + v_t & = & a ( l_z - ae^2 ) + .    here , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the constants @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the three first integrals of the motion : @xmath34 is the orbital energy ; @xmath35 is the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the black hole s spin axis ; and @xmath36 is known as the `` carter constant '' .",
    "this last constant is the relativistic generalization of the `` third integral '' used to separate the equations which describe orbits in an axisymmetric gravitational potential ( a result which is particularly well - known in the literature describing orbits in galactic potentials  @xcite ) . in the spherical ( i.e. , schwarzschild ) limit",

    "the slow - motion nature of expressions  ( [ quad ] ) and  ( [ octup ] ) suggests that they might be bad models for waveforms generated by orbits venturing deep inside the central bh s spacetime .",
    "the rich multipole structure of the true waveform from such orbits is poorly reproduced , as any slow - motion approximation essentially truncates the sum over multipoles .",
    "the press formula  ( [ press ] ) includes contributions at all multipoles and so might be expected to handle these contributions quite well . however , it turns out that it does not perform that much better than the quadrupole - octupole waveform in this regime .",

    ".    direct visual inspection of the waveforms gives some indication of how well the nk and tb waveforms match . in each of the cases",

    "the finer structure in the tb waveforms is clearly not reproduced by the quadrupole - octupole kludge waveforms . as we have discussed , these features are the imprints of higher multipole components in the radiation which are amplified by back - scattering , and thus are not expected to appear in the nk waveforms .",
    "waveforms generated using the press formula ( not shown ) do have some finer features due to the presence of higher multipole components , as we might have hoped , but they are not nearly as complicated as the structure of the tb waveforms .",
    "one also notices that for certain parts of the waveforms ( e.g. , fig .  [ circ3 ] )",
    ", there is a disagreement in the amplitude while the phase is accurately reproduced .",
    "this amplitude discrepancy is periodic , i.e. , the points where the amplitude is poorly reproduced occur at regular intervals .",
    "this suggests that the kludge waveforms are missing some periodic components , as we might expect since they are truncated expansions in multipole moments .",
    "indeed , the amplitude discrepancy is less pronounced in the press waveform , which includes contributions at all multipoles . for the purposes of data analysis ,",
    "it is important to have templates with a high overlap with the true signals , and to achieve that it is much more important that the waveform phase is reproduced rather than the waveform amplitude . the waveform phase is determined by the orbit generating the gravitational radiation .",
    "the fact that the kludge waveforms are based on true geodesic orbits is presumably the reason that we find , _ post facto _ , such impressively high overlaps with tb waveforms and especially for those from circular - inclined orbits .",
    "a comprehensive set of data for the overlaps between nk and tb waveforms is given in tables  [ o - lap_equat ] , [ o - lap_circ ] and [ o - lap_generic ] in the appendix .",
    "these were computed using the overlap function described in section  [ overlaps ] and assuming a central black hole mass of @xmath149 .",
    "this was chosen since preliminary event rate estimates suggest the inspirals of @xmath150 bhs into @xmath151 smbhs will dominate the lisa detection rate @xcite .",
    "these tables indicate that if the orbital periastron @xmath152 , the overlap between tb waveforms and both the quadrupole - octupole and press waveforms stays above @xmath153 .",
    "we also find that both these expressions have better performance than the pure quadrupole waveforms ( [ quad ] ) , but there is little difference between quadrupole - octupole and press waveforms .",
    "the kludge and tb waveforms begin to deviate significantly for strong - field , ultra - relativistic orbits with @xmath154 , with the overlap dropping to @xmath155 for orbits that come very close to the horizon .",
    "disappointingly , the press waveforms do not seem to do much better than the quadrupole - octupole waveforms in this strong field regime , despite the inclusion of additional multipole components .",
    "the press waveforms include only the `` direct '' contribution to the higher multipoles , i.e. , the piece that arises from fast motion in flat spacetime .",
    "in true emri gws , the higher multipole contributions are significantly enhanced by `` tail '' effects , i.e. , the backscattering of radiation from the background geometry .",
    "since we are using the press formula in flat space , we do not include this back - scattering enhancement .",
    "this is presumably why using the kludge press waveforms does not significantly improve the overlap with tb waveforms .",
    "the press waveforms do perform consistently better for circular orbits and weak - field eccentric orbits , but the difference between the two approaches is usually small ( with the exception of a few cases which we discuss in more detail later ) .",
    "we conclude that the quadrupole - octupole waveform model is sufficient and there is not much gain from using the computationally more intensive press formula .    to summarize",
    ", we find that kludge waveforms are accurate  and very quick to generate  substitutes for tb waveforms for all orbits with periapse @xmath15 . in schwarzschild ,",

    "the minimal periapse is at even larger radii , so that even weaker restrictions must be imposed on the eccentricity at plunge for the kludge to be valid .",
    "in contrast , for prograde orbits ( @xmath159 ) , an increased black hole spin allows stable orbits to exist much deeper in the strong field . for @xmath160 ,",
    "the separatrix for circular orbits is at @xmath161 for orbits with inclinations of @xmath162 respectively ; for orbits with a plunge eccentricity of @xmath163 , it is at @xmath164 for the same inclinations . as @xmath165 , the separatrix of equatorial orbits decreases even more , asymptotically approaching @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "kludge waveforms are not particularly good in this regime , with overlaps @xmath167 ; fortunately , this corresponds to a comparatively small region of parameter space .",
    "the evolution proceeds through this region very quickly , so we do not lose much signal - to - noise ratio by failing to match the waveforms in this region .",
    "if the overlap between a given signal and the best - fit template in a search bank is less than @xmath103 , this leads to a decrease in the maximum distance to which that signal can be detected , and a corresponding reduction in event rate . for the purposes of detection ,",
    "overlaps as low as @xmath168 might well be considered good enough , if the astrophysical event rate is sufficiently large @xcite . however , for the purposes of parameter estimation , much higher overlaps ( @xmath169 ) will be required in general .",
    "it is clear from the results in this paper that this is only partially achievable by the existing family of kludge waveforms .",
    "nonetheless , these waveforms might be useful for lisa data analysis as search or detection templates over some ( perhaps a large part ) of the astrophysically relevant portion of the @xmath170 parameter space .",
    "the waveforms may also provide sufficiently accurate estimation of the source parameters ( in certain regions of parameter space ) that they could be used as the first stage in a hierarchical search .",
    "the purpose of such a search would be to identify `` interesting '' regions of parameter space for follow up with more accurate waveforms .",
    "this is the main conclusion of this paper .",
    "however , the regions where kludge waveforms are good enough must be identified more carefully by comparison to accurate _",
    "inspiral _ waveforms .",
    "as we have discussed earlier , the flat space emission formula used in the construction of the nk waveforms ignores all effects of scattering from the background curvature .",
    "these `` tail '' terms make a significant contribution to the waveform structure , and build up over the course of an inspiral .",
    "although we have found good overlaps with geodesic waveforms and circular - inclined inspiral waveforms ( see section  [ inspcomp ] ) , comparisons to inspirals of eccentric - inclined orbits are required to properly assess the importance of including the tail terms .",

    "we have deliberately chosen a case for which including higher harmonics significantly ( @xmath182 ) improves the overlap , especially in the presence of white dwarf confusion noise ( see table [ o - lap_generic ] ) .",

    "we may quantify the agreement in the waveforms by again using the overlap function , which we plot as a function of truncation time in figure  [ inspolap ] for three different masses of the central black hole .",

    "this is achieved by taking a time average of the instantaneous flux expression inside the angle brackets , i.e. , @xmath214 where @xmath203 is an appropriate averaging time .",
    "it is important to ensure that this averaging time is long enough . for circular",
    "equatorial orbits , the symmetries of the system ensure that the instantaneous and averaged fluxes are identical . for an eccentric equatorial orbit ,",
    "there is only one periodicity in the flux  the period of the radial motion . thus integrating over one radial period is sufficient to give an accurate average flux . for generic orbits ,",
    "the averaging is more complicated since the periods of the motion in the radial and @xmath48 directions are in general different and non - commensurate .",
    "the averaging time therefore has to be long enough to encompass several periods of both motions .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by plotting @xmath215 as function of @xmath203 for a generic orbit with parameters @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "the flux has been computed using the pure quadrupole waveforms ( [ quad ] ) .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the averaged flux converges over time , and this convergence is more rapid for the lower eccentricity orbit .",

    "we show the angular distribution of the gravitational radiation from an emri orbit of given @xmath44 and @xmath43 , but for several different orbital inclinations , @xmath62 .",
    "this picture is more or less typical of the majority of orbits .",
    "the variation of the energy flux with the sky position of the observer is indicative of beaming .",
    "this is strongest for equatorial orbits and reduces as the orbital inclination is increased .",
    "equatorial orbits are restricted to a single plane , while inclined orbits wander through more of the spacetime .",
    "this wandering averages out the beaming over the sky .",
    "the larger the orbital inclination , the more of the phase space the body explores , the more averaging occurs and the more homogeneous the sky distribution of the energy flux .    in tables  [ tab3 ] & [ tab4 ] we show flux data for a series of orbits and black hole spins .",
    "we tabulate the flux computed via solution of the teukolsky equation , and fluxes computed using quadrupole kludge waveforms and equation ( [ improvedot ] ) .",
    "we quote only the quadrupole results since the difference from using either the quadrupole - octupole or press waveforms is quite small . as we mentioned in section  [ inventory ] , tanaka et.al .",
    "@xcite and more recently gair et al .",
    "@xcite computed approximate fluxes for schwarzschild orbits based on the quadrupole waveform approximation ( [ quad ] ) . for a random choice of orbits",
    "we have found excellent agreement with their results .    for further comparison",
    ", we also tabulate the `` kludge '' fluxes that have been used to construct inspirals and inspiral waveforms for scoping out lisa data analysis .",
    "the difference between these and our current results is a measure of the inconsistency in the kludged inspiral waveforms . in constructing an inspiral waveform ,",
    "one set of expressions is used to evolve the orbit ( given in @xcite ) , and a different prescription ( the one described here ) is used to generate the waveform .",
    "this means that the energy carried by the kludge gws is not equal to the energy lost by the orbit that is supposedly emitting these gws .",
    "this leads to inaccuracies when the kludge waveforms are used to compute snrs @xcite . in the original prescription for kludge",
    "inspirals @xcite , the phase space trajectories were generated using the leading order post - newtonian results of ryan @xcite , evaluated for relativistic orbital parameters .",

    "the new expression for @xmath215 is complicated and we do not quote it here , but we also tabulate those results in tables  [ tab3 ] & [ tab4 ] , under the heading `` gg '' .",
    "we note that in true black hole spacetimes , energy and angular momentum are lost into the horizon as well as to infinity .",
    "the teukolsky equation provides a prediction for both the flux of radiation at infinity and the flux down the black hole horizon . when using eqs .",
    "( [ genedot])([improvjdot ] ) , we are only computing the energy and angular momentum carried to infinity in the kludge gws .",
    "this should therefore only be compared to the teukolsky flux at infinity .",
    "the discrepancy between these numbers is then a measure of the error associated with using the kludge waveforms to estimate signal to noise ratios for true inspirals .",
    "the tb fluxes quoted in the tables are accordingly just the infinity piece of the fluxes .",
    "when computing inspirals , which was the purpose for which the `` gg '' expressions were derived , the energy and angular momentum lost by the orbit should include the horizon piece of the flux .",
    "this should be born in mind when considering the flux tables . however , the relative contribution of the horizon flux is only significant in the extremely strong field regime where both the `` gg '' expressions and the kludge fluxes cease to be valid .    in general , we find that the fluxes computed from the kludge waveforms agree less well with teukolsky results than do the `` gg '' fluxes",
    ". the kludge fluxes do improve over `` gg '' results for some retrograde orbits , and for some orbits with high eccentricity , but these are orbits for which the `` gg '' expressions are known to lack some terms . once the `` gg",
    "'' expressions are further improved along the lines discussed in @xcite , it is likely that the `` gg '' fluxes will always be closer to tb results .",
    "typically , the fluxes computed from the kludge waveforms underestimate the actual energy and angular momentum lost by the orbit , and also underestimate the `` gg '' fluxes .",
    "this suggests that inspiral waveforms that combine the two prescriptions will carry too little energy to infinity for the evolution seen in the orbit ( or equivalently , the inspiral will proceed too quickly for the energy being carried by the gws ) . in @xcite ,",
    "a similar comparison was performed for inspirals into schwarzschild black holes and they found that the kludge gws contained _ too much _ energy , in contrast to this result .",
    "this difference arises primarily because , in that paper , inspirals were evolved using the `` ryan '' fluxes , rather than the more up to date `` gg '' fluxes .",
    "the signal to noise ratio squared of a monochromatic source contributed when the frequency is in the range @xmath222 is proportional to @xmath223 .",
    "the kludge waveforms get @xmath224 largely correct ( otherwise the high overlaps would not be maintained ) , but the error in @xmath215 , arising from an amplitude discrepancy , will lead to an error in snrs computed using kludge inspiral waveforms . since @xmath215 is in general an underestimate , the kludge snrs will probably be underestimates of the true snrs .",
    "the discrepancy in @xmath215 is at most a few tens of percent .",
    "a discrepancy of @xmath225 _ throughout _ the inspiral would lead to an error in the snr of only @xmath226",
    ". however , the actual error will be much less , since for the majority of the inspiral the kludge @xmath215 is much closer to the true value , and , as we saw earlier , most of the snr comes from the early inspiral .",
    "the kludge waveforms are thus accurate enough to be used for snr calculations to estimate astrophysical event rates @xcite , in which the astrophysical uncertainties far outweigh the waveform uncertainties .",
    "however , we must emphasize that amplitude discrepancies of this sort do not limit the applicability of the kludge waveforms for data analysis , provided the overlaps with true waveforms are high .",
    "if the kludge waveforms were used for parameter extraction , such discrepancies would lead to an error in the distance estimate only . in practice , we are likely to use kludge waveforms for _ detection _ rather than source characterization , and for that the waveform amplitude is irrelevant .",

    "table  [ tab4 ] contains the relevant data together with our kludge results . for a periastron",
    "@xmath229 the error in using the kludge fluxes is @xmath230 and rapidly decays ( grows ) as we move to larger ( smaller ) periapse . in this table",

    "this energy loss data can be used to estimate the capture rate of compact objects by a single massive black hole .",
    "we note that it is clear from table  [ tab4 ] that the `` gg '' results perform quite poorly for parabolic orbits .",
    "this is because the `` gg '' results are built on a small eccentricity expansion , which is no longer valid when @xmath227 . at present",
    "the kludge fluxes are closer to tb results than the `` gg '' fluxes where comparisons can be made , and most likely are better approximations for the other orbits as well .",
    "the performace of the `` gg '' fluxes for highly eccentric orbits is now being improved , and it is likely that the next generation prescription will be able to approximate tb fluxes accurately for orbits of all eccentricities .",
    "in the preceding sections , we have shown that kludge waveforms do very well at reproducing the gw emission from geodesic orbits , and , if coupled to an accurate prescription for the radiation fluxes , can very accurately reproduce the gw emission from inspirals .",
    "however , the radiation fluxes are not the whole story , as they represent only the dissipative piece of the self - force . in true inspirals",
    ", the self - force also has a `` conservative '' component .",
    "this does not lead to evolution of the orbital parameters and hence can not be determined from the flux of energy , angular momentum and carter constant , but does lead to a change in the phasing of the gravitational waveform .",
    "there has been some debate recently about the importance of including the conservative pieces of the self - force when constructing templates for emri source detection @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible that these corrections will be needed for detection , at least for some range of source parameters ; these terms will certainly be needed for parameter determination .",
    "we aim to demonstrate here how easily conservative terms can be included in the kludge waveform prescription .",
    "the conservative part of the self - force will include an oscillatory component , which averages to zero , and a secular piece that leads to accumulation of a phase error over time .",
    "the net effect of the secular piece is that , for a given set of orbital parameters ( @xmath44 , @xmath43 and @xmath62 ) , the average frequencies of the motion in the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath56 directions will differ from the expected values for a kerr geodesic .",
    "the conservative self - force might also affect the harmonic structure of the gws , but the dominant contribution will come from orbital dephasing . in the spirit of the kludge , we will now try to account for this part of the effect .",
    "the effect of the conservative self - force can be characterized by the changes in the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath56 frequencies , averaged over many orbits .",
    "we denote these frequency changes by @xmath234 , @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "conservative effects can then be included in the kludge orbital determination simply by amending the evolution equations for the angular variables @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath56 given earlier ( eqs .",
    "( [ dpsidt ] ) , ( [ dchidt ] ) , and  ( [ geoeqphi ] ) respectively ) : @xmath237 the subscript `` geo '' denotes expressions for the phase derivatives in geodesic orbits given earlier . in general , the frequency shifts will depend on the orbital parameters , and for an inspiralling source we assume that these are evaluated for the instantaneous orbital parameters , as discussed in section  [ insptraj ] .    to evaluate these frequency shifts in the framework of black hole perturbation theory",
    "requires self - force calculations @xcite which are not yet fully developed , but should be on the timescale of a few years .",
    "once the self - force corrections are known , it should be possible to use them to compute the effective frequency shifts in the framework we use here , i.e. , objects moving on geodesics of the kerr spacetime , the parameters of which evolve with time . in the meantime , conservative corrections are already known in the post - newtonian framework up to 3.5pn order @xcite .",
    "these can be used to compute leading order conservative corrections to include in the kludge .",
    "we outline here a general method for such a calculation , illustrated by the simplest case of a 1pn conservative correction to circular orbits in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the generalisation to 3.5pn corrections for arbitrary orbits in kerr will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the greatest difficulty in such a computation is to identify coordinates between the post - newtonian and perturbative formalism .",
    "the former calculations tend to be carried out in harmonic coordinates while the natural coordinate system to use for the latter are black - hole centered coordinates , like the boyer - lindquist coordinate system .",
    "the best approach is to use asymptotic observables , specifically the orbital frequency , perihelion precession frequency , orbital plane precession frequency and their first time derivatives , to identify coordinates between the two formalisms and find the missing conservative pieces .",
    "the power of this approach is that it corrects the kludge in a physically meaningful way ; however , this comes at the cost of an effective @xmath238 redefinition of the orbital parameters , where @xmath239 . for extreme mass ratios , @xmath240",
    ", this is less than the expected error in parameter determination @xcite .",
    "the post - newtonian model has two particles moving on orbits ( expanded to the stated post - newtonian order ) and evolving via post - newtonian radiation reaction expressions .",
    "these orbits include conservative corrections to geodesic motion .",
    "for the case of circular orbits in schwarzschild we find at 1pn and with mass ratio corrections at linear order only that the orbital frequency and its time derivative are given by @xcite @xmath241 in the above , we use @xmath26 to denote the mass of the primary ( not the total mass as is conventional in the post - newtonian approach ) , and @xmath242 to denote the post - newtonian orbital semi - major axis . in the kludge ,",
    "the orbit is a geodesic of the kerr spacetime , and the orbit is evolved according to the prescription in @xcite . for circular equatorial orbits in schwarzschild",
    "we have ( at 1pn order ) @xmath243 here , @xmath47 denotes the schwarzschild radial coordinate of the orbit .",
    "if we write @xmath244 and substitute into expression ( [ klom ] ) or ( [ klomdot ] ) , keeping corrections at 1pn order and linear in the mass ratio , we can compare to equations ( [ pnom ] ) or ( [ pnomdot ] ) and solve for @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "the comparison between ( [ klom ] ) and ( [ pnom ] ) gives a different result for @xmath246 and @xmath247 than the comparison between ( [ klomdot ] ) and ( [ pnomdot ] ) , since the kludge prescription ignores conservative effects . we therefore write @xmath248 and solve simultaneously for @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 [ bearing in mind that ( [ klrdot ] ) not ( [ klomdot ] ) is the fundamental quantity to examine for computing inspiral in the kludge ] .",
    "we find that the required parameters are @xmath251 we note that the correction to @xmath252 scales as @xmath253 , compared to the scaling of @xmath254 , which is @xmath255 . in the weak - field ,",
    "@xmath256 , the conservative correction will be much more significant than the radiative correction .",
    "this is in keeping with what pound et al .",
    "@xcite found for a particle moving under an electromagnetic self - force .",
    "extension to generic orbits is straightforward . in that case",
    ", we have two extra observables , the perihelion precession frequency and the rate of precession of the orbital plane , and two extra coordinate dependent orbital parameters , the eccentricity and orbital inclination .",
    "identifying the rate of change of the orbital frequency , the perihelion precession frequency and the orbital plane precession frequency between the post - newtonian and kludge approaches gives us a relation between the two sets of coordinates .",
    "comparing the values of the frequencies then tells us which @xmath236 , @xmath257 and @xmath258 must be added into the kludge . in all of this",
    "we have chosen implicitly to identify the two masses , @xmath26 and @xmath16 , and the spin , @xmath60 , between the post - newtonian and kludge models . to our minds",
    ", it makes more sense to hold these parameters fixed between the two models , at the cost of modifying the definitions of the orbital elements @xmath259 .",
    "once self - force data is available , it will be possible to obtain a consistent solution for the conservative correction in boyer - lindquist like coordinates by using fits to the self - force results . in using equation ( [ klrdot ] ) ,",
    "we have implicitly assumed the relationship between energy / angular momentum and the radial coordinate is unchanged by the self - force .",
    "however , in self - force calculations , the energy and angular momentum of circular orbits at a given radius do change as a result of conservative effects .",
    "this is merely a manifestation of the @xmath238 redefinition of @xmath47 implicit in this approach that we mentioned earlier . when comparing to self - force calculations , it will be preferable to include this redefinition of energy as well as the conservative corrections to @xmath252 so that @xmath47 maintains it s meaning . ultimately , both approaches are equivalent .",
    "another way to obtain @xmath249 and @xmath250 for equation ( [ klpluscons ] ) is by expanding @xmath260 as a function of @xmath252 in both the pn and kludge approaches .",
    "matching various orders in this expansion gives @xmath249 and @xmath250 directly without having to simultaneously solve for the coordinate transformation .",
    "the function @xmath261 is a gw observable , so this approach ensures that the kludge will have the correct leading order form for this observable .",
    "however , this is a series truncated at a given pn order , so it will be important to assess how significant the omitted terms can be .",
    "it is likely that using the present kludge , augmented with conservative corrections up to 3.5pn order computed as outlined above , will do well enough at reproducing the phasing of true inspiral waveforms . as discussed in @xcite , it is likely that the conservative terms will be most important in the weak - field regime , where the post - newtonian results are valid . in the regime where the post - newtonian corrections cease to be valid",
    ", the contribution of conservative corrections to the phase evolution may be much less critical .",
    "this will be investigated in future work .",
    "if the pn expansion is not sufficient , the kludge can be augmented using fits to the results of self - force calculations as described .",
    "in this paper we have provided a simple , `` easy - to - use '' , prescription for approximating the gravitational waveforms generated by test - bodies inspiralling into kerr black holes .",
    "these `` kludge '' waveforms are constructed by combining familiar flat - spacetime wave equations with a true geodesic trajectory in the kerr spacetime . despite its formal inconsistency this hybrid approximation results in remarkably accurate waveforms , which we have established by comparison to rigorous teukolsky - based perturbative waveforms .",
    "we find an impressive overlap between the kludge and tb waveforms for particles on geodesic orbits ( i.e. , ignoring radiation - reaction ) .",
    "this overlap is @xmath262 over a significant portion of the relevant orbital parameter space",
    ". significant degradation ( overlap reduced to @xmath155 ) occurs for strong field orbits around rapidly spinning black holes . for such cases ,",
    "the contribution of the radiation backscattered from the background spacetime is sizable ; this effect is not included in the present formulation of the kludge waveforms . as a rough ( but reliable ) rule of thumb",
    ", we have found that kludge waveforms work well for kerr orbits with periaspe distance @xmath263 , irrespective of the black hole spin .",
    "we have experimented with three different types of kludge waveforms generated using three different solutions of the flat - spacetime gravitational wave - equation : quadrupole , quadrupole - octupole and `` press '' waveforms @xcite .",
    "the latter choice includes contributions from all multipole moments of the orbiting body .",
    "we have concluded that for all practical purposes the quadrupole - octupole waveforms are the optimal choice , nearly as accurate as the press waveforms while much quicker and easier to generate .    within the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "we have applied our method to calculate full inspiral kludge waveforms taking into account orbital evolution .",
    "this realistic scenario requires an additional `` kludge '' for describing the orbital evolution itself .",
    "our earlier work @xcite,@xcite provides such a scheme : exact geodesic orbital dynamics coupled with approximate pn - based expressions for the fluxes .",
    "the resulting waveforms still have very high overlaps with available teukolsky - based inspirals for circular - inclined orbits .",
    "the overlap is @xmath264 even when the inspiral terminates in the strong field region .",
    "this result indicates the kludge will be a very useful tool for generating inspiral waveforms .",
    "however , as yet teukolsky - based inspirals are available only for circular - inclined orbits . only when comparisons for generic inspiral orbits are possible will we be able to firmly identify the range of applicability of these kludge waveforms .    we have also used the kludge waveforms to estimate the fluxes of energy and angular momentum carried away in gws from geodesic orbits .",
    "we have found that such kludge fluxes in general are not as accurate for evolving inspirals as the post - newtonian based expressions described in @xcite .",
    "the kludge fluxes do provide us with an estimate of the error in using kludge waveforms for snr calculations , and our results suggest the kludge waveforms will tend to underestimate the true snrs if anything .    the area where these kludge waveforms will find most use is in the development of emri data analysis for lisa .",
    "the combination of accuracy and simplicity of generation has already made these waveforms invaluable tools for the study of data analysis issues .",
    "it seems quite plausible that the waveforms may also play a role in the final search of the lisa data .",
    "one use could be for estimation of the waveform parameters as the first stage in a hierarchical search .",
    "the high faithfulness of these waveforms suggest that they may be able to set fairly tight bounds on the parameters of the emitting system",
    ". this will be extremely useful input for the second stage of the search where the system parameters will be refined using more accurate waveforms .",
    "however , as we discussed before , the kludge waveforms at present do not include some important physical features that we expect in true inspirals .",
    "only when accurate teukolsky or self - force based waveforms are available for generic inspiral orbits will we be able to fully quantify the range of validity and level of accuracy of the kludge waveforms .",
    "time - frequency searches @xcite could also be used to detect emris in the first stage of a hierarchical search .",
    "these can typically detect emri events at about half the distance of the semi - coherent search @xcite , without the use of templates . a template with overlap of @xmath265 with the true signal can detect that signal at about half the distance of the correct template .",
    "the nk waveforms can easily achieve overlaps of @xmath265 through most of parameter space , particularly given the @xmath266 week integration times needed for the semi - coherent approach .",
    "it is clear therefore that a first stage semi - coherent search using kludge waveforms would have a greater reach than time - frequency methods , and would put tighter constraints on the parameters .",
    "however , this would come at a much greater computational cost .",
    "the final lisa search will undoubtedly employ both methods at various stages in the analysis .",
    "a further possible application of kludge waveforms is to the study of non - kerr emris .",
    "it is hoped that lisa observations will allow `` spacetime - mapping '' of black holes @xcite , @xcite , and thereby test the no - hair theorem . to carry out such tests",
    "quantitatively will require waveform templates , which incorporate the deviation from kerr in the spacetime structure as a set of suitable parameters ( e.g. , multipole moments @xcite ) .",
    "the development of rigorous non - kerr emri waveforms is a very difficult task , since generic spacetimes lack some symmetries that allowed the formulation of the teukolsky framework for the kerr spacetime .",
    "one way to make progress is to construct kludged waveforms in non - kerr spacetimes along the lines outlined in this paper .",
    "our results for the kerr spacetime suggest that such kludged waveforms may well be sufficiently accurate for qualitative , and even quantitative studies of non - kerr emris .",
    "all that is required is the integration of geodesic equations in the non - kerr spacetime and thus kludge waveforms provide a computationally quick and easy tool to study `` bumpy '' and `` quasi - kerr '' spacetime mapping @xcite .",
    "the kludged waveforms / inspirals presented in this and a companion paper @xcite could be considered as `` second generation '' , an improvement of the original simple version of quadrupole waveforms @xcite and inspirals @xcite . certainly , there is space for further improvement .",
    "the inclusion of conservative self - force effects on the inspiral is an obvious next step , and we have already discussed here how this can be achieved by calculating the relevant orbital frequency shifts for circular schwarzschild orbits .",
    "we can also further improve waveform generation by including the back - scattering effect arising from the propagation of the gws in a curved spacetime .    in summary ,",
    "given the present level of performance of our kludge waveforms and inspirals and their prospects of improvement , we feel that they should remain valuable tools for lisa source modelling for the coming years .",

    "<S> may then be computed from the multipole moments of the trajectory in these coordinates , using well known solutions of the linearised gravitational perturbation equations in flat spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> we compute waveforms using a standard slow - motion quadrupole formula , a quadrupole / octupole formula , and a fast - motion , weak - field formula originally developed by press . </S>",
    "<S> we assess these approximations by comparing to accurate waveforms obtained by solving the teukolsky equation in the adiabatic limit ( neglecting gw backreaction ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the kludge waveforms do extremely well at approximating the true gravitational waveform , having overlaps with the teukolsky waveforms of @xmath0 or higher over most of the parameter space for which comparisons can currently be made . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , we find these kludges to be of such high quality ( despite their ease of calculation ) that it is possible they may play some role in the final search of lisa data for emris . </S>"
