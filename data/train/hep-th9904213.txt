    "we will focus on a simpler case , that of @xmath1 broken to @xmath0 .",
    "we will construct a set of effective supergravity theories that contain an unbroken , linearly realized @xmath0 supersymmetry , as well as a spontaneously broken , nonlinearly realized , @xmath1 .",
    "heuristically , it might seem impossible to partially break @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "the argument runs as follows .",

    "suppose that one supersymmetry is not broken , so q |0  =  |q |0  =  0  .",
    "because of the supersymmetry algebra , this implies that the hamiltonian also annihilates the vacuum , h |0  =  0  .",
    "then , according to the supersymmetry algebra , ( |s s + s |s ) |0  =  0  .",
    "[ ssbar ] for a positive definite hilbert space , this leads one to conclude that s |0",
    "=  |s |0  =  0  .",
    "this argument can be evaded by two loopholes .",
    "the first is that in a spontaneously broken theory , one can only consider the algebra of the _ currents _ , since the charges of the spontaneously broken symmetries do not exist rigorously .",
    "the second exploits the fact that in covariantly - quantized supergravity theories , the gravitino @xmath8 is a gauge field with negative - norm components , so the hilbert space does not have positive norm .",
    "there are by now many examples of partial supersymmetry breaking which take advantage the first loophole .",
    "the first was given by hughes , liu and polchinski @xcite , who showed that supersymmetry is partially broken on the world volume of an @xmath0 supersymmetric 3-brane propagating in six - dimensional superspace .",
    "later , bagger and galperin @xcite used the techniques of coleman , wess , zumino @xcite , and volkov @xcite to construct an effective field theory of partial supersymmetry breaking , with the broken supersymmetry realized nonlinearly .",
    "they found that the goldstone fermion could belong to an @xmath0 chiral _ or _ an @xmath0 vector multiplet .",
    "antoniadis , partouche and taylor discovered another realization in which the goldstone fermion is contained in an @xmath1 vector multiplet @xcite .",

    "however , a shift in the stress - energy tensor corresponds to a shift in the vacuum energy .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism of partial breaking might be different in supergravity theories .",
