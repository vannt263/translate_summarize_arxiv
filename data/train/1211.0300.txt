    "the notion of poissonian ensembles of markov loops ( loop soups ) was introduced by lawler and werner in @xcite in the context of two dimensional brownian motion ( it already appeared informally in @xcite ) : the loops of a brownian loop soup on a domain @xmath3 are the points of a poisson point process with intensity @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a positive real and @xmath6 is the brownian loop measure on @xmath7 .",
    "loop clusters induced by a brownian loop soup were used to give a construction of the conformal loop ensembles ( cle ) in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they are defined as follows : _ two loops @xmath8 and @xmath9 are said to be in the same cluster if one can find a finite chain of loops @xmath10 such that @xmath11 , @xmath12 and for all @xmath13 , @xmath14_. poissonian ensembles of markov loops can also be defined on graphs . they were studied in details in @xcite and @xcite . in particular poissonian ensembles of loops on the integer lattice @xmath15 induced by simple ( nearest neighbor )",
    "random walks give a discrete version of brownian loop soup ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study loop clusters induced by markov loop ensembles on graphs .",
    "the facts presented here , which are built on the results presented in @xcite , are more elementary than in the brownian loop soup theory , but they point out that poissonian ensembles of markov loops and related partitions are of more general interest . the examples we develop show relations with several theories : coalescence , percolation and random graphs .    in section 1 , we recall the different objects needed to define the markovian loop clusters on a graph and the coalescent process induced by the partition of vertices they define . in section 2 ,",
    "we state general properties of the clusters and establish some formulae useful to study the semigroup of the coalescent process . in the last three sections we address several aspects of the loop clusters induced by a simple random walk killed at a constant rate @xmath16 on different graphs :    * on @xmath17 , the loop cluster model reduces to a renewal process .",
    "we establish a convergence result by rescaling space by @xmath18 , killing rate by @xmath19 and let @xmath19 converge to @xmath20 . *",
    "the loop cluster model can be seen as a percolation model with two parameters @xmath5 and @xmath16 .",
    "bernoulli percolation appears as a limit if @xmath5 and @xmath16 tend to @xmath21 so that @xmath22 converges to a positive real .",
    "we show that a non - trivial percolation threshold occurs for the loop cluster model on the lattice @xmath23 with @xmath2 . * as a last example , we consider the complete graph . we give a simple construction of the coalescent process on the complete graph and we deduce a construction of a coalescent process on the interval @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "letting the size of the graph increase to @xmath21 , we determine the asymptotic distribution of the coalescence time : it appears to be essentially the same as in the erds - rnyi random graph model ( see @xcite ) though the lack of independence makes the proof significantly more difficult .",
