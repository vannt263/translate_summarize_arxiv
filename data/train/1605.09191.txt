    "in particle physics models with local super symmetry  ( susy ) or supergravity , one of the most important predictions is the existing of gravitino , which is the superpartner of graviton and has a spin 3/2 .",
    "the gravitino mass @xmath0 is related to the energy scales of susy breaking , and can vary from an order of ev up to of tev . in particular , scenarios with light gravitino",
    "whose mass is @xmath1  ev are very interesting because they are free from the cosmological gravitino problem  @xcite , and can be consistent with some baryogenesis scenarios which require a high reheating temperature such as thermal leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the scenarios with the light gravitino are very attractive in cosmology .",
    "it is important to determine the gravitino mass in order to understand the mechanism of susy breaking .",
    "although it can be probed by collider experiments  ( e.g. lhc )  @xcite with direct and indirect signatures , we can also obtain constraints on it from cosmological observations  @xcite . in the early universe ,",
    "light gravitinos are produced from thermal plasma , and they behave as warm dark matter  ( wdm ) at late epochs .",
    "the light gravitinos influence the growth of density fluctuations mainly through the following two effects .",
    "first of all , they change the time of matter - radiation equality because the light gravitinos behave as a radiation component at early epochs .",
    "secondly , the light gravitinos have large velocity dispersions and propagate up to the horizon scales until they become non-relativistic.then , they erase their own density fluctuation and suppress the growth of density fluctuations of matter below the free - streaming scale . however , the former effect is very small because the energy density of light gravitinos does not have a large fraction of the total energy of radiation .",
    "therefore , we can probe signatures of the light gravitino mainly through the latter effect . from lyman-@xmath12 forest data in combination with wmap @xcite",
    ", a constraint on the light gravitino mass is obtained , and its bound is @xmath13  ev ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "additionally , some authors have pointed out that measurements of cmb lensing  @xcite or weak lensing surveys of galaxies  @xcite are quite effective in constraining the light gravitino mass . by using the date of cmb lensing from planck and cosmic shear from the chftlens survey",
    ", a stringent constraint is obtained , and the upper bound is @xmath14  ev ( 95% c.l . )  @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to obtain significant bounds of the light gravitino mass if we treat the effective number of neutrino species for light gravitino @xmath15 as a free parameter , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the energy densities of light relativistic gravitinos and neutrinos , respectively .",
    "moreover , discriminating signatures of light gravitino from that of massive neutrino is also quite difficult .",
    "therefore , if one wants to discriminate light gravitinos from other possibilities , it is mandatory to find a new powerful probe of cosmological signatures of the light gravitino .    in this paper",
    ", we particularly investigate the issue of how accurately we can constrain the light gravitino mass by using future observations of fluctuations of neutral hydrogen 21 cm line which comes from the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , in addition to those of cmb . by observing the power spectrum of cosmological 21 cm line fluctuations , we will be able to obtain useful information on a variety of cosmological parameters @xcite . because observations of the 21 cm line can cover a wide redshift range , they can be complementary to other observations such as cmb .",
    "additionally , the effects of the light gravitino mainly appear on small scales , which can be well measured by 21 cm observations . in order to discuss expected constraints from the future cosmological surveys on the mass of light gravitino",
    ", we make fisher analysis by assuming the specifications for planned observations of 21 cm line such as square kilometre array ( ska ) @xcite and omniscope  @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we also take into account future cmb observations such as the simons array  @xcite and core+  @xcite . besides , we consider including information of a baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) observation , such as dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi ) @xcite and a direct measurement of the hubble constant @xmath7 .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : light - gravi ] , we briefly review the effects of light gravitino on cosmology . in section  [ sec : methods ] , we review analytical methods used in this paper , paying particular attention to 21 cm line , cmb , bao observations and the direct measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "we show our results in section  [ sec : results ] , and section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusion .",
    "the existence of light gravitino is typically predicted in gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) scenarios @xcite .",
    "susy breaking is the origin of the masses of the gravitino and susy particles . the susy breaking field @xmath18 has a vacuum expectation value as @xmath19 , and @xmath20 gives susy breaking scale , which is related to the gravitino mass @xmath0 .",
    "the gravitino mass is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "on the other hand , in gmsb scenarios , sparticles in the standard model  ( sm ) sector acquire their masses through messenger fields , whose mass scale is denoted as @xmath23 . for example , in a gmsb model with @xmath24 pairs of messenger particles , gaugino masses @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is a gauge group index ) and sfermion masses squared @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is a flavor index ) are typically given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is casimir operators for the sfermion @xmath31 , and @xmath32 denotes the gauge coupling constants . although @xmath33  tev is required in order to obtain tev scale masses , still the susy breaking scale @xmath20 or the gravitino mass @xmath0 can take a wide range of values as @xmath34 , where the upper bound comes from the requirement that the gravity - mediation does not dominate , and existence of the lower bound arises from avoiding destabilization of the messenger scalar and not leading to unwanted vacua .    in the gmsb models ,",
    "stringent constraints on the gravitino mass are obtained from the higgs mass measured by lhc  @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the stop mass is required to be as large as @xmath35  tev in order to achieve the measured large higgs mass @xmath36  gev , and the bound can place a lower bound on the gravitino mass . in a class of gmsb models with @xmath24 copies of messenger fields in the @xmath37 representation of su(5 ) , we can obtain a bound @xmath38 with @xmath39 , and @xmath40 with @xmath41  @xcite , if the coupling between the messengers and the susy breaking field is perturbative .",
    "although a range of the light gravitino mass which is allowed by present cosmological observations are ruled out , the bound by the lhc is model - dependent .",
    "for example , @xmath42  ev may be possible if the coupling is non - perturbative or a singlet higgs is introduced ( next to mssm ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , less stringent lower bounds are obtained from direct susy searches in lhc  @xcite . assuming a perturbative coupling , we can obtain a lower bound @xmath43 in the same gmsb model as mentioned above with @xmath44  tev and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 of su(5 ) ) .",
    "if we take account of the presence of the light gravitino in the early universe , some difficulties arise in constructing a consistent cosmological scenarios , which we are going to describe shortly below . at the reheating era , gravitinos",
    "are efficiently produced and the abundance of them can easily exceed that of the present dark matter unless the reheating temperature @xmath47 is very low  @xcite .",
    "however , many known baryogenesis / leptogenesis scenarios require high enough reheating temperature , which may be inconsistent with the upper bound coming from the observed abundance of dark matter .",
    "for example , thermal leptogenesis scenario  @xcite requires @xmath48  gev and the reheating temperature seems to conflict with the gravitino problem except for the very light gravitino mass range @xmath49  ev . if gravitinos have such a small mass , they are thermalized in the early universe  @xcite . in that case",
    ", their abundance does not have dependency on the reheating temperature and is smaller than the dark matter density if @xmath49  ev .",
    "this advantage is the reason why we particularly focus on the light gravitino scenario .",
    "thermally produced gravitinos decouple from the other particles at some point , and their relic abundance is fixed .",
    "the number density is determined by the effective degrees of freedom @xmath50 at the decoupling of the gravitinos . in @xcite , the number density of the gravitinos in gmsb models",
    "is evaluated by solving the boltzmann equation , and for a messenger mass scale @xmath51  tev , @xmath50 becomes @xmath52  @xcite with only mild dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "in consideration of the result , we set @xmath53 as the fiducial value in our analysis .",
    "the thermally produced light gravitinos behave as a warm dark matter component  @xcite , and they can be parametrized by their temperature and mass . since gravitinos interact with other particles through their goldstino components in the gmsb scenario , their phase - space distribution is a fermi - dirac distribution with two degrees of freedom . because light gravitinos behave as relativistic particles at early epoch , we can parametrize its energy density @xmath16 by using the effective number of neutrino species , and it is given by @xmath54 where @xmath17 is the energy density of one generation of neutrinos , and @xmath50 and @xmath55 are the effective degrees of freedom at decoupling of light gravitinos and neutrinos , respectively . in standard cosmology , the degree of freedom of neutrinos at the neutrino decoupling is @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are temperatures of light gravitinos and neutrinos , respectively . from eq .",
    ", the temperature of light gravitino at present is evaluated as @xmath59 where we use the temperature of neutrinos in the standard cosmology .    at late epochs ,",
    "light gravitinos lose their energy and become non - relativistic particles due to the cosmic expansion .",
    "its present density parameter @xmath60 can be estimated as @xmath61 in the following , we assume that dark matter does not consists solely of the light gravitinos because the gravitino mass @xmath0 needs to be about 90 ev in order to be consistent with observed dark matter density @xmath62  @xcite , which contradicts with the constraint from ly-@xmath12 forest , @xmath13  ev  @xcite , as well as a more recent one @xmath14  ev from cmb and cosmic shear data  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that dark matter consists of the light gravitino and cdm components .",
    "i.e. @xmath63 , and we define the fraction of gravitino in the total dark matter density as @xmath64 as the cdm component , the qcd axion , a messenger baryon proposed in  @xcite and so on can be well - fitted within the framework of the gmsb scenario .    from now on ,",
    "we briefly explain effects of the light gravitinos on cosmological structure formation .",
    "they behave as a warm dark matter component , and their effects on structure formation can be understood by considering the following two aspects : ( i ) a contribution to the energy density of radiation ( ii ) suppression of matter fluctuations on small scales through the free - streaming .",
    "the first effect is due to the fact that light gravitinos behave as relativistic particles at early epochs .",
    "therefore , the time of matter - radiation equality is slightly delayed if light gravitinos exist in the universe .",
    "the delay alters the evolution of gravitational potential and drives the integrated sachs - wolfe  ( isw ) effect in the cmb temperature anisotropy .",
    "in addition , the matter fluctuations are suppressed at small scales through stagspansion effect due to the delaying of matter - radiation equality .",
    "however , its contribution is so small ( as we mentioned before , the theoretical calculation predicts that @xmath50 is around 90 , which corresponds to @xmath65  @xcite ) , and it is difficult to measure the impacts due to this effect by observing cmb anisotropies without lensing .",
    "therefore , constraints on the gravitino mass mainly come from the second effect , i.e. its free - streaming behavior .",
    "because light gravitinos have relatively large thermal velocity , they propagate up to their free - streaming scale and erase own density fluctuation in a similar manner to massive neutrinos . within the free - streaming scale , light gravitinos do not contribute to the gravitational growth of the matter fluctuations .",
    "thus , matter fluctuations at small scales are suppressed in comparison to the @xmath66cdm model .",
    "massive neutrinos also have similar effects on the growth of matter fluctuations , but its temperature and energy density are different from those of light gravitinos . therefore , in principle , we can discriminate between the effects of the light gravitino and the massive neutrino through observing their free streaming scale .",
    "here , we briefly review a forecasting method related to 21 cm line observations in our analysis . for further details of the 21 cm line observations , we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen atom is emitted by transition between the hyperfine splitting of the 1s ground state .",
    "we can observe signals of 21 cm line which come from the epoch of reionization  ( eor ) or the cosmic dark ages as the differential brightness temperature relative to the temperature of cmb @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the comoving coordinates of the source of 21 cm line , @xmath70 represents the redshift at emission / absorption , @xmath71 is the spontaneous decay rate of the hyperfine splitting , @xmath72 ghz is the frequency of 21 cm line , @xmath73 is the number density of hydrogen , @xmath74 is the fraction of neutral hydrogen , and @xmath75 is the gradient of peculiar velocity along the line of sight .",
    "@xmath76 is the spin temperature , which is defined by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the number densities of singlet and triplet states of neutral hydrogen atom , respectively .",
    "here @xmath80 is the temperature corresponding to 21 cm line , and @xmath81 is its wavelength .    in this paper , we assume that @xmath82 because we focus on the epoch of reionization during which this condition is well satisfied . in general",
    ", the brightness temperature is sensitive to details of inter - galactic medium ( igm ) and astrophysical processes .",
    "however , with a few reasonable assumptions , we can eliminate the dependence from the 21 cm line brightness temperature  @xcite . at the epoch of reionization",
    "long after star formation begins , x - ray background produced by early stellar remnants heats the igm .",
    "therefore , kinetic temperature of the igm @xmath83 becomes much higher than that of cmb @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , the star formation produces a large amount of ly@xmath12 photons sufficient to couple @xmath85 to @xmath83 through the wouthuysen - field effect  @xcite . in this scenario , @xmath86",
    "are justified at @xmath87 , and @xmath88 does not depend on @xmath85 .",
    "now , let us consider fluctuations of the differential brightness temperature of 21 cm line @xmath89 .",
    "by expanding the hydrogen number density @xmath90 and the ionization fraction @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) as @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we can rewrite eq .   as @xmath95 where we assume that @xmath96 and neglect the term including the spin temperature . here",
