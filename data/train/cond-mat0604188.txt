    "the @xmath1 intermetallics , where a metal , m , is combined with f , one of the three ferromagnetic transition metals iron , nickel , or cobalt , for x close to 0.5 or 0.75 , provide some of the best known examples of the importance of chemical ordering as determinants of structure : property relationships .",
    "when crystallographically disordered by being prepared as , e.g. , thin films deposited on low temperature substrates , they are paramagnetic and cubic . however , when they are allowed to develop their most stable structures by preparing or annealing them at higher temperatures , the different elements order as homogeneous layers occupying the [ 100 ] planes that alternate with each other according to the overall stoichiometry of the material .",
    "they are then commonly referred to as @xmath0 alloys because the different sizes of their constituent elements as well as the chemical ordering results in a tetragonal distortion perpendicular to the layers .",
    "the proximity and periodicity of the atoms now cause the spins on the atoms of the fm metal to order first within a layer and next between the neighboring layers so that the @xmath0 alloys are ferro or antiferromagnets , with the magnetization also along the tetragonal axis . of obvious interest",
    "are the intermediate regime between the fully disordered and ordered materials , the path connecting them , and the relationship between the partial structural spin ordering .    in the case of ni@xmath2mn@xmath3 alloy films near the equiatomic composition @xmath4 , the magnetic and structural properties have generated interest both from the basic and applied viewpoints .",
    "such films exhibit the aforementioned @xmath0 tetragonal phase which comprises alternating atomic planes of ni and mn along the @xmath5-axis with a contraction perpendicular to these planes . in its",
    "chemically ordered state , nimn is a strong antiferromagnet , which makes it a good candidate for use as the exchange coupling material to pin the reference ferromagnetic layer in spin valve magnetic read sensors.@xcite chemically ordered nimn is capable of providing strong pinning fields , a high blocking temperature , and good corrosion resistance.@xcite    it has been shown that the exchange bias in nimn alloys decreases with decreasing antiferromagnet layer thickness and that a critical thickness is needed to develop the exchange coupling .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that such thin films ( @xmath6 nm ) are not chemically ordered and hence are not antiferromagnetic , which explains the small exchange coupling in these films . in grazing incidence",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements up to @xmath7 @xmath8 on nimn films annealed at @xmath9 c over this range of thicknesses , no traces of sites were found . in @xmath10 nm",
    "thick films , the chemically ordered @xmath0 phase grows at the expense of the fcc phase , increasing the exchange bias to @xmath11 oe .",
    "an intriguing aspect of these @xmath1 intermetallics is that the onset of magnetization occurs prior to the observation of chemical ordering / tetragonal distortion .",
    "this behavior suggests that the spins can align in magnetic domains that are at or below the size of structural domains that would give signatures in diffraction , i.e. , the diffraction limit .",
    "local structure measurements on ptco , ptfe , and nimn have in fact demonstrated a correlation between this initial magnetization and ordering on local length - scales.@xcite it is notable that a very high degree of local ordering was observed in these studies that suggests the materials are actually composed of incoherent nanoscale domains that are close to the homogeneous @xmath0 structure .",
    "xafs studies provide complementary information not only to diffraction data , which gives the long - range average order , but also to that obtained from diffuse scattering and pair distribution analysis , providing an alternative means for probing the development of the nucleation sites for the @xmath0 phase.@xcite indeed , xafs has been employed at the mn _",
    "k_-edge as a direct and element specific probe of the average local atomic structure within @xmath12  of the mn site , in which a short - range order parameter is introduced to quantify and confirm the presence of @xmath0 structures.@xcite at low annealing temperatures , the short - range order parameter differs from an associated long - range order parameter obtained from diffraction data , providing a sufficient condition for nanoscale phase separation and heterogeneity by demonstrating the presence of a nondiffracting but locally ordered component within the alloy . in these films",
    "a nonzero coercivity is measured even while the associated diffraction patterns exhibit no signs of an @xmath0 structure .",
    "when correlations between local distortions produce ordered distributions , they are generally observed in diffraction experiments as superlattice or satellite peaks ( in addition to the bragg peaks).@xcite the situation , however , is more complicated when domains below the limit of long - range order occur in a random or aperiodic distribution.@xcite in this case , the effects of heterogeneity , defect or other chemical organization , and competition between different phases on the diffraction patterns are not well understood . in garcia - adeva _",
    "et al._,@xcite for example , it has been shown that a second coexisting structure affecting one - fifth or more of the atoms in various two dimensional lattices can have a minimal to negligible effect on the calculated structure factors when compared with their periodic counterparts .",
    "the signatures of disorder that are present in the diffuse part of the scattering are usually smooth and subtle , and it is often easy to construct several distinct disordered lattices that produce essentially equivalent diffraction patterns .    the indications of chemical ordering within very small domains of sizes that will average crystallographically to a random , cubic structure is not surprising .",
    "although even a random distribution of atoms may produce a plethora of semi - ordered domains containing up to several dozen atoms , given the stability of the layered structures in this system it is likely that when new atoms are deposited they add to existing structures in an ordered way that is terminated when the growing layered nanocrystallites collide . an alternative description might be to consider a random solid solution where each atom is allowed to exchange its position with a neighbor to form the more stable ordered structure only once , resulting in a large number of small domains that individually exhibit a high degree of order internally .",
    "because of the significance of this phenomenon whereby various properties have size thresholds for their expression in this and other systems , it is worth exploring their structural properties so as to understand the experimental signatures of nanoscale ordering in crystalline materials and the ramifications of ordered domains on stress and defect formation.@xcite    here , using the example of the nimn system , we investigate the effects that domain size and interface behavior have on conventional diffraction when nanoscale phase separation and heterogeneity either occur below such a diffraction limit , or are faced with the restriction of having coherent atoms across their respective interfaces in which long - range elastic strain prohibits their preferred structures from forming within the domains .",
    "we study the relevant length - scales in which chemical order can exist in the form of small nanoscale @xmath0 domains immersed in a chemically disordered matrix with an average , crystallographic structure , and quantify the domain sizes by which such distortions will not be apparent in the diffraction data and yet still resolvable with local probes .",
    "in addition , at this length - scale , we discuss the role that elastic stresses at the domain interfaces play in determining the relaxation field of the structure within the domains themselves , the energy considerations of such interfacial interactions , and the associated signatures such a strain has on the long - range ( e.g. diffraction ) and local ( e.g. xafs , pair distribution ) probes .",
    "the analytical and numerical analysis that follows will make use of the structure factor @xmath13 and pair distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath14 of various lattices to illustrate the effects of nanoscale heterogeneity on extended and local probe data , as the two functions are well - defined and computationally tractable .",
    "the formalism used is identical to peterson _",
    "et al._,@xcite with comparisons to other definitions and nomenclature found in keen @xcite .",
    "nanoscale heterogeneity and phase separation are not exclusive to the magnetic alloy considered in here .",
    "this is also the case , for example , with substitutional impurities in solid solutions.@xcite if the impurity atoms attract or repel each other , heterogeneous nanoscale domains or texture will form in the solid .",
    "likewise , these effects are seen in charge separation and charge ordering in colossal magnetoresistance compounds and high @xmath15 superconductors , leading to the formation of stripes.@xcite",
    "a random arrangement of atoms will exhibit chemical ordering on all length - scales , with more ordering appearing more often at smaller , nanoscale lengths .",
    "in addition , a growth process might favor the formation of such domains beyond their intrinsic random existence , if the energetics permits .",
    "the growth of layers during atom deposition , or neighbor exchange on a surface , are examples mentioned before .     that attains some critical value within the cores of ordered domains.,width=288 ]    in the case of the @xmath0 ordering just described , one might define a region , or domain , of such ordering if more than 3/4 of the atoms satisfy the definition of @xmath0 ordering , with alternating rows of distinct atoms .",
    "figure [ random_ab ] shows a two dimensional example of this , in which equal numbers of red and blue atoms are distributed randomly .",
    "rectangular regions are demarcated if their enclosed atoms show such ordering , and the parallel lines within the domains show the @xmath0 orientation . using these rules , it is seen that roughly @xmath16 of the atoms are found in such layered - type domains . with this",
    ", one can define an order parameter @xmath17 that has a value of zero in locations where no @xmath0 ordering is present , a value of one within domains exhibiting @xmath0 ordering , and a value of one - half at the interfaces .",

    "[ random_ab ] shows a plot of @xmath18 across the middle horizontal row of atoms , in which the ordering is high ( solid line ) , and a horizontal row from a lower portion of atoms , in which the ordering is low ( dashed line ) , along with values of the average ordering @xmath19 and a hypothetical critical value @xmath20 .",
    "when the ordering is above the critical value , the structure takes on a function , in this case antiferromagnetism .",
    "recent calculations of local electronic density of states in nimn do in fact show that the perturbation on the spin ordering from the inhomogeneity at the interface is spatially confined.@xcite the plot shows that indeed certain regions attain this value , despite the random arrangement of atoms .",
    "the majority of ordering will exist at the nanoscale , and hereafter we set out to determine the signatures that such ordering exhibit in extended and local probes .",
    "our treatment of the fcc-@xmath0 phase coexistence in nimn alloys will mostly involve cases in which the two structures are present in equal amounts , and we consider the case of total @xmath0 ordering for completeness .",
    "we have found that the degree of atomic correlation at the interfaces of domains plays a critical role in determining the actual crystallographic structure within the domains . in the case where there is no correlation whatsoever between the orientation and placement of one domain with respect to another ,",
    "then it is an excellent approximation to assume that the internal structure of the domain is identical to that of an associated infinite crystal ( that is , it is `` ideal '' ) .",
    "small distortions at the interfaces contribute insignificant signatures to @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    for small domain sizes ,",
    "the structure within the domains can be close to ideal if one allows for dislocations at the interface between the domain and the matrix it is embedded within .",
    "dislocations serve to localize the large elastic energy present in any system containing two or more phases with different lattice parameters between them . without dislocations , the internal structures of the domains and the matrix would be far from ideal , exhibiting a continuous strain throughout such that the structure remains coherent at the interfaces",

    "the fcc structure has a higher symmetry chemically disordered phase in which the average bond length between any two neighbor atoms is constant .",
    "the lattice mismatch between the structures is accounted for locally by the presence of a dislocation , shown in the inset .",
    "although the dislocation introduces a large distortion locally in the lattice , distant atoms are able to take on their preferred arrangement , even at the interface of the @xmath0 and fcc domains .",

    "[ nimn_2d ] depicts an arrangement of hexagonal domains with complete @xmath0 ordering , in which no dislocations are allowed .",
    "the resulting stress on the atoms induces a strain that propagates throughout the domains , as depicted in the inset .",
    "the length - scale over which the strain extends tends to alter the unique tetragonal structures that are otherwise present in the case of the rectangular domains that allow for dislocations .",
    "we will see that such an arrangement of domains , and the accompanying strain , can actually produce a structure with an increased tetragonal distortion , albeit highly disordered .",
    "it is useful to consider whether the presence of dislocations , which localize the large elastic energy around a core of atoms while allowing a minimum elastic energy configuration elsewhere , is energetically favorable over the case of an identical distribution of domains without dislocations .",
    "the latter scenario tends to uniformly distribute the elastic energy throughout a large region near the interfaces .",

    "the rectangular domain size is characterized by the average number of atoms @xmath21 per side .",
    "clearly , it becomes more favorable to have uncorrelated domains coexisting within the two dimensional structure as the average domain size increases .",
    "for @xmath22 , however , dislocations at the interfaces introduce more elastic energy per atom than highly correlated structures in which the strain is uniformly distributed throughout the interior of the domains . in this case , the lattice mismatch between the @xmath0 and fcc structures is too small to be accounted for by the addition or subtraction of one dislocation row .",
    "this analysis of a two dimensional system motivates one to consider both scenarios . clearly , correlated domain distributions are favorable when the domain size is small , and we will investigate their effects on @xmath13 and @xmath14 for various domain sizes . in this case",
    "energetics plays an important role , and the atom positions ( and the ensuing long - range strain ) must be carefully accounted for with a robust numerical model . in the next section , however , we consider the case in which spherical domains of ideal @xmath0 and fcc structures coexist in a three dimensional structure . by incorporating the reasonable approximation that the domains are entirely uncorrelated with each other , through the presence of dislocations or otherwise , we quantitatively obtain their diffraction and pdf signatures with little analytical effort , and without any need for large - scale numerical treatments .",
    "the radially averaged structure factor , @xmath13 , of a nimn alloy with uncorrelated fcc and @xmath0 spherical domains can be derived analytically with very little approximation needed . consider a nimn alloy in which the fcc domains have an internal structure defined by a unit cell with lattice parameter @xmath23  , and the @xmath0 tetragonal domains have an internal structure defined by a unit cell with @xmath24  and @xmath25 .@xcite the atomic densities of the two internal structures are equal within @xmath26 .",

    "the peaks then become `` shoulders '' of their neighboring fcc peaks , and are still distinguishable because of changes in the local curvature of the structure factor between the two peak locations ( i.e. , an inflection point still resides between them ) .",

    "[ gr_c ] ) , which suggests a description of the structure as a mesoscale glass with medium - range order . additionally , the peak positions , when resolvable , are shifted from the @xmath0 tetragonal structure so much that one can only conclude that some collective behavior among the domains is present , which we alluded to earlier with respect to their structure factors .",
    "when there is only one average structure present throughout the crystal , such as the case with correlated rectangular domains of @xmath0 chemical ordering comprising half the structure , then local and extended probes reveal the same structure .",
    "then , in the context of the nimn alloy considered here , magnetic order is probably more correlated with the @xmath0 chemical ordering than the tetragonal distortions .",
    "we have provided conclusive evidence , both analytically and numerically , that it is indeed possible to have well - defined tetragonal distortions within localized domains that fall below the diffraction limit .",
    "the structure is therefore readily attainable via local probes such as xafs .",
    "an analytical treatment considered the phase coexistence of such structures with a chemically disordered fcc structure , where the two structures are entirely uncorrelated .",
    "basic diffraction analysis predicts with great accuracy the domain size below which the tetragonal signatures are no longer present in unique bragg peaks , but instead become part of the diffuse scattering of the average fcc structure .    in the case in which atomic coherence is maintained across the interfaces of domains , numerical treatments incorporating elastic energy considerations",
    "indicate that the tetragonal structure may only manifest itself far away from the interfaces , but the domain sizes considered in this treatment never allowed for true fcc and tetragonal phase separation . instead",
    ", the strain incurred by the competing domains is of such great extent as to produce even larger tetragonal distortions than the pair interaction potentials dictate , as well as significant disorder indicative of mesoscale glassy materials ( seen in the 100% @xmath0 ordered hexagonal domains ) .",
    "alternatively , it has a tendency to average the structure to an fcc phase ( as in the case of 50% @xmath0 ordered rectangular domains ) .",
    "if the latter case is indeed the correct description of the nanoscale ordering of nimn alloys , then one must conclude that the presence of antiferromagnetism is a direct result of the chemical ordering present in the @xmath0 structure , and not the actual tetragonal distortion since this is suppressed .",
