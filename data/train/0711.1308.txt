    "the ground states of atomic nuclei are characterized by different equilibrium configurations which correspond to different geometrical shapes .",
    "the study of these equilibrium shapes , as well as the transition regions between them , has been the subject of a large number of theoretical and experimental studies ( for a review , see , for example , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .    within the framework of algebraic models ,",
    "the different nuclear phase shapes are put in correspondence to dynamic symmetries of some algebraic structure that links a specific mathematical symmetry with a specific nuclear shape .",
    "dynamic symmetries provide a useful tool to describe properties of different physical systems since they lead to exactly solvable problems and produce all results for observables in explicit analytic form .    in nuclear physics , the algebraic structure of relevance , according to the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite ,",
    "is given by u(6 ) .",
    "there are three dynamical symmetries characterized by u(5 ) , associated to spherical symmetry , su(3 ) , associated with axially deformed symmetry , and so(6 ) , describing @xmath0-unstable shapes .",
    "experimental examples of all three types of symmetries have been recognized in many nuclei .",
    "the phase shape transitions correspond to the breaking of these dynamic symmetries and they occur as the number of nucleons change in the nucleus . understanding the behavior of systems undergoing a phase transition is of especial relevance , since a complicated interplay of competing degrees of freedom occurs at the critical points .",
    "iachello @xcite introduced the e(5 ) and x(5 ) critical point symmetries within the framework of the collective bohr hamiltonian @xcite under some simplifying approximations .",
    "critical point symmetries provide parameter free ( up to scale factors ) predictions of excitation spectra and electric quadrupole b(e2 ) strengths for nuclei at the critical point of a phase / shape transition .",
    "the geometrical shape of the ground state can be described @xcite by three euler angles and by the quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 . at the critical point of the phase transition the potential in the @xmath1 degree of freedom can be approximated by a simple square well potential , which is decoupled from the potential in the @xmath0-variable . in the case of the e(5 ) critical point symmetry , which corresponds to the transition from spherical vibrational u(5 ) to deformed @xmath0-unstable o(6 ) , the potential is flat in the @xmath0-direction . in the case of the symmetry x(5 ) ,",
    "related to the transition from u(5 ) to axially symmetric prolate su(3 ) , a harmonic oscillator potential is used in the @xmath0-direction .",
    "empirical evidence of these transitional symmetries at the critical points were soon found in @xmath2ba @xcite for e(5 ) and in @xmath3sm @xcite for x(5 ) .",
    "other nuclei have been also identified as good candidates for those symmetries .",
    "such is the case of @xmath4pd @xcite , and @xmath5xe @xcite , which provide examples of e(5 ) symmetry .",
    "other n=90 isotones like @xmath6nd @xcite , @xmath7gd @xcite , and @xmath8dy @xcite also provide examples of x(5 ) symmetry .",
    "algebraic models are very suitable for systematic studies because they provide powerful predictions with a very small number of parameters , but in order to deepen into the details , one has to perform microscopic investigations of shape transitions and critical points which are , to a large extent , still missing .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to examine whether the assumptions of relatively flat potentials in e(5 ) and x(5 ) are justified in different microscopic models and the self - consistent mean - field approximation , based on parametrizations widely used all over the nuclear chart , appears as a very attractive initial tool for a link between algebraic models and microscopic theories . in this context , the relativistic mean - field framework has been employed , in calculations of pecs as functions of the quadrupole deformation @xcite .",
    "these studies have been performed for isotopic chains in which the occurrence of critical point symmetries has been predicted . since flat pecs are one of the expected characteristics of critical point symmetries , constrained calculations in those isotopic chains should result in relatively flat pecs for nuclei with the critical symmetry .",
    "it has been shown that particular isotopes exhibit relatively flat pecs over an extended range of the deformation parameter . nevertheless , the behavior of the pecs , and particularly the potential barriers , are quite sensitive to the relativistic interaction used @xcite , as well as to the pairing treatment .",
    "therefore , the question arises whether a similar situation occurs when using nonrelativistic effective interactions to study candidates for critical point symmetries .",
    "such systematic nonrelativistic studies are still missing and it is very interesting to compare the conclusions extracted from them with those obtained using both algebraic models and relativistic mean - field approximations .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the calculations mentioned above to the case of nonrelativistic self - consistent skyrme hartree - fock + bcs mean - field calculations .",
    "the shape phase transitions corresponding to e(5 ) and x(5 ) symmetries are investigated systematically in various isotopic chains containing some of the suggested critical nuclei .",
    "in particular we study pd , xe , and ba isotopic chains as candidates to e(5 ) symmetry , and nd , sm , gd , and dy isotopic chains as examples of x(5 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ t - framewok ] we present a brief description of the theoretical formalism ( hartree - fock + bcs ) used to obtain the main ingredient of the present study , i.e. , the pecs for the considered isotopic chains . for a more detailed account",
    "the reader is referred to the corresponding literature .",
    "[ results ] contains our results with a discussion on the sensitivity of the pecs to the effective nucleon - nucleon force and to the treatment of the pairing correlations .",
    "[ conclusions ] is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "the microscopic approach used in this work ( i.e. , hf+bcs ) is based on a self - consistent formalism built on a deformed hartree - fock ( hf ) mean - field , using skyrme type energy density functionals . pairing correlations between like nucleons",
    "are included in the bcs approximation .",
    "it is well known that the density - dependent hf+bcs approximation provides a very good description of ground - state properties for both spherical and deformed nuclei @xcite and it is at present one of the state - of - the - art mean - field descriptions @xcite .",
    "there are two leading choices of methods to solve the deformed hf+bcs equations .",
    "one option is the use of a coordinate space mesh . in this case one solves the hf+bcs equations for skyrme type functionals via discretization of the individual wave functions on a 3-dimensional cartesian mesh @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an expansion on a specific basis of lagrange polynomials associated with the selected mesh .",
    "the other common choice is to expand the single particle wave functions into an appropriate orthogonal basis ( commonly the eigenfunctions of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator potential ) . in the present study",
    "we perform calculations with both methods .",
    "we use the code * ev8 * @xcite in the first case and follow the procedure based on the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the second case .    in this work",
    "we consider the parametrization sly4 @xcite of the skyrme force in the particle - hole channel , although we also show results in some instances for the forces sk3 @xcite and sg2 @xcite .",
    "they are examples of global effective interactions of skyrme - type that have been designed to fit ground state properties of spherical nuclei and nuclear matter properties . while sk3 is the most simple one , involving in particular a linear dependence on the density , sly4 is one of the most recent parametrizations of skyrme forces .",
    "as we move away from closed shells , pairing correlations play an important role @xcite and should be taken into account . if one were dealing with a fundamental many - body hamiltonian , one would proceed to apply hartree - fock - bogoliubov formalism to it . however , dealing with skyrme forces that have been simplified with the aim of reproducing average or bulk properties of the nucleus , one would have to include additional parameters in order to guarantee that sensible pairing matrix elements are obtained @xcite .                in this study pairing correlations are taken into account in the bcs approximation .",
    "several options have been investigated .",
    "our main option will be the use of a zero - range density - dependent pairing force @xcite ,    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the spin exchange operator , @xmath11 is the nuclear density , and @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "the strength @xmath14 of the pairing force [ eq.([dd - pairing ] ) ] is taken @xmath15 mev-@xmath16 for both neutrons and protons and a smooth cut - off of 5 mev around the fermi level has also been used .",
    "let us mention that very recently the parametrization sly4 has been successfully applied in combination with the pairing interaction [ eq.([dd - pairing ] ) ] ( with @xmath15 mev-@xmath16 ) in systematic studies of correlation energies from @xmath17o to the superheavies @xcite and in global studies of spectroscopic properties of the first @xmath18 states in even - even nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is the main reason for selecting the combination sly4 in the particle - hole channel and the interaction [ eq .",
    "( [ dd - pairing ] ) ] ( with @xmath15 mev-@xmath16 ) in the pairing channel as the leading choice for the present study .",
    "additionally , results with the strength @xmath19",
    "mev-@xmath16 will also be shown in some cases .",
    "another common practice to include pairing correlations is to introduce a schematic seniority pairing force with a constant pairing strength @xmath20 @xcite , we call this treatment constant - force approach ,    @xmath21    the strength of the pairing force for protons and neutrons @xmath22 is chosen in such a way that the experimental pairing gaps extracted from binding energies in neighboring nuclei are reproduced .",
    "one can further simplify the pairing treatment by parametrizing the pairing gaps @xmath23 directly from experiment , we call this treatment constant - gap approach .",
    "the pairing strength and pairing gap are related through the gap equation @xcite    @xmath24    where @xmath25 are the occupation amplitudes .",
    "the pecs shown in this study are computed microscopically by constrained hf+bcs calculations @xcite .",
    "these pecs are obtained by minimizing the corresponding energy functional under a quadratic constraint that holds the nuclear quadrupole moment fixed to a given value . in this work",
    "we show the energies as a function of the ( axially symmetric ) mass quadrupole moment @xmath26 , which is related with the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath27 by the expression @xmath28 in terms of the mean square radius of the mass distribution @xmath29",
    ". tables i and ii contain the quadrupole parameters @xmath27 corresponding to the equilibrium configurations for the isotopes considered in this work .",

    "it is known that pecs are sensitive to the effective nuclear force in both relativistic @xcite and nonrelativistic @xcite approaches , as well as to pairing correlations @xcite .",

    "we perform this study on the example of @xmath30xe and @xmath3sm , which are proposed candidates for e(5 ) and x(5 ) symmetries , respectively .                in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we study the effect of using different methods of solving the hf+bcs equations , coordinate lattice @xcite and deformed harmonic oscillator basis @xcite . in these calculations",
    "we use the same sly4 force in the particle - hole channel and the same constant - gap treatment of pairing .",
    "the results indicate that the pecs obtained are practically the same in these two cases and in general in all the isotopes we have considered in this work .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we consider the pecs obtained from three different skyrme forces , namely sly4 , sg2 , and sk3 , using the same pairing treatment .",
    "we can see that the location of the oblate and prolate minima appear at the same deformation no matter what the force is . however , the relative energies of the minima and the energy barriers between the minima can change by a few mev , depending on the force .    in fig . [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the effect of pairing using sly4 force in all cases .",
    "we consider the constant - gap approach and the constant - force approach .",
    "again , we observe that the minima appear at about the same deformations but the energy barriers can change considerably depending on the approach used .    from the analysis of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we conclude that , at least in the mass region studied , the pecs are not sensitive to the method employed to solve the hf+bcs equations ( 3d cartesian lattice or deformed harmonic oscillator ) .",
    "we also conclude that the qualitative behavior of the energy profiles remains unchanged against changes in the skyrme and pairing interactions in the sense that the deformations at which the minima occur are rather stable",
    ". nevertheless , the relative energies of these minima , and particularly the energy barriers between them are very sensitive to the details of the calculation , especially to pairing .",

    "the main effect is a reduction of the energy barriers in the self - consistent treatment . in the case of nonrelativistic calculations with the gogny interaction ,",

    "one can see once more that oblate and prolate minima do not change significantly with the strength of pairing in each isotope .",
    "the only exceptions worth to mention are the cases @xmath34pd , @xmath35pd , and @xmath2xe , where we obtain the ground state at different deformations depending on the pairing strength @xmath14 .",
    "this happens because of the flatness of the corresponding pecs , but in any case the energy difference between the minima are always very small . on the other hand , the potential barriers are clearly lower when pairing is stronger .",
    "we can also observe the transition from the spherical isotopes @xmath34pd ( n=50 ) , @xmath36xe ( n=82 ) , and @xmath37ba ( n=82 ) to the @xmath0-unstable isotopes @xmath35pd , @xmath38xe , and @xmath39ba .",
