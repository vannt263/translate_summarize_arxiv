    "the study of @xmath0 bosons at different colliders serves as an important test of the standard model and its possible extensions .",

    "energy @xmath4 gev which is achieved by colliding electrons / positrons with energy @xmath5 gev and protons with energy @xmath6 gev .",
    "since the production cross sections for the processes @xmath7 reach values of about 1 @xmath8 at hera , the production mechanisms of @xmath0 bosons can be studied and the existence of anomalous @xmath9 trilinear couplings can be probed @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 boson production represents an important sm background to several new physics searches .",
    "in particular it is the dominant sm process leading to isolated high energy lepton events with missing transverse momentum @xcite . in order to determine potential discrepancies between measurements and standard model ( sm ) predictions , the latter have to be sufficiently accurate and reliable .",
    "this is not guaranteed for the available lo calculations of @xmath0 boson production ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . for an unambiguous test of anomalous contributions ,",
    "it is necessary to extend the previous analyses to nlo accuracy .",
    "the first step in this direction has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the qcd corrections to the total resolved photoproduction cross section have been determined .",
    "however , the result can not be used for @xmath0 boson production with large transverse momentum which is dominated by direct photoproduction . in the following",
    "we shall describe the qcd corrections to direct photoproduction which were published in ref .",
    "the procedure of implementing the qcd corrections in monte carlo programs by a reweighting method is described in ref .",
    "@xmath0 boson production at @xmath3 colliders is mediated by photon , @xmath10 and @xmath0 exchange between the electron / positron and the hadronic currents of the process . in general two phase - space regions",
    "are distinguished : the deep inelastic ( dis ) regime at large @xmath11 and the photoproduction regime at small @xmath11 , @xmath11 being the negative square of the transferred momentum from the electron / positron .",
    "details of the calculation of the photoproduction cross section are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the leading direct photon process @xmath12 develops a singularity at lo when the final state quark @xmath13 becomes collinear with the initial state photon . however , the finite transverse momentum @xmath14 of the @xmath0 boson has to be balanced by the final state quark , so that this singularity does not occur at lo for non - vanishing @xmath14 .",
    "the small @xmath11 region includes the contribution of the hadronic component of the photon giving rise to @xmath15 production via @xmath16 and the crossed processes @xmath17 .",
    "the treatment of the dis region is straightforward .",
    "the direct , resolved and dis contributions add up to the total @xmath14 distribution .",
    "direct photoproduction forms the dominant contribution , while the dis part is smaller but significant .",
    "the resolved component is negligible for @xmath18 $ \\sim$}}~}15 $ ] gev @xcite .",
    "the dependence on the specific value of the cut @xmath19 which separates the dis and photoproduction regimes is below the per - cent level @xcite and thus sufficiently small .",
    "for the dominant direct part we have evaluated the nlo qcd corrections .",
    "they consist of two parts , the virtual and real corrections .",
    "the virtual corrections are built up by all one - loop diagrams which are generated by virtual gluon exchange .",
    "they have been computed via dimensional regularization in @xmath20 dimensions .",
    "the quarks have been treated as massless particles .",
    "the real corrections which originate from gluon radiation off the quark lines and the corresponding crossed contributions with the gluon in the initial state have been calculated by means of the massless dipole subtraction method introduced in ref .",
    "they cancel the infrared and collinear divergences of the virtual corrections and the collinear singularity of the counter term due to the renormalization of the parton densities at nlo , respectively .",
    "the nlo parton densities have been defined in the @xmath21 scheme .",
    "this procedure allows to calculate the real matrix elements in 4 dimensions .",
    "we analyzed our final results for direct photoproduction of @xmath0 bosons plus one jet as well as the inclusive process @xmath22",
    ", i.e.  without defining jets .",
    "details of the jet requirements , our choice of parton density functions and values of the relevant numerical parameters can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    setting @xmath23 for the renormalization and factorization scales ,",
    "we present the final results for the @xmath14 distributions of @xmath22 production in fig .",
    "[ fg : pti ] ( a ) .",
    "the qcd corrections modify the direct contribution by about @xmath24 and are thus of moderate size . to estimate the theoretical uncertainties , the renormalization / factorization scale dependence of the direct contributions to the processes @xmath25",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fg : pti ] ( b ) for hera conditions .",
    "the scale dependence is significantly smaller , once the nlo corrections are included .",
    "the residual scale dependence is reduced from about 20% down to about 5% .",
    "fig.[fg : pti ] ( b ) clearly indicates that the nlo qcd corrections are accidentally small at the central scale determined by the @xmath0 boson mass .",
    "since the uncertainties of the parton densities are of similar size , the total theoretical uncertainty can be estimated to be less than about 10% .    -90",

    "we have presented predictions for @xmath0 boson production at hera including the qcd corrections to the dominant direct photon mechanism at finite transverse momentum of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "we find that the qcd corrections are of moderate size .",
    "however , the qcd corrections to the dis part are still unknown .",
    "they are not expected to be significantly larger , because they have to cancel the @xmath19 dependence of the nlo direct contribution and thus have to be of similar size .",
    "since the qcd corrections are dominated by soft gluon effects , the shapes of the differential distributions are hardly affected .",
    "therefore the results obtained in this work can not explain the excess of isolated high - energy lepton events observed at the h1 experiment @xcite",
