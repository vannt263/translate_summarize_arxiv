    "multiple - access channels ( macs ) and similar multi - sender channels with conferencing encoders have attracted attention recently due to the inclusion of base - station cooperation methods in standards for future wireless systems @xcite . the original conferencing protocol for the discrete memoryless mac is due to willems @xcite .",
    "the conferencing mac with imperfect channel state information was modeled as a compound mac with conferencing encoders and considered in @xcite , a different model for channel state uncertainty is given in @xcite .",
    "this paper covers a very high degree of channel uncertainty in macs : the channel states may vary arbitrarily over time .",
    "the task is to use coding to enable reliable communication for every possible state sequence .",
    "the corresponding information - theoretic channel model is the arbitrarily varying mac ( av - mac ) .",
    "the random coding capacity region of the av - mac without encoder cooperation was determined in @xcite .",
    "building on this result , the deterministic coding capacity region of some av - macs without cooperation was determined in @xcite . in general",
    ", it is still open .",
    "we will use the `` robustification '' and `` elimination of correlation '' techniques developed by ahlswede in @xcite , and partly already used in @xcite in a multi - user setting , in order to characterize both the deterministic and random coding capacity regions of any av - mac with conferencing encoders , i.e.  of any av - mac where encoding is done using a willems conference as in @xcite with at least one positive conferencing capacity .",
    "thus none of the techniques we apply in this paper is completely new , but in contrast to the non - conferencing situation , they allow for the complete solution of the problems considered here .",
    "the rather general `` robustification '' technique establishes the random coding capacity region of the av - mac with conferencing encoders .",
    "both single- and multi - user arbitrarily varying channels are special in that random coding as commonly used in information theory does not yield the same results as deterministic coding .",
    "this shows that common randomness shared at the senders and the receiver is an important additional resource .",
    "there is a dichotomy : either reliable communication at any non - zero rate pair is impossible with the application of deterministic codes , or the deterministic capacity region coincides with the random coding capacity region , which then is two - dimensional . in the latter case , one needs the non - standard `` elimination of correlation '' @xcite for derandomization .",
    "it is a two - step protocol which achieves the random coding capacity region if this is possible .",
    "the combination of the elimination technique with conferencing proves to be very fruitful .",
    "here lies the main difference between the av - mac with and without conferencing .",
    "one can show that there exist channels which only achieve the zero rate pair without transmitter cooperation , but where derandomization using the elimination technique is possible if the transmitters may have a conference .",
    "the reason for this is symmetrizability .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of an adversary knowing the channel input symbols and randomizing over the channel states .",
    "there are three kinds of symmetrizability for multiple - access channels .",
    "the capacity region of the av - mac without conferencing equals @xmath0 if all three symmetrizability conditions are satisfied .",
    "in contrast , the elimination of correlation technique works if the av - mac with willems conferencing encoders does not satisfy the conditions for the first of the three kinds of symmetrizabilities .",
    "the two others do not matter . by conferencing with at least one positive conferencing capacity , the av - mac gets closer to a single - sender arbitrarily varying channel where only one symmetrizability condition exists @xcite .",
    "this induced change of the channel structure is also reflected in the counter - intuitive fact that conferencing with rates tending to zero in blocklength can enlarge the capacity region .",
    "the adversary interpretation of symmetrizability highlights the importance of the av - mac for the theory of information - theoretic secrecy : if a channel is symmetrizable , an adversary can completely prevent communication .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section is devoted to the formalization of the channel model and the coding problems .",
    "we present the main theorems and several auxiliary coding results .",
    "the direct parts of the random and deterministic coding theorems are solved in section [ sect : ach ] .",
    "section [ sect : conv ] gives the converses of the random and deterministic av - mac coding theorems .",

    "lemma [ auxlem ] now implies that @xmath325 must hold .",
    "thus the proof of theorem [ thmconf ] is complete .",
    "the goal of this paper was to characterize the capacity region of an av - mac whose encoders may exchange limited information about their messages .",
    "this topic is motivated by the increasing interest of cooperative networks which are subject to exterior interference .",
    "for example , spectrum sharing has been discussed for inclusion into future wireless system standards .",
    "we saw above that the av - mac can be interpreted as a channel suffering from attacks by an adversary who may choose the state sequence given the channel inputs .",
    "the reliability requirements for av - macs are very strict  coding is done such that the average error is small for every possible state sequence .",
    "the resulting capacity region is the same as that for the conferencing compound mac determined by the convex hull of the set of channel matrices of the original av - mac _ if _ the latter is not @xmath134-symmetrizable",
    ". otherwise the av - mac is useless .",
    "in contrast , for av - macs without conferencing , the complete characterization of the deterministic capacity region is still open .",
    "the dichotomy in the form of the deterministic capacity regions of arbitrarily varying multiple - access channels does not occur if random coding is used .",
    "however , using a random code requires both the senders and the receiver to have access to a common source of randomness .",
    "thus random coding is usually only used as a mathematical tool for finding good deterministic codes .",
    "it is well known that derandomization is no problem for compound channels ( including discrete memoryless channels as a special case )  this is nothing but the well - known `` random coding method '' .",
    "it builds on the fact that the finite number of channel states does not increase with blocklength .",
    "this is not so in the case of arbitrarily varying channels .",
    "the number of states _ per channel use _ remains constant , but the number of states per transmission of a codeword increases _ exponentially _ in blocklength .",
    "this is the reason why the deterministic capacity region of arbitrarily varying multiple - access channels may be strictly contained in the random coding capacity region .",
    "in fact , if derandomization is not possible , then no positive rates are achievable at all .",
    "in contrast to the derandomization technique used for simpler channels , ahlswede s elimination technique gives rise to a two - step protocol . in order to approximate a given achievable rate pair @xmath89 ,",
    "one only needs the constituent deterministic codes of a random code whose rate pair approximates @xmath89 .",
    "the randomness of the random code is used in the average error estimate .",
    "( on the other hand , this shows how much weaker the average error criterion is compared with the maximal error requirement  the randomized part can be `` hidden '' in the average error . )    it is noteworthy that for the arbitrarily varying multiple - access channel , the conferencing protocols needed to achieve any rate pair within the capacity region remain as simple as for the compound multiple - access channel with conferencing encoders .",
    "there are no iterative steps , so the implementation of such a conference is straightforward .",
    "finally we would like to analyze the benefits of willems conferencing .",
    "we compare the gains obtained in av - macs to the gains obtained in compound macs . for both compound and av - macs ,",
    "conferencing may help to achieve positive rates where only the rate pair @xmath326 is achievable without transmitter cooperation .",
    "this effect is similar to the `` superactivation '' of quantum channels as observed in @xcite , where it was shown that there are pairs of quantum channels with zero quantum capacity each which achieve positive rates when used together .",
    "every compound mac with conferencing capacities @xmath132 and @xmath327 has an at least one - dimensional capacity region .",
    "if is not satisfied , then the capacity region equals @xmath0 .",
    "no matter what dimension the corresponding @xmath164 has , the gains of conferencing are continuous in @xmath50 , in particular in @xmath328 .",
    "this is in contrast to the av - mac .",
    "the changes in in the deterministic capacity region @xmath92 are continuous in all @xmath329 with @xmath132 because either @xmath148 for all @xmath329 with @xmath132 or @xmath330 for all @xmath50",
    ". however , there may be a discontinuity in @xmath328 .",
    "this corresponds to the two roles conferencing plays in av - macs .",
    "the `` traditional '' role is to generate a common message and to use the coding result for the ( compound ) mac with common message to enlarge the capacity region . for av - macs ,",
    "it does even more  it changes the channel structure .",
    "recall remark [ subexpconf ] .",
    "for a conferencing rate pair with @xmath331 , the capacity region of the compound mac stays as it is . under the conditions that @xmath115 is not @xmath134-symmetrizable and @xmath332 , though",
    ", we can strictly enlarge the capacity region of the av - mac with this kind of conferencing .",
    "general conditions for @xmath332 to hold can not be given because an exact characterization of @xmath166 is generally unavailable .",
    "we certainly know by theorem [ ac_satz ] that if @xmath166 is two - dimensional , then @xmath170 . we can further say that if in addition to not being @xmath134-symmetrizable , @xmath115 is both @xmath11- and @xmath143-symmetrizable , then @xmath173 , again by theorem [ ac_satz ] .",
    "this is a situation where already the conferencing from remark [ subexpconf ] helps . with the same argumentation as in remark [ zweidim ]",
    "it can easily be seen that @xmath333 so @xmath164 is at least one - dimensional . thus there is a discontinuity in @xmath328 in this case .",
    "gubner @xcite has found the example of a @xmath28 which is both @xmath11- and @xmath143-symmetrizable , but not @xmath134-symmetrizable .",
    "let @xmath334 and @xmath335",
    ". for @xmath14 set @xmath336 where @xmath337 if @xmath338 and @xmath339 else .",
    "an equivalent description of this is @xmath340 gubner shows that @xmath28 is not @xmath134-symmetrizable , but that it is both @xmath11- and @xmath143-symmetrizable .",
    "thus this channel is useless if coding is done without conferencing , even though the interfering signal is only added to the sum of the transmitters signals  the reliable transmission of messages through the channel is completely prevented .",
    "this shows that even the structure of rather simple av - macs can be changed by conferencing so as to produce discontinuous jumps at @xmath328 .",

    "that means that we assume that @xmath345 this statement is equivalent to the fact that for every @xmath107 there is some @xmath108 such that one of the following inequalities holds : @xmath346    our goal is to mainly use arguments already known from the weak converse for deterministic coding , so that we can refer to @xcite . from the random code@xmath67",

    ", we can proceed as in @xcite .",
