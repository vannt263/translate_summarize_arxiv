    "the study of exoplanets has matured greatly in the past decade .",
    "the _ kepler _ survey has enriched the body of known exoplanets with thousands of newly discovered objects @xcite . meanwhile , the improved capabilities of both space- and ground - based telescopes have enabled the collection of high - precision photometry for the brightest of these planets .",
    "the majority of the observations carried out to date have focused on the class of gas giant planets known as hot jupiters , which typically have orbital periods of a few days and atmospheric temperatures ranging between 1000 and 3000  k. these planets are some of the most favorable targets for detailed study , as they have relatively frequent and deep eclipses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    by observing the secondary eclipse , which occurs when the planet passes behind its host star",
    ", we can deduce the shape of the planet s infrared emission spectrum and thereby study the properties of its dayside atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the strong thermal emission of hot jupiters makes them ideal targets for this type of analysis , and measurements of the secondary eclipse in multiple wavelength bands are commonly used to construct low - resolution emission spectra at infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by comparing these observations with theoretical atmospheric models",
    ", we can constrain the planet s atmospheric pressure - temperature profile , chemistry , albedo , and global circulation patterns ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "infrared secondary eclipses have been measured for more than fifty exoplanets to date , of which the majority were obtained using the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the telescope s cryogen was exhausted in 2009 , _ spitzer _",

    "hot jupiters on eccentric orbits are of particular interest for atmospheric studies .",
    "in contrast to hot jupiters that lie on circular orbits and are therefore likely tidally - locked , these eccentric bodies experience diurnal forcing due to their nonsynchronous rotation as well as significant variations in the incident stellar flux throughout an orbit , leading to time - variable atmospheric forcing @xcite .",
    "the response of the planet s atmosphere reflects a balance between the time - varying stellar irradiation , the gravity wave propagation timescale , and the radiative time scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these mechanisms can lead to thermal gradients in the planet s atmosphere , as well as temporal variations in those gradients . unlike the circular case",
    ", phase curve observations of eccentric exoplanets can not uniquely distinguish between flux variations due to the planet s rotation and variations due to the changing irradiation experienced by the planet .",
    "observations of the secondary eclipse ingress and egress break this degeneracy by providing a near - instantaneous picture of the planet s dayside temperature distribution .",
    "specifically , the apparent offset of the center of eclipse phase due to a zonally - advected hot spot @xcite , along with deviations in the eclipse light curve morphology from a uniform disk model during ingress and egress @xcite , can be used to construct a two - dimensional map of the planet s dayside brightness distribution and constrain important properties of the atmosphere .",
    "the only successful secondary eclipse mapping observation to date is of the circular hot jupiter hd 189733b and was carried out independently by @xcite and @xcite using the 8  @xmath0 m band on _",
    "spitzer_.    recent general circulation models for eccentric hot jupiters have shown that while the dayside atmospheric brightness of these planets may exhibit some spatial and temporal variability@xcite , the phase curves of these planets should be relatively constant from one orbit to the next @xcite .",
    "the presence or absence of long - term variability has important implications for atmospheric studies of these planets .",
    "it is common practice to combine data at different wavelengths from separate epochs years apart and assume that these data offer a consistent picture of the dayside emission spectrum . by comparing many individual secondary eclipse observations over a long time baseline",
    ", we can directly constrain the magnitude of orbit - to - orbit variations in the planet s atmospheric circulation .    in this paper , we analyze twelve secondary eclipse and two transit observations of the eccentric hot jupiter xo-3b obtained in _ spitzer _",

    "@xcite reported secondary eclipse depths for this planet in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 micron spitzer bands , but these data were taken in stellar mode and as a result have a lower cadence and precision than the now - standard staring mode observations . here , we present twelve additional secondary eclipse and two transit observations with a total baseline of almost three years .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the observations and methodology for extracting photometry are described in section  [ sec : obs ] . in section  [ sec : analysis ] , we present the best - fit eclipse parameters for individual secondary eclipse and transit observations as well as the combined eclipse light curve .",

    "in addition , we exclude the top ( 32nd ) row of pixels , since they have values that are consistently lower than those from the rest of the array . before binning the remaining pixel values and fitting a gaussian",
    ", we iteratively trim outlier values that are more than @xmath18 from the median value . after subtracting the best - fit sky background from the subarray images , we correct for transient `` hot pixels '' in each set of 64 images by comparing the intensity of each pixel to its median value .",

    ", we subtract our best - fit model light curve from each photometric time series and compute the rms scatter in the resultant residuals , binned in five - minute intervals , and pick the version of the photometry that gives the minimum scatter .",
    "the binning is chosen so as to assess scatter in the data over time scales comparable to the duration of ingress and egress ( 21.8 minutes ) , which is more likely to affect the results of the light curve fits .",
    "we found that for 11 of the 12 secondary eclipses and one of the two transits , choosing the time - varying aperture photometry yielded the smallest residual scatter .",

    "however , there are many flux measurements at a given pixel location before and after ingress and egress , which statistically dominate the pixel map calculation",
    ". moreover , we obtain consistent results using a polynomial noise decorrelation function in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 position of the star centroid , a method that is not capable of removing such small - scale structure in the light curve during ingress and egress .",
    "ultimately , our lack of _ a priori _ knowledge of the precise center of eclipse time is much more important in potentially fitting away any astrophysical signal during ingress and egress ( see section  [ subsec : circulation ] ) .    before fitting to the model",

    "does not significantly affect the number of excised points .",
    "for each of the twelve eclipses , the percentage of data points removed is less than 0.5@xmath30 .",
    "the routines for fitting the secondary eclipse and transit light curves require precise values for the planet s orbital parameters .",
    "in particular , we need the planet s orbital period @xmath31 , inclination @xmath24 , eccentricity @xmath32 , scaled semi - major axis @xmath33 , and pericenter longitude @xmath34 , as well as the ratio between the planetary and stellar radii @xmath35 . when optimizing our choice of photometric aperture , we take values from @xcite for all orbital parameters except eccentricity and pericenter longitude , for which we take values from @xcite ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) . in the final version of our fits of individual eclipses and transits , we use the updated values for @xmath24 , @xmath35 , and @xmath33 in table  [ tab : best ] computed from our global fit ( see section  [ subsec : fits ] ) .",
    "we calculate the transit and eclipse light curves using the formalism of @xcite and include free parameters for the eclipse / transit depth @xmath38 and the center of eclipse / transit time @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , we approximate the planet s phase curve in the region of the secondary eclipse or transit as a linear function of time where the slope (  phase constant \" ) is a free parameter in our fits . because this phase curve slope is absent during the secondary eclipse , we keep the observed flux between second and third contacts constant at @xmath40 and scale the amplitudes of ingress and egress appropriately to match them to the out - of - eclipse phase curve . for fits to individual secondary eclipses we allow the depths and times to vary as free parameters along with the phase constant , while fixing @xmath24 , @xmath33 , and @xmath35 . in the case of transits ,",
    "the depth @xmath38 is equal to the square of the radius of the planet relative to that of the host star , @xmath35 , which we allow to vary as a free parameter while keeping @xmath24 and @xmath33 fixed . in our global fits , which include both the secondary eclipse and the transit light curves , we allow all of these parameters to vary freely in the fit .",
    "the host star xo-3 has an effective temperature @xmath6  k and a specific gravity @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "when fitting to the transit light curves , we use a four - parameter non - linear limb - darkening law @xcite with parameter values calculated for a star with @xmath41  k and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) .",
    "the fluxes measured within our photometric aperture display a strong correlation with variations in the position of the star on the array .",
    "this effect is due to the non - uniform sensitivity of an individual pixel across its area @xcite and must be accounted for when fitting the fluxes with the eclipse / transit model . in our analysis , we correct for this systematic effect in two different ways .    first , we adopt an approach similar to that used in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and include a second order polynomial function of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 positions of the star as part of the eclipse fit : @xmath47 we evaluate the utility of individual terms in this expression using the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of free parameters in the model ( including the parameters in the eclipse model ) , @xmath50 is the number of data points , and @xmath51 is the standard metric for goodness of fit . using this metric , we find that the constant and linear terms in the decorrelation function suffice for eclipses 1 , 3 , 7 , and 10 .",
    "the bic is minimized by including the @xmath52 term for eclipses 5 and 12 , by including the @xmath53 term for eclipses 2 , 5 , 6 , 8 , and 9 , and by including all the second - order terms for eclipse 11 .",
    "it is important to note that the intrinsic error in the light curve , which formally enters into the calculation of @xmath51 , is unknown , and our @xmath51 values are based solely on the spread in the residuals from the fits .",
    "however , the large number of data points available ensures we can obtain a reasonably accurate estimate of the noise in each data set , with a correspondingly small uncertainty in our calculation of the bic .",
    "we obtain consistent results for the eclipse depths and times using any decorrelation polynomial of at least first order .",

    "however , by using all twelve secondary eclipse observations in the combined fit , we are able to break this degeneracy and obtain a unique estimate of the phase curve slope in the region of the secondary eclipse .",
    "the observed increase in the planet s brightness is likely due to an increase in the atmospheric temperature due to increasing stellar irradiation experienced by the planet during secondary eclipse .",
    "another possible contributing factor may be changes in the apparent atmospheric brightness due to planetary rotation , which may be caused by an offset hotspot situated to the west of the substellar point during secondary eclipse .",
    "such an offset hotspot can be generated by either westward winds or the presence of clouds east of the substellar point .",
    "recent atmospheric circulation models do not readily produce westward winds that would lead to a westward offset of the hotspot at infrared wavelengths @xcite . while non - uniform clouds have been inferred from visible observations of kepler-7b @xcite , the significantly higher temperature and surface gravity of xo-3b place the equilibrium cloud decks at pressure levels greater than those probed by the 4.5-micron bandpass . yet",
    "another possibility is non - uniform atmospheric chemical composition across the planet . in particular ,",
    "variations in the abundance of co@xmath190 in the atmosphere of hot jupiters has been shown to induce changes in the 4.5-micron flux from one side to the other , though the effect on the variation of emergent flux with phase is largely dampened by longitudinal homogenization of chemical abundances through circulation @xcite .",
    "therefore , while all of these mechanisms may contribute to the brightening of xo-3b at the time of secondary eclipse , it is expected that the overall warming of the planet due to decreasing planet - star distance is the dominant factor . a full - orbit phase curve analysis of xo-3b is contained in a parallel study ( cowan et al .",

    "while the effects of condensation and/or turbulent mixing in the atmosphere of xo-3b may lead to some orbit - to - orbit variation in the eclipse depths , the relatively low level of variability evident in our data suggest that these processes do not appear to significantly alter the atmosphere s thermal structure on orbit - to - orbit ( and longer ) timescales at the pressure levels probed by the 4.5  @xmath0 m bandpass .",

    "@xcite argue that individual secondary eclipse measurements do not fully account for detector systematics , which may lead to poor reproducibility of individual eclipse depth measurements and result in apparently inconsistent values for the eclipse depth from one study to the next .",
    "the 2.1@xmath29 discrepancy between our global best - fit eclipse depth and the depth measured from the single 4.5  @xmath0 m observation in @xcite is consistent with this purported tendency to underestimate the uncertainties of single - eclipse depths .",
    "however , the notable self - consistency of the individual depth measurements for the twelve secondary eclipses analyzed in our work ( figure  [ params ] ) indicates that our technique of extracting photometry from the observations does adequately account for instrumental effects .",
