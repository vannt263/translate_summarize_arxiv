    "nonlinear rrn , for which the voltage drop @xmath17 over an individual resistor depends on some power @xmath1 of the current @xmath18 flowing through it , can be exploited to derive the fractal dimension of various substructures of percolation clusters .    in this paper",
    "we present in detail our study of nonlinear rrn by renormalized field theory .",
    "a brief account of this work has been given previously in@xcite .",
    "it is based on an approach by stephen@xcite , its refinements by harris and lubensky@xcite and its generalization to nonlinear resistors by harris@xcite .",
    "our work thrives on the interpretation of the involved feynman diagrams as being resistor networks themselves@xcite .",
    "this interpretation leads to a substantial simplification of the field theoretic calculations , as we demonstrate by calculating the fractal dimensions of the chemical length and the backbone to two- and three - loop order respectively .",

    "each occupied bond has a finite non zero conductance @xmath21 whereas unoccupied bonds have conductance zero .",
    "we suppose that the system is near the percolation threshold , i.e.  @xmath19 is close to the critical concentration @xmath22 above which an infinite cluster exists .",
