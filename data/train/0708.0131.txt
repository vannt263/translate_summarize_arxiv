    "effective theories that implement hadronic dynamics are considered the most efficient way to describe infinite nuclear matter because they allow to work in a specific energy scale while ignoring other degrees of freedom of the system . in the present work nuclear matter",
    "is considered at low temperature and low chemical potential , thus the relevant degrees of freedom are hadrons .",
    "typically two pathways are explored to get insight in hadronic matter properties , on the one side at high temperatures and low densities , heavy ion collisions , on the other hand exploring neutron stars at low temperatures and extreme densities @xcite . with the increase of temperature in the first case , or density in the second ,",
    "the quarks deconfine and chiral symmetry is effectively restored .",
    "although this feature can be relevant for the study of neutron star matter , the existing models able to describe it @xcite are very complex and do not allow a straightforward analysis of more complex functional dependence of the couplings , that is exactly the intention of this work . in this article we present a generalized model theory for hadron dynamics in a nuclear matter environment , supposed to exist in neutron stars , and discuss the density dependent nuclear matter compressibility and its response to the parameters of the theory . in an initial step the model theory",
    "is calibrated for densities where from the experimental point of view phenomenology is well under control . in a second step ,",
    "the undetermined parameters are partially fixed by a symmetry scheme or varied freely",
    ". the principal feature of our model theory is that it unites properties of a variety of approaches known in the literature ( @xcite and references therein ) at the cost of additional parameters .",
    "nevertheless , as the following discussion will show , only a straight range for those parameters is physically meaningful , so that the increase of degrees of freedom is considerably reduced by phenomenology .",
    "further we make profit from the fact that small variations in the parameters create considerable differences in the results . for example",
    "a change in the binding energy of nuclear matter of @xmath1 implies a decrease by @xmath2 solar masses for the maximum mass as predicted by a model for a specific family of neutron stars as shown in more detail below .",
    "for that reason a precise knowledge of input parameters is crucial in order to make predictions relevant for observation . in the present work",
    "the input parameters are : the binding energy and the asymmetry coefficient of nuclear matter , the effective mass of the baryons and the compression modulus at the nuclear matter saturation point .",
    "the compression modulus may be understood as a measure for the difficulty to remove the system from equilibrium or for the affinity to return to equilibrium .    until now",
    ", compressibility is one of the parameters determined with major uncertainty .",
    "one of the goals of the present work is to show the influence of the onset of hyperon presence and how this might be useful in pinning down the uncertainty in the compression modulus using observational evidences . to this end",
    "we calculate the compressibility for a large range of densities including the usually determined value at saturation density .",
    "the basis for our calculations is a quantum hadrodynamics motivated model including beside the nucleons also the hyperons which define the baryon octet ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "the nuclear medium effect is taken into account by a non - linear coupling involving the sigma field with adjustable parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which tune the intensity of the meson baryon couplings ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the considered mesons are the usual scalar @xmath14 and the isoscalar vector meson @xmath15 but also the isovector vector meson @xmath16",
    ". additionally the lepton degrees of freedom ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) establish or complement charge neutrality , depending on the density .",
    "the lagrangian density reads : @xmath19\\psi_b + \\sum_{\\ell}\\bar{\\psi}_{\\ell}(i\\gamma_{\\mu}\\partial^{\\mu}-m_{\\ell})\\psi_{\\ell } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma\\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma - m_{\\sigma}^2\\sigma^2 ) - \\frac{1}{4 } \\omega_{\\mu\\nu}\\omega^{\\mu\\nu } + \\frac{1}{2 } m_{\\omega}^2\\omega_{\\mu}\\omega^{\\mu } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{4}\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho_{\\mu\\nu}\\rho^{\\mu\\nu}$}+\\frac{1}{2 } m_{\\rho}^2\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho_{\\mu}\\rho^{\\mu}$},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath20 denotes a specific baryonic species and the index @xmath21 a specific leptonic species . here",
    "the adjustable coupling strengths are related with the usual coupling constants through @xmath22 and the adjustable coefficients @xmath23 that drive the dynamical influence of the hadronic medium are @xmath24 for @xmath25 , @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( see eq . [ cplng ] ) .",
    "these parameters are constrained in order to reproduce phenomenology , in the present case an effective mass at saturation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 nucleon masses and a compression modulus between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the nucleons are chosen in a way to have zero pressure and a determined energy at saturation ( calculated assuming a binding energy of @xmath32 and a density of @xmath33 at saturation and a bare nucleon mass of @xmath34 ) and to reproduce an asymmetry coefficient of @xmath35 . since no stringent experimental confirmation with respect to meson hyperon couplings is available and also possible nuclear medium effects on that couplings are an open question , one way to reduce these ambiguities is to use the @xmath36 flavor spin symmetry scheme as in ref .",

    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 vary independently .    for the first coupling scheme we find acceptable values for the effective mass and the compression modulus at saturation for @xmath46 . for the coupling scheme 2",
    "there are no acceptable values , which shows that the sigma field influence on the vector mesons is not `` universal '' . for the last coupling scheme",
    "there are acceptable values for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where both parameters correlate @xcite .",
    "a variety of combinations have shown us that only a considerable restricted choice of parameter combinations is possible in order to reproduce phenomenological meaningful quantities .",
    "the @xmath13 parameter can not be related to symmetric nuclear matter saturation properties as it relates to the @xmath16 meson and consequently to the isospin asymmetry .    depending on the density , the constituent particles of the system change . the hyperons decay into other hyperons so that baryon number conservation and chemical equilibrium have to be taken into account .",
    "note , that the chemical potential is the criterion which indicates the threshold where heavier baryons start to contribute to the chemical composition of nuclear matter .",
    "further charge neutrality shall hold , according to findings in the literature , that a spherically symmetric charged neutron star is not stable @xcite . to solve the system analytically and in a self - consistent way the mean - field approximation is used , since for higher densities the fluctuations of the meson fields are negligible",
