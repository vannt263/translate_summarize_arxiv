    "one of the major tools in the theory of algebraic groups is their correspondence with lie algebras .",

    "also for this it would be of great interest to exploit the connection with lie algebras . in this paper",
    "we treat a question that arises in this context , namely the problem to decide whether a given lie algebra corresponds to an algebraic group . in particular , a positive solution to this problems enables us to decide which subalgebras of a lie algebra of an algebraic group correspond to algebraic subgroups . to tackle this problem we restrict to base fields of characteristic @xmath0 ,",
    "because for that case there is a well developed theory of the connection between algebraic groups and lie algebras ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a connected algebraic group is completely determined by its lie algebra .",

    "this algebraic lie algebra is called the algebraic hull of @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of constructing the algebraic hull for a given @xmath13 .",
    "based on results of chevalley we describe an algorithm for constructing the algebraic hull .",
    "the computationally hardest step is to construct the splitting field of a polynomial .",
    "since this can be a rather formidable task , we subsequently give an algorithm which is similar in nature , but avoids the problem of having to construct splitting fields .",
    "this is based on algorithms for finding integral dependencies of algebraic integers . combining complex and @xmath15-adic approximations to the roots , and the technique of lattice reduction ( lll )",
    ", we obtain an algorithm for computing the @xmath16-module of integral relations among a given set of algebraic integers . in the literature ,",
    "several somewhat similar methods for solving this problem are know ( cf .",

    "these methods focus on finding one linear dependency , while our algorithms find ( a basis of ) the whole module of linear dependencies .",
