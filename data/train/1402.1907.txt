    "in the last few years , many exoplanetary systems containing hot jupiters have been be found to have high stellar obliquities , i.e. , large misalignment angles between the spin axis of the host star and the planetary orbital angular momentum axis ( e.g. , hebrard et al .",

    "this indicates that a large population of hot jupiters are formed through high - eccentricity channels , either via dynamical planet - planet scatterings ( rasio & ford 1996 ; weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ; chatterjee et al .  2008 ; juric & tremaine 2008 ) or / and secular interactions between multiple planets , or lidov - kozai effect induced by a distant companion ( e.g. , holman et al .  1997 ; wu & murray 2003 ; fabrycky & tremaine 2007 ; wu et al .  2007 ;",

    "( 2012 ) suggested that the observed stellar obliquities may result from the torques of varying directions deposited on the radiative stellar envelope by internally generated gravity waves .",
    "the observed stellar obliquities may also contain contributions from ( or be affected by ) possible `` primordial '' misalignment between the the stellar spin and the protoplanetary disc .",
    "several lines of evidence suggest that such primordial misalignment is possible :    \\(i ) in the solar system , all major planets lie in the same plane to within @xmath1 , but this plane is inclined with respect to the solar rotational equator by @xmath2 .",
    "\\(ii ) solar - type main - sequence binaries with separations @xmath3  au often have rotation axis misaligned relative to the orbital angular momentum ( hale 1994 ) . ( iii ) some binary young stellar objects ( ysos ) are observed to have circumstellar discs that are misaligned with the binary orbital plane ( e.g. , stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998,2003 ; neuhauser et al .",
    "also , several unresolved ysos or pre - main sequence binaries have jet axes along different directions compared to the binary axes , suggesting misaligned discs ( e.g. , davis , mundt & eislffel 1994 ; roccatagliata et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "\\(iv ) recently , stellar obliquities in several multiplanet systems have been measured or constrained .",
    "while for some systems ( kepler-30 , sanchis - ojeda et al .  2012 ; koi-94 and kepler-25 , albrecht et al .",
    "2013 , hirano et al .  2012 ; kepler-50 and kepler-65 , chaplin et al .",
    "2013 ) , the stellar obliquities are consistent with zero ( with typical error bars of order 10@xmath4 ) , highly misaligned systems have also been found . in particular , huber et al .",
    "( 2013 ) used asteroseismology to measure a large stellar obliquity ( @xmath5-@xmath6 ) for kepler-56 , a red giant star hosting two transiting coplanar planets with orbital period of 10.5 and 21 days . a companion in a wide orbit ( as suggested by radial velocity data ) may be responsible for the observed stellar obliquity ; but it is possible that the companion was already present in the protoplanetary disc phase and produced a primordial misalignment .",
    "also , there exists tentative evidence that the kepler-9 system , containing three transiting , roughly coplanar planets ( holman et al .",
    "2010 ) , has a misaligned stellar spin ( about 45@xmath4 ) with respect to the planetary orbit ( walkowicz & basri 2013 ) .",
    "hirano et al .",
    "( 2014 ) presented several other candidate misaligned multiplanet systems .",
    "in contrast to the above , the current observational situation with debris disc systems seems different . in a number of debris disc systems ,",
    "the stellar spin inclination ( relative to the line of sight ) @xmath7 is similar to the debris disc inclination @xmath8 , typically to within 10@xmath4 ( watson et al .",
    "2011 ; greaves et al .  2013 ; kennedy et al .",
    "while @xmath9 does not necessarily imply alignment between the spin axis and the disc axis , statistically these observations do suggest that there is no significant star - disc misalignment in these systems .",
    "there are several proposed mechanisms for tilting a star relative to its protoplanetary disc to produce primordial misalignment .",
    "bate et al .  (",
    "2010 ) suggested that in the chaotic star formation scenario , the accreting gas assembled onto a protoplanetary disc may have a varying direction of angular momentum , and thus the stellar spin direction can be different from the disc orientation at the later phase of accretion .",
    "misalignment may also be produced when a protostellar system encounters another disc / envelope system with a different direction of rotation ( thies et al .",
    "lai , foucart & lin ( 2011 ) showed that magnetic star - disc interaction produces a misalignment torque between the stellar spin and the disc axis ( see also lai 1999 ) .",
    "however , this torque is of the same order of magnitude as the accretion torque , which tends to align the spin with the disc . given the intrinsic complexity of the magnetic accretion physics , the net effect of the accretion and magnetic torques can not be definitively determined at present : all one can say is that small or modest spin - disc misalignments may be produced in some systems ; perhaps this is responsible for the @xmath2 anomaly in the solar system . to generate larger misalignments or",
    "retrograde discs require additional external perturbations ( such as varying orientations of outer discs ; see foucart & lai 2011 ) .",
    "recently , batygin ( 2012 ) suggested that the precession of a protoplanetary disc driven by the gravitational torque from an inclined binary companion can lead to misalignment between the stellar spin and the disc axis .",
    "this scenario is appealing since the same inclined binary companion is needed to make misaligned hot jupiters through the secular lidov - kozai effect .",
    "batygin & adams ( 2013 ) further considered the coupling between the rotating central star and the precessing disc , and showed that significant misaligment between star and disc can be produced .",
    "since a large fraction of protostars are in binaries , the scenarios examined by batygin ( 2012 ) and batygin & adams ( 2013 ) are of great interest and the mechanism of producing misalignment may be very robust . on the other hand ,",
    "as noted above , the observational situation concerning spin - disc misalignment is confusing at present , with some protoplanetary discs showing misalignment , while many debris disc systems showing no significant misalignment .    in this paper",
    "we study the interactions between a protoplanetary disc , its host star and an external binary companion on an inclined orbit in order to understand the possibility and conditions of generating large spin - disc misalignments .",
    "our approach to this problem is different from that of batygin ( 2012 ) and batygin & adams ( 2013 ) , and we also examine several additional physical effects not considered before .",
    "in particular , we model the star - disc - binary gravitational interactions directly using angular momentum equations ( sections 2 - 3 ) .",
    "this allows us to describe the rotational dynamics of the system clearly in a physical way and see how different behaviours may arise under different conditions ( i.e. , different parameters of the system , such as disc size , rotation of the central star and the binary separation ) .",
    "we elucidate the significance of `` secular resonance '' in a geometric way ( see fig .  2 below ) ",
    "such resonance plays an important role in producing large spin - disc misalignments . in section 4 ,",
    "we study the effects of mass accretion and magnetic interaction between the star and the disc , including the possibility of magnetically driven spin - disc misalignment .",
    "we also briefly examine the effect of disc inclination damping ( relative to the binary ) associated with viscous dissipation of disc warping ( section 5 ) .",
    "overall , we find that all these effects can influence the final star - disc inclination significantly , and a variety of misalignment angles can be produced when a protostar disc is perturbed by a binary companion . in section 6 ,",
    "we summarize the key physical effects and results ( e.g. , the conditions for resonance crossing ) , and discuss the implications of our findings for stellar binaries , protoplanetary / debris discs and the formation of misaligned planets .",
    "we consider a protostellar system consisting of a primary star @xmath10 surrounded by a disc and an external binary companion @xmath11 ( see figure 1 ) . to simplify the equations throughout the paper , we introduce dimensionless stellar mass , radius and rotation rate as _",

    "the observed @xmath14 for pre - main - sequence stars lies in the range between 1 and 10  days ( e.g. gallet & bouvier 2013 ) . for magnetic protostars ,",

    "the disc mass decreases in time due to accretion and mass outflow , with a lifetime of about 10  myrs ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "the shape of the disc surface density profile also evolves in time . for simplicity , in this paper",

    ", we mostly assume that the disc is flat ( with negligible warp ) and precesses like a rigid body . the exception in section 6 , where we consider the viscous damping of disc inclination due to disc warp .",
    "the reason the disc behaves as a rigid body is that different regions of the disc can communicate efficiently through bending waves and internal viscous stress ( e.g. , papaloizou & pringle 1983 ; papaloizou & lin 1995 ; papaloizou & terquem 1995 ; ogilvie 1999,2006 ; bate et al .",

    "finally we briefly explore the effect of disc inclination damping ( relative to the binary ) associated with viscous dissipation of disc warps ( section 5 ) . only with extreme damping timescales ( less than 1 myrs ) can the spin - disc misalignments be significantly affected . by comparing with the observations of spin - orbit misalignments in wide binaries and spin - disc misalignments in protostellar systems",
    ", it may be possible to constrain the physics of disc warp dissipations .",
    "the general implication of our work is that in the presence of a binary companion , stellar spin - disc misalignments can be generated within the typical lifetimes of protoplanetary discs under a wide range of conditions , as long as the binary axis is somewhat misaligned with the disc axis ( by more than a few degrees ) .",
    "there is ample evidence of such disc - binary misalignments from observations of protostellar jets or direct imagings of protostellar discs ( see section 1 ) .",
    "in fact , for very reasonable binary / disc parameters , it has proven difficult to avoid the production of significant spin - disc misalignments from small initial values .",
    "although challenging , it would be of great interest to measure or constrain the spin - disc inclination angles of young protostellar disc systems ( rather than debris disc systems ; see below ) .    our general conclusion is consistent with the observations of spin - orbit misalignments in wide ( @xmath225  au )",
    "binaries ( hale 1994 ) .",
    "since there is significant evolution of the spin - disc misalignment angle during the lifetime of the disc , our work suggests that the observed spin - orbit misalignments do not necessarily translate into a large difference in the angular momentum directions of separate molecular cloud cores that form the binary components .",
    "concerning giant planets , our work suggests that spin - disc misalignments generated by star - disc - binary interactions can make a significant contribution to the observed spin - orbit misalignments in hot jupiter systems .",
    "such misalignments may already be present prior to any subsequent ( after disc dispersal ) dynamical processes .",
    "indeed , the same kind of inclined binaries are invoked in the lidov - kozai mechanism for producing hot jupiters ( see references in section 1 ) .",
    "moreover , in order for the lidov - kozai migration to operate on a planet at the semi - major axis @xmath226 , the kozai oscillation period ( @xmath227 ) p_kozai10 ^ 6(a_500au)^3 ( a_p5au)^-3yrs must be shorter than the apsidal precession period of the planetary orbit due to general relativity ( e.g. , holman et al .",
    "that is , the ratio 610 ^ -3 ( ) ( a_500au)^3 ( a_p5au)^-4 must be less than unity .",
    "thus , if the planet was formed at @xmath228  au or had migrated ( due to disc - driven migration ) to such a distance by the end of the protoplanetary disc phase , the binary companion ( assuming @xmath229  au ) would not be able to induce any kozai oscillation",
    ". nevertheless , such `` failed - kozai '' systems may still have significant spin - orbit misalignments because of the primordial spin - disc misalignments studied in this paper .",
    "of course , whether such systems can have any significant eccentricities or can become hot jupiters is a different question . in this regard ,",
    "it is of interest to note that there appears to be a significant lack of super - eccentric proto - hot jupiters in the kepler sample ( dawson et al .",
    "2012 ) , suggesting that many hot jupiters are not produced by high - eccentricity migration mechanism ( see socrates et al .",
    "2012 ; dawson & murray - clay 2013 ) .",
    "to predict the planet s orbital inclination at the end of the protoplanetary disc phase , it will be necessary to keep track of the evolution of the planet s angular momentum ( both magnitude and direction ) as the disc evolves and precesses , together with all the other effects considered in this paper .",
    "planet - disc interaction will be an important part of the story ( e.g. , baruteau et al .",
    "2013 ; see also marzari & nelson 2009 ; terquem 2013 ; xiang - gruess & papaloizou 2013 ) .",
    "presumably , when the disc is sufficiantly massive as the planet forms and evolves , the angular momentum of the planet will be strongly coupled to that of the disc . if the planet migrates to the close vicinity of the star , the mutual torque between the star and the planet must also be considered .",
    "we plan to address some of these issues in the future .",
    "concerning debris disc systems , current observations do not reveal any evidence of significant spin - disc misalignments ( watson et al .",
    "2011 ; greaves et al .  2013 ; kennedy et al .  2013 ) .",
    "this suggests that the observed / measured systems , so far , do not have binary companions at all or companions with appropriate separations . finding binary companions in debris disc systems and measure / constrain the relative orientations of spin",
    ", disc and binary axes would be of great interest .",
    "on the theoretical side , it would be necessary to extend our study to much later times ( beyond 10  myrs ) .",

    "<S> we study the interactions between a protostar and its circumstellar disc under the influence of an external binary companion to determine the evolution of the mutual misalignment between the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational torque on the disc from an inclined binary companion makes the disc precess around the binary axis , while the star - disc interaction torque due to the rotation - induced stellar quadrupole tends to make the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess around each other . </S>",
    "<S> a significant star - disc misalignment angle can be generated from a small initial value as the star - disc system evolves in time ( e.g. , with decreasing disc mass ) such that the two precession frequencies cross each other . </S>",
    "<S> this `` secular resonance '' behaviour can be understood in a simple , geometric way from the precession dynamics of spin and disc angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the general conditions for such resonance crossing to occur , and find that they can be satisfied for very reasonable protostar - disc - binary parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of star - disc inclination is also significantly affected by mass accretion from the disc onto the central star and by magnetic star - disc interaction torques , which can either promote or reduce star - disc misalignment , as well as by the possible damping of disc - binary inclination due to viscous dissipation of disc warps . in general , </S>",
    "<S> as long as the initial binary - disc inclination is not too small ( greater than a few degrees ) , a variety of star - disc misalignment angles can be generated within the lifetimes of protoplanetary discs ( @xmath0  myrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of our results for the observations of stellar spin orientations in binaries , for the alignments / misalignments of protostellar discs and debris discs relative to their host stars , and for the observed stellar obliquities in exoplanetary systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if hot jupiters are produced by the secular lidov - kozai effect induced by an external stellar companion present in the protostellar phase , then it is likely that `` primordial '' star - disc misalignments are already generated by the star - disc - binary interactions . even for systems where the kozai effect is suppressed , misaligned planets and hot jupiters </S>",
    "<S> may still be produced during the protoplanetray disc phase .    </S>",
