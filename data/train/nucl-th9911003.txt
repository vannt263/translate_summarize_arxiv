    "correlated many particle systems such as , e.g. nuclear matter or strongly coupled plasmas , have a complicated dynamical behavior . only few areas of the density - temperature phase diagram used to characterize the state of the system in thermal equilibrium may be described in the approximation of noninteracting quasiparticles .",
    "the dynamics of the quasiparticle is determined by the mean field of the other particles and therefore some prominent features like self - energy corrections and pauli blocking ( bose enhancement ) are sufficiently taken into account  @xcite . however due to sizable residual interactions many interesting and exciting phenomena , such as clustering , formation of condensates , and phase transitions occur .",
    "the description of the dynamics of such systems is particularly difficult since the quasiparticle approach reaches its limits .    a large number of these phenomena such as , e.g. two - particle bound state formation ,",
    "can already be accounted for by explicitly introducing two - body correlations into the formalism .",
    "this may be achieved in the frame work of the green function method  @xcite and leads to effective two - body equations that include medium effects in a consistent way .",
    "the density temperature planes of nuclear matter are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nt_proc ] and [ fig : corr ] .",
    "the phase diagram of nuclear matter turns out to be very rich .",
    "in particular the superfluid phase reflecting strong pairing is relevant for the structure of neutron stars  @xcite . at lower densities",
    "bound states occur .",
    "this part of the phase diagram may be accessed in the laboratory through heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "the description of these phenomena in the framework spelled out here constitues a wide and exciting area for an application of few - body methods .    besides the pairing of nucleons , correlations with more particles are also important .",
    "based on the suitably modified ags ( alt - grassberger - sandhas  @xcite ) formalism the reaction cross section for break - up ( @xmath0 ) , relevant e.g. for the formation of deuterons in a heavy - ion reaction , has been given in  @xcite .",
    "as a first application the life time of deuteron fluctuations in nuclear matter was calculated in  @xcite . in @xcite we have given an exploratory calculation of the four - body condensate in strongly coupled fermionic systems .",
    "the formalism to derive few - body green functions within the dyson equation approach or cluster mean field approximation at finite temperatures and densities has been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "here we give some of the basic results and focus on bound states .",
    "let the hamiltonian of the system be given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 etc .",
    "denotes the heisenberg operator of the particle with quantum numbers @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc . for spin , momentum etc . in the equal time formalism",
    "we may introduce creation and annihilation operators @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , etc .",
    "for one - particle , hole - particle , three - particle operators .",
    "we describe the propagation of these clusters via the green s function at @xmath7 .",
    "however , generalization to @xmath8 is straight forward using the matsubara technique  @xcite .",
    "the definition of the green s function reads @xmath9 where averaging is due to the density operator @xmath10 . for an open system in thermodynamical equilibrium",
    "the extremum condition for the entropy leads to the following expression for the density operator of a grand canonical quantum ensemble , @xmath11 the temperature ( @xmath12 ) and the chemical potential @xmath13 are the corresponding lagrange parameters .",
    "the dyson equation is @xmath14_\\pm\\rangle + \\sum_{{\\gamma}}\\int d\\bar t\\ ; { { \\cal m}^{t-\\bar t}_{{\\alpha}{\\gamma } } } \\;{\\cal g}^{\\bar t - t'}_{{\\gamma}{\\beta}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use @xmath15_\\pm\\rangle$ ] in the following , where the upper ( lower ) sign reflect fermi ( bose ) type operators .",
    "the mass matrix is given by  @xcite @xmath16(t),a_{\\beta}^\\dagger(t)]\\rangle\\\\ ( { \\cal m}^{t - t'}{\\cal n})_{{\\alpha}{\\beta},\\rm irr}&= & -i \\langle t [ a_{\\alpha},h](t),[h , a^\\dagger_{\\beta}](t')\\rangle_{\\rm irr}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath17 , i.e. the one - particle case , neglecting the term @xmath18 ( representing all retarded irreducible diagrams ) leads to the self - energy shift in mean field ( e.g. hartree - fock ) approximation . for a given potential",
    "this constitutes a selfconsistent problem to determine @xmath13 and @xmath19 , to be solved by iteration @xmath20 for @xmath21 this function approaches a step function at the respective fermi momentum .",
    "nuclear matter can not be considered as a system of independent quasi particles but for a large part it is correlated and , e.g. in the superfluid phase as demonstrated in fig .  [ fig : corr ]  @xcite .",
    "the basis to treat correlated densities is provided by a generalization of the beth - uhlenbeck approach  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear density @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the two , three - particle correlations , present as bound / scattering states . in first iteration these correlations may be treated on the basis of residual interactions between the quasi particles .",
    "the exact two particle equations to be solved are known as bethe - goldstone or feynman - galitski equations depending on some details  @xcite . in ladder approximation",
    "the two - body equation reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the normalization is given by @xmath27 where the dual wave functions @xmath28 are defined by @xmath29 .",
    "introducing the two - body @xmath30-matrix in a standard fashion both bound and scattering states have been solved  @xcite . in first approximation @xmath31 of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : green2 ] ) corresponds to the bare force .",
    "however , at higher densities the force may be substantially screened .    as an example for an in - medium bound state the deuteron binding energy",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deut ] .",
    "the mott density is defined through the condition @xmath32 .",
    "note that the fermi functions @xmath33 for particle 1 etc .",
    "depend on the relative momentum @xmath34 between the deuteron and the medium .",
    "the deuteron in the medium also has a finite life time . to second order born approximation the life time can be extracted from the square of the graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "one sees that the width @xmath35 is given by the incoherent decay of the deuteron into 3p-1h states . at zero temperature one evaluates the 3p-1h density of states @xmath36 since the normalization of the deuteron wave function brings a factor @xmath37 we have @xmath38 . at finite temperatures",
    "@xmath39 we get as in fermi liquid theory for zero sound a @xmath40 behavior for @xmath35 . in a more elaborated theory one",
    "has to consider rescattering of the incoming deuteron with the nucleon(s ) of the medium .",
    "summing up all the respective diagrams leads to a generic three - body in - medium scattering matrix , that has been derived in  @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the reaction rate depends strongly on the surrounding medium .",
    "the numerical result for the life - time of the deuteron is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : life ] , where we in addition compare the use of the isolated to the in - medium break - up cross section at @xmath41 mev and a nuclear density of @xmath42 @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the medium dependent elementary cross section leads to shorter fluctuation times .",
    "as expected the difference is vanishing for larger momenta .",
    "in turn this effect leads to faster chemical relaxation times that is e.g. relevant for the notion of freeze out in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the appearance of a sharp pole at @xmath44 in the respective green function related to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : green2 ] ) corresponds to the thouless criterion for the onset of superfluidity for @xmath45 cooper pairs .",
    "depending on the channels considered , it allows us to determine the critical temperatures @xmath46 or @xmath47 for the respective isospin singlet and triplet channels , as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] and later in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] for @xmath48 . using the canonical relation @xmath49",
    "one realizes that the @xmath45 gap has a maximum value of @xmath50 mev .",
    "this is more than 3 times larger than the @xmath51 gap !",
    "such high values may have an influence in expanding nuclear matter as produced in central heavy ion collisions .",
    "an interesting extension of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : green2 ] ) is to write this equation down for the case where we have a condensate of pairs , i.e. a superfluid state . for pairs at rest one",

    "the chemical potential @xmath13 and the density are related by @xmath58 .",
    "we see that for a superfluid state eq .",
    "( [ eqn : green2 ] ) has turned into eq .",
    "( [ eqn : deut0 ] ) . besides its nonlinearity corresponding to the gap the latter has a similar structure as the linear eq .",
    "( [ eqn : green2 ] ) .",
    "one also realizes that for the zero density limit @xmath59 eq .  ( [ eqn : deut0 ] ) turns into the schrdinger equation for the deuteron .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : deutfkt ] where we show the fourier transform of @xmath60 , i.e. the cooper pair wave function for decreasing densities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deutfkt ] is taken from  @xcite ) .",
    "one clearly sees that the @xmath45 cooper pair wave function approaches the free deuteron wave function in the zero density limit .",
    "a first three - body equation for quasiparticles embedded in a medium at zero temperature has been given in  @xcite .",
    "here we present the equation for the wave function @xmath61 \\;\\psi_3(e ) \\label{eqn : green3}\\ ] ] together with the normalization @xmath62 where the dual wave functions are defined by by @xmath63 .",
    "an extension to finite temperatures uses the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) formalism to treat scattering phenomena and has been given in  @xcite . for a numerical solution of the scattering problem we use a separable ansatz for the strong nucleon - nucleon potential  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite we have calculated the break up cross section @xmath0 and found considerable dependence of the deuteron fluctuation time on the proper treatment of the medium dependence  @xcite , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : life ] .",
    "the influence of this refined treatment on the relaxation times is treated in  @xcite .",
    "the solution for the medium modified three - body bound state using the yamaguchi and the paris potential for comparison is provided in  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : trip ] shows the triton binding energy depending on different c.m .",
    "momenta as a function of the nuclear density and fig .",
    "[ fig : mottp ] shows the mott momentum . below the respective lines",
    "no deuterons / triton exist as bound states .",
    "a very interesting situation can also happen when a sharp pole at @xmath64 appears in the in - medium three - body equation ( [ eqn : green3 ] ) .",
    "then the original fermi gas becomes unstable with respect to the new fermi gas composed out of three - body clusters . for a very low density nuclear matter",
    "this could be a fermi gas of @xmath65he or tritons . though this case may be somewhat academic because of the presence of other type of clusters , e.g. @xmath66-particles",
    ", one may think of another situation where this consideration may become very relevant ; suppose one cools down a quark gluon plasma to the point that nucleons ( and other hadrons ) appear .",
    "then the quark fermi gas transforms into a nucleon fermi gas . a relativistic equation describing this transition should have a similar structure as eq .",
    "( [ eqn : green3 ] ) .",
    "from such an equation the critical temperature for the transition from quark gas to nucleon gas could be studied .",
    "the four - nucleon correlation is believed to play a significant role for lower densities and temperatures because of the strong binding energy of the @xmath66-particle .",
    "exploratory calculations using a simple variational ansatz for the @xmath67he wave function predict an @xmath66 condensate / quartetting on top of the deuteron condensate / triplet pairing that leads to superfluidity  @xcite .",
    "bose systems behave quite differently with respect to the occurrence of bound states .",
    "the bose functions enhance the effective residual interaction that might lead to an `` opposite mott effect '' , i.e. existence of bound states and also pairing ( condensate ) even if no bound state exist for the isolated case .",
    "an example is provided by a pion gas , were a pionic condensate may occur  @xcite that are discussed , e.g. in the context of neutron stars  @xcite .    in the framework",
    "utilized here the four body schrdinger equation for the bound state problem reads @xmath68 \\;\\psi^\\nu_4(e ) \\label{eqn : green4}\\ ] ] with the normalization  @xcite @xmath69 and the dual wave functions @xmath70 .",
    "the solution for @xmath71 provides the critical temperature @xmath72 for @xmath66 condensates as a function of the chemical potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] ( left ) , or of the density as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] ( right ) . using a variational ansatz to model the four - body wave function the transition to quartetting outreaches the transition to isospin singlet pairing if the density is smaller than @xmath73 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "this may again be relevant in expanding nuclear matter or even in the far tail of the density of a nucleus .",
    "one may suspect that the asymmetry of nuclear matter hinders the formation of @xmath45 pairing or of quartetting .",
    "this is because extra neutrons pauli - block the formation of cooper pairs .",
    "however , once the density is so low that the corresponding chemical potentials turn negative , then the blocking effect , i.e. the pauli principle is less effective and formation of deuterons and @xmath66 particles should not be much unfavored in asymmetric matter with respect to the symmetric case .",
    "we have studied the formation of clusters and their condensation in fermi systems using the dyson equation approach to many - body green s functions .",
    "they only depend on the c.m .",
    "energy of the cluster and therefore the resulting equations are of the schrdinger type .",
    "to lowest order the in - medium @xmath74-body equations are  compared to the isolated case  only modified by rpa phase space factors on the two - body matrix elements ( leading to self - energy corrections and modified interactions ) .",
    "such equations have early been written down by the japanese school  @xcite .",
    "we here investigate them with respect to the mott effect and bose - einstein condensation in homogeneous matter .",
    "it is found that deuteron cooper pairs survive longer than @xmath66-particle quartets at high densities but that , not unexpectedly , @xmath66-particles win in the low density limit .",
    "we give the mott density for deuterons and tritons and discuss the pauli principle aspect of the phase transition of a quark fermi gas to a nucleon fermi gas .",
    "life time effects of the clusters are also considered . to second order born approximation",
    "they behave like @xmath75 , where @xmath74 is the nucleon number in the cluster",
    ". therefore @xmath74-body clusters at @xmath76 and @xmath7 have infinite life time .    although we have taken examples from nuclear physics , the exact treatment of few - body systems embedded in the medium is not restricted to nuclear physics .",
    "further potential applications are possible , e.g. in the field of semiconductors to treat the formation of excitons or the trion bound state in the dense low dimensional electron plasmas . for recent experiments",
    "see e.g.  @xcite",
    ". for highly ionized dense plasmas the impulse approximation may fail for the three - particle break - up cross section needed to calculate the ionization and recombination rates .",
