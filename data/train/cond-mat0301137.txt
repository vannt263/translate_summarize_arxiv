    "@xcite the result for @xmath152 as obtained by the use of the two - site reference system ( `` dynamical impurity approximation '' , dia with @xmath108 ) is shown in fig .",

    "it is remarkable that the simple @xmath108-dia ( which requires the diagonalization of a dimer model only ) yields @xmath152 in an almost quantitative agreement with the full dmft .",

    "more important , however , there is no need for a fit procedure in the present approach ; any arbitrariness in the method to find the siam parameters is avoided completely .",

    "for hubbard - type lattice models with on - site interaction several relations to and generalizations of existing approaches are obtained immediately .",
    "the numerical results obtained by considering a rather simple reference system clearly demonstrate the practicability of the theory .",

    "for the definition of @xmath161 $ ] , invertibility of the functional @xmath162 $ ] is required .",
    "the _ local _ invertibility of @xmath162 $ ] is controlled by the jacobian @xmath163 .",
    "the two - particle self - energy @xcite @xmath164 can be assumed to be non - singular in general .    for a further analysis",
    "we need the following _ lemma : _ consider the interaction @xmath13 to be fixed",
    ". then two different green s functions @xmath165 and @xmath166 must result from two different sets of one - particle parameters @xmath167 and @xmath168 , respectively .",
    "the _ proof _ is straightforward : consider the high - frequency expansion of the green s function @xmath169 .",
    "the coefficients are given by the moments @xmath170_+\\rangle$ ] with @xmath171_-$ ] .",
    "using the symmetry @xmath172 one has : @xmath173 now @xmath174 implies the @xmath175 coefficients to be different because @xmath176 consequently , we must have @xmath177 .",
    "the lemma shows that the relation @xmath178 is one - to - one .",
    "consequently , we can write @xmath162 = { \\bf \\sigma}[{\\bf t}'[{\\bf g}]]$ ] and @xmath179 with a non - singular jacobian @xmath180 .",
    "hence , a singular @xmath164 implies a singular @xmath181 and vice versa .",
    "however , @xmath181 is just the `` projector '' in the euler equation ( [ eq : euler ] ) .",
    "we conclude that local non - invertibility of the functional @xmath162 $ ] at @xmath182 is indicated by @xmath183 / \\partial t'_{\\bf n } = 0 $ ] with @xmath184 for a certain `` direction '' @xmath4 in the space of hopping paramters .",
    "for such a direction , the euler equation ( [ eq : euler ] ) would be satisfied _",
    "trivially_.    referring to the present numerical results , one can state that generally the projector @xmath181 is non - singular in fact , as has been expected .",
    "there is one exception , however , namely points in the hopping - parameter space where one or more bath sites are _ decoupled _ from the rest of the system ( vanishing hybridization @xmath99 ) . here",
    "the one - particle energy of a decoupled bath site can be varied without changing the trial self - energy . even for this case",
    ", however , there are no formal difficulties with the inverse functional @xmath161 $ ] : to ensure the local invertibility of @xmath162 $ ] , one simply has to restrict the space of variational parameters @xmath38 by excluding the one - particle energies of the decoupled bath sites , i.e.  one has to focus on the physically relevant parameters .",
    "this implies a respective restriction of the space of @xmath38-representable green s functions @xmath185 and ensures the local invertibility of @xmath162 $ ] on the restricted domain .",
    "similarly , a restriction of the @xmath38 space becomes necessary to ensure the local invertibility of @xmath162 $ ] in case of a system where the self - energy is trivial ( as e.g.  for a model of spinless fermions with nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions where the self - energy is given by the hartree term , cf .",
    "ref .  ) .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that generally the functional @xmath162 $ ] can not be inverted _",
    "globally_. consider , for example , the hubbard model on the infinite - dimensional hypercubic lattice with nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath186 at half - filling .",
    "due to manifest particle - hole symmetry , a sign change of the hopping @xmath187 leaves the ( local ) self - energy invariant but transforms ( the non - local elements of ) the green s function @xmath1 . we conclude that @xmath161 $ ] in general can not be defined uniquely . due to this non - uniqueness , and also due to non - linearity , there may be more than a single solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : stat ] ) .",
    "however , this does not cause any problem since for any @xmath188 satisfying ( [ eq : stat ] ) we have : @xmath189 & = & ( { \\bf g}_0^{-1 } - { \\bf \\sigma})^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\      \\rightarrow \\qquad    { \\bf \\sigma } & = & { \\bf \\sigma}({\\bf g}_0^{-1 } - { \\bf \\sigma})^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\      \\rightarrow \\qquad    { \\bf \\sigma } & = & { \\bf \\sigma}[{\\bf g } ] \\quad \\mbox{and } \\quad    { \\bf g } = ( { \\bf g}_0^{-1 } - { \\bf \\sigma})^{-1 } \\ : .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this means that @xmath8 is given by the ( formal ) sum of all skeleton diagrams built up by a propagator @xmath1 which is constructed via the dyson equation from the same @xmath8 in turn .",
    "hence , any stationary point should be regarded as a physically meaningful solution . among different physical solutions ( corresponding e.g.  to different phases )",
