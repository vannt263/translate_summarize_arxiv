    "so far ( untyped or typed ) lambda calculi with the facility of nondeterminism have been studied : recently e.g. , in @xcite . for example , in @xcite nondeterminism is represented by using union type , while parallelism by using intersection type : this means that nondeterminism corresponds to the logical connective `` or '' and parallelism to `` and '' .",
    "further this means that nondeterminism and parallelism are dual notions each other .",
    "basically other researchers similarly classify nondeterminism and parallelism . in this paper",
    ", we advocate that nondeterminism and parallelism are not dual notions . for this",
    "we use the framework of linear logic @xcite . in linear logic",
    ", usual logical connectives are classified into two : multiplicative and additive connectives .",
    "our advocacy is that nondeterminism and parallelism are classified in `` computation as normalization '' paradigm as follows :    * nondeterminism = additive .",
    "* parallelism = multiplicative .",
    "already it has been pointed out that the multiplicative connectives are deeply related to parallelism since the appearance of @xcite . currently v.pratt studies the relationship intensively in the context of chu space @xcite . here",
    "we point out that the additive connectives are deeply related to nondeterminism .",
    "we incorporate nondeterminism facility into the framework of linear logic by introducing new additive connective @xmath0 ( nondeterministic with ) , which is self - dual . in the framework ,",
    "nondeterminism is represented by reduction of cut between two @xmath0 : by the reduction of @xmath0 from one proof net two proof nets are obtained .",
    "note that standard linear logic is deterministic : this means proof nets have church - rosser property in the syntactical level and there are some `` deterministic '' denotational semantics of linear logic in the semantical level .",
    "so in order to incorporate nondeterminism into the framework of linear logic , we must introduce the new connective .",
    "our advocacy has not been advocated before as far as we know in the context of `` computation as normalization '' paradigm .",
    "also i believe that such a classification contributes to studies w.r.t .",
    "relationship between linear logic and process calculus .",
    "+ on the other hand , our nondeterministic linear logic also contributes to the study of the logical aspect of complexity theory in the context of `` computation as normalization '' paradigm .",
    "we can encode any nondeterministic polynomial - time turing machine into a proof ( or a proof net ) of nondeterministic light linear logic .",
    "the encoding is a nondeterministic version of girard s encoding deterministic polynomial - time turing machines into proofs of light linear logic .",
    "but our polymorphic encoding of nondeterministic computations is original . also by using the same method",
    ", we can formulate nondeterministic elementary linear logic and prove the similar statement .",
    "this is the main technical contribution of this paper .",
    "the system ndmall is usual mall ( the multiplicative additive fragment of linear logic ) with @xmath0 ( nondeterministic with ) .",
    "the connective has arity 2 ( hence in ndmall @xmath1 is accepted as a formula if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are ndmall formulas ) .",
    "the negation of @xmath1 is defined as follows : @xmath4 the inference rules for ndmall are the same as mall except for the following rule : @xmath5{\\vdash \\gamma , a \\ndwith b } { \\vdash \\gamma , a & \\vdash \\gamma , b}\\ ] ] the notion of proofs ( in sequent calculus ) of ndmall is defined in usual manner . obviously the connective @xmath0 belongs to additives .",
    "the problematic point of ndmall is that any sequent of the form @xmath6 does not has the proof of @xmath7-long normal form , i.e. , consisting of just atomic formulas .",
    "but for example , many modal logics also do not have such proofs , even cut - free systems .",
    "we believe nondeterministic linear logic can be accepted as a logical system . though even you does not agree with the belief , you should accept our system as a type system for nondeterministic computations .",
    "+ in practice , the connective does not occur in conclusions of ndmall proofs : if it occurs in them , then in one sided sequent calculus ( or in the formulation of proof nets ) it behaves like @xmath8 in completely the same manner .",
    "hence we can assume that @xmath0 does not occur in cut free ndmall proofs .",
    "we omit cut elimination procedure for @xmath0 in ndmall sequent calculus .",
    "but we will introduce the procedure using ndmall proof nets in section  [ simpleos ] .",
    "first we shall define ndmall proof structures , which are basically the same as them in @xcite except for connective @xmath0 . simply by formulas we mean ndmall formulas .",
