    "the universe is presently undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion .",
    "several candidates have been proposed in the literature to explain this cosmic accelerated expansion , such as dark energy models , the generalized chaplygin gas , modified gravity and scalar - tensor theories , tachyon scalar fields and specific braneworld models , such as the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model .",
    "however , it was pointed out that assuming that dark energy is governed by a perfect fluid equation of state may systematically induce wrong results and be misleading in inferring the nature of dark energy @xcite . in this spirit",
    ", an alternative model was recently proposed without the presence of exotic fluids and modifications of the friedmann equations , using a more complicated equation of state , namely , the van der waals ( vdw ) equation of state  @xcite , given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy density and @xmath2 the pressure of the vdw fluid .",
    "the accelerated and decelerated periods depend on the parameters , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the equation of state , and in the limiting case @xmath6 , one recovers the dark energy equation of state , with @xmath7 .",
    "it was also stressed that the perfect fluid equation of state @xmath8 reflects an approximation of cosmic epochs describing stationary situations , where phase transitions are not considered @xcite .",
    "thus , one of the advantages of the vdw model is that it describes the transition from a matter field dominated era to a scalar field dominated epoch , without introducing scalar fields .",
    "furthermore , it is useful to explain the universe with a minimal number of ingredients , and the vdw gas actually treats dark matter and dark energy as a single fluid . the vdw quintessence scenario has also been confronted successfully with a wide variety of observational tests , by constraining the free parameters @xcite .",
    "the success of this model has stimulated several different approaches .",
    "recently , a model with a binary mixture whose constituents are described by a vdw fluid and by a dark energy density was also proposed @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that this model can simulate several aspects , namely , an inflationary period where the acceleration grows exponentially ; and a present accelerated period where the dark energy density dominates over the energy density of the vdw fluid .",
    "the construction of a general scheme where the vdw ideal fluid has a mathematically equivalent representation as a scalar - tensor theory with a specific potential , as well as explicit examples were also explored in ref .",
    "another approach has been analyzed in the context of brane cosmology @xcite , where the cosmological fluid on the brane is modeled by the vdw equation of state .",
    "it was shown that this model reproduces several features , namely , an initial accelerated epoch where the vdw fluid behaves like a scalar field with a negative pressure , and a present accelerated phase due to a cosmological constant on the brane .    despite of the fact that the vdw equation of state represents a spatially homogeneous cosmic fluid and",
    "is assumed not to cluster , due to gravitational instabilities inhomogeneities may arise .",
    "thus , the solutions outlined in this paper may possibly originate from density fluctuations in the cosmological background , resulting in the nucleation through the respective density perturbations .",
    "therefore , the pressure in the vdw equation of state may be regarded a radial pressure , and the transverse pressure is determined through the einstein field equations .",
    "the justification of this approach may be considered as an extension of the construction of inhomogeneous wormhole spacetimes supported by phantom energy  @xcite .",
    "the latter construction was motivated by the analysis carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where time - dependent solutions were constructed with ghost scalar fields . in this model , it was shown that the radial pressure is negative everywhere and equals the transverse pressure far from the throat , showing that ghost scalar fields behave essentially as dark energy .",
    "now , in the vdw context , one may also consider , in principle , that for large radial distances in these inhomogeneous solutions the radial pressure equals the transverse pressure , and thus behaving essentially as a vdw cosmological fluid , consequently justifying the above approach .",
    "the transverse pressure obtained from the field equations should not be considered typical of the cosmic fluid driving the accelerated expansion , as it is only a feature of these inhomogeneous vdw configurations .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the equation of state leading to the acceleration of the universe on large scales , is an average equation of state corresponding to a background fluid .",
    "so in the inhomogeneities giving rise to the configurations discussed in this work , it is also important to justify if one may really use an equation of state that in fact corresponds to a background fluid . for this , it is important to understand the evolution of structure formation in the vdw scheme .",
    "it was shown that for large redshifts the vdw model is similar to the @xmath9cdm model @xcite , where the vdw dark matter plays the role of a cosmological constant , showing that structure formation could evolve in a similar manner as in the @xmath9cdm model , although these points need to be further investigated  @xcite .",
    "now , it was also shown that due to a negative adiabatic sound speed , perturbations are unstable in the vdw quintessence scenario , and inevitably the role of anisotropic stresses and entropy production has to be taken into account .",
    "thus , as a first approximation and as a working hypothesis , one may argue that this also justifies the above approach of using an equation of state that corresponds to a background fluid , with a radial pressure .",
    "we shall denote these inhomogeneous spherically symmetric solutions as _ van der waals quintessence stars_. it is also interesting to note that the thermodynamic properties of a general relativistic isotropic pressure self - gravitating ball of fluid , undergoing a generic first order phase transition and governed by the vdw equation of state , was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    ", we shall generalize the latter to an anisotropic pressure general relativistic model , and we shall consider two specific class of solutions of vdw quintessence stars , namely , gravastars and traversable wormholes .",
    "the `` gravastar '' ( _ grav_itational _ va_cuum _ star _ ) picture developed by mazur and mottola @xcite , initially arouse from a considerable amount of scepticism related to spacetime singularities and event horizons in the schwarzschild black hole solution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on specific misconceptions and ambiguities related to these issues ) . in the gravastar model ,",
    "the interior schwarzschild solution is replaced with a de sitter condensate , and thus , does away with the problem of the singularity at the origin and the event horizon . in this model ,",
    "the quantum vacuum undergoes a phase transition at or near the location where the event horizon is expected to form . in this spirit , it is interesting to note that several models have been proposed to some extent in the literature @xcite .",
    "recently , motivated by dark energy quintessence , which is a possible candidate responsible for the late - time cosmic accelerated expansion , a generalization of the gravastar model has been proposed @xcite , by considering an interior solution governed by the dark energy equation of state , @xmath10 .",
    "stable dark energy stellar models were analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was found that large stability regions exist that are sufficiently close to where the event horizon is expected to form .",
    "it was also emphasized that it would be difficult to distinguish the exterior geometry of the dark energy stars from an astrophysical black hole . in this context , it is interesting to note that stars supported by a generalized chaplygin gas equation of state have been explored @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall also be interested in investigating the construction of traversable wormholes @xcite supported by the vdw equation of state .",
    "an analogous approach was recently carried out in the presence of phantom energy @xcite and the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "we will show that traversable wormhole solutions may be constructed using the vdw equation of state , which are either asymptotically flat or possess finite dimensions , where the exotic matter is confined to the throat neighborhood .",
    "the latter solutions are constructed by matching an interior wormhole geometry to an exterior schwarzschild vacuum .",
    "analogously to their phantom and chaplygin counterparts , these vdw quintessence wormholes have far - reaching astrophysical and cosmological consequences , such as the production of closed timelike curves and the consequent violation of causality .",

    "<S> the van der waals quintessence equation of state is an interesting scenario for describing the late universe , and seems to provide a solution to the puzzle of dark energy , without the presence of exotic fluids or modifications of the friedmann equations . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , the construction of inhomogeneous compact spheres supported by a van der waals equation of state is explored . </S>",
    "<S> these relativistic stellar configurations shall be denoted as _ van der waals quintessence stars_. despite of the fact that , in a cosmological context , the van der waals fluid is considered homogeneous , inhomogeneities may arise through gravitational instabilities . thus , these solutions may possibly originate from density fluctuations in the cosmological background . </S>",
    "<S> two specific classes of solutions , namely , gravastars and traversable wormholes are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> exact solutions are found , and their respective characteristics and physical properties are further explored . </S>"
