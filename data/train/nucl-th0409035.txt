    "another method is based on the analysis of x - ray spectra of antiprotonic atoms @xcite .    on the theoretical side",
    "the difference between the proton and neutron distributions can be obtained in the framework of hartree - fock ( hf ) method ( see for example @xcite ) or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "stable heavy nuclei exhibit an excess of neutrons over protons .",
    "a recent experiment at cern @xcite for charged pion production in the @xmath6 collision has observed an interesting dependence of the ratio @xmath7 on the feynman variable @xmath8 .",

    "it is often assumed that the dynamics of nuclear collisions is governed by the number of binary collisions @xcite .",
    "the number of binary n - n collisions at a given impact parameter is proportional to the nucleus - nucleus thickness @xmath14 in eq.([coll_thick ] ) we introduced @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the density function of the nucleus @xmath17 normalized to the number of nucleons .",
    "analogously the number of binary collisions of a given type in eq.([nn_scattering ] ) can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 where now @xmath20 and @xmath21 are nucleus thicknesses of protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "we have assumed one universal inelastic cross section @xmath22 .    as a second limiting case we consider the wounded nucleon model @xcite .",

    "eq.([wounded_nucleon_model ] ) is equivalent to eq.([nn_scattering ] ) with @xmath30 by construction , in our approach the numbers of wounded protons and neutrons reproduce the well known formula from @xcite for the number of wounded nucleons @xmath31 our construction requires also @xmath32 the fractions @xmath33 were estimated as @xmath34 which by construction fulfils ( [ n_wounded_fraction_sum ] ) .",

    "our approach explains the experimental data provided they are extremely peripheral .     as a function of impact parameter for the model with binary collision ( left panel ) and for the model with the scaling with number of wounded nucleons ( right panel ) for selected values of @xmath8 .",

    "it is known that the hijing code does not describe the @xmath0-@xmath1 asymmetry in elementary collisions in the region of large @xmath8 . in principle , instead of model calculations of the elementary cross sections one could use directly experimental data . using isospin symmetry and aproximate relations between elementary cross sections @xcite one can write for @xmath400.1 : @xmath41 } { r(x_f)[n_{pp}(b)+n_{pn}(b)]+n_{np}(b)+n_{nn}(b ) } \\ ; , \\label{experimental_r}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 we fit the na49 data shown in fig.2a of ref.@xcite with the simple form @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding results for @xmath44 are shown in fig.[fig_r_xf ] by the dashed lines .",
    "we find a good agreement with the calculations based on hijing below @xmath39 0.2 . above @xmath39 0.2 the results based directly on experimental data lay below those based on hijing .",
    "for completeness in fig.[fig_r_b ] we present the ratio @xmath37 as a function of the impact parameter @xmath38 for different values of @xmath8 .",
    "surprisingly the binary collision picture gives very similar results to the predictions of the wounded nucleon model .",
    "this suggests that a detailed comparison of model results with the well defined ( @xmath8 , @xmath38 ) experimental data could open a new possibility to study the neutron density profile .",
    "we expect that the na49 collaboration at cern will be able to gather the corresponding experimental data in the near future .",
    "can it provide a method competitive to that offered by proton - nucleus elastic scattering , antiprotonic atoms or parity violating electron scattering ?",
    "of course results of these methods must finally converge .",
    "therefore one may hope that together they will provide more reliable information on neutron distribution in nuclei ."
