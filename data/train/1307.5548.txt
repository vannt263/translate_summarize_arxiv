    "the researches studying nucleus - nucleus collisions at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern are mostly focused on the studies of hot and dense nuclear matter , which is created in collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei .",
    "this includes the search of signals of the phase transition between the hadronic matter and the quark - gluon phase which can be produced in collisions with small impact parameters .",
    "such central collisions are characterized by a large overlap of the volumes of colliding nuclei , their complete disintegration and very high multiplicities of produced secondary particles .",
    "the studies of collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei remain incomplete without exploring the domain of large impact parameters .",
    "there is another phenomenon which deserves attention there , namely , ultraperipheral interactions of nuclei which occur without any overlap of their volumes .",
    "the disintegration of nuclei in collisions with impact parameters @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the nuclear radii , can only be explained by the long - range electromagnetic forces .",
    "the impact of the coulomb field of a fast - moving nucleus with the charge @xmath5 on its collision partner can be estimated as following . providing that in the rest frame of the collision partner the moving nucleus has the lorentz factor @xmath6 , the lorentz - boosted coulomb potential at the moment of the closest approach can be estimated as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the fine structure constant .",
    "therefore , for collisions of medium - weight nuclei ( @xmath9 , @xmath10  fm ) with beam energies available at the cern sps the relation @xmath11 holds and @xmath12  gev .",
    "the estimated @xmath13 essentially exceeds the effective nuclear potential @xmath14 mev , which confines nucleons inside nuclei .",
    "this explains the emission of single nucleons from nuclei and their fragmentation as a result of electromagnetic interactions in ultraperipheral collisions .",
    "this phenomenon is well - known as electromagnetic dissociation ( emd ) of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of nuclear matter under the impact of strong electromagnetic fields can be studied in ultraperipheral collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei .",
    "the lorentz contraction of electromagnetic fields of nuclei in ultraperipheral nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc becomes tremendous .",
    "as demonstrated by recent measurements  @xcite , the total cross section of neutron emission from at least one of the colliding lead nuclei approaches 187  b at 1.38a  tev@xmath151.38a  tev collision energy . in this case",
    "the nucleus which impacts another nucleus via the action of its electromagnetic field is characterized by a large lorentz factor @xmath16 which defines the scale of contraction .",
    "as demonstrated in several publications , the emd process plays a certain role at the lhc . on the one hand",
    "a large emd cross section imposes restrictions on the beam lifetime at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "nuclear fragments produced in emd events can lead to local heating of the lhc construction elements  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the collider luminosity can be monitored  @xcite by counting mutual emd events characterized by the simultaneous emission of forward neutrons by each of the nuclei in a single ultraperipheral event .",
    "as suggested  @xcite , the rate @xmath17 of mutual emd events with the emission of either one or two neutrons in the directions of each beam should be measured at the lhc .",
    "this makes possible to measure the collider luminosity @xmath18 providing that the mutual emd cross section @xmath19 is calculated with sufficient accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the single and mutual emd neutron emission cross sections can be calculated with the reldis monte carlo model  @xcite , which is based on the weizcker - williams method  @xcite . in order to ensure the accuracy of this model for pb - pb collisions at the lhc ,",
    "its results were validated at lower collision energies . in particular ,",
    "we have measured the cross sections of forward neutron emission from 30a  gev lead nuclei in collisions with various target nuclei  @xcite .",
    "as proved by these measurements  @xcite , the cross sections of forward emission of one and two neutrons are well described by the reldis model . recently",
    "the single and mutual emd cross sections of neutron emission were measured at the lhc for pb - pb collisions at 1.38a  tev@xmath151.38a  tev  @xcite , and a very good agreement with the reldis results was demonstrated .    in the future",
    "the research programs at the cern - sps and lhc can be extended to study collisions of medium - weight nuclei .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to study the electromagnetic dissociation of indium nuclei in ultrarelativistic collisions with aluminum , copper , tin and lead target nuclei .",
    "the cross sections of forward emission of one , two and three neutrons by 158a  gev @xmath0 in nuclei are measured and compared to the corresponding results of the reldis model .",
    "the fragmentation of 158a  gev indium nuclei in collisions with si , ge , sn , w and pb was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by measuring the cross sections of production of secondary fragments with specific charge , also known as the charge - changing cross sections . since neither fragment masses , nor neutrons emitted from indium nuclei were identified in ref .",
    "@xcite , the measured cross sections represented the sum of hadronic fragmentation cross sections due to direct overlap of nuclei and fragmentation cross sections in ultraperipheral collisions .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , mainly the contribution of electromagnetic dissociation was identified in our experiment due to the detection of forward neutrons from indium nuclei , as explained below . in this sense",
    "our data complement the data collected in ref .",
    "@xcite and provide specific information on electromagnetic interactions of ultrarelativistic @xmath0 in nuclei .",
    "we consider now the neutron emission from indium nuclei resulting from electromagnetic and hadronic interactions of these nuclei with various targets .",
    "once theoretical models describing such processes are at hand , the relations between the cross sections of such processes can be estimated along with energy and angular distributions of produced neutrons .",
    "this helps in estimating the parameters of our experimental setup which is designed to detect such neutrons .",
    "the weizscker - williams method of virtual photons  @xcite is widely used to describe ultraperipheral interactions of nuclei . according to this method electromagnetic interactions of nuclei proceed by emission and absorption of virtual photons by these nuclei .",
    "the range of equivalent photon energies from the nucleon emission threshold @xmath20 to @xmath21  @xcite should be taken into account in order to describe the electromagnetic dissociation of nuclei . according to the threshold of @xmath22 reaction on @xmath0 in",
    ", @xmath23  mev was adopted in our calculations .",
    "the maximum photon energy @xmath24 depends on the sizes of colliding nuclei : @xmath25 and 2.36  gev for ultraperipheral interactions of 158a  gev @xmath0 in with al and pb nuclei , respectively . the equivalent photon spectrum calculated with various assumptions is given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the reldis model uses the monte carlo method to simulate emd events .",
    "this model is described in refs .",
    "the absorption and emission of one and two photons in a single ultraperipheral collision is taken into account , and the hadronic production of secondary particles in each collision is simulated by the monte carlo method .",
    "depending on the energy @xmath26 of a photon which is absorbed by a nucleus , various processes take place , namely , the excitation of a giant resonance in this nucleus , the absorption of the photon by a pair of bound nucleons or the production of hadrons on a bound nucleon .",
    "it is expected that the excitation and decay of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) at @xmath27  mev provides the main contribution to electromagnetic dissociation of indium nuclei .",
    "therefore , below we briefly review the modeling of the gdr excitation and decay within the reldis model .",
    "this process usually leads to the emission of one or two neutrons from in nucleus .",
    "the fission of in is not probable , and the cross section of emission of protons following the absorption of low - energy photons is also small due to a high coulomb barrier in this medium - weight nucleus .",
    "the total probability of photon absorption is calculated as an integral of the product of the equivalent photon spectrum and the total photoabsorption cross section  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the energy of a photon of @xmath27  mev is completely transformed into the excitation energy of the nucleus which absorbs this photon .",
    "the subsequent evolution of an excited nucleus is described by the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm )  @xcite , which is widely used to describe decays of excited nuclear systems .",
    "as predicted by the reldis model , the mean excitation energy of a medium - weight or heavy excited system , e.g. , in or pb , after the absorption of a photon is below 2 mev / nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the smm model predicts that the de - excitation of such systems proceeds via a sequential evaporation of nucleons .",
    "in particular , there is a competition between the emission of one and two neutrons in the gdr energy region , see fig .",
    "[ fig1:gin ] . as",
    "only neutrons were detected in experiments carried out in several laboratories  @xcite , @xmath28 and @xmath29 channels were not separated from @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",

    "the most reliable evaluated nuclear data on @xmath28 and @xmath29 cross sections on @xmath0 in were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite based both on theoretical results and measurements .",
    "the total photoabsorption cross section was estimated from measurements  @xcite , while the pre - equilibrium model of photonuclear reactions was used to disentangle the contributions of @xmath28 and @xmath29 processes .    in the reldis model the total photoabsorption cross section in the giant resonance region ( @xmath33  mev )",
    "is calculated according to the approximations found in refs .",
    "@xcite for various medium - weight and heavy target nuclei , including in .",
    "the relations between @xmath28 and @xmath29 channels are calculated by reldis from the statistical evaporation model . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1:gin ] , the experimental data on @xmath28 reaction on in collected at the livermore national laboratory  @xcite are described by reldis in general .",
    "however , the threshold of @xmath29 reaction is overestimated .",
    "nevertheless , the reldis results on @xmath29 reaction remain closer to livermore data  @xcite compared to other measurements  @xcite . at the same time on the right - hand side of the gdr resonance",
    "the reldis results on @xmath28 reaction are higher compared to the corresponding evaluated cross section data  @xcite .",
    "an opposite trend is seen for the evaluated @xmath29  @xcite cross section .",
    "it is higher compared to the same cross section calculated by reldis .",
    "neutrons emitted by excited ultrarelativistic nuclei created in ultraperipheral collisions have very forward angular distributions in the lab frame .",
    "this is because such neutrons have few mev kinetic energy and they are evaporated isotropically in the rest frame of the excited nucleus . after the lorentz boost from this system to the laboratory system such neutrons have velocities close to the velocity of the beam nuclei and they are characterized by small transverse momenta @xmath34 perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "distributions of @xmath34 for first and second neutrons emitted in electromagnetic dissociation of lead nuclei were calculated with reldis  @xcite .",
    "they have a maximum at @xmath35@xmath36  gev / c and a tail extending up to @xmath37  gev / c  @xcite .",
    "similar distributions , also restricted by @xmath38  gev / c , are calculated with reldis for 158a  gev @xmath0 in nuclei .",
    "they indicate that all emd neutrons are emitted within @xmath39  mrad angle with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the location of the neutron calorimeter ( 1350  cm downstream from the target ) and its transverse extensions ( @xmath403.5  cm at each direction perpendicular to the beam axis ) ensure the detection of all neutrons produced in emd of 158a  gev @xmath0 in nuclei , as a wider angle of @xmath41  mrad is covered by the detector .",
    "hadronic interactions of nuclei are characterized by strong interactions between participating nucleons in the overlapping parts of colliding nuclei .",
    "the abrasion - ablation model provides a simplified description of such collisions , and its modern version was already used to describe the fragmentation of lead nuclei  @xcite with the same ( 158 gev ) beam energy per nucleon as of indium beam in the present work .    following the abrasion - ablation model nucleons from colliding nuclei",
    "are classified into participants and spectators according to their role in the collision  @xcite .",
    "participant nucleons interact with nucleons from collision partner .",
    "spectator nucleons represent relatively cold spectator nuclear matter and do not interact with nucleons of collision partner at the first abrasion stage of the collision .",
    "the number of participant nucleons is calculated according to the glauber theory of multiple scattering .",
    "other details of the abrasion - ablation model used in the present work are given elsewhere  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite various methods to calculate the excitation energy of residual nuclei composed of spectator nucleons were presented",
    ". hereafter such nuclei are called prefragments . as shown  @xcite ,",
    "the excitation energy of a prefragment can be estimated as 1326  mev on average per each participant nucleon knocked out from the initial nucleus .",
    "excited prefragments decay at the ablation stage of the collision and their decays in most cases are simulated as evaporation of nucleons according to the above - mentioned statistical model smm  @xcite .",
    "neutrons are produced on both stages of interaction , but their kinematic characteristics are different .",
    "nucleons are knocked out from initial nuclei as a result of individual nucleon - nucleon collisions at the abrasion stage , and their emission is accompanied by production of secondary hadrons .",
    "the average transverse momentum of nucleons knocked out from nuclei is estimated as @xmath42  gev / c  @xcite , and it is essentially larger than the average transverse momentum of neutrons produced in electromagnetic dissociation of nuclei .",
    "however , neutrons emitted by excited prefragments at the ablation stage have a narrow @xmath34-distribution , similar to the distribution of neutrons from electromagnetic dissociation .",
    "such ablation neutrons can be also registered by the calorimeter used in the present work .",
    "hadronic nucleus - nucleus collisions lead to emission of various numbers of neutrons in each event .",
    "as expected , the average number of knocked out and emitted neutrons per event depends on the collision centrality , i.e. on the impact parameter @xmath43 . since the fragmentation events of indium nuclei which specifically lead to the emission of one , two and three neutrons is the main subject of our study , peripheral ( grazing ) nucleus - nucleus collisions with @xmath44 have to be considered .",
    "the number of participant nucleons in such peripheral collisions is small and such nucleons are mostly located in a thin surface layer of each nucleus .",
    "this explains the fact that the cross section of emission of a small number of nucleons amounts to a small fraction of the total fragmentation cross section .",
    "in addition to the direct knock - out of nucleons at the abrasion stage the evaporation of nucleons from excited residual nuclei takes place also at the ablation stage . in this case the events with emission of only few neutrons at the ablation stage are mostly classified as peripheral collisions characterized by relatively low excitation of spectator matter .    despite of the simplifications adopted in the above - described modeling of nucleus - nucleus collisions , a satisfactory agreement of calculated and measured yields of nuclear fragments",
    "can be expected . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this approach applied to peripheral collisions of 158a  gev lead nuclei with c , al , cu , sn and au successfully describes the yields of nuclear fragments which are close in mass and charge to projectile nuclei .",
    "such fragments are created after emitting a few nucleons , and the nucleon multiplicity in such reactions is accordingly described .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the abrasion - ablation model is also applicable to neutron emission by indium projectiles with the same beam energy per nucleon .    calculated cross sections of emission of one , two and three neutrons , possibly accompanied by other undetected particles , e.g. protons , are collected in table  [ table1:theory ] .",
    "the total emd and hadronic fragmentation cross sections are also given in this table .",
    "due to the presence of channels with emission of more than three neutrons in electromagnetic and hadronic interactions , the sum of 1nx , 2nx and 3nx cross sections is less than the corresponding total cross section .",
    "the sum of 1nx , 2nx and 3nx emd channels amounts to 87% of the total emd cross section , while the same channels of hadronic fragmentation provide only 68% of the total hadronic cross section .",
    ".calculated cross sections of emission of one , two and three neutrons and the total cross sections for electromagnetic dissociation and hadronic fragmentation of 158a  gev @xmath0 in on al , cu , sn and pb nuclei .",
    "results of the reldis and abrasion - ablation models are given for electromagnetic and hadronic interactions of nuclei . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ reldis_comparision ]    as seen from table  [ reldis_comparision ] , the measured cross sections of forward neutron emission in collisions of @xmath0 in with cu , sn and pb agree well with reldis taking into account the uncertainties of measurements listed in the table .",
    "however , the data for al for all neutron multiplicities are noticeably larger compared to reldis results for this target nucleus .    a convenient presentation of the data and calculations is given in fig .",
    "[ fig9:sigbyz2 ] , where all cross sections are divided by @xmath45 , the square of charge of target nuclei , and plotted as a function of @xmath5 . as expected , the spectrum of equivalent photons is approximately proportional to @xmath45 of the target nuclei ( al , cu , sn , or pb ) , which emit photons absorbed by @xmath0 in .",
    "this is illustrated by a flat dependence of reldis results divided by @xmath45 as a function of @xmath5 with its slight increase for lighter targets .",
    "this increase is explained by a wider range of impact parameters available in ultraperipheral collisions with light targets defined by @xmath46 , see sec .",
    "[ photonuclear ] .",
    "this provides higher @xmath24 for al and cu compared to pb target . despite of this peculiarity a flat dependence of @xmath47 serves as a clear indication of the electromagnetic nature of interactions .",

    "1n , 2n and 3n cross sections are shown by circles , squares and triangles , respectively .",

    "all values are divided by @xmath45 to demonstrate the characteristic dependence of the emd cross sections . ]    taking into account experimental uncertainties of the present data , @xmath47 for cu , sn and pb targets are consistent in general with a flat dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "however , the cross sections measured with al target are higher than calculated with reldis , and also a general descending trend of @xmath47 is obvious in fig .",
    "[ fig9:sigbyz2 ] . as follows from table  [ table1:theory ] , the cross sections of 1n , 2n and 3n emission in hadronic interactions of @xmath0 in with al are comparable to the corresponding emd cross sections .",
    "therefore , a noticeable contribution of hadronic events to the emission of forward neutrons by @xmath0 in in collisions with al is expected .",
    "apart of the emd process , one , two and three neutrons are also produced in peripheral grazing hadronic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "for a given projectile nucleus the cross section of grazing collisions is proportional to the area of a thin surface rim of the target nucleus : @xmath48 .",
    "this means that @xmath49 , and the descending trend which is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9:sigbyz2 ] due the presence of hadronic events is thus explained .",
    "the cross sections of emission of one , two and three forward neutrons in collisions of 158a  gev @xmath0 in projectiles with al , cu , sn and pb target nuclei are measured .",
    "the collected data are compared with the cross sections of neutron emission in electromagnetic dissociation of @xmath0 in calculated with the reldis model .",
    "the measured cross sections agree with the cross sections calculated by reldis for ultraperipheral collisions with cu , sn and pb targets within estimated uncertainties of the measurements .",
    "such systematic uncertainties stem from the corrections to raw data accounting for interactions of projectile nuclei and neutrons with target material and air .",
    "the validity of the reldis model for simulating electromagnetic dissociation of ultrarelativistic @xmath0 in nuclei is demonstrated .",
    "the measured cross sections are attributed mainly to the electromagnetic dissociation process , as their values divided by @xmath45 of the target nucleus demonstrate a weak dependence on @xmath5 . the excess of neutron emission cross section measured in in - al collisions with respect to calculated emd cross section indicates a noticeable contribution for grazing in - al collisions .",
    "this is in contrast to our previous experiment  @xcite conducted with 30a  gev @xmath1pb beam colliding with the same targets where the contribution of grazing collisions was found relatively small with respect to emd also for al target .    as demonstrated recently  @xcite , ultraperipheral collisions of lead nuclei followed by emission of forward neutrons play a certain role at the lhc collider due to their large cross sections . forward",
    "neutron emission can be used to monitor the lhc luminosity , providing that such cross sections are known with sufficient accuracy , e.g. , calculated with reldis .    as shown  @xcite , such cross sections",
    "are indeed reliably predicted by reldis , once this model has been previously validated by comparison with the data  @xcite also collected with ultrarelativistic pb projectiles , but at lower energies .",
    "our present results confirm the accuracy of reldis in describing the cross sections of forward neutron emission by medium - weight ultrarelativistic @xmath0 in nuclei .",
    "therefore , the reldis model can be also used to plan future experiments at the lhc , possibly with beams of medium - weigh nuclei , like @xmath0 in .",
