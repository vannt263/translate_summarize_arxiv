    "it is generally believed that a large group of msps contribute to the majority of gamma - ray emission of gcs @xcite . at the distance of several kpc ,",
    "the gamma - ray flux of an individual msp @xcite is usually inferior to the point - source sensitivity of fermi - lat and it can not be detected .",
    "hence the gamma - rays from gc are most likely contributed by an entire population of msps rather than a single one .",
    "the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ was launched on june 11 , 2008 @xcite and it scans the whole sky every three hours in survey mode . the lat onboard fermi satellite is a pair - production telescope designed to collect gamma - rays in the energy range from about 20 mev to above 500 gev with unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "it has been running over seven years and has revolutionized our understanding of the gamma - ray emission from the gcs . in 3fgl @xcite",

    "the changes included new pattern recognition algorithm in the tracker reconstruction , a clustering stage in the calorimeter reconstruction , better energy reconstruction , more gamma - ray events particularly in the low energy range and so on .",
    "motivated by such remarkable improvements , in this work we re - analyze the gc sample of @xcite to search for new gamma - ray emitters .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the data analysis ; in section 3 , we present the main results ; a summary with some discussions is given in section 4 .",
    "the data in our analysis was collected from august 8th , 2008 to august 27th , 2015 with energy range from 100 mev to 500 gev .",
    "we used the _ fermi science tools _",
    "version v10r0p5 package provided by the _ fermi science support center_. we chose the pass 8 data ( evclass = 128 & evtype = 3 ) and only used the events with zenith angles @xmath1 90@xmath2 to minimize the contamination from the earth limb .",
    "we used _ gtmktime _ to get high - quality data in the good time intervals with expression recommended by the lat team of ( data_qual@xmath30)&&(lat_config==1 ) . the instrumental response function ( irf )",
    "we adopted here is `` p8r2_source_v6 '' . to reduce the data ,",
    "we follow the data analysis thread provided by the _ fermi science support center_.      the events are selected from a 20@xmath420@xmath2 squared region of interest ( roi ) with centered coordinates listed table  [ para_source ] ( just for the sources with significant gamma - ray signal ) .",
    "we binned the data with 25 logarithmical energy bins with spatial pixel size of @xmath5 . using the binned maximum likelihood method , we modeled the events composed of all known sources included in 3fgl and two diffuse backgrounds in the field .",
    "the two background templates include galactic ( gll_iem_v06.fits ) and extragalactic ( iso_p8r2_source_v6_v06.txt ) diffuse emissions , and we kept normalizations of them as free parameters .",
    "the model file was generated with make3fglxml.py .",
    "we used a single power - law ( pl , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the normalization and @xmath8 is the photon spectral index ) or an exponential cut - off power - law ( ple , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the cut - off energy ) as the spectral model of gamma - ray gc candidates . within 5@xmath11 from the center of roi , the normalization and the spectral parameters of each source",
    "were set free . while for other sources located in the roi , we only free the normalization factors .",
    "@xcite carried out an systematic search of gamma - ray gcs .",
    "in addition to the discovery of a few gamma - ray emitters , they found 31 sources with weak signals . in this work ,",
    "we re - analyze these tentative sources and focus on five sources with test statistic ( ts ) values greater than 25 ( i.e. , the corresponding significance is @xmath12 , abdo et al .",
    "2010b ) and normal photon spectral indexes ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the ts value is defined as ts@xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the logarithmic maximum likelihood values of null hypothesis and tested model including the target source .",
    "we only find five candidates , including ngc 5904 , m 15 , ngc 6218 , ngc 6139 and ngc 6397 , for further analysis .",
    "we then use _ gttsmap _ to generate their @xmath17 residual ts maps ( see figure  [ tsmaps ] , each map is centered on the nominal position of the gc from simbad ) .",
    "the _ gttsmap _ removes all sources that within model file through a grid of locations on the sky and maximizing @xmath18 at each grid positions to identify weaker sources .",
    "we select events above 400 mev for the residual ts maps . in running _ gttsmap _ , we freeze all parameters of sources at the best - fit results of _ gtlike _ except the two diffuse backgrounds . in @xcite ,",
    "the source with a @xmath19 had been considered significantly curved , where @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 .",
    "but for the current five gcs we have @xmath22 .",
    "hence we use a power - law spectrum as the best - fit model for each gc ( note that we have also presented the ple result for ngc 5904 to compare with the result of @xcite ) .    using _ gtfindsrc _ we derive the positions of the gamma - ray sources , which are then found to be within the tidal radii of ngc 5904 , m 15 , ngc 6218 , ngc 6139 and ngc 6397 , respectively ( see fig.[tsmaps ] ) .",
    "the association of these five gamma - ray emitters , not included in 3fgl , with the gcs is established .",
    "following @xcite , we estimated the trial factor to avoid fake signal with a number of search positions . in these 31 gc candidates ,",
    "we try to search the gamma - ray emissions and only five of them are further analyzed in this work .",
    "so @xmath23 is 31 , and we use an averaged tidal radius @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is about 15 which is derived by dividing the trial factor area of gc into 0.1@xmath40.1@xmath2 pixel .",
    "our best - fit results are summarized in table [ para_spec ] with statistical errors only .",
    "finally we can get the post - trail significance ( see table [ para_spec ] ) .    to obtain the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with @xmath26 , we divided the energy range into equal logarithmic spaced energy bins of these five gcs . in this step ,",
    "we forze all spectral parameters . by fitting all model components , we got the flux of target source in each energy bin .",
    "we have also examined possible flux variability , in which all data were binned into 10 equal time bins . for each time bin",

    "_ , we also separate each data set into 10 equal time bins for searching the possible flux variability for these five globular clusters .",
    "no significant variability is obtained .",
    "this can be understood since msps are stable in timescales much longer than their rotation periods .",
    "@xcite reported a high significant gamma - ray pulsation from psr j1823 - 3021a in ngc 6624 .",
    "we also searched for the gamma - ray pulsation in ngc 5904 , m 15 and ngc 6397 with the radio pulsar ephemeris . using tool tempo2 @xcite which is not associated with the fssc , we fold the events from the three gcs on every known radio pulsar ephemeris .",
    "the events are assigned phases base on its arrival time to investigate a pulse profile .",
    "we do not find any evidence for the gamma - ray pulsation .",
    "this is natural since usually individual msp is too dim to be detected in gamma - ray band and the detected signal in each gc is most likely from a group of msps , for which the pulsation from individual msp is smeared .",
    "the detection prospect of gamma - ray emission from gcs depends on their gamma - ray luminosities ( i.e. the @xmath84 and gamma - ray efficiency ) as well as their locations .",
    "it is generally believed that @xmath85 correlates with the encounter rate @xmath86 , the metallicity [ fe / h ] @xcite , the number of msps , the shape of spectrum of source and the distance from us . in the inverse compton scattering model of gamma - ray gcs , @xmath85 is governed by the energy density of the soft - photon field at the cluster location ( see @xcite ) . to further check these possibilities",
    ", we have a plot ( i.e. , figure  [ plane ] ) following @xcite . the current five gamma - ray gcs fit in the fundamental - plane relationships suggested in @xcite",
    ". an improved sample of @xmath45-ray gcs can further test the correlation between the detected gamma - ray luminosities and other properties of gcs , which may shed additional light on the origin of gev gamma - ray photons .",
    "for example , the tendency that the gamma - ray luminosities increase with the energy densities of the soft photons , as shown in figure [ plane ] , is in support of the ic scattering mechanism @xcite .",
    "moreover , the locations of the gcs are important . the higher the galactic latitude , the lower the gamma - ray background .",
    "hence the sources at high galactic latitudes are more easily to identify .",
    "that is why the first group of gamma - ray gcs were identified at relatively high galactic latitudes while the sources to be discovered were mainly in the galactic plane .",
    "nevertheless , the gamma - ray gc sample is expected to grow up due to the continual successful operation of fermi - lat and the ongoing observation of dark matter particle explorer @xcite . with a significantly enhanced sample ,",
    "some fundamental differences between the gamma - ray gcs and non - detected ones , if there are , will be identified .",
