    "advanced - generation interferometric gravitational wave detectors , such as advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite and kagra @xcite are currently being commissioned .",
    "their sensitivity is expected to surpass that achieved by first generation instruments by almost an order of magnitude in the high frequency region . to achieve this , very high circulating power levels ( 0.5 - 1 mw )",
    "will be stored within the fabry - perot arm cavities . at these power levels , even low levels of optical absorption",
    "can lead to significant thermoelastic distortion of optical surfaces and unacceptable levels of wavefront distortion @xcite , resulting in reduced circulating power and a reduction in the efficiency of the detector signal readout .",
    "thermally actuated compensation systems will be thus used to ameliorate the wavefront distortion .",
    "however , the thermal time constants for the absorption - induced distortion and the compensation are long , typically 12 hours , and thus incorporating predictive modeling in the control systems may prove essential .",
    "the response of a linear elastic system to heating is described by the theory of thermo - elasticity and its applications to highly symmetric , idealized systems are described in many books ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "it has also been used to develop analytic expressions for less idealized optical systems @xcite .",
    "the expressions developed by hello and vinet @xcite are relevant to the work described here , but apply only to cylindrical isotropic mirrors heated by coaxial laser beams .",
    "more complicated systems , which incorporate asymmetric heating or anisotropic elasticity , can be investigated using finite - element numerical models that apply the equations of thermo - elasticity on a three - dimensional spatial mesh . for dynamic systems ,",
    "the thermoelastic equations must be solved at each epoch , requiring computational times that can run to many days .",
    "this approach would be untenable for use in predictive feed - forward actuation to control systems .",
    "in such cases , the solution of the scalar problem to determine the temperature profile throughout the optic can be solved rapidly ; the time consuming part is solving the tensor - based elasticity problem to convert the thermal profile into an elastic distortion .",
    "the betti - maxwell theorem of elastodynamic reciprocity @xcite provides an alternative approach to using finite - element methods ( fem ) to solve the tensor part of the thermoelastic distortion .",
    "it has previously been used to investigate the excitation of rayleigh - lamb elastic waves in a metal plate due to heating produced by a line - focused pulsed laser beam assuming that the heating is confined to the surface of the plate and it has infinite lateral extent @xcite . in the context of gravitational wave detection",
    ", it has been used to compute the interferometer s response to creep events in the fibers that suspend the optics @xcite .",
    "we extend its use to predict thermoelastic distortion of an optic of finite size with asymmetric heating .",
    "we describe here how elastodynamic reciprocity and fem can be combined to provide accurate predictions of thermoelastic surface distortion more quickly than using fem alone . in summary",
    ", fem is used to determine the response of the optic to a set of orthonormal tractions , or pressures a computationally expensive calculation that is performed once for an optic .",
    "then , using reciprocity , the distortion due to the instantaneous temperature profile in the optic is calculated using a sum of scalar volume integrals that incorporate these responses .",
    "the computational cost of this step is much less than that of a full elastostatic fem evaluation .",
    "additionally , it is amenable to parallelization , which would further reduce the computational time .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows : in section ii we introduce the betti - maxwell theorem of elastodynamics and show how it can be used to determine the surface distortion by careful choice of a suitable ` auxiliary ' elastic system .",
    "we demonstrate its application by calculating the distortion of the end face of a cylindrical optic that is heated by a gaussian heat flux that is ( a ) coaxial with and ( b ) laterally displaced from the axis .",
    "the approach and model are described in sections iii and iv .",
    "finally , the resulting surface distortions are presented in section v and compared with the results of elastostatic fem calculations .",
    "computation times for these two approaches are compared in section vi",
    "the betti - maxwell reciprocity theorem for elastodynamics @xcite specifies the relationship between the displacement @xmath0 that results from an applied surface traction @xmath1 and internal body force @xmath2 for two elastic states of a linear elastic body :    @xmath3dv \\label{equation1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the density , @xmath5 is acceleration , the superscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the two states , and the einstein summation convention is us    ed . if @xmath8 and @xmath9 then @xmath10 , and thus eq .",
    "( [ equation1 ] ) becomes    @xmath11    we shall use this theorem to determine the surface displacement ( distortion ) due to heating of an optic by , for example , partial absorption of an incident laser beam . for the first state , which we shall refer to as the `` thermal state '' and label @xmath12 , we assume that the optic is free and thus @xmath13 , and there is a non - zero body force due to the heating .",
    "since we are interested in the distortion of the end face of the optic , we choose the second state , which is often referred to as the `` auxiliary state '' and we shall label @xmath14 , to have a traction @xmath15 applied to the end face of the optic and assume @xmath16 .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ equation2 ] ) becomes    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the internal strain produced by the traction @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the internal stress associated with the body force : @xmath21 .",
    "consider now applying time - harmonic tractions with amplitude @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "it is convenient to choose @xmath24 to be orthonormal , so that @xmath25 . then , expressing the surface displacement amplitude as :    @xmath26    transforms the left - hand term of eq .",

    "( [ equation4 ] ) and ( [ equation6 ] ) .",
    "we shall use this approach to calculate the surface distortion due to non - uniform heating of a homogeneous isotropic body for which    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is young s modulus , @xmath34 is the coefficient of thermal expansion , @xmath35 is poisson s ratio , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the ambient temperature .",
    ". [ equation6 ] thus becomes    @xmath38",
    "to determine the distortion of the end - face using reciprocity , one must first characterize the response of the elastic system , @xmath18 , to a set of orthonormal basis tractions @xmath39}:n = 1 , .... , n$ ] using an elastostatic fem [ 11 ] .",
    "zernike functions would be a tempting choice given our cylindrical geometry , particularly as they are orthogonal to a uniform traction and thus applying the auxiliary tractions should not apply net forces to the system .",
    "however , as shown in section iv , they are not well suited to describing the surface distortion .",
    "the orthonormal basis tractions we shall use apply a non - zero ( instantaneous ) force to the optic , leading to ill - conditioning of the fem at very low frequencies . we thus used a traction frequency of @xmath40 hz as the response is independent of frequency for frequencies well below the first resonance - see [ 12 ] for example .    in all of our numerical tests , we assume a cylindrical fused silica optic with height @xmath41 200 mm , radius @xmath42 170 mm , @xmath43 mpa , @xmath44 and @xmath45 k^-1^ .",

    "[ equation8 ] .",
    "choosing a set of orthonormal functions @xmath30 that can describe the surface distortion without requiring a large number of functions , which would necessarily include high spatial frequencies , is crucial as it reduces both the number of auxiliary tractions that must be evaluated and the requirement for using a fine mesh in the fem .",
    "thus , we describe the choice of basis functions for on - axis and off - axis heating of the optic .",
    "zernike polynomials ( see appendix a ) are often used to describe cylindrically symmetric optical aberrations , as they are orthogonal over a circular disc and can be normalized",
    ". however , as shown in figure [ figure2 ] , these polynomials are not well suited to describing the distortion .     , the sum of the first six zernike components @xmath52 , and the sum of the first six orthonormalized lg components @xmath53    on - axis surface distortion due to the heating can also be described using laguerre - gauss ( lg ) functions : @xmath54 % \\label{equationlg}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 are laguerre polynomials of order @xmath56 ( see appendix a ) , @xmath57    is the radial coordinate and @xmath58 is a free parameter .",
    "these functions are orthogonal only over the infinite plane however .",
    "symmetric orthogonalization @xcite is therefore used , as outlined in appendix b , to construct linear combinations , @xmath59 , of lg functions that are orthonormal over the end face for a given @xmath58 . in this type of orthogonalization",

    "the six lowest - order orthonomalized - lg functions are defined in appendix d. a comparison of @xmath61 and the sum of these components in fig . [ figure2 ] shows that the lg basis is much superior to the zernike basis .",
    "the distortion due to off - axis heating can be described using the sets of functions listed below :    \\(a ) hermite - gauss ( hg ) functions : @xmath62 h_n \\big ( \\frac{\\sqrt{2 } y}{r_{0y}}\\big ) \\exp \\big[\\frac{-y^2}{r_{0y}^2}\\big ] % \\label{equationhg}\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 are the ( `` physicists '' ) hermite polynomials of order @xmath64 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "these functions are orthogonal over the interval @xmath65 .",
    "we choose @xmath66 as the heat flux has a circular cross section and we shall use @xmath67 , and thus    @xmath68    \\(b ) generalized lg functions :    @xmath69   \\begin{cases } 1   \\\\ \\sin{l \\phi } \\\\ \\cos{l \\phi }   \\end{cases } % \\label{lglp}\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 is the azimuthal angle , and @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "we restricted the azimuthal dependence to @xmath73 due to the symmetry of the expected distortion .",
    "orthonormalized hg and generalized - lg functions were constructed , and an optimized value of @xmath74 was selected as discussed above .",
    "hg functions up to @xmath75 ( 136 functions in total ) were initially used to describe the distortion due to a heating beam that was displaced from the center of the optic according to @xmath76(0,10 mm ) , ( 10 mm , 0 ) and ( 8.7 mm , 5 mm ) .    in each case , the distortion was dominated by the same 17 components , the functions for which are plotted in appendix e. a comparison of @xmath61 and the sum of the dominant 19 components is shown in fig .",

    "in addition , since the lower order orthonormalized - hg functions appear similar to the tem@xmath79 and tem@xmath80 eigenmodes observed in optical cavities , we chose to use that basis .",
    "we now show how to use the orthonormal bases described above with reciprocity to determine the surface distortion . in each case",

    "while zernike polynomials are not appropriate for describing the surface distortion in the example presented here , they can be used for a reciprocity - based calculation .",
