    "cold molecules , with translational temperatures at or below 100 mk , are strongly subject to control over their behavior , and may afford unprecedented opportunities for probing chemistry as a function of initial conditions to reaction  @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath0k samples of krb molecules have been formed  @xcite and their reactions probed for different temperatures  @xcite , electric fields  @xcite and dimensional confinements  @xcite .",
    "these molecules have appreciable electric dipole moments , so manipulation of their collisions arises from their comparatively strong dipolar interactions .    more broadly , open - shell radicals can also be produced at low temperatures , albeit in samples not quite as cold .",
    "examples include @xmath1 molecules such as srf  @xcite or @xmath2 molecules such as oh  @xcite .",
    "in addition to being of arguably greater chemical interest , these species present the possibility of simultaneous control by acting on their magnetic , as well as electric , dipole moments .",
    "the simultaneous action of electric and magnetic fields has been considered previously in the context of buffer - gas - cooled species , considering collisions such as he + cad and he + nd  @xcite or he + ybf  @xcite . for certain radicals , such as oh , o@xmath3 and nh ,",
    "molecule - molecule collisions have been considered in the presence of either electic  @xcite or magnetic  @xcite fields but not , to our knowledge , both simultaneously .",
    "here we consider the effect of both electric and magnetic fields on collisions of the oh radical , at collision energies ranging from 1@xmath0k to 50 mk . in its ground electronic state , this molecule possesses a magnetic dipole moment of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the bohr magneton ) and an electric dipole moment of @xmath6  d. thus at the temperatures considered , long - range electric dipole forces generate interaction energies that can exceed translational temperatures when the molecules are hundreds of bohr radii apart .",
    "this circumstance implies that electric and magnetic fields act on the molecules primarily on this distance scale , and that theoretical models focusing on this long - range physics are adequate to see the effect of the fields . from this standpoint",
    ", it has already been noted that electric fields tend to _ increase _ the rate of state - changing collisions of oh molecules  @xcite , while magnetic fields tend to _ decrease _ these rates  @xcite . if both types of field are present , they are therefore in competition , promising additional opportunities for manipulation of collisions",
    ". in particular , the angle between the fields , at the site of a collision , can be decisive in determining the collision s outcome .",
    "the emphasis on long - range physics is assisted by the special characteristics of @xmath2 molecules such as oh . for @xmath7 molecules , the electric dipole moment",
    "is induced by the mixing of the ground and the excited rotational states by an electric field .",
    "the rotational constant is on the order of mk so the ground and higher excited rotational levels can not be treated independently , while for oh molecules the large rotation splitting implies small mixing of higher - lying rotational states at modest electric fields .",
    "a signature of this feature is the protection of certain low field seeking states of cold oh molecules in a magnetic field , leading to high elastic collisions compared to inelastic collisions , stemming from a strong repulsive van der waals coefficient  @xcite . because of this repulsion",
    ", the oh molecules in those states are expected to be shielded from chemical reactions at sufficiently low temperature .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the scattering of polar molecules when arbitrary combined electric and magnetic fields are applied ( parallel as well as non - parallel fields ) , taking the oh molecule as an example .",
    "this study is the starting point to more complicated dynamics of polar molecules in a quadrupole magnetic trap in a presence of an electric field as performed in ongoing experiments  @xcite , where collisions of molecules will occur at different electric and magnetic field configurations for different positions in the trap .",
    "these collisions are also important to determine new efficient evaporative cooling schemes , for example using appropriate electric and magnetic field trap combinations , to further cool down molecular dipolar gases .",
    "if quantum degenerate gases are finally produced , the combined electric and magnetic fields can be used as additional tools to control and probe the many - body physics of electric and magnetic dipolar systems  @xcite .",

    "the next rotational level @xmath24 is @xmath25  k higher than the @xmath26 state so the oh ground rotational state is well - separated from all its higher excited states , and will be ignored in the rest of the study considering the low collision energy range of the molecules .    in hund s case ( a ) , the magnetic dipole moment",
