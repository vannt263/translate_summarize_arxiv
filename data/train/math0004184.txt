    "in this paper we study the navier - stokes equation driven by heat conduction . under a large aspect ratio assumption ( the spatial domain being a thin layer )",
    "we prove the existence of a global strong solution .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath3 is the width / height ratio of the experimental apparatus and @xmath4 is considered large , see hu et al .",
    "for existence results for the navier - stokes equation in thin domains we particularly refer to raugel @xcite and the references therein .",
    "our contribution is the addition of a heat equation where the heat conduction is driving the fluid .",
    "the prototype we have in mind is the classical bnard problem and this work is motivated by the instabilities of roll - patterns observed in experiments and simulations .",
    "rayleigh - bnard convection is a model for pattern formation and has been extensively studied , busse and clever @xcite established the stability of straight parallel convection rolls and used them to explain many experimental observations , for large prandtl numbers @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath7 is the thermal diffusitivity ) . for low prandtl numbers , the situation is much more complicated and it has long been recognized @xcite that mean flows are crucial in understanding the complex pattern dynamics observed in experiments . in this paper",
    "we establish that this complexity is not caused by singularity formation but our ultimate goal is a theoretical understanding and a quantitative capture of the mean flow . it is known that wave - number distortion , roll curvature and the mean flow make straight convection rolls become unstable @xcite .",
    "these effects have been successfully modelled by decker and pesch @xcite and simulated .",
    "however , the resulting equations contain non - local terms due to the mean - flow and are theoretically intractable .",
    "it is our hope that our results will put the study of the contribution of the mean flow on a rigorous mathematical footing , both simplifying and reaching a better theoretical understanding in the process .",
    "the experimental difficulties of measuring weak global flow in the presence of dominant local roll circulations are formidable , @xcite , and a theoretical insight may be crucial in the case of dynamical patterns .    as a preparation , we prove a new statement of the classical , see leray @xcite , existence of a global strong solution and a global attractor for the three - dimensional navier - stokes equation under smallness assumptions on the data , see ladyshenskaya @xcite . for different results with large forcing compare foias and temam @xcite and",
    "sell @xcite .",
    "this new statement and new proof of the theorem are crucial in the statement and the proof of the existence of a global solutions of the rayleigh - bnard problem with a large aspect ratio .",
    "the existence is proven after an initial time - interval , corresponding to a settling - down period in experiments . in experiments in gases ( @xmath8 )",
    "this settling - down time is a few hours for experiments that take a few days , @xcite .",
    "we will also prove that the rayleigh - bnard problem has a global attractor .",
    "then theorems of milnor @xcite , birnir and grauer @xcite , and birnir @xcite are used to prove that the rayleigh - bnard problem has a unique maximal b - attractor .",
    "this attractor has the property that every point attracts a set ( of functions ) that is not shy @xcite , or of positive infinite - dimensional measure .",
    "the discovery of a spiral - defect chaotic attractor @xcite , in a parameter region were previously only straight rolls were known to be stable @xcite , was one of the more startling results in recent pattern formation theory .",
    "the experimentally observed attractors are b - attractors , and the spiral - defect chaotic attractor and the straight roll attractor may be two minimal b - attractors of the unique maximal b - attractor whose existence we prove .",
    "we start with the boussinesq equations which are two coupled equations for the fluid velocity @xmath9 , the pressure @xmath10 and the temperature @xmath11 , @xmath12 { \\displaystyle}{{{\\partial}{t}\\over{\\partial}{t}}+(u\\cdot{\\nabla})t-\\kappa\\delta{t } = 0,}\\\\[2ex ] { \\rm div}\\,u = 0 ,   \\end{array } \\right.\\;\\;x\\in{\\omega},\\;t\\in{\\bf r}^+.\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath14 is the volume expansion coefficient of the fluid .",
    "moreover @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the viscosity and conductivity coefficients which determine the dimensionless rayleigh @xmath15 and prandtl numbers .",
    "we assume that @xmath16 is a rectangular box and fix the temperatures at the bottom @xmath17 and top @xmath18 of the box .",
    "the box is heated from below so @xmath19 .",
    "we can impose periodic boundary conditions for @xmath9 on the lateral sides of the box .",

    "the velocity is assumed to vanish on the horizontal surfaces of the box .",
    "finally , we must supply the appropriate initial data .",
    "the mathematical framework for the homogenization starts by the introduction of a ( small ) parameter @xmath20 and a scaling of the navier - stokes system above @xmath21 { \\displaystyle}{{{\\partial}{t_{\\epsilon}}\\over{\\partial}{t}}+(u_{\\epsilon}\\cdot{\\nabla})t_{\\epsilon}-{\\epsilon}^{3/2 } \\kappa\\delta{t_{\\epsilon } } = 0,}\\\\[2ex ] { \\rm div}\\,u_{\\epsilon}= 0 ,   \\end{array } \\right.\\;\\;x\\in{\\omega},\\;t\\in{\\bf r}^+.\\ ] ] the bulk of the paper will be devoted to proving that there exist unique functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 such that @xmath24 as @xmath25 in the appropriate sobolev spaces . at a first glance , sending @xmath26 to zero seems to give the euler equation , but this is wrong .",
    "the limit obtained is viscid and the above equation only makes sense for @xmath20 .",
    "however , for any fixed @xmath20 the solutions of the scaled equations have global existence in two dimensions and the equations possess a smooth global attractor in dimensions two or three , see foias et al .",
    "@xcite , ladyshenskaya @xcite and sell @xcite .",

    "the initial data is so highly oscillatory that we can assume that the boundary conditions are periodic in the local variable @xmath35 .",
    "the navier - stokes system ( 1.3 ) differs from the original system ( 1.2 ) in that it has an additional forcing term @xmath36 .",
    "this is the obvious influence of the global pressure on the local flow .",
    "the solutions of the system ( 1.3 ) enjoy global ( in @xmath37 ) existence in two dimensions and the equations possess a smooth ( in @xmath35 ) global attractor in dimensions two or three .",
    "this , possibly high - dimensional , attractor of the local flow is the physically relevant quantity for the local flow , except in the strong turbulence limit , when long transients may play a role .",
    "we will show that the solution of ( 1.3 ) is the unique two - scales limit of a sequence of solutions to the scaled system ( 1.2 ) .",
    "this uses the weak sequential compactness property of reflexive banach spaces and says that any bounded sequence @xmath38 in say @xmath39 contains a subsequence , still denoted by @xmath38 , such that for smooth test functions @xmath40 , periodic in @xmath35 @xmath41 the main result ( theorem 7.1 ) is that if @xmath38 is a sequence of solutions to the navier - stokes system ( 1.2 ) , then the so called two - scales limit @xmath42 is the solution to the local navier - stokes system ( 1.3 ) .",
    "our proof is based upon a compactness result which was first proved by nguetseng @xcite and then further developed by allaire @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath42 is a globally defined unique solution of the system ( 1.3 ) , which is the case if @xmath42 lies on the attractor of ( 1.3 ) , then , by uniqueness , the whole sequence @xmath38 two - scale converges to @xmath42 .",
    "the mean field turns out to be @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , is the unit vector in the vertical direction and @xmath46 denotes the projection onto the divergence free part of @xmath47 , @xmath48 the mean field is derived from the local navier - stokes system ( 1.3 ) .",
    "it gives the contribution of the conduction to the small scale flow .",
    "we have averaged ( in @xmath35 ) , denoted by overbar , over the unit cell @xmath34 , @xmath45 .",
    "once we have the local problem ( 4.3 ) the boundary conditions on the local cell can also be relaxed to capture the contribution of ( global ) convection to the mean field . the mean field with the influence of the convection taken into account , turns out not surprisingly to satisfy a forced euler s equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with @xmath52 .",
    "we let @xmath16 be a rectangular box , of thickness @xmath53 and lebesgue measure @xmath54 , in @xmath55 , @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "by @xmath58 , @xmath59 or @xmath60 , we denote the canonical basis in @xmath61 or @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the system ( 1.2 ) is equipped with the following initial data : @xmath63 which are assumed to belong to @xmath39 , and boundary data : @xmath64 as above @xmath65 moreover we assume that @xmath66 are periodic with period @xmath67 in the horizontal @xmath68-direction , in the two - dimensional case and periodic with period @xmath67 in the horizontal @xmath68-direction and period @xmath69 in the @xmath70-direction in the three - dimensional case .",
    "in fact we will without loss of generality assume that @xmath71 throughout the paper .",
    "this determines the pressure @xmath10 up to a constant that can be fixed by normalization , see remark 2 .",
    "since we are interested in the fluctuations in the temperature we follow @xcite and put @xmath72 and @xmath73    we get the following system which is equivalent to ( [ eq : bouss ] ) . @xmath74",

    "we are left with @xmath100 the schwarz and poincar inequalities give @xmath101 of @xmath94 , gives @xmath97 next we integrate the inequality @xmath102 by ( 2.2 ) we get @xmath103 finally , we let @xmath104 , and choose @xmath105 sufficiently large to get @xmath106 this implies that there is a set of positive lebesgue measure in every interval @xmath107 $ ] such that @xmath108 for @xmath105 in this set .",
    "we continue by stating a local existence theorem .",
    "suppose that the pressure is normalized , i.e. , @xmath109 then there exists a unique local solution @xmath110 of ( 2.1 ) in @xmath111;(h^1({\\omega}))^{n+1})$ ] , @xmath112 , with initial data @xmath113 in @xmath114 .",
    "the local existence time @xmath105 depends only on the @xmath115-norms of @xmath116 .",
    "kreiss and lorentz @xcite can be consulted for details of the proof .",
    "it is well - known that global solutions of the navier - stokes equations exist , @xmath117 , in two dimensions . in three dimensions that analogous statement",
    "however , if transients are allowed to settle for a sufficiently long time , then global solutions exist in three dimensions , after this settling of the initial velocity .",
    "we now state and prove a result saying that every weak global solution to the three - dimensional navier - stokes equation becomes a strong solution after some finite time @xmath118 .",
    "this also goes back to leray @xcite .",
    "the existence of a global attractor is due to ladyshenskaya @xcite and more recently temam @xcite , sell @xcite and p. l. lions @xcite .",
    "both the statement and the proof of theorem 2.2 below are new and they are crucial in the statement and proof of the new existence theorem 3.3 below , for the rayleigh - bnard problem in the large aspect ratio .",
    "consider the three - dimensional navier - stokes equation ( 2.1 ) .",
    "for every weak solution @xmath119 to ( 2.1 ) there exists a @xmath120 , such that if the forcing @xmath121 is sufficiently small there exists a unique strong solution @xmath122 to ( 2.1 ) , with data @xmath123 . moreover , ( 2.1 ) possesses a global attractor .",
    "if the initial data @xmath124 is small , then the solutions have global existence , i.e. @xmath125 .    the subscript @xmath126 indicates that the solutions are only weakly continuos in @xmath105 .",
    "we take the inner product of ( 2.1 ) with @xmath127 and integrate over @xmath16 . using schwarz s inequality",
    "we obtain @xmath128 @xmath129 now @xmath130 by the gagliardo - nirenberg inequalities , where @xmath131 is a constant",
    ". thus , @xmath132 an application of the inequality @xmath133 , on the right hand side , gives @xmath134 @xmath135 by another application of the inequality above with @xmath136 . from lemma 2.1",
    "we get , again by the same inequality , @xmath137 adding these inequalities , applying the sobolev inequality and repeating the use of the inequality above results in @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are constants . using poincar s inequality and lemma 2.1",
    "we find that @xmath141 @xmath142 since @xmath143 now the point is that if the coefficient @xmath144 is small , or the forcing is small and we have waited a sufficiently long time , to let the initial data @xmath145 decay , then the inequality gives us a bound on @xmath146 .",
    "the argument is as follows .",
    "we integrate the inequality above over @xmath147 $ ] to get @xmath148 @xmath149 where @xmath150 .",
    "now assume that @xmath151 assumes its maximum in the interval @xmath147 $ ] at @xmath152 .",
    "then @xmath153 @xmath154 now put @xmath155 and @xmath156 then the inequality above can be written as @xmath157        the graph of the function @xmath158 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is concave and attains its maximum at @xmath159 . by lemma 2.1",
    "there exists a @xmath160 such that @xmath161 and we can choose @xmath121 so small that @xmath162 lies between zero and @xmath163 , see figure 1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath164 can never reach @xmath163 , because @xmath165 it is clear that we can choose @xmath166 so large that @xmath167 @xmath168 in figure 1 is positive at the point , where @xmath169 first reaches @xmath170 , i.e. , @xmath171 which gives the bound @xmath172 where @xmath173 is arbitrarily small .",
    "the only question left is whether the initial data makes sense as a function in @xmath83 .",
    "but we have already used above that , by lemma 2.1 , there exists a sequence @xmath98 such that @xmath174 .",
    "we now choose the initial time to be the smallest @xmath175 .",
    "then we let this @xmath176 be the new @xmath166 .",
    "now we apply the local existence theorem 2.1 and the above bound to get global existence .",
    "we recall the definition of an absorbing set from coddington and levinson @xcite .",
    "a set @xmath177 is an absorbing set if for every bounded set @xmath170 there exists a time @xmath178 such that @xmath179 implies that @xmath180 , if @xmath181 .",
    "the estimate in lemma 2.1 shows that the weak - flow of the weak solution of the navier - stokes equations has an absorbing set in @xmath115 .",
    "but we have shown in addition that there exists a @xmath182 such that the flow is a continuos flow of strong solutions for @xmath183 and has the absorbing set @xmath184 . moreover , since @xmath83 is compactly embedded in @xmath39 it follows that the navier - stokes equation has a global attractor in @xmath39 .",
    "in fact one can now show , see @xcite , that the solutions are spatially smooth and thus @xmath185 .",
    "it follows , see hale @xcite , babin and vishik @xcite , temam @xcite and birnir and grauer @xcite , that the navier - stokes equation has a global attractor consisting of spatially smooth solutions .",
    "it is also clear that if @xmath124 is small then @xmath164 satisfies the above bound and the solutions have global existence for @xmath125 .",
    "the statement of theorem 2.2 is really just a restatement of leray s classical result of global existence for small initial data .",
    "the duality in the smallness condition is that one can either take small initial data or , with arbitrary initial data , just wait for a sufficiently long time .",
    "this statement is what most physicist and engineers are interested in , at least for low reynolds numbers .",
    "namely , transients die out and the flow settles down to the flow on the attractor in at most a few hours , in experiments , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the existence of the pressure term follows from a standard orthogonality argument which we present below .",
    "consider the navier - stokes equation ( [ eq : bouss ] ) and the solution given by theorem 2.2 .",
    "we take the inner product by @xmath9 , integrate over @xmath16 , apply the divergence theorem , use the incompressibility and collect all terms on one side .",
    "this gives @xmath186 now we recall that the orthogonal to the divergence free elements in @xmath115 are gradients in @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , there exists a unique gradient @xmath187 in @xmath39 given by @xmath188    we say that a set @xmath170 is _ invariant _ under the flow , defined by a nonlinear semi - group @xmath189 , if @xmath190 , i.e. @xmath170 is both positively and negatively invariant",

    "but we have not explained what the semi - group is that shrinks bounded sets onto the attractor .",
    "it is possible to define a semi - group on the space of weak - solutions , see sell @xcite , but in light of theorem 2.2 we can do much better .",
    "namely , a bounded subset of a banach space is a complete metric space and we have shown that for every bounded set @xmath197 eventually the solution starting in @xmath170 will lie in an absorbing set @xmath185 .",

    "the dimension estimates are however large , see @xcite , and not necessarily a good indication of the size of the attractor .",

    "we multiply each of these terms by the smooth compactly supported test function @xmath466 . for the time derivative we get ( recall that @xmath33 ) @xmath467 sending @xmath25 and integrating by parts yield , @xmath468 for the second ( inertial ) term we consider @xmath469 \\varphi(x,{x\\over { \\epsilon}},\\tau)dxd\\tau\\ ] ] @xmath470 \\varphi(x,{x\\over { \\epsilon}},\\tau)dxd\\tau.\\ ] ] by considering @xmath471 to be a test function in the second term on the right hand side this term immediately passes to zero in the two - scale sense . for the first term the schwarz s inequality yields @xmath472 @xmath473 @xmath474 where all the norms are in @xmath475;l^2({\\omega}))}$ ] . in order to pass to the limit in the right hand side we consider the usual @xmath115-mollifications @xmath476 and @xmath477 of @xmath478 and @xmath479 , respectively .",
    "since the mollified functions pass strongly to @xmath478 and @xmath479 , respectively , as @xmath480 , we have , for @xmath213 sufficiently small , say @xmath481 and for every @xmath35 in @xmath34 @xmath482 where @xmath173 is arbitrarily small , independently of @xmath26 .",
    "this inequality still holds true if we take the supremum in @xmath35 over @xmath34 .",
    "thus , for every @xmath481 , the right hand side will tend to zero as @xmath26 tends to @xmath483 , by the uniqueness of the two - scale limit @xmath484 of @xmath478 .",
    "consequently , we have proved that @xmath485 in the two - scale sense . for the third term",
    "we get , by the divergence theorem , @xmath486 @xmath487 sending @xmath25 yields , after applying the divergence theorem again , @xmath488 for the right hand side we immediately get @xmath489 for the fourth term ( the pressure ) we have to be a bit more careful .",
    "let us multiply the first equation of ( 4.2 ) by @xmath490 .",
    "for the pressure term we get @xmath491 a passage to the limit , and an application of the divergence theorem , using the fact that all other terms vanish , gives @xmath492 which implies that @xmath356 does not depend on @xmath35 .",
    "we now add the local incompressibility assumption on the test functions @xmath493 , i.e. @xmath494 and multiply the pressure term by @xmath495 and apply the divergence theorem , @xmath496 a passage to the limit , and an application of the divergence theorem , gives @xmath497    collecting all two - scale limits on the right hand side gives @xmath498 since @xmath494 we can argue as in remark 2 and conclude that there exists a local pressure gradient @xmath499 given by @xmath500 let us now consider the second equation of ( 4.2 ) .",
    "we already know that the sequence @xmath464 is uniformly bounded in @xmath238;l^2({\\omega}))$ ] .",
    "we multiply by @xmath501 as above and for the time derivative we get @xmath502 by letting @xmath503 we get @xmath504 for the non - linear term we have @xmath505 @xmath506 the first term on the right hand side immediately passes to zero . for the second term we argue as above and consider the difference",
    "@xmath507 @xmath508 @xmath509 by considering @xmath510 to be a test function in the second term , this term immediately passes to zero in the two - scale sense .",
    "for the first term we get , by the schwarz s inequality , @xmath511 where the norm is in @xmath475;l^2({\\omega}))}$ ] .",
    "we introduce , as above , mollifiers and consider the sequence @xmath512 which converges to @xmath513 strongly as @xmath480 . arguing as above , we choose @xmath213 sufficiently small to get @xmath514 where @xmath173 is arbitrarily small .",
    "thus , by sending @xmath25 , @xmath515 in the two - scale sense . for the third term",
    "we get , by the divergence theorem , @xmath516 @xmath517 we let @xmath25 and get , by the divergence theorem , @xmath518 the right hand side of the second equation in ( 4.2 ) will vanish since @xmath332 is of order @xmath519 . by theorem 4.2 the system ( 4.3 )",
    "has a unique solution @xmath520 and , thus , by uniqueness , ( 4.3 ) is two scales homogenized limit of the system ( 2.1 ) .",
    "also , by uniqueness , the whole sequence converges to its two - scale limit and the theorem is proven .",
    "in this section we derive the mean field @xmath521 for the velocity .",
    "let us consider the first equation of ( 4.3 ) @xmath522 { { \\displaystyle}{\\rm div_y}u_0 = 0,\\;\\;{\\rm div_x}(\\int_{t^n}\\,u_0\\,dy ) = 0 } ,   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] in @xmath523 with @xmath34-periodicity as boundary data in @xmath35 .",
    "now , by the decay of the heat kernel , for @xmath37 sufficiently large , the first term becomes arbitrarily small .",
    "an averaging of the second term over @xmath34 in @xmath35 gives @xmath528 the divergence theorem gives @xmath529 where @xmath530 is the local unit normal and @xmath531 the local surface element .",
    "now , by the local incompressibility we get @xmath532 moreover , for the boundary integral we get , in the two - dimensional case , @xmath533 @xmath534 by the @xmath535-periodicity of @xmath536 .",
    "consequently @xmath537 the computation in the three - dimensional case is similar .",
    "therefore the mean field reduces to @xmath538 we can now use the incompressibility , which when applied to ( 8.1 ) gives @xmath539 this says that @xmath540 where @xmath541 is a divergence free ( rotational ) field .",
    "the field @xmath541 can be determined explicitly by solving the global equation ( 8.2 ) , ( in @xmath542 ) , for the pressure @xmath356 . for this purpose",
    "one needs to impose the appropriate boundary condition on the pressure in order to close the system .",
    "we impose the neumann condition @xmath543 for the pressure .",
    "in fact lions @xcite and sanchez - palencia @xcite impose the condition @xmath544 which when inserted in ( 8.1 ) gives @xmath545    we consider @xmath546 n\\cdot{\\nabla_x}p_0(\\cdot,\\tau)=0,\\;\\;{\\rm on}\\;\\;{\\partial}{\\omega } ,   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] for every @xmath547 , and obtain @xmath548 where @xmath46 denotes projection onto the divergence free part of the conduction term .",
    "collecting the results from the above discussion we can now express the mean field as @xmath549 this gives the contribution of the conduction and the global pressure to the small scale flow .",
    "we have let the local flow settle down and averaged ( in @xmath35 ) , denoted by overbar , over the unit cell @xmath34 , @xmath45 .",
    "if we take boundary layer effects into account , we can , considering the simplest case of a boundary layer , specify the value of the global pressure gradient @xmath361 at the boundary , of the boundary layer .",
    "for instance we can put @xmath550 this will result in the additional term @xmath551 in the mean field , where @xmath552 is the usual neumann kernel for the laplacian . in this case",
    "the mean field becomes @xmath553    the above formulas give the mean field flow with the global convection ( rolls ) taken out .",
    "this was done by imposing the periodic boundary conditions on the local cell , see the introduction .",
    "the two - scale convergence carries over to a larger class of test functions which are non - periodic , see @xcite .",
    "this will not be repeated here , but to be able to compare the true ( collective ) mean field we compute the average over the convection term in the non - periodic case . by the taylor and mean value theorems we get , in the two - dimensional case , @xmath554 @xmath555 @xmath556 @xmath557 @xmath558 where @xmath559 , @xmath560 is the point in @xmath535 where u attains its mean value , and @xmath561 is the location of the box .",
    "the error term @xmath562 is bounded by theorem 4.2 . in global coordinates",
    "we therefore get @xmath563 and similarly @xmath564 if we insert this into the expression for the mean field and differentiate with respect to the fast time variable @xmath37 , we obtain , as @xmath25 , @xmath565 i.e. a forced euler equation , where @xmath42 is a function of the scaled variables @xmath566 .",
    "the computation in the three - dimensional case is similar .",
    "thus the local flow satisfies the navier - stokes equation , whereas the mean flow satisfies the euler equation .",
