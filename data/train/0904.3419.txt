    "ss433 is a massive close binary system at advanced evolutionary stage @xcite .",
    "this unique galactic x - ray binary with precessing relativistic jets ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the speed of light ) exhibits several variabilities , including the precessional one ( with the period @xmath9  d ) , the eclipsing one ( with the binary orbital period @xmath10  d ) , and the nutational one ( with the nutation period @xmath11  d ) ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "ss433 is recognized as a galactic microquasar with precessing supercritical accretion disk around a compact object , and has been extensively investigated in the optical , radio and x - ray ranges ( for a comprehensive review and references see @xcite ) .",
    "recent high - resolution optical spectroscopy of the system @xcite revealed the presence of absorption lines in the spectrum of the optical component identified as a @xmath12  a7i supergiant star .",
    "observed orbital doppler shifts of the absorption lines of the optical component and stationary heii emission allowed hillwig & gies to determine the mass ratio of the compact ( @xmath13 ) and the optical ( @xmath14 ) components in ss433 @xmath15 , implying the binary masses @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "similar values of @xmath18 and @xmath14 were obtained from the analysis of the optical light curves of ss433 @xcite .    the analysis of broad x - ray eclipses in the 1 - 10 kev range observed by _ asca _ and _ ginga _ satellites suggests a smaller mass ratio than that obtained from optical spectroscopy and photometry . for example , using x - ray eclipses observed by _ ginga _ @xcite estimated @xmath19 . in their analysis",
    ", the authors used the simplifying assumption that the x - ray source is compact and the duration of the x - ray eclipse is fully determined by the size of the optical companion .",
    "_ ginga _ light curves at different precessional phases presented in @xcite were analyzed by @xcite using the method of binary light curve synthesis in the model including the precessing accretion disk and jets .",
    "they found the possible range of binary mass ratios @xmath20 . using x - ray emission from ss433 observed by the _",
    "asca _ satellite ( which is mostly produced in precessing thermal jets ) , @xcite and @xcite estimated @xmath21 . their analysis , with account of uncertainties , allowed in fact a fairly broad range of binary mass ratios @xmath22 .",
    "thus the average mass ratio estimate as inferred from the analysis of 1 - 10 kev x - ray data is smaller ( @xmath23 ) than that inferred from optical observations ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath25 the total eclipse of the accretion disk by the optical star must occur , so it is hard to explain a significant optical variability of ss433 in the primary eclipse minimum with precessional phase , as in fact observed @xcite .",
    "the integral satellite detected the hard x - ray emission from ss433 up to 100 kev @xcite .",
    "our studies of ss433 based on the integral observations suggested the presence of a hot rarefied corona above the supercritical accretion disk in this source @xcite . the peculiar variability in the shape and width of the primary eclipse in hard x - rays was discovered .",
    "the spectral analysis of archival rxte observations of ss433 @xcite found evidence for strong variable x - ray absorption which does not support the assumption that the optical star can be considered as an opaque screen with sharp edges at these energies .",
    "this implies that the primary eclipse in ss433 is not purely geometrical and that the binary mass ratio as inferred from the analysis of the _ ginga _ and _ asca _ data may suffer from systematic uncertainties .",
    "the results of our previous analysis of the orbital and precessional variability in ss433 observed by integral @xcite can be summarized as follows .",
    "the hard x - ray flux ( 25 - 50 kev ) from the source clearly exhibits variability with the precessional period @xmath26  d from @xmath27  mcrab at the cross - over phase to @xmath28  mcrab at the maximum disk opening phase ( the @xmath29 moment , where the moving emission lines in the ss433 spectrum are at maximum separation ) .",
    "eclipses are observed with the orbital period @xmath10  d and are very significant .",
    "eclipses observed close to the @xmath29 phase ( at the precessional phase @xmath30 ) are the deepest ones . the hard x - ray flux ( 18 - 60  kev ) at the center of the primary eclipse is still detectable at a level of @xmath27  mcrab , so the ratio of the maximum uneclipsed flux ( @xmath31  mcrab ) to the minimum flux value at the mid - eclipse is about 6 - 7 , which is similar to the amplitude of the precessional off - eclipse hard x - ray variability .",
    "the width of the hard x - ray eclipse is found to be larger than that in soft x - rays .",
    "the egress out of the hard x - ray eclipse is observed to be strongly variable , most probably due to absorption of the x - ray flux by accretion flows and asymmetric structured wind from the supercritical accretion disk and by the wind - wind collision region .",
    "similar distortions of the eclipse egress were first observed by _ ginga _ ( 18.4 - 27.6 kev ) @xcite . the hard x - ray spectrum ( 20 - 200 kev ) does not noticeably change with precessional phase .",
    "all these facts suggest that most of the hard x - ray flux of ss433 is generated in a hot extended corona formed in the central parts of the accretion disk .",
    "the hot corona may be formed as a result of collision of the wind inhomogeneities with relativistic jets @xcite . a more detailed interpretation of the broad - band ( 3 - 90 kev ) x - ray continuum of ss433 in terms of the multicomponent model including the accretion disk , jet and corona has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we analyze integral observations of hard x - ray eclipses of ss433 near the t3 moment and interpret them in terms of our multicomponent geometrical model with account of the peculiar shape and strong variability of the primary eclipse and precessional x - ray variability of the source . in section [ s_observ ]",

    "we discuss the obtained results in section [ s_disc ] and summarize our findings in section [ s_concl ] .",
    "dedicated integral observations of ss433 were carried out in ao-1 for 500 ks , in ao-3 for 500 ks , in ao-4 for 466 ks , in ao-5 for @xmath32  ks and in ao-6 for @xmath33  ks .",
    "the ao-1 observations ( integral orbits 67 - 69 ) were performed at the precessional phase 0 with maximum disk opening . in ao-2 , ss433 fell within the fov of ibis when observing the sagittarius arm tangent region , but no x - ray eclipses occurred during this program . in ao-3 , ss433 was observed around different precessional phases ( integral orbits 366 - 369 ) .",
    "one x - ray eclipse was partially measured again at the precessional phase close to zero , with an indication of a much narrower eclipse or a sudden mid - eclipse ( at the orbital phase @xmath34 ) flux increase .",
    "based on these data , the model for the source eclipse has been constructed in @xcite ; however , these data were not strongly constrained by precessional variability and allowed a broad range of the binary mass ratio @xmath35 . in ao-4 , the source was observed in may 2007 ; unfortunately , due to high variability , the source flux was very low , so we exclude these data from the analysis of x - ray eclipses ( set ii in fig .",

    "note the strong increase in the apparent eclipse width . in ao-5 , two consecutive",
    "eclipses of the source near the zero precessional phase @xmath36 were observed in october 2007 . adding all of these observations allowed us to construct hard x - ray spectra of the source at different precessional phases ( fig .",

    "the egress out of the primary eclipse of ss433 was observed in september 2008 ( set v in fig .",

    "the integral data were processed with both publically available isdc software ( osa-7 version ) and the original software package written by the iki integral team ( for the ibis / isgri telescope , see @xcite for more detail ) . for the analysis of precessional variability of ss433 we have used both data from our integral observing program of ss433 and publically available data of all observations where the source was in the fov of the ibis / isgri telescope ( @xmath37 degrees ) .",
    "the total exposure of the selected data is approximately @xmath38 ms . to perform precessional phase - resolved analysis we ascribed to each scw ( science window or scw , the natural piece of integral data  pointing observation with an exposure of @xmath39  ks ) the appropriate orbital and precessional phases .",

    "we have used only observations at orbital phases from the range @xmath44 . after this filtering",
    "we still have @xmath45  ms of data distributed across all precessional phases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ distr_tot_exp ] ( the right panel ) .    the combined ao1  ao5 data ( including those publically available ) enabled us to measure , for the first time , the precessional hard x - ray variability ( fig . [ f0],[f1 ] ) , which turned out to be quite significant and stable over several precessional periods .",
    "the maximum to minimum flux ratio of the average precessional variability is around 5 - 7 , which is higher than in softer x - ray bands , and suggests the hard x - ray emission originating closer to the base of the visible part of the jets .",
    "the eclipsing and precessional variabilities , combined with spectroscopic data simultaneously taken with integral observations by the 6-m telescope sao ras , were taken into account when attempting to model the light curve of the source by @xcite .",
    "however , the results proved to be inconclusive .",
    "first of all , the spectral resolution of the optical observations ( around 3000 ) was insufficient to definitely measure the radial velocity curve of the optical companion .",
    "the modeling of x - ray eclipse and precessional variability allowed fairly broad range of parameters , including the mass ratios @xmath35 ( primarily due to the lack of reliable observations at the middle of the hard x - ray eclipse ) . an independent spectral analysis of archival rxte observations of ss433 @xcite also suggested that it is hard to derive the binary mass ratio based on x - ray eclipse observations only .",
    "our previous studies @xcite suggested that ss433 is a superaccreting galactic microquasar with hot corona above the accretion disk which scatters hard x - ray radiation from the central parts of the disk .",
    "out of the eclipse , the source has been reliably detected by ibis / isgri telescope up to 100 kev , with the x - ray continuum fitted by a featureless power - law @xmath46  ph / s/@xmath47/kev @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ xspectra ] .",
    "integral observations ( 2003 - 2007 ) were separated into three segments in the precessional phase ( fig .",

    "[ xspectra ] , with no clear difference in the power - law fit in the 20 - 100 kev energy band .",
    "it is recognized from rxte observations that at softer x - ray band the spectrum is very variable @xcite , but errors in the first point 18 - 22 kev of our fit which can be due to this variability have no effect on the value of the power - law fit .",
    "one hard x - ray spectral fit at different precessional phases of the accretion disk suggests the presence of a fairly broad hard x - ray emission region . to be independent of the disk opening angle varying with the precessional phase",

    "the model gives the best spectral fits for @xmath50  kev with thomson optical depth @xmath51 , the mass outflow rate in the jet @xmath52  g / s corresponding to a jet kinetic power of @xmath53  erg / s .",
    "these parameters suggest an electron density of @xmath54  @xmath55 at distances @xmath56  cm . such a density is typical in the wind outflowing with velocity @xmath57  km / s from a supercritical accretion disk with @xmath58  m@xmath59/yr at distances @xmath60  cm from the center , where the compton - thick photosphere is formed @xcite .",
    "note that despite several primary eclipses have already been observed by integral , the measured hard x - ray flux @xmath61  mcrab from the source is still insufficient for phase - resolved spectral analysis of an individual eclipse .",
    "to this aim , additional observations of ss433 by integral are planned .",
    "the dedicated integral observations of the primary eclipses of ss433 in 2003 , 2007 and 2008 were obtained near the @xmath43 precessional phase when the accretion disk is maximally open .",

    "we have used only sets i , iii , iv , v and excluded set ii ( the one showing the most suppressed egress out of the primary eclipse ) .",
    "ss433 is known to be a highly variable object at all wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising for a supercritically accreting massive binary , considering various instabilities that should be immanently present in the mass outflow from the optical star and in the accretion disk .",
    "it might appear that the primary eclipse of the hard x - ray emission coming from the regions close to the central black hole by the optical star should be stable .",
    "however , it is not the case for hard x - ray eclipse in ss433 ( fig . [ f_alleclipses ] ) . as seen in this figure ,",
    "the second eclipse observed in may 2007 ( integral orbits 555 - 556 ) has an unusually broad form : a shallow ingress to and broad egress from the eclipse , which may be due to the low level of uneclipsed x - ray flux from the source @xmath67  mcrab .",
    "note that this particular eclipse is very similar to the one observed by _",
    "ginga _ @xcite . however , already at the next t3 moment in october 2007 ( sets iii and iv in fig .",
    "[ f_alleclipses ] ) the uneclipsed x - ray flux was at a level of 20 mcrab and the egress from eclipse restored its more familiar form ( like in set i ) .",
    "this effect is particularly clearly visible on the combined x - ray eclipse light curve shown in fig .",
    "[ eclipse ] .",
    "the reason for such a strong variability of the hard x - ray egress may be related to powerful inhomogeneous gaseous streams feeding the disk and the wind from the supercritical accretion disk .",
    "additional x - ray absorption can be produced in the collision region of the winds from the optical star and the supercritical accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the slow dense wind from the accretion disk in ss433 should form a compton - thick photosphere and funnels around relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "the height of the funnel @xmath68  cm , comparable to the accretion disk size , can be inferred from the observed @xmath69-s lag of the optical emission with respect to the x - rays from the jet base found in the simultaneous optical / x - ray observations of the source @xcite .",
    "thus it appears quite possible that the variable wind from the precessing supercritical accretion disk causes changes of the funnel structure , so even at the maximum opening disk phase ( t3 ) the shape of hard x - ray eclipse may appreciably vary depending on the accretion rate through the disk . in this connection",
    "it is worth noticing the variable broad absorption - like feature that appears immediately after the egress from the eclipse ( at orbital phases @xmath70 , see fig . [ f_alleclipses ] ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to know whether this feature is due to the true absorption of x - ray emission or just reflects the strong variability of the proper x - ray flux .",
    "we conclude that the hard x - ray eclipse in ss433 is likely to be formed by both geometrical screening of the broad x - ray emitting region by the opaque star and complex gaseous stream and/or inhomogeneous wind from the optical star and the supercritical accretion disk , as well as by the wind - wind collision region .",
    "this implies that when fitting the hard x - ray primary eclipse in ss433 by geometrical model , we should use the most stable part of the observed eclipses , i.e. the ingress to the eclipse and the _ upper envelope _ of the observed egress out of eclipse . in view of high variability ,",
    "the analysis of one individual x - ray eclipse only can lead to erroneous determination of the binary system parameters .",
    "moreover , for their reliable determination a joint modeling of both orbital and precessional variability of hard x - ray flux is needed .",
    "to analyze hard x - ray eclipses of ss433 we used a geometrical model developed earlier for the interpretation of the _ ginga _ data @xcite and the _ integral _ light curve @xcite .",
    "we consider a close binary system consisting of an ( opaque ) `` normal '' star limited by the roche equipotential surface and a compact object surrounded by an optically and geometrically thick `` accretion disk '' .",
    "relativistic jets are directed perpendicularly to the disk plane .",
    "the `` accretion disk '' includes the disk itself and an extended photosphere formed by the outflowing wind .",
    "the orbit is circular , the axial rotation of the normal star is assumed to be synchronized with the orbital revolution .",
    "the disk and `` jets '' are precessing in space and change the orientation relative to the normal ( donor ) star .",
    "the disk is inclined with respect to the orbital plane by the angle @xmath71 .",
    "a cone - like funnel is located inside the disk and is characterized by the half - opening angle @xmath72 , thus the opaque disk body ( see fig .",
    "[ f_geommodel ] ) is described by the radius @xmath73 and the angle @xmath72 .",
    "the central object is surrounded by a transparent quasi - isothermal homogeneously emitting spheroid with a visible radius @xmath74 and height @xmath75 which could be interpreted as a `` corona '' or a `` thick jet '' ( without any relativistic bulk motion ) .",
    "here @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath73 are dimensionless values expressed in units of the binary separation @xmath76 . the radius of the normal star is determined by the relative roche lobe size , i.e. by the mass ratio @xmath77 ( @xmath13 is the mass of the compact object ) .",
    "only the `` corona '' is assumed to emit in the hard x - ray band , while the star and disk eclipse it in the course of the orbital and precessional motion . during precession",
    "the inclination of the disk with respect to the observer changes , causing different visibility conditions for the `` corona '' .",
    "the `` corona '' is partially screened by the cone disk edge , which can explain qualitatively the change of the uneclipsed x - ray flux with precession phase .",
    "observations of the precessional variability can thus be used to obtain a `` vertical '' scan of the emitting structure , restricting the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath72 .",
    "the orbital ( eclipse ) variability observations scan the emitting structure `` horizontally '' , restricting possible values of @xmath73 , @xmath72 , @xmath78 and @xmath74 .",
    "the joint analysis of the precessional and eclipse variability thus enables us to reconstruct the spatial structure of the accretion disk central region , where the hard x - rays are produced , and to estimate the binary mass ratio @xmath78 .",
    "the position of the components of the system relative to the observer is determined by the binary orbit inclination angle @xmath79 , the disk inclination angle to the orbital plane @xmath80 @xcite , and the precessional phase @xmath81 .      our model for the orbital and precessional variability of ss433 has the following free parameters : the binary mass ratio @xmath77 determining the relative size of the normal star , the disk parameters @xmath82 determining the form of the disk , the thick `` jet '' or `` corona '' parameters @xmath83 determining the form of the hot corona . note that the x - ray emitting region is qualitatively different for a thin narrow `` jet '' with @xmath84 and a thin short `` jet '' with @xmath85 .",

    "we remind that the precessional light curve was constructed using maximum off - eclipse x - ray flux from the system .",
    "the precessional variability amplitude was assumed to be @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath2 criterion was used to evaluate the goodness of fits .    to examine as fully as possible the binary system parameters , we have used different variants of modeling of the observed orbital hard x - ray variability .",

    "all methods give similar results .",
    "the inferred binary system parameters are found to be sensitive mostly to the form of ingress and the duration of the primary eclipse .",
    "the results of the analysis can be summarized as follows .",

    "taking into account highly variable character of the eclipse egress noted above , below we shall discuss solutions and model parameters obtained from the analysis of the _ eclipse ingress part only_. in the combined primary eclipse ( fig .",
    "[ eclipse ] ) the ingress part is mostly determined by sets i and iv .",
    "\\4 ) in our previous analysis of the primary orbital eclipse observed by integral @xcite we found that for all models the best - fit values ( corresponding to the minimum @xmath2 ) are obtained for the maximum possible radius of the disk @xmath73 and the maximum possible value of the angle @xmath72 .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed here using new data .",
    "we also confirm that parameters @xmath75 and @xmath72 are correlated .",
    "\\5 ) the minimum deviation of the best - fit model eclipsing light curve from observed points is reached for the small mass ratio @xmath90 and a long x - ray emitting `` jet '' ( @xmath91 ) with the base radius varying in the wide range ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "this means that the `` jet '' can be long but either thin or thick .",
    "however , the main objection to model of the long `` jet '' comes from its inability to describe the observed precessional variability as shown in fig .",
    "[ f_longjet ] .",
    "we conclude that at small mass ratio @xmath93 our model does not simultaneously fit both orbital and precessional variability of ss433 observed by integral .",

    "\\6 ) for @xmath95 our model provides almost similarly good fits to the orbital and precessional variability of ss433 . to find the best - fit value of @xmath78 we calculate the sum of the reduced @xmath2 for the orbital and precessional light curves obtained for the same model parameters : @xmath96 ( fig .",

    "[ chi2 ] , panel ( b ) , shows that @xmath98 deviations for the orbital eclipse increase with @xmath78 ; there is a quasi - plateau at @xmath100 , then the deviations rapidly increase due to a poor fit to the orbital eclipse ( especially the eclipse width , see fig .",
    "[ q06 ] ) .",
    "[ chi2 ] , panel ( c ) , demonstrates that for @xmath25 fits to the precessional light curve sharply worsen .    as follows from fig .",
    "[ chi2 ] , the values of the reduced @xmath101 and @xmath98 ( minimized relative to four model parameters @xmath97 ) are much higher than unity .",
    "this means that our model is oversimplified and is not fully adequate to the observational data .",
    "the data demonstrate a significant dispersion due to both physical variability of hard x - ray flux and systematic effects of absorption by gaseous streams and in the wind - wind collision region , which we do not take into account in our model .",
    "so we can not rigorously estimate the confidence region of the sought parameter @xmath78 .",
    "when the reduced @xmath102 , it is generally accepted to give only the optimal value of the sought parameter , without quoting the confidence range since the latter can not be statistically justified .",

    "such a good convergence of the mass ratio estimates found from different and independent observational data strengthens the reliability of the found binary mass ratio value @xmath3 .    the best - fit model parameters for @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ q03 ] ) correspond to an extended oblate corona with width comparable to the size of the accretion disk ( @xmath110 ) and small vertical height ( @xmath111 ) . in the framework of our model ,",
    "such a geometry of the hard x - ray emitting region is caused by the wide primary eclipse minimum and large amplitude of the precessional variability .",
    "the precessional light curve in hard x - rays is shaped by the outer parts of the disk eclipsing the high - temperature corona that scatters thermal x - rays from jets and possibly the innermost accretion disk @xcite .",
    "[ q03 ] shows the orbital and precessional light curves for the optimal binary mass ratio @xmath112 . for comparison ,",

    "[ chi2 ] ( the middle panel ) formally shows . in fig .",
    "[ f_q03_model ] we illustrate the view of our optimal geometrical model of ss433 with @xmath112 as seen at different precession angles . in this figure",
    "thin relativistic jets ( emitting mostly in soft x - rays ) are not shown .     at different disk precession angles ( 15 , 118 , 180 degrees from top to bottom , respectively).,scaledwidth=47.0% ]",
    "our analysis confirms that ss433 is a superaccreting microquasar with black hole .",
    "the obtained high value of the best - fit binary mass ratio in ss433 @xmath3 allows us to explain a substantial amplitude ( @xmath115 ) of the optical variability at the minimum of the primary eclipse with precessional phase .",
    "the orbital inclination of ss433 is known from independent analysis of moving emission lines ( @xmath116 , @xcite ) , so at low mass ratios @xmath117 the small relative radius of the roche lobe of the compact object should have caused the total eclipse of the bright precessing accretion disc around the compact object by the optical a7i - star , implying a constant optical flux at the center of the eclipse at different precessional phases .",
    "this contradicts observations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . at @xmath118",
    "the size of the roche lobe of the compact object is relatively large to cause only partial primary optical eclipse of the accretion disc by the a7i - star at all precessional phases , which leads to a noticeable precessional variability of the minimum brightness at the middle of the primary eclipse .",
    "a small value of the binary mass ratio was found by @xcite from the analysis of soft ( @xmath119  kev ) x - ray eclipses of ss433 .",
    "the modeling of broad - band x - ray spectrum of ss433 shows that in this energy range thermal emission of relativistic jets with temperature decreasing along the jet dominates @xcite .",
    "the observed broad width of the soft x - ray eclipse was interpreted by @xcite in terms of purely geometrical model of the eclipse of jets by the optical star with sharp limb , yielding a small value of the binary mass ratio @xmath120 .",
    "the observed independence of the soft x - ray eclipse width on energy has been the main argument justifying this model and hence the inferred low value of the mass ratio .",
    "however , this argument holds only if the temperature along jets does not change with distance from the compact object .",
    "in fact it decreases along jets ( unless some additional heating mechanism is assumed ) , so at energies @xmath67  kev central parts of the jets are eclipsed .",
    "consequently , the duration of purely geometrical eclipses must be longer at 10 kev than at @xmath121  kev where cooler periphery of the jets is eclipsed @xcite .",
    "the independence of the x - ray eclipse duration on energy in the 1 - 10  kev range can be due to the compensation of the effect of decreasing temperature along jets and the increase of soft x - ray absorption in the extended atmosphere of the optical star , which is clearly seen in the rxte observations @xcite .",
    "so the effective radius of the eclipsing star increases at lower energies .",
    "this explains the constant width of x - ray eclipse in the 1 - 10 kev energy range . turning this argument around , from the independent width of the x - ray eclipse in this energy range",
    "we can conclude that the eclipsing a7i - star in ss433 has not a sharp limb , so that x - ray eclipses in ss433 are not purely geometrical and are suffered from extinction in the heavy stellar wind from the optical star .",
    "this lends additional support to our interpretation of x - ray eclipses in ss433 making use of only the upper envelope of variable eclipsing hard x - ray light curve .",
    "our analysis of the primary hard x - ray eclipse of ss433 at the precessional phase @xmath122 with account for precessional variability of the off - eclipse flux suggests the optimal binary mass ratio @xmath123 . from spectroscopic observations of ss433 carried out by @xcite a semi - amplitude of the radial velocity curve of the optical a7i - component was determined : @xmath124  km / s . combining it with semi - amplitude of the radial velocity curve of the compact component @xmath125  km / s @xcite and the binary inclination angle @xmath126 @xcite",
    ", we obtain for the mass function of the optical component of ss433 @xmath127 and the spectroscopic mass ratio @xmath108 .",
    "this allows us to estimate masses of the compact object and the optical star for @xmath3 : @xmath128    with the derived mass function of the compact star @xmath129 , the binary mass ratio range @xmath130 obtained from our analysis allows the mass range of the compact star @xmath131 .",
    "the lower mass limit for @xmath132 formally admits a neutron star as the compact object in ss433 .",
    "however , the optimal value @xmath3 independently obtained from the analysis of hard x - ray eclipses and precessional variability fully agrees with the mass ratio value @xmath133 found by @xcite from optical spectroscopy .",
    "so we conclude that the compact object in ss433 is highly unlikely to be a neutron star and is indeed a black hole .    the mass of the black hole in ss433 @xmath134 is strongly based on its mass function derived from the optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the value of the mass function is very sensitive to the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the optical star @xmath135 .",
    "as we emphasized earlier @xcite , the measured semi - amplitude can be affected by the x - ray heating effect of the optical star , since we ascribe the observed radial velocity amplitude to the center of mass of the optical star filling its roche lobe .",
    "the effect decreases with the binary mass ratio @xmath78 .",
    "although no signatures of the x - ray illumination effect on the radial velocity amplitude was found by @xcite , the obtained semi - amplitude @xmath136 and hence the derived mass function of the compact star in ss433 should be treated with some reservation .",
    "clearly , new high - resolution optical spectroscopy of ss433 is in order to accurately measure the radial velocity curve of the optical star .",
    "the discovery of strong variability of the hard x - ray eclipse at precessional phases corresponding to the maximum disk opening angle for the observer and regular significant precessional variability are the main findings of our integral observations of ss433 . it is shown that the duration of the primary x - ray eclipse at different epochs changes by @xmath137 times , the amplitude of the precessional variability is 5 - 7 times .",
    "this implies that x - ray eclipses in ss433 are not purely geometrical , they are shaped by absorption in a powerful stellar wind and gas streams from the optical star , as well as in the wind - wind collision region .",
    "so to infer the binary mass ratio @xmath78 from the analysis of x - ray eclipses , we have used only the ingress to and upper envelope of egress out of the primary eclipse . the joint analysis of eclipsing light curve and the regular precessional light curve for off - eclipse flux from the system yielded the mass ratio estimate @xmath138 .",
    "the relatively high value of the binary mass ratio @xmath139 ( and hence the relatively large size of the roche lobe of the compact star ) suggests an explanation to peculiarities of the optical variability of ss433 , in particular , to the observed substantial precessional variability of the minimum brightness at the middle of the primary optical eclipse .",
    "using the mass function of the optical star found by @xcite @xmath140 and the value of @xmath123 corresponding to the absolute minimum of @xmath101 residuals , we concluded that the masses of binary components of ss433 are @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the high mass of the compact object leaves no doubts that it is a black hole .",
    "the independence of the hard x - ray spectrum on the accretion disk precessional phase suggests that the hard x - ray emission ( @xmath141  kev ) is formed in an extended , hot , quasi - isothermal corona .",
    "the heating of the corona can be related to transformation of the kinetic energy of relativistic jets to an inhomogeneous wind outflow from the precessing supercritical accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations of broadband x - ray spectrum of ss433 at the maximum disk opening precessional phases @xcite allowed us to determine the main physical characteristics of the hot corona ( temperature @xmath50  kev , thomson optical depth @xmath142 ) , as well as to estimate the mass outflow rate in jets @xmath143  g  s@xmath144 yielding the kinetic power of the jets @xmath53  erg  s@xmath144 .",
