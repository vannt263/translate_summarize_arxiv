    "<S> , as that which we aim to discuss here , the electroweak precision tests represent the only indirect way to search for these new particles .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss electroweak radiative effects from extensions of the ordinary fermionic spectrum of the sm . </S>",
    "<S> the new fermions are supposed to possess the same colour and electroweak quantum numbers as the ordinary ones and to mix very tinily with the ordinary three generations .    </S>",
    "<S> the most straightforward realization of such a fermionic extension of the sm is the introduction of a fourth generation of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility has been almost entirely jeopardized by the lep bound on the numbers of neutrinos species . </S>",
    "<S> although there still exists the obvious way out of having new fermion generations with neutrinos of mass @xmath2 , we think that these options are awkward enough not to deserve further studies . </S>",
    "<S> rather , what we have in mind in tackling this problem are general frames discussing new physics beyond the sm which lead to new quarks and/or leptons classified in the usual chiral way with iso - doublets and iso - singolets for different chiralities .    </S>",
    "<S> situations of this kind may be encountered in grand unified schemes where the ordinary fifteen weyl spinors of each fermionic generation are only part of larger representations or where new fermions ( possibly also mirror fermions ) are requested by the group or manifold structure of the schemes . </S>",
    "<S> chiral fermions with heavy static masses may also provide a first approximation of virtual effects in techicolor - like schemes when the dynamical behaviour of technifermion self - energies are neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> although such effects have been extensively investigated in the literature @xcite , our presentation focuses mainly on two aspects , which have been only partially touched in the previous analyses : the use of effective lagrangians for a model - independent treatment of the problem and a discussion of the validity of this approach in comparison with the computation in the full - fledged theory .    </S>",
    "<S> while separate tests can be set up for each different extension of the sm , there may be some advantage in realizing this analysis in a model independent framework . </S>",
    "<S> the natural theoretical tool to this purpose is represented by an effective electroweak lagrangian where , giving up the renormalizability requirement , all @xmath3 invariant operators up to a given dimension are present with unknown coefficients , to be eventually determined from the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> each different model fixes uniquely this set of coefficients and the effective lagrangian becomes in this way a common ground to discuss and compare several sm extensions . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of the well known @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite or @xmath7 s @xcite variables was much in the same spirit and the use of an effective lagrangian represents in a sense the natural extension of these approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of an effective lagrangian for the electroweak physics has been originally advocated for the study of the large higgs mass limit in the sm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , contributions from chiral @xmath8 doublets have been considered in the degenerate case @xcite , for small splitting @xcite and in the case of infinite splitting @xcite . in the present note </S>",
    "<S> we will deal with the general case of arbitrary splitting among the fermions in the doublet . </S>",
    "<S> our results will be used to test the model with the latest available data .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of an effective lagrangian in precision tests has its own limitations , which are also discussed in the present note . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we are going to use an effective electroweak lagrangian organized in a derivative expansion which we truncate at the fourth order . </S>",
    "<S> when discussing two - point vector boson functions @xmath9 , this amounts to keep only the constant and linear terms in @xmath10 : ^_ij ( q ) = _ ij(q^2 ) g^ + ( q^q^  terms ) [ a0 ] _ </S>",
    "<S> ij(q^2)a_ij + q^2 f_ij(q^2 ) = a_ij + q^2 f_ij(0 ) + ... [ a1 ]    the next terms in the @xmath10 expansion are suppressed by increasing powers of @xmath11 , @xmath12 generically representing the mass of the particles running in the loop . </S>",
    "<S> one can ask how large has to be @xmath12 to obtain a sensible approximation from the truncation of the full one - loop result . as we will see , for lep i observables , </S>",
    "<S> the truncation is a very good approximation already for relatively light fermions , with masses around @xmath13 .    </S>",

    "<S> one of the two masses is kept fixed at @xmath53 , and the other one runs from @xmath53 to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the small masses cause a substantial deviation from the asymptotic , effective lagrangian prediction . nevertheless , as illustrated in fig . 1 , </S>",
    "<S> such a large effect is still compatible with the present data . </S>",
    "<S> the case of a full new generation is shown in the solid line of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .    in particular , as it was observed in @xcite , a large negative contribution to both @xmath39 and @xmath40 is now possible , due to a formal divergence of @xmath55 at the threshold which produces a large and positive @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , this behaviour can not be reproduced by @xmath26 , which , at the fourth order in derivatives , automatically sets @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> a relevant question is , then , when the asymptotical regime starts , i.e. how close to @xmath58 should be the masses of the new quarks or leptons for observing deviations due to the full expression of @xmath59 instead of the truncated expression given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis shows that already for masses of the new fermions above @xmath60 the difference between the values of the @xmath61 obtained with the truncated and full expression of @xmath59 are as small as @xmath62 , i.e. below the present experimental level of accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 where the asymptotical and full expression of @xmath40 are compared as a function of @xmath41 .    beyond the indirect precision tests , the possibility of having new fermions carrying the usual @xmath63 quantum numbers </S>",
    "<S> can clearly also be bounded by the direct searches .    concerning the present searches , from lep we have the lower bound of @xmath0 which applies independently from any assumption on the decay modes of the new fermions which couple to the @xmath64 boson . </S>",
    "<S> much stronger limits on the new quarks masses can be inferred from the tevatron results . however , as we know from the search for the top quark , these latter bounds rely on assumptions concerning the decay modes of the heavy quark . for instance , in the case of the top search it was stressed that if a new decay channel into the @xmath65 quark and a charged higgs were avaible to the top , then one could not use the cdf bounds on @xmath66 @xcite which came along these last years , before the final discovery of the top quark .    </S>",
    "<S> now , it may be conceivable that the new physics related to the presence of extra - fermions can also affect their possible decay channels making the lightest of the new fermions unstable . indeed , we stated in our assumption that the new fermions do not essentially mix with the ordinary ones , hence one has to invoke new physics if one wants to avoid the formation of stable heavy mesons made out of the lightest stable new fermion and of the ordinary fermions of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> if the new fermions can decay within the detector , then the bounds on their masses , coming from tevatron data , must be discussed in a model - dependent way and even the case of new quarks with masses close to @xmath0 is not fully ruled out .    </S>",
    "<S> if on the contrary the lightest new quark is stable , then searches for exotic heavy meson at cdf already ruled out the possibility of being near the threshold @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of coloured particle with charge @xmath67 is strictly bounded over @xmath68 from cdf experiment @xcite . finally , note that for charged leptons the bound coming from cdf are much less stringent . </S>",
    "<S> a new stable charged lepton of mass of @xmath69 can not be ruled out .    </S>",
    "<S> we are aware of the fact that apart from bounds coming from the direct production of the new fermions , there exist also cosmological limits which apply to the case of stable electrically charged and ( or ) coloured fermions . </S>",
    "<S> cosmologically stable quarks of masses up to @xmath70 can be ruled out on the basis of the results concerning superheavy element searches @xcite . as for </S>",
    "<S> stable charged hadronic superheavies in the @xmath71 range they seem to be in contrast with the bounds which are obtained requiring that heavy particles captured by neutrons star do not induce their collapse to a black hole . clearly all these severe bounds apply only to the case of cosmologically stable new fermions , so that one can easily avoid them for fermions which have some ( even very small ) mixing with the ordinary fermions and ( or ) decay through particles which are related to the new physics beyond the sm .    finally , concerning future searches , we comment on an effect due to the presence of new heavy quarks which may be potentially relevant for the lhc physics . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the production and decay into a photon pair of a higgs of intermediate mass , i.e. @xmath72 . the presence of new quarks give rise to competing effects of opposite sign at the level of production and @xmath1 decay of this intermediate higgs .    indeed , </S>",
    "<S> as for production , the gluon - fusion amplitude increases due to the effect of the new quarks which adds up to that of the top @xcite . for a new doublet of quarks heavier than the higgs , </S>",
    "<S> the sm gluon - fusion amplitude gets approximately multiplied by a factor 3 , the total number of heavy quarks in the loop . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an enhancement of a factor nine , roughly , for the cross section production .    </S>",
    "<S> however , in the decay into two photons the new quarks tend to decrease the rate . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contribution to @xmath73 comes from the loop where the @xmath30 boson run , while the top exchange contribution yields an opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> again the new heavy fermions produce contribution which are analogous to those due to the top exchange and , hence , tend to reduce the decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , when additional fermions are present , the partial width of the higgs into a photon pair is given by @xcite : ( h)= g_f m_h^3 | f_1 ( ) + _ i n_i q_i^2 f_1/2 ( _ i)|^2 [ wid ] where the sum extends over all fermions of masses @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 for quarks and @xmath78 for leptons . in the asymptotic regime , for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , one has : f_1()= 7 ,  f_1/2(_i)=-  , [ tau ] when @xmath81 , from eqs . </S>",
