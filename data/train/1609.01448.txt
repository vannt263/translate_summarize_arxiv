    "<S> several remarks are in order here . </S>",
    "<S> first , @xmath76 relates to the photon s mass . </S>",
    "<S> second , in this paper , we shall focus on the case with the positive photon s mass ( @xmath77 ) that corresponds to the screening effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is instructive to separate @xmath76 into two parts as : @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term with @xmath71 has a topological origin and is effectively induced by ( 1 + 1)d chiral anomaly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second term @xmath79 stems from the essential 2d nature of type - ii weyl fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> following the standard procedure , one finds the effective potential within the random phase approximation @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the dielectric function . according to @xmath82 , for the long - range interaction with small momentum @xmath83 , the magnitude of dielectric function is much larger than 1 , which reduces the strength of the coulomb interaction . on the other hand , for the short - range interaction with large momentum , the magnitude of the dielectric function is almost 1 , so the coulomb interaction is not influenced . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the long - range interaction is screened due to the extended fermi surface , but the short - range one is not .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the aforementioned @xmath41 scheme is a mass - independent one and does not see the mass thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> it is the mass of photon in this case @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> this decoupling effect is implemented by hand @xcite : the heavy field ( photon ) is present at the energy scale higher than the mass of photon , but it is integrated out at the low energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the full theory in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqfeynmanrule ] ) is valid for whole energy scale , and the effective field theory @xmath85 for low - energy region , i.e. @xmath86\\psi+\\frac{e^{2}b}{m}\\left(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\right)^{2}+\\mathcal{o}\\left(\\frac{1}{m^{2}}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 are determined by matching conditions @xcite : at energy scale @xmath89 , these two theories in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqfeynmanrule ] ) with photon field and @xmath90 without the photon field should give rise to the same s - matrix elements for light - particle scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> at tree level , we have @xmath91 , @xmath92 . since the operators @xmath93 are irrelevant , the corresponding rg equations for @xmath94 equal to zero in the low - energy region . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , one - loop corrections do not change the dimension of operator @xmath95 , so this operator remains irrelevant and the argument above is still valid . </S>",
    "<S> as we have shown , the 2d type - ii weyl fermions with @xmath96 are stable in the high - energy region without the decoupling effect . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the above analysis suggests that they still remain stable even with the decoupling effect .    in summary , the infrared stable fixed points for 2d weyl fermions do exist because of the interplay between the nontrivial fermi surface and the coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the logarithmic divergence of fermi velocity is suppressed in this case . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the magnitude of the renormalized tilting parameter @xmath2 remains larger than 1 , indicating that the fermi surface of 2d type - ii anisotropic weyl fermions is stable against the coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the rg analysis here can be directly transplanted to the 3d type - ii weyl semimetals .    </S>",
