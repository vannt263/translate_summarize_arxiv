    "the graph - coloring problem ( gcp ) is a well - known combinatorial optimization problem that has many practical applications .",
    "for example , it can be applied in register allocation in compilers  @xcite , timetabling  @xcite , frequency assignment in cellular networks  @xcite , scheduling  @xcite , printed circuit board testing  @xcite , and manufacturing  @xcite .",
    "in addition to its practical relevance , the problem represents a test bed for new algorithms primarily because of its simple definition .",
    "the problem can be defined informally as follows : in a given undirected graph @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes a finite set of vertices and @xmath2 a finite set of unordered pairs of vertices called edges , the vertices have to be colored using @xmath3 colors such that no two vertices connected with an edge are of the same color .",
    "such a coloring , if it exists , is named the _ proper _ @xmath3-coloring .",
    "the minimum number of colors @xmath3 necessary to color the graph @xmath4 is called the _ chromatic number _",
    "@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the graph is @xmath3-colorable if it has a @xmath3-coloring .",
    "searching for a proper graph @xmath3-coloring is denoted as @xmath3-gcp .",
    "the decision form of this problem , where the question is whether a particular graph is @xmath3-colorable , is @xmath6-complete  @xcite , while the problem of finding the chromatic number of graph @xmath4 is @xmath6-hard @xcite .    the first algorithms for graph coloring tried to solve this problem exactly  @xcite , i.e. , by enumerating all possible orderings of the vertices .",
    "however , these algorithms were too time consuming and infeasible for large graphs , therefore , many approaches that tackled the problem heuristically were proposed .",
    "they tried to find an approximate solution in reasonable time .",
    "the most natural approach to coloring graph vertices heuristically was the greedy approach  @xcite .",
    "the best known heuristics of this type are the _",
    "largest saturation degree _",
    "heuristic dsatur  @xcite , and the _ recursive largest first _",
    "heuristic rlf  @xcite . before coloring ,",
    "dsatur orders graph vertices according to the _ saturation degree _",
    "@xmath7 that is defined as the number of distinctly colored vertices adjacent to vertex @xmath8  @xcite . on the other hand , rlf divides the uncolored graph into color classes that contain vertices colored with the same color .",
    "the algorithm colors the vertices one color class at a time .",
    "the vertices from the uncolored subgraph are added to the current color class in turn so that the number of edges left in the uncolored subgraph remains as few as possible .",
    "some of the most popular algorithms for solving @xmath3-gcp today are metaheuristics based on local search  @xcite .",
    "one of the first metaheuristics was developed by hertz and de werra  @xcite under the name tabucol .",
    "this was the first application of the tabu search  @xcite to graph coloring .",
    "tabucol first generates an initial random @xmath3-coloring , which typically contains a large number of conflicting edges .",
    "then , the heuristic iteratively looks for a single vertex that most decreases the number of conflicting edges when it is recolored with another color , i.e. , moved to another color class .",
    "a tabu list prevents the moves from cycling .",
    "proper @xmath3-coloring may be obtained after a finite number of iterations .",
    "later , tabucol was improved to more sophisticated graph - coloring algorithms  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , other local search heuristics include simulated annealing  @xcite , iterative local search  @xcite , reactive partial tabu search  @xcite , variable neighborhood search  @xcite , adaptive memory  @xcite , variable search space  @xcite , and population - based methods  @xcite .",
    "one of the best population - based algorithms for @xmath3-gcp , the hybrid evolutionary algorithm ( hea ) developed by galiner and hao  @xcite combines local search with the partition - based crossover operator .",
    "the tabucol metaheuristic is used as a local search operator . for a comprehensive survey of the main methods ,",
    "see , e.g. ,  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "evolutionary algorithms  @xcite that operate on a population of solutions are good optimizers , but suffer from a lack of constraint handling abilities .",
    "this lack arises from the fact that the variation operators , i.e. , crossover and mutation , tend to violate the constraints  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "offspring generated from parents by these operators can be infeasible .",
    "indirect constraint handling can be used to overcome this problem . in this case , constraints are transformed into optimization objectives that can be expressed by an objective function .",
    "this function penalizes the candidate solutions violating the constraints .",
    "a solution to the problem is found when all constraints are satisfied .",
    "the value of the objective function in this case decreases to zero .",
    "gcp is a constraint optimization problem where two vertices connected with an edge can not be colored with the same color .",
    "however , the graph vertices have different numbers of edges .",
    "the number of edges incident to vertex @xmath8 is called the _ vertex degree _",
    "@xmath9  @xcite . regarding the vertex degrees",
    ", it may be harder to color vertices with higher rather than lower degree .",
    "this dependence can be expressed by an objective function defined as the sum of the weights assigned to the vertices violating the constraints .",
    "the higher the weight of a vertex , the more difficult the vertex is to color .",
    "the manner in which the weights are changed has a great influence on the performance of a graph - coloring algorithm .",
    "weights can be changed deterministically , adaptively or self - adaptively  @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on graph 3-coloring ( 3-gcp ) that is a special case of @xmath3-gcp , where @xmath10 .",
    "it proposes a self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm for 3-gcp hybridized with :    * heuristic genotype - phenotype mapping ( construction of solutions ) , * a local search heuristic , * a neutral survivor selection operator .",
    "3-gcp is often the subject of research because of the lowest @xmath3 where @xmath3-gcp makes any sense .",
    "this work was motivated by the paper of eiben et al .",
    "@xcite , which was our starting point for 3-gcp .",
    "eiben et al .",
    "describe an evolutionary algorithm with stepwise adaptation of weights ( saw ) , denoted as saw - ea .",
    "solutions in this evolutionary algorithm are represented as permutations of vertices and corresponding weights that denote the hardness of the vertices to be colored .",
    "this hardness is expressed by the penalty reward reflected in the objective function . in order to minimize this objective function , the graph - coloring algorithm ( greedy algorithm )",
    "directs itself to first color the vertices with higher values of weights .",
    "note that here the weights are modified adaptively .",
    "the results of the proposed self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm were compared with the results of three graph - coloring algorithms : saw - ea  @xcite , tabucol  @xcite and hea  @xcite .",
    "extensive experiments using these algorithms were conducted on a collection of random 3-colorable graphs generated by the culbersone graph generator  @xcite .",
    "the test suite used in the experiments was the same as in  @xcite because the dimacs challenge suite  @xcite , which was designed for testing graph @xmath3-coloring algorithms , does not contain 3-colorable graphs .",
    "our test suite satisfies two conditions :    * it comprises the instances of the random graphs in the phase transition  @xcite , where the graphs are really hard to color , * it enables the determination of how various structural features of the random graphs , e.g. , the graph size and type , the edge density , and the variability in sizes of color classes , influence the performance of the tested graph - coloring algorithms .    in summary ,",
    "the hybrid self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm incorporates three novelties : adaptation of weights representing the coefficients of the objective function in the dsatur algorithm , a new local search heuristic , and a new operator of the neutral survivor selection .",
    "although this approach recalls saw - ea , at least two differences can be exposed .",
    "the saw method adapts the coefficients of the objective function in the greedy coloring heuristic ( in contrast to the dsatur heuristic ) and is adaptive ( in contrast to self - adaptation ) .",
    "furthermore , while igel & taussaint  @xcite emphasize the significance of neutral mutation in evolution strategies , the proposed approach exploits this finding explicitly by creating the neutral survivor selection operator .",
    "the contribution of this evolutionary algorithm to the original dsatur algorithm was evaluated during the experimental work .",
    "the structure of the rest of this paper is as follows . in section 2 the problem of graph 3-coloring",
    "is formally defined .",
    "section 3 describes the structure of the hybrid self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm in detail .",
    "section 4 presents experiments and results on various classes of random graphs .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper by summarizing the work , the experimental results , and ideas for further work .",
    "let us assume an undirected graph @xmath0 , where @xmath1 represents the finite set of vertices @xmath11 and @xmath2 the finite set of unordered pairs @xmath12 named edges for @xmath13 , where , @xmath14 denotes the number of vertices .",
    "a graph 3-coloring is a mapping @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes a set of 3-colors . in other words , one of the three colors",
    "is assigned to each vertex of the graph @xmath4 .",
    "a proper 3-coloring is obtained if no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color  @xcite .",
    "3-gcp is a well - known _ constraint satisfaction problem _ ( csp )  @xcite convenient for solving with evolutionary algorithms .",
    "csp can be represented as a pair @xmath17 , where @xmath18 with @xmath16 denoting a _ search space _ , in which all solutions @xmath19 are _ feasible _ and @xmath20 a _ feasibility condition _ ,",
    "i.e. , a boolean function on @xmath21 , that is composed of constraints belonging to edges .",
    "that is , for each edge @xmath22 the corresponding constraint @xmath23 is defined by @xmath24 if and only if @xmath12 and @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the set of constraints involving variable @xmath27 ( edges connecting to node @xmath28 ) .",
    "then the feasibility condition is the conjunction of all constraints @xmath29 .",
    "note that the feasibility condition divides the search space into _ feasible _ and _ infeasible regions_.    constraints are usually handled in evolutionary algorithms indirectly through a penalty function that transforms the csp into the _",
    "free optimization problem _ ( fop )  @xcite .",
    "thus , those infeasible solutions that are far away from the feasible region are punished with higher penalties . the penalty function for 3-gcp that can also be used as an objective function is    @xmath30    where the function @xmath31 is defined as    @xmath32    the penalty function in eq .  [ eq:1 ] transforms the constraint satisfaction problem into a free optimization problem such that for each @xmath33 we have @xmath34 if and only if @xmath35 .",
    "[ eq:2 ] represents the feasibility condition and estimates the quality of candidate solution @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , eq .  [ eq:1 ] counts the number of vertices that violate the constraints as expressed by eq .",
    "the hybrid self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm ( hsa - ea ) for graph 3-coloring integrates concepts from various problem solving methods . as a base ,",
    "the self - adaptive evolution strategy  @xcite is used and then hybridized with heuristic genotype - phenotype mapping , a local search heuristic , and the neutral survivor selection .",
    "hsa - ea involves the following components and features :    * representation of individuals , * evaluation of objective function , * population model , * parent selection , * mutation operator , * survivor selection , * initialization procedure and * termination condition .    in this section",
    "these components and features are presented in detail .    in hsa - ea ,",
    "an individual @xmath37 consists of problem variables @xmath38 encoding the values of weights that determine the initial order in which the vertices are colored , and the control variables @xmath39 denoting the mutation strengths that are used by the operator of normally distributed mutation  @xcite .",
    "the number of variables @xmath40 is equivalent to the number of graph vertices .",
    "the problem variables can take the values from the domain @xmath41 , where @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "note that weights can not reach the value of zero because this value would imply that no constraints exist for the coloring of the corresponding vertex .",
    "the control variables can take the values @xmath43 $ ] , where the constant @xmath44 is a predefined minimum value of @xmath45 .",
    "the evaluation of the objective function value is based on eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] that counts the number of uncolored vertices .",
    "note that this function admits an occurrence of neutral solutions as well  @xcite .",
    "hsa - ea for graph 3-coloring uses the generational population model @xmath46 , where the whole population is replaced in each generation . specifically , @xmath47 selected parents produce @xmath48 offspring and the ratio @xmath49 is used , as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "an additional individual that represents the best solution found so far is added to the population of @xmath47 members .",
    "this solution is called the reference solution @xmath50 .",
    "the tournament selection is used as the parent selection operator and relies on the ordering relation that can rank any @xmath3 individuals  @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath3 represents the tournament size .    in self - adaptation , most frequently a normally distributed mutation  @xcite , is used that changes the weights as follows :    @xmath51    and    @xmath52    the mutation described in ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) is also called uncorrelated mutation with @xmath40 step sizes  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the weights @xmath53 of dimension @xmath40 , this kind of mutation requires the mutation strengths @xmath45 of the same dimension .",
    "the mutation strengths @xmath45 determine an area around the particular weight @xmath53 in which the search process could progress .",
    "the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 designate the learning rate  @xcite .",
    "the values for mutation strengths can be reduced to zero by the multiplication process in ( [ eq:4 ] ) . in that case , the evolutionary process stagnates .",
    "the following condition needs to be considered to prevent this event :    @xmath56    uncorrelated normally distributed mutation with @xmath40 step sizes can be described as a multiplicative process that decreases mutation strengths over generations .",
    "the mutation strengths determine how big change of weights can be made .",
    "the proper setting of the strengths has a great influence on the exploration of the search space .",
    "on the other hand , the parameter value depends on the number of generations . the higher the number of generations , the bigger the required initial mutation strengths .",
    "the neutral survivor selection operator was developed that represents the hybridization of this evolutionary algorithm and is presented in section  [ sec:3.4 ] .",
    "the solutions within the population are initialized randomly except for the first solution .",
    "for initialization of this solution , a heuristic initialization procedure is used that is explained latter in this section .",
    "the algorithm terminates when the maximum number of objective function evaluations is reached or a proper graph 3-coloring is found .      usually , the original problem context in evolutionary algorithm is distinguished from the search space , where the evolutionary process takes place  @xcite .",
    "candidate solutions in the original problem space are referred to as phenotypes , while their encodings form the genotypes and represent points in the search space .",
    "that is , candidate solutions need to be decoded from their representation , i.e. , mapped to the phenotype before they are evaluated .",
    "this mapping is also known as a genotype - phenotype mapping .",
    "note that genotype - phenotype mapping is not injective because several genotypes can be mapped into the same phenotype . in line with this",
    ", a lot of neutral solutions can appear .",
    "actually , the phenotypes only depend on problem variables , while control parameters determine the manner in which the genotype space is explored .",
    "it can be said that the control parameters describe the strategy for exploring the genotype space and can direct the evolutionary search to new undiscovered regions of the search space .",
    "this genotype - phenotype mapping consists of two steps : transformation of weights to the permutation of vertices and decoding of the solution by the dsatur algorithm . in the former step , from the encoded values of weights , i.e. , tuple @xmath57 , @xmath58 , where @xmath47 denotes the population size ,",
    "the initial permutation of the vertices is built @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "the permutation determines the ordering in which the vertices are colored .",
    "that is , the vertices are ordered according to the descending values of the corresponding weights .",
    "note that the mutation steps are not used in this transformation . in the latter step",
    ", the dsatur algorithm is taken as the construction heuristic by hsa - ea that from the permutation of vertices decodes a coloring @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "the order of coloring is determined by the dsatur heuristic , as follows :    1 .",
    "the heuristic selects the vertex with the highest saturation , and colors it with the lowest of the three colors . 2 .",
    "in the case of a tie , the heuristic selects the vertex with the maximal weight .",
    "3 .   in the case of a tie",
    ", the heuristic selects a vertex randomly .",
    "the main difference between this heuristic and the original dsatur algorithm is in the second step where the heuristic selects the vertices according to the weights instead of degrees .",
    "note that the genotype space determined by permutation of the vertices is huge , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , @xmath64 solutions can have equal values of the objective function because only @xmath40 values of the function exist according to eq .",
    "that is , many solutions with the same fitness value can arise that represent neutral networks  @xcite in the fitness landscape . on the other hand , the phenotype space is much smaller than the genotype space , namely @xmath65 .",
    "initially , the original dsatur algorithm orders the vertices @xmath66 , @xmath60 , of a given graph @xmath4 descending according to the vertex degrees @xmath67 that count the number of edges incident with vertex @xmath68  @xcite . to simulate the behavior of the original dsatur algorithm  @xcite ,",
    "the first solution in the population is initialized as follows : @xmath69 because the genotype is mapped into a permutation of weights , the same ordering is obtained as by the original dsatur , where the solution can be found in one step .",
    "experiments with self - adaptive evolutionary algorithms prove that a search can rapidly converge towards good areas of the search space ( exploration )  @xcite . during the exploitation phase ,",
    "these algorithms are less convenient because of the stochastic nature of the variation operators . in this phase ,",
    "improvement heuristics are useful that may improve current solutions with a more systematic search in their vicinity .",
    "local search  @xcite is the most often used kind of improvement heuristic that can incorporate problem - specific knowledge into the evolutionary algorithm .",
    "local search can be described as an iterative heuristic that explores a set of candidate solutions around the current solution ( also known as neighborhood ) and can replace the current solution with a better one , if it is found .",
    "a neighborhood of the current solution @xmath70 is a mapping @xmath71 , which for each solution @xmath72 defines a set @xmath73 of solutions that can be reached using a unary operator  @xcite .",
    "in fact , each solution in the neighborhood @xmath74 can be reached from the current solution @xmath70 in @xmath3 steps .",
    "therefore , this neighborhood is also called the @xmath3-opt neighborhood of the current solution @xmath70 .",
    "although various unary operators have been developed to be used with hsa - ea , experiments have shown that the best performance can be achieved by the unary operator termed the _ hybrid swap_. therefore , this operator was used in this work .",
    "the functioning of this operator is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : swap ] , which presents a solution to a graph @xmath4 with ten vertices .",
    "this solution is composed of a permutation of vertices @xmath75 , corresponding coloring @xmath76 , weights @xmath70 , and saturation degrees @xmath77 .",
    "the hybrid swap unary operator takes the first uncolored vertex in a solution and orders the predecessors according to the saturation degree , in descending order .",
    "the uncolored vertex is swapped with the vertex that has the highest saturation degree . in the case of a tie",
    ", the operator randomly selects a vertex among the vertices with higher saturation degrees .",
    "thus , the best neighbor of the current solution is determined by an exchange of two vertices ( @xmath78-opt neighborhood ) .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : swap ] , an element of the solution corresponding to the first uncolored vertex 4 is in dark grey and the vertices 0 and 3 with the highest saturation degree are in light grey . from vertices 0 and 3 , hybrid swap randomly selects vertex 0 and swaps it with vertex 4 ( the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : swap ] ) .",
    "a genotype diversity is one of the main prerequisites for efficient self - adaptation .",
    "the smaller genotypic diversity causes the population to be crowded within the search space . as a result , the search space is exploited . on the other hand ,",
    "the larger genotypic diversity causes the population to be better distributed over the search space and therefore , the search space is better explored  @xcite .",
    "the genotype diversity is explicitly maintained using the proposed neutral survivor selection that is inspired by the neutral theory of molecular evolution  @xcite .",
    "however , a measure is needed to determine the distance between solutions .",
    "an euclidian distance is the most appropriate when the solutions are represented as real - coded vectors .",
    "the euclidian distance between two vectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 is expressed as follows : @xmath81 a reference solution is needed to determine how the solutions are dissipated over the search space . for this reason , the current best solution @xmath50 in the population",
    "is used , as defined in subsection  [ ssec:3 ] .",
    "the operation of the neutral survivor selection is divided into two phases . during the first phase , in the population of @xmath48 offspring the evolutionary algorithm finds the set of the best neutral solutions @xmath82 .",
    "if the neutral solutions are better than , or equal , to the reference solution , i.e. , @xmath83 for @xmath84 , the reference solution @xmath50 is replaced by the neutral solution @xmath85 that is most distant from the reference solution according to eq .",
    "[ eq : euclid ] . in line with this",
    ", it is expected that the evolutionary search is directed towards new , undiscovered regions of the search space .",
    "conversely , if the neutral solutions are worse than the reference solution , the reference solution remains unchanged .    during the second phase ,",
    "the reference solution @xmath50 is used for determining the next population of survivors .",
    "for this purpose , the offspring are ordered according to the ordering relation @xmath86 ( read : is better than ) as follows : @xmath87    where the ordering relation @xmath86 is defined as    @xmath88    finally , for the next generation the evolutionary algorithm selects the best @xmath47 offspring according to eq .",
    "[ eq : order ] .",
    "these individuals take random positions in the next generation .",
    "like the neutral theory of molecular evolution , the neutral survivor selection offers three possible outcomes to offspring , as follows .",
    "first , the best offspring survive . additionally , the neutral solution that is the most distant from the reference solution becomes the new reference solution .",
    "second , the low - fitness offspring are usually eliminated from the population .",
    "third , all other solutions , that could be neutral as well , can survive if they take the first @xmath47 positions according to eq .",
    "[ eq : order ] .",
    "the goal of the experiments performed in this study was to compare the results of different graph 3-coloring algorithms and show that the performance of the proposed hsa - ea for graph 3-coloring is comparable with , or better than , the performance of other algorithms for solving this problem . here",
    ", the following algorithms were used :    * saw - ea  @xcite , * tabucol  @xcite , * hea  @xcite , * hsa - ea .",
    "an implementation of saw - ea can be found in  @xcite and is described in  @xcite .",
    "the tabucol and hea algorithms are among the best known algorithms for solving @xmath3-gcp  @xcite . in addition , implementations of both algorithms are publicly available for facilitating comparisons between newly developed algorithms  @xcite .",
    "although the implementation of tabucol , as presented in  @xcite , gained slightly better results than in  @xcite , the former implementation is not publicly available and , therefore , was not used in our study .",
    "the characteristics of hsa - ea used in the experiments were as follows .",
    "the fitness function according to eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] was considered by this algorithm .",
    "note that the fitness value can not exceed the number of vertices since the fitness function counts the number of vertices violating the constraints .",
    "this value , however , can not be higher than the number of all vertices .",
    "hsa - ea employed the selection scheme @xmath89 .",
    "that is , 100 candidate solutions were generated from the population of 15 parents , from which 15 fittest offspring were selected by the neutral survivor selection .",
    "although other selection schemes were also examined , the experiments showed that this selection scheme was the most effective .",
    "typically , a larger population requires higher initial mutation strengths .",
    "furthermore , a larger population can maintain higher diversity , but a smaller population converges faster than the larger one . in our opinion , this is due to the fact that the used predetermined number of evaluations is insufficient for the larger population to converge .",
    "experiments varying the tournament size showed that on average the best results are obtained using a tournament size of 3 .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of the experimental results proved that a tournament size of 3 is more appropriate for smaller populations ( such as in our case ) . as the population size grows , choosing a tournament size of 5 is more suitable .",
    "determination of initial mutation strengths was crucial for the performance of hsa - ea .",
    "after extensive experimentation , the initial mutation strength @xmath90 and @xmath91 produced the best results .",
    "as the termination condition , the number of function evaluations was limited to 300,000 , while the number of independent runs was fixed at 25 .",
    "the last two settings were the same as in  @xcite .",
    "the algorithms were compared according to two performance measures :    * success rate ( sr ) and * average number of objective function evaluations to solution ( aes ) .",
    "the former reflects the stochastic nature of hsa - ea and is defined as the ratio of successfully terminated runs , while the latter expresses the efficiency of a particular algorithm , and is defined as the number of objective function evaluations needed to find a solution .",
    "heuristics for solving the @xmath3-gcp are commonly compared on a set of graphs as proposed in the dimacs challenge suite  @xcite . however",
    ", this set does not permit the statistical study of relations between algorithm performance and the structural features of graphs  @xcite .",
    "the structural features of graphs may be induced by :    * generating a graph with a given number of color classes and edge densities , * influencing the variability in the sizes of the color classes .",
    "both presumptions can be satisfied using the culberson graph generator  @xcite .",
    "although this graph generator can generate various types of _ k_-colorable graphs , we focus on three specific types : uniform , equi - partite , and flat graphs .",
    "the type of graphs imposes an edge distribution by the graph generator as follows .",
    "uniform 3-colorable graphs are random graphs , where the vertices are randomly assigned to one of the three color classes uniformly and independently .",
    "the main property of equi - partite 3-colorable graphs is that the three color classes are as equal in size as possible .",
    "this type of graphs is less difficult to 3-color but difficult enough for many existing algorithms  @xcite .",
    "flat graphs seem the hardest to 3-color because besides the minimum variation in number of vertices in the three color classes the variation in degree for each node is also kept to minimum .",
    "random graphs are created using the parameter @xmath92 that controls the variability in sizes of the color classes .",
    "uniform @xmath93-colorable graphs are generated when @xmath94 as mentioned previously .",
    "variable @xmath93-colorable graphs are obtained when @xmath95 .",
    "graphs of this type are generated as follows .",
    "for each vertex in turn , the generator randomly selects an integer @xmath96 from the interval @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "then , this vertex is assigned to the color class @xmath28 that is randomly selected from the interval @xmath98 $ ] . in general ,",
    "variable @xmath93-colorable graphs are easier to color , as reported by turner  @xcite .",
    "the following parameters were used when generating the graphs : graph type , number of vertices , edge density controlled by the parameter @xmath99 determining the probability that two vertices @xmath27 and @xmath100 are connected with an edge @xmath101 , and the seed of the random graph generator . in general , these graphs can be denoted as @xmath102 , where _ t _ denotes the graph type ( i.e. , _ uni _ for uniform ( @xmath94 ) , _ eq _ for equi - partite , _ flat _ for flat ) , @xmath40 the number of vertices , @xmath99 the probability controlling the edge density , and @xmath103 the seed of the random graph generator .",
    "three types of uniform graphs were generated in order to investigate the influence of variability in sizes of the color classes on the algorithm results .",
    "when @xmath104 , the generated graphs have no variability in the sizes of the color classes ( the classes tend to be nearly equal in size , like in the equi - partite graphs ) , while when @xmath105 or @xmath106 , the sizes tend to vary considerably .",

    "<S> this paper proposes a hybrid self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm for graph coloring that is hybridized with the following novel elements : heuristic genotype - phenotype mapping , a swap local search heuristic , and a neutral survivor selection operator . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm was compared with the evolutionary algorithm with the saw method of eiben et al . , the tabucol algorithm of hertz and de werra , and the hybrid evolutionary algorithm of galinier and hao . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of these algorithms were tested on a test suite consisting of randomly generated 3-colorable graphs of various structural features , such as graph size , type , edge density , and variability in sizes of color classes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the test graphs were generated including the phase transition where the graphs are hard to color . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the extensive experimental work was threefold : to investigate the behavior of the tested algorithms in the phase transition , to identify what impact hybridization with the dsatur traditional heuristic has on the evolutionary algorithm , and to show how graph structural features influence the performance of the graph - coloring algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the performance of the hybrid self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm is comparable with , or better than , the performance of the hybrid evolutionary algorithm which is one of the best graph - coloring algorithms today . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the fact that all the considered algorithms performed poorly on flat graphs confirms that this type of graphs is really the hardest to color .    </S>",
