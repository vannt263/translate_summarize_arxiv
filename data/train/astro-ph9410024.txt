    "these fluctuations become large in the present epoch .",
    "as the universe expands , these perturbations are redshifted to longer wavelengths and amplified ; during the present epoch these perturbations typically persist over a range of wavelengths @xmath1 from @xmath2 . for a review of perturbations in inflationary models ,",

    "hence they may also be thought of as classical gravitational waves - the two descriptions coincide .",
    "the gravitons are created during the de sitter phase of rapid expansion by the mechanism originally proposed by parker ; the same mechanism creates particles near a black hole or in any other region where the spacetime curvature is large and particle creation is not forbidden by global symmetries or conservation laws . a simple calculation showing how a potentially - observable spectrum of gravitons is created in inflation",

    "the most recent phase was a matter - dominated period of expansion , described by the scale factor @xmath35 here the constants @xmath36 are defined by @xmath37 during this matter - dominated phase , the stress - energy tensor is that of a perfect fluid , with zero pressure and an energy density proportional to @xmath38 .",

    "it may be easily verified that the scale factor and its derivative w.r.t .",

    "as the time coordinate increases , the scale factor decreases , eventually reaching a minimum value when @xmath58 . after this time , the scale factor begins to increases again ( exponentially in physical time ) .",

    "there is a sense in which the spatially - closed inflationary models are not  natural . \"",
    "one of the principal motivations which led to the development of the inflationary paradigm was the desire to solve the so - called  horizon problem . \"",
    "as we will now show , this problem is only solved ( for reasonable choices of the cosmological parameters ) if @xmath71 .",
    "thus , while it is technically consistent to use the results obtained in this paper for any value of @xmath72 , one must bear in mind that the cosmological model , for large values of @xmath0 , runs counter to the spirit of inflation .",
    "the horizon problem may be stated in terms of a set of points c , which is the intersection of the past horizon of an observer today with the surface of last scattering .",
    "the horizon problem is  solved \" if c lies within the causal domain of influence of either ( 1 ) a point on the initial singularity , in a big bang model , or ( 2 ) a point on the surface at @xmath73 where inflation  begins \" , in a model with no initial singularity .",
    "thus , in our model , which is of type ( 2 ) , the horizon problem is solved if and only if @xmath74 for reasonable cosmological models , the terms containing @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 may be neglected .",
    "the horizon problem is then solved if and only if @xmath78 while we present results for any value of @xmath0 , the cosmological model itself should be viewed with some suspicion if @xmath0 is much larger than unity .",

    "it will turn out that @xmath82 is independent of @xmath31 , and depends only upon the dimensionless quantities @xmath0 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",

    "in addition , if @xmath77 is sufficiently large then the @xmath82 are also independent of its value .",
    "if the metric perturbation @xmath29 vanishes and the temperature of the cbr on the surface of last scattering is constant , an observer today would see exactly the same temperature at each point on the celestial sphere , and @xmath11 would vanish .",
    "however the metric perturbations will in general break the rotational symmetry and perturb the energy of the photons .",
    "this results in a temperature fluctuation which varies from point to point on the celestial sphere ; the fluctuation may be calculated in the same way as for a spatially - flat universe , given in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the observer is located at @xmath34 , and at `` radial '' coordinate @xmath86 .",

    "we have chosen the ( non - affine ) parameter @xmath1 along the null geodesic path to run through the range @xmath91 between the time of last scattering and the observation today .    in the presence of the metric perturbation @xmath29",

    "the basic idea is that the inflationary epoch redshifts away all the perturbations , with the exception of the zero - point quantum fluctuations .",

    "<S> we calculate the multipole moments of the correlation function for these temperature fluctuations in a spatially - closed friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared to the corresponding multipoles in the spatially - flat case . </S>",
    "<S> the differences are small unless the density parameter today , @xmath0 , is greater than 2 . </S>"
