    "analogues of the gauss equation , governing the passage of curvature bounds to subspaces from ambient spaces , tend to be challenging in alexandrov spaces .",
    "for instance , a major unsolved problem in the theory of spaces of curvature bounded below is whether the boundary of a convex set inherits the curvature bound .",

    ", we may start with the knowledge that @xmath4 has some upper curvature bound , and with lytchak s idea of bounding the extrinsic curvature of two nearby @xmath4-geodesics in their ambient ruled surface by projecting to @xmath4 @xcite . obtaining a sharp bound for this curvature ( step 2 below )",

    "equation ( [ eq : discrep ] ) holds because the @xmath4-geodesic @xmath54 is no longer than the curve @xmath58 with the same endpoints .    in seeking a sharp bound ,",
    "we exploit estimates from a globalization theorem for arc / chord curvature in @xcite ( theorem [ thm : cbc1 ] below ) . in consequence ( lemma [ lem : ubproj ] below ) , we obtain a bound for @xmath59 which in combination with equation ( [ eq : discrep ] ) yields an upper curvature bound for @xmath4 of @xmath20 .",
    "in other words , it turns out that equation ( [ eq : discrep ] ) is too weak to give the gauss equation we seek ; a factor of @xmath28 is needed on the lefthand side .",
    "figure [ fig : lunes ] suggests where to look for this factor of @xmath28 .",

    "indeed , this is what we prove .",
    "we use a version for cat(@xmath0 ) spaces ( lemma [ lem : shrink ] below ) of a standard lemma in smooth comparison geometry .",
    "the latter is a length comparison between two curves with the same expression in fermi coordinates , in ruled surfaces generated by vector fields that are parallel along and orthogonal to two base geodesics ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  corollary of rauch ii  , p. 31 - 32 ) ) . for the longer of the two curves ,",
    "the parallel condition can be dropped , since allowing the ruled surface generators to `` twist '' as they move along the base geodesic only lengthens a curve with given fermi coordinates .",
    "the remaining steps in the proof of theorem [ thm : gausseq ] are :    * step . *",
    "the distance between the respective chords in @xmath50 of two subarcs of @xmath47 and @xmath46 is @xmath61-convex . adding to this the width estimates that follow from step 2 , we find that @xmath62 satisfies the @xmath63-convexity midpoint inequality .",
    "the usual behavior of normal and tangential jacobi field lengths extends to cba spaces .",
    "normal jacobi field lengths along @xmath47 are @xmath64-convex and so , by a development argument , @xmath4 has cba by @xmath24 .    in @xcite ,",
    "jacobi fields were studied in riemannian manifolds with boundary , which form a class of cba spaces by alexander et al .",
    "@xcite . in step 4",
    ", we must capture the notion of normal and tangential jacobi fields lengths in the general cba setting .",
    "this is because tangential ones , which are linear , must be discarded in order to identify negative curvature bounds .    throughout",
    ", we may apply the following globalization theorem to @xmath4-geodesics , which have extrinsic curvature @xmath1 in @xmath3 because @xmath4 does .",
    "the _ base angles _ of an arc @xmath46 are the angles it makes with its chord at their common endpoints , and the _ width _ of @xmath46 is the smallest tubular radius containing @xmath46 about the chord .",
    "a _ @xmath65-curve _ in @xmath18 is a curve of constant extrinsic curvature @xmath65 ; thus a complete @xmath65-curve is a circle , geodesic line , horocycle or equidistant curve .",
