    "the role of the gluon field in determining the interactions between nucleons and quark - antiquark ( @xmath12 ) systems , which do not share the same @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks with the nucleon , is one of the interesting subjects in understanding quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) . an important step toward this direction",
    "was taken by peskin@xcite who applied the methodology of the operator product expansion to evaluate the strength of the color field emitted by heavy @xmath12 systems .",
    "his results suggested@xcite that the van der waals force induced by the color field of @xmath0 on nucleons can generate an attractive short - range @xmath0-@xmath15 interaction . by using the effective field theory method ,",
    "luke , manohar , and savage@xcite used the results from peskin to predict the @xmath0-nucleon forward scattering amplitude which was used to get an estimation that @xmath0 can have a few mev / nucleon attraction in nuclear matter .",
    "brodsky and miller@xcite further investigated the @xmath0-n forward scattering amplitude of ref.@xcite to derive a @xmath0-n potential ( @xmath5 ) which gives an @xmath0-n scattering length of -@xmath16 fm .",
    "the result of peskin was also used by kaidalov and volkovitsky@xcite , who differed from ref.@xcite in evaluating the gluon content in the nucleon , to give a much smaller scattering length of -@xmath17 fm . in a lattice qcd calculation ,",
    "kawanai and saski@xcite obtained an attractive @xmath0-n potential @xmath18 - @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 gev , which gives a scattering length - @xmath22 fm . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "brodsky , schmidt and de teramond proposed an approach to calculate the potential between a @xmath23 meson and a nucleus by using the pomeon - exchange model of dannachie and lanshoff@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-n potential obtained in this approach is @xmath18 - @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath21 gev which gives a rather large scattering length - @xmath26 fm .",
    "our first objective in this paper is to explore whether these @xmath0-n potentials , with rather different attractive strengths , can form @xmath0-nucleus bound states . following the well developed method in nuclear reaction theory@xcite ,",
    "this is done by searching for bound states by solving the schrodinger equation with a folding potential constructed by integrating the @xmath0-n potential over the nuclear density .",
    "we will also consider the approach of ref.@xcite in predicting @xmath0-nucleus bound states by the coherent sum of pomeon - exchange between quarks in @xmath0 and all quarks in the nucleus .",
    "for each of the predicted bound @xmath2_{j/\\psi}$ ] systems , we then estimate the photo - production cross section of the @xmath27_{j/\\psi } + n$ ] reaction to facilitate future experimental investigations@xcite .",
    "the second part of this work is motivated by the investigations by brodsky and de teramond@xcite who found that the spin correlation of @xmath28 elastic scattering near the @xmath0 production threshold can be explained if one postulates the excitation of a hidden charm ( @xmath29 ) state @xmath30 .",
    "based on the similar consideration on the role of multi - quark configurations , brodsky , chudakov , hoyer , and laget@xcite suggested in a study of @xmath31 reaction that @xmath0 can interact strongly with the six - quark @xmath7 $ ] component of the deuteron wavefunction because the octet 3-quark @xmath32_8 $ ] in the @xmath7 $ ] can directly interact with each quark in @xmath0 .",
    "these two works suggest the possibility that if @xmath0 overlap with a @xmath7 $ ] cluster in nuclei , a bound @xmath7_{j/\\psi}$ ] system could be formed .",
    "it is of course very difficult , if not impossible , to estimate @xmath7$]-@xmath33 interaction .",
    "instead , we will simply assume the existence of such states and use the previous works@xcite on quark clusters in nuclei to explore how the cross sections of @xmath9_{j/\\psi } + n$ ] depend on the parameters characterizing the @xmath7$]-@xmath33 interaction within a potential model .",

    "one expects that mechanisms other than pomeron - exchange could also contribute as can be seen in the exclusive @xmath35 photo - production reaction on the nucleon@xcite .",
    "however , very little investigation has been done for @xmath0 photo - production in the near threshold region . as a first step , we will only consider the meson - exchange mechanism which can be calculated from using the partial decay width of @xmath36 listed by particle data group@xcite ( pdg ) . with the vector meson dominance ( vdm ) assumption , this observed decay process indicates that @xmath0 photo - production can also be due to the exchanges of a @xmath37 meson with the nucleon , as illustrated in part ( b ) of fig.[fig : pom - mec ] .",
