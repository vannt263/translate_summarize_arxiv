    "ring galaxies are galaxies which present a very unusual morphology in that rings are observed as dominating parts of their structures . they could be systems with rings surrounding early - type galaxies , such as the hoag s object or polar ring galaxies ( hoag 1950 ; wakamatsu 1990 ) .",
    "they could also be those systems in that the main disk of spiral galaxies are dominated by a ring centered on a nucleus .",
    "this paper focuses on the second type , which is as those presented in the catalog of madore et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "although the secular processes through the bars might be responsible for some of the ring structures in spiral galaxies , the galactic interactions through collisions or merging are the main picture to describe the formation of ring galaxies .",
    "the head - on collisions were first proposed by lynds & toomre ( 1976 ) to be the mechanism to produce ring galaxies .",
    "the analytic model of these kinds of collisions employing the caustic wavefronts of stellar rings was developed in struck - marcell ( 1990 ) and struck - marcell & lotan ( 1990 ) .",
    "later , gerber et al . (",
    "1992 ) studied the formation of empty rings , which are those systems without nuclei such as arp 147 .",
    "they produced c - shape structures and found that the remnant nucleus is offset from the center and out of the original plane in their simulations .",
    "moreover , wong et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggested that a high - speed off - center collision can explain their observational results of ngc 922 .",
    "interestingly , elmegreen & elmegreen ( 2006 ) showed that some ring galaxies with features of collisional rings have no obvious companions .",
    "it is thus unclear whether these ring galaxies could be explained by the collision scenario or not .",
    "motivated by this controversial result , wu & jiang ( 2012 ) picked up some observed axisymmetric ring galaxies from the catalog of madore et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and demonstrated through n - body simulations that head - on collisions could produce the structures of these axisymmetric rings .",
    "they thus claimed that the identified off - center companions around the ring galaxies might not be relevant to the rings .",
    "the dwarf galaxy which collided with the disk galaxy along the symmetric axis was already mixed with the center of the disk galaxy and became parts of a nucleus of this ring galaxy .    while these results were presented in iau symposium ( wu & jiang 2011 ) , in addition to our paper wu & jiang ( 2012 ) , there were several recent works , such as smith et al .",

    "smith et al .",
    "( 2012 ) modeled the formation of auriga s wheel ring galaxy using n - body simulations .",
    "they proposed that auriga s wheel was formed by the collision of a spiral galaxy and an elliptical galaxy .",
    "mapelli & mayer ( 2012 ) investigated the formation of empty ring galaxies , which were considered as collisional ring galaxies without nuclei inside the ring .",
    "fiacconi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) explored parameters of galactic collisions and paid attention to the relation between the star formation rate and different parameters . however , the association between different parameters and the shape of the ring galaxies was not clear .    indeed , as those observed non - axisymmetric rings shown in madore et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , it is confirmed that not only the shape of rings could be elliptical , but also that the nucleus could be offset from the center of rings .",
    "these complexities are likely due to the details of the collisional history .",
    "the interesting questions would be : what kinds of relative orbits between the dwarf and main disk galaxies could lead to these structures ?    in order to answer the above question , the link between the merging processes and the shapes of rings needs to be constructed .",
    "once this link is established , through the observations of ring systems , one can investigate the merging histories of galaxies and therefore constrain the cosmology .    to achieve this goal ,",
    "we here employ n - body simulations to investigate the formation of ring galaxies through non - axisymmetric collisions .",
    "the collisions of two galaxies would be set up by making the initial velocity of the dwarf be inclined from the symmetric axis of the main disk galaxy . to narrow down the parameter space and",
    "focus on the inclination angle , the dwarf galaxy is assumed to be moving on a parabolic orbit and directly towards to the center of the disk galaxy .",
    "moreover , in order to describe the resulting ring , we develop a new procedure to determine the eccentricities of rings and the nucleus offset . with these quantitative description",
    ", we will be able to study the relation between the shapes of rings and the inclinations of galactic collisions .    in the following sections ,",

    "all parameters of the disk galaxy are the same as those in wu & jiang ( 2012 ) , except that the number of particles is increased five times and the stellar bulge is added .",
    "the total masses of the stellar disk and dark halo are exactly the same as the values used in hernquist ( 1993 ) , which are from the mass model of a sb type spiral galaxy .",

    "the spherical components ( the stellar bulge and the dark halo ) and non - spherical component ( the stellar disk ) of the disk galaxy are set up separately , and are combined together to be the disk galaxy model .",

    "the virial theorem is used to check whether the disk galaxy is already in a new equilibrium .",

    ", it can be seen that the disk galaxy approaches a new equilibrium at t = 15@xmath23 .",

    "after the first collision , some dwarf s stellar particles get trapped near the center of the disk galaxy , some have gone very far from the cores of both galaxies , and a certain fraction of particles follow the orbit of the dwarf galaxy . comparing fig . 5 with fig .",
    "3 , it is obvious that the ring is mainly made of particles originally belonging to the disk galaxy . in the end , at @xmath57 , the disk galaxy and the dwarf galaxy merge .    in general , when a satellite galaxy falls into a major galaxy , the satellite experiences the dynamical friction from the stars and halo of the major galaxy .",

    "the procedure is described below with an example demonstrated in fig . [ fig3:fitring ] .",
    "first , the stellar components of the disk galaxy , including the bulge and the stellar disk , are projected on the @xmath49 plane .",
    "then , we divide the space into small square cells , and calculate the projected density of the particles within each cell . the size of each cell is 0.2 kpc @xmath58 0.2 kpc .",
    "after that , taking the center of the cell which has the highest projected density as the coordinate center , we divide the space equally into 36 cells in the azimuthal direction as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig3:fitring ] ( b ) , it shows that @xmath59 increases rapidly within 0.5 kpc and then slows down from 0.5 to 1.5 kpc .",
    "after @xmath61 1.5 kpc , @xmath59 increases rapidly again until r@xmath624 kpc .",
    "obviously , the concentration in the galactic center produces the rapid increment of @xmath59 within 0.5 kpc , and the existence of a ring explains another rapid increment between 1.5 and 4 kpc .    to identify the ring region precisely , the slope of the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3:fitring ] ( b ) is plotted as a function of @xmath60 as shown in fig . [ fig3:fitring ] ( c ) .",

    "the red triangle labels the maximum of the slope , @xmath64 , which should be located within the central part of the ring region . between the disk center and the ring region ,",
    "the blue triangle labels the minimum of the slope , @xmath65 .",

    "the above is done for all 36 azimuthal cells .",

    "for example , the lifetime of the ring in si60 is only 2@xmath78 , that is from @xmath79=60 to @xmath79=62@xmath78 .",
    "to understand the effect of the inclination angle on the semi - major axis of the ring , the ring in si00 is used as a standard .",

    "in fact , as we can see in panel ( c ) , all simulations with inclination angle smaller than 15 degrees present very similar results and to distinguish them is beyond the scope of this paper .    on the other hand , because @xmath71 increases with time , the out - moving speed @xmath82 of the semi - major axis , @xmath71 , is defined as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the variation of the semi - major axis within one @xmath78 from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",

    "besides , for all simulations , the offset @xmath76 is larger at the beginning and then becomes smaller at @xmath87 .",
    "this is because at the beginning of the collision , the disk center moves towards @xmath54 direction and gets closer to the boundary of the ellipse , as the example shown in fig .",
