    "the energy levels of non spin - split fe and cr _ d _ states are found to be within an energy window 0.5 ev , causing near degeneracy between the levels , while the fe and sc levels are found to be energetically separated by about 2 ev or more .    .",

    "the strength of the spin - orbit interaction depends on the energy level separation ( @xmath39 ) between fe _ e _ and _ t@xmath3_. we have estimated @xmath39 from the nmto- downfolding calculations in the effective fe only basis , and obtain@xcite @xmath40 ev for fss and @xmath41 ev for fcs . using second order perturbation theory@xcite as considered in ref .",

    "we found that this originates from the difference in the hybridization between fe _ d _ states and b ( b = cr / sc ) states and s @xmath2 states .",
    "this not only affects the magnitude of magnetic exchanges , but also the relative importance of different magnetic exchanges : a contrasting value of j2/j1 of 37 in the case of the sc compound to a value of 0.4 in the case of the cr compound .",
    "moreover , the j s are antiferromagnetic for the sc systems and ferromagnetic for the cr system .",
    "this leads to important frustration effects in the sc compound which are absent in the cr compound . in our entire analysis",
