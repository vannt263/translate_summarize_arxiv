    "article interferometry has yielded numerous important results from the advent of quantum mechanics until now ; counting only the most recent ones , they range from precision measurements @xcite , fundamental tests of quantum mechanics @xcite , to applications in optical and superconducting magnetometry @xcite .",
    "while other architectures provide a natural way to engineer , guide and confine interfering paths , e.g. , by means of optical waveguides for photons or superconducting circuits for electrons , one key challenge for atoms consists in realizing a flexible platform that is capable of providing complex interfering geometries where the atoms remain localized at all times .",
    "unprecedented control over atomic states has been obtained in optical lattice potentials : designed to mimic solid state systems they resemble engineered circuits . in order to construct interfering paths in these systems ,",
    "an additional quantum number is needed  that has to be decoupled from motional states  for the atomic wave packet s motion to be steered in a coherent and state - dependent manner .",
    "this is achieved by leaving the simple scalar concept of an atom and taking advantage of its vector nature endowed by electronic and nuclear spin .",
    "mediated by the spin - orbit interaction , optical dipole forces yield a state dependent force , offering the right `` handle '' for steering atomic paths .",
    "therefore , an effective magnetic field coupled to the atomic magnetic moment makes position control of the interfering paths possible , albeit at the expense of an increased sensitivity to magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "even though this is not a fundamental limitation , it represents a technical hurdle that demands efficient shielding against stray magnetic field fluctuations ; accepting this price , digital engineering of atomic paths in optical potentials can bring atom interferometry to a new level of control .",
    "particle localization and digital reprogrammability of atomic paths , besides being necessary resources in quantum technologies , e.g. , for quantum cellular automata @xcite and multi - particle entanglement @xcite , specify also the application range where trapped - atom interferometers could outperform other interferometers in precision measurements . in general ,",
    "to measure constant homogeneous potential gradients the figure of merit is the space - time area enclosed by the atomic paths , and the ultimate precision is fixed by shot noise as standard quantum limit . while space - time areas achieved by free - fall atom interferometers , e.g. , of about @xmath2 in @xcite , are in principle reachable by our interferometer , and at the moment",
    "only technically limited , the prime advantage in having trapped atoms resides in the nanoscale spatial resolution , allowing non - destructive probing of microscopic atomic quantum systems and measuring potential gradients at ultrashort scale .",
    "atom interferometers operate by splitting the wavefunction of an atom onto two spatially separated paths , and measuring their phase difference @xcite . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a this requires preparing the atom in a quantum superposition of states ; these are subsequently delocalized and eventually coherently recombined to probe the phase difference accumulated between the two paths .",
    "our interferometer uses two long - lived internal states of cold caesium atoms , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "while these internal states are coherently manipulated by means of microwave pulses , the particle position is controlled by trapping atoms in a 1d  optical lattice with spacing @xmath5  nm .",
    "the spin - dependent control is realized through a @xmath6-@xmath7-@xmath6 configuration of the optical lattice , which allows atoms to move in discrete steps in a direction dependent on the spin state @xmath8 , @xmath9 by ramping the polarization angle @xmath7 ( see methods ) @xcite .",
    "when a superposition of the two spin states is created by a @xmath10 pulse , the trapped atom is delocalized by a single step in a fully coherent manner . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , shift operations of alternated direction are interleaved with @xmath11 pulses to further separate the paths . up to 100 block operations",
    "can be concatenated in one coherent digital chain , eventually achieving coherent separations larger than 10 @xmath12 m , as shown in fig .",
    "the tight confinement by the lattice potential ensures that each wavefunction s component is axially strongly localized in space , down to @xmath13 nm , achieving at the same time nanoscale positioning control and mesoscopic spatial separation .    in order to extract the interferometric phase difference @xmath14 between the two paths ,",
    "we employ a ramsey probing scheme where the final merging block maps the phase information onto the two spin populations by means of a @xmath10 pulse of variable phase @xmath15 . scanning the phase varies the probability to detect @xmath16 @xmath17,\\ ] ] @xmath18 being the probability of an atom escaping from the trap during the interferometer sequence , and @xmath19 the ramsey fringe contrast .",
    "when the interferometer is operated with a single atom , detecting the presence of the atom in , e.g. , @xmath16 state results in a @xmath20 binary signal at each run of the sequence , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d . unlike with large ensembles of atoms , to measure the underlying probability distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig1]e multiple repetitions are here averaged in time .",
    "the geometry of the interferometer is determined by the programmed sequence of operation blocks . the elementary `` diamond '' geometry , which resembles the classic mach - zehnder interferometer , maximizes the sensitivity of the interferometric phase to potential gradients . varying",
    "the size of the diamond reveals how phase and coherence of the superposition state evolve with the number of shifts .",
    "[ fig2]a shows a strong parabolic phase accumulation , which we can track over 11@xmath11 radians .",
    "such a phase behavior is expected in the presence of a linear potential gradient @xmath21 , as it can be interpreted as the gradient strength times the spacetime `` area '' that the paths enclose .",
    "the accumulated phase will then follow @xmath22,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath23 being the total number of shift operations , @xmath24 the duration of a shift block , and @xmath25 the duration of a @xmath11 pulse , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 the coordinate along the left and right path , respectively . the phase evolution in eq .",
    "[ eqdiamphase ] has been fitted to fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , indicating a potential gradient of @xmath28 , equivalent in magnitude to a gravitational acceleration of @xmath29 .",
    "we attribute this gradient to a displacement of the lattice laser focus from the position of the atoms by @xmath30 m , about a quarter of the rayleigh length ; the beam s divergence leads to a reduction of the optical trap depth further away from the focus , thus creating a potential gradient which is nearly linear over the experimental region of @xmath31 m .",
    "this is supported by the direct proportionality measured between the gradient strength and the trapping laser s power , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2]a .",
    "in order to cancel the phase caused by such a background gradient , we consider a `` double diamond '' geometry , consisting of two basic diamond interferometers interspaced with a @xmath11 pulse , see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b . by crossing the paths in the middle of the sequence , the second loop accumulates",
    "a phase opposite to the first loop , and cancellation occurs akin to a spin echo .",
    "this `` geometric '' spin echo is effective for any spin- and time - independent potential .",
    "gradients which are active only for one half of the sequence are still detected as described above , making the double diamond interferometer suitable to measure time - controllable gradients in a differential scheme .",
    "the successful suppression of the parabolic phase is visible in fig .",
    "to mitigate decoherence effects the interferometer block chain is assembled such that each subsequence of shift , @xmath11 pulse , shift operations achieves on its own a spin echo refocusing , compensating spin - dependent inhomogeneous disturbances ; such repeated spin echoes are reminiscent of dynamical decoupling @xcite .",
    "[ fig2]c shows an exponential decay of contrast for increasing interferometer size , which we observed for both interferometer geometries .",
    "this behavior indicates that identically repeated operation blocks are subject to an invariable decoherence per block , suggesting the number of shifts as the relevant quantity for contrast .    to isolate the cause of this decay , we repeat the same sequence replacing all the shift operations by idle blocks , and fit the contrast decay with an exponential curve ( dashed line ) showing a contrast loss of 0.6% per step",
    "this is dominated by time - varying differential light shift due to fluctuations of the lattice laser power ; in addition , since spin - dependent transport excludes the use of clock states , a minor contribution from magnetic field fluctuations is also expected .",
    "the significantly lower decay rate without delocalization on the lattice ( dark green area ) indicates that most decoherence in the interferometer takes place due to shift operations ( light green area ) .",
    "we hence measure independently the transport efficiency per single shift step @xmath32 using methods of @xcite , and , after preparing atoms in the axial motional ground state @xcite , we achieve 99% success probability for shifting the atom in the correct direction , limited by the efficiency of the microwave pulses . accounting for this probability once per shift and per path , the shift - free decay rate is combined with a further 2% contrast drop per step to produce the dash - dotted curve in fig . 2c .",
    "we attribute the residual 1.7% contrast drop per step to polarization jitter during shift operations and , to a smaller extent , to spurious motional excitations .",
    "one distinguished feature of a trapped particle interferometer is the ability to insert an arbitrary hold time @xmath33 in between blocks , where the interferometer is held open at a fixed separation .",
    "this becomes relevant when the interferometer is to be operated near an object of study , with long interaction time and nanoscale control of distance , e.g. , a surface or even a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the natural place to insert a hold time is at maximum separation of the paths , see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ; this situation is investigated in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b for sequences of @xmath34 , 8 and 12 shifts where the interferometric phase is measured varying @xmath33 . in the presence of a potential gradient",
    "an additional phase @xmath35 arises from the spacetime area added by the hold time , on top of the phase in eq .",
    "[ eqdiamphase ] .",
    "a linear fit yields a potential gradient of @xmath36 hz/@xmath37 , in full agreement with the results in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    to protect the superposition state from dephasing during the hold time",
    "two @xmath11 pulses are applied , realizing a two - fold spin echo refocusing , see fig .",
    "the fact that the phase @xmath38 survives spin echoes confirms the spin - independent nature of the potential gradient , as expected from such a light shift gradient . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c , the contrast as a function of the hold time reveals a gaussian decay @xcite on a time scale comparable to that of non - transported atoms .",
    "an important application of atom interferometry is the measurement of external forces .",
    "we demonstrate this by applying a controlled inertial force by accelerating the whole lattice potential during a fixed acceleration time @xmath39 ( see methods ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , the paths are then recombined in the moving inertial frame , and the effect of the force @xmath40 is measured from the interferometric phase , with @xmath41 the atomic mass and @xmath42 the applied acceleration .",
    "we employ the simplest geometry of the single diamond and find that the phase linearly increases with the applied acceleration @xmath42 with a slope proportional to path separation , see fig .",
    "[ fig4]b . calculating the spacetime area in this case",
    "yields a phase of @xmath43 for @xmath23 total shifts , where @xmath42 is independently calibrated .",
    "the agreement up to @xmath44  only technically limited  together with the achieved precision of @xmath45 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] demonstrate the ability of the single atom interferometer to measure external fields in real applications , showing a dynamic range of at least 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "pulses during the hold time form a double spin - echo sequence ; all idle blocks have identical duration . *",
    "b ) * the hold time contributes an additional phase @xmath38 , increasing linearly with @xmath33 with the slopes proportional to path separation .",
    "the intercepts of the fitting lines have been subtracted to set the phase to zero in the origin .",
    "* c ) * the contrast reveals a gaussian decay with hold time .",
    "this dependency on the echo duration is characteristic of homogeneous dephasing mechanisms which are not compensated by spin echo pulses @xcite ; it differs from the exponential decay in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c where the number of echo pulses is varied .",
    "error bars show one sem uncertainty . ]",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated an atom interferometer operating at the single atom level ; we proved its capability to measure external fields  both the divergence of an optical dipole trap and an externally - controlled inertial force  achieving a resolution which borders precision applications . by exploiting the block modularity",
    "we could precisely identify the decoherence mechanisms and explain the loss of contrast in terms of decoherence per shift operation . yet",
    ", the full digital control established here allowed us to suppress decoherence effects by engineering the interferometer s paths to effect a geometrical refocussing .    in the quest for quantum devices functioning at the single - atom level , from rydberg quantum logic gates @xcite to single - site - resolved optical lattices @xcite",
    ", our results lay the base for digital quantum simulators @xcite and quantum cellular automata @xcite based on interacting atoms in lattice potentials @xcite .",
    "similarly , scalable arrays of quantum logic gates with single atom addressing are also within reach @xcite .",

    "furthermore , an implementation of conveyor belts for spin - dependent optical lattices is currently underway , with which we expect to reach coherent splitting distances of the order of @xmath47 @xcite . combining this with a hold - time scheme for interrogation in decoherence - protected clock states , we deem realistic an improvement of space - time area by a factor @xmath48 over the present situation , eventually rivaling in precision free - fall atom interferometers .     for a duration of @xmath49s ; the paths are merged while in the inertial frame at velocity @xmath50 . *",
