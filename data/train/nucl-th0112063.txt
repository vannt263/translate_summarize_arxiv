    "@xcite was very successful in the explanation of the properties of different s- and p - wave multipole amplitudes for @xmath8 in the near threshold region .",
    "the process of @xmath0 electro - production on protons @xcite , @xmath11 , opens also new interesting possibilities due to the longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon and the non - trivial dependence of the multipole amplitudes on the momentum transfer squared , @xmath12 from the initial to the scattered electron .",
    "but last data @xcite show a serious discrepancy with the calculation in the framework of heavy baryon chpt @xcite .    for a further test of different models , which can be applied to pion photo- and electro - production ,",
    "the information about the amplitudes of the processes @xmath13 and @xmath14 is essential .",
    "the deuteron processes @xmath1 and @xmath2 seem well adapted for this aim , as , in impulse approximation ( ia ) , the corresponding matrix elements are determined by the coherent sum of amplitudes for elementary processes @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 is the virtual photon .",
    "however , since , in the threshold region , these amplitudes are small in comparison with the amplitudes of @xmath18 photoproduction on nucleons , rescattering effects , ( re ) due to the following two - step processes : @xmath19 can be , in principle , strongly competitive with the direct @xmath0-production from a single nucleon [ 12 - 19 ] .",
    "if it is the case , the reaction @xmath1 can not allow a direct and model independent extraction of the elementary neutron amplitudes .",
    "a dedicated experiment @xcite , with a tagged photon beam , was devoted to measurements of the cross section and of the angular distribution for the inclusive @xmath0-production in the @xmath20 reaction in the near threshold region .",
    "inelastic contributions , due to the deuteron disintegration , @xmath21 could not be resolved in the experiment , and their contribution was estimated through a theoretical model . it was shown that the electric dipole amplitude @xmath9 for the @xmath22 process ( which is proportional to the amplitude referred later on as @xmath23 ) can be determined with good accuracy .",
    "the data are characterized by a large backward - forward asymmetry of the angular @xmath0-distribution .",
    "the deduced @xmath9 amplitude , has a negative sign , relative to the definite combination of p - wave amplitudes , which is determined from a theory for @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath9 amplitude for @xmath1 is certainly sensitive to the the @xmath9 amplitude for @xmath25 , but the quantitative determination of this last amplitude depends essentially on re .",
    "the negative sign for @xmath26 was considered as a confirmation of the validity of chpt predictions for @xmath27 , and of the important role of re .",
    "coherent @xmath0 threshold electro - production on the deuteron at @xmath12=0.1 gev@xmath28 has been studied by the a1 collaboration at the mainz microtron mami , with @xmath29-excitation energy up to @xmath30 w = 4 mev @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal threshold amplitude , which was extracted by the rosenbluth fit is smaller ( in absolute value ) by a factor two than the value predicted by chpt calculations .",
    "the discrepancy at the level of the cross section is of one order of magnitude .",
    "note , in this connection , that the existing calculations of re give very different quantitative predictions .",
    "these effects are very sensitive to many ingredients of the corresponding model , as , for example , the short distance behavior of the deuteron wave function , the shape of the pion propagator in the intermediate state , the choice of the operator for the elementary process @xmath27 , the procedure of integration ( for example in @xcite a six fold integration was done ) etc . the accuracy of assumptions and simplifications in the theoretical calculations can not be easily controlled",

    "our main aim here is to demonstrate that for the threshold @xmath31state @xmath0-meson production in processes @xmath32 and @xmath2 the application of pauli principle and the conservation of p - parity and total angular momentum induces an cancellation of re due to the reactions @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we establish the spin structure of the threshold amplitudes for @xmath1 and analyze the most simple polarization phenomena for this process .",
    "the importance of pauli principle for re , due to the processes @xmath33 , is demonstrated in section iii .",
    "the properties of the dispersive part of re are described in section iv .",
    "the description of the process @xmath34 in the framework of impulse approximation is presented in section v. in section vi we consider the general kinematics of the threshold inelastic @xmath35-meson photoproduction , @xmath36 for charged and neutral pions .",
    "finally , in section vii we consider the scalar deuteron photoproduction , @xmath37 , ( i.e. the @xmath38-system is in a singlet state ) where re must be important .",
    "let us consider , firstly , the simplest process of pion photoproduction on the deuteron , @xmath1 , in the threshold region , where the main contributions are due to @xmath0 production in s- and p - states . for s - state production ( i.e. with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the total angular momentum of the produced @xmath29-system and @xmath42 is its @xmath42-parity ) the conservation of @xmath42-parity and total angular momentum allows two multipole transitions , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with the following parametrization of the spin structure of corresponding matrix element : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the photon polarization vector , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the axial vectors of deuteron polarization ( in initial and final states ) , @xmath49 is the unit vector along the three - momentum of photon in the center of mass ( cms ) of the considered reaction , @xmath23 and @xmath50 are the multipole amplitudes , describing the @xmath51 and @xmath52photon absorption with the s - state @xmath0-production . in the general case",
    "these amplitudes are complex functions of the photon energy , @xmath53 , but due to the t - invariance of hadron electrodynamics @xcite , the relative phase of multipole amplitudes must be equal to @xmath54 or @xmath35 .    the differential cross section for the process @xmath1 is expressed in terms of the multipole amplitudes @xmath23 and @xmath50 , in a particular normalization , as : @xmath55 ( in @xmath56 ) does not vanish : @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the tensor polarization of deuteron target .",
    "the corresponding density matrix can be written as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the vector deuteron polarization .",
    "averaging over the photon polarizations and summing over the final deuteron polarizations , one finds : @xmath61 where we defined the ratio @xmath62 .",
    "the sign @xmath63 corresponds to the two possible relative signs of the amplitudes @xmath23 and @xmath50 .",
    "the behavior of the asymmetry @xmath64 as a function of @xmath65 is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "one can see the large sensitivity of @xmath64 to the relative sign and to the ratio of the @xmath23 and @xmath50 amplitudes , even at small @xmath65 .",
    "the complete experiment , i.e. the full determination of the amplitudes @xmath23 and @xmath50 , is realized , at threshold , through the measurement of two observables only , the differential cross section and the tensor analyzing power : @xmath66 the interference contribution , which is sensitive to the small magnetic amplitude @xmath50 , can be determined through the following formula : @xmath67 note that all the polarization phenomena for the process @xmath39 near threshold can be predicted in terms of the tensor analyzing power and of the differential cross section . to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us consider , as an example , the collision of polarized photons with a polarized deuteron target . in case of a linearly polarized photon beam",
    ", we can define the following asymmetry : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the components of the photon polarization vector in a coordinate system with the @xmath71axis along the 3-vector @xmath49 .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath72 can be written as a function of the multipole amplitudes @xmath23 and @xmath50 , and of the tensor polarizations as : @xmath73 so that : @xmath74 in ia , for @xmath1 , ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the amplitude @xmath23 , which is generated by the s - wave component of the deuteron wave function ( at relatively small internal momentum ) , is proportional to the sum of @xmath9 amplitudes for @xmath8 and @xmath75-processes : @xmath76 , \\label{eq : geia}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the s - wave deuteron form factor at @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the photon threshold energy ( in cms ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath50 of magnetic quadrupole absorption has not an analogue for the elementary processes @xmath80 , at threshold . in the framework of ia",
    ", it can not be derived from the spin structure @xmath81 for the threshold amplitude of the elementary process @xmath80 .",
    "therefore the amplitude @xmath50 is very sensitive to the details of the reaction mechanism , in @xmath1 .",
    "the realization of the complete experiment , as indicated above , would be very interesting , in this respect .",
    "the impulse approximation is only one of the ingredients in the analysis of the process @xmath82 .",
    "let s discuss now re .",
    "it is well known ( @xcite and refs . herein ) that the @xmath9 amplitude for the charged pion production on nucleons is larger ( in absolute value ) than the corresponding amplitude for neutral pion production : @xmath83 .",
    "this fact is generally accepted as the underlying reason for the manifestation of re due to reactions ( 1 ) . in this case , a model independent information about the elementary amplitude of @xmath0-production on neutron , @xmath75 can not be derived from the study of the reaction @xmath1 .",
    "previous calculations @xcite have shown that re , which involve intermediate charged pions , essentially change the predictions of the impulse approximation .",
    "we show here that re due to reactions ( 1 ) , cancel out for the threshold amplitudes , if one takes into account the spin structure of the corresponding transitions which are allowed by the pauli principle and the conservation of angular momentum and p - parity . as a result",
    ", we will prove that the state with @xmath40 is forbidden for the intermediate @xmath84(and @xmath85)- system , if @xmath86 ( threshold conditions ) , where @xmath87 is the orbital angular momentum for the @xmath88system , and @xmath89 is the pion orbital momentum relative to the pp - system ( fig .",
    "therefore reactions ( 1 ) can not occur in threshold regime .    for the @xmath88 system with @xmath90 , only the singlet state is allowed .",
    "therefore , at threshold of @xmath34 , @xmath91 takes the value @xmath92 ( instead of @xmath40 for the threshold @xmath93-system ) .",
    "this is illustrated also in the corresponding feynman diagrams ( fig .",
    "4 ) , where at threshold , we have for the three - momentum of the protons : @xmath94 , with evident cancellation of the two contributions .",
    "this result is valid for any parametrization of the deuteron wave function and relative value of the amplitudes for the different pion production processes .",
    "it is also correct for coherent @xmath0 electro - production on deuteron , @xmath95 , at any value of momentum transfer square @xmath12 , in the space - like region and for any polarization ( transversal and longitudinal ) of virtual photons .",
    "the main assumption , done here , is that both nucleons in the intermediate state are on mass shell , so that the @xmath96-system , with @xmath90 has positive p - parity .",
    "off - shell protons would have an antinucleon component with negative p - parity . in principle , these intermediate configurations can contribute , but they have been neglected in all previously quoted calculations of re , which were done in framework of non - relativistic approach .    the cancellation of re ( for the imaginary part of the threshold amplitudes ) in the @xmath31 state , for @xmath1 at threshold is a rigorous general result , which has to be verified by any model calculation .",
    "but , technically , this can be a difficult problem . to show this ,",
    "let us consider the standard procedure of re calculation , with a single @xmath97-scattering . to satisfy the pauli principle , ( for the intermediate @xmath98-state , with two identical nucleons )",
    ", it is necessary to add to the usual diagram ( where a pion , photoproduced on one nucleon , is scattered by another one , fig .",
    "5a ) , the diagram ( 5b ) , where the pion is scattered by the same nucleon .",
    "only the sum of ( a)+(b ) contributions , calculated with the same vertexes , satisfies the pauli principle , resulting in a compensation of re .",
    "but the ( 5b ) contribution , is a particular part of the amplitude for @xmath1 , calculated in ia ( fig .",
    "so , to avoid a double counting , in model calculations it is necessary to subtract from the full ia @xmath99 amplitude , the important part due to pion rescattering on the same nucleon : @xmath100 .",
    "this means that the ia amplitude for @xmath1 must be calculated with a _",
    "amplitude for @xmath101 , ( fig .",
    "7 ) , not with the standard one .",
    "this renormalization procedure is nontrivial and looks like a numerical artifact , but the calculations of re , due to ( 5a ) only , violate the pauli principle and result in large re for @xmath1 .    therefore , the most delicate problem in calculating the contributions ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) , is to satisfy the pauli principle and to avoid double counting , which can induce large , non - physical re .",
    "let us reanalyze , at the light of the previous discussion , the available experimental data .",
    "the value of the threshold amplitude , extracted from deuteron photoproduction data @xcite , is @xmath102 .",
    "more exactly , the experimental observable is the cross section , which is proportional to the amplitude squared .",
    "the minus sign has been attributed in order to be consistent with the chpt predictions @xcite . in the framework of ia , [ eq : geia ] , if we assume that re are absent , it is straightforward to extract the neutron amplitude . in table",
    "i we report the values of the neutron amplitude for the two possible signs of the deuteron amplitude .",
    "we remark that the result obtained for @xmath103 , using a positive value for @xmath104 and the experimental value of @xmath105 @xcite , is not far from the chpt prediction .",
    "the cancellation of re s at the threshold of the process @xmath1 , can explain naturally and in a model independent way , the absence of unitary cusp in the energy dependence of the @xmath9-amplitude for this process recently experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "this cusp is present on @xmath0-photoproduction on the nucleon , due to the @xmath106 rescattering and they have been observed on a proton target @xcite , but the pauli principle forbids the corresponding intermediate states in ( 1 ) ( in case of a deuteron target ) .",
    "therefore the absence of cusp can be considered as an experimental evidence of the cancellation of re in threshold @xmath0 photoproduction on deuteron .",
    "note also that the experimental data about coherent @xmath0 electro - production on the deuteron at @xmath12=0.1 gev@xmath28 , do not show either any evidence of the corresponding cusp at 2.2 mev above the @xmath0-threshold @xcite .",
    "this cusp should be present if re , due to ( 1 ) were important .    summarizing the previous discussion ,",
    "the most crucial points in the evaluation of re , especially in numerical calculations , in the near threshold region for @xmath1 are the following :    * cancellation of s - wave contributions ( independently for @xmath107 and @xmath108 intermediate states ) , which must be done analytically , in exact form ; * estimation of the relative role of other possible _ non s - wave _ contributions to the re .",
    "the above mentioned result does not mean that all rescattering effects cancel in the near threshold region for the process @xmath82 .",
    "more precisely it is correct for the imaginary part of the two threshold amplitudes , @xmath23 and @xmath50 , for @xmath82 , with @xmath109 intermediate states , where all these three particles , being in relative s - states , are on mass and energy shell .",
    "these imaginary parts vanish , due to the pauli principle and p - parity conservation .",
    "such cancellations explain naturally the absence of cusp in the energy dependence of the threshold amplitudes for @xmath1 in the corresponding experimental data , whereas this cusp is present in the energy dependence of the @xmath110 amplitude , due to the unitarity chain : @xmath111 .",
    "but what about the real ( dispersive ) part of the amplitudes @xmath23 and @xmath50 , corresponding to @xmath40 ?",
    "these quantities are determined by definite dispersion integrals , from the corresponding imaginary parts - over the photon energy ( and over the internal momenta of the @xmath112-system ) from threshold to infinity .",
    "however , far from threshold , @xmath113 contains different contributions , with higher values of the orbital momenta @xmath87 and @xmath89 .",
    "the p - parity conservation and the pauli principle have to be taken into account for the analysis of these contributions .",
    "for example , the values @xmath87 and @xmath89 must be even for the singlet @xmath114system , therefore the lowest @xmath109-intermediate state is characterized by @xmath115 .",
    "the next states have @xmath116 , etc .",
    "such contributions to @xmath113 can not be generated by the threshold @xmath117-operator for the elementary process @xmath80 and start to appear far from the threshold of the process @xmath1 .",
    "the selection rules ( due to p - parity conservation and pauli principle ) allow intermediate @xmath109-states where the nucleons are in a triplet state with odd values of @xmath87 and @xmath89 .",
    "the first of these contributions to @xmath113has the following quantum numbers : @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and thereafter @xmath120 , @xmath119 , etc .",
    "so for all these intermediate states with nonzero values of @xmath87 and @xmath89 , the @xmath97-elastic scattering , ( which is the next step in the rescattering chain , see , for example , fig .",
    "9 ) , can not occur in the @xmath121-state , as it was often assumed in the estimations of re .",
    "again we must stress that these states have a non - threshold nature , because they can not be generated by the threshold operator @xmath117 . in the previous theoretical considerations",
    "@xcite namely this operator was responsible for the large re in the @xmath1-process near threshold . the argument to justify such approximation was based on the inequality @xmath122 . but as we showed above , large re near threshold can be induced by the electric dipole contribution only by contradicting the pauli principle .",
    "we showed that re in the threshold region are canceled in the imaginary parts of @xmath23 and @xmath50 .",
    "we did not calculate the dispersive part of re , where , evidently , it will be necessary to consider not only @xmath109 -states , but @xmath123 states - with neutral pions- as well .    in a similar way",
    ", re can be analyzed not only for the s - wave production in @xmath1 , but for p - wave production also , and for higher waves as well .",
    "the p - parity conservation and the pauli principle will be equally important for the analysis of possible re contributions to the corresponding imaginary parts of multipole amplitudes , showing the cancellation of many contributions . therefore , probably such way -through the calculation of multipole amplitudes in two steps - finding the imaginary part , firstly , and then calculating the dispersive part , will be the most effective way to perform a correct evaluation of re .",
    "an threshold , i.e. when @xmath86 , for the process @xmath124 we showed that re cancel out .",
    "other values of @xmath87 and @xmath89 are , in principle , possible , but their contribution can not be large , in the threshold region , due to centrifugal considerations .",
    "let us consider @xmath118 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , which is the next allowed possibility to obtain @xmath40 , the threshold value . in order to generate such states , it is necessary to have a particular mechanism of re . in the framework of the existing analysis of re , based on the standard structure of the @xmath125 near - threshold amplitude , @xmath126 , it is possible to show that two p - waves for the @xmath127- intermediate state are not allowed .",
    "the matrix element for @xmath128 in the case of @xmath40 , with @xmath118 is proportional to the product of two small three - momenta : @xmath129 ( proton ) and @xmath130 ( pion ) .",
    "let us parametrize these contributions in a model independent way .",
    "the conservation of the total angular momentum and the p - parity allows the following multipole transitions for @xmath131 : @xmath43 and @xmath132 and @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the total angular momentum of the produced @xmath88system .",
    "having @xmath135 , such system has to be in triplet state , so @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , in threshold region , where @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , this mechanism can induce the following transitions for the @xmath107 system : @xmath154 with @xmath86 and @xmath155 with @xmath86 ( both protons are in a singlet state ) . but @xmath154 is not a possible configuration for the reaction @xmath156 at threshold ( as it was proved above ) , and @xmath155 corresponds to the d - wave of @xmath0 , with evidently small amplitudes . the @xmath157- final interaction ( fig .",
    "8a ) can not transform a singlet @xmath96-system to a triplet one , and @xmath97 rescattering ( fig .",
    "8b ) can not re - arrange the threshold spin structure of the matrix element for @xmath158 in the framework of the considered mechanism .",
    "the possible triplet contributions to the matrix element ( [ eq : first ] ) , may appear only far from threshold , where @xmath159 and @xmath160 : in this case the states with @xmath135 and @xmath161 are possible , but then the p - parity of this channel is positive , because @xmath162 , and , again , it is incompatible with @xmath40 ( which characterizes the threshold conditions for @xmath156 ) .    for a more general analysis ,",
    "it is possible to take into account the full spin structure of the elementary process @xmath163 in the following form : @xmath164 one can see that in threshold conditions for the @xmath88system , at this vertex all configurations for any value of @xmath89 are allowed , but there is a restriction on @xmath87 : only singlet @xmath88states with @xmath90 or @xmath165 are permitted . and",
    "only one configuration with a combination of @xmath166 and @xmath165 can produce @xmath40 .",
    "however this is a small contribution , which results from the multiplication of at least 3 small factors : @xmath167 @xmath168@xmath169 .    note that p - wave in @xmath170 combined with the effect due to @xmath171 ( or @xmath172 ) can result in @xmath40 .",
    "but we showed that this effect is small and , moreover , it is not related to the fact that @xmath173  @xmath174 , which is commonly taken as an evidence of large re .",
    "the standard mechanism of pion rescattering in the reactions @xmath175 , can not produce large multipole amplitudes with @xmath40 .",
    "a similar analysis of re holds also for threshold @xmath0 electro - production , @xmath95 .",
    "let us mention in this respect , that the threshold matrix element for @xmath176 contains the contributions of the 3 following multipole transitions : @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 , where the indexes @xmath180 and @xmath181 correspond to the absorption of a virtual photon with transversal and longitudinal polarization .",
    "therefore the matrix element for the process @xmath176 , corresponding to s - state @xmath0-production has the following expression @xcite : @xmath182 where @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath50 are the corresponding form factors , depending , in general , on two kinematical variables , @xmath185 and @xmath186 . in any case",
    "they can be considered as the inelastic threshold electromagnetic form factors for the s - state @xmath0-production in the process @xmath176 .",
    "this parametrization of the matrix element ( which is equivalent to the corresponding description of the elastic @xmath187 scattering , in terms of three well - known form factors ) is suitable for the description of polarization phenomena for @xmath2 , near threshold .",
    "consequently , a rosenbluth fit for @xmath2 ( with unpolarized particles ) allows us to find two quadratic combinations of form factors , namely @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "in order to separate the @xmath183 and @xmath50 contributions , the measurement of the tensor analyzing power ( or the final deuteron tensor polarization ) is necessary , as in the case of elastic @xmath190-scattering .",
    "in case of neutral pion production in the intermediate state , @xmath192 , re can contribute to threshold @xmath0 production , @xmath1 through the triplet @xmath193intermediate state , due to the non identity of @xmath194 and @xmath195 , but these effects are small .",
    "this follows from the fact that the spin structure of the threshold amplitudes for the processes @xmath34 and @xmath196 are different .    in this connection",
    "we can mention that the thresholds for @xmath197 and @xmath198 processes are higher in comparison with @xmath199 : @xmath200 @xmath201",
    "@xmath202    : the spin structure of this amplitude is mainly driven by the pauli principle . at threshold the single allowed multipole transition @xmath203 is described by the following matrix element : @xmath204 the amplitude @xmath205 describes the absorption of electric dipole photons and @xmath206 and @xmath207 are the 2-component spinors of the final nucleons .",
    ": at threshold we have three independent multipole transitions : @xmath203 ( singlet @xmath193production as in the case of @xmath34 ) , and the following two multipole transitions : @xmath43 and @xmath208 @xmath209 , - with triplet @xmath193production - described by the matrix element : @xmath210 \\sigma_y\\tilde{\\chi_1}^{\\dagger},\\ ] ] where @xmath211 and @xmath212 are the corresponding multipole amplitudes . from the generalized pauli principle , we can conclude that these amplitudes are isovector .",
    "all polarization phenomena in @xmath34 can be exactly predicted , in a model independent way due to the presence of a single threshold amplitude .",
    "for example , the dependence of the cross section from the deuteron tensor polarization can be written as : @xmath213,\\ ] ] where @xmath214 is the element of the space volume for the 3-particle final state .",

    "the situation with re in the semi - coherent process @xmath219 , with production of a scalar deuteron , @xmath220 , is very different , in comparison with the reaction @xmath1 . for the process @xmath221 , at threshold",
    ", @xmath91 takes the value @xmath92 and the conservation of the total angular momentum and p - parity allows the following intermediate processes ( where the intermediate @xmath84 @xmath222 have also @xmath154 ) : @xmath223 both rescattering contributions ( fig .",
    "9 ) have the same sign : this induces a coherent increasing , instead of a cancellation ( as in the case @xmath224 ) .",
    "another interesting property of the considered process is connected with the isotopic structure of the corresponding amplitude .",
    "the production of @xmath220 , with unit value of isotopic spin in the reaction @xmath218 , is determined by the absorption of isoscalar photon ( instead of isovector , for the process @xmath225 ) . in ia , ( fig .",
    "10 ) , the corresponding amplitudes is proportional to the difference of the elementary amplitudes , i.e. : @xmath226 as the elementary amplitudes , have different signs , one can deduce that cross section for the process @xmath218 is much larger in comparison with @xmath225",
    ". therefore the ratio of these cross sections has to be very sensitive to the model chosen to determine @xmath174 .",
    "for example , in the framework of chpt , with @xmath227 and @xmath228 ( in units @xmath229 ) , one can find : @xmath230 and @xmath231 , this ratio is much larger : latexmath:[\\[\\displaystyle\\frac{|f(\\gamma d\\to d_s\\pi^0)|^2 } { |f(\\gamma d\\to d\\pi^0)|^2}=\\left      production , in the near threshold region , can be very large for the process @xmath218 and should be determined experimentally , too .",
    "a similar situation occurs for @xmath233 photoproduction on the deuteron .",
    "the first experimental study of this process was done more than 25 years ago @xcite , but only recently it has been shown @xcite that the cross section of the coherent process @xmath234 is smaller than the incoherent @xmath233-photoproduction through @xmath235 .",
    "we have shown that re for the processes @xmath1 and @xmath95 , due to the intermediate processes @xmath236 is negligible in the near threshold region ( when the @xmath0 is produced in s- and p - states ) - for the imaginary part of the corresponding threshold amplitudes .",
    "this result is obtained in a very general form , using only the symmetry properties of strong and electromagnetic interactions : the pauli principle and conservation of p - parity and total angular momentum .",
    "it is a model independent result , and therefore it has to be verified by any model calculation . in particular , for numerical calculations",
    ", this would constitute a very important check that all contributions are properly treated and in particular double counting is avoided .",
    "the cancellation of re can explain the absence of unitary cusp for the process @xmath1 , at the threshold of processes @xmath34 and @xmath198 .",
    "our result about re changes the previous interpretation of the experiment @xcite , concerning the evaluation of the @xmath237-amplitude .",
    "the precise value of this amplitude is especially important in order to test the isotopic structure of @xmath163 and the predictions of chpt @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the data about @xmath95 at large momentum transfer @xcite , will have also to take into account this result .",
    "we have also shown that the same general arguments predict large re , for another possible coherent process , the photoproduction of scalar deuteron , @xmath218 , with isotopic spin @xmath238 . in this case",
    "the corresponding ia amplitude is proportional to the difference of the @xmath239 and @xmath240 amplitudes .",
    "we are pleased to thank j. m. laget for many interesting discussions .",
    "one of us ( m.p.r . ) acknowledges the financial support of cea ( saclay ) and the warm hospitality of dapnia / sphn , where this work was done .",
