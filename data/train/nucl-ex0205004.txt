    "in past attempts to investigate the relationship between nuclear multifragmentation and a liquid to vapor phase transition @xcite various studies have sought to determine one or more critical exponents @xcite , other studies have examined caloric curves @xcite , and still others have reported the observation of negative heat capacities @xcite .",
    "these studies suffer from the lack of knowledge of the system s location in pressure - density - temperature @xmath3 space .",
    "for example , interpretations of caloric curves and negative heat capacities depend on assumptions of either constant pressure or constant density @xcite .  in the case of determining critical exponents",
    ", it was assumed that the fragmenting system is at coexistence and the dominant factor in fragment production was the surface energy .",
    "the analysis presented below makes no assumptions about the location of the system in @xmath4 space and allows for other energetic considerations with regards to fragment production",
    ".    in this paper the analysis technique recently used on multifragmentation data collected by the isis collaboration @xcite is applied to the data sets for the multifragmentation of gold , lanthanum and krypton nuclei collected by the eos collaboration .",
    "all three eos experimental data sets are shown to contain the signature of a liquid to vapor phase transition manifested by the scaling behavior predicted by fisher s droplet formalism , and the liquid - vapor coexistence line is determined over a large temperature interval extending up to and including the critical point .",
    "the critical exponents @xmath1 and @xmath0 , as well as the critical temperature @xmath5 , the surface energy coefficient @xmath2 and the compressibility factor @xmath6 are directly extracted .  from the behavior of the fragment yields the @xmath7-@xmath8 and",
    "@xmath8-@xmath9 coexistence curves are determined and the critical pressure @xmath10 and critical density @xmath11 are estimated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ eos - experiment ] reviews the eos data sets ; section [ fishers - droplet - formalism ] reviews fisher s droplet formalism and its connection to nuclear evaporation ; section [ fitting - the - data ] discusses the details of the data analysis ; section [ results ] reports the results of the data analysis ; section [ phase - diagram ] shows the physical implications of these results ; and finally , in section [ conclusion ] a brief discussion of the results is made .  in order to demonstrate the efficacy of the analysis performed on the eos data sets ,",
    "an appendix shows the results of this analysis performed on percolation cluster distributions .",
    "the eos collaboration has collected data for the reverse kinematics reactions @xmath12 agev au@xmath13c , @xmath12 agev la@xmath13c and @xmath12 agev kr@xmath13c @xcite .",
    "there were @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 fully reconstructed events recorded for the au@xmath13c , la@xmath13c and kr@xmath13c reactions , respectively .",
    "the term `` fully reconstructed '' means that the total measured charge in each event was within three units of the charge of the projectile .    for every event ,",
    "the charge and mass of the projectile remnant ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) were determined by subtracting the charge and mass of the particles knocked out of the projectile from the charge and mass of the projectile @xcite .",
    "the thermal component of the excitation energy per nucleon of the remnant @xmath19 was determined as follows .  first , the total excitation energy per nucleon @xmath20 was reconstructed based on an energy balance between the initial stage of the excited remnant and the final stage of the noninteracting fragments .",

    ".  for further details see reference @xcite .",
    "the thermal component of the excitation energy per nucleon of the remnant @xmath19 was then determined by subtracting the expansion energy @xmath26 from @xmath20 , where the quantity @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 the total kinetic energy ; @xmath29 the sum of the translational thermal contribution to the fragment spectra ; and @xmath30 the coulomb contribution .",
    "the translational energy is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the multiplicity of fragments and @xmath33 is the temperature calculated from the isotopic yields @xcite .",

    "were @xmath39 the volume of the remnant at normal density and @xmath40 the volume of the excited remnant that isentropically expands from the normal volume of the projectile @xmath41 @xcite ; @xmath35 is then determined from @xmath42 assuming a spherical volume .",
    "this form of @xmath30 follows reference @xcite and takes into account the changing volume of the excited remnant as a function of excitation energy .",
    "previous estimates of @xmath30 did not account for the changing volume of the fragmenting remnant @xcite .",
    "this difference leads to a few amev difference in @xmath19 in the most violent collisions .    for the analysis in this paper ,",
    "the data for each system was binned in terms of @xmath19 in units of @xmath43 amev ; i.e. @xmath44 bins covered the excitation energy range @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ systematics ] shows some of the systematics of the eos data binned in this manner .",
    "these results are consistent with other eos publications @xcite .",
    "the systematics of the eos data sets shown in fig .",
    "[ systematics ] demonstrates the similarity in behavior exhibited by the data sets when their differing sizes are taken into account by normalizing the quantity in question to the projectile charge @xmath46 or the charge of the fragmenting system @xmath47 .",

    "[ systematics]d where only below @xmath48 amev do all three systems behave similarly .  above @xmath48 amev , the size of the fragmenting systems",
    "dominate .",
    "this is reflected in the ordering of @xmath49 ; from lowest to highest : krypton , lanthanum and gold .",
    "as with several other analyses @xcite , the basis of the present effort lies in an examination of the fragment yield distribution in the context of fisher s droplet formalism @xcite .",
    "thus , a brief review of fisher s formalism is given in the following section , together with a justification for its applicability to nuclear decay rates .",
    "fisher s droplet formalism and its forerunners @xcite are based on an equilibrium description of physical clusters or droplets that condense in a low density vapor .  while fisher s formalism has long been applied to nuclear multifragmentation yields",
    "@xcite , the question arises as to the validity of a picture of clusters in equilibrium within a low density vapor to experiments in which excited nuclei undergo multifragmentation in vacuum .  specifically : `` in which sense is there an equilibrium between liquid and vapor in the free ( vacuum ) decay of a ( multifragmenting ) hot intermediate ( nucleus ) ? ''  or more to the point : `` where is the vapor ? ''    if one assumes , as in a compound nucleus reaction , that the initial collision entity relaxes _ quickly _ to a hot thermalized blob , which proceeds _",
    "slowly _ to emit particles stochastically , the answers to this question is simple .",
    "the hot blob is the liquid which is evaporating in free space according to standard evaporation theories .  to establish coexistence",
    ", the vapor need not be present .",
    "all that is necessary is to appreciate that :      in fact the concentration of species @xmath50 is completely defined by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the emission flux of @xmath50 , @xmath53 is the concentration of species @xmath50 and @xmath54 is the average velocity of @xmath50 which is of order of @xmath55 .  in other words , the outward flux , at equilibrium , is the same as the inward flux .      1 .   at equilibrium ,",
    "the evaporated particle is replaced by the back flux from the vapor .   however , since the back flux is absent in the case of nuclear multifragmentation , this analysis is limited to particles with low emission probability ( first chance ) and must avoid particles which are emitted with high multiplicity .",
    "this is approximately achieved by eliminating fragments with @xmath56 from the ensuing analysis .",
    "2 .   in the same spirit as above",
    ", the pertinent temperature is that of the blob as it evaporates low probability particles .",
    "thus , rather than worrying about the role of high multiplicity particles and their associated cooling on the energy - temperature relationship , the fermi gas relation ship @xmath57 can be assumed with good confidence .",
    "the basic idea is that in a non - ideal vapor of particles interacting with repulsive cores and short range attractive forces , can be approximated at low densities and temperature by an ideal gas consisting of noninteracting monomers , dimers , trimers at equilibrium .",
    "the ( free ) energy of sufficiently large clusters can be estimated in terms of their volume and surface energy .",
    "these clusters are in equilibrium with each other and the relative abundances of differently sized clusters changes with temperature and pressure @xcite .",
    "the relative abundances of clusters with @xmath50 constituents is given by : @xmath58 .",
    "\\label{droplet_distribution}\\ ] ] here @xmath59 is a constant of proportionality which is fixed by the critical density @xcite .",
    "the power law @xmath60 arises from a combinatorial factor that depends on the fact that the surface of the cluster must be closed @xcite .",
    "the distance from coexistence is : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the chemical potential the liquid at coexistence and @xmath63 is the chemical potential of the system .",
    "for @xmath64 ( a super - heated vapor ) and @xmath65 ( liquid - vapor coexistence ) the above sum always converges .  while for @xmath66 ( a super - saturated vapor ) , the sum diverges .",
    "the `` classical '' part of the surface energy is parameterized by @xmath67 , where @xmath2 is the zero temperature surface energy coefficient , @xmath68 and @xmath69 relates the number of constituents of a cluster to the most probable surface area .",
    "fisher s critical exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 depend on the euclidean dimensionality and universality class of the system .",
    "the total pressure of the entire cluster distribution is given by summing all of the partial pressures @xmath70 : @xmath71 and the density is @xmath72 thus the pressure and density of the system can be inferred from the knowledge of the cluster distributions .    at the critical point",
    "the system is at coexistence ( @xmath65 ) and the classical part of the surface energy cost vanishes ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "thus both exponential factors are unity leaving only the temperature independent power law : @xmath74 away from the critical point , but along the coexistence curve so that @xmath65 , the cluster distribution is given by : @xmath75 equation  ( [ droplet_distribution_at_mucoex ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath76 thus the cluster distribution along the coexistence curve is given by a boltzmann factor with @xmath77 and @xmath78 this boltzmann factor manifests itself in arrhenius plots for the fragment yields where a linear relation between @xmath79 and and @xmath80 is observed .",
    "this behavior has long been observed in many nuclear fragment yield distributions @xcite and has recently been observed in the cluster distributions of percolation ( with the bond breaking probability playing the role of temperature ) @xcite and the ising model @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , fisher s formalism relates directly to a reaction rate picture .  in this picture , the heavy fragments ( e.g. @xmath81 ) are the product of first chance emission from the excited remnant .",
    "the first chance emission from a compound nucleus can be written as : @xmath82 thus the fragment yields , parameterized via fisher , can be related to the decay rates ( widths @xmath83 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath83 , which controls the first chance emission yields , is the same decay width which controls the mean emission times @xmath84 since : @xmath85 thus @xmath86 the mean time for fragment emission reported by the isis collaboration @xcite is well described as a boltzmann factor .",
    "it was also noted that the boltzmann factor describing the emission times is the same as that describing the fragment yields @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the thermal reaction rate picture is valid for multifragmentation ; fragments can be viewed as being the result of the evaporation of an excited nucleus .",
    "preliminary fits of the gold , lanthanum and krypton data with eq .",
    "( [ droplet_distribution ] ) led to puzzlingly large results for @xmath87 ( @xmath88 amev ) which could be interpreted as a substantial degree of super - saturation .",
    "a much more plausible alternative explanation is the lack of account of the coulomb effects in fisher s formalism .",
    "equations  ( [ boltzmann_distribution ] ) and ( [ barrier ] ) support the presence of a barrier controlling the flux from liquid to vapor and vice versa .",
    "this barrier should depend not only on the surface energy of the fragment but should reflect the entire energy necessary to remove a fragment from the liquid and place it into the vapor .  at the least",
    ", the energy necessary to relocate a charge @xmath37 from the bulk to `` near '' the surface of the `` residual '' nucleus should be evaluated .",
    "this energy is negative and counteracts the effects of the surface energy .",
    "furthermore , it is to leading order , linear in @xmath37 and thus in @xmath50 .",
    "thus the large values of @xmath89 .",
    "an attempt to include the coulomb energy explicitly is then @xmath90 with @xmath91 with @xmath92 fm .  in eq .",
    "( [ coulomb ] ) there is a recognizable coulomb interaction energy of two touching spheres modified by a factor @xmath93 .",
    "the parameter @xmath94 ( left as a fit parameter ) takes into account the numerical coefficients of the linear term in @xmath37 plus polarization effects , and @xmath95 takes care of the need for the vanishing difference between the liquid and vapor near the critical point .",
    "note that the coulomb energy discussed in eq .",
    "( [ coulomb - component ] ) is different from the coulomb energy discussed in eq .",
    "( [ coulomb ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ coulomb - component ] ) describes the total coulomb energy present in the fragmentation process , while eq .",
    "( [ coulomb ] ) describes the cost in moving a fragment from the nuclear liquid to the nuclear vapor .",
    "the mass of a fragment @xmath50 prior to secondary decay was estimated by multiplying the measured fragment charge @xmath37 by @xmath96 and then by a factor of @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the binding energy of the fragment and @xmath99 is a fit parameter to allow for an increase or decrease in the amount of secondary decay .",
    "the temperature was determined by assuming a degenerate fermi gas , @xmath100 the parameter @xmath101 was taken to be @xcite : @xmath102 in order to accommodate the empirically observed change in @xmath101 with excitation energy @xcite .",
    "here @xmath103 is the binding energy of the fragmenting system .  using the fermi gas approximation to relate @xmath19 and @xmath8 gives a reasonable estimate of the temperature of the excited remnant at the time of first chance emission .",
    "it has been observed that even the isotope ratio thermometer follows the fermi gas approximation quite well so long as the average number of imfs is less than one @xcite .    to obtain the concentration of fragments of a given mass ,",
    "the total number of fragments @xmath104 of a given size @xmath50 was normalized to the size of the fragmenting system @xmath105 so that @xmath106 .",
    "the location of the critical point , in terms of excitation energy , was determined from an examination of measured fluctuations .  in general , as the critical point of a system",
    "is approached from the two phase region , the difference between phases diminishes and the system fluctuates from one phase to the other .  at the critical point",
    "the fluctuations are maximal .",
    "however , while the maximum in the fluctuations occurs at the critical point , the presence of a peak in the fluctuations is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for a existence of a phase transition @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations measured in the eos data are : ( 1 ) in the charge of the largest fragment normalized to the charge of the fragmenting system , and ( 2 ) related to the average mass number of a fragment as measured by the quantity @xmath107 @xcite , where @xmath108 with @xmath109 as the @xmath110 moments of the fragment distributions @xmath111 these fluctuations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fluctuations1 ] .",
    "the peak in the fluctuations was found by smoothing the data ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fluctuations1 ] ) , taking the numerical derivative of the smoothed data and finding the value of @xmath19 where the the derivative passed through zero , see fig .  [ fluctuations2 ] .",
    "finally , the value of the excitation energy at the critical point @xmath112 was determined by averaging the results from both measures of the fluctuations .",
    "table  [ critical - point - table ] lists the results .  for this analysis",
    "the values determined for the excitation energy at the critical point for the au@xmath13c reaction are in proximity of other values observed in previous eos analyses ( @xmath113 amev ) @xcite .",
    "differences in the values of @xmath112 arise from the different method of constructing the thermal portion of the excitation energy described above @xcite .",
    "estimates of the critical temperature @xmath5 are made by using the values of @xmath112 in eq .",
    "( [ fermi - gas - temp ] ) and lead to values , shown in table  [ critical - point - table ] , that are comparable to theoretical estimates for small nuclear systems @xcite .  as an aside , as shown in table  [ critical - point - table ] the value of @xmath5 increases with decreasing projectile ( and thus remnant ) mass .",
    "this is opposite of the trend assumed in a prior analysis of the eos gold multifragmentation data where the coulomb energy was neglected @xcite but in agreement with the trend reported in other analysis of the eos data sets @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fluctuations1 ] the value of @xmath107 for the kr system attains a peak value of only @xmath114 .",
    "it has been suggested that the magnitude of the peak in @xmath107 could distinguish between the presence of a power law with @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) and an exponential distribution ( @xmath117 ) in the cluster yields @xcite .",
    "however , it was seen that this is not the case @xcite and it will be seen in the appendix that small percolation lattices have values of @xmath107 with peak magnitudes of less than two yet still exhibit a continuous phase transition with an exponent of @xmath118 in the power law describing the cluster yields at the critical point .",
    "thus , the height of the peak in @xmath107 can not be used to rule out the presence of a critical point and the associated power law in the cluster distribution or provide information about the value of the power law exponent .              to determine the `` energy of vaporization '' of a cluster @xmath119 the ideal gas approximation @xmath120",
    "is followed so that @xmath121 , where @xmath8 is replaced by @xmath122 in keeping with standard practice in percolation work and @xmath122 is the average bond breaking probability considered ; @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively .",
    "the @xmath129 values listed in table  [ perc - thermo - table ] were found by dividing @xmath130 by the most probable cluster size ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively ) , this puts @xmath119 on a `` per site '' basis .",
    "the values of @xmath129 shown in table  [ perc - thermo - table ] are nearly identical to the values of the surface energy coefficient @xmath2 , which is not surprising since for percolation on a simple cubic lattice @xmath2 arises from the bonds broken to form the surface .",
    "furthermore , the `` energy of vaporization '' is approximately equal to the number of bonds per lattice site ( also shown in table  [ perc - thermo - table ] ) , a strong indication that the @xmath134 calculated here is the `` bulk binding energy '' of the lattice in question .",
    "the value of @xmath129 decreases with the size of the lattice because the percolation calculations were performed for open boundary conditions .",
    "the compressibility factor at the critical point was determined via eq .",
    "( [ comp - fac - eq ] ) , the results are shown in table  [ perc - thermo - table ] .  from @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath11 ( determined below ) the `` pressure '' at the critical point can be found .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath10 are shown in table  [ perc - critical - point ] , but the interpretation of these values is an open question .    following the thermodynamic treatment of the percolation results , the reduced probability versus `` reduced density '' phase diagram is produced via eq .",
    "( [ reduced_density ] ) .",
    "this leads to the points shown in fig .",
    "[ perc - prob - dens ] .",
    "these points are then fit to guggenheim s empirical formula , eq .",
    "( [ gugg - eq ] ) , with @xmath137 ( in good agreement with text book values @xmath138",
    "@xcite ) from eq .  ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "these results are shown for each lattice by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ perc - prob - dens ] .    while it is not clear what density this plot describes , some insight can be gained by noting that the `` liquid '' branch reaches @xmath139 to @xmath140 at @xmath141 .  assuming that at @xmath141 @xmath142 , since no bonds are broken , then @xmath143 to @xmath144 , which is approximately the percentage of bonds broken at the critical point .",
    "thus it seems that the density in fig .",
    "[ perc - prob - dens ] is related to the number of broken bonds .",
    "it is also noted that for @xmath145 the vapor branch of the coexistence curve shows @xmath146 , this serves as an illustration of the magnitude of the error associated with this procedure .",
    "it is also possible to directly explore the behavior of the reduced density of the `` liquid , '' at least in the larger system .",
    "this is done by normalizing the size of the largest cluster at a given value of @xmath122 to the size of the largest cluster at the critical point @xmath147 .",
    "figure  [ perc - prob - dens ] shows that for the @xmath148 lattice , the measured normalized density of the liquid tracks along the coexistence curve predicted by guggenheim s empirical formula and the reduced density of the vapor .  for @xmath149 the effects of the finite size of the lattice",
    "are observed and the measured reduced density of the liquid deviates from the coexistence curve .",
    "the effects of finite size are more evident in the smaller lattices where there is little or no agreement between the measured reduced density of the liquid and the coexistence curves .",
    "effects of finite size on the largest cluster such as these have been observed previously @xcite ."
