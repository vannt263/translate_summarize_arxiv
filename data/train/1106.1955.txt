    "there are many magnetic flux tube emerging on the photosphere .",
    "the newly emerged magnetic flux tubes at the emerging site appear as the dark granular lanes @xcite on the photosphere . at the both ends of the dark granular lane , there are the magnetic concentrations which are called the footpoints and observed as the bright points in g band image @xcite . with h@xmath2 the emerged flux tubes are observed as dark arch filaments @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of an arch filament is 10 - 30 minutes @xcite .",
    "the rise velocity of arch filaments is 10 - 15 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the deceleration of the apex of the small - scale arch filaments in the chromosphere .",
    "emerging flux regions show a variety of size , lifetime , total magnetic flux and field strength .",
    "especially the small emerging flux regions are called ephemeral active region ( ear ; @xcite ) . for convenience , in the following page",
    "we define larger ( i.e. non - ear ) emerging flux regions as efrs .",
    "efrs are produced by fairly large - scale flux emergence .",
    "they have a pair or more complex group of sunspots with definite penumbrae .",
    "the typical size of efrs is more than 30 mm @xcite .",
    "efrs show their emergence activities for several days and exist on the solar surface for a few month at the maximum .",
    "the total flux in an efr increases with the rate of @xmath3 mx hr@xmath1 and reaches to the order of @xmath3-@xmath4 mx @xcite . in the fairly developed efr",
    "the field strength of main spot is around 3,000 gauss @xcite .",
    "ears have simple bipolar configuration .",
    "they have no penumbra in the sunspots .",
    "the typical size varies from 5 mm to 30 mm @xcite .",
    "ears have short life time of hours or one day .",
    "the total flux in an ear is up to @xmath3 mx with the increase rate of @xmath5 mx hr@xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic field strength of main spot is from a few times 100 gauss @xcite to 2,000 gauss @xcite .",
    "various simulation studies on flux emergence have been performed by many researchers @xcite .",

    "@xcite performed the mhd simulation of flux emergence in a sheet geometry .",
    "the initial stable flux sheet in the convective zone was perturbed with various wavelengths , which correspond to the convective motion .",
    "they found that irrespective of the wavelength of initial perturbation , a finite `` most unstable wavelength '' is excited .",
    "this wavelength ( 2 - 4 mm ) is inherent in the parker instability @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the flux sheet is undulated and the apexes of the convex field line ( -loops ) appear consecutively on the photosphere . some of dipped field lines ( -loops ) also emerge to form the regions called `` bald patches @xcite '' .",
    "on the other hand , observational study on a large efr and bald patches was performed by @xcite .",
    "they observed a fairly large ( @xmath6 mm ) efr with the magnetogram and found that the emerged field lines undulate vertically .",
    "they revealed that there are many bald patches between the main spots .",
    "these results confirmed that the emerging flux tube does not rise altogether at a time , but each -loop component rises individually .",
    "they proposed this model as `` resistive emergence model '' .",
    "the distance between two consecutive bald patches is in the range of 2 - 6 mm , which is consistent with a theoretical argument on the flattening of emerging magnetic field just below the surface and its critical emergence length , first presented by @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite further developed the simulation performed by @xcite and obtained the result in which the undulated field line caused reconnections with neighboring -loops and created larger loops .",
    "@xcite performed the three - dimensional mhd simulation of the emergence of undulating fieldlines .",
    "these reconnection events are interpreted as a sources of ellerman bombs @xcite .",
    "the resistive emergence model is applicable to the large efr .",
    "furthermore , recently @xcite found bald patches inside a small - scale ear ( @xmath7 mm ) using solar optical telescope ( sot ; @xcite ) aboard _ hinode _ @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite showed small ears ( 2 mm and 6 mm , respectively ) without undulated magnetic field .",
    "as stated above , the criteria of the bald patches formation are still uncertain .",
    "furthermore , in the latest simulation , the footpoints of emerged flux loops showed converging motion toward the bald patches on the photosphere @xcite .",
    "although this converging motion was observed in preceding studies @xcite , statistical analysis on that phenomenon with respect to the size and magnetic characteristics of the flux emergences has not been done yet .    to clarify the criteria of forming bald patch and converging flow",

    "the flux emergence phenomena from small ears to large efrs observed by sot were investigated on their morphological and magnetical characteristics .",
    "furthermore , we derived the the relations between the total magnetic flux and the maximum spatial size , the flux growth rate and the mean separation speed of the emergence event to clarify how the total flux amount controls the entire evolution of the emergence .",

    "we compensated the differential rotation of two consecutive mdi data observed before and after the sot observation and interpolated them by time to estimate the distribution of magnetic field at the time of sot observation .",
    "next we deteriorated sot polarimetric data with the spatial resolution of mdi magnetogram ( @xmath11 ) . using the deteriorated sot polarimetric data and mdi magnetogram , we made a scatter plot of sot polarimetric signal ( stokes @xmath12 ) to mdi field strength ( figure [ fig:02 ] ) .",

    "we performed linear fitting on the scatter plot and obtained the conversion equation from sot @xmath12 to the photospheric field strength @xmath13 , expressed as @xmath14 in the case of figure [ fig:02 ] , the offset value @xmath15 and the scaling factor @xmath16 were 4.029 gauss and 12528 gauss , respectively .",
    "note that the scatter of data points in the figure is mainly due to the doppler effect arising from the satellite s orbital motion . with this method we converted the sot polarimetric signals to the magnetic flux densities for all the samples .",

    "then we applied the subsonic filter of 3 minutes to the sot ca h image sequence in order to suppress chromospheric oscillatory motions ( figure [ fig:03]b ) .",

    "we have not considered the factors such as magnetic field stratification inside the flux tube , realistic aspect ratio of tube and so on .",
    "if we include these factors then we can get more realistic interpretation of equation ( [ eq:03 ] ) .",
    "we investigated the morphological , dynamical and magnetical characteristics of various flux emergence phenomena using high - resolution _ hinode _ sot data . to estimate the magnetic field density of sot data we used _",
    "mdi magnetogram data for the calibration . from 101 samples of flux emergence events , we derived the total flux , flux growth rate , maximum separation and mean separation speed .",
    "the sz features are associated with the magnetic flux emergence of more than around @xmath0 mx .",
    "the magnetic flux growth rate , emergence duration and mean separation speed were found to follow the power - law functions of the total magnetic flux with the indices of 0.57 , 0.43 and -0.16 , respectively .",
    "the typical size of elementary emergence structures is around 4 mm , which is consistent with the most unstable wavelength ( 2 - 4 mm ) of parker instability .",
    "the mean separating speed @xmath21 decreases with larger magnetic flux .",
    "we got a physical view of solar flux emergence that emerging magnetic fields float and evolve balancing to the surrounding turbulent atmosphere from the discussion on the observed power - law relations .",
    "these observational results should be verified by future numerical studies .",
    "possible influence of twisting or pre - existing magnetic field could be studied with the data of horizontal magnetic field in the emerging site and will be reported in the near future .",
