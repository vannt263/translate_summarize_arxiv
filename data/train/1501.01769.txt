    "the goal of this lecture is to explore traditional problems of analytic number theory in the context of function fields over a finite field .",
    "several such problems which are currently viewed as intractable over the integers , have recently been addressed in the function field context with vastly different tools than those of traditional analytic number theory , and the resulting theorems can be used to check existing conjectures over the integers , and to generate new ones .",
    "the problems that i will address concern    * counting primes in short intervals and in arithmetic progressions * chowla s conjecture on the autocorrelation of the mbius function * the twin prime conjecture * the additive divisor problem * the variance of sums of arithmetic functions in short intervals and arithmetic progressions .    before describing the problems",
    ", i will briefly survey some quantitative aspects of the arithmetic of the ring of polynomials over a finite field .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite field of @xmath2 elements , and @xmath0 $ ] the ring of polynomials with coefficients in @xmath1 .",
    "the polynomial ring @xmath0 $ ] shares several qualitative properties with the ring of integers @xmath3 , for instance having a euclidean algorithm , hence unique factorization into irreducibles .",
    "there are also several common quantitative aspects . to set these up , i review some basics",
    ".    the units of the ring of integers are @xmath4 , and every nonzero integer is a multiple by a unit of a positive integer .",
    "analogously , the units of @xmath0 $ ] are the nonzero scalars @xmath5 , and every nonzero polynomial is is a multiple by a unit of a monic polynomial .",
    "the analogue of a ( positive ) prime is a monic irreducible polynomial . to investigate arithmetic properties of `` typical '' integers ,",
    "one samples them uniformly in the dyadic interval @xmath6 $ ] with @xmath7 ; likewise to investigate arithmetic properties of `` typical '' polynomials , one samples them uniformly from the monic polynomials @xmath8 of degree @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "the prime number theorem ( pnt ) states that the number @xmath11 of primes @xmath12 is asymptotically equal to @xmath13 the riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the assertion that @xmath14    the prime polynomial theorem asserts that the number @xmath15 of monic irreducible polynomials of degree @xmath9 is @xmath16 the implied constant absolute .",
    "this corresponds to the pnt ( and to the riemann hypothesis ) if we map @xmath17 , recalling that @xmath18 is the number of positive integers up to @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the number of monic polynomials of degree @xmath9 .",
    "note that gives an asymptotic result whenever @xmath20 ; in comparison , the results described below will usually be valid only in the large finite field limit , that is @xmath9 fixed and @xmath21 .      for @xmath22 $ ] of positive degree @xmath9 , we say its cycle structure is @xmath23 if in the prime decomposition @xmath24 ( we allow repetition ) , we have @xmath25 . in particular @xmath26 .",

    "the cycle structure of a permutation @xmath35 of @xmath9 letters is @xmath36 if in the decomposition of @xmath35 as a product of disjoint cycles , there are @xmath37 cycles of length @xmath38 . for instance , @xmath39 is the number of fixed points of @xmath35 , and @xmath40 is the identity if and only if @xmath41 .",
    "moreover @xmath42 is an @xmath9-cycle if and only if @xmath43 .",
    "for each partition @xmath44 , denote by @xmath45 the probability that a random permutation on @xmath9 letters has cycle structure @xmath46 : @xmath47 cauchy s formula for @xmath45 is @xmath48 in particular , the proportion of @xmath9-cycles in the symmetric group @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "the connection between cycle structures of polynomials and of permutations is by means of the following observation , a straight - forward consequence of the prime polynomial theorem : given a partition @xmath51 , the probability that a random monic polynomial @xmath30 of degree @xmath9 has cycle structure @xmath46 is asymptotic , as @xmath21 , to the probability @xmath45 that a random permutation of @xmath9 letters has that cycle structure : @xmath52 note that unlike the prime polynomial theorem , this result gives an asymptotic only in the large finite field limit @xmath21 , @xmath9 fixed .",
    "having set up the preliminaries , i turn to discussing new results on quantitative aspects of arithmetic in @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "some of the most important problems in prime number theory concern the distribution of primes in short intervals and in arithmetic progressions . according to the prime number theorem , the density of primes near @xmath18 is @xmath53 .",
    "thus one wants to know what is the number @xmath54 of primes in an interval of length @xmath55 around @xmath18 : @xmath56 we expect that for @xmath57 sufficiently large , @xmath58 the pnt implies that holds for @xmath59 , and the riemann hypothesis gives for all @xmath60 . in 1930 , hoheisel gave an unconditional proof that holds for all @xmath61 for any positive @xmath62 ; this has since been improved , currently to @xmath63 ( heath brown 1988 ) .",
