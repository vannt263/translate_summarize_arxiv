    "according to bloch  @xcite , the possibility of persistent currents in a bosonic system in the ring geometry is determined by the _ yrast _ spectrum  @xcite . which is defined by the lowest energy state for a given total angular momentum @xmath0 . for a single - species system ,",
    "bloch  @xcite showed that the yrast spectrum takes the form e_0(l ) = + e_0(l ) , where @xmath1 is the total mass of the system , @xmath2 is the radius of the ring on which the bosons reside , and @xmath3 is a periodic function of the angular momentum with the properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 . here , @xmath6 is the number of particles of mass @xmath7 and @xmath8 is an integer .",
    "bloch argued that the system can support persistent currents at some non - zero angular momentum @xmath9 if @xmath10 is a local minimum .",
    "bloch s analysis can be extended to a binary mixture containing @xmath11 particles of mass @xmath12 and @xmath13 particles of mass @xmath14 . in general , the function @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is again the total angular momentum , exhibits a periodicity only if the mass ratio @xmath15 is a rational number . for the special case @xmath16 , which is realizable with bosons in different hyperfine states",
    ", @xmath3 retains the same periodicity as for the single - species system , but with @xmath17 . in terms of @xmath18 , the angular momentum per particle in units of @xmath19 , one has @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in this case , the behaviour of @xmath22 in the interval @xmath23 is sufficient to decide on the possibility of persistent currents .    for a single - spieces system of bosons interacting via a contact interaction ,",
    "the yrast spectrum was deterimined by lieb  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is defined by the so - called type - ii excitations which have been identified as soliton - like by comparing their energy with those of soliton states as obtained from a mean - field analysis  @xcite .",
    "although a similar identification has not been established for the binary system , it has generally been assumed that a mean - field analysis would provide a reasonably accurate approximation of the yrast spectrum in this case as well .",
    "determination of such a mean - field spectrum requires the knowledge of soliton solutions to coupled gross - pitaevskii equations .",
    "general solutions of this kind , expressed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions , were first obtained by porubov and parker  @xcite in the context of solving a manokov system of coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found these same solutions in the context of the binary bosonic mixture in the ring geometry and applied them to determine the mean - field yrast spectrum of a system with relatively weak interaction strength and small population imbalance .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to present a complete analysis of the mean - field yrast spectrum of a binary system with _",
    "arbitrary _ interaction strength and population imbalance .",
    "we find that the yrast spectrum reveals a surprisingly rich structure , not seen in refs .",
    "@xcite , as a result of the interplay of interaction and population imbalance .",
    "more importantly , our findings of the yrast spectrum provide a definitive answer to the question as to whether persistent currents occur at higher angular momenta .",
    "the first study of this kind for a binary system was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite wherein the authors determined a limited portion of the yrast spectrum . with this information",
    ", the authors concluded that an arbitrarily small concentration of the minority component , @xmath24 , would disrupt the possibility of persistent currents at higher angular momenta . on the other hand",
    ", we argued in a recent paper  @xcite that the yrast spectrum must revert , on the basis of continuity , to that of the single - species system in the @xmath25 limit . a semi - quantitative calculation of the yrast spectrum supported this physically obvious expectation , but a definitive explanation of how this occurred was not provided .",
    "the second purpose of the present paper is to analyze the @xmath25 limit in more detail using the analytic soliton solutions .",
    "this analysis confirms that the single - species results are recovered in the @xmath25 limit .",
    "however , this limit is reached in a surprisingly complex way with the emergence of distinct soliton - like states in different ranges of the angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a simple , analytic formula for the critical interaction strength above which persistent currents are shown to exist at arbitrarily high angular momenta .",
    "this provides an explicit affirmation of the general argument we gave in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "ii we review the soliton solutions of the gp equations for a binary mixture . in sec .",
    "iii we present a detailed analysis of the mean - field yrast spectrum for arbitrary interaction strengths and minority concentrations @xmath24 .",
    "this information is then used to investigate the possibility of persistent currents at higher angular momenta and explain in detail how the single - species limit is recovered for @xmath25 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in the final section .",
    "we consider an equal - mass , two - component bose gas in the one - dimensional ring geometry with repulsive interactions described by the following hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the effective interaction strength and @xmath28 distinguishes the two atomic species .",
