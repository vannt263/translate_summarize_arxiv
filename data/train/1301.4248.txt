    "for example , the presence of @xmath88pa ( belonging to the series of @xmath89u ) with a relatively high activity of 1 mbq / kg in 100 @xmath68 znmoo@xmath15 crystal will result in additional background due to random coincidence with @xmath1 events of @xmath90 counts/(kev@xmath91kg@xmath91y ) at @xmath2mo @xmath8 energy .",
    "this contribution is however much less important than that due to the @xmath1 decay alone .",
    "in addition , our simulations show that coincidence of @xmath1 signals with low energy events is not problematic , because of the quite steep shape of @xmath1 spectrum near @xmath8 .",
    "low energy signals due to spurious sources , like microphonic noise , which can in principle contribute with a high rate , are in general easily rejected in bolometers thanks to pulse shape discrimination . in conclusion ,",
    "while a generic source can be reduced by careful shielding , purification of materials , improvement of the noise figure and anti - coincidence technique , the random coincidence of @xmath1 events is a background hard to suppress , as it is related to the presence itself of the isotope under investigation .",
    "the possibilities to decrease this type of background at an acceptable level are discussed in the next section .",
    "a cryogenic bolometer  @xcite consists of an energy absorber ( a single diamagnetic dielectric crystal in @xmath3 applications ) thermally linked to a temperature sensor , that in some cases may be sensitive to out of equilibrium phonons .",
    "the heat signal , collected at very low temperatures ( typically @xmath92  mk for large bolometers ) , consists of a temperature rise of the whole detector determined by a nuclear event .",
    "the majority of the most promising high @xmath8-value ( @xmath93  mev ) candidates can be studied with the bolometric technique in the `` source = detector '' approach , joining high energy resolution and large efficiency  @xcite .",
    "ultra - pure crystals up to @xmath94  g can be grown with materials containing appealing candidates .",
    "arrays of the single crystalline modules allow achieving total masses of the order of @xmath94  kg  @xcite , necessary to explore the inverted hierarchy region .    an excellent choice for the bolometric material , performed in the cuoricino and cuore experiments  @xcite , consists of teo@xmath12 ( tellurite ) that has a very large ( 27% in mass ) natural content of the @xmath3 candidate @xmath11te . in terms of background ,",
    "the experience provided by teo@xmath12 searches  @xcite shows clearly that energy - degraded @xmath95  particles , emitted by the material surfaces facing the detectors or by the detector surfaces themselves , are expected to be the dominant contribution in all high @xmath8-value candidates , for which the signal falls in a region practically free of @xmath96  background .",
    "the @xmath95 background component however can be made negligible using scintillating or in general luminescent ( including cherencov light  @xcite ) bolometers .",
    "in fact , since the @xmath95 light yield is generally appreciably different from the @xmath0/@xmath96 light yield at equal deposited energy , while the thermal response is substantially equivalent , the simultaneous detection of light and heat signals , and the comparison of the respective amplitudes , represents a powerful tool for @xmath95/@xmath0 discrimination and therefore for @xmath95 background rejection  @xcite .",
    "scintillation photons are usually detected by a dedicated bolometer , in the form of a thin slab , opaque to the emitted light and equipped with its own temperature sensor .",
    "the light absorber , normally a ge , si or si - coated al@xmath12o@xmath97 slab , is placed close to a flat face of the main scintillating crystal .",
    "a wealth of prelimimary experimental results  @xcite show that this method is effective and @xmath95 rejection factors even much better than @xmath98% can be achieved .",
    "once that this discrimination capability of scintillating bolometer is taken into account , a detailed background analysis , based on reasonable assumptions on internal radioactive contamination , shows that a residual background level of @xmath99 counts/(kev@xmath91kg@xmath91y ) can be safely assumed  @xcite , opening the opportunity to explore the inverted hierarchy region of the neutrino mass pattern .",
    "however , the random coincidences of @xmath1 events discussed in section  [ sec : random ] need to be kept under control . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : irc ] ) , the rate of rc-@xmath1 events is proportional to the time resolution of the detector",
    ". therefore the time properties of the signal from a cryogenic detector play a crucial role in this form of background .    the large mass ( @xmath100  g ) , high energy resolution ( @xmath101  kev  fwhm at @xmath102  kev ) detectors developed for cuoricino and cuore  @xcite represent a sort of paradigma for @xmath3 decay bolometers , inspiring also other proposed experiments and the related r&d activities .",
    "as temperature sensors , neutron transmutation doped ( ntd ) ge elements are used , characterized by a high impedance ( 1 - 100 m@xmath103 ) and a high sensitivity ( @xmath104 ) . other promising solutions for the thermal sensors have been used  @xcite , but for the moment only the energy resolution and the reliability provided by ntd - ge - based bolometers seem to be compatible with a large - scale @xmath3 experiment . in these devices ,",
    "the ntd ge thermistor is glued to the teo@xmath12 crystal by means of a two - component epoxy .",
    "their time resolution is strictly related to the thermal - signal risetime .",
    "the temporal behaviour of the thermal pulse , and therefore its risetime , can be understood thanks to a thermal model for the whole detector , described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the model predicts that large mass detectors with ntd - ge readout have risetimes of the order of tens of milliseconds .",
    "this is confirmed experimentally in the cuoricino detectors , which exhibited pulse risetimes of the order of @xmath105  ms  @xcite .",
    "similar values are expected for any cryogenic bolometers with a volume of the order of 100 @xmath68 and based on ntd  ge  thermistors .",
    "faster risetimes could be observed if an important component of the energy reaches the thermistors in the form of athermal phonons , but this possibility depends critically on the nature of the main crystal and of the crystal - glue - thermistor interface .",
    "the most conservative approach consists in assuming the slow risetime evaluated and observed in teo@xmath12 bolometers .",
    "the time resolution of the main crystal can be made substantially shorter than the risetime , taking advantage of the excellent signal - to - noise ratio expected at the @xmath3 energy  @xcite , which is of the order of 2000 to 1 in teo@xmath12 crystals .",
    "( however , this high value is still to be proved for other bolometric materials relevant for @xmath3 decay . )",
    "even though the time resolution proved shorter by a factor 10 with respect to the present teo@xmath12 risetime values , and therefore around 5  ms , the background values reported in table  [ tab : contr ] should be multiplied by a factor 5 , bringing them above @xmath106  counts/(kev@xmath91kg@xmath91yr ) for @xmath2mo .",
    "background due to random coincidence of @xmath1 events would be then dominant .",
    "the advantage of scintillating bolometers , which promise to keep the other sources around or below @xmath84  counts/(kev@xmath91kg@xmath91yr ) @xcite , would be substantially compromised .    however , the simultaneous detection of light and heat which characterizes scintillating bolometers offers the possibility to control this problematic background source as well .",
    "in fact , a much faster risetime in the light - detector signal is expected , due to the much lower heat capacity of the energy absorber , which has now a mass of only a few grams at most . following the bolometer thermal model  @xcite ,",
    "the light - detector risetime can be reduced down to @xmath107  ms . assuming a similar time resolution , the @xmath1 background contribution is in the ranges shown in table  [ tab : contr ] thanks to the fast response provided by the light detector .",
    "scintillating bolometer : ( a ) pile - up of two pulses shifted by 3 ms with equal amplitude ; ( b ) pile - up of two pulses shifted by 3 ms with amplitude ratio equal to 4 ( the smaller pulse occurs first ) ; ( c ) a single pulse .",
    "the typical single - signal pulse shape , obtained by fitting an average pulse , is plotted as well ( dashed / blue lines ) . in all cases ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is that expected for a @xmath3 signal .",
    "the difference in shape between piled - up and single pulses is small , especially for unequal amplitudes , but appreciable.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the above discussion is simplified : the capability to discriminate two close - in - time events can not be reduced to a single parameter such as the detector time resolution @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , it depends smoothly on the temporal distance between the two events and on the ratio between their two amplitudes as well .",
    "furthermore , the pile - up discrimination capability is influenced by the signal - to - noise ratio in the light detector  @xcite and by the pulse shape and noise features .",
    "a complete analysis , whose details will be reported elsewhere in a dedicated publication , has been performed . in this letter , we present the main results of this investigation and the most important conclusions .    an experiment based on modules of zn@xmath2moo@xmath15 crystals was considered .",
    "we have used pulse shapes and noise from a _ real _ light detector , of the same type as those described in  @xcite , coupled to a znmoo@xmath15 scintillating crystal .",
    "the pile - up phenomenon was studied by generating light pulses with the observed experimental shape on top of experimental noisy baselines .",
    "in particular , pair of pulses were generated with random time distances with a flat distribution up to 10  ms  in fact , the interarrival time distribution is practically constant over the @xmath108 $ ]  ms range ( this is the relevant time interval since it allows to fully explore the most problematic pile - up case , i.e. that occurring on the pulse risetime which is of the order of 3  ms ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] , two pile - up emblematic cases ( both with 3  ms time separation ) extracted from the performed simulation are shown , along with a single pulse as a reference .    as a first step , we defined a 90% efficiency in accepting a pulse from the light detector as a potentially good @xmath3 pulse using opportune signal filtering and three different pulse - shape indicators : ( i ) the risetime from 15% to 90% of the maximum amplitude ; ( ii ) the @xmath109 evaluated using an average pulse as a standard shape function ; ( iii ) the pulse shape parameter defined in  @xcite which also uses a standard pulse - shape function .",
    "the rejection efficiency of piled - up pulses was then tested . in each pulse pair , the amplitude of the first pulse @xmath110 was extracted by sampling the @xmath1 distribution , while the amplitude of the second pulse @xmath111 was chosen as @xmath8(@xmath2mo)@xmath112 , where @xmath59 is a random component in the interval @xmath113 $ ]  kev .",
    "the generated pulse amplitudes were chosen so as to fix the signal - to - noise ratio at the level expected for a @xmath3 signal , i.e. of the order of 30 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] ; in fact , the typical light energy collected by the light detectors in znmoo@xmath15 scintillating bolometers realized so far is of the order of 1  kev for 1  mev energy in the heat channel  @xcite , while the typical rms noise of the light detector can be conservatively taken as 100  ev , although values as low as 30  ev were observed  @xcite .",
    "the piled - up pulses generated in the simulation were analyzed with the mentioned pulse - shape indicators . using the risetime ( after low - pass filtering ) , an excellent pile - up rejection efficiency was obtained .",
    "a comparison between the risetime distribution for genuine single pulses and piled - up pulses generated as described above is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtdistr ] .",
    "more quantitatively , the same procedure that retains 90% of genuine single pulses rejects 80%90% of piled - up pulses when their sum amplitude is in the region of @xmath8 and the difference between the arrival times of the two pulses covers uniformly the interval @xmath108 $ ]  ms . for example",
    ", the analysis of the sample reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtdistr ] excludes 83% of piled - up pulses when accepting 90% of good pulses .",
    "the other two indicators provide equivalent or even better results .",
    "however , we prefer here to consider conservatively the results obtained with the method of the risetime , as this parameter is an intrinsic property of each signal that does not require the comparison with a standard shape .",
    "this comparison in fact implies a delicate synchronization between the single pulse and the standard - shape pulse that will be discussed in the mentioned more complete work .",
    "the results of the simulation show that the contribution to the background of the piled - up events is substantially equivalent to that obtained when assuming a time resolution @xmath60 of 1  ms in eq .",
    "[ eq : brc ] ( since 80%  90% of the pulses are rejected in the region of @xmath3 decay inside a pile - up relevant range of 10  ms ) , and therefore confirming the evaluation for znmoo@xmath15 reported in table  [ tab : contr ] .",

    "<S> two neutrino double @xmath0 decay can create irremovable background even in high energy resolution detectors searching for neutrinoless double @xmath0 decay due to random coincidence of @xmath1 events in case of poor time resolution . </S>",
    "<S> possibilities to suppress this background in cryogenic scintillating bolometers are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the present bolometric detector technologies enable to control this form of background at the level required to explore the inverted hierarchy of the neutrino mass pattern , including the case of bolometers searching for the neutrinoless double @xmath0 decay of @xmath2mo , which is characterized by a relatively short two neutrino double @xmath0 decay half - life . </S>"
