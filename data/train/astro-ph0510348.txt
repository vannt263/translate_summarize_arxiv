    "gammma - ray bursts ( grbs ) were discovered serendipitously as  flashes in the sky \" by the nuclear test - ban monitoring satellites vela ( us ) and konus ( ussr ) .",
    "these were soon recognized to be a natural phenomenon .",
    "the first data were publicly released by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mysterious origin of this new astrophysical transient , lasting up to tens of seconds in non - thermal gamma - ray radiation , gradually triggered a huge interest from the high - energy astrophysics community .",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on nasa s compton gamma - ray observatory , launched in 1991 , identified an isotropic distribution in the sky and revealed the existence of short and long gamma - ray bursts , whose durations are broadly distributed around 0.3s and 30s , respectively @xcite .",
    "moreover , the sensitivity of batse showed a deficit in faint bursts in the number - versus - intensity distribution distinct from a -3/2 powerlaw .",
    "@xcite hereby established that gamma - ray bursts are of cosmological origin .",
    "more recently , the italian - dutch satellite bepposax discovered x - ray flashes @xcite , which may be closely related to long gamma - ray bursts .",
    "their non - thermal emissions are herein best accounted for by internal shocks in ultrarelativistic outflows in the fireball model proposed by @xcite  with unknown inner engine producing these baryon - poor outflows . if gravitationally powered , their compact size , based on short - time scale variabilities in the gamma - ray lightcurves , may involve the formation of black holes surrounded by a high - mass torus @xcite .    at cosmological distances , the isotropic equivalent luminosities are on the order of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1  as bright as @xmath2 solar luminosities .",
    "these events , widely acclaimed as the  biggest bang since the big bang \" , are now known to light up the universe about once per minute .",
    "what , then , is their origin ?",
    "the most powerful observational method to encyst the enigmatic energy source is through _ calorimetry on all radiation channels_. this involves measuring the energy output in emissions in the electromagnetic spectrum , as well as in yet  unseen \" emissions in neutrinos and gravitational waves .",
    "perhaps thus shall we be in a position to determine their constitution , and decide whether their inner engine is _ baryonic _ , such as a neutron star , or _",
    "non - baryonic _ : a black hole energized by spin .",
    "the exact solution of roy p. @xcite  see table i for a parametrization  shows an energy per unit mass which is anomalously large at high spin rates , exceeding that of a rapidly spinning neutron by an order of magnitude . by this potentially large and baryon - free energy reservoir ,",
    "a kerr black hole is a leading candidate for the inner engine of grbs , at least those of long - durations in view of the following observational results .",
    "the italian - dutch bepposax satellite , launched in 1996 , dramatically changed the landscape of long grbs with the discovery by e. costa @xcite of x - ray afterglows in grb970228 ( confirmed in observations by the asca and rosat satellites ) .",
    "these lower - energy emissions permit accurate localizations , enabling follow - up by optical telescopes .",
    "thus , j. van paradijs @xcite pointed the isaac newton telescope and the william herschel telescope to further discover optical emissions associated with the same event . these lower - energy x - ray and optical emissions agree remarkably well with the expected decay of shocks in ultrarelativistic , baryon - poor outflows in the previously developed fireball model .",
    "even lower - energy , radio - afterglows have been observed in some cases , including grb970228 @xcite .",
    "the same optical observations have now led to tens of grbs with individually measured redshifts , up to @xmath3 in grb050904 detected by the recently launched swift satellite @xcite .",
    "optical follow - up identified the association of long grbs with supernovae .",
    "in particular , the unambiguous association of grb030329 with sn2003dh ( @xmath4mpc ) @xcite identified type ib / c supernovae as the parent population of long grbs ( fig .",
    "1 ) . this observation confirms their association with core - collapse supernovae of massive stars , proposed by s. woosley @xcite .",
    "massive stars have characteristically short lifetimes , whereby grb - supernovae track the cosmological event rate .",
    "this conclusion is quantitatively confirmed by consistent estimates of the true - to - observed grb - sne event rate of 450 - 500 deduced from two independent analysis , based on geometrical beaming factors @xcite and locking to the star - formation rate @xcite .",
    "these event rates correspond to a true cosmological event rate of about one per minute .",
    "core - collapse supernovae from massive stars are believed to produce neutron stars or black holes .",
    "the former are perhaps best known from the rapidly spinning neutron star ( a pulsar ) in the crab nebula , a remnant of what was probably a type ii supernova in 1054 .",
    "the second is more difficult to ascertain with certainty , such as in the more recent type ii event sn1987 in the large megellanic cloud . at close proximity ,",
    "its burst in mev - neutrinos was detected by kamiokanda and imb ( see @xcite ) which provided direct evidence for the formation of matter at nuclear densities .",
    "the absence of a pulsar or a point - source of x - ray radiation in this case suggests continued collapse  probably into a stellar mass black hole .",
    "type ii and type ib / c supernovae are both believed to represent the endpoint of massive stars @xcite , and possibly so in binaries such as the type ii / ib event sn1993j @xcite .",
    "this binary association suggests a hierarchy , wherein hydrogen - rich , envelope  retaining snii are associated with wide binaries , while hydrogen - poor , envelope  stripped snib and snic are associated with increasingly compact binaries @xcite . by tidal coupling ,",
    "the primary star in the latter will rotate at approximately the orbital period at the moment of core  collapse . with an evolved core @xcite ,",
    "these type ib / c events in particular are believed to produce a spinning black hole @xcite .",
    "however , the branching ratio of type ib / c into grb - supernovae is small , @xmath5 as calculated from the true grb - supernova event rate relative to the observed event rates of supernovae of type ii and type ib / c .",
    "this ratio is remarkably small , suggesting a higher - order down - selection process .",
    "the identification of long grbs with core - collapse supernovae brings into scope their potential gravitational - wave emissions .",
    "this may be due to a variety of mechanisms associated with rapidly rotating fluids .",
    "in particular , emissions will be produced by bar - mode instabilities producing fragmentation of orbiting matter prior to the formation of a compact object @xcite or in the formation of multiple compact objects @xcite , non - axisymmetries in accretion disks @xcite , as well as after the formation into a rapidly spinning black hole .",
    "the first may produce an initial  splash \" of gravitational radiation @xcite , the second a bi - model spectrum containing high - frequency emissions produced by non - axisymmetric perturbations of the black hole and low - frequency emissions from the disk , whereas the latter creates a long - duration burst of low - frequency gravitational radiation .",
    "calculations this time - evolving spectrum of gravitational - radiation are only beginning to be addressed by computational hydro- and magnetohydrodynamics , during initial collapse @xcite and in the formation of a non - axisymmetric torus @xcite .",
    "emissions from matter surrounding a stellar - mass black hole are in the frequency range of sensitivity of the gravitational - wave experiments ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite .",
    "understanding their wave - forms can serve strategic search - and - detection algorithms , triggered by gamma - ray observations @xcite or by their associated supernova .",
    "the latter is more common by the aforementioned true - to - observed event ratio of grb - supernovae .    in this review",
    ", we shall discuss a theory of grbs from rotating black holes .",
    "current phenomenology on grb - supernovae poses a challenge to model    * the durations of long grbs of tens of seconds * the formation of an associated aspherical supernova * the launch of ultrarelativistic jets with beamed gamma - ray emissions * a small branching ratio of type ib / c supernovae into grbs of less than @xmath6    this phenomenology will be directly linked to the spin energy of the black hole .",
    "quite generally , we are left with the task of modeling all possible radiation channels produced by the putative kerr black hole , including gravitational radiation , mev - neutrino emissions , and magnetic winds .",
    "just as lower - energy x - ray and optical afterglow emissions linked long grbs to supernovae , we expect that the detection of a contemporaneous burst in gravitational - radiation will lift the veil on their enigmatic inner  engine",
    ". a precise determination of this link will enable the identification of a kerr black hole .",
    "the same might apply to type ii and type ib / c supernovae .",
    "understanding the energy source of long grbs might tell us also about the constitution of short grbs .",
    "the first _",
    "faint _ x - ray afterglows have been detected of the short event grb050509b by swift @xcite and grb050709 by hete - ii @xcite , further providing the low redshifts @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the nature of host galaxies , preferably ( older ) elliptical galaxies for short bursts versus ( young ) star - forming galaxies for long bursts , supports the origin of short events in binary coalescence of black holes and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "after completion of this review , @xcite outlined a very interesting prospect for long - lasting supernova - like signatures to short bursts from the debris of a neutron star binary coalescence with a similar partner or black hole .",
    "earlier , we explained the dichotomy of short and long events in terms of hyper- and suspended accreting onto slowly and rapidly rotating black holes , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , we predicted similar x - ray afterglows with the property that those to short events are relatively faint : _ the short burst is identical to the final moment of a long burst of gamma - rays_. hyperaccreting , slowly rotating black holes can be produced through various channels .",
    "black - hole neutron star binaries are remnants of core - collapse events in binaries ( @xcite ; unless formed by capture in dense stellar clusters ) .",
    "any rapidly spinning black hole will be spun - down in the core - collapse process , possibly representing a prior grb - supernova event ( this review ) .",
    "the merger of a neutron star onto a black hole @xcite could produce a state of hyperaccretion and produce a short gamma - ray burst .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the predominance of long over short events .",
    "less clear is the potential for gamma - ray emissions from the merger of two neutron stars ( e.g. @xcite ) which , however , should also produce a slowly rotating black hole .",
    "finally , slowly rotating black holes can also be produced in core - collapse of massive star in isolation or a wide binary . here as well ,",
    "may detection of their gravitational - wave emissions provide a probe to differentiate amongst these different types of short bursts .    in  2 , we give a practical outlook on kerr black holes and gravitational radiation . in  3 , we review the formation and evolution ( kick - velocities , growth and spin  down ) of kerr black holes in core  collapse supernovae .",
    "this includes the process of converting spin  energy into radiation and estimates on the lifetime of rapid spin . in  4 , we calculate multipole mass - moments in a torus due to a hydrodynamical instability . by asymptotic analysis ,",
    "the energies in the various radiation channels are given in  5 .",
    "an mechanism for launching ultrarelativistic jets from rotating black holes by a small fraction of black hole spin is given in  6 .",
    "specific predictions for these  flashes \" as sources for the observatories ligo and virgo are given in  7 .",
    "kerr black holes and gravitational radiation are two of the most dramatic predictions of general relativity ( other than cosmology ) . while evidence for kerr black holes , in particular in their role as powerful inner engines , remains elusive ,",
    "the quadrupole formula for gravitational radiation has been confirmed observationally with great accuracy .",
    "the kerr metric describes an exact solution of a black hole spacetime with nonzero angular momentum .",
    "it demonstrates the remarkable property of _ frame - dragging _ : the angular velocity @xmath9 of otherwise zero - angular momentum observers in spacetime outside the black hole .",
    "frame - dragging assumes a maximal and constant angular velocity @xmath10 on the event horizon of the black hole , and decays with the cube of the distance to zero at large distances .",
    "this introduces an angular velocity @xmath10 of the black hole , as well as _",
    "frame - dragging by a non - zero gradient ( whereby it is not gauge effect ) . the aforementioned energy reservoir in angular momentum satisfies , @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the specific angular momentum of the black hole per unit mass .",
    "here , we use geometric units with newton s constant @xmath13 and velocity of light @xmath14 .",
    "these properties give kerr black holes the potential to react energetically to their environment .",
    "they hereby have to potential of serving as universal sources of energy , distinct from any known baryonic object and with direct relevance to the phenomenology of grbs .",
    "rotating objects have a general tendency to radiate away their energy and angular momentum in an effort to reach a lower energy state . in the dynamics of rotating fluids",
    ", this is described by the well - known rayleigh stability criterion . in many ways ,",
    "black hole radiation processes are governed by the same principle .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics @xmath15 for the entropy @xmath16 shows that the specific angular momentum of a kerr black hole @xmath17 ) increases with radiation : @xmath18 for a black hole of mass @xmath19 and angular momentum @xmath20 which emits a particle with specific angular momentum @xmath21 .",
    "generally , black holes in isolation are stable by exponential suppression of spontaneous emissions by canonical angular momentum barriers @xcite . fortunately , magnetic fields can modulate and suppress these angular momentum barriers .",
    "the earliest studies of active black holes focus on energy - extraction processes in the ergosphere , i.e. : scattering of positive energy waves onto rotating black holes  superradiant scattering of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite  as a continuous - wave analogue to the process of @xcite .",
    "a steady - state variation can be found in the process of spin  down through horizon maxwell stresses , proposed @xcite and extended to force - free magnetospheres by @xcite . quite generally ,",
    "therefore , magnetic fields are required as a mediating agent to stimulate luminosities which are of astrophysical interest .",
    "generally , stellar mass black holes produced in core - collapse of a massive star are parametrized by their mass , angular momentum and kick velocity @xmath22 .",
    "the equilibrium electric charge of the black hole which arises in its lowest magnetic energy state , is relevant in sustaining adequate horizon magnetic flux especially at high spin  rates , but is insignificant relative to the spin - energy of the black hole .",
    "gravitational - wave emissions are predominantly due to low multipole mass - moments .",
    "the quadrupole radiation formula according to the linearized theory of general relativity has been given by @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a function of the ellipticity @xmath25 of a binary with orbital frequency @xmath9 and chirp mass @xmath26 .",
    "this linearized result has been observationally confirmed to within 0.1% by decade - long observations of the hulse - taylor binary neutron star system psr1913 + 16 ( with ellipticity @xmath27 , @xcite ) .",
    "its gravitational - wave luminosity of about about @xmath28 of a solar luminosity @xmath29 erg  s@xmath1 gives a binary lifetime of about 7.4 gyr .",
    "encouraged by this observational confirmation , we apply ( [ eqn_pm ] ) to a non - axisymmetric matter surrounding a black hole . with orbital period @xmath30 , @xmath31 and ellipticity @xmath32 ,",
    "this predicts @xmath33 the quadrupole moment is due to a mass - inhomogeneity @xmath34 in the torus .",
    "a quadrupole moment appears spontaneously due to non - axisymmetric waves , such as a hydrodynamical or magnetohydrodynamical instability .",
    "a detailed description of radiation by all multipole mass - moments in a torus is given in @xcite .",
    "these existing approaches to energy extraction from rotating black holes do not elucidate the  loading problem : \" the diversity in radiation channels and their various energy outputs .",
    "this defines a novel challenge for kerr black holes as inner engines to gamma - ray bursts .",
    "these events , perhaps including core - collapse supernovae , pose the potential for a powerful link between kerr black holes and gravitational radiation , as outlined below .",
    "while all snib / c might be producing black holes , only some are associated with grb - supernovae in view of the observed small branching ratio ( [ eqn_branching ] ) .",
    "black holes produced in _",
    "aspherical _ core - collapse receive typical kick velocities of a few hundred km s@xmath1 @xcite , measured relative to the center of mass of the progenitor star .",
    "such objects inevitably escape from the central high - density region of the progenitor star , even before core - collapse is completed .",
    "a small sample of black holes receive low kick - velocities at birth . remaining centered , these grow into rapidly spinning high - mass black holes by infall of a substantial fraction of the progenitor he - core mass ( fig .",
    "this forms a starting point for the parametrization of rotating black holes as inner engines to grb - supernovae .",
    "the state of matter surrounding the newly formed black hole in core - collapse supernovae is unique , in attaining temperatures of in excess of 1mev @xcite and masses of up to a few percent of the mass of the black hole @xcite .",
    "we further expect these accretion disks to be magnetized , representing a remnant magnetic field of the progenitor star and modified by a dynamo action in the disk .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath10 of the black hole easily exceeds that of surrounding matter , even at relatively low spin - energies .",
    "when a surrounding disk is largely unmagnetized , the black hole continues to accrete , enlarging it and spinning it up towards an extreme kerr black hole along a _ bardeen trajectory _",
    "@xcite , shown in fig .",
    "2 . alternatively , the surrounding matter can be magnetized and , fairly generally , may contain an appreciable @xmath35 component of poloidal flux on average or , when time - variable , with non - zero standard deviation .",
    "topologically , this component represents a uniform magnetization , corresponding to two counter - oriented current rings @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "a torus can form in a state of suspended accretion with angular velocity @xmath36 .",
    "this introduces a channel for _ catalytic _ conversion of spin  energy into various radiation channels @xcite , forcing the black hole to spin down until the angular velocities become similar @xmath37 .      a magnetized torus surrounding a black hole",
    "is expected to form in both black hole - neutron star coalescence and core  collapse of a massive star with very similar topological properties ( fig .",
    "a magnetized star can be represented to leading order by a single current loop or equivalently a density of magnetic dipole moments .",
    "stretching is around the black hole , as in tidal break - up , or by excision of the center of the star , as in core - collapse into a new black hole , leaves a magnetized annulus consisting of two counter - oriented current rings .",
    "thus , core - collapse supernovae and binary black hole - neutron - star coalescence both give the same outcome : a black hole surrounded by a magnetized torus .",
    "in practice , the resulting magnetic field will be modified by turbulence and , possibly , a dynamo .",
    "we can look at the structure of the magnetic field of a torus by inspecting its shape in a poloidal cross - section , and by comparison with pulsar magnetospheres . in case of a pulsar , we see magnetic flux - surfaces of closed magnetic field - lines that reach an outer light cylinder , while open magnetic field - lines extend outwards to infinity .",
    "the same structure is found with regards to the torus outer face , when viewed in poloidal cross - section .",
    "since the event horizon of the black hole is a null - surface , it has the same radiative boundary condition as asymptotic infinity @xcite , except for its finite surface area ( and surface gravity ) .",
    "it follows that the structure of magnetic field - lines found in a magnetized neutron star also applies to the torus inner face . for the same reason that a spinning neutron star transfers angular momentum to infinity , the inner face of the torus gains angular momentum from the black hole , whenever the latter spins more rapidly",
    "this produces a _",
    "connection by topological equivalence to pulsars_.    angular momentum transport is by alfvn waves emitted from the surface of the torus , carrying positive angular momentum waves off the outer face to infinity and negative angular momentum off the inner face into the black hole . in this process",
    ", the outer face becomes sub - keplerian and the inner face becomes super - keplerian .",
    "on balance of the competing torques between these two faces @xcite , this produces a state of suspended accretion @xcite .",
    "the angular velocity of a kerr black hole can reach @xmath38 , which far surpasses that of an accretion disk or torus .",
    "the black - hole spin  energy ( [ eqn_rot ] ) can be transferred to a torus with angular velocity @xmath39 with efficiency @xmath40 the task is now to quantify the various radiation channels provided by the torus .",
    "we shall discuss these in the next sections .",
    "the process of formation and spin  down of a kerr black hole has been proposed to quantitatively model the supernovae by various groups @xcite .",
    "this approach represents a special case of aspherical , magneto - rotationally driven core - collapse supernovae , notably discussed for type ii supernovae by @xcite .",
    "a given torus can support a finite poloidal magnetic field - energy .",
    "this is due to an instability , produced by magnetic moment - magnetic moment self - interactions in the fluid .",
    "instability criteria can be derived for both tilt and buckling @xcite . for a tilt instability between two counter - oriented current rings , representing a uniformly magnetized torus , these interactions are described by a potential @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the magnetic moment dipole moment of the inner ring , @xmath43 denotes the magnetic field produced by the outer ring , and @xmath44 denotes the angle between @xmath42 and @xmath43 . note that @xmath45 has period @xmath46 , is maximal ( minimal ) when @xmath42 and @xmath43 are parallel ( antiparallel ) . for the buckling instability ,",
    "the same interaction energies arise in the azimuthal partition of the torus into small current rings which , combined , are equivalent to the two counter - oriented current rings .",
    "the central potential well of the black hole provides a stabilizing contribution .",
    "as the magnetic moment - magnetic moment interactions act primarily to introduce vertical displacements between two current rings ( about their equilibrium configuration in the equatorial plane ) , we can focus on vertical displacements of fluid elements along surfaces of constant cylindrical radius @xmath47 .",
    "this is distinct from motions of a rigid ring , whose fluid elements move on surfaces of constant spherical radius . in particular , the tilt of a current ring hereby changes the distance to the central black hole according to @xmath48 . in the approximation of equal mass in the inner and outer face of the torus ,",
    "simultaneous tilt of one ring upwards and the other ring downwards is associated with the potential energy ( @xcite , corrected ) @xmath49 with @xmath50 upon averaging over all segments of a ring .",
    "note that @xmath51 has period @xmath52 and is minimal at @xmath53 .",
    "similar expressions hold for an azimuthal distribution of current rings .",
    "stability is accomplished provided that the total potential energy @xmath54 satisfies @xmath55 .",
    "we find the following poloidal magnetic field - to - kinetic energy ratios @xmath56 in the approximation @xmath57 , representing the poloidal magnetic field - energy of the inner torus magnetosphere in a characteristic volume @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we next discuss the physical parameters at this point of critical stability , which we interpret as a practical limit on the magnetic field energy that the torus can support .    for a pair of rings of radii @xmath60 , @xmath61",
    ", we have @xmath62 , so that the point of critical stability , @xmath63 , gives for the critical magnetic field - strength @xmath64 , or @xmath65 with critical poloidal magnetic field - energy ( [ eqn_eb1 ] ) .    rotating black holes with @xmath66 dissipate most of their spin  energy  unseen \" in the event horizon .",
    "the lifetime of rapid spin is thus @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the horizon flux , taking into account that most of the black - hole luminosity is incident onto the inner face of the torus .",

    "this provides a spontaneous mechanism for the creation of multipole mass - moments . provided",
    "that the torus is not completely disrupted , such multipole mass - moments ensure that the torus is luminous in gravitational radiation , when its mass reaches a few percent of that of the black hole .",
    "these instabilities can take the form of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "@xcite describe a hydrodynamic buckling instability in infinitesimally slender tori , due to a coupling of surface waves on a super - keplerian inner face and a sub - keplerian outer face .",

    "eventually , the expanding remnant envelope becomes optically thin , which permits the appearance of x - ray line - emissions excited by the underlying continuum emission @xmath116 by dissipating @xmath102 .",
    "the estimate ( [ eqn_sn ] ) is in remarkable agreement with the kinetic energy @xmath117 erg of the aspherical supernova sn1998bw associated with grb980425 @xcite .",
    "the energy output in mev - neutrinos is intermediate , in being smaller than @xmath101 by an additional factor given by the slenderness parameter @xmath118 , where @xmath119 denotes the ratio of minor - to - major radius of the torus and @xmath76 its rotation index ( [ eqn_ome ] ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath120 where @xmath121 . at the associated dissipation rate ,",
    "the torus develops a temperature of a few mev which stimulates the production of baryon - rich winds @xcite .",
    "frame - dragging induced by angular momentum extends through the environment of the black hole and includes the spin  axis .",
    "the kerr metric provides an exact description of this gravitational induction process by the riemann tensor @xcite . in turn",
    ", the riemann tensor couples to spin @xcite .",
    "specific angular momentum ( angular momentum per unit mass ) represents a rate of change of surface area per unit of time , while the riemann tensor is of dimension @xmath122 ( in geometrical units ) .",
    "therefore , curvature  spin coupling produces a force ( dimensionless in geometrical units ) , whereby test particles with spin follow non - geodesic trajectories @xcite . in practical terms",
    ", the latter holds promise as a mechanism for _ linear acceleration_. by dimensional analysis once more , the gravitational potential for spin  aligned interactions satisfy @xmath123 where @xmath9 denotes the local frame - dragging angular velocity produced by the black hole ( or any other spinning object ) and @xmath124 is the angular momentum of the particle at hand . spinning bodies therefore couple to spinning bodies @xcite .",
    "thus , ( [ eqn_eo ] ) defines a mechanism for accelerating baryon - poor ejecta to ultrarelativistic velocities , provided @xmath124 is large .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath124 of charged particles in strong magnetic fields , confined to individual magnetic flux - surfaces in radiative landau states , is macroscopic in the form of orbital angular momentum @xmath125 here @xmath25 denotes the elementary charge and @xmath68 denotes the enclosed magnetic flux , where @xmath126 denotes the electromagnetic vector potential of an open magnetic flux - tube along the spin  axis of the black hole .",
    "geometrically , the specific angular momentum represents the rate of change of surface area traced out by the orbital motion of the charged particle , by  helical motion \" as seen in four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "combined , ( [ eqn_eo ] ) and ( [ eqn_eo1 ] ) describe a powerful mechanism for linear acceleration of baryon - poor matter .",
    "it radically differs from the common view , that black - hole energetic processes are limited exclusively to the action of frame - dragging in the ergosphere .",
    "it is instructive to derive ( [ eqn_eo ] ) by specializing to the kerr metric on the spin  axis of the black hole . to this end",
    ", we may consider one - half the difference in potential energy of particles with angular momenta @xmath127 suspended in a gravitational field about a rotating object .",
    "in the first case , we note that the riemann tensor @xmath128 expressed relative to tetrad elements associated with boyer - lindquist coordinates @xcite gives rise to a linear force @xmath129 which can be integrated along the spin  axis to give @xmath130 in the second case , we merely assume a metric @xmath131 with time - like and azimuthal killing vectors and consider two particles with velocity four - vectors @xmath132 according to angular momenta @xmath133 , @xmath134 which shows that @xmath135 is the same for both particles . the total energy of the particles @xmath136 gives rise to @xmath137    to apply ( [ eqn_eo]-[eqn_eo1 ] ) to gamma - ray bursts from rotating black holes , consider a perfectly conducting blob of charged particles in a magnetic flux - tube subtended at a finite half - opening angle @xmath138 on the event horizon of the black hole and along its spin  axis . in the approximation of electrostatic equilibrium",
    ", it assumes a rigid rotation @xcite described by an angular velocity @xmath139 .",
    "( by faraday induction , differential rotation introduce potential differences along magnetic field - lines .",
    "some differential rotation is inevitable over long length scales and , possibly , in the formation of gaps ) . in the frame of zero - angular momentum observers ,",
    "the equilibrium charge - density assumes the value of @xcite , as viewed by zero - angular momentum observers .",
    "thus , given a number @xmath140 of charged particles per unit scale height @xmath141 in the flux - tube , @xmath142 a pair of blobs of scale height @xmath143 in both directions along the spin  axis of the black hole each hereby receive a potential energy @xmath144 where @xmath145 g and @xmath146 is a quantity of order unity , expressed in terms of the normalised angular velocities @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "electrons and positrons in superstrong magnetic fields are essentially massless .",
    "the ejection of a pair of blobs with energy ( [ eqn_eb ] ) thus takes place in a light - crossing time of about 0.3ms of , e.g. , seven solar mass black hole of linear dimension @xmath149 cm .",
    "this corresponds to in an instantaneous luminosity of about @xmath150erg / s .",
    "this produces a total kinetic energy output of up to @xmath151 erg in tens of seconds in long bursts . a fraction hereof which will be dissipated in gamma - rays and lower - energy afterglow emissions in the internal - external shock model for grbs @xcite .",
    "similar results obtain by considering the luminosity in a steady - state limit , by considering a horizon half - opening angle @xmath152 , set by the poloidal curvature @xmath153 of the magnetic field - lines .",
    "we note the paradoxical _ small _ energy output of grb - afterglow emissions , when viewed relative to the total black - hole spin  energy ( [ eqn_rot ] ) .",
    "the luminosity in the jet scales with the square of the enclosed magnetic flux , while the latter scales with the enclosed surface area , and hence the square of the half - opening angle @xmath138 .",
    "thus , we encounter a geometrical scale - factor , which creates a jet luminosity @xmath154 even when @xmath138 is not small , e.g. , about @xmath155 degrees , this scaling creates a small parameter .",
    "integrated over time , the energy output in gamma - rays satisfies @xcite @xmath156 consistent with the observed true energy output @xmath150 erg in gamma - rays of long bursts @xcite , where @xmath157 and @xmath158 denotes the efficiency of converting kinetic energy to gamma - rays .    in our unification scheme ,",
    "the durations of short and long bursts are attributed to different spin - down times of , respectively , a slowly and rapidly spinning black hole according to ( [ eqn_ts ] ) .",
    "the total energy output in gamma - rays of short grbs is hereby significantly smaller than that of long grbs , due to both shorter durations and smaller luminosities . in this light",
    ", the recent x - ray afterglow detections to short bursts , very similar but fainter than their counterparts to long bursts , are encouraging .",
    "the output in gravitational radiation ( [ eqn_egw ] ) is in the range of sensitivity of the broad band detectors ligo and virgo shown in fig .",
    "5 , as well as geo @xcite and tama @xcite . note that the match is better for higher - mass black holes , in view of their emissions at lower frequencies ( towards the minimum in the detector noise curve ) and their larger energy output .",
    "matched filtering gives a theoretical upper bound on the signal - to - noise ratio in the detection of long bursts in gravitational radiation from grb - supernovae . in practice , the frequency will be unsteady at least on an intermittent timescale associated with the evolution of the torus , e.g. , due to mass - loss in winds and possibly mass - gain by accretion from additional matter falling in .",
    "for this reason , a time - frequency trajectory method which correlates the coefficients of a fourier transformation over subsequent windows of durations of seconds might apply .",
    "the ultimate signal - to - noise ratio will therefore be intermediate between that obtained through correlation  a second - order procedure  and matched filtering  a first - order procedure .",
    "the results shown in fig . 5 show the maximal attainable signal - to - noise ratio ( by matched filtering ) for sources at a fiducial distance of 100mpc .",
    "this distance corresponds to an event rate of one per year .",
    "grb - supernovae are an astrophysical source population locked to the star - formation rate .",
    "we can calculate their contribution to the stochastic background in gravitational radiation accordingly given their band - limited signals , assuming @xmath159 of around 10% , where @xmath160 denotes the average gravitational - wave frequency in the comoving frame . in what follows ,",
    "we the following scaling relations are applied , @xmath161 where @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164hz@xmath165 , assuming maximal spin  rates ( @xmath166 ) . for non - extremal black holes , a commensurate reduction factor in energy output can be inserted .",
    "this factor carries through proportionally to the final results , whence it is not taken into account explicitly .",
    "summation over a uniform distribution of black hole masses , e.g. , @xmath167 , and assuming that the black hole mass and @xmath108 in ( [ eqn_eta ] ) , are uncorrelated , the expected spectral energy - density satisfies @xcite @xmath168 where @xmath169max@xmath170 is a normalized frequency distribution . the associated dimensionless amplitude @xmath171 , where @xmath172 and @xmath173 denotes newton s constant satisfies @xmath174 where @xmath175max@xmath176 , @xmath177 , likewise , we have for the spectral closure density @xmath178 relative to the closure density @xmath179 @xmath180 where @xmath181max@xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 denotes the hubble constant .",
    "these cosmological results show a simple scaling relation for the extremal value of the spectral closure density in its dependency on the model parameter @xmath108 . the location of the maximum scales with @xmath185 in view of @xmath186 .",
    "the spectral closure density thus becomes completely determined by the shape of the function representing the star - formation rate , the fractional grb - supernova rate thereof , @xmath108 , and the black - hole mass distribution .",
    "5 shows the various distributions .",
    "the extremal value of @xmath187 is in the neighborhood of the location of maximal sensitivity of ligo and virgo .",
    "it would be of interest to search for this contribution to the stochastic background in gravitational waves by correlation in the spectral domain , following fourier transformation over series of sub - windows on intermediate timescales of seconds .",
    "the sixties saw two independent discoveries : the first grb670702 by the vela satellite and the exact solution of rotating black holes by roy p. kerr . through observational campaigns with batse , bepposax , the interplanetary network ( ipn ) , hete - ii and now swift , we have come to understand the phenomenology of grbs .",
    "long bursts are association with supernovae , representing a rare and extraordinary powerful cosmological transient , taking place about once a minute and reaching the earliest epochs in the universe . independently , through the works of @xcite and others , we have come to understand the potential significance of kerr black holes as compact , baryon - free energy sources with certain universal properties .",
    "the applications to high - energy astrophysics should be enormous ( e.g. @xcite ) , of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei including our own galaxy @xcite , and of stellar mass black holes in microquasars @xcite and , possibly , gamma - ray bursts .    while the formation - process of supermassive black holes remains inconclusive , the birthplace of stellar mass black holes is most probably core - collapse supernovae of massive stars .",
    "evidence for kerr black holes as the energy source to high - energy astrophysical processes remains elusive , however .",
    "recent measurements on frame - dragging by x - ray spectroscopy , typically during inactive states of the black hole , are encouraging in this respect ( a.c .",
    "fabian , these proceedings ) .",
    "specically , we propose that grb - supernovae are powered by rapidly rotating black holes , wherein ( 1 ) the durations of long grbs of tens of seconds are identified with the lifetime of rapid spin of the black hole in a state of suspended accretion , ( 2 ) an accompanying supernova is radiation - driven by magnetic winds from a torus in suspended accretion , ( 3 ) ultrarelativistic outflows are launched by gravitational spin - orbit coupling with charged particles along open magnetic field - lines , and ( 4 ) a small branching ratio of type ib / c supernovae into grbs is attributed to the small probability of producing black holes with small kick velocities .",
    "modeling short grbs from slowly rotating black holes , we predicted x - ray afterglows very similar but weaker ( in total energies ) than those of long bursts . the recent discovery of faint x - ray afterglows to grb050509b and grb050709 fit well within this scheme .",
    "gamma - ray bursts present a potentially powerful link between rotating black holes and gravitational radiation .",
    "strategic searches for their chirps in binary coalescence of neutron stars and black holes , or long - duration bursts in gravitational radiation during radiative spin - down of a high - mass black hole , can be pursued by the advanced detectors ligo and virgo .",
    "strategic searches are preferrably pursued in combination with upcoming optical - radio supernova surveys , e.g. , pan - starrs in hawaii @xcite in combination with the low frequency array @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "in light of the proposed supernova - like signatures from the debris of a neutron star @xcite , these strategies might apply to both short and long bursts .",
