    "the ever expanding world of wireless communications has motivated the need for new techniques to improve the utilization of the radio spectrum and to increase the spectral efficiency .",
    "this has been partly achieved by the use of orthogonal channel access schemes in conventional half - duplex ( hd ) systems . in this case ,",
    "an hd wireless node transmits and receives information using orthogonal channels ( e.g. frequency , time ) for each operation .",
    "however , these orthogonality schemes lead to inefficient use of the system s bandwidth resources which in turn has prompted research for overcoming these limitations @xcite .",
    "a potential solution to the hd constraints is full - duplex ( fd ) radio , as it allows a wireless node to simultaneously transmit and receive information at the same time and frequency .",
    "the main drawback of fd is the loop interference ( li ) formed between the output and the input antennas which can be catastrophic to the system s efficiency and has been the primary reason why fd has been perceived as impractical so far . in spite of that , recent improvements in antenna technology and signal processing have helped mitigate this interference and , as a result , made fd feasible @xcite-@xcite .",
    "indeed , fd has gained popularity recently and the literature list regarding this area has expanded significantly ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in the context of wireless communication systems",
    ", fd has been studied mostly for simple topologies with a single user , and work for multiuser systems such as cellular and wifi networks has been limited . in such networks ,",
    "the simultaneous uplink and downlink operation at the same time and frequency creates multiuser interference which has a negative effect on the system s performance .",
    "the work in @xcite studies a three - node network with an fd base station and two hd mobile nodes and shows how a side - channel information can help reduce the effects of the interference from the uplink to the downlink node . in @xcite ,",
    "an fd capable network with a multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) base station serving multiple users is studied , where information theoretic interference management techniques achieve rate gains over an hd network .",
    "the network configuration of @xcite is also investigated in @xcite and it is shown that the network can also achieve rate gains by exploiting the degrees of freedom in a mimo base station .",
    "the aforementioned studies involve ` static ' small - scale scenarios in the sense that the distances between the nodes are not taken into account and they involve only one base station . to the authors knowledge ,",
    "` dynamic ' large - scale fd networks have only been studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite investigates a large - scale ad - hoc fd network and concludes that the large - scale factor in this case has a negative impact on the potential gains of the fd . on the other hand ,",
    "benefits of fd are demonstrated in @xcite , where a large - scale fd cellular network based on the three - node architecture is studied .",
    "tractable analytical expressions for the average per channel rate of both uplink and downlink are obtained using stochastic geometry , which show that the fd increases the aggregate throughput compared to the hd counterpart .",
    "even though the results of @xcite are promising for the fd prospects , further investigation should be undertaken in terms of the outage probability of the system .",
    "moreover , the two - node architecture , where both the base station and the user are fd capable , should also be taken into account . in this paper",
    ", we provide an analysis using stochastic geometry on the performance of the downlink in the two - node and the three - node fd architectures @xcite .",
    "the interference in each scenario acts differently on the downlink and so a comparison of the performances is provided together with the conventional hd one @xcite to show the points at which each scenario overtakes the others .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the next section sets forth the system model and its main assumptions .",
    "section [ sec : outage ] presents the analysis for the outage probability and section [ sec : validation ] presents a numerical validation and evaluation of the model . finally section [ sec : conclusion ] provides some conclusive remarks .    : @xmath0 denotes the @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space , @xmath2 denotes a two dimensional disk of radius @xmath3 centered at @xmath4 , @xmath5 denotes the euclidean norm of @xmath6 , @xmath7 represents the number of points in the area @xmath8 , @xmath9 denotes the probability of the event @xmath10 and @xmath11 represents the expected value of @xmath10 .    0.45     0.45",
    "we consider an fd - capable cellular network and focus on the downlink performance .",
    "we take into account two different scenarios where fd can be employed : a two - node and a three - node architecture @xcite .",
    "both scenarios are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scenarios ] where the active links are depicted with solid blue lines and the interference signals with dashed red lines . in the two - node fd scenario , both the base station ( bs ) and the user are fd capable and at any generic time a bs serves just one user for both uplink and downlink ( fig . [ fig : sce1 ] ) . in the three - node fd scenario , only the bs is fd capable and at any generic time a bs serves one hd uplink user and one hd downlink user ( fig . [",
    "fig : sce2 ] ) . as the main focus of this work is the performance of the downlink user",
    ", we assume that in both scenarios the bs operates fd in a similar way .",
    "both scenarios are modeled using spatial poisson point processes ( ppp ) @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the same notation is used for both models .",

    "similarly , let @xmath17 be a homogeneous ppp of the same density @xmath13 but independent of @xmath18 to represent the locations of the users .",
    "we assume that all the bss transmit with the same power @xmath19 and all the users with the same power @xmath20 ; both are equipped with a single transmit and a single receive antenna .",
    "we assume that the channels are subject to both small - scale fading and large - scale path loss .",
    "specifically , the fading between two nodes is rayleigh distributed and so the power of the channel fading is an exponential random variable with mean @xmath21 .",
    "the channel fadings are considered to be independent between them .",
    "the standard path loss model @xmath22 is used which assumes that the received power decays with the distance between the transmitter @xmath4 and the receiver @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the path loss exponent . throughout this paper",
    ", we will denote by @xmath25 and @xmath26 the path loss exponents for the channel between a bs and a user and for the channel between a pair of users respectively . in both scenarios ,",
    "the interference at the downlink user is the sum of the received signals from the bss of @xmath18 and the uplink users of @xmath17 , excluding the received signal from the bs in the same cell .",
    "note that in the two - node scenario the uplink and downlink operation is performed by the same user and so intra - cell interference does not exist .",
    "nevertheless , in this case the user experiences li .",
    "we assume that imperfect cancellation mechanisms of the li are used @xcite , @xcite and the channel gain @xmath27 from the residual interference after cancellation can be characterized by @xmath28=\\sigma_l^2 $ ] as each implementation of the cancellation mechanism can be characterized by a specific residual power @xcite .",
    "moreover , all wireless links exhibit additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with variance @xmath29 .",

    "the three - node fd performs the worst for which shows the major impact the intra - cell interference has on the downlink .",
    "indeed , the intra - cell interference starts to impact the performance at intermediate values , and as a result the outage converges faster than the other scenarios . on the other hand , the optimal two - node fd performs better than the three - node fd but its performance degrades as the residual li increases . since",

    "this behavior is expected and is due to the fact that the fd can achieve twice the achievable rate at any instant but due to the multiuser interference and li it achieves a better performance at higher target rates .",
    "indeed , it is obvious that the residual li has a critical impact on the performance since for the case @xmath101 the outage probability reaches 80% for @xmath102 bpcu .",
    "this is also clear from fig .",

    "[ fig : lambda ] .",
    "the main observation here is that the outage probability for the optimal two - node fd , the three - node fd and the hd scenarios is independent of @xmath13 .",
    "we can explain this behavior as follows .",
    "even though a larger ( smaller ) network density results to more ( less ) multiuser interference to the downlink user , it also entails that the user is closer ( further ) to its serving bs .",
    "this trade - off leads to the average performance to remain constant .",
    "however , when the user is subject to residual li in the two - node fd scenario , the outage does depend on @xmath13 and the denser the network , the lower the outage probability is . in this case",
    ", the residual li dominates the sinr at the downlink user so the denser the network , the closer the user is to the bs thus reducing the negative effects of the residual li .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] that the higher the power of the residual li is , the denser the network needs to be in order to achieve the performance of the three - node fd scenario .",
    "this paper has presented analytical expressions for the outage probability of two fundamental fd architectures in cellular networks : two - node and three - node . a detailed performance comparison has been provided between these two architectures and their hd counterpart .",
    "our results show that for low values of li residual the two - node performs better than the three - node due to the latter s high multiuser interference . on the other hand , for large values of residual li ,",
    "the three - node becomes more practical .",
    "as expected , the hd mode performs better than the fd mode for low threshold values @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , even though both fd architectures have potential gains , to achieve these the multiuser interference and li need to be reduced significantly .",
    "a future extension of this work is to consider the case where the nodes employ directional antennas which could reduce the multiuser interference and passively suppress the li , thus improving the performance of both architectures .",
