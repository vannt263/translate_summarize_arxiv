    "<S> using the fdtd method , we investigate the electromagnetic propagation in two - dimensional photonic crystals , formed by parallel air cylinders in a dielectric medium . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding frequency band structure is computed using the standard plane - wave expansion method . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that within partial bandgaps , waves tend to bend away from the forbidden directions . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon perhaps need not be explained in terms of negative refraction or ` superlensing ' behavior , contrast to what has been conjectured .    ever since the suggestion that a perfect lens can be realized by so called left handed materials ( lhms ) or negative refraction index materials ( nrims)@xcite , a conceptual material first introduced by veselago many years ago @xcite , the research on superlenses and lhms has been skyrocketing in the mist of much debate . </S>",
    "<S> a great body of literature has been and continues to be generated . </S>",
    "<S> the research ranges from finding characteristics of lhms , and negative refraction behavior ( nrb ) , to fabricating composite materials which may reveal as lhms . </S>",
    "<S> all this can be referred to in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in spite of some serious debates@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the common consensus seems to agree that the negative refraction , perhaps equivalently the lhms , has been confirmed@xcite .    up to date </S>",
    "<S> , there mainly three aspects regarding negative refraction ; this has caused some confusion to a certain degree . </S>",
    "<S> first , the concept of negative refraction was invented and specified with respect to lhms , as originally proposed by veselago@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for composite materials , the individual components may be positively refractive . </S>",
    "<S> but when put together , the materials as a whole may behave _ effectively _ as a negative refracting medium , and a negative refraction index can be defined@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second is to regard the refraction into the same side as the incident wave as negative refraction@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second aspect can be observed for waves across the boundary between an isotropic and an anisotropic medium , and this is in fact irrelevant to the negative refraction in its original sense@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the third aspect is to show negative refraction without employing or having to resort to an effective index of negative refraction .    in a recent communication , luo et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite described an all - angle negative refraction by photonic crystals , without negative effective index . by simulation </S>",
    "<S> , the authors demonstrated a frequency range so that for all incident angles one obtains a single negative - refracted beam . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that a slab of photonic crystal can focus a point source on one side of the slab into a _ real _ point image on the other side even for the case a parallel sided slab of materials , that is , the flat slab imaging . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon has been connected to the superlensing phenomenon discussed by veselago@xcite and pendry@xcite for a slab of lhms . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has stimulated a number of further experimental and theoretical attempts in verifying the negative refraction behavior of photonic crystals @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> two problems , however , may concern with the superlensing phenomenon and the negative refraction discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first question is whether the superlensing or the flat slab imaging can be explained by other mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the second question is whether there is indeed negative refraction as suggested . </S>",
    "<S> the first question has been answered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the imaging by a photonic crystal slab can be caused by partial bandgap effects or anisotropic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the answer to the second question , in our view , is not conclusive . in this communication , we wish to shed some light to the second question , in the hope that more discussions can be stimulated .    </S>",
    "<S> we will consider exactly the same two dimensional photonic crystal systems as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider a square lattice of identical air cylinders ( holes ) in a dielectric medium with dielectric constant @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice constant is denoted by @xmath1 and the hole radius @xmath2 . in accordance with ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we consider te modes , that is , the magnetic field is kept parallel to the axis of the air cylinders .    in order to compute the electromagnetic propagation through the arrays of air cylinders , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) simulations with perfectly matched layer ( pml ) boundary conditions . in the simulation , we scale all lengths by the lattice constant and the angular frequency by @xmath3 to make the system dimensionless .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we would like to duplicate the flat slab imaging observed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure of the system is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , in full agreement with the result in fig .  3 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    by the fdtd method </S>",
    "<S> , we have simulated the wave propagation across a flat ( 11)-oriented slab of lattice of air cylinders . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , the slabs of photonic crystals are all placed in air , in line with the ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric parameters are given in the figure caption . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) shows a snapshot of the magnetic field for a point source transmitting the continuous - wave of frequency 0.192 , which lies within the regime of so called all - angle negative refraction ( aanr)@xcite . note that we have also done with frequency 0.195 as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the results are qualitatively the same . here </S>",
    "<S> we indeed observe the formation of a ` point ' image on the right hand side of the slab , confirming the result depicted by fig .  4 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if such an imaging property can be attributed to the occurrence of the superlensing effect ( referring to the bottom paragraph on the second page of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , two wave propagation schemes can be identified . </S>",
    "<S> these are illustrated by fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) and ( d ) respectively . here , </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) shows the original sketch for the superlensing . </S>",
    "<S> the superlensing effect will not only focus a single image on the other side of the slab , but also another focused image within the slab . </S>",
    "<S> these two images must go hand in hand . </S>",
    "<S> the image inside the slab , however , is not obvious from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the imaging behavior has been misinterpreted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second possible scheme is described by fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is , a plane wave incident upon a slab of negative refraction structures will be negatively refracted inside the slab and recovers to its original travelling direction when returning to the outside medium which is positive refracting .    while the point source scheme has been discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , here we will concentrate on the second scheme , i.  e. fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> we wish to verify whether the negative refraction depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) or asserted in the right panel of fig .  2 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite actually occurs for the waves within the aanr regime , as suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . for the purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we consider electromagnetic propagation through much larger slabs and plot the waves inside the slabs with high resolution , again , by the standard fdtd method .    in fig .  2 </S>",
    "<S> , we plot the images of the magnetic intensity fields when a collimated plane wave , mimicked by the gaussian beam , is incident at various angles onto a slab of the above photonic crystals . </S>",
    "<S> although many incident angles have been taken into account , here we only show the results for four incident angles . </S>",
    "<S> the slab measures as 49.5x92 in terms of lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency is 0.192 , which is within the aanr range declared in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the flat slab is ( 11 ) oriented , as in the simulation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed information about the setup can be referred in the figure and the figure caption . </S>",
    "<S> here we see that no matter what angle the wave is incident onto the slab , the wave always tends to travel along the [ 11 ] direction of the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon has also been confirmed by plotting the snapshots of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the [ 11 ] direction , in which there is a passing band , serves as a main guiding channel for wave propagation , and an focused image can be formed across the slab . in the present case , </S>",
    "<S> the outgoing waves are more less parallel to the incident waves . here , however , we fail to observe the negative refraction expected for the superlens as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite or that depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also verify with other frequencies within the partial bandgaps , yielding similar results .    we have also investigated electromagnetic propagation through a slab of the photonic crystals with different orientations . </S>",
    "<S> as example , we show the case with the [ 11 ] direction being tilted leftward at 22.5 degree . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . here </S>",
    "<S> the flat slab has the same dimension as that in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the normal direction at the incident interface lies exactly in the middle of the [ 11 ] and [ 10 ] directions of the square lattice of the air cylinders . </S>",
    "<S> all the physical parameters are the same as in the above and in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we , again , observe that at any incident angle , the waves are more or less bent towards the [ 11 ] direction . in the case of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) , we also observed a secondary path along the direction perpendicular to the indicated [ 11 ] direction . </S>",
    "<S> this can be expected to be due to the symmetry of the square lattice .    to exclude the boundary of the slab as a possible cause for the bending </S>",
    "<S> , we have also performed simulations on various slab sizes . </S>",
    "<S> two examples are shown in fig .  4 : in ( a ) the slab height </S>",
    "<S> is increased , while in ( b ) the slab horizontal width is enlarged . </S>",
    "<S> the slab is ( 11 ) oriented . </S>",
    "<S> the plane wave is incident at the angle of 22.5 degree . here , the waves inside the slab travel along the [ 11 ] direction . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the results in figs .  2 and 4 , one can conclude that the wave deflection behavior inside the slab is not caused by the boundaries .    </S>",
    "<S> all the results shown above indicate that in certain ranges of frequencies , the photonic crystals can serve as a guiding medium that directs the wave diffraction or deflection . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the waves can be bent into a certain direction may allow for novel applications in controlling optical flows as suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one may ask for the reason for the discrepancies between the present results and the analysis of the superlensing phenomenon discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we would like to share our thoughts . </S>",
    "<S> the details will be published elsewhere@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the problem with the conjectured superlensing may lie in the approach to the energy flow inside the slab . </S>",
    "<S> the usual approach mainly relies on the curvatures of frequency bands to infer the energy flow .    as documented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , an energy velocity is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the energy flux and energy density of the eigenmodes , and the integration is performed in a unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that thus defined energy velocity equals the group velocity obtained as @xmath7 therefore it is common to calculate the group velocity to infer the energy velocity and subsequently the energy flows or refraction of waves . </S>",
    "<S> it has been discussed elsewhere@xcite , whether the net current flow through a unit cell really follows the direction of @xmath8 remains unclear . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that the average flux through a surface may be defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the unit normal vector of the surface @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the volume averaged current within a unit cell does not necessarily correspond to actual energy flows .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have used the standard fdtd method to simulate electromagnetic propagation across various flat slabs of photonic crystals . </S>",
    "<S> no negative refraction behavior has been discovered in the frequency regime thought to be the regime for all angle negative refraction . </S>",
    "<S> the present results , however , are consistent with the previous simulation on the flat slab imaging by the standard multiple scattering theory . </S>",
    "<S> although the present analysis has been focused on tm modes , it can be extended to te modes . </S>",
    "<S> some results of te modes have been reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the work received support from the national science council . </S>",
    "<S> some of the materials has been reported by one of us ( zy ) at the workshop on left - handed - materials and photonic crystals in ncu ( december 10 , 2003 ) and at the 5-th pacific rim conference on lasers and electro - optics in taipei ( december 15 - 19 , 2003 ) . </S>",
