    "hydrodynamic equations are a set of coupled partial differential equations for number density @xmath7 , energy density @xmath8 , pressure @xmath9 , hydrodynamic four - velocity @xmath10 , and dissipative fluxes such as bulk viscosity @xmath11 , heat current @xmath12 , and shear stress tensor @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the equation of state ( eos ) needs to be supplied .",
    "hydrodynamics is a powerful technique : given the initial conditions and the eos , it predicts the evolution of the matter .",
    "its limitation is that it is applicable at or near ( local ) thermal equilibrium only .",

    "it is used to calculate the multiplicity and transverse momentum spectra of hadrons , anisotropic flows and femtoscopic radii .",

    "hydrodynamics has traditionally been derived either from entropy considerations ( i.e. , the generalized second law of thermodynamics ) or by taking the second moment of the boltzmann equation ; for a review , see @xcite .",
    "the former approach captures a subset of the terms allowed by symmetry @xcite in the evolution equations for the dissipative quantities .",
    "the latter approach captures some more terms but not all .",
    "the question ` why do the traditional approaches not generate _ all _ the allowed terms ' , was the main motivation of our work @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we presented a new derivation of the dissipative hydrodynamic equations within kinetic theory but using a nonlocal collision term in the boltzmann equation .",
    "we obtained all the second - order terms that are allowed by symmetry @xcite and showed that the coefficients of the existing terms in the widely used traditional is equations were altered .",
    "these modifications do have a rather strong influence on the evolution of the viscous medium as we demonstrated in the case of one - dimensional scaling expansion .",
    "it is important to recall at the outset that an infinitesimal volume element in the fluid is always supposed to be large compared with the mean interparticle spacing and hence contains `` a very great '' number of particles @xcite ; see also fig .",
    "in kinetic theory , the single - particle phase - space distribution function @xmath20 is assumed to vary slowly over space - time , i.e. , it changes negligibly over the range of interparticle interaction @xcite , which in fact is much smaller than the mean interparticle spacing .",
    "it is important to keep this hierarchy of length scales in mind .",
    "it is also interesting to recall israel and stewart s classic paper @xcite where they list the properties of the collision term @xmath21 $ ] .",

    "( ii ) the form of @xmath21 $ ] is consistent with conservation of 4-momentum and number of particles at collisions .",
    "( iii ) @xmath21 $ ] yields a non - negative expression for the entropy production .... these requirements are of course met by boltzmann s ansatz for 2-particles collisions , and , indeed , one may hope that they hold somewhat more generally , although the locality assumption ( i ) is a powerful restriction . ''",
    "note the words _ hope _ and _ assumption_. the locality assumption is questionable and we relaxed it on the length scale of @xmath19 @xcite . despite the long history of the boltzmann equation , a collision term containing @xmath23 , to our knowledge , has never been used to derive hydrodynamic equations .",
    "such a collision term brings about a change not only in hydrodynamics but also in the kinetic theory .",
    "our starting point is the relativistic boltzmann equation with the modified collision term : @xmath24   =   c[f ] + \\partial_\\mu(a^\\mu f ) + \\partial_\\mu\\partial_\\nu(b^{\\mu\\nu}f ) + \\cdots,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on the type of the collisions ( @xmath27 ) .",

    "( [ coll ] ) refer to the gain and loss processes @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , occurring _ anywhere _ in the infinitesimal fluid element located at the space - time point @xmath17 .",
    "these processes have traditionally been assumed to occur at the same point @xmath17 with an underlying assumption that @xmath20 is constant not only over the range of interparticle interaction but also over the entire fluid element of size @xmath19 .",
    "boltzmann equation together with this crucial assumption has been used to derive the standard second - order dissipative hydrodynamic equations @xcite . we , however , emphasize that the variation of @xmath20 over the span of the fluid element may not be negligible , and hence the space - time points at which the above two kinds of processes occur should be separated by an interval @xmath37 within the volume @xmath38 ( fig . [ flel ] )",
