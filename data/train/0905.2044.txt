    "although we are constantly learning new things about our galaxy , some major questions about its structure still remain unanswered . among them",
    "is the composition of the galaxy halo . solving this mystery",
    "has been the main goal of the large photometric surveys launched in the 1990s .",
    "the proposal of @xcite has been realised by the surveys like macho @xcite , ogle @xcite , eros @xcite and moa @xcite .",
    "these groups continuously monitored millions of stars in both magellanic clouds in order to detect the transient amplification of brightness caused by objects crossing the observer  source line of sight in a phenomenon called gravitational microlensing @xcite .",
    "the rate of such events depends on the number , mass and kinematics of objects populating the line of sight , in the disk and the halo of our galaxy and in the clouds .",
    "the main hypothesis all the surveys have been testing is whether the halo of our galaxy contains dark matter in the form of the massive compact halo objects , called machos .",
    "if the galactic halo were entirely made of machos , with masses between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , in a project like ogle  ii we should detect about five microlensing events per year towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and the corresponding optical depth should be @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the actual optical depth measurements reported by the microlensing experiments are significantly smaller .    the macho collaboration presented a sample of 10 microlensing event candidates towards the lmc and concluded that the fraction of dark matter in machos @xmath7/@xmath8 20 per cent , suggesting the existence of a new , previously unknown population of objects with masses @xmath9 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "their estimate of the optical depth towards the lmc is @xmath10 .",
    "however , the eros group reported a null result and derived an upper limit on the optical depth due to machos of @xmath11 , which implies @xmath12 per cent ( @xcite ) .",
    "macho s sample of events is likely to have some contamination with variable stars , novae , and supernovae @xcite , and additional data indeed shows the presence of small contamination @xcite .",
    "however , the optical depth we quote from macho has been corrected for this contamination @xcite .",
    "the large discrepancy between the results may be due to the different samples of stars used by these groups or the fact that they probe different regions of the lmc .",
    "however , it is unclear whether these fully explain the discrepancy .",
    "independent searches for machos have also been carried out towards the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) using pixel - lensing method .",
    "for example , @xcite found 6 events and estimated the machos halo mass fraction to be higher than 20 per cent . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite presented an automatic procedure that selects unambiguous microlensing events in a pixel light curve data set with a total of only 3 `` gold - plated '' candidates , thus emphasizing the lack of large numbers of clear - cut microlensing events towards the m31 .",
    "@xcite showed 14 events towards m31 and noticed that the observed event rate is consistent with the self - lensing predictions , however their results were still inconclusive , mainly due to low statistics .",
    "in this paper we present the results of the search for microlensing events towards the large magellanic cloud in the independent data set gathered by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) in its second phase during the years from 1996 to 2000 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , the observational data are described along with the error bar correction procedure .",
    "next , the event search algorithm and its results are presented .",
    "it is followed by the description of the analysis of blending and its impact on the optical depth measurement and the event s detection efficiency .",
    "finally , the optical depth is calculated and the results are discussed .",
    "the data used in this paper were collected during the second phase of the ogle survey , in the years 1996  2000 towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the ogle project used its own dedicated warsaw telescope in the las campanas observatory , chile .",
    "details of the instrumentation for ogle  ii can be found in @xcite .    in brief , a 2k@xmath132k ccd with a pixel size of 0.417  arcsec was operated in the drift - scan mode , giving an actual size for each observed field of 2k@xmath138k .",
    "there were 21 fields observed towards the lmc covering a total of 4.72 square degrees .",
    "their locations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] .",

    ", we mean all objects having at least 80 epochs during the entire time span of the ogle  ii ( from about 15 to 25 per cent of all collected frames of a field ) and mean magnitude brighter than @xmath15 mag .",
    "the limiting magnitude was chosen to be at the peak of the observed luminosity function .",
    "the images in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands were de - biased and flat - field corrected `` on - the - fly '' .",
    "the photometric pipeline was based on the difference image analysis method ( dia , @xcite ) .",
    "photometric databases were created for both pass - bands as described in @xcite and are available on - line .    the ogle ",
    "ii observations of the lmc began in december 1996 ( hjd=2450446 ) , but during the first year only the very central fields ( i.e. those that are , in general , denser ) were observed ( fields 110 and 12 ) . in november 1997 ( hjd=2450726 ) , fields 11 and 1320 were added to the observing queue , and the addition of the field lmc_sc21 in january 1998 ( hjd=2450831 ) eventually formed the entire set of ogle  ii fields .",
    "all 21 fields were monitored continuously until november 2000 ( hjd=2451874 ) , yielding about 500 and 300 frames per field in the @xmath16 band for dense and sparse fields , respectively . in the @xmath17 band",
    ", there were no more than 50 frames per field collected in total during the duration of the project . on average , each field",
    "was observed every third night in the @xmath16 band , and every 11-th night in the @xmath17 band .",
    "mean seeing was 1.35 arcsec in the @xmath16 and 1.37 arcsec in @xmath17 .",
    "template images were created by stacking the best seeing images , resulting in images with seeing of about 1.1 arcsec .",
    "the template images contained about 5.5 million objects suitable for our study in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 band .",
    "the detection of microlensing events and the efficiency determination have been performed using @xmath14 band data only , as these were far more numerous and were sampled more frequently as compared to @xmath18band photometry .    in this study",
    "we also occasionally made use of ogle  iii lmc data from years 20012008 , which covered a much wider area and included the ogle  ii fields .",
    "details of the instrumentation and photometric pipeline can be found in @xcite .",
    "analysis of ogle  iii lmc data will be presented separately in a forthcoming paper ( wyrzykowski et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    additionally , for the two detected events",
    ", we also use the data gathered by the macho group and provided on their www interface .",
    "the reductions of the images and extraction of the photometry were performed with difference image analysis following @xcite .",

    "microlensing collaborations have deliberately chosen to monitor the densest fields on the sky , namely the galactic center and magellanic clouds .",

    "neglecting blending can have severe consequences on the optical depth measurements ( e.g.,@xcite ) , as the amplifications and time - scales of microlensing events may be determined incorrectly , sometimes by a factor of 2 or more . on the other hand , @xcite showed that in the case of the galactic bulge the effect of overestimation of the events time - scales cancels out with the underestimate of the real number of monitored stars to lowest order .    dealing with blending",
    "is a delicate and difficult task . adding a blending parameter to the standard microlensing light curve model may cause degeneracies in the parameter space of the microlensing events ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the favoured approach in recent optical depth determinations towards the galactic bulge and magellanic clouds is to neglect blending by narrowing the star sample to the brightest stars only ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the case of magellanic clouds the number of possible events is very small and it is even more unlikely to detect a microlensing event occurring in the limited number of bright stars .    in our analysis , we decided to use all stars available in the ogle  ii database . to deal with the blending issue  which is most serious for faint stars",
    " we make use of the archival images from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) located by chance in our fields .",
    "the hst images have superior resolution when compared to the ground - based ogle images ( i.e. they are nearly blending - free ) and are usually much deeper than the ogle data . therefore these data are a valueable source of information regarding the amount of blending . in the hst archive , we identified two deep acs @xmath16-band images coinciding with the ogle fields , located in ogle fields lmc_sc6 and lmc_sc19 , as typical representatives of the dense and sparse parts of the lmc .",
    "the location of these fields is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] .",
    "the positions of the hst stars were transformed onto the ogle images and then we identified which hst stars contributed to each ogle object by calculating their distances from the ogle blend s centre .",
    "a blend s radius was estimated using the gaussian profile for the given blend s magnitude at a chosen level above the background ( @xmath90 mag ) with an additional 1.3 pixel added in quadrature .",
    "we identified hst stars that were not more than 3.5  mag fainter than the ogle blend ( i.e.,@xmath91 per cent ) and considered stars located within the blend radius as components of that blend .",
    "this method allowed us to create an empirical distribution of the blending fractions for dense and sparse fields .",

    "even though the ogle template images , with respect to the typical images , have usually high resolution thanks to stacking of @xmath80a dozen of the best - seeing images , we still have limited ability to resolve individual stars . since each ogle template object may consist of several stars , any of which could be microlensed , the number of stars we consider as potential sources for microlensing events is actually larger than number of objects detected on the template image .    in order to estimate the actual number of monitored stars  which enters directly into eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] )  we derived the distributions of the number of hst stars hidden in a single ogle template object ( see fig .",

    "it is worth pointing out that in our method of counting the total number of monitored stars we did not count all stars that would be observed with the hst down to 23.9  mag ( 20.4 mag + 3.5 mag ) .",
    "we counted only those stars which were blended with other stars such that they formed a blend of magnitude brighter than 20.4  mag on the ogle template image .",
    "for instance , a single 21  mag star might not be detected on the template image .",
    "even if microlensed , we would not detect this event as in our analysis we did not search for transient events with no baseline ( i.e.,with no object on the template ) .",
    "if such star , however , was blended with another 21  mag star they would form a 20.2  mag object  very likely detectable on the template . in this case , both components would have blending factor of @xmath94 and both of them would be counted as a separate potential source for microlensing events .",
    "the task of calculating the detection efficiency for microlensing events can be a complicated procedure . in general , this requires us to simulate events and then determine the fraction that we recover with our selection criteria .",
    "it may seem that the most accurate method is to inject microlensing events into the series of real frames or to create completely new mock images and then put them through the entire photometric pipeline .",
    "however , this is obviously very intensive computationally .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear how to deal with the fact that any star within the blended object can be microlensed or whether the mock frame is indeed reproducing all characteristics of the real one .",

    "as shown in @xcite such an approach can be very successful when all factors are carefully taken into account .",
    "the detection efficiency was determined individually for the fields containing both events ( sc2 and sc8 ) . for a wide range of time - scales between 1 and 1000 days",
    ", we performed monte carlo simulation of about @xmath95 events . from the field s photometric database ,",
    "a star was picked randomly , provided that the star satisfied the basic cut 0 ( i.e.,it had the required number of data points and sufficient mean brightness ) . for a given @xmath84 ,",
    "the other microlensing parameters were drawn from flat distributions ( @xmath29 and @xmath36 ) and from the empirically derived distributions for the blending parameter ( @xmath62 ; see section [ sec : blending ] ) .",

    "the original flux of the input star was apportioned between the source and blend in the ratio @xmath96 .",

    ". our detection efficiency did not take into account the influence of binary lenses because monte carlo simulations of binary events and their automated recovery is a difficult and computationally demanding task . therefore we followed the approach adopted by the eros group @xcite and reduced the efficiency by a factor of 0.9 to compensate for the 10 per cent possible binary lenses .",

    "the large scatter in the bright range is due to low number statistics in the hst s small field - of - view ( as compared to ogle  ii fields ) .",
    "the broadening of the red clump may also be caused by this effect , or could be due to the distance gradient along the ogle field .",
    "the hst s lfs of dense and sparse areas differ significantly , which is likely caused by the different mix of lmc bar and disk populations in these two fields .    in our monte carlo simulations",
    ", we drew an object from the original ogle luminosity functions .",
    "therefore we were not affected by the incompleteness of the bright end of the hst luminosity functions .",
    "incompleteness in the faint end of the ogle luminosity functions is partially recovered in the correction process , but also is negligible as the sensitivity for such faint stars is very low .",

    "however , it provides a completely independent data set to test the hypotheses concerning the presence of machos in the galactic halo .",
    "based on two the events we found the optical depth towards the lmc to be @xmath121 . on one hand , this value is in 2-@xmath69 agreement with the @xmath122 obtained by macho @xcite .",
    "if both ogle  ii events were caused by machos , then they would contribute @xmath1 per cent to the total mass of the halo , according to model * _ s _ * from @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , our value of the optical depth is more consistent with a scenario of lensing due to the visible stellar lmc component alone ( self  lensing ) , for which various estimates of the optical depth are present in the literature : @xmath123 @xcite , @xmath124 @xcite , @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed theoretical study of the halo and self - lensing optical depth and compared it with the results of macho .",
    "they simulated the disk and bar of the lmc and quantitatively derived a contribution from the lmc s own stars to the optical depth as @xmath126 . in the region of the lmc bar , where most ogle - ii fields are concentrated , they estimated the self - lensing optical depth to vary between @xmath127 and @xmath88 .",
    "the optical depth derived for two events we found in the ogle - ii data and averaged over all fields is in a perfect agreement with these estimates .",
    "also the time - scales of our two events seem to belong to the regime of self  lensing , especially the 57.2-days event , which lies exactly on the line for the self  lensing events in fig .",
    "10 of @xcite . from the cmd of the lmc",
    ", it is apparent that both microlensed sources are coincident with an lmc population , indicating that they probably belong to the lmc .",
    "the locations of both events in the bar of the lmc also supports the self  lensing scenario .",
    "if we assume that our two events are indeed due to self  lensing ( i.e.,we have zero events caused by the halo objects ) , we can derive an estimate for the upper limit of the macho abundance in the halo of the milky way .",
    "we performed this analysis following the procedure similar to the one used by eros in @xcite , first estimating the number of expected events in the ogle  ii data set if the halo was entirely made of machos , using model * _ s _ * @xcite . in this model",
    "the optical depth towards the lmc equals @xmath128 , which also includes a contribution from self  lensing and galaxy disk lensing .",
    "dark matter lensing solely had @xmath129 .",
    "for a so - called ` typical ' mass of @xmath130 , in ogle  ii we should expect 16 events . at the 95 per cent poisson confidence level",
    "there are up to 3 events consistent with a zero detection .",
    "this divided by a number of expected events gives the upper limit on the mass fraction of about 19 per cent .",
    "this translates to an upper limit on the optical depth due to machos of @xmath131 .",
    "if blending is neglected in the all stars sample the numbers are somewhat larger : about 9 expected events would put a limit of @xmath132 .",
    "[ fig : nexp ] shows the dependence of the number of expected events on the mass of the lensing objects for the blended and non - blended approach .",
    "[ fig : upperlimit ] shows the 95 and 90 per cent confidence limits on the halo macho mass fraction for a wide range of masses .",
    "it also compares our results with the results from eros and macho .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the ogle  ii project is the most sensitive to events caused by machos with masses between 0.01 and 0.2 @xmath3 . for this range of masses",
    ", we can place an even tighter upper - limit of about 10 per cent ( at 95 per cent confidence ) on the abundance of compact dark matter objects in the galactic halo .",
    "a more detailed theoretical analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( calchi novati , mancini , scarpetta et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    for the sake of comparison with the results of the eros group , we also performed the above analysis narrowing the stars sample only to the bright stars . in each field , our bright sample consisted of about 20  30 per cent of stars present in all stars sample , with a total over all fields of about 1.9 million .",
    "after correction for blending , the number of monitored stars was about 3.6 million .",
    "in the bright sample of ogle  ii , we have not found any events . according to the full @xmath133 model of @xcite",
    ", we should expect about 9 events to be caused by lenses of mass @xmath134 , including events due to self  lensing .",
    "if we neglect blending , then we expect 6 events . the total optical depth towards the lmc is therefore estimated to be @xmath132 ( @xmath135 ) with ( without ) the full blending correction .",
    "the calculated upper - limit is very high due to the fact that ogle  ii has much smaller sky coverage and shorter time - baseline compared to the combined eros  i and eros  ii projects .",
    "however , a combined study of ogle  ii and ogle  iii data will be conducted in the near future and should be able to yield constraints of even stronger magnitude than those given by the eros collaboration ( @xcite , wyrzykowski et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "as has been discussed above , we did not have hst data for all ogle  ii fields .",
    "therefore we chose to use the two selected hst fields and consider these as being representative of two different density levels . in this way",
    "we recover only an approximation to the underlying real luminosity function for each field .    in order to check",
    "how our selection of hst stars affects the result , we repeated the whole analysis for a different cut on the hst stars magnitude , namely 2.5  mag ( instead of 3.5  mag ) below the brightness of the ogle objects .",
    "this translates to a minimal allowed blending fraction of 10 per cent .",
    "we then rederived the blending distributions and the distributions for the number of hst stars in a single ogle object .",
    "these distributions were obviously different compared to the original 3.5 mag cut ; for both sparse and dense fields , there was nearly no blending in the brightest magnitude bin . for the fainter stars , the distributions indicated a level of blending similar to that which was found previously , but with slightly less pronounced features for small @xmath62 .    in a similar manner to that described in section [ sec : blending ] , we estimated the total number of monitored stars and found about @xmath136 stars .",
    "then we also repeated the efficiency calculation including these new blending distributions .",
    "it was similar to the original efficiency to within 2 per cent .",
    "the detection efficiencies ( corrected for binary events ) for the two events were found to be @xmath137 and @xmath138 . since these efficiencies are similar to previous values while the number of monitored stars is reduced , we find that this yields a somewhat larger optical depth of @xmath139 .",
    "this is , however , still consistent with our original value , indicating little sensitivity of the optical depth on the depth of blending stars magnitude limit .    as an extreme case we also considered neglecting blending completely in our all stars sample . in this case",
    ", we find that there are only about 5.5 million sources with @xmath103 .",
    "the detection efficiency was obtained as described above and is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : eff ] .",
    "it was larger than in the case when blending is taken into account by about 20 per cent .",
    "however , this does not cancel out entirely with the reduction in the number of monitored sources . using these numbers with non - blended model time - scales ( table [ tab : models ] )",
    "leads to a larger value for the optical depth of @xmath140 , where we have used the detection efficiencies corrected for lack of binary events .",
    "this indicates that neglecting blending favours larger values of the optical depth , emphasising the importance of carrying out a careful analysis of blending when dealing with all stars samples in order to obtain reliable optical depth results towards the lmc .",
    "in the search for microlensing events in ogle  ii data towards the large magellanic cloud , we found two events .",
    "the total optical depth for all 21 ogle  ii lmc fields , covering about 4.5 square degrees , was derived for the all stars sample ( with a limit of @xmath141 mag ) as @xmath142 .",
    "if both events were caused by machos , this would imply that their comprise @xmath1 per cent of the halo by mass .",
    "however , the value of the optical depth and the characteristics of the events are consistent with the self  lensing scenario , in which lensing towards the lmc occurs only between sources and lenses both located in the cloud . from this",
    ", we can constrain the presence of compact dark matter objects in the milky way s halo and we find that our results are compatible with no detection .",
    "the upper limit is found to be 19 per cent for @xmath143 and 10 per cent for masses between 0.01 and 0.2 @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth emphasising that in our study we probed mainly the bar of the lmc , similarly to the macho project .",
    "however , our results and conclusions are closer to the ones of the eros collaboration , which probed different regions of the lmc .",
    "the sensitivity of the ogle  ii experiment is limited to a relatively short time span and sky coverage .",
    "however , the results presented in this paper will be soon strengthened and supplemented with the analysis of the 8-year ogle ",
    "iii data .",
