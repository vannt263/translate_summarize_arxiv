    "the metallicity of the hot x - ray emitting gas in ellipticals is a sensitive diagnostic of their supernova history and thus serves as a powerful discriminant for models of the enrichment of the hot gas ( e.g. loewenstein & mathews 1991 ; ciotti et al .",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ studies have found the metallicities of ellipticals to be very sub - solar in contradiction to the standard enrichment models ( e.g. sarazin 1997 ) .",
    "this discrepancy has led some authors @xcite to question the reliability of the standard plasma codes , in particular their modeling of the fe - l emission lines .",
    "however , the abundances derived from the plasma codes also depend on the temperature structure of the gas . because the cooling times are short ( @xmath11 yr ) in ellipticals ( e.g. thomas et al .",
    "1986 ) the hot gas in elliptical galaxies may consist of a continuum of hot and cold phases similar to that expected for galaxy clusters ( nulsen 1986 ; thomas , fabian , & nulsen 1987 ) .",
    "fitting single - temperature models to intrinsically two - temperature spectra can result in a significant underestimate of the metallicity @xcite .",
    "matsumoto et al . have obtained very sub - solar abundances from fitting two - component models to _ asca _ sis and gis data of a sample of 12 ellipticals , but they restricted the form of the high - temperature component to have the same temperature for each galaxy .",
    "that is , matsumoto et al .",
    "combined the data at high energies , @xmath12 kev , for the 12 galaxies and found that the composite spectrum is not tightly constrained but equally well described by either a thermal bremsstrahlung model with @xmath13 kev or a power - law model with photon index 1.8 .",
    "these models , which are thought to describe the emission from discrete sources , are then assumed to be similar for every galaxy and to apply over the full _ asca _ energy band , @xmath14 kev . however , these models need not be valid representations for every galaxy , especially for energies below 4 kev where they are only extrapolations .",
    "hence , there is a need for a study of a larger sample of ellipticals with fewer modeling assumptions .",
    "moreover , the calibration status of _ asca _ has changed significantly over the past year and thus the results of previous studies need to be verified .",
    "we have assembled a sample of 20 early - type galaxies ( 17 e , 3 s0  see table [ tab.prop ] ) with high @xmath0 values as listed in kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri to insure that the x - ray emission is mostly due to hot gas .",
    "these galaxies have archival _ asca _ observations of good quality for most of the sample .",
    "we place a premium on the signal - to - noise ratio , s / n , and thus the extraction radii for the spectra are in many cases smaller than in previous studies . this attention to s / n is vital in order to achieve the global @xmath15 minima with xspec for our models with many fitting parameters .",
    "we fit as many temperature components as are demanded by the data to achieve a good fit without any restrictions on the temperatures .",
    "we also examine the reliability of the plasma codes in the fe - l spectral band directly from the sample .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in  [ obs ] we describe the details of the observations and data analysis .",
    "the results of the single - temperature fits and the empirical test of the plasma codes is given in  [ 1 t ] .",
    "we discuss the two - temperature ( and three - temperature ) fits in  [ 2 t ] . in ",
    "[ nh ] we discuss the evidence and implications for excess absorption in several of the galaxies .",
    "finally , we summarize and give our conclusions in  [ conc ] .",
    ".sis vs gis [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) luminosities of the cold component @xmath16 and the hot component @xmath17 in erg s@xmath18 corresponding to the two - temperature models of table [ tab.2 t ] .",
    "we used the distances from faber et al .",
    "as reported in eskridge , fabbiano , & kim for @xmath19 km / s / mpc .    in table",
    "[ tab.lum ] we give the unabsorbed luminosities of the cold and hot components obtained from the fits of the two mekal models to the galaxy spectra as well as the ratio of total x - ray luminosity , @xmath20 , to @xmath21 .",
    "( we give only the best - fit values of @xmath22 since the statistical uncertainties are less than a few percent .",
    "the statistical errors on the relative contribution of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are very nearly those of @xmath25 in table [ tab.2 t ] . ) because of our procedure of maximizing the s / n of the extraction radii (  [ obs ] ) our luminosities tend to be somewhat smaller than found in previous studies which is most significant for galaxies having the lowest s / n observations .",
    "however , the 0.5 - 5 kev fluxes determined in this paper differ by @xmath26 for the corresponding galaxies studied by other authors using larger aperture sizes ( awaki et al . 1994 ; matsushita et al . 1994 ; loewenstein et al .",
    "1994 ; buote & canizares 1997 ; arimoto et al .",
    "1997 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ) , and thus the luminosities in table [ tab.lum ] are close to the total values .",
    "we plot the total x - ray luminosity versus @xmath21 in figure [ fig.lx ] .",
    "as expected for the relatively high @xmath0 galaxies in our sample @xcite , the slope is quite steep , @xmath27 , and is consistent with that predicted from steady - state cooling flow models ( nulsen et al .",
    "1984 ; sarazin 1997 ) .",
    "although our sample is too small to make a definitive statement , the slope appears to steepen for larger @xmath22 and @xmath21 .",
    "these galaxies include ngc 1399 , ngc 5044 , and ngc 5846 for which significant emission may be due to a diffuse intergroup medium .",
    "also in figure [ fig.lx ] we plot the emission from the soft and hard components separately .",
    "we take the emission of the soft components to be given by those of the cold component with temperature @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 kev then we add that emission to the soft component as well .",
    "the hard components are those having @xmath8 kev .",
    "the slope of the soft emission appears to be slightly steeper than that of the total x - ray emission for the galaxies with smaller @xmath22 .",
    "we can not distinguish the slopes of the soft and hard components ( though the galaxies with measured hard components do not extend to the highest @xmath22 in our sample ) , but the hard component does appear to flatten somewhat at the largest @xmath21 .    in any event , the slope for the hard emission is still considerably steeper than 1 which indicates for the galaxies in our sample the hard components are not entirely associated with discrete sources .",
    "it is likely that with higher s / n data the temperatures of many of these hard components will be split into subcomponents some of which will have smaller temperatures consistent with emission from hot gas .    as argued in previous studies of large samples of ellipticals with the _ einstein observatory _",
    "( canizares et al . 1987",
    "; kim et al . 1992 ) the ratio @xmath0 is a good indicator of when the x - ray emission is dominated by hot gas ( larger values ) or by discrete sources ( smaller values ) . in figure [ fig.lxlb ]",
    "we plot the ratio of the luminosity of the cold component to the hot component , @xmath30 , versus @xmath0 .",
    "galaxies which have @xmath29 kev are not plotted since they have no measured component presumably due to discrete sources , but would appear somewhere in the top right of the plot .",
    "we see an increase of @xmath30 with @xmath0 as expected , albeit with large scatter , and a slope slightly less than 1 .",
    "hence , from direct measurement of the ratio @xmath31 we have shown that as @xmath0 increases the proportion of the total emission due to hot gas with respect to that of a hard component presumably due to discrete sources increases such that @xmath32 .",
    "interestingly , for a general slope @xmath33 this relation implies that when @xmath34 we have @xmath35 which is consistent with expectations of a discrete component where @xmath36 .",
    "finally , we plot the temperature of the soft component versus total x - ray luminosity in figure [ fig.lxtx ] .",
    "this temperature is taken to be @xmath28 unless @xmath29 kev in which case it is set to the emission - weighted value of @xmath28 and @xmath37 . over the decade in luminosity @xmath38 erg @xmath39 s@xmath18 we see the expected rise of temperature of the hot gas with total x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , the trend disappears into scatter for larger @xmath22 .",
    "for example , ngc 7619 and ngc 7626 have low @xmath28 for their x - ray luminosity .",
    "but they also have @xmath40 kev and thus their hot - gas temperatures may in fact be higher in reality .",
    "another explanation is given by cooling flows .",
    "we infer mass deposition rates of @xmath41 yr@xmath18 for galaxies ngc 499 , ngc 4636 , ngc 7619 , ngc 7626 , and ic 4296 which appear to have low soft temperatures for their x - ray luminosity .",
    "hence , as in clusters of galaxies @xcite , the presence of cooling flows may account for much of the scatter in the @xmath42 relationship .",
    "for approximately half the galaxies in our sample the spectral fits are significantly improved when allowing for absorption in excess of the galactic value .",
    "this effect is most clearly illustrated for the galaxies where the cooling - flow model provides a substantially better fit than a single mekal ( or raymond - smith ) model ( see  [ 1 t ] ) . in figure [ fig.nh ]",
    "we display the sis0 spectrum of ngc 1399 and the best - fit cooling - flow model obtained from jointly fitting the sis0 and sis1 data of the two available observations ( see table [ obs ] ) .",
    "when fixing @xmath43 to the galactic value the best - fit model predicts more emission than observed for energies @xmath44 kev : @xmath45 for 257 dof giving @xmath46 .",
    "these residuals around 0.8 kev can not be eliminated by including another thermal component . however ,",
    "if the absorbing column is allowed to be a free parameter then these residuals can be largely removed : @xmath47 for 256 dof giving @xmath48 .",
    "the resulting column density , @xmath49 @xmath39 , is over ten times the galactic value of @xmath50 @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "is this excess absorption an instrumental effect peculiar to _ asca _ ? as explained in ",
    "[ 1 t ] , most previous _",
    "studies do not find evidence for excess absorption in early - type galaxies .",
    "this discrepancy between the spectral shape of _ rosat _ and _ asca _ below 1 kev has been observed , e.g. for the bright seyfert galaxies mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite and ngc 5548 @xcite as well as the classic qso 3c273 @xcite .",
    "however , a recent analysis of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 by orr et al .",
    "finds that the @xmath51 kev spectrum observed by beppo - sax @xcite agrees extremely well with that of the _ asca _ sis .",
    "similar agreement between beppo - sax and _ asca _ has also been reported for 3c273 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from a simultaneous _ rosat _ pspc and asca observation of the seyfert galaxy ngc 5548 @xcite it has been found that the absorption determined from _ asca _ agrees with determinations from ginga unlike the determination from _",
    "rosat_. given the agreement between the spectra of _ asca _ , _ sax _ , and _ ginga _ it would appear that the excess absorption measured by _",
    "asca _ is not the result of an instrumental effect .",
    "we do note that the excess column density reported here , if due to a uniform screen of the galaxy , precludes any emission being detected in the carbon band of _ rosat_. of course , the excess absorption is likely to be distributed throughout the emitting gas , and the nearest unabsorbed parts of the galaxy will give detectable radiation in that band .",
    "( see allen & fabian for simulations of this effect for clusters of galaxies . )",
    "we mention that rangarajan et al .",
    "did find excess absorption for ngc 1399 by exploiting the spatial information provided by the _",
    "rosat _ pspc . by comparing the ratios of the spectrum of the inner region ( @xmath52 kpc ) to a best - fit unabsorbed thermal model with the corresponding ratio of the spectrum of an outer annulus ( @xmath53 kpc ) to its best - fit unabsorbed thermal model they clearly showed the diminution of photons with energies @xmath54 kev in the inner region",
    "( see their figure 5 ) .",
    "however , consistent with the general _ asca_-_rosat _ discrepancy stated above , excess absorption is not required when fitting absorbed ( single - component ) thermal models to the data @xcite .",
    "the excess @xmath43 we have derived from the spectral fits is only the simplest result assuming a uniform absorber which reduces the x - ray emission according to an exponential form depending only on the energy . in this approximation",
    "the excess columns @xmath55 @xmath39 imply masses in atomic hydrogen , @xmath56 , when spread uniformly over a 10 kpc radius .",
    "this level of absorber mass is very similar to the typical mass of the hot x - ray emitting gas in early - type galaxies , but @xmath57 is typically a factor of 10 larger than the mass inferred from hi observations ( e.g. bregman , roberts , & giovanelli 1988 ; bregman & roberts 1990 ) .",
    "similar disagreement is found for an absorption feature in the field of ngc 4472 by irwin & sarazin .",
    "however , these discrepancies with hi observations may be irrelevant since the absorber could be composed of molecular gas ( e.g. ferland , fabian , & johnstone 1994 ) .",
    "the mass of molecular gas can be measured with co observations , but is typically factors of a few smaller than expected under the above simple assumptions ( e.g. irwin et al .",
    "however , excess absorbing mass above that predicted by the standard co/@xmath58 conversion has been reported from 158 micron observations of the irregular galaxy ic 10 @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the uniform absorber model is certainly over - simplified and , e.g. a partial covering fraction and metallicity dependence could very well be required .",
    "the cold gas implied by the excess absorption is a natural consequence of the multi - phase cooling - flow scenario ( nulsen 1986 ; thomas et al .",
    "1987 ; white & sarazin 1987 ) wherein mass drops out of the flow at all radii where the cooling time is less than the age of the galaxy ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "in particular , for clusters of galaxies allen & fabian have demonstrated using color profiles of _ rosat _ pspc data that clusters with @xmath60 have intrinsic absorbing material which is preferentially distributed in the core and of a quantity that is consistent with the amount of mass deposited by the cooling flow over @xmath59 .    although the situation in early - type galaxies is likely complicated to some extent by heat sources , the success of the simple cooling - flow model over the single mekal model for the brightest galaxies and the associated required excess absorption ( see  [ 1 t ] ) suggests that multi - phase cooling flows are operating in these galaxies .",
    "this is further supported by the fact that these galaxies when fitted with two - temperatures indicate that they have a multi - phase medium ( see  [ 2 t ] ) ; i.e. one component may represent the hot ambient phase and the other the emission from the distributed mass drop - out component . in this scenario ,",
    "the drop - out term should consist of a continuum of phases which will become evident when probed by detectors with better spectral resolution .",
    "we present spectral analysis of _ asca _ data of 20 bright , mostly high @xmath0 , early - type galaxies ( 17 e , 3 s0 ) which is the largest sample of its kind reported to date . fitting a single , absorbed , thin thermal model ( mekal or raymond - smith ) to",
    "the spectra fails to provide acceptable fits ( e.g. @xmath61 ) for 14 galaxies .",
    "excess absorption significantly improves the fits for 10 of the galaxies .",
    "the abundances of the single - temperature models are very sub - solar , @xmath62 @xmath3 , in agreement with those reported by previous _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ studies .",
    "fitting instead an absorbed cooling - flow model yields fits of comparable quality to the mekal model for 11 galaxies but is a significantly better fit for the other 9 .",
    "the improvement in the fits is dramatic for ngc 4472 , ngc 5044 , and ic 4296 .",
    "the abundances obtained from the cooling - flow model , @xmath63 @xmath3 , significantly exceed those obtained with the mekal and raymond - smith models .",
    "we empirically tested the reliability of the mekal and raymond - smith plasma codes in the fe - l band . in order to lessen the influence of other temperature components we restricted our analysis to 0.5 - 2 kev and performed fits over only the fe - l band ( taken to be 0.7 - 1.2 kev ) and over the band excluding fe - l ( 0.5 - 0.7 and 1.2 - 2 kev ) .",
    "we did not find large systematic trends expected if the plasma codes predict too much or too little fe - l emission for a given temperature and metallicity .",
    "however , unlike the mekal model , the raymond - smith model did give some evidence for these systematic trends which , as expected , indicates that the fe - l region of raymond - smith is not as well modeled as with mekal .",
    "( the reasonable agreement of the abundances obtained by mekal and raymond - smith shows that such errors are not catastrophic . )    fitting two - temperature models ( with mekal or raymond - smith models ) significantly improved the quality of the fit in 16 out of 20 galaxies and gave formally acceptable values of @xmath5 .",
    "( we found that care needed to be exercised with xspec to achieve the global @xmath15 minima for the lowest s / n galaxies in the sample . )",
    "the galaxies having the highest s / n spectra in our sample ( which coincidentally have the largest @xmath0 ) generally have a temperature for the cold component , @xmath64 kev , and for the hot component , @xmath65 kev ; i.e. both components are consistent with emission from hot gas .",
    "we have examined such line ratios and find that the line ratios of the single - temperature models in  [ 1 t ] are very similar to those of the two - temperature models in  [ 2 t ] ( i.e. within @xmath66 ) .",
    "however , caution must be exercised when computing these line ratios directly from the data because of the calibration errors due to the optical constants in the mirror around 2 kev @xcite .",
    "since the key h - like si line appears at 2.0 kev , and for all of the galaxies in our sample this line is very noisy ( e.g. figure [ fig.nh ] ) , and its intensity depends sensitively on the assumed continuum , we believe that any reliable constraints on the 2.0 kev h - like si line must await corrected response matrices . ] .",
    "the lower s / n galaxies ( which coincidentally have the smallest @xmath0 ) typically have @xmath64 kev but @xmath8 kev .",
    "the temperature of this hot component is consistent with emission from discrete sources .",
    "the flux of this hot component is generally smaller than that of the cold component .    in stark contrast to the single - temperature models , the abundances obtained from the two - temperature fits are approximately solar ; @xmath10 @xmath3 for two mekal models and @xmath67 @xmath3 for two raymond - smith models .",
    "the difference between the abundances determined from single - temperature and two - temperature models is not due to increased errors on the parameters but is an artifact of fitting intrinsically multi - temperature spectra with single - temperature models @xcite .",
    "our abundances disagree with the two - component models fit to _ asca _ spectra of several of the galaxies in our sample by matsumoto et al . .",
    "we attribute the discrepancy to the different modeling procedures used and to the higher s / n data in our study owing to generally smaller extraction radii for the spectra .",
    "possible abundance gradients do not account for the discrepancy because we obtain approximately solar abundances even for some of the large s / n galaxies in our sample which have large extraction radii ( e.g. ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 ) .",
    "the approximately solar abundances we find are consistent with multi - phase models for the evolution of the hot gas in ellipticals ( e.g. fujita et al . 1997 ) .",
    "however , though considerably larger than obtained in previous studies , these nearly solar abundances are still substantially less than the super - solar abundances predicted by the standard enrichment theories ( e.g. ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ; also see arimoto et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "two - component models where one component is a cooling - flow model and the other a mekal give fits of comparable quality to fits of two mekal models . since the flux is shared by the two components , the inferred mass deposition rates are smaller than when only a cooling - flow model is fit to the spectra .",
    "it should be emphasized that a radial temperature gradient in a single - phase gas unlikely accounts for the temperatures seen in the large @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "for example , ngc 4472 has roughly an equal contribution from phases with temperatures @xmath68 kev and @xmath69 kev , but the temperature profile measured with the _ rosat _ pspc varies from only @xmath70 kev over @xmath71 @xcite . a plausible physical explanation of the two phases is offered by a multi - phase cooling flow ( nulsen 1986 ; thomas et al .",
    "1987 ; white & sarazin 1987 ) where one component represents the hot ambient phase and the other represents the emission from the distributed mass drop - out component . in this scenario ,",
    "the drop - out term should consist of a continuum of phases which should become evident when probed by detectors with better spectral resolution .",
    "we compared @xmath21 to the luminosities of the hot and cold components determined by fits of two mekal models .",
    "both the luminosities of the soft and hard components increase with @xmath21 with a slope approximately 2 , although there is some weak evidence that the cold component has a steeper slope than the hot component . for galaxies with @xmath8 kev",
    "we find that @xmath72 ; i.e. there is a clear increase in the ratio of the luminosity of the cold component to the hot component as a function of @xmath0 indicating that @xmath0 is indeed a good indicator for the relative contribution of hot gas and discrete sources to the total x - ray emission .",
    "( a recent study of ngc 3923 by buote & canizares ( 1998 ) finds that the allowed contribution to the _ rosat _ x - ray emission from a population of discrete sources with @xmath73 is significantly less than indicated by @xmath74 measured in this paper if we associate @xmath75 .",
    "this would support the conjecture that a significant fraction of the hard components measured for the low s / n galaxies is due to other phases in the hot gas . )    therefore , our investigation shows that the very sub - solar abundances obtained in previous studies are not the result of failures in the plasma codes ( as proposed by arimoto et al .",
    "rather , fitting multi - temperature models , without restricting the form of the models to a universal model for discrete sources , and setting extraction radii so that s /",
    "n is maximized , gives metal abundances near solar for both mekal and raymond - smith models .",
    "moreover , fits to the x - ray spectra of half of the galaxies in our sample are significantly improved when allowing for absorption in excess of the galactic value .",
    "accurate determination of the spatial distributions of the absorbing components and the various phases of the hot gas must await better quality data as must determination of the nature of the hard components found in the lower s / n galaxies in our sample .",
    "the next generation of x - ray satellites soon to be flown will have the capabilities to make significant progress in these areas .",

    "<S> we present spectral analysis of _ asca _ data of 17 elliptical and 3 lenticular galaxies most of which have high @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> single - temperature models ( mekal and raymond - smith ) give unacceptable fits @xmath1 in most cases and , in agreement with previous studies , give very sub - solar abundances , @xmath2 @xmath3 ( mekal ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra for approximately half the sample are better fit with a cooling - flow model which in three cases gives a substantially better fit . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances derived from the cooling - flow model are also significantly larger , @xmath4 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we empirically tested the reliability of the plasma codes in the fe - l region and found no evidence for serious problems with the determined temperatures and abundances .    </S>",
    "<S> two - temperature models give substantially better fits that are formally acceptable ( @xmath5 ) in all but a few cases . </S>",
    "<S> the highest s / n galaxies ( which also have highest @xmath6 ) have fitted temperatures @xmath7 kev for both components consistent with each being distinct phases of hot gas . the lowest s / n galaxies ( which also have lowest @xmath0 ) generally have a hot component with temperature , @xmath8 kev , which is consistent with emission from discrete sources . </S>",
    "<S> ( we discuss the origin of these two components from analysis of @xmath9 and @xmath0 . ) the abundances of these two - temperature models are approximately solar , @xmath10 @xmath3 ( mekal ) , consistent with a recent multi - phase model for the evolution of hot gas in ellipticals . finally , for several galaxies </S>",
