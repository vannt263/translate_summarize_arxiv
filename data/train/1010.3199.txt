    "in the supernova ( sn ) taxonomy , type ib supernovae ( snib ) are defined as the subclass of core - collapse explosions ( cc - sne ) whose early - time spectra are characterized by strong hei lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "cc - sne are thought to descend from massive progenitors ( m  @xmath5 ) and include also the most frequent , h - dominated type ii sne ( snii ) as well as type ic sne ( snic ) , which appear deprived of both h and he .",
    "the physical connection among these subtypes is provided by their location almost exclusively in spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , in particular , by their association to massive star formation regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an additional evidence of a link between the different subtypes of ccsne came with the discovery of objects , called type iib , that metamorphose from type ii at early stages to type ib later on .",
    "the prototype of this subclass is in m81 , one of the best studied sne at all wavelengths ever ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while early time spectra of cc - sne can be very different as a consequence of the different configurations of the progenitors at the moment of their explosions , late time spectra of all cc - sne are consistently similar with strong emission lines of neutral and singly ionized o and ca , in addition to h balmer lines for snii .",
    "the standard scenario is that snib descend from massive stars that have lost their h envelope through strong winds or mass transfer to a companion @xcite .",
    "if in addition to the h also the he envelope has been removed , then the sn will appear of type ic .",
    "for this reason snib , ic and iib are often referred to as stripped envelope ( se ) sne .    with the improved quality of data ,",
    "the differences between type ib and ic have shown to be subtle , and classifications often controversial .",
    "for instance , in sn  1994i , early on considered as the prototypical snic , has been found possible signature of he @xcite ; the type ib was characterized by weak optical hei but strong hei 10830 , 20581 lines in the near - ir @xcite ; the peculiar sn  2005bf @xcite and sn 2008d @xcite underwent a metamorphosis from a broad line type ic at early times to a typical type ib at later epochs .",
    "the sharp distinction between the two classes seems therefore to be replaced by a continuity of properties in he abundances and/or excitation .",
    "the study of stripped - envelope snib / c has received fresh impetus in the past decade because of the association of some of them , in particular the most energetic snic ( hypernovae ) , with grbs of long duration @xcite .",
    "more recently a few snic have been associated with less energetic x - ray flashes @xcite .",
    "an x - ray flash was also detected in the type ib , which was attributed either to shock break - out at the star surface @xcite or to the effect of mildly relativistic jets due to the collapse of a 30 star to a black hole @xcite .    despite this renewed interest the objects with detailed observations",
    "remain few .",
    "in particular , it is not well ascertained if snib do exist as a distinct class or if there is a uniform distribution of objects from snii to snic with decreasing h ( and he ) content in the outer layers . in this context , is interesting because it has been adopted several times in the past to describe the average properties of snib ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
