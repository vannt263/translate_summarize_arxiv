    "indeed , the spin - orbit effect is known to lift the inversion symmetry constraint , allowing the superconducting gap to possess both singlet and triplet components.@xcite additionally , breaking time - reversal symmetry will destroy kramers degeneracy and allows that the majorana modes appear unpaired.@xcite thus , the combination of strong spin - orbit plus zeeman effects in a conventional superconductor in the right parameter regime implements an effective topological superconductor hosting majorana modes at its ends.@xcite in practice , the superconductivity is induced by proximity effect to a strong spin - orbit semiconducting wire , whereas the zeeman effect is induced by applying a magnetic field along the wire.@xcite    to simplify the calculations , we start with the simplest model exhibiting majorana modes : a spinless @xmath3-wave superconducting wire .",

    "<S> distinct majorana modes obey the fermionic anticommutation relations @xmath1.@xcite since they break the u(1 ) symmetry of electric charge conservation down to @xmath2 , it is natural to search for them emerging in superconducting systems where they appear as boundary states in chiral @xmath3-wave nanowires.@xcite even so there is no occupation operator associated with a single majorana mode due to the fact that @xmath4 , two majorana modes can be combined to a single conventional fermionic mode @xmath5 with the corresponding number operator @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact in turn indicates that in electronic systems emergent majorana modes will always appear in pairs . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , a situation is possible where the two majorana modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 belonging to a single fermionic mode @xmath9 are spatially separated from each other ( unpaired ) , more precisely they are totally delocalized at the two ends of a superconducting nanowire . </S>",
    "<S> these two delocalized modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 when taken together represent a fermionic mode at zero energy which encodes the parity of the total number of fermions in the system . because the fermion parity is a conserved quantity for an isolated superconductor , a quantum state encoded in a wire hosting majorana modes is in principle immune to decoherence and thus serves as an interesting implementation of a quantum memory . on the other hand , if the superconductor exchanges ( quasi-)particles with its environment , e.g. , when in proximity to a gapless metal , the parity is not conserved and there is no topological protection of the memory , see , e.g. , refs .  .    </S>",

    "<S> if a perturbation is strong enough to excite one of the localized zero - energy mode ( say @xmath7 for instance ) into an excited quasi - particle above the energy gap , the sign of the corresponding majorana mode flips resulting in a qubit sign - error .    to overcome this problem , akhmerov recently proposed a non - local qubit encoding , hereafter called a macro - majorana encoding , which is in principle robust to local excitations.@xcite the robustness originates from the localization of the excitations in a portion of space containing one of the unpaired majorana modes ( see fig .
