    "lifetime distribution represents an attempt to describe , mathematically , the length of the life of a system or a device .",
    "lifetime distributions are most frequently used in the fields like medicine , engineering etc .",
    "many parametric models such as exponential , gamma , weibull have been frequently used in statistical literature to analyze lifetime data .",
    "but there is no clear motivation for the gamma and weibull distributions .",
    "they only have more general mathematical closed form than the exponential distribution with one additional parameter .",
    "+ recently , one parameter lindley distribution has attracted the researchers for its use in modelling lifetime data , and it has been observed in several papers that this distribution has performed excellently .",
    "the lindley distribution was originally proposed by lindley @xcite in the context of bayesian statistics , as a counter example of fudicial statistics which can be seen that as a mixture of exp(@xmath0 ) and gamma(2 , @xmath0 ) .",
    "more details on the lindley distribution can be found in ghitany et al .",
    "+ a random variable x is said to have lindley distribution with parameter @xmath0 if its probability density function is defined as : + @xmath1 with cumulative distribution function @xmath2 some of the advances in the literature of lindley distribution are given by ghitany et al .",
    "@xcite who has introduced a two - parameter weighted lindley distribution and has pointed that lindley distribution is particularly useful in modelling biological data from mortality studies .",
    "mahmoudi et .",
    "@xcite have proposed generalized poisson lindley distribution .",
    "bakouch et al .",
    "@xcite have come up with extended lindley ( el ) distribution , adamidis and loukas @xcite have introduced exponential geometric ( eg ) distribution .",
    "shanker et .",
    "@xcite have introduced a two - parameter lindley distribution .",
    "zakerzadeh et al.@xcite have proposed a new two parameter lifetime distribution : model and properties .",
    "hassan @xcite has introduced convolution of lindley distribution .",
    "ghitany et al.@xcite worked on the estimation of the reliability of a stress - strength system from power lindley distribution .",
    "elbatal et al.@xcite has proposed a new generalized lindley distribution .",
    "+ risti @xcite has introduced a new family of distributions with survival function given by @xmath3    in this paper we introduce a new family of distribution generated by a random variable @xmath4 which follows one parameter lindley distribution .",
    "the survival function of this new family is given as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a cumulative distribution function(cdf ) which we use to generate a new distribution .",
    "the cdf @xmath8 is referred to as a transformer and the corresponding probability density function ( pdf ) is given by @xmath9 we consider the transformer to follow exponential distribution with cdf @xmath10 .",
    "hence the survival function of the new distribution is given by @xmath11 with corresponding density given by @xmath12 we refer the random variable with survival function ( 4 ) as lindley - exponential(l - e ) distribution with parameters @xmath0 and @xmath13 which we denote by l - e(@xmath14 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the mathematical properties of the l - e distribution and to illustrate its applicability .",
    "the contents are organized as follows .",
    "the analytical shapes of the pdfin equations ( 5 ) are established in section 2 . the quantile function presented in section 3 .",
    "the expressions for the moment generating function and moments corresponding to equation ( 5 ) are given in section 4 .",
    "limiting distribution of sample statistics like maximum and minimum has been shown in section 5 . in section 6 ,",
    "entropy of l - e distribution is presented .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimation procedure is considered in section 7 .",
    "the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators for small samples is assessed by simulation in section 8 .",
    "section 9 gives estimation of stress - strength parameter r by using maximum likelihood estimation method .",
    "finally we conclude the paper by showing applicability of the model to the real data sets .",
    "here , the shape of pdf ( 5 ) follows from theorem 1 . + * theorem 1 : * the probability density function of the l - e distribution is decreasing for @xmath15 and unimodel for @xmath16 . in the latter case , mode is a root of the following equation : @xmath17 _ proof : _ the first order derivative of @xmath18 is @xmath19 where , @xmath20 . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the function @xmath22 is negative .",
    "so @xmath23 for all @xmath24 .",
    "this implies that @xmath25 is decreasing for @xmath26 .",
    "also note that , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that for @xmath16 , @xmath29 has a unique mode at @xmath30 such that @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "so , @xmath35 is unimodal function with mode at @xmath36 .",
    "the pdf for various values of @xmath13 and @xmath0 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath37     and @xmath0.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we , now , consider the hazard rate function ( hrf ) of the l - e distribution , which is given by @xmath38 + * proposition 1 * : for @xmath39 the hazard rate function follows relation @xmath40 .",

    "+ in figure 2 , hazard function for different values of parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath37     and @xmath0.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "the cdf , @xmath43 , can be obtained by using eq.([4 ] ) .",
    "further , it can be noted that @xmath44 is continuous and strictly increasing so the quantile function of @xmath45 is @xmath46 , @xmath47 . in the following theorem",
    ", we give an explicit expression for @xmath48 in terms of the lambert @xmath49 function . for more details on lambert @xmath50 function",
    "we refer the reader to jodr @xcite .",
    "* theorem 2 : * for any @xmath51 , the quantile function of the l - e distribution @xmath45 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the negative branch of the lambert w function .",
    "+   + _ proof : _ by assuming @xmath54 , the cdf can be written as @xmath55 for fixed @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the @xmath58 quantile function is obtained by solving @xmath59 .",
    "by re - arranging the above , we obtain @xmath60 taking exponential and multiplying @xmath61 on both sides , we get + @xmath62 by using definition of lambert - w function ( @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a complex number ) , we see that @xmath65 is the lambert @xmath49 function of the real argument @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath67 moreover , for any @xmath51 it is immediate that @xmath68 , and it can also be checked that @xmath69 since @xmath57 . therefore , by taking into account the properties of the negative branch of the lambert w function , we have @xmath70 also by substituting @xmath54 in cdf and solving it for @xmath71 , we get @xmath72    @xmath73    further the first three quantiles we obtained by substituting @xmath74 in equation ( 11 ) .    @xmath75",
    "the moment generating function of the random variable @xmath76 follow l - e distribution is given as + @xmath77 where , @xmath78 and @xmath79 known as digamma function . +",
    "hence the first and second raw moments can be obtained by @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "+ @xmath82 where @xmath83 is eulergamma constant = 0.577216 .",
    "+ table 1 displays the mode , mean and median for l - e distribution for different choices of parameter @xmath13 and @xmath0 .",
    "it can be observed from the table that all the three measures of central tendency decrease with increase in @xmath13 and increase with an increase in @xmath0 .",
