    "dissipative systems are dynamical systems which lose energy over time . in classical physics",
    ", this typically happens due to friction or turbulence . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the loss of energy is due to processes like the spontaneous emission of photons .",
    "the observation of a photon as well as the observation of no photons reveals information about the system , thereby resulting in a so - called environment - induced measurement @xcite .",
    "these measurements can assist quantum computational tasks , like the controlled generation of entanglement , in many different ways @xcite .",
    "measurement - based state preparation schemes are in general relatively simple and promise very high fidelities .",
    "in fact , their performance is widely independent of the concrete size of the experimental parameters . in general",
    ", it is only limited by the accuracy with which the relevant measurement outcomes can be detected .",
    "for example , no - photon measurements can improve the performance of adiabatic passages by stabilising the trajectory of the system from one quantum state into another @xcite .",
    "they are also able to restrict the time evolution of a system onto a decoherence - free subspace , thereby resulting in very robust and relatively simple quantum computing schemes @xcite .",
    "another way to take advantage of dissipation is to use photon measurements for the build up of highly entangled states for distributed quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of this approach has already been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "moreover , continuous photon measurements can be used to control entanglement via direct quantum feedback @xcite .",
    "alternatively , verstraete _ et al . _",
    "@xcite recently suggested to engineer dissipative processes to prepare the ground states of frustration - free hamiltonians without having to register measurement outcomes .",
    "these processes can be employed for efficient universal quantum computing . at the same time , kraus _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that dissipation can be used to prepare multipartite entangled states with efficient relaxation times in the number of qubits by designing the system interactions and environmental couplings such that the desired state is the stationary state of the system .",
    "in general , this requires the design of non - local jump operators . only for certain target states , jump operators",
    "are found which need to act only on a few neighboring qubits .",
    "the scheme @xcite moreover requires that the desired stationary state of the system is unique .",

    "the application of the proposed state preparation scheme to concrete physical systems of interacting atomic qubits , like atoms in optical lattices , ion traps , or atoms in optical tweezers , is straightforward , since we do not require complex system - reservoir interactions which result in non - local jump operators .",
    "instead the cooling process is realised via laser driving of auxiliary atomic states and the free - space emission of photons . as we shall see below , our scheme is analog to laser sideband cooling .",
    "all qubit states other than the ground state of @xmath0 are resonantly driven by laser fields . when combined with dissipation ,",
    "the result of this driving is the transfer of an arbitrary initial state into a highly entangled pure state @xcite .",

    "we calculate the fidelity of the prepared state as a function of the system parameters and determine the corresponding cooling rates for concrete examples with one and two qubits .",
    "finally , we summarise our results in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "in the following we consider a quantum system consisting of @xmath1 interacting atomic qubits and a laser cooling device .",
    "we introduce the notation that will be used throughout the paper and derive the hamiltonian and the master equation of such a system .",
