    "noncontact friction arises in atom - surface interactions ; the theoretical treatment has given rise to some discussion  @xcite . in a simplified understanding , for an ion flying by a dielectric surface ( `` wall '' ) ,",
    "the quantum friction effect can be understood in terms of ohmic heating of the material by the motion of the image charge inside the medium .",
    "alternatively , one can understand it in terms of the thermal fluctuations of the electric fields in the vicinity of the dielectric , and the backreaction onto the motion of the ion or atom in the vicinity of the `` wall '' .",
    "it has recently been argued that one can not separate the van - der - waals force , at finite temperature , from the friction effect  @xcite .",
    "the backaction effect is due to the fluctuations of the atomic dipole moment  @xcite , which are mirrored by the wall and react back onto the atom ; this leads to an additional contribution to the friction force .",
    "in contrast to the `` direct '' term created by the electromagnetic field fluctuations inside the medium  @xcite ( proportional to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the atom - wall distance ) , the backaction term leads to a @xmath2 effect .",
    "a comparison of the magnitude of these two effects , for realistic dielectric response functions of materials , and using a detailed model of the atomic polarizability , is the subject of the current paper .",
    "while the @xmath2 effect is parametrically suppressed for large atom - wall separations , the numerical coefficients may still change the hierarchy of the effects .",
    "we should also note that the direct term  @xcite can be formulated as an integral over the imaginary part of the polarizability , and of the dielectric response function of the material .",
    "recently , we found a conceptually interesting `` one - loop '' dominance for the imaginary part of the polarizability  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the polarizability describes a process where the atom emits radiation at the same frequency as the incident laser radiation , but in a different direction .",
    "note that , by contrast , rabi flopping involves continuous absorption and emission into the laser mode ; the laser - dressed states  @xcite are superpositions of states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of laser photons while @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the atomic ground and excited states .",
    "_ a priori _ , this rabi flopping may proceed off resonance .",
    "feynman diagrams contributing to the imaginary part of the polarizability .",
    "a photon is absorbed from a bath ( denoted by the external crosses ) , while a second photon of equal frequency ( nonresonant with respect to an atomic transition ) is emitted ( cutkosky rules ) . ]    by contrast , when the ac stark shift of an atomic level is formulated perturbatively and the second - order shift of the atomic level in the external laser field is evaluated using a second - quantized formalism ( see sec .",
    "iii of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a resonance condition has to be fulfilled in order for an imaginary part of the energy shift to be generated .",
    "namely , the final state of atom@xmath10field in the decay process has to have exactly the same energy as the reference state of atom@xmath10field .",
    "this is possible only at exact resonance , when the emitted photon has just the right frequency to compensate the `` quantum jump '' of the bound electron from an excited state to an energetically lower state  @xcite .",
    "the ac stark shift is proportional to the atomic polarizability .",
    "its tree - level imaginary part  @xcite corresponds to spontaneous emission of the atom at an exact resonance frequency , still , not necessarily along the same direction as the incident laser photon .",
    "when quantum electrodynamics is involved , it is seen that due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field , spontaneous emission is possible off resonance . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the imaginary part of the polarizability was found to be dominated by a self - energy correction to the ac stark shift .",
    "physically , the imaginary part of the polarizability corresponds to a `` decay rate '' of the reference state @xmath11 used in the calculation of the ac stark shift , to a state @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the atomic reference state , the occupation number of the laser mode is @xmath7 , and there is either zero or one photon in the mode @xmath14 . while the laser frequency is equal to the frequency of the emitted radiation ( @xmath15 ) , the emission proceeds into a different direction as compared to the laser wave vector ( @xmath16 ) . off resonance ,",
    "the quantum electrodynamic one - loop effect calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite thus dominates the imaginary part of the polarizability , not the tree - level term .",
    "this is quite surprising ; the relevant feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "the peculiar behavior of the imaginary part of the polarizability suggests a detailed numerical study of the noncontact friction integral  @xcite , and comparison , of the direct and backaction terms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we attempt to shed some light on the derivation of the effect .",
    "full si  mksa units are kept throughout the derivation .",
    "the numerical calculations of noncontact friction for the hydrogen and helium interactions with @xmath3-quartz , gold , and caf@xmath17 are described in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , where we shall use atomic units for for frequency data and friction coefficients in tables  [ table1][table5 ] .",
    "we employ a convenient fit to the vibrational and interband excitations of the @xmath3-quartz and caf@xmath17 lattices .",

    "the contribution proportional to @xmath21 is included as a result of a backaction term , which takes the variation of the spontaneous and induced fields over the spatial amplitude of the oscillatory motion of the atom into account [ see eq .  ] .",
