    "the flavor problem has two aspects : explaining the pattern of quark and lepton mixing angles and explaining the pattern of inter - family mass hierarchies . in this paper",
    "we show that an idea proposed in 1996 @xcite for explaining the mass hierarchies can be successfully combined with an idea proposed in 2012 @xcite for explaining the mixing .",
    "we shall refer to these as the  bb idea \" and the  bc idea \" respectively .",
    "the two ideas are actually complementary , and by combining them a model emerges that is simpler and more explanatory than either by itself .",
    "we shall first briefly review the two ideas and then show how they can be combined .",
    "the bb idea was based on the observation that the inter - family mass hierarchy of the up quarks @xmath0 is stronger than those of the down quarks @xmath1 and charged leptons @xmath2 , which in turn are stronger than that of the neutrinos .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the strengths of these hierarchies correlate , in an @xmath3 framework , with the number of fermion @xmath4-plets that appear in the corresponding yukawa terms .",
    "up quark masses come from @xmath5 terms , which have two factors of fermion @xmath4-plets . down quark and",
    "charged lepton masses come from @xmath6 terms , which have only one such factor . and",
    "the neutrino masses come from effective dimension-5 @xmath7 terms , which contain no such factors .",
    "the bb idea was that every fermion 10-plet in a yukawa term is accompanied by a factor in the mass matrix of a hierarchical , diagonal matrix @xmath8 , which one can write as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "this can happen as the result of the mixing of the 10-plets in the usual three chiral families , which we denote by @xmath11 , with  extra \" vectorlike 10-plets , which we denote by @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "let the  underlying \" yukawa terms that give electroweak - breaking quark and lepton masses be of the form    @xmath14    the role of the term with the @xmath15 of higgs fields is to give different contributions to the mass matrices of the down quarks and charged leptons @xcite and thus avoid the  bad \" predictions of minimal @xmath3 that @xmath16 , and @xmath17 at the gut scale .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 and @xmath19 mix in a family - diagonal way to produce a light linear combination @xmath20 that contains standard model fermions and an orthogonal linear combination @xmath21 that is superheavy .",
    "then one can write    @xmath22    substituting this into eq . ( 1 ) , one obtains for the effective yukawa terms of the standard model fermions    @xmath23    therefore , the effective quark and lepton mass terms of the standard model quarks and leptons can be written    @xmath24    where    @xmath25    and where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "these four  underlying \" mass matrices @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are not assumed to have any special form , and therefore for each of them one expects all the elements to be roughly of the same order . from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) one has    @xmath32    where ",
    "@xmath33 \" means that the various elements are of the given order of magnitude .",
    "this obviously gives    @xmath34    this reproduces well , in a qualitative way , the strengths of the inter - family mass hierarchies of the different types of fermions . also from inspection of eq .",
    "( 6 ) it is apparent that    @xmath35    this gives @xmath36 mns mixing angles and small ckm mixing angles , with @xmath37 , which also is qualitatively correct . on the other hand , since there are no constraints on the forms of the four underlying @xmath38 mass matrices @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath31 , the bb idea in this form has many free parameters and can only make qualitative post - dictions rather than precise quantitative predictions .",
    "we turn now to a review of the bc idea @xcite .",
    "the bc idea is that all inter - family mixing among the standard model fermions arises from a single source .",
    "this source is the mixing between the @xmath42 multiplets in the three chiral families and those in extra @xmath43 vectorlike pairs .",
    "because mixing comes from the @xmath42 multiplets of @xmath3 , there is large mixing only for left - handed leptons and right - handed quarks , thus also explaining why the mns mixing is large and the ckm mixing is small .",
    "( this is the basic idea of so - called  lopsided models \" @xcite . )",
    "the specific assumption in the bc model is that if there existed _ only _ the three chiral families , then the quark and lepton mass matrices would be diagonal due to abelian family symmetries .",
    "but the extra @xmath43 vectorlike multiplets , which are assumed _ not _ to transform under the family symmetries , are able to mix with the chiral families due to spontaneous breaking of those symmetries .",
    "this induces mixing among the families of standard model quarks and leptons .    in the bc model ,",
    "the fermion content consists of @xmath44 , where @xmath13 and @xmath45 .",
    "there are abelian symmetries @xmath46 , such that under @xmath47 the fields @xmath20 and @xmath48 are odd if @xmath49 but even if @xmath50 . as a consequence , the  underlying \" yukawa terms of the three chiral families have the family - diagonal form    @xmath51    the abelian family symmetries are broken spontaneously by the vevs of standard - model - singlet scalars @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "( like the fermions , @xmath52 is odd under @xmath47 if @xmath54 and even otherwise . )",
    "this allows the chiral fermions and the extra vectorlike fermions to mix through the following yukawa terms : @xmath55 . because of these terms , the @xmath56 and @xmath57 mix to produce three linear combinations , @xmath48 , which contain standard model quarks and leptons , and @xmath58 linear combinations @xmath59 that are orthogonal to them and superheavy",
    "one can therefore write    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are non - diagonal matrices satisfying @xmath63 . substituting eq .",
    "( 10 ) into eq .",
    "( 9 ) , one finds that the effective mass terms for the standard model quarks and leptons can be written    @xmath64    where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the non - zero elements of these diagonal matrices are free parameters of the model . to fit the observed quark and lepton masses they must be hierarchical , but the bc model does not attempt to explain these hierarchies or relate them to each other .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the matrix @xmath61 can be brought by changes of basis to the form    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is a unitary matrix , @xmath71 is the diagonal matrix @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is a triangular matrix of the form    @xmath74    and @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are real numbers .",
    "the matrix @xmath70 can be eliminated by redefining the fields of the right - handed quarks and left - handed leptons .",
    "these redefinitions do not affect the ckm or mns mixing matrices .",
    "( they do not affect the ckm matrix , as only a redefinition of the _ right - handed _",
    "quarks is involved .",
    "they do not affect the mns mixing matrix , since the same redefinition is done on the neutrinos and charged leptons . )",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath71 can be absorbed into the diagonal matrices : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "after these redefinitions one has    @xmath82    the elements of the diagonal matrix @xmath83 are obviously just the masses of the up quarks , @xmath84 .",
    "one can also easily show that to a very good approximation the elements of the diagonal matrices @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the masses of down quarks and charged leptons : @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "that means that in the basis in which the up quark mass matrix is diagonal the mass matrix of the down quarks is given by    @xmath89    from this one can read off directly that @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the triangular matrix @xmath73 can be written    @xmath93    the mass matrix @xmath94 of the charged leptons , given in eq . ( 14 ) , is obviously not diagonal .",
    "however , it is easily seen that it is diagonalized by rotations of the _ right - handed",
    "_ leptons by angles that are of order @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , while the required rotations of the _ left - handed _ leptons are only of order the squares of these ratios , and thus negligible . as far as the left - handed charged leptons are concerned , therefore , we are effectively in the mass basis . combining eq .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 16 ) , one has the following expression for the neutrino mass matrix    @xmath98    the five free parameters @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 determine all nine neutrino properties : the three neutrino massses , three mns mixing angles , the dirac cp phase of the leptons , and the two majorana cp phases .",
    "so there are four predictions .",
    "these are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "what was found there was that a good fit is obtained to the three neutrino mixing angles and to the neutrino mass splittings , and that the dirac cp phase of the leptons is predicted to be roughly 210 degrees .",
    "the values of the parameters that gave the best fits were @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 radians , and @xmath107 radians .",
    "the values of @xmath99 and @xmath101 are important for our later discussions .",
    "in the bb idea , all the inter - family mass hierarchies come from the single matrix @xmath8 , while in the bc idea all the inter - family mixing comes from the single matrix @xmath61 .",
    "the question naturally arises whether these two ideas can be combined in such a way that the whole flavor structure can be accounted for with _ only _ the matrices @xmath61 and @xmath8 , thereby producing a more predictive and explanatory model .",
    "the answer is yes , as we shall now show by describing a specific model that does this .",
    "the fermion content of the model consists of the following @xmath3 multiplets :    @xmath108    yukawa terms involving only @xmath18 and @xmath56 will give rise to  underlying \" mass matrices that get multiplied by factors of the matrices @xmath8 and @xmath61 . in order for @xmath8 and @xmath61 to account for _ all _ the flavor structure",
    ", the underlying mass matrices should have a trivial flavor structure , _",
    "i.e. _ they should be proportional to the identity matrix .. this can be the case if there is an @xmath109 family symmetry under which the @xmath18 and @xmath56 transform as triplets .",
    "the underlying yukawa terms would then have the form    @xmath110    note that unlike eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 9 ) there is no term here with the @xmath111 of higgs fields . since all the underlying yukawa terms must be flavor - independent , due to the @xmath109 symmetry , adding a term with the @xmath111 in eq . ( 19 ) would still leave the down quark and charged lepton mass matrices proportional to each other at the gut scale .",
    "therefore , the group - theoretical factors needed to avoid the  bad \" minimal @xmath3 relation @xmath112 must appear in either the @xmath8 or @xmath61 matrices . in the model we are describing , they will appear in the @xmath8 matrix , as will be seen .",
    "the matrix @xmath61 arises , in exactly the manner explained earlier , from the mixing of the @xmath56 with the  extra \" @xmath113 , which are assumed not to transform under any flavor symmetry .",
    "let there be at least two standard - models - singlet higgs fields that are triplets under @xmath109 , denoted by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 labels the higgs triplet and @xmath116 is the @xmath109 index .",
    "then one can write the following mass and yukawa terms for the fermion 5-plets :    @xmath117    where @xmath118 .",
    "we assume that the matrices @xmath119 and @xmath120 are superheavy and of the same order .",
    "( for example , they may both be of order the gut scale . )",
    "these terms will make @xmath58 linear combinations of the @xmath42 fields superheavy and leave three linear combinations light .",
    "these light linear combinations , which contain standard model quarks and leptons , will be denoted @xmath48 .",
    "the superheavy combinations will be denoted by @xmath121 .",
    "it is easily seen that if @xmath122^{-1/2}$ ] and @xmath123^{-1/2 } t^{\\dag}$ ] , where @xmath124 , then @xmath125 .",
    "exactly as in the bc model , when substituted into eq .",
    "( 19 ) , this leads to factors of @xmath61 in the effective mass matrices of the standard model quarks and leptons .",
    "the factors of @xmath8 in those matrices arise , as in the bb scheme , from the mixing of @xmath18 with the @xmath126 . in order for @xmath8 to come out diagonal ,",
    "the @xmath127 must transform under a flavor symmetry .",
    "a simple possibility is an abelian symmetry @xmath46 , such that @xmath126 and @xmath128 are odd under @xmath129 if @xmath130 and even otherwise .",
    "let there be three standard - model - singlet higgs fields @xmath131 , which are triplets under @xmath109 and transform under @xmath46 in the obvious way",
    ". then the following mass and yukawa terms of the fermion 10-plets are allowed    @xmath132    the role of the adjoint higgs fields @xmath133 and @xmath134 is to introduce @xmath3 breaking into the quark and lepton mass matrices , through @xmath8 , and thus avoid the  bad \" minimal @xmath3 prediction that the down quark masses equal the charged lepton masses at the gut scale .",
    "it is notationally simpler , however , to explain the mixing of the 10-plets without considering the effects of the adjoint fields in eq .",
    "( 21 ) , so we will first discuss the unrealistic case where their vevs are set to zero ( which we will call the  minimal model \" ) and then later discuss the realistic case where their vevs are non - zero .",
    "if certain coefficients in the higgs potential are positive then the vevs of @xmath131 will be orthogonal to each other in @xmath109 space : @xmath135 .",
    "( in particular , if the coefficients of the terms @xmath136 are positive it will ensure this orthogonality . ) without loss of generality , one can then choose a basis in @xmath109 space such that the axes are aligned with the vevs of the three singlet vevs .",
    "that is , so that @xmath137 .",
    "defining , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , eq .",
    "( 21 ) with adjoint vevs set to zero gives    @xmath140    the three linear combinations of 10-plets appearing with the parentheses in eq .",
    "( 22 ) are superheavy and will be denoted @xmath141 , whereas the three linear combinations @xmath142 that are orthogonal to them contain standard model fermions and will be denoted @xmath20 .",
    "this gives    @xmath143    where @xmath144 and @xmath145 . substituting this into eq .",
    "( 19 ) , one finds that every factor of @xmath20 in the effective yukawa couplings of the standard model fermions is accompanied by a factor of @xmath146 , as in eq .",
    "we will assume a hierarchical pattern @xmath147 .",
    "then we can define a matrix @xmath8 by    @xmath148    substituting @xmath125 and eq .",
    "( 23 ) into eq .",
    "( 19 ) and using eq .",
    "( 24 ) , the effective mass matrices of the standard model quarks and leptons can then be written    @xmath149    this is the basic result of the model .",
    "other than certain overall mass scales ( @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath103 ) all the flavor structure of the quarks and leptons is controlled by two matrices : a mixing matrix @xmath61 and a hierarchy matrix @xmath8 . in going to the last expressions in each line of eq .",
    "( 25 ) , we have used @xmath152 and absorbed @xmath70 by field redefinitions ( as explained previously ) .",
    "we write the matrix @xmath71 as @xmath153 and absorb the factors of @xmath154 into redefined mass scales @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "one therefore ends up with the following result ( for the  minimal \" version of the model ) :",
    "@xmath157    of course , the form obtained for @xmath158 is the same as shown in eq .",
    "the parameters called @xmath159 and @xmath160 in eq .",
    "( 17 ) are here called @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "it should be noted that in eq .",
    "( 26 ) , the phases of @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 do not matter for the matrices @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 , as they can be absorbed into the fermion fields .",
    "but for the neutrino mass matrix @xmath158 the phases of @xmath163 and @xmath164 do make a difference , and have to take definite values to fit the neutrino masses and maxing angles .",
    "one easily sees from eq .",
    "( 26 ) that in this  minimal model \" one has , to very good approximation , the following  postdictions \" :    @xmath170    from fitting the neutrino masses and mixing angles @xcite , one can determine @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "( see the discussion after eq .",
    "( 17 ) . ) and one can obtain the values of @xmath173 and @xmath174 directly from the up quark mass ratios : @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "( we take the fermion masses here and in the following equation to be the masses at @xmath177 as run up to that scale using the standard model renormalizaton group equations @xcite . ) from these values one has the following result :    @xmath178    one sees that the minimal model works surprisingly well , in fact better than in the bb idea taken by itself , where the inter - family mass ratios of the charged leptons and of the down quarks are @xmath179 , as shown in eq .",
    "( that would give @xmath180 , which is off by an order of magnitude for the electron . )",
    "thus the factors of @xmath163 and @xmath164 , which come from combining the bb and bc ideas , give more realistic down quark and charged lepton mass hierarchies .",
    "the combined model we are describing ( so far in a minimal form ) is more explanatory than the bc model . in the bc model",
    "the inter - family mass hierarchies of the up quarks , down quarks , charged leptons , and neutrinos are completely unrelated , being determined by four diagonal matrices whose elements are free parameters . in the combined model , these hierarchies are all related , and related in a way that we have just seen is qualitatively correct .",
    "the 12 parameters in the four hierarchical diagonal matrices of the bc model are replaced by just 7 parameters in the minimal model : @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath150 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 .",
    "this would be a huge increase in predictivity , but of course it is _ too _ predictive , since the minimal model gives the  bad \" minimal @xmath3 prediction that the charged lepton masses are equal to the down quark masses at the gut scale . to cure this problem",
    "requires that group - theoretical factors reflecting the breaking of @xmath3 appear in the fermion mass matrices .",
    "the simplest way for this to happen is through the matrix @xmath8 as a result of the adjoint higgs fields in eq .",
    "( 21 ) getting non - zero vevs .",
    "we shall now look at this in detail .",
    "as can be seen from eq . ( 28 ) , the group - theoretical factors must enhance the muon mass and the @xmath154 quark mass by about a factor of about 3 while having little effect on the other quark and lepton masses .",
    "one obtains a similar conclusion if one runs the fermion masses assuming low - energy supersymmetry . using the results of @xcite , where the masses are run up to @xmath177 gev , in the mssm with @xmath183 , one finds    @xmath184",
    "these imply that @xmath185    the ratios given in eq .",
    "( 30 ) , which are all predicted to be equal to 1 in the minimal model , must be accounted for by the group - theoretical factors .    seemingly , the simplest way to do this is through the coupling of adjoint higgs fields to the 10-plets of fermions , as shown in eq .",
    "let us first just consider the effect of the vev of the @xmath133 , which couples as @xmath186 .",
    "if we define @xmath187 by @xmath188 , where @xmath189 stands for the fermion type @xmath190 , or @xmath191 , then the effect is that in eq . ( 22 ) , @xmath192 gets replaced by @xmath193 .",

    "( 23 ) are different for different fermion types and given approximately by    @xmath195    where @xmath196 is the weak hypercharge of the fermion of type @xmath189 . then the matrix @xmath8 defined in eq .",

    "( 30 ) . with the group - theoretic factors of eq .",

    "indeed , it turns out that there is no fit .",
    "it is for this reason that one must include the effect of the term containing @xmath134 in eq .",
    "actually , only one such adjoint higgs field is required to obtain a good fit , namely @xmath218 . however , as the expressions are somewhat complicated looking , we do not show them .",
    "one sees , then , that introducing the group - theoretic factors required to break the well - known minimal @xmath3 mass degeneracies means that the model ends up with as many free parameters as there are in the bc model of @xcite . thus combining that model with the bb idea",
    "leads to no increase in the number of precise quantitative predictions .",
    "however , there is a gain in explanatoru power , in that the inter - family mass hierarchies of the different types of fermions are related to each other in a way that is qualitative correct .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the values of @xmath163 and @xmath164 , the elements of the diagonal matrix @xmath71 .",
    "it is a non - trivial condition for the viability of the model that the same values of @xmath181 and @xmath182 give realistic results both for the neutrino properties and for the mass hierarchies of the down quarks and charged leptons .",
    "as we have seen , the model clears this hurdle .",
    "the fit to the neutrino properties obtained in @xcite gives @xmath219 and @xmath220 , and these values also give realistic mass hierarchies , as shown in eq .",

    "<S> it is shown that an idea proposed in 1996 that relates in a qualitatively correct way the inter - family mass hierarchies of the up quarks , down quarks , charged leptons , and neutrinos , can be combined with a predictive scheme recently proposed for relating quark mixing and neutrino mixing . in the resulting model , the entire flavor structure of the quarks and leptons is expressible in terms of two  master matrices \" : a diagonal matrix that gives the inter - family mass ratios , and an off - diagonal matrix that controls all flavor mixing . </S>"
