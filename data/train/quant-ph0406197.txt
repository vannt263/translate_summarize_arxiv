    "the prospect of the creation of a continuous , coherent atomic beam , the atomic analogy of laser beam , has been of great interest to many ever since the successful generation of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "one of the major challenges to such applications lies in the difficulty in continuous condensation of atomic gas due to stringent cooling conditions . towards that goal , one needs to spatially separate the evaporative cooling from the destructive laser cooling , which is still pretty challenging even though there ve been interesting investigations and progresses @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can realize a continuous source of condensate by bringing new condensates into the trap and uniting them .",
    "note that independently prepared condensates have a completely random relative phase ; in order to unite them , one needs to have a phase cooling mechanism to get rid of this random phase .",
    "interesting theoretical investigations have been carried out on the possibilities of uniting two existing condensates through laser induced phase cooling with condensates confined in a high - q ring cavity @xcite , or through phase locking with feedbacks from a series of interference measurements @xcite .",
    "recently , chikkatur _ et al . _ reported a striking experiment in which two independently produced condensates were merged directly in space by bringing their traps together to a complete overlap@xcite .",
    "a condensate fraction larger than the initial components was observed from the subsequent time - of - flight imaging .",
    "this raises the question as how the relative phase between the two component condensates is established during this direct merging where there is no additional phase cooling or locking . in this paper",
    ", we investigate this puzzling phase dynamics both in the ideal adiabatic merging limit and in the more practical non - adiabatic circumstance . in the ideal adiabatic limit ,",
    "we show that a unique relative phase will be established between the two components during direct merging , resulting from the eigenstate evolution of the governing hamiltonian ( an effective two - mode model ) .",
    "the hamiltonian has degenerate ground states corresponding to two fragmented condensates when the traps are apart .",
    "when we overlap the two traps , the degenerate ground states evolve into a single eigenstate corresponding to a single condensate with a unique relative phase between the two initial components .",
    "while the adiabatic limit requires very slow merging , the real experiment is actually performed far from that limit @xcite . in this case",
    ", the atoms will slip from the ground state to all the nearby eigenstates , and one would not expect to get a single condensate .",
    "however , through a careful analysis of the eigenstate structure of the governing hamiltonian , we argue that one can still get a large condensate fraction ( larger than either of the initial components ) with a unique relative phase in this non - adiabatic limit .",
    "we then confirm this evolution picture through detailed numerical simulations of the merging dynamics .",
    "we should also point out that the non - adiabatic merging considered in this paper , which is based on the parameters of the experiment @xcite , is not an abrupt connection of the two condensates . in the latter case",
    ", a unique relative phase can not be established without careful consideration of dissipation @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "the time scale of the merger (  0.5 s ) is long when compared with the trap frequency ( 440hz ) along the merging direction@xcite .",
    "so the merging is actually adiabatic with respect to the evolution of the condensate wave packets ; and dissipation due to the quasi - particle excitation in each well should not play an important role .",
    "however , this same merging time scale is very short when compared with the lowest excitation energy of the relevant hamiltonian ( the effective two - mode model ) .",
    "many eigenstates of this hamiltonian will get populated during the merger .",
    "that is why we call it `` non - adiabatic '' .",
    "our central observation is that due to the particular eigen - energy distribution of this relevant two - mode hamiltonian , even for mergers much faster than the lowest excitation energy , only low - lying states of the hamiltonian will be populated .",
    "furthermore , for all the populated low - lying states , the relative phase between the two initial condensate components is well locked . as a result",
    ", we will get a large merged condensate fraction with a uniquely established relative phase .",
    "in the following , we first present a theoretical model for the description of the direct merging process , and argue that the internal phase dynamics is mainly captured by the simplified two - mode hamiltonian with time dependent parameters , which has been a popular model for many theoretical investigations in different scenarios @xcite .",
    "after that , we go to the main topic and investigate the relative phase dynamics .",
    "the result in the adiabatic limit can be easily understood . in the non - adiabatic limit ,",
    "the arguments need to be based on the analysis of the detailed evolution structure of the eigenstates of the time - dependent hamiltonian . then in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the relative phase dynamics and the evolution of the condensate fraction through detailed numerical simulations , with the evolution speed ranging from the adiabatic limit to the far non - adiabatic circumstance .",
    "we simulate the merging process with different configurations and different initial states of the two components .",
    "finally , we discuss the relevance of the results to the reported experiment and to the prospect of producing continuous atom lasers based on condensate merging .",
    "consider two independently prepared condensates in separate traps at low temperature .",
    "the two traps are then brought closer along a certain direction to allow the condensates to merge , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the traps can be modeled as a time - dependent double - well potential @xmath0 , with the two wells moving towards each other .",
    "the interactions between the atoms are described by the usual @xmath1-pseudopotential , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the s - wave scattering length and @xmath4 is the mass of the atom .",
    "the second quantization hamiltonian for such a system has the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bosonic quantum field operator describing the atoms , and the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "when the traps are not overlapping , the atoms in the same condensate are in the same quantum mode .",
    "we can expand the atomic field operator @xmath8 as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 @xmath11are the corresponding mean - fields from the gross - pitaevski equation for each trap .",
    "when we bring the two condensates closer by varying the trap potential @xmath0 , we assume that the atomic density profile adiabatically follows the movement of the traps , as is the case in the experiment@xcite . with this assumption , at any given time @xmath12",
    ", we can still use a variational mean field @xmath13 to describe the corresponding condensate .",
    "the condensate wave functions now overlap in space , and the atoms in different condensates can tunnel to each other through the trap barrier . as a good approximation , we can expand the atomic field @xmath14 at time @xmath12 as @xmath15 . with this expansion ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is simplified to the following well - known two - mode model @xmath16 where the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 @xmath20 in writing eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we have assumed a symmetric trap with @xmath21 , and we have neglected terms that are functions only of the atom number @xmath22 , as they commute with @xmath23 and can be eliminated by going to a rotating frame .",
    "we have also neglected the nonlinear tunneling terms proportional to @xmath24 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the coefficient before that term ) because they are either typically smaller than or have the same effect as the linear tunneling , so that neglecting them does not change the basic physics @xcite .",
    "note that given all the approximations above , the factor before the last term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) has some arbitrariness as this term is on the same order of magnitude as some neglected terms in the weak overlapping limit . as a convenient choice",
    ", we take the factor to be @xmath25 so that we have a vanishing @xmath26 as the two traps completely overlap , as one would expect on physical grounds . the two - mode hamiltonian ( 2 ) , which is a very popular model for many theoretical investigations in different scenarios @xcite , catches the main physics of condensates in double - well potentials resulting from the competition between the tunneling and the local nonlinear collision interaction .",
    "a more detailed and more rigorous derivation of the two - mode model from the variational approximation can be found in ref .",
    "one important limitation for applications of the two - mode model is that when the two condensates get very close , the coupling between the two condensates becomes so strong that some approximations underlying the two - mode model are not well justified . in that strong overlapping region ,",
    "( 2)-(4 ) serve as a convenient extrapolation .",
    "however , numerical calculation reveals that the relative phase and the condensate fraction are established shortly after the commencement of the merger , when the two condensates are not yet strongly coupled .",
    "it is under this context that we think an effective two - mode model catches the main physics and is adequate for the understanding of the relative phase evolution .",
    "we will use the time - dependent two - mode model ( hamiltonian ( 2 ) ) to investigate the relative phase dynamics during the merging of independent condensates .",
    "the temporal behavior of the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 in principle should be derived from the self - consistent variational solutions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which is pretty involved .",
    "fortunately , in the following we will see that the relative phase dynamics is actually insensitive to the details of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it only depends on the rough scale of their rates of variation .",
    "hence , for the following discussions in this section , we do not specify the explicit forms of @xmath29 and @xmath18 .",
    "nevertheless , we do know the rough trends of the evolutions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "as the two traps approach each other , @xmath18  will continuously increase from zero to a maximum value @xmath30 .",
    "compared with @xmath31 , @xmath17 typically changes much more slowly at the beginning of the merger , and can be roughly taken as a constant @xmath32 as the two traps further merge approaching to a complete overlap , one expects that @xmath17 will gradually decrease to zero .",
    "these rough trends of evolutions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are important for the understanding of the relative phase dynamics .      for the convenience of the following discussions ,",
    "we write the two - mode model ( 2 ) using effective collective spin operators . with the standard schwinger representation of the spin operators @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , hamiltonian ( 2 )",
    "can be expressed in the following form @xmath36 this hamiltonian is actually equivalent to that of the infinite - range ising model @xcite , and one has effective anti - ferromagnetic interaction as @xmath37 .    first , let us assume that the temperature of the atoms is low enough , and that the variation speeds of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are very small .",
    "in this ideal adiabatic limit , the establishment of a unique relative phase through direct merging of condensates can be easily understood from the adiabatic theorem , which states that the system in such a limit will remain in the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath38 .",
    "initially , the two traps are far apart , therefore the self interaction among the atoms in each trap dominates with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the ground state in this case is an eigenstate of @xmath41 with eigenvalue of @xmath42 , i.e. , with @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the total atom number .",
    "the two condensates have equal number of atoms , but there is no phase relation between them , which corresponds to fragmented condensates . in the final stage of the merger , the coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the coupling energy @xmath47 thus dominates in the hamiltonian . the ground state in this case",
    "is an eigenstate of @xmath48 with the largest eigenvalue @xmath49 ( without loss of generality we assume @xmath50 ) .",
    "this state is actually an eigenstate of the number operator @xmath51 of the mode @xmath52 with an eigenvalue of @xmath53 , which corresponds to a single condensate .",
    "we then have a unique zero relative phase between the two initial condensate modes @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which is due to the fact that the coupling energy @xmath56 is minimized only when we have the same phase between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the above understanding of the relative phase establishment from the adiabatic theorem seems to be simple and straightforward , but in a sense it is pretty nontrivial .",
    "the relative phase really comes from a joint effect of the two competitive terms in the hamiltonian ( 5 ) .",
    "if we have only the collision interaction term @xmath59 and start with fragmented condensates with @xmath60 , it s obvious that the condensate fractions will never be changed by this collision interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "if we have only the coupling term @xmath61 , it will only rotate the two condensate modes @xmath54 and @xmath55 to two different modes @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and will never change the condensate fractions either .",
    "the condensate fractions can be quantitatively described by the eigenvalues of the following single - particle density matrix @xcite @xmath64 the system is in a single - condensate state if @xmath65 has only one macroscopic eigenvalue in the limit @xmath66 ; and it corresponds to fragmented condensates if @xmath65 has more macroscopic eigenvalues in the large @xmath44 limit .",
    "it is clear that the coupling term @xmath61 only makes a linear rotation of the modes @xmath67 and @xmath55 , and will never change the eigenvalues of the single - particle density matrix @xmath65 . clearly , it is the interplay between these two competing interactions in the hamiltonian ( 5 ) that is really responsible for producing a larger condensate fraction with a well - defined relative phase .",
    "the analysis above gives us a simple understanding of how a unique relative phase in principle could be established between two initially independent condensates through direct merging in the perfect adiabatic limit .",
    "however , this analysis hardly explains the merging dynamics in real experiments because the practical configurations are far from this ideal adiabatic limit .",
    "practically , first of all , we can never start with an equal number state for the two condensates .",
    "one can at most control the number of atoms in each condensate so that they are roughly the same , as each condensate has some number fluctuations typically on the order of @xmath68 .",
    "so in reality we can not start from the ground state of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) , but rather a statistical mixture of some low - lying states .",
    "secondly , to fulfill the conditions of the adiabatic passage , one requires that the variation speeds of @xmath17 and @xmath18 be significantly smaller than the smallest eigen - frequency splitting of the relevant hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 5 ) has an energy difference of @xmath69 between the ground and the first excited state when @xmath70 ( i.e. , when the traps are far apart ) .",
    "this is a tiny energy gap , which can be roughly estimated by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 denotes the chemical potential of the condensate ( @xmath73khz @xcite ) and the atom number is typically around @xmath74 .",
    "the merging time scale in real experiments ( @xmath75 s @xcite ) is much shorter than the time scale given by @xmath76 .",
    "this shows that we need to go beyond the adiabatic limit to understand the merging dynamics in practical configurations , which is the focus of our next subsection .",
    "if the evolution speed of the hamiltonian is beyond the adiabatic limit , the system prepared in the ground state will be excited to some upper eigenstates .",
    "the excitation probability will depend on the ratio of the variation rate of the hamiltonian to the smallest energy difference between the two eigenstates @xcite .",
    "the final state in this case is in general a superposition of different low - lying eigenstates which have been populated during the merger .",
    "therefore , to find out the final state of the system in the non - adiabatic circumstance , it is important to look at the evolution of all the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) during the merging process .    we have calculated the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) as a function of the ratio of @xmath77 for various atom numbers up to a few hundred ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite , where the energy spectrum is drawn for other purposes ) .",
    "the evolutions of the energy spectrum for different atom numbers are qualitatively very similar . to have a clear display , we only plot in fig .",
    "2 the whole energy spectrum of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) with a small atom number @xmath78 , as the energy levels become too dense to be seen clearly in a small figure if @xmath44 is large .",
    "2 is enough to show some general properties of the energy spectrum which are critical for the understanding of the merging dynamics outside of the adiabatic limit .",
    "the spectrum can be divided into three regions , corresponding respectively to the fock , the josephson , and the rabi region , as discussed in general josephson physics @xcite .",
    "first of all , on the left side of the spectrum ( @xmath79 ) , which corresponds to the fock region , there are a total of @xmath80 eigenlevels .",
    "while the lowest eigenlevel ( @xmath81 ) stays non - degenerate , the @xmath82th and @xmath83th ( @xmath84 ) levels are degenerate in energy .",
    "the two degenerate states can be expressed as @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the fock basis of the modes @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the energy difference between the ground state and the @xmath87th eigenlevel is given by @xmath88 .",
    "the quadratic scaling of the energy difference with @xmath89 is very important for the following discussions .",
    "secondly , on the far right side of the spectrum with @xmath90 ( not shown in fig .",
    "2 ) , the system enters the rabi region , where the eigenlevels are almost equally spaced . in that region",
    ", one can approximately neglect the term @xmath91 , and the energy levels are roughly eigenstates of the @xmath92 operator .",
    "the @xmath89th ( @xmath93 ) eigenlevel , expressed as @xmath94 in the dicke basis of the collective spin operator @xmath95 , has the energy @xmath96 ( compared with the ground state ) .",
    "between these two limiting cases , there is a wide intermediate josephson region where the two - mode model could be understood semi - classically @xcite . in the josephson region , with fixed @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the energy levels for the low eigenstates are also approximately equally spaced with the energy difference between the adjacent levels given by @xmath99 .        from the discussions above , we see that the fock region has the smallest energy spacing for the low - lying eigenstates with typical experimental parameters .",
    "the non - adiabatic transition therefore happens dominantly in or close to that region .",
    "however , due to the quadratic scaling of the energy spacing in that region , although non - adiabatic transition occurs , the atoms can only be excited to some low - lying eigenstates if they start from the ground state .",
    "the typical merging time in the experiment @xcite is about @xmath100 s , significantly longer than the time scale of @xmath101 , where @xmath72 ( @xmath73khz ) is the chemical potential .",
    "the parameters @xmath102 and @xmath72 are roughly on the same order of magnitude for typical atomic gas experiments . in the fock region ,",
    "the energy spacing between the @xmath103th excited state and the ground state is @xmath102 .",
    "so if the atoms start from the ground state , the final spread in the energy eigenstates due to the non - adiabatic transition is at most @xmath103 .",
    "of course , in real experiments it is not practical to start exactly from the ground state @xmath104 of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) when the traps are far apart .",
    "let us assume that the initial atom numbers @xmath105 and @xmath106 in the two traps are roughly the same with @xmath107 @xcite , and that each of them has some fluctuations typically on the order of @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "then , the initial spread in the energy eigenlevel is about @xmath103 .",
    "adding together quadratically the contributions from the non - adiabatic transfer and from the initial number fluctuations , we conclude that after the merger , the atoms will populate a mixture of the low - lying eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) , with a spread in the eigenstates characterized by @xmath108 ( in terms of the order of magnitude ) .",
    "now we want to show that even if the final state after the merger is a mixture of low - lying eigenstates , as long as the spread in the eigenstates @xmath109 , we still have a large single - condensate fraction .",
    "when the two traps are merged and we are in the rabi region , we can calculate the condensate fraction in the mode @xmath110 for each eigenstate of the @xmath92 operator . for the @xmath89th eigenstate @xmath111 of the @xmath92 operator ,",
    "its population in the mode @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 ( this result can be easily seen if we rotate @xmath92 to @xmath114 through a linear transformation on the modes @xmath54 and @xmath115 .",
    "now we are in a mixture of the eigenstates @xmath94 of the @xmath92 operator with @xmath89 up to @xmath108 . for this mixture state ,",
    "the atom number in the particular mode @xmath112 is at least @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , if the atom number @xmath44 is huge , we end up with the dominant fraction of atoms in the mode @xmath112 even if the merging is far outside the perfect adiabatic limit .",
    "the basic reason for this result lies in the fast growth of the excitation energy with the levels .",
    "the system is kept in some low - lying states of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) although the evolution is non - adiabatic . when most of the atoms are in the condensate mode @xmath112 , a unique relative phase of zero is correspondingly established between the two initial modes @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "in the previous sections , we have shown that through a direct merger it is possible to establish a unique relative phase between two initially independent condensates , and argued that this relative phase is robust and we can almost get a single condensate even if the merging is far outside the adiabatic limit ( @xmath117 ) . in this section , we would like to quantitatively test this result through more detailed numerical simulations of the merging dynamics .    to quantitatively describe the merging dynamics , we look at the evolution of the largest condensate fraction derived from the single - particle density matrix ( 6 ) .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of the single - particle density matrix @xmath118  can always be expressed as an expectation value @xmath119 , where @xmath112 is a rotated mode corresponding to the largest condensate fraction and is defined as @xmath120 .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath121 reflects the contributions to the new condensate mode @xmath112 from the two initial modes @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and @xmath122 specifies their relative phase in this new mode . with this characterization of the relative phase , here we ignore explicit discussion on the inherent quantum uncertainty of the phase operator caused by the finite total atom number .",
    "this quantum uncertainty is on the order of @xmath123 , where the atom number @xmath124 for typical experiments , so it represents a small effect .",
    "we refer the readers to ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussions on that issue .",
    "numerically , we start with certain initial states of the modes @xmath54 and @xmath55 , as will be detailed in the following subsections , solve the evolution of these states under the hamiltonian ( 5 ) , and calculate the single - particle density matrix for each instantaneous state to find out the evolution of the atom number @xmath125 in the largest condensate fraction mode @xmath112 and the corresponding parameters @xmath126 and @xmath122 . the atom number @xmath127 is given by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath65 , while @xmath126 and @xmath122 are specified by the corresponding eigenvector @xmath128 .    to quantify the state evolution , we need to specify the parameters @xmath129 and @xmath18 in the hamiltonian ( 5 ) as a function of time . to be consistent with the experimental configurations in ref .",
    "( 13 ) , we assume that the two initial condensates are confined in cigar - shaped traps which are moving towards each other along the radial direction with uniform speed . as we have mentioned before , the details of the functions @xmath129 and @xmath18 are not important , but rather their time scales .",
    "so , for simplicity , we assume that the wave functions @xmath130 @xmath11 of the modes @xmath131 , which adiabatically follow the movement of the cigar - shaped traps , also have cigar - shaped profiles specified by the following gaussian function    @xmath132 ^{2}+y^{2 } } { 2\\sigma _ { \\rho } ^{2}}\\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ \\times \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{z^{2}}{2\\sigma _ { z}^{2 } } \\right ] , \\hspace*{3.5 cm } \\label{12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the widths of the wave functions along the radial and the axial directions , respectively .",
    "the centers of the wavepackets are given by @xmath135 and @xmath136 , defining a constantly diminishing separation from @xmath137 to @xmath42 throughout the merging time @xmath138 .",
    "the variation of the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are then calculated with eqs .",
    "( 3)(4 ) from these postulated wave functions .",
    "the typical evolution of @xmath139 and @xmath140 are shown in fig .",
    "5(a - b ) with @xmath141 , following the experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "although in real experiments the total atom number is normally on the order of @xmath142 , in numerical simulations , due to the limited computation speed , we can only deal with moderate atom numbers with @xmath143 .",
    "however , we know that @xmath102 and @xmath30 are typically on the same order of magnitude with @xmath144 somewhat smaller than @xmath145 . in order to be consistent with the practical configurations , we should re - scale the parameters @xmath129 and @xmath18 with a global constant so that @xmath146 . in our simulation , without loss of generality , we assume @xmath147 .",
    "when @xmath17 and @xmath18 are specified , we can numerically calculate the evolution of the atom number @xmath127 in the largest condensate fraction and the relative phase @xmath122 with the method described above .",

    "the numerical results are shown in figs .",
    "( 3a)-(3h ) , where the largest condensate fraction @xmath150 ( defined as @xmath151 with @xmath152 ) and the parameters ( @xmath126,@xmath122 ) are plotted against the dimensionless time @xmath153 .",
    "note that for the initial fock state , the relative phase @xmath122 is not well defined ( random ) . in the numerical program , one basically randomly picks up a particular initial phase . in fig .",
    "3 , the initial value of @xmath122 is set to zero simply due to the convention of the program ( it sets phase @xmath154 for the complex number @xmath155 ) . the merging dynamics and the final relative phase",
    "do not depend on this particular choice .",
    "we test other assignments of the initial phase , and basically there are no changes in the dynamics ( except for different initial jumps of the phase which are meaningless ) .",
    "we have different merging time scales for figures ( a)-(h ) , ranging from the adiabatic limit @xmath156 to the complete non - adiabatic limit @xmath157 , where @xmath158 denotes the time of the merger . with @xmath159 , the picture of the adiabatic mapping",
    "is basically valid , and as expected , finally we have more than @xmath160 of atoms evolving into the largest condensate fraction ( see fig .",
    "3 g ) . for figs .",
    "( 3e ) and ( 3c ) , the time scales change from @xmath161 to @xmath162 , which is certainly outside the adiabatic limit as @xmath163 .",
    "however , since @xmath164 , as we analyzed in sec .",
    "iic , only some low - lying eigenlevels will be populated during the evolution , and we should have a good condensate fraction .",
    "this is confirmed by the figures ( 3e ) and ( 3c ) .",
    "compared with fig .",
    "( 3 g ) , the final condensate fraction is reduced a little bit , but not much , in particular for fig .",
    "( 3e ) with @xmath165 . finally , in fig .",
    "( 3a ) the variation is so fast ( @xmath166 ) that many of the eigenlevels of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) will be populated and we expect to have a poor final condensate fraction .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical simulation , where we can hardly see any considerable increase of the condensate fraction .    figures .",
    "( 3b ) ( 3d ) ( 3f ) and ( 3h ) show the evolution of the corresponding condensate mode which has the largest fraction of the atoms . for figs .",
    "( 3d ) ( 3f ) and ( 3h ) , we expect that the final state should be close to the lowest eigenstate of the operator @xmath167 .",
    "the corresponding condensate mode should be @xmath168 , with @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "indeed , we can see from these three figures that the parameters @xmath126 and @xmath122 approach their stationary values with very small oscillations as soon as @xmath18 becomes comparable to @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath171 , the system is well inside the josephson region .",
    "this means that a unique relative phase has been established between the two initial modes @xmath54 and @xmath55 when their coupling is still weak .",
    "in such a region , the two - mode model is still well justified , which supports the application of the two - mode model in understanding the establishment of the relative phase .",
    "the signature from fig .",
    "( 3b ) is less clear because the corresponding increase in the condensate fraction still remains to be small .          in this subsection",
    ", we investigate the merging of two condensates in a fock state with @xmath172 and in a coherent state @xmath173 with @xmath174 , respectively .",
    "this is motivated , on the one hand , by the consideration that the source for an operating atom laser resembles a coherent state ; and on the other hand , by the curiosity to find out the influence of the initial number fluctuations on the merging dynamics .",
    "a coherent state is certainly not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) at @xmath175 with @xmath79 , so we start from a superposition of a series of eigenlevels instead of a particular one .",
    "the simulation results are shown in figs .",
    "( 4a)-(4e ) for the evolutions of the largest condensate fraction @xmath150 and the corresponding parameters ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) , with the merging time varying from @xmath176 to @xmath177 .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to the ones displayed in fig .",
    "the main difference is that the final condensate fraction corresponding to the same time scale is notably worse now .",
    "this is understandable , as the initial state we start with is not an eigenstate of the governing hamiltonian and it has significant initial number fluctuation .",
    "the coherent state has number fluctuation on the order of @xmath68 , so from the analysis in sec .",
    "iic , we expect that the final condensate fraction may reduce by an amount of order @xmath178 , which is pretty close to the results shown in figs .",
    "( 4a)-(4e ) . in our simulation , the coherent state is not large due to the limitation of the computation efficiency ; @xmath123 is therefore not a small factor and we see considerable decrease in the condensate fraction . in more practical cases with @xmath124 ,",
    "the initial number fluctuation of each condensate should have a much smaller influence on the final condensate fraction .     .",
    "we have mentioned before that the merging dynamics is only determined by the rough time scale in the variations of @xmath17 and @xmath179 , rather than the explicit functional forms of these two parameters .",
    "we now verify this result by considering different merging methods .",
    "let us consider two cigar - shaped condensates ( with @xmath180 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) ) merged along the radial and the axial directions , respectively .",
    "the variations of @xmath17 and @xmath179 as functions of time are shown in fig .",
    "( 5a ) and ( 5b ) for these two cases . for merging along the axial direction , the evolutions of the largest condensate fraction @xmath150 and the corresponding mode parameters ( @xmath121,@xmath122 ) are shown in fig .",
    "( 5c ) and ( 5d ) with @xmath181 .",
    "compared with the corresponding results for merging along the radial direction , we see there is little difference in the final condensate fraction although the variations of @xmath17 and @xmath179 differ considerably in the two cases .",
    "this shows that what matters most for the merging dynamics is the rough time scale of @xmath129 and @xmath18 as we have mentioned before .",
    "it also justifies our use of the simple gaussian functions in eq .",
    "( 7 ) to model the individual condensate wave functions , as the functional details of @xmath129 and @xmath18 are not so important .",
    "this result should not be misunderstood as that it is equally good in real experiments to merge the condensates along the radial or the axial direction .",
    "experimentally , for the cigar - shaped condensates , it is much better to merge them along the radial direction @xcite .",
    "the reason is that we have assumed that the density profile of the atoms can adiabatically follow the movements of the traps to validate the two - mode model .",
    "although that is the case for merging along the radial direction , it will be much harder to meet this condition if the condensates are merged along the axial direction . in the latter case",
    ", one needs to have the condensates further away from each other initially to have negligible @xmath18 at the beginning ; one also needs to move the atoms significantly faster to have the same time scale for merging .",
    "however , the trap along the axial direction is much weaker , and a large fraction of the atoms could be excited during the merger . as a result , the atomic density profile would be left behind the movements of the traps unless one reduces the merging speed to an undesirable value ( for instance , with a time longer than the condensate life time ) .",
    "therefore , merging along the weaker trapping direction makes the individual condensate wave functions harder to follow adiabatically the movements of the traps , which would invalidate the two - mode approximation .",
    "nevertheless , if the two - mode approximation could be justified , the relative phase dynamics would then become insensitive to the detailed merging methods , as shown by this numerical simulation .",
    "using a two - mode model , we have studied the dynamics of relative phase and condensate fraction during the direct merging of two independently prepared condensates with random relative phase . in accordance with a recent experiment@xcite , we found that it is possible to create a single condensate with larger condensate fraction and a unique zero relative phase between the initial condensate modes . by examining the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian under the two - mode approximation",
    ", the process can be understood both within and without the adiabatic limit . in the ideal adiabatic limit",
    ", the result can be explained using the adiabatic theorem , and the system will evolve from a fragmented condensate to a single condensate following the evolution of the eigenstate of the hamiltonian during the merger . beyond the adiabatic limit , careful analysis of the evolution of the eigen - spectrum is needed .",
    "qualitatively , due to the quadratic scaling of the excitation energy with the energy levels , only the low - lying eigenstates of the hamiltonian will be populated even if the process is far from the adiabatic limit . at the end of the merger",
    ", the mixture of those low - lying states will give rise to the final state with dominant number of atoms in the desired single condensate mode .",
    "numerical simulations are then performed , and the results are in good agreement with our analysis .",
    "the results may have interesting implications for realization of a continuous atom laser based on direct merging of independently prepared condensates .",
    "because of the similarity of our model to the case of condensates in double wells or optical lattice , the adiabatic and non - adiabatic evolution picture described here may also find applications in controlling the dynamics of condensates in those optical potentials .",
    "we have assumed that the two traps are initially symmetric . in this case , the system is in a low - energy state only when @xmath182 .",
    "it is possible to generalize the results to the case where the initial two traps are asymmetric and @xmath183 for the low energy state .",
    "it is very hard to control the initial atom number of each condensate to be exactly the same ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "we assume there is a number flucation on the order of @xmath68 around this mean value , corresponding to the so - called shot - noise limit ."
