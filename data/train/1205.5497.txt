    "stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models are commonly used for solving a great variety of studies , from age / metallicity estimates in globular clusters to the reconstruction of the star formation history ( sfh ) in galaxies .",
    "the modeling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) emitted by evolving stellar populations requires at least three main ingredients : stellar evolutionary tracks , a spectral or photometric library with well - established atmospheric parameters for each library star , and an initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "a variety of models exists in the literature that differ in their treatment of each of these ingredients , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in particular , the adoption of the spectral library used to convert physical quantities in observed flux turned out to be critical in the comparison with observations .",
    "although theoretical libraries ( e.g. , @xcite ) are widely used among the most popular sps models @xcite because they are easier to handle , given the wide stellar parameter and spectral coverages and the arbitrary wavelength resolution , empirical - based libraries represent an advantage as the stars are real .",
    "the adoption of empirical spectra allows to overcome the uncertainties in the underlying model atmosphere calculations , giving more reliable predictions when compared with both spectroscopic @xcite and photometric @xcite data .    in vazdekis",
    "et al ( 2012 , hereafter paper i ) a library of single - burst stellar population model seds covering the spectral range 3500 - 9500  at moderately high resolution is presented . for building - up",
    "these models we combine three extensive empirical stellar spectral libraries , namely miles @xcite , indo - us @xcite and cat ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . here",
    "we focus on calibrating these models by comparing these new predictions to a variety of photometric data ranging from globular clusters ( gc ) to quiescent galaxies .",
    "broadband colours are among the simplest predictions of population synthesis models , thus comparing the model predictions to observed colours is the natural zeroth - order test of compatibility between models and observations .",
    "since gc are almost coeval and mono - metallic population of stars that closely resemble a single stellar population ( ssp ) , they are the ideal benchmark to test the accuracy of the models . on the other hand",
    ", quiescent galaxies can reach larger metallicities than the metallicity distribution of most globular cluster systems and allow us , with some caveats , to calibrate the models even in the high metallicity regime .",
    "although they can be modelled as an ssp as a first approximation , pieces of evidence of recent star formation in early - type galaxies have been found by different authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which indicate the need of more complex stellar populations to obtain better fits .",
    "moreover , galaxies may contain a certain amount of internal reddening that can further complicate the analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present a brief summary of the stellar population synthesis models presented in paper i. in section 3 we describe the webtool developed to download and handle these models . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we present the comparison of these models with globular cluster and galaxy data , respectively .",
    "section 7 summarizes our results . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the concordance cosmology : @xmath1=70 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the stellar population models we use throughout the paper have been presented in paper i , here we briefly summarize them .",
    "these models represent an extension of the @xcite models , based on the cat and miles empirical stellar spectral libraries .",
    "miles includes 985 stars covering the range @xmath4 3525 - 7500  @xcite with a spectral resolution of 2.5fwhm , ( falcn - barroso et al .",
    "the cat library @xcite consists of 706 stars in the range @xmath4 8350 - 9020   at resolution 1.5  . the indo - u.s .",
    "stellar library @xcite has also been added to fill - in the spectral range around 8000  that is not covered by the miles and cat libraries and to extend blueward and redward the wavelength coverage of the models . the indo - u.s .",
    "includes @xmath5 1200 stars with spectra that typically cover from 3465 to 9469  at resolution @xmath61.36 fwhm ( falcn - barroso et al . 2011 ) .",
    "although all the stars of the indo - u.s .",
    "library have been used to obtain an homogenized set of stellar parameters matching those of miles and cat libraries , only a subsample composed of 432 stars have been included to build - up the final miuscat catalogue to feed the models . only stars without gaps in the stellar spectra or significant telluric absorption residuals , among other reasons , were considered ( see paper i for details ) . as the flux - calibration quality of the indo - u.s .",
    "is not as accurate as in the other two libraries , a procedure was applied to correct the spectrum shape in the region @xmath4 @xmath5 7400 - 8350  to match the miles and cat stellar spectra . finally the indo - u.s .",
    "spectrum was used to extend the spectral range blueward the miles and redward the cat spectral ranges without applying any correction to the indo - u.s .",
    "spectrum . finally , the cat and indo - u.s .",
    "spectra were smoothed to match the resolution of miles , i.e. 2.5(fwhm ) .",
    "the miuscat stellar spectra were implemented in the models as described in @xcite and updated in falcn - barroso et al .",
    "finally the relevant spectral ranges of the resulting ssp seds were extracted and plugged to the original model seds computed on the basis of the miles and cat libraries . for the latter step a further correction , similar to that described above for the individual stellar spectra ,",
    "was applied to the model seds to obtain a unique spectrum , which is identical to the miles and cat based models in the corresponding spectral ranges , respectively .",
    "unlike miles ssp spectra , the new miuscat models allow us to measure from b to i broad - band filters and related colours .",
    "it is also possible to derive the u filter , which starts at @xmath5 3050    @xcite , by correcting for the missing flux blueward 3464.9  . for this purpose",
    "we make use of the fractions provided in paper i , which are obtained with the aid of the library of stellar spectra of @xcite ( @xmath4 1150 - 25000 ) . for each ssp",
    "the fractions obtained for the different stellar spectral types are integrated along the isochrone to obtain the corresponding missing flux for the ssp sed .",
    "finally the total u magnitude is derived by measuring the flux of the miuscat ssp spectrum through the u filter redward 3464.9   and correcting by the missing flux . to compare our model predictions to the observational data discussed in this paper we follow the same method to compute the sdss _",
    "u _ filter at two redshift values ( i.e. 0 and 0.04 ; see section 6 ) .",
    "the model predictions used in this work have been obtained with the aid of the webtool facilities that we provide in the miles website : http://miles.iac.es . the miles and cat stellar libraries and the stellar population synthesis models can be retrieved and handled according to the user requirements .",
    "the webtools include the transformation of the spectra to match the instrumental set - up of the observations ( spectral resolution and sampling ) , measurements of line - strength indices and synthetic magnitudes derived from the spectrum .    as in this work",
    "we apply the miuscat models to a large sample of galaxy data we describe in more detail another webtool facility that will be extensively used in section 6 .",
    "the tool returns the model spectrum corresponding to a given star formation history ( sfh ) , which can be either user - defined or follow some parametric description .",
    "the first case is devoted to handle with complex sfhs , with an arbitrary number of bursts .",
    "for instance , this case will be particularly useful for the sfhs retrieved from cosmological simulations . given the mass fraction and the metallicity at different ages , the tool computes the corresponding sed according to :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the number of input bursts , @xmath9 is the fraction of mass formed in the i - th bin and @xmath10 is the i - th ssp spectrum for a chosen imf . in the case that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not included in the age / metallicity grid of the models , the closest ssp model to the desired parameters",
    "is selected .",
    "thus no interpolation is performed on the ssp spectra .    for the parametric sfhs",
    "four different cases are allowed :    * multiple bursts : up to five bursts occurring at different ages and with different metallicities are summed up * truncated : the star formation rate ( sfr ) is assumed constant between the time of formation , @xmath13 , and the truncation time , @xmath14 ( all the times are referred to the present time ) * exponential : the sfh is modelled as a power - law rising term at early times plus an exponentially declining sfr : @xmath15 where @xmath13 is the time when star formation starts , @xmath16 is the e - folding time and @xmath17 parametrizes the power - law rising term at early times .",
    "* exponential plus bursts : up to five bursts can be added on top on the exponential sfr    as we will show in the following sections , the sfh webtool is particularly useful to construct galaxy seds , for which the use of complex stellar populations provide better fits than the ssp approach . in section 6",
    "several applications of the parametric sfh will be explored .",
    "here we use the catalogue of @xcite ( 2010 edition ) as a reference for the milky way ( mw ) globular clusters . the catalogue is a compilation of 150 clusters including the johnson - cousins ubvri photometry , [ fe / h ] metallicity and reddening e(b@xmath18v ) among other data .",
    "colours , except b@xmath18v , have been de - reddened using the extinction law of @xcite .",
    "figure [ gc_bvri ] shows the comparison of the optical broad - band colours of the gcs with the ones derived from the models .",
    "the model metallicity indicates the total abundance ratio [ z / h ] .",
    "a fit to the data points with a second order polynomial is indicated to guide the eye . in order to avoid clusters with uncertain photometry due to high extinction",
    ", we excluded the most reddened clusters with e(b@xmath18v ) @xmath190.5 ( open circles ) .",
    "the miuscat models are shown for ages of 10.0 and 12.6gyr for a kroupa universal imf .",
    "the use of a salpeter imf would leave the colours almost unaffected ( with differences smaller than 0.01 mag ) . to derive the synthetic colours we adopt the @xcite filter responses and vega magnitudes .",
    "the zero point has been set by using the @xcite spectrum of vega with a flux of @xmath20erg @xmath21s@xmath22@xmath22 at 5556(see falcon - barroso et al .",
    "2011 for further details on the computation of synthetic magnitudes ) .",
    "the colours of vega in the johnson - cousins filters are assumed to be u@xmath18b = u@xmath18v = b@xmath18v = v@xmath18r=0 mag , v@xmath18i=-0.04 mag .",
    "the black dotted line represents the photometric ssp model predictions computed by adopting temperature - gravity - metallicity relations from extensive photometric stellar libraries .",
    "the colour predictions resulting from these two approaches give very similar results ( with differences of the order of 0.01 - 0.02 mag ) showing the reliability of the flux - calibration of the model seds ( see paper i for more details ) .",
    "figure [ gc_bvri ] also shows that the models reproduce the observed colours fairly well . note that the v@xmath18i colour is particularly relevant to test the reliability of our models .",
    "this colour is heavily sensitive to the details of the method used to join the three libraries ( miles , indo - u.s . and cat ) .",
    "indeed , the v magnitude is entirely measured within the miles range , whereas the i filter response falls within the indo - u.s./cat range .",
    "the good match to the observed colours shows the robustness of the method and the flux - calibration of the miuscat seds .",
    "it is also remarkable the ability of our models to reproduce the b@xmath18v colour .",
    "this has been for a long time a problem for stellar population synthesis models . as quoted in previous works ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", ssp model seds tend to provide systematically redder b@xmath18v colour than the observed values ( @xmath50.05 mag ) .",
    "one of the reasons of these discrepancies may be ascribed to difficulties of the theoretically - based models in modeling the spectral energy distribution around @xmath23 5000 - 6000  , where the theoretical spectra predict a flux excess .",
    "the use of empirical libraries @xcite has proven to be effective at improving the match with colours of luminous red galaxies @xcite .",
    "likely , the use of empirical libraries with good flux - calibration quality and good parameter coverage , including the metal - poor regime , has allowed us to improve the matching of the gc colours in comparison to previous works .",
    "the improved match of the b@xmath18v vs [ z / h ] relation when using miles - based models instead of the stelib - kurucz library has been also shown in @xcite .    in figure [ gc_ubv ]",
    "we show the results obtained for the u@xmath18v and u@xmath18b colours .",
    "we found that colours involving the u band are significantly more difficult to reproduce .",
    "indeed , our models predict bluer colours ( @xmath50.1 mag in the high metallicity regime ) . as explained in sect .",
    "[ sect_u ] , the u magnitude is not fully derived from the miuscat seds , which do not extend to the blue end of the u filter response .",
    "the missing flux is accounted for with the aid of the @xcite stellar library .",
    "however we rule out this calibration as the a main source for the obtained discrepancy , as the obtained magnitudes following two different approaches ( the second one employing ssp model seds from other authors ) do agree within @xmath50.02 mag .",
    "moreover , even the photometric predictions show a similar level of disagreement with the data .",
    "a possible explanation may be linked to the various u filter response curves that can be adopted to reproduce the observations .",
    "figure [ gc_ubv ] shows the obtained results for various u filter responses , which differ from our reference filter ( @xcite ) .",
    "whereas for other johnson broad - band filters the adoption of different references for a given filter usually implies minor changes , in the case of the u filter , the exact definition of the curve makes a significant impact on the obtained colours .",
    "for instance , if we use the johnson ( 1965 ) response curve , we obtain a much better match .",
    "since it is difficult to trace back the compilation of data to recover which filter has been used for every gc , the u@xmath18v and u@xmath18b colours are subject to this source of uncertainty .",
    "+      +          in this section we compare our models with the globular clusters of m31 . for this purpose",
    "we use different photometric catalogs and metallicity estimates .",
    "we consider the spectroscopic metallicity determinations of @xcite , which is a compilation of various sources @xcite , the revised bologna catalog ( rbc ) , which are determined in a homogeneous manner @xcite and the spectroscopic catalog of @xcite , hereafter c11 .",
    "integrated colours in the johnson - cousins system have been taken from the rbc , while photometry in the sdss bands is from @xcite .",
    "the extinction in each band has been derived from the reddening values given in the corresponding catalog and the @xcite extinction law .",
    "given the higher uncertainty in the m31 measurements compared to the mw gcs , we only consider clusters with low extinction values ( e(b@xmath18v ) @xmath240.5 ) to avoid unreliable colour estimates . only globular clusters classified as old in the catalogs are considered .",
    "figure [ m31_j ] shows the johnson - cousins colours of the m31 gcs as a function of metallicity .",
    "given the high dispersion of the points we found that the polynomial fit is not a good description of the data .",
    "to guide the eye , we overplotted the median of the colours computed in intervals of metallicity and compare it to the fit to the mw gcs .",
    "we also show the model lines corresponding to the ssps with ages ranging from 6 to 12.6gyr ( kroupa universal imf ) .",
    "the vega system used to compute the synthetic magnitudes is the same as adopted for the mw data .",
    "the sdss colours in the ab system are shown in figure [ m31_sdss ] .",
    "note that the scatter obtained for the m31 data in these two figures is considerably larger than that observed in the mw clusters .",
    "moreover , as shown by the arrows , the m31 clusters display a considerable amount of reddening .",
    "although the absolute colours of m31 can be subject to several uncertainties , a robust result inferred from figures 3 is that the slope of the colour - metallicity relation is flatter in the m31 clusters . given that the mw slope is consistent with that of the old models , we argue that in m31 a significant age variations with metallicity is needed to account for the different slope . a flatter relation than that indicated from the models is also seen in figure 4 with sdss colours .",
    "old stellar populations in the lower metallicity regime and young ages for the metal rich clusters could explain such a trend .",
    "we obtain the worse fits to the data with the old models for the v@xmath18r and _ g@xmath18r _ colours .",
    "indeed , the m31 gc colours are in general bluer than their galactic counterparts , mainly in the high metallicity regime , as it can be inferred from comparing to the mw fit .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy at nearly solar metallicity may be linked to the fact that m31 clusters show higher metallicities than their mw counterparts ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in general the sdss colours , even for intermediate metallicities , are matched better with younger models .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that the choice of the catalog may change our conclusion .",
    "in fact young models are required to fit the trend in the _ g@xmath18r _ colour of @xcite dataset , whereas models of 6 - 8gyr provide a fair match for all the colours of the rbc and c11 catalogs . from the comparison with our model lines",
    "the best match to the data is obtained combining old models at lower metallicities and younger models at the high metallicity regime .    in @xcite the synthetic _",
    "g@xmath18r _ colour derived from the models of @xcite has been compared to the sdss colours of m31 clusters in a similar way as it is done here .",
    "since the _ g@xmath18r _ colour falls in the miles range , it coincides with the predictions of the miuscat models presented here . in @xcite paper",
    "the @xcite colours turned out to be offset by @xmath50.1 mag at solar metallicity with respect to m31 gc colours .",
    "although for the oldest model considered here we find similar difference in colour , by using different colours and different photometric systems we conclude that the data can be matched by considering younger models than those in @xcite . finally , as we obtain with the old models very good fits to the mw clusters , which have more reliable data , and",
    "since the m31 cluster colours in the same photometric bands differ from the ones of the mw , we can conclude that we require younger models , at least in the high metallicity regime , to fit the data .",
    "+      +         our results agree with evidences supporting that metal - rich gcs tend to be younger than the more metal - poor clusters , at least in the mw ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it has been claimed that the gcs of m31 tend to be on average younger than their galactic counterparts @xcite , though this result is yet to be conclusive .",
    "spectroscopic ages for the high - metallicity m31 clusters have been derived in c11 . in the low - metallicity regime",
    "the authors could not get accurate age determination , as these clusters are contaminated by blue hb stars , hence we can not test the age variation with metallicity . for the high - metallicity clusters in our sample ( [ z / h]@xmath25 ) the c11 determinations give a mean age of 11.3 gyr , that apparently contradicts the young nature of the m31 clusters .",
    "note however that these authors employed the balmer absorption line indices as age indicators and it is well known that this method can give very uncertain absolute ages , even larger than the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "moreover , the models of @xcite used in c11 give broad - band colours in excellent agreement with our values .",
    "for instance , a solar metallicity model with age of 11.2 gyr has a b@xmath18v colours of 0.978 mag , very similar to b@xmath18v@xmath260.977 mag that we obtain for the miles models .",
    "both photometric predictions are much larger than the m31 colours ( figure [ m31_j ] ) , confirming the discrepancy between the spectroscopic and photometric age measurements .    furthermore , given the high uncertainties involved in the extinction , even our results should be taken with caution .",
    "indeed , the parameter that varies mostly among the three catalogs is the reddening .",
    "the c11 estimates tend to be biased towards larger values than the other two catalogs , leading to bluer de - reddened clusters ( see for instance the g@xmath18r colour in figure [ m31_sdss ] ) . in c11",
    "the quoted uncertainties for the @xmath27 is 0.1 mag , hence of the order of colour variations due to different ages .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to draw robust conclusions .",
    "in this section we consider the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample of @xcite , for which typically the definition of early - type galaxy ( etg ) also applies .",
    "the lrg sample has been extracted from the sdss spectroscopic galaxy survey ( data release 7 , @xcite ) , by selecting galaxies with the galaxy_red flag in the sdss database .",
    "lrgs constitute a uniform sample of objects with the reddest rest - frame colours , selected with cuts in the ( _ g@xmath18r , r@xmath18i , r _ ) colour - colour - magnitude cube ( see @xcite ) . to obtain the same galaxy population at different redshifts ,",
    "the lrg sample has been selected using two different selection criteria below and above z=0.4 , as the balmer break moves from the _ g _ band to the _ r _ band at this redshift . to increase the redshift range , galaxies from the 2df sdss lrg and quasar ( 2slaq ) survey @xcite",
    "have been also included ( @xmath515000 objects ) and they contribute to the high redshift tail of the redshift distribution ( see figure [ zdistr_lrg ] ) . by restricting the sample to galaxies with reliable redshift determination ( zwarning@xmath260 ) we end up with @xmath5170000 galaxies .",
    "the sdss database provides a variety of measured magnitudes for each detected object . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use dereddened model magnitudes because they provide an unbiased colour estimate in the absence of colour gradients @xcite .",
    "previous works @xcite have highlighted the difficulties of stellar population models in reproducing the colour evolution in observed frame of lrg at intermediate redshift ( @xmath28 ) , with the prediction of too red colours in the _ g@xmath18r _ and too blue in the _ r@xmath18i _ for the lowest redshift lrgs , while the opposite effect is observed for the highest redshift lrgs .",
    "similar disagreements have been reported for red sequence colours in galaxy clusters at similar redshifts @xcite .",
    "+     +    in figure [ col1_z ] we compare the predictions from the miuscat models to the colour evolution of the lrg sample .",
    "according to the fiducial model for the formation of lrg , in the simplest case we assume that they formed in a uniform burst at high redshift ( z@xmath265 ) and evolve passively thereon .",
    "solar metallicity and kroupa universal imf are assumed .",
    "the observed colours are reproduced by shifting the model spectra to the corresponding redshift and taking into account the ageing effect .",
    "synthetic colours in the sdss filters have been computed in the ab system @xcite . for consistency ,",
    "the observed colours from the sdss database have been transformed to ab system by applying the relative shifts : @xmath29 mag ; @xmath30 mag .",
    "the model predictions are shown for the redshift interval where the miuscat spectra cover the _ r@xmath18i _ and _ i@xmath18z _ colours .",
    "filter falls outside the measurable range at z@xmath260.05 , thus colours containing _ u _ and _ g _ are not shown .",
    "we see that the simplest model is able to reproduce the observed distribution at low redshift in both colours .",
    "the model starts to deviate from the median colours at z@xmath60.4 , producing too red colours .    in figure [ col1_z ]",
    "it is represented also a second model , where a small fraction of the mass ( 5% ) is contributed by a metal - poor population ( [ z / h]@xmath26 - 2.32 ) .",
    "it is expected @xcite that galaxies exhibit some spread in the metallicity distribution with a contribution also from metal - poor stars . the effect of including stars with such a low metallicity is to bluen the colours , with the result of loosing the match with the observed distribution in the lowest redshift range , but improving it at high redshift .",
    "it is worth to say that the differences between this model and the median of observed colour is only @xmath5 0.02 mag .",
    "the uncertainties derived from the zero - point calibration of the sdss system ( 0.01 mag ) and from the choice of the imf ( 0.01 mag of difference between salpeter and kroupa universal ) could also account for this difference .",
    "hence , it turns out to be difficult to discriminate among these two possibilities .",
    "nevertheless , in both cases the miuscat models perform rather well , confirming the results of @xcite , according to which models constructed with empirical stellar libraries provide a good fit to the lrg colour distribution .",
    "although the lrg sample has been selected to follow a passive evolution model ( see @xcite ) , this does not guarantee that all the galaxies accomplishing the selection criteria follow this model .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that a non negligible fraction of lrgs does not evolve passively in a dynamical sense .",
    "they can undergo mergers and the sample can be contaminated with galaxies that belong to the lrg sample for a short period of time . however , the brightest tail of the sample turns out to be coeval ( i.e. with almost no merging ) for galaxies in the redshift range : 0.22 - 0.45 . for this reason , in the bottom panels of figure [ col1_z ]",
    "we compare our passive evolution models with these bright galaxies ( @xmath31 -23 mag ) . for this subsample ,",
    "the high - redshift galaxies are truly the progenitors of the low - redshift ones . in the redshift range where the galaxies appear coeval",
    ", our passive model performs remarkably well .",
    "0.04 , which includes 370 objects . ]",
    "a further insight into the capabilities of the models can be obtained by comparing them to a sample of nearby galaxies , for which we can use three different colours as constraints . for this purpose",
    "we select a homogeneous sample in the local universe with a large number of sdss galaxies with visual morphological classification @xcite .",
    "we select a subsample of early - type galaxies ( morphological type @xmath32 ) with reliable redshift measurements .",
    "we further restrict our sample to a narrow redshift slice , @xmath33 , to end up with 370 targets .",
    "this choice of redshift is motivated by two main reasons .",
    "first , at this redshift the number of galaxies peaks ( see figure [ zdistr ] ) .",
    "second , given the limited spectral coverage of the miuscat models in the blue end , the correction factors we need to apply to measure the sdss _ u _ magnitude become too large for redshifts above this value , as the wavelengths at which the _ u _ filter response peaks start to fall outside the spectral range of the models ( see paper i ) . before comparing the colours derived from the miuscat seds ,",
    "once redshifted to z@xmath260.04 , we have tested that the selected redshift interval is small enough that colour differences due only to variation in redshift within such interval are negligible ( @xmath340.01 mag ) .    as for the photometric estimates , we rely on the model magnitudes from the dr7 catalog .",
    "it is worth noticing that all the colours involved in this study belong to the optical spectral range , which are known to be heavily affected by the age / metallicity degeneracy , irrespective of the colour - colour diagnostic diagram in use .",
    "therefore the results obtained in this section are not intended to provide a well - constrained picture for the stellar populations of these galaxies , which might require a deeper analysis involving colours in other wavelengths and/or spectra .    in figure [ etg_ssp ]",
    "we show the colour distribution of the etg sample compared to the miuscat ssp models with ages ranging from 3 to 14gyr for three metallicity values : [ z / h]@xmath26 - 0.4 , 0 and 0.22 .",
    "we also include an arrow indicating the effect of internal dust extinction on the observed colours .",
    "we assume @xmath35 mag , in agreement with the typical value derived for low redshift lrg @xcite .",
    "the de - reddening in the various sdss bands has been computed with the extinction law : @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we see that none of the ssp models is able to match the observed colour distribution .",
    "although the fiducial model for the formation of etgs predicts that they form in a uniform burst at high redshift with high metallicity , the old models tend to produce too red colours in the _",
    "g@xmath18r _ vs _ u@xmath18 g _ plot . on the contrary ,",
    "the _ r@xmath18i _ colours turn out to be too blue with respect to the real galaxies . hence",
    ", this simple picture does not seems to appropriate to describe the stellar populations of this galaxy sample .",
    "the miuscat models adopt the stellar isochrones of @xcite ( i.e. padova 2000 ) , as described in paper i. it has been claimed that these tracks provide blue colours for old elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite claimed that models computed with the isochrones of @xcite ( i.e. padova 1994 ) are preferred because redder v - k colours are predicted , in better agreement with the observations .",

    "we switch for the first time to the combination of more than two stellar populations . in sections",
    "[ sect_mp ] and  [ sect_age ] we have seen that the combination of an old metal - rich stellar population with a small fraction of either a metal - poor or a young component has significant effects on the resulting colour - colour plots .",
    "furthermore in section  [ sect_imf ] we tested the effects on the colours from non standard imfs .",
    "in fact , very recently @xcite showed spectroscopic evidences pointing towards steeper imfs in massive galaxies , in agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it is worth to test the colours that result from combining all these stellar populations .",
    "an example of such scenario is the one derived in @xcite from the best fits to both broad - band colours ( from @xmath38 to @xmath39 ) and the lick line - strength indices , of a number of prototype massive galaxies , employing a full chemo - evolutionary version of our models @xcite .    in this scenario",
    "the imf varies with time , being skewed towards high - mass stars during an initial short period of time ( @xmath340.5gyr ) that quickly enriches the interstellar medium and , afterwards , the imf becomes even steeper than the salpeter one .",
    "this is reproduced with a multiple bursts model by adding on top of the main episode of star formation , that forms 87% of the mass , two populations . in the first population 10 % of the mass formed at 14gyr with a top - heavy imf ( slope @xmath40=0.8 ) .",
    "half of the mass formed in this burst is associated with a metal - poor component , [ z / h]=-2.32 dex ( as in section  [ sect_mp ] ) , and the other half has subsolar composition ( [ z / h]=-0.4 ) .",
    "another 3% of the mass is formed at the age of 1gyr ( as in [ sect_age ] ) .",

    "a bimodal imf is assumed for all these models .",
    "the adoption of the imf with slope 2.3 in the main burst is consistent with recent evidences for a steep imf in massive galaxies @xcite .    .",

    "colour , which remains too blue .",
    "although quite unlikely , part of this discrepancy can also be attributed to internal extinction , leading too red colours that we can not fit with dust - free models .      in order to explore all the possible combinations of sfhs that can match the two colour - colour distributions we have run a set of montecarlo simulations , where we allow all the stellar population parameters to vary : age , metallicity and imf slope .",
    "we only consider seven representative imf slopes : 0.3 , 0.8 , 1.3 , 1.8 , 2.3 , 2.8 and 3.3 .",
    "to keep the case as general as possible we use three bursts , where the fraction of mass involved in each of the burst is also a free parameter .",
    "figure  [ etg_mc ] shows the results for 100000 simulations .",
    "on one hand we see that the cloud of models does not properly match the observed galaxy distribution in the _",

    "the cloud of models matches the region enclosed by data in the _",

    "which kind of ssp mixtures most likely resemble the data we selected the closest 1700 points to the median of the observed colours in each of the distributions . among these combinations",
    "we only choose those that are common to these two distributions to end up with 26 models , whose sfhs are shown in the appendix .",
    "we have ordered all these models following an increasing contribution of young stellar populations , i.e. , with ages smaller than 5gyr .",
    "we see that a large number of models require very important contributions from ssps with old ages , high metallicity ( solar or higher ) and imf slopes steeper than salpeter ( i.e. @xmath41 ) .",
    "all these models require smaller , but not negligible , contributions from young or / and metal - poor stellar populations . finally ssps with slopes lower than the salpeter value",
    "seem to be required for a number of models .",
    "a mean solution for these models can therefore be summarized as mainly composed of metal - rich and dwarf - dominated stellar populations with much smaller contributions from young or metal - poor components .",
    "interestingly the scenario discussed in section  [ sect_chemo ] would be a good representative of this mean trend of solutions .",
    "in fact we nearly recover it in the models shown in the first and second rows of panels of figure  [ sfh ] .",
    "whereas many studies support the presence of old ages and metal - rich stellar populations in massive galaxies ( see for example the review of @xcite ) , the requirement of non standard imfs is a matter of debate as recently pointed out by @xcite . among our solutions ,",
    "the steeper imf slopes are recovered for the highest metallicity objects . in figure  [ mu_met ]",
    "we show the mass weighted mean imf slope as a function of the mass weighted mean metallicity for the 26 solutions .",
    "the existence of a imf slope - metallicity relation has already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the linear fit to the simulated points lies close to the relation derived by the above authors by means of near - ir imf sensitive spectral features .",
    "it is worth to note that , using completely independent diagnostic techniques , it is inferred a similar imf - metallicity relationship in the sense that larger metallicities correspond to larger effective imf slopes .",
    "there are a number of models that depart significantly from the mean trend depicted above ( see last rows of figure  [ sfh ] ) .",
    "these models require important contributions from stellar populations with ages smaller than @xmath65gyr .",
    "however we also see that most of these models also require steeper imf slopes than the models that are clearly dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the colours redden with increasing age , metallicity or imf slope as shown in paper  i. such degeneracy between these three parameters for the optical colours does not allow us to provide a unique solution . to constrain the solutions",
    "it is required to use spectroscopic data or / and colours in other spectral ranges ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however it is worth recalling that none of the sfhs explored in the simulations provide satisfactory fits to these two observed colour - colour distributions .",
    "indeed , the departure of the models from the median of the observed colours is non negligible , with the @xmath42 colour showing the largest residuals .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to recover the sfhs of the sdss early - type galaxy sample , but the fact that in these complex models we allow to vary all , the age , metallicity and imf slope of the ssps , without reaching a fully satisfactory solution , supports the need for a fourth parameter to be taken into account in the models .",
    "we consider such a possibility in the next section .           as explained in paper  i the miuscat ssp seds employed here are computed on the basis of scaled - solar isochrones and stellar spectra with nearly scaled - solar abundance ratios for the high metallicity regime that is required to fit massive galaxies .",
    "however , it is well known that the spectra of these galaxies show an enhancement in [ mg / fe ] . to assess the effects of @xmath43-enhanced element partitions on the ssp colours we correct them , in a differential way , with the aid of the models of @xcite .",
    "these fully theoretical models are constructed on the basis of a high resolution library of synthetic spectra @xcite , where all the @xmath43 elements , including magnesium , are enhanced with respect to iron with the same proportion , i.e. , [ @xmath43/fe]=0.4 .",
    "we correct our miuscat ssp colours with the difference in colour obtained from the scaled - solar and @xmath43-enhanced models of @xcite , keeping constant the iron abundance .",
    "the corrected ssp colours are shown for different metallicities in figure [ etg_alpha ] .",
    "interestingly , the effect of @xmath43-enhancement tends to bluen the _",
    "u@xmath18 g _ and _ g@xmath18r _ colours and to redden _ r@xmath18i _ , as required by the data .",
    "note that although this effect is relatively modest it certainly goes in the right direction for improving our fits to the most massive galaxies of our sample .",
    "preliminary tests performed with our own version of the models constructed with @xmath43-enhanced mixtures based on the miles library , making use of the [ mg / fe ] determinations of @xcite , lead to even larger differences with respect to the scaled - solar predictions in the same directions as with the models of @xcite .",
    "in the present work we have explored the constraints on the miuscat models provided by photometric data of globular clusters and quiescent galaxies . in paper",
    "i we have presented the new models and described the improvements . here , we have focused on the comparison of the model predictions with broad - band photometry .    the integrated colours of mw globular clusters can be remarkably reproduced by the miuscat models in all the visible bands .",
    "only colours involving the u filter can not be used to constrain the models , as the uncertainty relative to the filter response used to reproduce the u magnitude is too high .",
    "the ability of our models for matching the colours of the mw stellar clusters in the other bands is remarkable . in particular",
    ", the b@xmath18v colour has always challenged models based on theoretical stellar libraries , which fail at matching the range covered by the @xmath44 filter .",
    "here we have shown that the problem can be solved by the use of empirical stellar libraries ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison with m31 globular clusters is less straightforward but it allows us to test the models even in the region of solar metallicity .",
    "the comparison with our models suggests that the m31 globular clusters are on average younger than usually assumed for the mw globular clusters .",
    "although an old model ( 12.6 gyr ) can fit the metal - poor clusters , we need ages in the range 6 - 10gyr to match the colours of the clusters with high metallicities .",
    "the spectral coverage of the miuscat library allows us to test here the models in several bands and , by relaxing the assumption that all the m31 gc are old , we can obtain a good fit to the data if we assume that metal - rich m31 clusters are younger than metal - poor ones .",
    "the fact that in mw clusters we do not need young models may be ascribed to the lack of metal - rich clusters .",
    "therefore our results disagree with previous works @xcite claiming that the _ g@xmath18r _ colours of m31 globular clusters could not be matched accurately with our models .",
    "nevertheless , the large amount of extinction in these clusters makes their colours very uncertain and not suitable for calibration purposes .",
    "when the models are compared to the colour evolution of lrgs , under the assumption of a passive evolution model , the observed colours are fairly reproduced .",
    "both , a simple model where stars formed in a single burst at high redshift , and a model that includes a small component of metal - poor stars , can be used to fit the observed distribution with increasing redshift . however , in the high redshift interval ( z @xmath45 0.4 ) where the observed colours probe the rest - frame _ g@xmath18r _ , the models predict redder colours than the median distribution .",
    "although the colour evolution of the lrgs can be fairly described within the fiducial model of purely passive stellar evolution , the combination of three colours , _",
    "u@xmath18 g _ , _ g@xmath18r _ , _ r@xmath18i _ , poses a challenge .",
    "we find that the colour - colour diagrams based on these colours allow us to discriminate among different models .",
    "given the wavelength coverage of the miuscat models , we restrict our study to a limited redshift range , at z@xmath230.04 , where we can measure all these three colours .",
    "our study shows that single - burst models do not provide a good description for the local population of quiescent galaxies .",
    "irrespective of their metallicity , the old ssps provide too red _",
    "u@xmath18 g _ and _ g@xmath18r _ colours and too blue _ r@xmath18i _ colour .",
    "we also find that the ssp model predictions from different authors do not match these colour - colour distributions .",
    "such disagreement has also been shown by @xcite .",
    "we note that the use of only two colours , _",
    "u@xmath18 g _ and _ g@xmath18r _ does not allow to highlight the problem in the _ r@xmath18i _",
    "colour , which goes in the opposite direction . nonetheless , an important result drawn from such a comparison is that models based on empirical stellar libraries ( miuscat ; @xcite ) predict colours much closer to the observed distribution than models based on theoretical spectra @xcite .",
    "we rule out that the inability of the miuscat ssp models for providing fully satisfactory fits to the colours of lrgs is due to flux - calibration issues .",
    "as shown in paper  i , the miuscat spectra provide colours with photometric uncertainties @xmath46 0.02 mag .",
    "furthermore , the colours of our models are in good agreement with globular cluster data .",
    "we have tested the hypothesis that quiescent galaxies formed their stars in a strong burst at high redshift .",
    "our study based on the _",
    "u@xmath18 g _ vs. _ g@xmath18r _ and _ r@xmath18i _ vs. _ g@xmath18r _ colour - colour diagrams suggest that the constituent stellar populations of local etgs are not necessarily fully coeval and old , and might require small contributions from either young or / and metal - poor stellar populations .",
    "we have explored several models with such complex stellar populations .",
    "we find that these smaller contributions are very effective at bluening the colours and matching the distribution in the _",
    "u@xmath18 g _ and _ g@xmath18r _ colours .",
    "note however that the resulting _ r@xmath18i _ colour is too blue .",
    "the chemo - evolutionary model shown in @xcite provides one of the best fits to these two colour - colour diagrams .",
    "apart from the inclusion of a metal - poor population at early - times and a small burst at 1gyr , this model adopts a variable imf scenario . in this model the first generation of stars is skewed toward high - mass ( top - heavy imf ) , while at later times stars formed with a steeper imf slope .",
    "the adoption of such a steep imf is the main reason for the improvement also in the _ r@xmath18i _ colour .",
    "although this model is just one among several possible solutions , it clearly shows the need for a more complex sfh than the single burst model to explain the formation of etgs .",
    "moreover , the finding that quiescent galaxies have experienced a small amount of recent star formation is not new and has been revealed by several observational evidences @xcite and predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation @xcite . however , it is worth noting that although the colours obtained from these complex models are approaching the observed values , the agreement is not satisfactory .",
    "an experiment done by simulating three - burst montecarlo sfhs confirmed the impossibility of the three model parameters ( age , metallicity and imf slope ) to fairly match the color plane _ g@xmath18r _ vs _",
    "u@xmath18g_. we are aware of the degeneracies affecting the optical colours , which do not allow us to properly constrain the solutions .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to fully constrain the sfhs , for which spectroscopic data or colors in other spectral range would be required , but the inability of these simulations to reproduce the observed colours suggests the need of another parameter to model the observations .",
    "we have identified that the inclusion of @xmath43-enhancement improves the fits .",
    "a limitation of the models based on empirical libraries is that they rely on stars from the solar neighborhood , which , most likely , has experienced a chemical enrichment that differs from that of massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "indeed , it is now well established that massive early - type galaxies are enhanced in magnesium with respect to iron , showing @xmath47 \\simeq 0.2 $ ] @xcite .",
    "we have estimated the effect of @xmath43-enhanced models on these colours by applying differential corrections derived from the models of @xcite predictions on the miuscat colours .",
    "the overall effect is in the direction of improving the fits to the observations , as the colours in the bluer bands become bluer whereas the _ r@xmath18i _ tends to redden .",
    "therefore , the combination of both effects , a more complex sfh and the inclusion in the models of abundance ratios in agreement with the observations should provide better fits .",
    "we conclude that the impact of @xmath43-enhancement on the colours of massive galaxies can not be neglected to properly reproduce the observations .",
    "our forthcoming models taking into account the @xmath43-enhanced mixture of miles stars will clarify this issue .",

    "in this section we show the sfhs of the best solutions found in the montecarlo simulations described in section  [ sect_mc ] .",
    "we selected the 1700 closest points to the median of the observed colours in each of the colour - colour plots .",
    "then we only considered the solutions that satisfy both distributions , ending up with 26 models , whose sfhs are shown in figure  [ sfh ] .",
    "the sfhs are ordered according to an increasing fraction of mass in bursts younger than 5gyr ( the first panels show the solutions with the smaller fractions ) .",
    "the resulting sfhs can be divided into two broad categories . in the first group we can identify sfhs dominated by an old , metal - rich population , enriched with dwarf stars ( high imf slopes ) . on top of the old populations , we find small contributions from young populations . in some cases",
    "we do not see any significant young component . in these cases ,",
    "g@xmath18r _ and _ u@xmath18 g _ colours result from the contribution of a metal - poor population ( see also section [ sect_mp ] ) .",
    "the other group of solutions includes sfhs with an important component of young populations ( @xmath24 5 gyr ) . in some cases",
    ", the fraction of mass formed in the youngest burst can be as large as 80% ( see sfh in the last row ) . as already shown in section [ sect_age ] ,",
    "the age is the dominant parameter at decreasing both the _ g@xmath18r _ and _ u@xmath18 g _ colours and , thus , it provides a good match of the _",
    "g@xmath18r _ vs _ u@xmath18 g _ plot .",
    "the sfhs with the largest component of young stellar populations also show the steepest imf slopes , which are needed in order to redden the _ r@xmath18i _ colour .",
    "this confirms the results found in sections 6.1 , 6.2 and 6.3 , where we have illustrated how the imf is mainly affecting the _ r@xmath18i _ while age and metallicity variations are needed to match the _",
    "g@xmath18r _ vs _ u@xmath18 g _ colour distribution .    given the age / metallicity / imf degeneracies affecting the optical colours ,",
    "the two kind of sfhs produce similar colours and , hence , lead to the same level of agreement with the observed colour - colour distributions .",
    "there are many observational evidences , from spectroscopic and photometric studies favouring the first group of solutions for the formation of massive galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , galaxies that formed a considerable amount of stars very recently , as in the second group , would show strong @xmath48 absorption in the spectra that are not observed in the local population of massive ellipticals ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , within the first group of models we can identify a number of solutions that resemble the ones found in section [ sect_chemo ] .",
    "a small burst at early times occurring with a flat imf and metal - poor stars is followed by a strong burst at nearly solar metallicity and steeper imf and then by a small burst at later times ( see first and second rows ) ."
