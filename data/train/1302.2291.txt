    "the holographic principle says that the number of degrees of freedom in a bounded system should be finite and has relations with the area of its boundary @xcite . by applying the so - called holographic principle to cosmology ,",
    "one derives a relation between vacuum density and a cosmological scale @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath7 is a numerical constant and @xmath8 is the reduced planck mass @xmath9 .",
    "the obtained vacuum energy , dubbed as holographic dark energy ( hde ) , can push our universe into an accelerated expansion phase at late time @xcite . by taking different cosmological scale , for example",
    "the hubble horizon @xcite , the event horizon or the particle horizon @xcite as discussed by @xcite and the ricci scalar @xcite , one has different hde model .",
    "based on the idea that gravity as an entropic force @xcite , a similar de density was given in @xcite where a linear combination of @xmath10 and @xmath11 was also presented , see also @xcite .",
    "furthermore generalized hde models @xmath12 and @xmath13 were also presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the _ typical _ hde model where the future event horizon @xmath14 is taken as a large cosmological scale , i.e. the ir cut - off @xmath15 .",
    "this horizon is the boundary of the volume a fixed observer may eventually observe .",
    "this model has been confronted by cosmic observations extensively @xcite , for recent results , please see @xcite and @xcite . in the literature , to the best of our knowledge , only the geometry information which includes the luminosity distance @xmath16 from sn ia , the angular diameter distance @xmath17 from bao and the full information of cmb from wmap-7yr were used to constrain this model , for examples please see @xcite and @xcite . as is well known , to discriminate the cosmological models the geometry information is not enough due to the degeneracies between model parameters .",
    "it means that different cosmological models can have the same background evolution history .",
    "however the dynamical evolution would be very different even if they have the same background evolution . which is to say the dynamical evolution is important to break the possible degeneracy .",
    "thanks to the measurement of the cosmic growth rate via the redshift - space distortion ( rsd ) which relates to the evolutionary speed of matter density contrast , now one can constrain the evolutions of the density contrast @xmath18 through @xmath0 , where @xmath19 is the growth rate of matter and @xmath20 is the rms amplitude of the density contrast at the comoving @xmath21 mpc scale . here",
    "@xmath22 is the normalized hubble parameter @xmath23 .",
    "here we should notice that the growth rate of structure @xmath24 has been used to constrain the dark energy model and to investigate the growth index in the literature , see @xcite for examples .",
    "however , the observed values of the growth rate @xmath25 are derived from the redshift space distortion parameter @xmath26 and the linear bias @xmath27 , where a particular fiducial @xmath28cdm model is used .",
    "it means that the current @xmath29 data can only be used to test the consistency of @xmath28cdm model .",
    "this is the weak point of using @xmath29 data points .",
    "moreover , the measurements of the linear growth rate are degenerate with the bias @xmath30 or clustering amplitude in the power spectra . to remove this weakness , song & percival proposed to use @xmath31 which is almost model independent and provides good test to dark energy models even without the knowledge of the bias or @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "recently , the observed values of @xmath0 were provided by the 2dfgrs @xcite , wigglez @xcite , sdss lrg @xcite , boss @xcite , and 6dfgrs @xcite .",
    "the latest rsd data points were also summarized in @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we show the data points used in this paper in table [ table : fs8data ] , see also table 1 of ref .",
