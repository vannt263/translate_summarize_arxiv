    "for studying the high energy radiation of pulsars , two major mechanisms are used : the synchrotron process @xcite and the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of identification of a location , where the radiation comes from still is a matter of discussion . for solving this problem an approach of the so - called polar cap model",
    "was proposed @xcite . according to this model , due to very strong electrostatic field",
    ", particles are uprooted from the star s surface layer and accelerate along the magnetic field lines @xcite inside a zone where the electric field is nonzero ( gap ) .",
    "this process leads to relativistic energies of electrons , which in turn , create radiation .",
    "unfortunately , the particle energy inventory accumulated within the gap is not enough to explain the observed high energy emission . for solving this problem , to enlarge somehow the gap zone , series of works have been invoked .",
    "@xcite have considered an effect of rectifying the curved magnetic field lines and they have shown that this process leads to an increase of the gap size . @xcite have applied the method developed by @xcite for studying the high altitude emission from the pulsar slot gaps .",
    "a three - dimensional model of optical and @xmath2-ray emission from the slot gap accelerator was examined and it has been predicted that the emission below @xmath3 must exhibit correlations in time and phase with the radio band",
    ". somewhat different mechanism leading to the effect of the gap size increase was proposed by @xcite where the intermediate formation of positronium ( electron - positron bound state ) was studied .",
    "generally speaking , the space - time close to neutron star s surface is slightly curved . based on this fact ,",
    "@xcite have considered an effect of creation od an additional electric field due to the influence of the kerr metric .",
    "all aforementioned mechanisms can not provide a significant increase of the gap size to explain the observed high energy radiation from pulsars . to solve this problem ,",
    "the so - called outer gap model has been proposed [ see for example @xcite ] . according to this approach radiation",
    "is formed further out in the magnetosphere of pulsars and mechanisms responsible for emission are : the synchrotron , inverse compton and curvature radiation processes respectively .",
    "recently , magic cherenkov telescope has detected from the crab pulsar the vhe pulsed emission above @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the most peculiar feature of the observed radiation is coincidence of the high energy and optical signals @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the polar cap models can not be applied for explaining the magic observational data . in @xcite",
    "we have examined the crab pulsar s recently observed vhe pulsed emission data .",
    "it is worth noting that due to very small cooling timescales , particles rapidly transit to the ground landau state completely killing the subsequent radiation .",
    "we have found that due to the cyclotron instability , the optical spectrum is generated , which in turn via the quasi - linear diffusion provokes the increase of the pitch angles , leading to the synchrotron process with the spectral index @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown that the emission in the optical and high energy ( @xmath0 ) bands originate from the well localized regions , leading to the observational fact that the signals peak with the same phases .",
    "as we have already noted , the analysis of the observational data indicates that the curvature radiation and the inverse compton mechanism must be excluded from the possible emission mechanisms . generally speaking ,",
    "for very strong corotating magnetic fields , the particles a ) move along curved trajectories and b ) accelerate up to relativistic energies .",
    "therefore , it is of great importance to understand why the curvature radiation and the ics are not involved in the process of emission .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider the synchrotron , inverse compton and curvature radiation mechanisms , in sect .",
    "3 we present our results and in sect .",
    "4 we summarize them .",
    "in this section we are gong to consider three major emission mechanisms : the synchrotron process , the ics and the curvature radiation respectively .",
    "as we have already mentioned , timescales of transit of particles to the ground landau state is very small and electrons very soon start moving along the magnetic field lines without emission . @xcite",
    "have found that the situation changes due to the cyclotron instability , leading to creation of nonzero pitch angles and the corresponding radiation process . the method developed in ( @xcite )",
    "was applied by us in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the quasi - linear duffusion excites the transverse and longitudinal - transverse waves : @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the modulus of the wave vector , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the wave vector s longitudinal ( parallel to the magnetic field ) and transverse ( perpendicular to the magnetic field ) components respectively , @xmath10 is the speed of light and @xmath11 were , @xmath12 is the plasma frequency , @xmath13 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are electron s charge and the rest mass respectively and @xmath16 is the plasma density . according to a model developed by @xcite , we consider the plasma composed of two components : a ) the plasma component with the lorentz factor , @xmath17 and b ) the beam component with the lorentz factor , @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite have shown that the aforementioned modes generate if the cyclotron resonance regime @xmath19 takes place .",
    "@xmath20 is the drift velocity , @xmath21 is the longitudinal velocity component and @xmath22 is the curvature radius of field lines .    for the parameters of the crab pulsar , @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , from eqs .",
    "( [ disp1]-[cycl ] ) one can show that the development of the cyclotron instability occurs in the optical band ( @xmath28 ) close to the light cylinder zone .",
    "@xmath29 denotes the pulsar s period , @xmath30 - its radius , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the plasma density and the magnetic field induction respectively , close to the star .    when electrons emit in the synchrotron regime , they experience the so - called radiative forces @xcite : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the pitch angle .",
    "these forces try to decrease the pitch angle contrary to the quasi - linear diffusion , which tends to widen the value of @xmath35 .",
    "the dynamical process saturates when these two processes balance each other . as it has been shown @xcite , when @xmath36 the kinetic equation in the quasi - stationary regime ( @xmath37 ) reduces to @xmath38}{\\partial p_{_\\parallel } } + \\frac{1}{p_{_\\parallel}\\psi}\\frac{\\partial\\left[\\psi f_{\\perp}f\\right]}{\\partial\\psi } = \\frac{1}{\\psi}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\psi\\partial p_{_\\parallel}}\\left(d_{\\perp_{\\parallel}}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\psi}\\right)+\\ ] ]    @xmath39,\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the distribution function of particles , @xmath41 is the longitudinal momentum , @xmath42 are the diffusion coefficients and @xmath43 is the density of the beam component .",
    "this equation can be solved easily if one expresses the distribution function as @xmath44 .",
    "then , after substituting this expression into eq . ( [ kinet ] ) one gets following @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47{a}}.\\ ] ] is the mean value of the pitch angle .",
    "relativistic electrons moving in the magnetic field emit photons with energies expressed by @xmath48@xcite , which after applying eq .",
    "( [ pitch ] ) reduces to : @xmath49 according to the results of the magic cherenkov telescope @xcite , the vhe ( @xmath0 ) pulsed radiation from the crab pulsar peaks with the same phase as the optical signal .",
    "this circumstance is in a good agreement with our model , since , as we have shown , the pitch angles increase due to the cyclotron instability , which in its turn occurs in the optical frequency ranges .",
    "let us apply eqs .",
    "( [ pitch],[eps1 ] ) to the crab pulsar . then by taking into account the following parameters , @xmath50 , @xmath26 and @xmath51",
    ", one can show that the pitch angle is of the order of @xmath52 , which guarantees the observed high energy emission if @xmath53 .",
    "for the mentioned set of parameters one has @xmath54 , which reduces the distribution function to @xmath55 . on the other hand",
    ", the spectrum of the synchrotron radiation behaves as @xmath56 @xcite , where @xmath57 describes the particle distribution function , @xmath58 .",
    "this indicates that , for the case considered in the present paper ( @xmath59 ) the spectral index of the vhe synchrotron emission equals @xmath1 .    therefore , as we see , the synchrotron emission can explain the observed vhe radiation , and as we have already seen , for this purpose the particles must have very high lorentz factors . on the other hand",
    ", these particles will inevitably encounter soft photons , which in turn can also create the high energy radiation via the ics .",
    "but in this case the emission will not be localized contrary to the observational evidence , indicating that for some reason the ics is not involved in the process of the detected emission .",
    "the next subsection is dedicated to this particular problem .",
    "it is well known that when a photon with energy @xmath60 encounters a relativistic electron , under certain conditions photons might gain energy . the corresponding frequency after scattering",
    "is given by @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the frequency before scattering , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "by @xmath67 and @xmath68 we denote the three momentum of the photon before and after scattering respectively .",
    "the momentum of relativistic electrons before scattering is denoted by @xmath69 .",
    "since , according to the observational evidence , we observe the well localized pulses of high energy emission , therefore the angle , @xmath70 must be very small .",
    "on the other hand , analyzing the excitation of oblique waves in a relativistic electron - positron plasma one can argue that the pitch angle has to be extremely low @xcite . then , eq .",
    "( [ ics1 ] ) reduces to @xmath71 we will study two principally different cases : ( a ) @xmath72 and ( b ) @xmath73 . in the first case , we have @xmath74 where we have taken into account the following approximate relation , @xmath75 for @xmath76 . from this expression",
    "we see that for all physical quantities the frequency after the scattering is less than that of before the scattering and therefore , there is no possibility of increasing @xmath62 to the vhe band .    by considering the second limit , eq .",
    "( [ ics2 ] ) reduces to @xmath77 which , as in the previous case , leads to the similar result , @xmath78 .",
    "this investigation shows that the ics can not provide the vhe radiation from the crab pulsar detected by magic @xcite .      since particles are moving along the curved magnetic field lines continuously",
    ", they will emit the curvature radiation . on the other hand , in eq .",
    "( [ kinet ] ) we have neglected a term corresponding to the curvature emission .",
    "this in its turn , means that the following ratio @xmath79 where @xcite @xmath80 and @xmath22 is the curvature radius of magnetic field lines , must be less than one . by applying eqs .",
    "( [ eps1],[rat],[cur ] ) , one can show that for typical magnetospheric parameters of the crab pulsar close to the light cylinder , the aforementioned ratio is negligible only if the curvature radius exceeds the light cylinder radius , @xmath81 , approximately by three orders of magnitude",
    ".    generally speaking , since no contribution in emission comes from the closed magnetic field lines , we consider the open ones . on the other hand , in the dipolar field",
    "the region of almost straight field lines is just a tiny fraction of the emission area , leading to a negligible value of the high energy luminosity .",
    "if the beam component particles move along curved field lines , they experience the so - called curvature drift with the velocity : @xmath82 where @xmath83 ; and @xmath84 is the background magnetic field induction",
    ". this velocity will eventually create the drift current , @xmath85 which in turn , via the maxwell equation @xmath86 can create the toroidal magnetic field ( by @xmath87 we denote a direction of the drift current .",
    "see fig . [ fig ] ) .",
    "this current is evidently less than the goldreich - julian ( gj ) current @xmath88 , since @xmath89 .",
    "but on the other hand , the gj current creates the corresponding magnetic field , @xmath90 , where @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) is the length scale of the spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field .",
    "if we assume a dipolar configuration , then , by taking the value of the gj density , @xmath93 , into account , one can show that the toroidal magnetic field equals @xmath94 . inside the light cylinder ( @xmath95 )",
    ", this value is less than the background magnetic field-@xmath96 and therefore such a toroidal magnetic field will be unable to rectify the twisted magnetic field lines .",
    "this implies that the curvature drift current , which is less than that of the gj , can not contribute to the process of rectifying the field lines .",
    "however , in spite of that the drift current is not the source of the toroidal component , @xmath97 , it is a trigger mechanism for generatign the perturbed current , @xmath98 responsible for the creation of @xmath97 ( see eq .",
    "( [ indp ] ) ) , where by upper script @xmath99 we denote the perturbed quantities .",
    "the source of the instability of current and the resulting magnetic field is the pulsar s rotational energy and the process is achieved via the parametrically excited curvature drift waves .",
    "the corresponding increment of the curvature drift instability can be presented by ( see appendix , for more details see @xcite ) : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the beam component plasma frequency and @xmath102 - the lorentz factor in an unperturbed state .",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath104 are the wave vector s components and @xmath105 is the angular velocity of rotation .    by considering the typical magnetospheric parameters for the crab pulsar close to the light cylinder , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and examining the perturbation lengthscale @xmath108 @xcite , one can see that the increment is of the order of @xmath109 . comparing this value with the crab pulsar s slowdown rate , @xmath110 , we see that the instability growth rate exceeds by many orders of magnitude the slowdown rate , indicating that the mentioned instability is extremely efficient .",
    "it is worth noting that we have three types of the open field lines : ( a ) curved field lines which pass ahead of the rotation ; ( b ) a tiny fraction of almost straight field lines and ( c ) curved field lines , lagging behind the rotation .",
    "if the initial perturbation of the toroidal magnetic field satisfies the condition @xmath111 , then such a perturbation will rectify all field lines which initially pass ahead of the rotation ( suppose the clockwise rotation of the system ) and will twist even more the magnetic field lines , which initially lag behind the rotation . in the case ,",
    "@xmath112 , the situation is opposite : the field lines initially lagging behind the rotation will be rectified . at this stage",
    "the curvature becomes infinity and as we see from eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , the drift velocity tends to zero , saturating ( killing ) the instability .",
    "the investigation shows that , the curvature drift instability provides necessary conditions for an efficient mechanism of rectifying the field lines , leading to the negligible role of the curvature radiation , confirming our assumptions leading to eq .",
    "( [ kinet ] ) .",
    "1 .   we have considered several emission mechanisms for explaining the recently detected vhe emission from the crab pulsar .",
    "2 .   studying the synchrotron mechanism , we have shown that due to the cyclotron instability efficiently developing on light cylinder scales , non - vanishing pitch angles are created , that leads to the efficient high energy synchrotron emission with the spectral index @xmath1 .",
    "the observational fact of the coincidence of signals in optical and high energy ( @xmath0 ) intervals is in a good agreement with our model , in the framework of which , the cyclotron instability is excited in the optical spectra , which , via the synchrotron process leads to the high energy emission .",
    "4 .   analyzing the inverse compton scattering , we have found that for crab pulsar s magnetospheric parameters even very energetic electrons are unable to produce the observed photon energies .",
    "5 .   considering the curvature radiation ,",
    "we show that due to the curvature drift instability , the magnetic field lines are rectified very efficiently .",
    "this in turn , leads to a negligible role of the curvature emission process in the observed vhe emission along the aforementioned rectified field lines .",
    "as we see , the detected coincidence of vhe and optical signals is an indirect confirmation of the fact that ( a ) both spectra is produced by one source and ( b ) the only mechanism providing the detected high energy radiation is the synchrotron mechanism .",
    "this means that we observe the crab pulsar towards these straight field lines , that is the reason why we do not see the curvature radiation coming from the twisted magnetic field lines .",
    "the research was supported by the georgian national science foundation grant gnsf / st06/4 - 096 .",
    "in this section we study the process of rectifying the magnetic field lines due to the parametrically excited curvature drift instability .",
    "this instability is called parametric , because an external force - centrifugal force , plays a role of a parameter , changes in time and creates the instability . generally speaking",
    ", the presence of an external varying parameter generates the plasma instability .",
    "the mechanism of energy pumping process from the external alternating electric field into the electron - ion plasma is quite well investigated in @xcite . instead of considering the altering electric field",
    ", one can examine the centrifugal force as a varying parameter @xcite .",
    "we start our consideration by supposing that the magnetic field lines are almost straight with very small nonzero curvature ( see fig . [ fig ] ) . in this context",
    "we examine the field lines that are open , and thus have the curvature radius exceeding the light cylinder one , maximum by one order .",
    "therefore , dynamics of particles , governing the overall picture of the curvature drift instability , can be studied , assuming that field lines are almost straight . in the framework of the paper",
    "we suppose that the plasma flow consists of two components : the plasma component composed of electrons and positrons ( @xmath113 ) ; and , the so - called , beam component ( @xmath114 ) composed of relativistic electrons .",
    "it is well known that the dynamics of plasma particles moving along the straight co - rotating magnetic field lines is described by the euler equation : @xcite : @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 is the coordinate along the straight field lines ; @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 are the momentum ( normalized to the particle s mass ) , the velocity and the charge of electrons / positrons , respectively ; @xmath121 denotes the sort of particles and @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the electric and the magnetic field induction respectively . the continuity equation : @xmath124 and the induction equation : @xmath125 ( where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the density and the current , respectively )",
