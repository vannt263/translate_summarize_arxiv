    "the magnetic field is one of the principal properties in the phenomena of the astrophysical objects .",
    "in fact , it is believed that the magnetic fields can play an important role during supernova explosions , gamma - ray bursts , jets from active galactic nuclei , and so on .",
    "the existence of strongly magnetized neutron stars , the so - called magnetars , is also suggested via the measurements of spin period and its down rate of the central objects in soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars . according to the magnetic dipole model ,",
    "the strength of surface magnetic fields of the magnetars is considered to be as large as @xmath0 g @xcite . from the sgrs , sporadic radiations of @xmath1- and x - rays",
    "are observed , while fierce flare activities called the giant flares are also detected on rare occasions . in particular , the quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) discovered in the afterglow of",
    "the giant flares give us the evidences of the oscillations of the magnetized neutron stars @xcite .",
    "to theoretically explain the qpo frequencies , there are many attempts in term of the crustal oscillations @xcite and/or magnetic oscillations @xcite . in any case , in addition to the eos for neutron star matter , the structure of magnetic fields inside the neutron star must be crucial to understand such phenomena",
    ".    on the other hand , the gravitational theory must be also imperative to discuss the relativistic objects .",
    "the general relativity is mathematically beautiful theory of gravity , and its validity has been probed by a lot of experiments and astronomical observations .",
    "however , most of the verifications of general relativity have been done in a weak field regime , such as the solar system @xcite , while the tests in a strong field regime are very poor .",
    "perhaps , the gravitational theory describing the astronomical phenomena in a strong field regime might be different from general relativity .",
    "this is a reason why modified theories of gravity are proposed . since the observable properties could depend on the gravitational theory",
    ", one would see the imprint of the gravitational theory as an inverse problem @xcite .",
    "in fact , the science technology is developing increasingly , which will enable us to observe the relativistic objects and phenomena around such objects with high precision .",
    "probably , the gravitational waves radiated from such a system are also one of them . through these observations , it is possible to probe the gravitational theory @xcite .    as a modified theory of gravity , eibi is recently drawing attention in the context of the avoidance of the big bang singularity @xcite .",
    "this theory is originally proposed by baados and ferreira @xcite , based on the gravitational action proposed by eddington @xcite and on the nonlinear electrodynamics by born and infeld @xcite .",
    "eibi is developed according to a paratini approach , where the connection is considered as an independent field , because the field equations contain ghosts in the metric approach @xcite .",
    "the deviation of eibi from general relativity can be seen only when the matter exists , i.e. , eibi in vacuum is completely equivalent to general relativity , and the deviation becomes significant in high density region .",
    "thus , the compact objects are good candidates to see such a deviation . up to now",
    ", the compact objects in eibi are discussed on several occasions and shown the deviation in stellar properties from the expectations in general relativity @xcite .",
    "maybe , via the direct observations of such stellar properties , one would distinguish eibi from general relativity .",
    "we remark that in eibi the curvature singularity can appear at the stellar surface for polytropic eoss @xcite , which must be a problem to solve even thought this theory is attractive .",
    "however , in spite of the importance of magnetic effects in astronomical phenomena , the magnetic fields on the neutron stars in eibi have not been considered .",
    "there are solely the considerations on the electrically charged black holes in eibi @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper , we consider the magnetized relativistic stellar models in eibi .",
    "this discussion could become a fist step to examine the phenomena associated with the neutron stars in eibi .",
    "actually , there are many uncertainties in the magnetic properties , such as its geometry and the currents supporting it , even for a given fixed eos .",
    "so , it must be quite difficult to see the imprints of the gravitational theory in the magnetic properties , if neutron stars would have different magnetic geometry and/or crust properties irrespectively of the theory of gravity . in this paper , to see how the magnetic fields depend on the gravitational theory , we especially focus on the axisymmetric dipole configuration of magnetic fields , because such configuration could be dominant in the old neutron stars .",
    "the additional factors to determine the magnetic properties should be taken into account , but we neglect such effects here to simplify the problem . in this paper , we adopt geometric units , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath5 .",
    "before considering the stellar models in eibi , we briery mention eibi .",
    "this gravitational theory is obtained from the action @xmath6 given by @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the determinants of the physical metric @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the ricci tensor constructed from the connection @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denotes the matter action depending on the metric @xmath10 and matter field @xmath15 .",
    "that is , the matter field is assumed to minimally couple to the metric tensor , @xmath10 , i.e. , the matter action depends on @xmath10 independently of the connection @xmath16 .",
    "this theory also has a dimensionless constant @xmath17 and the eddington parameter @xmath18 , which are related to the cosmological constant as @xmath19 .",
    "since we especially focus on the asymptotic flat solutions ( @xmath20 ) in this paper , hereafter we take @xmath21 . on the other hand , @xmath18 is constrained from the observations in solar system , big bang nucleosynthesis , and the existence of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the existence of neutron stars can give us the strong constraint on @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath22 m@xmath23 kg@xmath24 s@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "recently , the possibility to constrain @xmath18 with the terrestrial measurements of the neutron skin thickness of @xmath26pb and the astronomical observations of the radius of @xmath27 neutron star , is also suggested @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the normalized coupling constant such as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the saturation density , i.e. , @xmath30 g/@xmath31 .",
    "we remark that @xmath28 becomes a dimensionless parameter .",
    "eibi is characterized by two independent fields , i.e. , the physical metric @xmath10 and the connection @xmath13 .",
    "so , varying the action with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath10 , one can obtain the field equations for @xmath33 ; @xmath34 where @xmath35 is determinant of @xmath36 and @xmath36 is an auxiliary metric associated with the connection as @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 denotes the energy - momentum tensor , which is given by @xmath39 .",
    "equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) shows that the auxiliary metric @xmath36 becomes equivalent to the physical metric @xmath10 , if @xmath40 .",
    "that is , eibi without matter reduces to general relativity in vacuum @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above field equations , the energy - momentum tensor should satisfy the conservation law , i.e. , @xmath41 , where the covariant derivative @xmath42 is defined by @xmath10 .",
    "as far as we know , unfortunately , there is no explicit proof that the conservation law of @xmath41 is directly derived from the field equations ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "however , since the matter field is minimally coupled to the metric @xmath10 , the conservation law might be obtained as in ref .",
    "@xcite , if the argument in @xcite is applicable even for a bi - metric theory like eibi .",
    "now , we consider the neutron star models in eibi",
    ". in general , magnetized neutron stars could deform due to non - spherically symmetric magnetic pressure .",
    "however , the magnetic energy in the neutron star is much smaller than the gravitational binding energy even for a magnetar , which is strongly magnetized neutron star .",
    "that is , the deformation due to the magnetic pressure is quite small and the shape of star is almost spherically symmetric .",
    "thus , in this paper , we neglect the stellar deformation induced by the existence of magnetic field . under such assumption , the equilibrium stellar model can be determined as a solution of tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations in eibi @xcite .",
    "the metric describing the stellar models is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "in this paper , we consider the stellar models composed of perfect fluid , i.e. , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the energy density , pressure , and four velocity of matter given by @xmath49 .",
    "then , one can show that @xmath50 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are given by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively @xcite .",
    "in addition to tov equations , one needs to prepare the eos for neutron star matter to construct the stellar models .",
    "we particularly adopt fps @xcite and sly4 eoss @xcite , which are based on the skyrme - type effective interaction ( also see @xcite for the adopted eoss ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mr ] shows the neutron star models constructed with fps eos , where the left panel corresponds to the stellar mass as a function of the central density normalized by @xmath29 , while the right panel corresponds to the stellar mass as a function of the stellar radius . in this figure , the solid line denotes the results in general relativity and the other lines denote the results in eibi with various values of @xmath28 . from this figure",
    ", one can easily observe that the mass and radius of neutron stars depend strongly on the coupling constant in eibi , even if eos of neutron star matter is fixed .",
    "in fact , the stellar radii of @xmath55 neutron stars in eibi become @xmath56% smaller for @xmath57 , @xmath58% larger for @xmath59 , and @xmath60% larger for @xmath61 , compared with that in general relativity .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we consider the magnetic fields in the neutron stars in eibi , where we especially focus on the dipole magnetic fields because such fields must be dominant in old neutron stars . to construct magnetic fields inside the neutron star , we derive the relativistic grad - shafranov equation in eibi . since the spacetime in vacuum in eibi is equivalent to that in general relativity , i.e. , the schwarzschild spacetime , the magnetic field in eibi outside the star is also equivalent to that in general relativity .",
    "in such a way that the interior magnetic fields should be connected to the exterior solution , the structure of magnetic fields is determined .",
    "then , we find that the magnetic geometry inside the neutron stars in eibi is qualitatively similar to that in general relativity .",
    "the deviation of magnetic fields in eibi from that in general relativity is not so much , which is almost comparable to the uncertainty due to the eos for neutron star matter .",
    "therefore , it might be difficult to distinguish eibi from general relativity only by using the observations of the magnetic properties in neutron stars .",
    "however , the magnetic fields in the crust region for the neutron star with canonical mass depend weakly on the coupling constant in eibi , while the crust properties such as the crust thickness depends strongly on the eos for neutron star matter @xcite . that is , independently of the gravitational theory",
    ", one might be able to see the information about the eos in crust region through the observations associated with the phenomena in crust region , such as the stellar oscillations .",
    "anyway , there are many uncertainties in the magnetic properties even in general relativity , such as the magnetic geometry and the current distribution supporting the fields , although we consider only dipole magnetic fields in this paper .",
    "comparing to such uncertainties , the imprint of eibi gravity on the magnetic fields is weak , which suggests that the magnetic field could be a poor probe of gravitational theories .",
