    "revealing the origin of the electroweak symmtry breaking ( ewsb ) is the most pressing question in particle physics in the era of cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "another important problem in particle astrophysics and cosmology is to identify the nature of cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "also there is a more speculative issue about the existence of a new hidden sector , which is generic in supersymmetric ( susy ) model buildings or superstring theories .    in this talk",
    ", i would like to consider three seemingly unrelated questions :    * can all the masses arise ( mostly ) from quantum mechanics , as in massless qcd ? * what is the nature of cdm ?",
    "is it possible to have all the global symmetry as accidental symmetries , as in the standard model ( sm ) ? * what would be the phenomenological consequences , if there is a hidden sector ?",
    "i will present models with a hidden sector where these seemingly unrelated questions are in fact closely connected with each other .",
    "more details and complete list of references can be found in ref.s   .",
    "let me remind you that there is a good old example , namely quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) , where we can learn many lessons related with the issues listed above .",
    "qcd has many nice features : renormalizability , asymptotic freedom , confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , dynamical generation of hadron masses , natural hierarchy between the planck scale and the qcd scale @xmath0 . in addition pions",
    "are stable if electroweak interactions are switched off",
    ". it would be nice if we could have a model for ewsb in the same manner as the dimensional transmutation in qcd , and cdm is stable as pions are stable under strong interaction .",
    "the basic features of our models are the following .",
    "we assume a vectorlike confining gauge theory such as qcd or technicolor in the hidden sector , which we dub as hidden sector technicolor ( htc ) .",
    "then dimensional transmutation will occur in the hidden sector , and this scale is transmitted to the sm by a messenger , and triggers ewsb . and",
    "the lightest mesons in the hidden sector becomes a cdm .",
    "let us assume that there is a new strong interaction that is described by @xmath1 guage theory with vectorlike quarks @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath4 flavors , such as qcd with the confinement scale @xmath5 .",
    "this scale is presumed to be higher than the electroweak scale by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "@xmath6 then this new strong interaction will trigger chiral symmetry breaking due to nonzero @xmath7 . for illustration",
    ", we assume that there is an approximate @xmath8 global symmetry in the hidden sector that breaks down to @xmath9 spontaneously . in the low energy limit of htc",
    ", massless nambu - goldstone bosons will appear , which are dubbed as hidden sector pion @xmath10 .",
    "also there would be a scalar resonance like the ordinary @xmath11 , and we call it @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath12 will form @xmath8 bidoublet ( denoted as @xmath14 ) and the low energy effective theory will be the same as the gelmann - levy s linear @xmath11 model , except that the mesons are in the hidden sector , so that sm singlets .",
    "they are all neutral .",
    "the potential for the sm higgs and the hidden sector @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 this looks like the potential in the 2-higgs doublet model , but there are important differences .",
    "first , @xmath14 is a sm singlet , not a sm doublet . @xmath16 and @xmath17 get masses entirely from @xmath18 vev",
    ". and the @xmath19 term is new in our model , and necessary to generate the mass for the hidden sector pion . note that the @xmath20 term connects the sm and the hidden sector , and originates from nonrenormalizable interactions between two sectors , or by some messengers .",
    "it is straightforward to analyze phenomenology from this scalar potential .",
    "the generic predictions of our models are the following :    * the origin of the ewsb , namely the negative higgs mass@xmath21 parameter could be the chiral symmetry breaking in the htc . *",
    "the electroweak precision test does not put strong constraints unlike in the ordinary technicolor models , since @xmath14 does not contribute to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 masses at tree level . and no higgs - mediated fcnc problem since @xmath14 does not couple to the sm fermions .",
    "* there are more than one neutral higgs - like scalar bosons , and they can decay into the @xmath10 with a large invisible branching ratio .",
    "this makes relatively difficult to produce and discover these higgs - lilke neutral scalars at colliders .",
    "1 ( a ) and ( b ) . *",
    "the hidden sector pion ( @xmath10 ) is stable due to the flavor conservation in the htc , and could be a good cdm candidate .",
    "direct detection rate of the @xmath10 is in a promising sensitivity of the current / future dm detection experiments such as cdms , xenon10 or xmass ( fig .  2 ( a ) ) .",
    "branching ratios of ( a ) @xmath22 and ( b ) @xmath23 as functions of @xmath24 for @xmath25 , @xmath26 gev and @xmath27 gev.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   branching ratios of ( a ) @xmath22 and ( b ) @xmath23 as functions of @xmath24 for @xmath25 , @xmath26 gev and @xmath27 gev.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]     @xmath28 as functions of @xmath24 for ( a ) @xmath25 in model i , and ( b ) model ii .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    @xmath28 as functions of @xmath24 for ( a ) @xmath25 in model i , and ( b ) model ii . ,",
    "the model i has a few drawbacks , since the hidden sector quark masses @xmath29 s are given by hand , and the model i is not renormalizable .",
    "these can be cured by introducing a real singlet scalar @xmath30 and making the following replacement , @xmath31 in eq .",
    ". then @xmath32 has classical scale symmetry . with a real singlet @xmath30",
    ", the sm lagrangian is implemented into @xmath33 assuming classical scale symmetry .",
    "since there are no mass parameters in this lagrangain , this is a suitable starting point to investigate if it is possible to have all the masses from quantum mechanical effects .",
    "note that the real singlet scalar @xmath30 plays the role of messenger connecting the sm higgs sector and the hidden sector quarks .",
    "dimensional transmutation in the hidden sector will generate the hidden qcd scale and chiral symmetry breaking with developing nonzero @xmath34 .",
    "then the @xmath35 term generate the linear potential for the real singlet @xmath30 , leading to nonzero @xmath36 .",
    "this in turn generates the hidden sector current quark masses through @xmath37 terms as well as the ewsb through @xmath38 term .",
    "the @xmath10 will get nonzero masses , and becomes a good cdm candidate . due to",
    "the presence of the messenger @xmath30 , the cdm pair annihilation into the sm particles occurs more efficiently in model ii than in model i , and it is easy to accommodate the wmap data on @xmath39 .",
    "direct detection rates are in the interesting ranges ( see fig .  2 ( b ) ) .",
    "all the qualitative features of this model is similar to the model i. see ref .   for more details .",
    "in this talk , i presented models where the origin of ewsb and cdm lie in the hidden sector technicolor interaction . in the model",
    "ii , all the masses including the cdm mass arise quantum mechanically from dimensional transmutation in the hidden sector .",
    "one can enjoy many variations of these models by considering different gauge groups and matter fields in the hidden sector .",
    "if we include the radiative corrections to the scalar potential , the details could change , but the qualitative features described in this talk would remain untouched .",
