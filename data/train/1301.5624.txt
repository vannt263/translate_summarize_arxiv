    "have been developed .",
    "for example , one can examine a distance measure between the actual evolution and the best markovian model of a system bath arrangement .",
    "however , this approach is rarely used because of the difficulty of finding an optimum markovian approximation@xcite .",
    "there are other methods which involve examining the mathematical structure of the map defining the time evolution of the system @xcite .",
    "other techniques which have been proposed are based on determining the minimum amount of noise required to make the dynamics markovian@xcite or studying the evolution of entanglement for a system prepared initially in a maximally entangled state@xcite .",
    "here we choose a method of studying the degree of non - markovianity similar to the one proposed in @xcite and further examined in @xcite .",
    "its central idea is to examine the trace distance between two different initial system states under time evolution ( for examples of other methods and techniques , both analytic and numerical , see @xcite ) .",
    "the trace distance is defined as    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two different initial states which are product states of the system and the bath with the same bath states but orthogonal system states .",

    "a system is necessarily behaving in a non - markovian fashion if the trace distance increases in time because of its interpretation as a measure of distinguishability .",
    "in general , the maximum of @xmath8 over all possible initial states has to be calculated ( see ref .",
    "however , in the case where the system has only a few degrees of freedom , a single pair of orthogonal states can still provide valuable insights into the overall non - markovian behavior of the system .",
    "furthermore , examining non - markovian behavior of a system by studying only two orthogonal initial states has the advantage that in numerical studies it is often impractical to maximize over all possible initial state pairs .",

    "non - markovian effects have also been observed in solid state systems , for example with electron transport though a quantum dot @xcite .",
    "theoretically , recent research in the field of non - markovian dynamics has been devoted to e.g. the study of memory effects@xcite , including examining the effect of bath memory on the equilibrium state of a system after evolving for a long time@xcite , the influence of a chaotic environment on non - markovian dynamics @xcite or the connection between non - markovianty and entanglement @xcite .",

    "we have found that these peaks can be explained by partial reconstructions of states which are similar to the initial states having a trace distance of one . in the following",
    "we elucidate this mechanism of state reconstruction .    for the torus the outgoing wavefunction from the initial state which is localized on the system sites propagates freely in both directions when the connections between the system and the bath are turned on .",

    "similarly , the wavefunctions of the other states which initially have zero amplitude in the system reconstruct states with an approximately similar shape .",

    "formally , the torus has a @xmath39 symmetry group whereas the strip only has the cyclic symmetry group @xmath40@xcite .",
    "the larger symmetry group of the torus allows the wavefunction to preserve more of its shape while propagating .",
    "therefore the torus allows for reconstructions which do not occur for the strip . note that these reconstructions occur at a much shorter timescale than the recurrences which must occur because any finite closed quantum system must eventually return to a state arbitrarily close to its initial state@xcite . to avoid confusion",

    "the addition of randomness breaks this symmetry and therefore leads to level splitting . for small randomness",
