    "cholesteric liquid crystals _ ( clc ) molecules align on average along a local unit director @xmath7 that rotates in a helical fashion about a uniform twist axis  @xcite .",
    "this tendency of clcs to form helical twisting patterns is caused by the presence of anisotropic molecules with no mirror plane    so - called chiral molecules ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .    in planar clc cells bounded by two parallel substrates orientational structures ( director configurations )",
    "are strongly affected by the anchoring conditions at the boundary surfaces .",
    "these conditions break the translational symmetry along the twisting axis and , in general , the helical form of the director field will be distorted .    nevertheless ,",
    "when the anchoring conditions are planar and out - of - plane deviations of the director are suppressed , it might be expected that the configurations still have the form of the ideal helical structure : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the _ helix wave number _ and @xmath10 is the phase at @xmath11 .",
    "but , by contrast with the case of unbounded clcs , the helix twist wave number @xmath12 will now differ from @xmath13 .",
    "a mismatch between the twist imposed by the boundary conditions and the equilibrium pitch @xmath1 may produce two metastable twisting states that are degenerate in energy and can be switched either way by applying an electric field  @xcite .",
    "this bistability underlines the mode of operation of bistable liquid crystal devices  @xcite .",
    "more generally the metastable twisting states in clc cells appear as a result of interplay between the bulk and the surface contributions to the free energy .",
    "the free twisting number @xmath14 and the anchoring energy are among the key factors that govern their properties .",
    "specifically , varying @xmath14 will change the twist wave number of the twisting state , @xmath12 , and may result in sharp transitions    the so - called _ pitch transitions _    between different branches of metastable states .",
    "the dependence of the twist wave number @xmath12 on the free twisting number @xmath14 is then discontinuous .",
    "in particular , these discontinuities manifest themselves in a jump - like temperature dependence of selective light transmission spectra  @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms behind the temperature variations of the pitch in clc cells and hysteresis phenomena were discussed in refs .",
    "a comprehensive stability analysis of the helical structures in clc cells with symmetric and asymmetric boundary conditions was performed in ref .",
    "the effects of bistable surface anchoring and mechanical strain on the pitch transitions have been studied theoretically in the recent papers  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .    in practice ,",
    "most cholesteric liquid crystals are prepared on the basis of nematic lc mixtures doped with chiral additives that induce a helical structure  @xcite .",
    "for photosensitive chiral dopants , their helical twisting power and thus the equilibrium helix pitch may , in principle , be controlled by light giving rise to the technologically promising effect of phototunable selective reflection ( i.e. a change in the spectral position of the bandgap with light exposure )  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism underlying the phototunable reflection typically involves photoinduced changes in dopant conformation that affect the lc s helical twisting power ( see the recent review  @xcite ) .    on the other hand , the light - driven variations of the free twist wave number may trigger the pitch transitions discussed above and can be used as a tool to explore the details of such transitions , depending on a variety of factors . in particular ,",
    "the surface anchoring energy is known to have a profound effect on the pitch transitions .",
    "these surface mediated effects will be of our primary concern .",
    "more specifically , we shall study the pitch transitions in photosensitive clc cells with strong and semistrong anchoring conditions by using an experimental method that involves modeling of the photoreaction kinetics combined with polarimetry measurements .",
    "the results of modeling of the photoreaction kinetics are used to obtain the equilibrium pitch @xmath1 as a function of the uv irradiation time .",
    "a similar irradiation time dependence of the pitch in the clc cells , @xmath0 , is extracted from experimental data on the ellipticity of transmitted light measured at different irradiation doses .",
    "the resulting dependence of the twist wave number @xmath12 on the free twisting number @xmath14 describes the pitch transitions and can be interpreted using known theoretical models .",

    "wt.% , the photoinduced reorientation processes in such cells are not complicated by inhomogeneity effects related to the formation of highly twisted states .      when a light beam propagates through an optically anisotropic medium , the anisotropy is known to greatly affect its state of polarization  @xcite .",
    "this state is generally described by the stokes parameters and can be conveniently represented by a polarization ellipse whose orientation and eccentricity are specified by the azimuthal angle of polarization ( _ polarization azimuth _ ) @xmath29 and the _ ellipticity _ @xmath30 , respectively  @xcite .    for light propagating through a clc cell where the optical anisotropy is determined by the helical orientational structure  ,",
    "its ellipticity is sensitive to the pitch of the clc spiral  @xcite .",
    "thus the cholesteric pitch @xmath0 in photosensitive clc cells may , in principle , be estimated by measuring the ellipticity of light passed through the cells .    in our experiments ,",
    "the measurements were performed for light which is normally incident onto the aligned substrate and is linearly polarized along the direction of rubbing .",
    "figure  [ fig : norm_inc_geom ] illustrates the geometry of normal incidence .",
    "we have used planar clc cells where the photosensitive clc was sandwiched between quartz substrates . in the symmetric case of strong anchoring conditions ,",

    "note that the above procedure relies on the computed curve representing the @xmath12-dependence of the ellipticity of light transmitted through the clc cell .",

    "it comes as no surprise that , for the untreated substrate , the estimated anchoring energy is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than typical values for the azimuthal anchoring energy strength  @xcite .",
    "in the confined geometry of planar cells , the helical structures formed in the cells and their stability are greatly affected by the boundary conditions imposed at the confining surfaces .",
    "the helix pitch characterizing these structures generally differs from its equilibrium value .",

    "the equilibrium pitch can be efficiently controlled by light through photochemically induced transformations of chiral dopants .    in order to determine the concentrations of photoisomers that govern the equilibrium pitch ( and the free twisting wave number @xmath13 )",

    "there are two cases that have been studied experimentally : ( a )  a symmetric cell with strong anchoring conditions at both substrates ; and ( b )  an asymmetric cell with mixed boundary conditions where weak anchoring conditions are applied at one of the substrates ( semistrong anchoring ) .    from the steplike dependence of the twist parameter @xmath62 on the free twist parameter @xmath63 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strong ] , it can be concluded that the light - induced pitch transitions in the symmetric cell are governed by the boundary conditions and involve metastable twisting states . by contrast , the similar dependence for the asymmetric cell with semistrong anchoring ( see fig .",

    "@xcite . according to this analysis",
    ", the helical structure responds to variations of the free wave number @xmath14 ( and thus the free twist parameter @xmath64 ) by changing its twist parameter @xmath47 .",
    "this change may render the initially equilibrium structure either metastable or unstable . under certain conditions ,",
    "this instability is governed by in - plane director fluctuations .",
    "the mechanism dominating transformations of the director field then can be described as director slippage through the energy barriers formed by the surface potentials .    for the case of semistrong anchoring , equations   and   define branches of stable helical structures .",
    "these formulas were used to fit the experimental data and the best fit value of the anchoring energy parameter is estimated at about @xmath65 .",
    "so , the anchoring energy strength at the untreated substrate is found to be at least two orders of magnitude smaller than typical values of the azimuthal anchoring strength .",
    "it turns out that this value is not small enough to suppress the jump - like behavior . from eq .",
