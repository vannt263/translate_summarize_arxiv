    "the local bubble ( lb ) or local hot bubble and its environment are sketched in figure  [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the local bubble , a @xmath7  pc@xmath8 region of x - ray emissive , presumably hot ( @xmath7  k ) plasma , is nestled within a rarefied cavity in the galactic disk called the local cavity , @xcite . within the local bubble , lie a number of cool ( @xmath9  k ) clouds , including the complex of parsec - scale clouds surrounding the sun @xcite .",
    "estimates of the number of clouds per line of sight range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , with @xmath10 coming from the ratio of the typical observed absorbing column density @xcite to the absorbing column density of the local cloud @xcite , and @xmath11 coming from the number of clouds along the @xmath12 cma line of sight @xcite",
    ". beyond the local bubble , in the direction of the galactic center , lies a superbubble named loop i , which was blown by the stars and supernovae in the sco cen association @xcite .",
    "the local bubble is larger and more energetic than a supernova remnant , yet smaller and less energetic than a superbubble .",
    "such bubbles are important as most of the hot gas in the galactic disk resides within them . like the distribution of small versus large stellar associations",
    ", the population of bubbles is likely to be larger than the population of superbubbles . nonetheless , because its softer x - ray photons from its relatively cooler plasma are more easily absorbed , a bubble like the local bubble would be much more difficult to detect from a great distance than would an energetic superbubble like loop i. thus , many other local bubble analogs may reside within the galaxy , unknown to us because they are obscured by the neutral and molecular material of the galactic disk . in this sense",
    ", we are fortunate to have a local specimen to examine .    at this time , our understanding of the local bubble is chiefly phenomenological . to some degree , the local bubble is defined as the source of soft x - rays ( @xmath13  kev ) produced between us and the nearest opaque material . its physical presence has been surmised from the anti - correlation between soft x - ray intensities and neutral hydrogen column densities ( associated with the larger local cavity ) , detections of x - rays originating in the foreground of opaque clouds , relative constancies between be ( 0.07 to 0.11 kev ) , b ( 0.13 to 0.19 kev ) and c ( 0.16 to 0.28 kev ) band surface brightnesses across the sky ( implying very little absorption as the effective absorption cross sections vary significantly between the bands ) , and consistency among two decades of x - ray observations .",
    "fundamental characteristics of the lb , such as its presumed temperature and size , can not be determined directly , but can only be estimated when additional constraints ( such as ionizational equilibrium , constancy of emissivity , and filling factor ) are assumed . given these assumptions , the estimated temperature has been derived from the ratio of fluxes in broad soft x - ray bands . in directions",
    "where the galactic disk blocks all of the @xmath14  kev emission from beyond the local bubble , the observed _ rosat _ r2 to r1 band ratio is @xmath15 , implying a temperature of @xmath16  k @xcite .",
    "this temperature is consistent with values found by shadowing observations ( described below ) at higher galactic latitudes @xcite and with wisconsin s _ ultrasoft x - ray telescope _",
    "( _ uxt _ ) and all - sky survey s b / be and c / b band ratios @xcite .",
    "similar temperatures were also derived from the _ diffuse x - ray spectrometer _ s soft x - ray spectra , although these high resolution spectra were difficult to fit with simple models @xcite .",
    "desirous of a better understanding of our environs as well as a model of the bubble population ( useful for calculating the hot gas filling factor ) , both observers and theorists have long sought explanations of the lb s origin and life history .",
    "many researchers have pointed out that the energy embodied in the local bubble s x - ray emitting plasma is so great as to require a supernova or a series of supernovae , possibly aided by stellar winds .",
    "the energy may have been deposited within an existing gap in the h i disk or may have pushed aside the disk material to create a cavity .",
    "alternatively , the explosion(s ) and winds may have originated in the nearby loop i ( sco - cen ) superbubble and blown into the solar region @xcite , or the local bubble and loop i may have been blown independently but are now interacting @xcite . in some of these scenarios , the x - ray emitting plasma may have expanded after being shock heated , vastly cooling the plasma , retarding the collisional recombination rates , and thus `` freezing '' the plasma into an `` overionized '' state @xcite . in contrast , if the expansion was restrained and the time - scale was long , the plasma may have already approached collisional ionizational equilibrium @xcite .",
    "these two cases should produce markedly different spectral signatures .",
    "presently , many theorists and observers are working to decipher the local bubble s life story by comparing its x - ray spectra to spectra predicted by hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "it is hoped that when the observed fluxes in multiple bands or emission lines are matched by the predictions of a particular type of model , then we will have found a key to deciphering the story of the local bubble . here , we extend this sort of comparison into the ultraviolet , using the o  resonance line ( 1032 , 1038  ) intensities .",
    "we also compare the intensities with o  absorption line column densities taken from the literature , in order to estimate the physical properties of the o  -bearing plasma .",
    "we use the `` shadowing '' strategy long employed in x - ray analyses to isolate the local bubble s emission from the more distant interstellar medium s emission ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the observations ( 228 ksec toward @xmath17 ) and data reduction techniques are discussed in section 3 . although we observed for a very long time , no o  resonance line emission was detected .",
    "tight upper limits were placed on the 1032 and 1038   lines ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the results of our searches for other cosmic lines within the bandpass are also reported ( see section 4 ) .",
    "our upper limit on the o  doublet intensity is well below the @xmath18  k , overionized model @xcite predictions .",
    "this discrepancy , as well as discrepancies in the c  intensities and the o  column density , practically disallow models of this sort .",
    "our two sigma upper limit on the o  doublet intensity is only marginally above the minimum intensity expected from the o  -rich zone around the most local cool cloud @xcite combined with the o  -rich regions in @xcite s suite of simulations of a multiple supernovae induced hot bubble . in the event that the line of sight intersects multiple cool clouds within the local bubble , as well as the local bubble s wall , then our doublet upper limit is well below the predicted intensity and",
    "places a strong constraint on models of hot gas / cool gas transition zones . in order to determine if the upper limits require the local bubble to be undergoing unusual physical processes or contain unusual plasmas , we constructed and compared with a generalized multi - component ( an o  -rich @xmath19  k plasma and a soft x - ray emitting @xmath20  k plasma ) model of the local bubble .",
    "this model s o  intensity and column density and soft x - ray surface brightness were all consistent with observations ( see section 5 ) . by combining our o  intensity upper limit with other researcher s o  column density estimates , we were able to calculate limits on the electron density , thermal pressure , pathlength , and cooling timescale ( also see section 5 ) . by subtracting the local bubble s o  doublet intensity upper limit from measurements for longer , high latitude lines of sights",
    ", we found the halo s intensity , from which its electron density , thermal pressure , pathlength , and cooling rate were estimated .",
    "the results of this project are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the intensity of resonance line photons from o  along extended lines of sight through the local bubble , the galactic halo , and intervening regions is reported elsewhere @xcite . here",
    ", we wish to measure * only * the o  intensity of the local bubble , and so must block the photons from external regions .",
    "to do so , we employ the `` shadowing '' strategy oft - used in x - ray analyses . in the ideal shadowing observation",
    ", an opaque object blocks the emission originating beyond it , so that the observed emission originates between the viewer and the object . for the shadowing object ,",
    "we have chosen a filament in the southern galactic hemisphere ( see figure  [ fig : diras ] ) .",
    "@xcite estimated the distance to the filament as 230@xmath2130 pc , which places the filament between the local bubble and the galactic halo .",
    "@xcite also estimated the mean color excess ( @xmath22 ) of the filament as 0.17@xmath210.05 magnitudes , implying an absorbing column density of @xmath23  @xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the column density implied by the @xcite _ iras _ 100 @xmath24 m measurement of @xmath25 mjy sr@xmath2 , which when scaled by the 100 @xmath24 m to @xmath26 converstion relation for the southern hemisphere listed in @xcite , yields a column density of @xmath27 @xmath1 . for this color excess and the extinction curve and parameterization presented in @xcite , @xmath28 of the o  photons originating beyond the filament",
    "should be blocked . as a demonstration of the filament s `` shadowing '' function ,",
    "we note it s ability to block soft x - rays .",
    "( the theoretical extinction of @xmath29 x - rays is larger than that of ultraviolet photons . )",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "@xmath14  kev band image",
    "( see figure  [ fig : diras ] ) reveals an obvious soft x - ray depression coincident with the filament .",
    "the surface brightness seen in the direction of the filament and attributed to the local bubble is @xmath30  counts s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath31 , while the `` off - filament '' surface brightness is @xmath32  counts s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath31 ( k. d. kuntz , private communication ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the filament has already been used successfully in _ rosat _ soft x - ray shadowing analyses @xcite .",
    "one potential difficulty in using this region of the sky is posed by @xcite s suggestion that the filament may be part of a supernova remnant .",
    "if this were the case , then the foreground o  intensity should be attributed to both the local bubble and the supposed supernova remnant . because the results or our study are upper limits , this point is unimportant .",
    "observations of the targeted region , the bulbous portion of the filament around @xmath17 , are discussed in the following section .",
    "the _ fuse _  focal plane assembly contains four spectrograph entrance apertures .",
    "the largest , the low resolution ( lwrs ) aperture measuring 30 ",
    "@xmath33 30  , is used for observations of diffuse sources .",
    "furthermore , the _ fuse _  instrument includes multiple approximately co - aligned channels .",
    "four of the channels ( lif 1a , sic 1a , lif 2b , and sic 2b ) cover the 1032 , 1038   region . of these , the lif 1a is most sensitive and least prone to scattered light problems in the 1032 , 1038   region .",
    "we use this channel for our o  analysis .",
    "in addition , we use the lif 1a , sic 1b , lif 2a , and sic 2a channels for the c  , c  , c  , n  , n  , n  , mg  , si  , s  , s  , s  , s  , fe  , and fe  analyses .    the raw data",
    "consists of multiple observations of three nearly coincident directions ( see table  [ table : data ] and figure  [ fig : pointings ] ) . the combined exposure time",
    "( after subtracting time when the spacecraft was exposed to the earth s south atlantic anomaly , time when the detectors recorded anomalous bursts , etc . ) for the lif 1a observations is 228 ksec .",
    "the other detectors have had differing useful exposure times .",
    "most notably , detector 2 malfunctioned during the i2050501 observation , reducing the total observation time with the lif 2a and sic 2a channels .",
    "the observations can be grouped according to pointing direction .",
    "henceforth , the combined i2050501 and i1050510 observations of @xmath34 will be denoted by `` i20505 '' , the i2050601 observation of @xmath35 will be denoted by `` i20506 '' , and the combined b1290101 and b1290102 observations of @xmath36 will be denoted by `` b12901 '' .",
    "each of these three datasets was processed using version 2.1 of the calfuse pipeline @xcite .",
    "we set the appropriate pipeline switches , so as to 1 . ) exclude counts that produced pulseheights outside the expected range for cosmic photons ( the chosen calfuse pipeline cutoffs were 4 and 12 in the standard arbitrary units for the older datasets ( i20505 and i20506 ) and 4 to 31 for the newer dataset ( b12901 ) ) in order to reduce the detector background noise , and 2 . )",
    "disallow automatic background subtraction , enabling us to more accurately calculate the signal to noise of the results .",
    "figure  [ fig : lif1a ] displays the 1020 to 1045   region of the lif 1a spectra for the three pointing directions . at this stage , the _ absolute _ wavelength scales are still inaccurate , though the _ relative _ wavelength scales of the pipeline spectra are accurate to several detector pixels ( about 0.035   in the lif  1a spectrum ) .",
    "the largest sources of systematic error in the following intensity calculations are the uncertainties in the solid angle of the aperture and effective area calibration . both the lwrs s solid angle ( 30 arcsec @xmath33 30 arcsec ) and the lif  1a effective area calibration",
    "are thought to be accurately known to @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the systematic uncertainty in intensity measurements will be @xmath38 .",
    "in order to determine the absolute wavelength scales for the lif 1a spectra from the three pointings , we used the airglow emission lines as reference wavelengths .",
    "we then co - added the spectra from the three pointings and shifted to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) reference frame .",
    "the 1020 to 1045   region of the resulting satellite - night and day @xmath39 night spectra are displayed in figure  [ fig : coadd ] .",
    "we found the continuum level in the satellite - night spectrum by fitting a smooth curve to the surrounding spectral region .",
    "we then searched the residual spectrum for emission features .",
    "none were found in close proximity to the o  resonance line rest wavelengths in the lsr reference frame .",
    "if cosmic features had existed , their widths would have equaled or exceeded the instrumental width function , their signals would have been calculated from the numbers of counts in excess of the continuum within the extraction width , and their random uncertainties would have been calculated from the square roots of the numbers of spectral counts ( not residual counts ) within the extraction width .",
    "we have followed this method , using the total instrumental width ( generously set to 0.43  ) as the extraction width , to determine the upper limits .",
    "the `` signal '' and 1 sigma statistical uncertainty intensities for the o  resonance lines at their rest wavelengths in the lsr reference frame are 180 @xmath21 330 and -180 @xmath21 310 photons @xmath1 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 , for the 1032 and 1038   lines , respectively .",
    "these measurements are subject to the above mentioned systematic uncertainties of @xmath40 .",
    "we validated our technique by applying the following alternate extraction technique to sample spectra .",
    "we fit the spectrum to a continuum and small emission feature , then varied the size of the feature to determine the 1 sigma uncertainties .",
    "the results were similar to those found by applying our techniques to the same spectra .",
    "when the satellite - day portions of the data sets were added , the spectrum became more ragged .",
    "from the variations between the i20505 , i20506 , and b12901 satellite - day spectra we surmise that the raggedness is primarily due to scattered light . for the combined day and night spectrum ,",

    "table  [ table : measurements ] tabulates these results and lists the tightest 1 and 2 sigma upper limits .",
    "the 1 and 2 sigma upper limits were calculated from the unrounded numbers .",
    "we also searched for c  , c  , c  , n  , n  , n  , mg  , si  , s  , s  , s  , s  , fe  , and fe  emission lines in the spectra taken with the lif 1a , sic 1b , lif 2a , and sic 2a detector segments .",
    "we relied on the satellite - night portion of the data when we searched for emission lines which also appear strongly in the solar spectrum ( i.e. c  , @xcite ) , appear weakly in the terrestrial airglow spectrum ( i.e. n  , @xcite ) , or are significantly stronger in the satellite - day portion of the data than in the satellite - night portion of the data ( i.e. c  ) .",
    "the only signals detected were marginally significant intensities of c  and n  ( see table  [ table : otherlines ] ) .",

    "the theoretical ratio of the intensity of 1032 to 1038   photons is 2.0 to 1.0 . using the 2.0 to 1.0 ratio and the 1032   line upper limit yields a 2 sigma doublet upper limit of 800 photons @xmath1",

    "_ breakout model : @xmath18  k , overionized bubble _    in this scenario ,",
    "a series of supernova explosions and winds has created a hot , youthful bubble .",
    "it is assumed that the bubble expanded rapidly as it broke into a low density region .",
    "the rapid , adiabatic expansion cooled the bubble faster than the ions could recombine , so that the gas now has a temperture of 4 to @xmath5  k , but still highly ionized and x - ray emissive @xcite . because the transition zones between the bubble plasma and the embedded cool clouds will be cooler than the collisional ionizational equilibrium temperature for o  , they need not be rich in o  ions .    in the @xcite model , the local bubble has a radius of 115 pc , density ( of electrons , breitschwerdt , personal communication ) of @xmath42 @xmath6 , and pressure ( presumably thermal ) of @xmath43  k  @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the plasma temperature is approximately @xmath44  k. lacking published estimates for the o  intensity , we will calculate it from the above values and the emission equation in @xcite .",
    "the intensity calculation also requires the ratio of electrons to hydrogen nuclei in a solar abundance plasma ( 1.2 ) , the solar abundance of oxygen ( @xmath45 , @xcite ) , and an estimate of the fraction of oxygen atoms in the o  ionization level . during the plasma s extraordinary cooling history",
    ", it has experienced some degree of recombination , as evidenced by the strong lines of c  , o  , and o  in @xcite s predictions . here",
    ", we take the lower limit on recombinations of oxygen to the o  state as that of a @xmath46  k collisional ionizational equilibrium plasma . in this case , the fraction of oxygen in the o vi state is 0.037 @xcite .",
    "as the plasma recombines further , the o  /oxygen fraction increases , and , due to recombinations of o  , does not decrease until the most of the oxygen has recombined to o  and o  .",
    "an upper limit on the extent of the recombinations is taken from the isochoric cooling predictions of @xcite at the model temperature , again yielding an o  to oxygen fraction of 0.037 .",
    "we take 0.037 as our estimate , noting that the o  /oxygen ratio and the intensity prediction may be higher . the resulting intensity estimate ,",
    "@xmath47 photons @xmath1 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 , is more than twice the 2 sigma upper limit established in this paper . for this calculation ,",
    "the o  ions are assumed to be mixed throughout the remnant .",
    "if the assumed abundance of metal atoms were reduced from the solar value , then the soft x - ray scaling relationships used in finding the model parameters would need to be adjusted to a similar degree . as a result",
    ", the model parameters would need to be adjusted , probably leading to a bigger , denser , and/or hotter bubble .",
    "as far as the predicted o  intensity is concerned , these adjustments would probably offset the hypothetical abundance adjustment .",
    "not only is there a significant discrepancy between our null result and the intensity calculated from the model , there is a factor of 20 difference between the observed o   column density ( @xmath48 @xmath1 , @xcite , @xcite , see below ) and the column density calculated from the model ( @xmath49 @xmath1 ) , and a significant discrepancy between the 2 sigma upper limit on the observed c  977 intensity ( @xmath50 photons @xmath1 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 ) and the published c  prediction ( @xmath51 photons @xmath1 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 , figure  2 @xcite ) .",
    "the number and magnitude of these discrepancies practically eliminate this class of models .    _ generalized multi - phase model of the local bubble _",
    "the lesson learned from evaluating the previous model was that a bubble consisting of a single , moderate temperature , overionized plasma is disallowed because it contains too many o  ions and emits too many photons from its o  and c  ions .",
    "furthermore , a bubble consisting of a single , collisional ionizational equilibrium plasma which is hot enough to produce the observed soft x - ray surface brightness is disallowed because it contains too few o  ions ( see below ) .",
    "in contrast , suppose the local bubble contains multiple distinct plasmas , a collisional ionizational equilibrium , million degree , x - ray emissive plasma and a several hundred thousand degree , o  -rich plasma .",
