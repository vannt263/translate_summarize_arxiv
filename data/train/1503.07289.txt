    "the md simulation is applicable for a wide variety of complex liquids and soft matters consist of the complicated molecules such as the polymer molecules and the biological molecules .",
    "however , due to the enormous computational time to calculate the dynamics of all the molecules , the md simulation is not yet applicable to problems which concern mesoscopic and macroscopic scales motions far beyond the molecular size , where the dynamics of molecules are strongly coupled to the macroscopic transports of the complex liquids . at microscopic scales ,",
    "the macroscopic transports are usually ignored and the md simulation is performed under a certain ideal environment . to develop a simulation technology to analyze the molecular dynamics coupled with the macroscopic transports for the complex liquids",
    "is a significant challenge from both a scientific and engineering point of view .",
    "multiscale modeling is a promising candidate to address this challenge .",
    "the multiscale simulation for the flow behaviors of complex fluids was first advanced in the connffessit approach for polymeric liquids by laso and ttinger@xcite , where the local stress in the fluid solver is calculated using the microscopic simulation instead of using any constitutive relations .",
    "the generic approach is also presented for the non - isothermal polymeric flows by making important corrections and clarifications to the connffessit scheme.@xcite the strategy exploited in the connffessit approach is also introduced into the heterogeneous multiscale modeling ( hmm ) , which was proposed by e and enquist,@xcite as a general methodology for the efficient numerical computation of problems with multiscale characteristics .",
    "hmm has been applied to various problems , such as the simple polymeric flow@xcite , coarsening of a binary polymer blend@xcite and the channel flow of a simple lennard - jones liquid@xcite .",
    "the equation - free multiscale computation proposed by kevrekids et al .",
    "is also based on a similar idea and has been applied to various problems.@xcite de et al . proposed the scale - bridging method , which can correctly reproduce the memory effect of a polymeric liquid , and demonstrated the non - linear viscoelastic behavior of a polymeric liquid in slab and cylindrical geometries.@xcite the multiscale simulation for polymeric flows with the advection of memory in two and three dimensions was developed by murashima and taniguchi.@xcite we have also developed a multiscale simulation coupling of md and transport equations . the multiscale method was first developed for simple fluids@xcite and subsequently extended to polymeric liquids with the memory effect.@xcite recently , we proposed the synchronized molecular dynamics ( smd ) method in which the multiscale method was extended to treat the coupled heat and momentum transfer of complex liquids.@xcite    in the previous study , the smd method was applied to the polymer lubrication generating the viscous heating between parallel plates .",
    "the rheological properties , conformation of polymer chains , and temperature rise due to the viscous heating were investigated for various applied shear stresses on the plate .",
    "we found that an interesting transitional behavior of the conformation of polymer chains occurs with a rapid temperature rise for a large applied shear stress due to the coupling of the shear deformation and heat generation under the shear flow .    in this study",
    ", we investigate the effects of changing the thermal conductivity of the polymeric liquid on the behaviors of rheological properties , conformation of polymer chains , and heat generation in the polymer lubrication between parallel plates . in the following ,",
    "we first describe the problem considered in the present paper .",
    "the simulation method is briefly explained after the presentation of the problem .",
    "the smd simulation of polymer lubrication is performed , and the results are discussed ; these results are mainly the rheological properties and the coupling of the conformations of the polymer chains with heat generation under shear flows .",
    "finally , a short summary is given .",
    "we consider a polymeric liquid contained in a gap of width @xmath3 between parallel plates with a constant temperature @xmath4 ( see fig . [ fig_problem](a ) ) . the polymeric liquid",
    "is composed of short kremer - grest chains@xcite of ten beads , in which all of the bead particles interact with a truncated lennard - jones potential defined by @xmath5 + \\epsilon , & \\quad ( r\\le 2^{1/6}\\sigma),\\\\ 0 , & \\quad ( r > 2^{1/6}\\sigma ) , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] and consecutive beads on each chain are connected by an anharmonic spring potential , @xmath6,\\ ] ] with @xmath7=30@xmath8 and @xmath9=@xmath10 .",
    "the polymeric liquid is in a quiescent state with a uniform density @xmath11 and a uniform temperature @xmath4 before a time @xmath12 .",
    "hereafter , the @xmath13-axis is perpendicular to the parallel plates , and the boundaries between the upper and lower plates and the polymeric liquid are located at @xmath14 and 0 , respectively . the upper plate starts to move in the @xmath15 direction with a constant shear stress @xmath16 at a time @xmath17=0 , while the lower plate is at rest .",
    "the macroscopic behavior of the polymeric liquid is described by the following transport equations :    [ eq_macro ] @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the velocity , @xmath20 is the stress tensor , @xmath21 is the internal energy per unit mass , and @xmath22 is the shear rate , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "hereafter , the subscripts @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 represent the index in cartesian coordinates , i.e. , \\{@xmath24,@xmath25,@xmath26}@xmath27\\{@xmath15,@xmath13,@xmath28}. here , we assume that the macroscopic quantities are uniform in the @xmath15 and @xmath28 directions , @xmath29=@xmath30=0 , and the density of the polymeric liquid is constant .",
    "law for a heat flux with a constant and uniform thermal conductivity @xmath31 is also considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq_ene ] ) .",
    "note that the thermal conductivity of polymeric liquids is anisotropic under shear flows in general@xcite , and some experimental studies have reported that the linear stress - thermal relation between the stress tensor and thermal conductivity holds.@xcite however , in the present study , we only consider the isotropic thermal conductivity as the first step because the effect of shear thinning of the viscosity is thought to be more crucial to viscous heating under strong shear flows than that of the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity .",
    "we also assume that the velocity and temperature of the polymeric liquid are the same as those of the plates at the boundaries , i.e. , the non - slip and non - temperature - jump boundary conditions .",
    "the effect of viscous heating is estimated using the ratio of the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq_ene ] ) to be @xmath32 .",
    "here , @xmath33 is the gross shear rate of the system , which is defined by the ratio of the velocity of the upper plate @xmath34 to the width of the gap @xmath3 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is a characteristic temperature rise for the polymeric liquid . in the present problem",
    ", we consider a characteristic temperature necessary to substantially change the viscosity of the polymeric liquid , i.e. , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the characteristic viscosity of the polymeric liquid at a temperature of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the nahme - griffith number @xmath0 , defined as @xmath39 represents the effect of viscous heating on the changes in the rheological properties.@xcite usually , in lubrication systems and in high - speed processing operations with polymeric liquids , the nahme - griffith number is not negligibly small because of the large viscosity and the small thermal conductivity of the polymeric liquid.@xcite for example , when a lubrication oil in a gap with a width of 10 @xmath40 m is subjected to shear deformation with a strain rate of @xmath41 @xmath42 , the nahme - griffith number is estimated to be @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the rheological properties of the lubricant in such micro devices must be significantly affected not only by the large velocity gradient but also by the temperature increase caused by local viscous heating .",
    "to predict the rheological properties of the polymeric liquid in these systems , one must consider the temperature variation in eq .",
    "( [ eq_ene ] ) coupled with eq .",
    "( [ eq_flow ] ) .",
    "the viscous heating is one of the most fundamental and important problems in the lubrication systems .",
    "however , it is difficult to analyze the behaviors of polymer chains under the coupling of strong shear flows and viscous heating with using the conventional simulation technologies . as is seen in eq .",
    "[ eq_nahme - griffith ] , the effect of viscous heating on the temperature and behaviors of polymer chains is enhanced as the system size @xmath3 is large .",
    "thus , the thermal lubrication is one of the typical problems that the macroscopic transports and microscopic molecular dynamics are strongly interacted each other .",
    "we solve this problem by using the synchronized molecular - dynamics ( smd ) simulation which was proposed recently by authors@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we briefly explain the smd method .",
    "the molecular dynamics cells are assigned to small fluid elements with a interval @xmath44 and calculate the local stresses , temperatures , and conformations of polymer chains in each md cell by using the non - equilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd ) simulations according to the local shear rates @xmath22 .",
    "( see fig . [ fig_problem](b ) ) .",
    "the nemd simulations are performed independently in each md cell for a certain time duration @xmath45 , but at each time interval @xmath45 , the nemd simulations are synchronized to satisfy the macroscopic heat- and momentum - transport equations eq .",
    "( [ eq_macro ] ) .",
    "thus , the couplings of the shear flow , viscous heading , and conformational dynamics of polymer chains are autonomously calculated in each md cell with satisfying the macroscopic heat- and momentum - transfers .",
    "in this study , we investigate the effect of changing the thermal conductivity @xmath31 of the polymeric liquid on the rheological property , conformation of polymer chains , and temperature rise .",
    "we carry out the smd simulations with changing the value of the thermal conductivity @xmath31 .",

    "the facts that the variations of apparent viscosity @xmath63 and average temperature @xmath59 are small and the average temperature @xmath59 is a linear function of the inverse of thermal conductivity @xmath60 can be explained by the energy transport equation , eq .",

    "when the nahme - griffith number exceeds the unity , the viscosity substantially deceases due to the viscous heating , so that the shear velocity increases and the viscous heating is enhanced .",
    "this positive feedback causes the rapid changes of the apparent viscosity and average temperature for small thermal conductivities .     as a function of the inverse of thermal conductivity @xmath60 for the applied shear stresses ( a ) @xmath61 and ( b ) @xmath61 , respectively . in ( b ) , the vertical arrows show the points at which the nahme - griffith number @xmath0 equals unity . ]",

    "it is found that at a small applied shear stress on the plate , i.e. , @xmath61 , the temperature of polymeric liquid only slightly increases in inverse proportion to the thermal conductivity and the apparent viscosity of polymeric liquid is not much affected by changing the thermal conductivity since the nahme - griffith number is very small .",
