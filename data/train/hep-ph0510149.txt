    "the formalism @xcite of hadronic cross sections for the joint resummation of distributions singular at partonic threshold and at zero recoil has so far been applied to @xmath0 production @xcite , higgs production @xcite , and prompt photon hadroproduction  @xcite . for the latter @xmath1 process ,",
    "the formalism implements the notion that , in the presence of qcd radiation , the actual transverse momentum produced by the hard collision is not @xmath2 but rather @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the total transverse momentum of unobserved soft recoiling partons .",
    "the joint - resummed partonic @xmath5 spectrum has the form of a hard scattering cross section as a function of @xmath6 , convoluted with a _ perturbative _ , albeit resummed @xmath4 distribution .",
    "we have extended  @xcite the joint resummation formalism to the @xmath5 distribution of heavy quarks produced in hadronic collisions .",
    "key differences with the prompt - photon case are , first , the presence of the heavy quark mass @xmath7 , preventing a singularity in the hard scattering function when @xmath8 and , second , the possibility of multiple colored states for the produced heavy quark pair .",
    "we consider the inclusive @xmath5 distribution of a heavy quark produced via the strong interaction in a hadron - hadron collision at center of mass ( cm ) energy @xmath9 .",
    "exact higher order corrections to the differential cross sections for these partonic processes have been computed to nlo @xcite . up to corrections",
    "@xmath10 , the observable may at any order @xcite be written in the following factorized form @xmath11 with @xmath12 the partonic differential cross - section , @xmath13 and @xmath14 parton densities , and @xmath15 the factorization / renormalization scale .",
    "threshold enhancements essentially involve the energy of soft gluons . in the context of the factorization ( [ eq : crs - def ] ) we define hadronic and partonic threshold by the conditions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , with @xmath18 the transverse mass @xmath19 .",
    "it is convenient to define the scaling variables @xmath20 so that hadronic ( partonic ) threshold is at @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the higher order corrections to the partonic cross section @xmath23 contain distributions that are singular at partonic threshold .",
    "threshold resummation organizes such distributions to all orders .",
    "there are also recoil effects , resulting from radiation of soft gluons from initial - state partons .",
    "we wish to treat these effects in the context of joint threshold and recoil resummation .",
    "we identify a hard scattering with reduced cm energy squared @xmath24 and at transverse momentum @xmath25 with respect to the hadronic cm system .",
    "this hard scattering produces a heavy quark with transverse momentum @xmath26 the kinematically allowed range for the invariant mass @xmath27 of the heavy quark pair in this hard scattering is limited from below by @xmath28 so that threshold in the context of joint resummation is defined by @xmath29 a refactorization analysis  @xcite leads to the following expression for the observable in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crs - def ] ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a cut - off and @xmath32 notice in particular the last factor , which provides a kinematic link between recoil and threshold effects",
    ". the exponential functions @xmath33 @xcite are to next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy @xmath34 2\\ln\\frac{\\bar n \\mu'}{q } -g b^2",
    "\\,,\\qquad \\bar n = n e^{\\gamma_e}\\,,\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be found elsewhere  @xcite , and the function @xmath37 is chosen to reproduce either nll resummed recoil or threshold distributions in the appropiate limits @xcite .",
    "we also added to the perturbative exponent the non - perturbative ( np ) gaussian smearing term @xmath38 , in terms of the impact parameter @xmath39 .",
    "we have introduced the variables @xmath40 the functions @xmath41 are the mellin moments of the lowest order heavy quark production matrix elements for either the @xmath42 or @xmath43 channel , as appropiate , the index labeling the color - state of the heavy quark pair .",
    "their explicit expressions can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the threshold - resummed result can now easily be derived , by substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) into ( [ eq:8 ] ) and neglecting @xmath4 in the last factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] )",
    ". then the @xmath4 integral sets @xmath44 to zero everywhere , yielding the threshold - resummed result .    to illustrate these analytic results ,",
    "we show for the case of top quark production at the tevatron the @xmath5 distribution for the dominant @xmath45 channel in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptspectra_qq ] .",
    "we observe that , while the resummed and nlo curves are close for small and moderate @xmath5 ( the inset provides a somewhat better view of the low @xmath5 region ) , for large @xmath5 values the resummed curves depart significantly from the nlo curve .",
    "of course , cross sections for top quark production at such large @xmath5 at the tevatron are far too small to be measured , so that our plots at large @xmath5 have only theoretical interest . for such large @xmath5 values , the hadronic threshold , defined in eq .",
    ", approaches the partonic one , where larger @xmath46 values dominate , a prerequisite for seeing significant effects for both resummations .",
    "the enhancements relative to the born cross section are shown in the form of a k - factor .",
    "threshold resummation produces an overall enhancement of the cross section that increases with increasing @xmath5 , yielding e.g. an enhancement over nlo at @xmath47 .",
    "joint resummation almost doubles that effect : the joint - resummed enhancement at large @xmath5 effectively constitutes a smearing of the threshold - resummed @xmath5 spectrum by a resummed recoil function .",
