    "damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ) are neutral hydrogen ( h  i ) gas clouds with a high column density ( @xmath12@xmath13 ; @xcite ) typically identified in the spectra of bright background objects .",
    "dlas at high redshift ( @xmath14 ) contain a significant fraction of h  i gas in the universe and their gas mass is @xmath15% of the present - day stellar mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , investigating the nature of dlas and their link with stellar components is clearly important to understand the baryon physics on galaxy formation .",
    "traditionally qsos have been used as background light sources to study dlas ( we call dlas in qso sight - lines as `` qso - dlas '' throughout this paper ) .",
    "their extremely bright flux allows dlas to be identified over a broad redshift range up to @xmath16 , even with wide and shallow surveys @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the limited information that one gathers along the quasar line of sight does not reveal the size and structure of the h  i gas , which obscures the true nature of dlas .",
    "both the rotational motion of disk galaxies and the combination of infall and random motion of pre - galactic clumps can explain the observed kinematic properties of dlas @xcite .",
    "direct identification of dla host galaxies in emission is a straightforward way to investigate the link between h  i gas and stellar components in dlas .",
    "imaging surveys of dla counterpart galaxies in the local universe have revealed a wide variety of galaxies hosting dlas @xcite . at @xmath17 , a small number of ( @xmath18 ) galaxies associated with dlas has been found so far @xcite .",
    "a small impact parameter of counterpart galaxies from the background qsos ( @xmath19kpc ; @xcite ) and high contrast between their brightness make it difficult to detect faint continuum emission from the counterpart galaxies , although some authors overcame these difficulties by searching emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) or by using a sophisticated method ( double - dla technique ; @xcite ) .",
    "sometimes dlas are also identified in spectra of gamma - ray bursts ( grb - dlas ; @xcite ) .",
    "grb - dlas have a significant merit in searching for galaxies hosting intervening dlas because grb afterglows become fainter and the contrast with counterpart galaxies increases with time .    in this paper",
    ", we report a new type of dlas , `` gal - dlas , '' which is identified in the spectra of normal galaxies . using galaxies as a background sources generally benefits us in",
    "the following ways : ( i ) we can search for the counterpart galaxies at a smaller impact parameter in any wavelength because of low brightness contrast between the background and counterpart galaxies , and ( ii ) extended background sources enable us to resolve the dla absorption features spatially or to investigate dla covering factors over the background sources by measuring the residual flux in the ly@xmath0 trough .",
    "also , another gal - dla has just been reported by @xcite , and it is expected that a large number of gal - dlas will be identified in archival and future large spectroscopic survey data .",
    "the gal - dlas will become a key population to investigate the neutral gas reservoirs at high redshift .",
    "we briefly describe the observations in section  2 , and discuss the properties of the identified gal - dla in section  3 .",
    "we use the ab magnitude system @xcite and adopt a cosmology with @xmath20 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we also adopted a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) with the mass range of @xmath23 to estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the stellar mass .",
    "we performed spectroscopic observations of photometrically selected lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) with the visible multi - object spectrograph ( vimos ; @xcite ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "the target objects for spectroscopy were selected in the ssa22 field , using the @xmath24 band image @xcite taken with cfht / megacam @xcite and the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 band images @xcite taken with subaru / suprime - cam @xcite .",
    "we applied the following lbg selection to the objects detected in the @xmath26 band image with the @xmath28arcsec diameter aperture photometry : ( i ) @xmath29 , ( ii ) @xmath30 , and ( iii ) @xmath31 .",

    "the dotted black line is the error spectrum expected from the root - mean - square spectrum of the sky - subtracted background .",

    "the spectrum of this galaxy is shown in figure  [ fig : dlaspec ] .",

    "the small panel embedded in the bottom left is the same but around the possible ly@xmath40 absorption from the gal - dla , where no flux point is used for the fit .",
    "[ fig : voigtfit ] ]    first , we fit the dla absorption at @xmath41  with the voigt function to estimate the redshift and h  i column density .",
    "we used the composite spectrum , which are made by stacking the 39 lbg spectra with the ly@xmath0 emission line ( class ae in t. hayashino et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) , as a continuum .",
    "we carefully selected the flux points used for the fit , avoiding the wavelengths where the possible absorption lines from the background lbg and the foreground h  i absorbers are contaminated .",
    "we estimated the flux uncertainty associated with each flux point by measuring the @xmath42 of the background noise fluctuations at the same wavelength in the two - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the voigt function fit for the observed gal - dla spectrum was performed with three free parameters : redshift @xmath43 , h  i column density @xmath44 , and continuum level @xmath45 .",
    "an example of the fit is shown in figure  [ fig : voigtfit ] .",
    "we repeated the fit by changing slightly the flux points used : increasing / reducing four or fewer contiguous flux points at the ly@xmath0 damped wing and including / excluding the eight flux points at @xmath46 .",
    "we finally obtained the averaged best - fit parameters to be @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the uncertainty for each quantity includes both the @xmath49 confidence interval ( @xmath50 ) and the small scatter among the different settings of the flux points used .",
    "this column density is significantly larger than the threshold of dlas ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "our best - fit model spectrum also reproduces the possible ly@xmath40 absorption line from the gal - dla ( figure  [ fig : voigtfit ] ) , ensuring the validity of our fitting .",
    "while the continuum of the background lbg is detected with high significance ( @xmath52 at @xmath53 ) , no significant metal absorption line associated with the gal - dla is identified .",
    "we put the @xmath54 upper limit on the equivalent width ( ew ) of the gal - dla metal absorption lines , resulting in ew@xmath55  in the rest frame .",
    "this upper limit on the ew , which exceeds the observed range for qso - dlas @xcite , means only that the gal - dla is not extremely metal - enriched .",
    "we show some possible dla metal absorption lines in figure  [ fig : dlaspec ] , which should be confirmed with a deeper and higher resolution spectroscopy to further constrain the metal contents of the gal - dla .",
    "one of the merits in investigating gal - dlas is that we may obtain constraints on the transverse extent of dlas thanks to the spatial extension of the background light source . as it is impossible to spatially resolve the two - dimensional spectrum of the background lbg due to both of the s / n and seeing , we constrained the covering fraction of the gal - dla over the background lbg by measuring the residual flux in the ly@xmath0 trough .",
    "as the observed residual flux at @xmath56 , which corresponds to the 10 pixels centered at the gal - dla ly@xmath0 absorption , is consistent with zero , @xmath57@xmath58jy , we put the @xmath4 upper limit ( @xmath59@xmath58jy ) .",
    "the estimated lower limit of the covering fraction is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the continuum flux estimated in the section  [ sec : dlagas ] .    by multiplying the lower limit of the covering fraction and the background lbg area ,",
    "we can obtain the lower limit of the gal - dla area projected to the background lbg plane .",
    "since the background lbg is not resolved well in the ground - based images as shown in figure  [ fig : stampimg ] , we can not measure the size directly .",
    "thus , we used the bivariate size - luminosity relation in the rest uv frame for the @xmath62 lbgs of @xcite .",
    "we assume an effective radius for the @xmath63 background lbg from the median of the size distribution of the lbgs with the same uv luminosity , resulting in @xmath64kpc in physical scale .",
    "the upper and lower limit corresponds to the @xmath65 and @xmath66 percentiles , respectively ( i.e. , central @xmath67% interval ) .",
    "we adopt the lower limit of the background lbg radius , @xmath68kpc , to estimate a conservative lower limit of the gal - dla area . assuming that the background lbg has the circular area , we estimated the lower limit of the dla area by calculating @xmath69 .",
    "we finally convert the area in the background lbg plane to that in the gal - dla plane , resulting in the lower limit of the gal - dla area of @xmath70kpc@xmath6 .",
    "we compared our size estimate for the gal - dla with dense h  i gas clouds in galaxies produced in numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite examined the stacked radial h  i density profile in the halos with @xmath71 at @xmath72 in the cosmological simulations ( see their figure  3 ) , from which we can infer the dla size as @xmath73kpc in comoving scale or @xmath74kpc in physical scale . for larger mass halos ,",
    "cross sections of dlas are clearly larger than @xmath75kpc@xmath6 in physical scale @xcite .",
    "therefore , our gal - dla area ( @xmath5kpc@xmath6 ) is consistent with the size of dlas expected from these simulations .",
    "we also compared our result with the dla size measured using the gravitationally lensed qso pairs .",
    "@xcite analyzed the 20 gravitationally lensed qso pairs and obtained the typical radius of dlas at @xmath76 as @xmath77kpc in physical scale .",
    "our estimate for the gal - dla , @xmath5kpc@xmath6 , is compatible with the typical size of the dlas along the lensed qsos .",
    "the size estimation method in studies of lensed qso pairs is sensitive to the maximum extents of dla clouds because , generally , dla absorptions can be seen in either of the pair sight - lines @xcite . in contrast , our method constrains the minimum extent of dlas because the area available in investigating the dla size is absolutely limited by the extent of the background light source .",
    "the two methods are complementary , and combining their results yields more reliable estimates of dla size .      , where the 2 , 4 , and @xmath78 contours for each image are superposed .",

    "[ fig : largeimg ] ]    we searched for the ly@xmath0 line from the galaxy hosting the gal - dla ( hereafter the counterpart galaxy ) in the ly@xmath0 trough in the background lbg spectrum ( red box in figure  [ fig : dlaspec ] ) .",
    "this allows us to constrain the ly@xmath0 line flux of the counterpart galaxy uniformly inside the vimos slit ( @xmath87 ) , where the slit configuration is shown in figure  [ fig : largeimg ] .",
    "we found no ly@xmath0 emitter ( lae ) down to @xmath88ergs@xmath8@xmath13 ( @xmath89 ) , where the line flux is integrated over 4 spatial pixels and 5 spectral pixels ( @xmath90 resolution size ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0 upper limit corresponds to the sfr of @xmath91yr@xmath8 , assuming the relation between the h@xmath0 luminosity and sfr @xcite with the correction for our adopted imf @xcite , the case b approximation @xcite , and ly@xmath0 escape fraction of @xmath92 which is an average value for all galaxy populations at @xmath14 @xcite .    for objects fainter",
    "than the vimos detection limit or outside the vimos slit , we searched for the counterpart galaxy with the multiband imaging data : @xmath24 band from cfht / megacam @xcite ; @xmath93 bands from subaru / scam @xcite ; and @xmath94 bands from ukirt / wfcam ( ukidss dxs dr10 ; @xcite ) . the background lbg is marginally resolved in the scam images and it seems to be elongated north - east ( figure  [ fig : stampimg ] ) .",

    "we consider the objects whose photometric redshifts are consistent with @xmath97 within the @xmath49 uncertainties as the counterpart galaxy candidates .",
    "the nearest candidate of the counterpart galaxy lies at @xmath98 ( physical @xmath66kpc projected at @xmath82 ) from the gal - dla .",
    "this separation is considerably more distant compared to the previously reported counterpart galaxies ( @xmath99physical kpc ; @xcite ) , while the previous searches were biased to counterpart galaxies at smaller impact parameters as pointed out in @xcite . similarly , a spectroscopically confirmed lbg at @xmath100 ( figure  [ fig : largeimg ] ) is not likely to be the counterpart galaxy because of the large redshift offset ( @xmath101 , corresponding to physical 6.4 mpc ) and projected distance ( physical 210kpc at @xmath82 ) . assuming a fainter counterpart lying within @xmath98 , we constrain the sfr of the counterpart galaxy to @xmath102yr@xmath8 , which is estimated from the @xmath89 of noise fluctuations in the @xmath26 band image with @xmath103 @xmath104 apertures and the relation between the uv luminosity and sfr @xcite with the correction for our adopted imf @xcite .",
    "this constraint on the sfr is consistent with the previously reported sfrs of the galaxies hosting qso - dlas @xcite , and then it is still possible that a modestly star - forming galaxy hosts the gal - dla .",
    "we also searched for a uv - faint counterpart galaxy in the shallow @xmath105 and @xmath106 band images , and found no counterpart down to @xmath105 or @xmath107mag , which means that neither a passive galaxy with @xmath108 nor a dusty star - forming galaxy with @xmath109 lies near the gal - dla .",

    "we examine the galaxy density environment around the gal - dla in this section . from our spectroscopic lbg sample",

    "the redshift distribution of the lbgs observed in the three surveys ( vimos08 , vimos06 , and @xcite ) and the sky distribution of the lbgs at @xmath110 are shown in figure  [ fig : skymap ] .",
    "the number overdensity of the lbgs at @xmath110 ( @xmath112 ) is @xmath113 , where the number expected from the lbg selection functions of the observations was used as the average . in the sky distribution ,",
    "the lbgs at @xmath110 seem to be assembled in a portion of the whole observation coverage , although we should take into account the difference in the fovs and depth of the surveys .",
    "then , the number overdensity of the lbg structure may be larger than @xmath114 , which is the estimate for the whole observation area .",
    "we evaluated the finding probability of this lbg large - scale structure in the @xmath82 universe , following the method introduced in @xcite with the @xmath14 lbg linear bias of @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "we adopted @xmath116 conservatively and assumed that the lbg overdensity region is a spheroid with @xmath117mpc ( comoving ) . the resulting finding probability is @xmath118% , suggesting that the lbg overdensity region is a relatively rare galaxy group in the @xmath82 universe . on the other hand ,",
    "the redshift of the gal - dla , @xmath1 , is slightly offset from the possible density peak in the redshift distribution .",
    "there are some artificial effects like the physical constraints of the slit configuration and redshift uncertainties , and we can not conclude whether the gal - dla is related to the possible lbg overdensity . a more complete observation such as an integral field unit spectroscopy or a narrow - band imaging survey is needed to investigate the environmental dependency of the gal - dla .",
    "we found one gal - dla among the 80 lbg spectra , resulting in a frequency of @xmath119% for dlas with @xmath120 .",
    "we compare this observed frequency with that expected from the published dla number density .",
    "we here assume that gal - dlas exhibit an identical incidence to qso - dlas , which is not obvious .",
    "if the size of a dla projected onto a background galaxy is much smaller than the size of the galaxy , there should be a significant residual flux of the background galaxy at the bottom of the line profile ( see sec  [ sec : dlasize ] ) , and then the absorption may not be recognized as a dla along the galaxy sight - line . in this case , the dla occurrence rate along galaxy sight - lines would be smaller than those along a compact source like qsos and grbs .",
    "we used the distribution function ( i.e. , the number density per unit h  i column density per unit redshift ) of the intergalactic absorbers of @xcite to calculate the expected number of dlas in the 80 lbg spectra : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the index of each lbg at @xmath123 .",
    "the minimum h  i column density is set to the @xmath4 lower limit of the observed value , @xmath124@xmath13 .",
    "the maximum and minimum redshift used for the gal - dla search in each lbg spectrum are set as @xmath125 and @xmath126 because we inspected the wavelength range corresponding to @xmath127  in each lbg rest frame .",
    "we selected this range to isolate the intergalactic h  i ly@xmath0 absorption avoiding the s  iv  @xmath1281063 and c  iii  @xmath1281178 absorption lines from the lbgs themselves . for three among the 80 lbgs we instead adopted @xmath129 , where the observed wavelengths corresponding to rest - frame 1070  in their spectra are shorter than the short edge of the vimos observable wavelength range ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "we finally obtained the expected number of gal - dlas with @xmath131 in our survey of @xmath132 or an expected frequency of @xmath133% .",
    "a finding probability of one gal - dla with @xmath134 ( @xmath4 lower limit ) in our survey is @xmath135% assuming a poisson probability distribution with the expected value of @xmath132 .",
    "this modest probability suggests that our finding of 1 gal - dla among the 80 spectra is a relatively lucky event but it can be explained within the occurrence rate for qso - dlas . in other words , our assumption that the occurrence rate for dlas does not depend on their background sources is not rejected .",
    "we can expect that the number of gal - dlas with the similar to or lower h  i column density than the observed gal - dla in this study will increase with archival and future spectroscopic observations , owing to the steep slope of the dla distribution function with respect to @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the statistical study of gal - dlas will open a new window on examining the dla size and properties of the counterpart galaxies such as the sfr and the stellar mass . with a large statistical sample of gal - dlas",
