    "communication of information requires an encoding of the information into a physical system . the laws of physics therefore govern the limits on processing and communication of information . by modelling real world noise in terms of simpler models , the maximum rate for information transfer",

    "@xcite . within the quantum framework",
    "this approach has primarily been developed for memoryless channels @xcite , where the noise on each transmitted state is treated as independent .",
    "however , many real world communication channels experience noise which is modelled better by errors that are correlated between separate channel uses . as a consequence ,",
    "recently , there has been an increasing interest for quantum channels with memory effects @xcite , but only involving discrete alphabets ( qubits ) .    quantum communication with continuous alphabet provides an interesting alternative to the traditional discrete alphabet based approach  @xcite .",
    "a lot of efforts have been devoted to characterize continuous alphabet quantum channels @xcite . among them",
    "we can mention the lossy bosonic channel , which consists of a collection of bosonic modes that lose energy en route from the transmitter to the receiver .",
    "the use of entangled inputs among different channel uses has found to unaffected the classical capacity of such communication lines @xcite , in close analogy to what happen for a wide class of qubit alphabet channels @xcite .",
    "however , for the latter it was argued that entangled inputs may enhance the information transmission in presence of correlated noise ( memory ) @xcite .    here , we study the information transmission through a lossy bosonic channel in presence of memory effects .",
    "the latter are modeled by considering correlations among environments acting on different channel uses @xcite .",
    "we then show that entangled inputs improve the rate of transmission of such a channel .",
    "a quantum channel that uses continuous alphabet can be modeled by a bosonic field mode whose phase space quadratures enable for continuous variable encoding / decoding . on @xmath0 uses of such a channel we have to consider @xmath0 independent bosonic modes , described by annihilation operators @xmath1 for @xmath2 .",
    "each @xmath1 interacts with an environment mode @xmath3 through a beam splitter of transmittivity @xmath4 $ ] , thus modeling losses .",
    "the signal - noise coupling is then characterized by the transformation @xcite @xmath5 let be @xmath6 the density operator in the hilbert space of the @xmath0 modes @xmath1 representing the channel input .",
    "the encoding on @xmath0 uses of the channel is considered as a mixture of entangled coherent states , defined as @xmath7 ,   \\label{psi}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the single @xmath9-mode displacement operator , corresponding to the complex number @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes the @xmath0-mode squeeze operator , with @xmath12 the entanglement parameter between different channel uses ( @xmath13 refers to absence of entanglement ) @xcite .",
    "we assume the states @xmath14 weighted with the gaussian probability distribution @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the average photon number per channel use . for the sake of simplicity , we restrict our analysis to the case @xmath17",
    ". however , by virtue of entanglement , the effective average photon number per channel use will be @xmath18 .",

    "this can be modeled by assuming the modes @xmath3 to be in the same state , e.g. the vacuum .",
    "a memory channel is characterized by non - trivial correlations between the environment actions on the different channel uses . according to @xcite ,",
    "this can be accounted for by an @xmath0-mode squeezed vacuum state , whose wigner function reads @xcite @xmath36\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is vector in @xmath24 @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 quadrature variables of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , @xmath41 is the entanglement ( memory ) parameter describing the correlated noise effects ( @xmath42 corresponds to memoryless case ) , and @xmath43 is given by eq.([ar ] ) with @xmath44 .    to go further on ,",

    "then , by using ( [ bs ] ) in ( [ wtot ] ) and integrating over the memory variables @xmath55 , we get the output wigner function @xmath56\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 finally , we consider decoding at the output by means of a heterodyne measurement , that is by projecting the output density matrix on an @xmath0-mode coherent state @xmath58 . now",

    ". a useful quantity in our case would be the relative rate gain @xmath85 which characterize the usefulness of entangled inputs .",
    "although we derived a formal expression for the mutual information , it is almost impossible to learn something by inspection from it . thus , we numerically study the quantity @xmath86 as a function of the entanglement parameter @xmath12 .    since we want to bound the effective average photon number per channel use , in practice we fix @xmath87 as the effective input photon number and we consider @xmath88 varying as function of @xmath12 ( @xmath89 ) , limiting the range of @xmath12 to those values for which @xmath90 .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "the relative rate gain @xmath86 is shown versus the entanglement parameter @xmath12 for different values of the degree of memory @xmath41 , for two uses of the channel and for an input photon number @xmath91 .",
    "for @xmath42 the behavior of @xmath86 is symmetric with respect to @xmath13 , the value at which attains its maximum ( @xmath92 ) , that is , entangled inputs are no way useful in the memoryless case . as soon as the degree of memory increases the symmetry is broken and for negative values of @xmath12 , the gain @xmath86 gets worse , while for positive value of @xmath12 gets better with respect to the @xmath42 case . in particular , for a limited range of positive @xmath12 s",
    "values it goes above @xmath93 .",
    "this clearly shows an enhancement of the maximum transmission rate due to entangled inputs in case of memory channel with respect to memoryless one ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "moreover , there is an optimal value of @xmath12 depending on the strength of the memory effect , for which @xmath86 attains its maximum .",
    "the latter is more pronounced for strong memory effect .",
    "further investigations show that the quantities @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 are all linear in @xmath0 . as matter of fact",
    "the coefficients in front of the square brackets in eqs.([imu ] ) , ( [ ize ] ) , ( [ izemu ] ) reduce to @xmath97 for all @xmath0 . up to 4 , while for higher values we only have numerical eveidences .",
    "] thus , the results of figs.[fig1],[fig2 ] applies to any value of @xmath98 .",
    "this is a surprising peculiarity of the presented model because a possible enhancement of the transmission rate is usually ascribed to the non additivity the channel capacity . here",
    "instead the memory channel shows additivity whilst improving the transmission rate .        to conclude , for our lossy bosonic memory channel model with a continuous alphabet , and for the particular procedure of encoding ( entangled states ) and decoding ( heterodyne measurement ) adopted here , we can assert that entanglement can be used to enhance the mutual information , in close analogy to what happens for some class of discrete alphabet channels ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "notice that the presented model well describes the physical situation where all the channel uses are equally correlated each other .",
    "this takes place when the block size is such that all the block experiences the same memory effect while no correlations among different blocks arise .",
    "however , the model can be easily extend to study a variety of other situations ."
