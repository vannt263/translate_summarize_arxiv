    "superintegrable systems in classical and quantum mechanics have many properties that make them very interesting models from both mathematics and physics point of view @xcite . among these properties ,",
    "the algebra of integrals of motion is non - abelian and usually it is a finitely generated polynomial algebra .",
    "moreover , this polynomial algebra in quantum mechanics provides energy spectra and information on wave functions and leads to an additional degeneracy of energy levels .",
    "this is however a quite complicated task for systems with higher order integrals to obtain the polynomial algebra generated by the integrals even in two - dimensions and in the case of cubic algebras @xcite .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the representations in order to obtain an algebraic derivation of the energy spectrum and total number of degeneracies is also a difficult problem .",
    "a method was introduced by dakaloyannis @xcite to study representations of quadratic algebras based on casimir operators and realizations as deformed oscillator algebras and was applied on smorodinsky - winternitz systems @xcite .",
    "this approach was generalized to cubic algebras @xcite and even to a class of polynomial algebras of arbitrary order with three generators @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that not all the spectrum and the degeneracies were recovered from the finite dimensional unitary representations ( unirreps ) @xcite for many of the gravel systems @xcite .",
    "more recently , we showed that these systems are first members of families of superintegrable systems involving 1-step extension of harmonic oscillator @xcite and related to hermite exceptionnal orthogonal polynomials ( eop ) of type iii ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "such orthogonal polynomials were introduced quite recently in context of sturm - liouville problems and supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susyqm ) @xcite but the connection with superintegrability was much more unexplored and only one example related to jacobi eop was studied @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the incomplete algebraic solutions were due to the construction of integrals from standard ladder operators in supersymmetric quantum mechanics and that these ladder operators admit isolated singlets from excited states @xcite .",
    "however , all the energy levels and degeneracies were obtained algebraically for the 1-step extension of radial oscillator related laguerre eop of type i and ii , but not for the type iii .",
    "it was demonstrated in another paper that new type of ladder operators with @xmath1 infinite chains of levels can be created in the case of 1-step extension of the harmonic oscillator from which a new set of integrals and a corresponding polynomial algebra provide via finite dimensional unirreps the whole spectrum and total number of degeneracies @xcite .",
    "we also pointed out that another type of ladder operators with doublet states and many infinite chains of levels @xcite for 2-step extension of harmonic oscillator exists , which showed that ladder operators for a given systems are far than unique .",
    "however , these new ladder operators for these 1d exactly solvable systems related to type iii hermite eop ( @xmath2 ) do not allow to generate integrals from which all the spectrum can be obtained for 2d superintegrable generalisations . from these results , we presented a way to construct new ladder from deleting and creating approach of supersymmetric quantum mechanics for k - step extension of the harmonic oscillator and radial oscillator both related to type iii eop ( hermite and laguerre ) .",
    "we constructed new superintegrable models and showed how from a new set of integrals and its corresponding polynomial algebra a complete algebraic derivation of the whole spectrum and total number of degeneracies can be performed using a novel approach based on the action of the integrals @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this communication is to present a review of some of these results obtained in collaboration with c.quesne @xcite and point out also the more complex patterns of the energy levels and unirreps for these superintegrable hamiltonians .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section 2 ,",
    "we present four families of 2d superintegrable systems and their degeneracies . in section 3",
    ", we present the polynomial algebras of these systems . in section 4",
    ", we present an algebraic derivation of the degeneracies of the complete spectrum using a direct approach for the four cases involving k - step extension . in section 5",
    ", we compare these results obtained in section 4 in the case of 1-step for one of the families using daskaloyannis approach to obtain finite dimensional unirreps .",
    "in previous paper we introduce new families of quantum superintegrable systems from k - step extension of the harmonic oscillator @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 where the 1d components @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in eqs .",
    "( [ ha ] ) ,  ( [ hb ] ) ,  ( [ hc ] ) and  ( [ hd ] ) are respectively the harmonic oscillator , the radial oscillator , the k - step extension of the harmonic oscillator and the k - step extension of the radial oscillator @xcite .",

    "@xmath16 with @xmath17 even ( resp .",
    "odd ) for @xmath18 odd ( resp .  even ) .    for convenience ,",
    "the parameter @xmath19 have been set to 1 in all the quantum hamiltonians , supercharges , ladder and integrals @xcite , however the classical limit @xmath20 of systems @xmath9 and @xmath10 will be only the harmonic oscillator and the radial oscillator .",
    "this is a consequence that these k - step extensions and their ladder operators are build from supercharges in supersymmetric quantum mechanics which is by essence a quantum formalism .",
    "however , ladder operators and related deformed heisenberg algebras can still be defined in classical mechanics by replacing the commutator by the poisson bracket and obtained by other methods @xcite as susyqm can not be used to generate such operators . however , as for the case of superintegrable systems , the search and classification of 1d classical systems with analog of ladder operators needs to be performed separately than the quantum case , but such 1d systems can also be used to generate 2d classical superintegrable systems @xcite .",
    "the wave functions can be calculated using darboux - crum or krein - adler formalism and are related to hermite and laguerre eop of type iii .",
    "these four families of systems generalise the smorodinsky - winternitz hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be shown using the separation of variables that the energy spectrum @xmath21 of the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is @xmath24 where the constants @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and the quantum numbers @xmath29 and @xmath30 can take the following values @xmath31 a direct calculation of the degeneracies of the spectrum given by eq .",

    "( [ deg ] ) than what was previously observed in other models @xcite .",
    "let us emphasis that in other superintegrable hamiltonians obtained even if the finitely generated polynomial algebra contains higher order terms and even of arbitrary order as for the 2d tremblay - turbiner - winternitz ( ttw ) systems @xcite , the degeneracies are similar to the 2d anisotropic harmonic oscillator . we thus need to provide an algebraic explanation for unusual degeneracies in eq.(7 ) of these four quantum systems @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 i.e. we need to obtain the whole energy spectrum and total number of degeneracies from the unirreps of the polynomial algebra and the section 3 , 4 and 5 of this papers are devoted to this task .",
