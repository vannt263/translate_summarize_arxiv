    "among the variety of irreversible models that describe a nonequilibrium phase transition from an active state to an absorbing state , the domany - kinzel probabilistic cellular automaton @xcite together with the contact process @xcite are perhaps the simplest ones . according to janssen @xcite and grassberger @xcite ,",
    "any one component model displaying a transition from an absorbing to an active state belongs in the same universality class as direct percolation .",
    "in fact , the domany - kinzel cellular automaton is equivalent to direct percolation .",
    "the domany - kinzel probabilistic cellular automaton is defined as follows . in a one dimensional lattice",
    "each site can be in one of two states , either empty or occupied . at each time step the sites are updated simultaneously and independently .",
    "the state of a given site depends only on the states of two neighboring sites in the previous time step .",
    "the rules are : 1 ) if the two sites are both empty , the given site will be empty , 2 ) if one site is occupied and the other is empty , the given site will be occupied with probability @xmath0 and 3 ) if the two sites are both occupied , the given site will be occupied with probability @xmath1 due to the rule number 1 , the state with all sites empty will be an absorbing state .    in the stationary state",
    "the domany - kinzel automaton exhibits two states : the absorbing state with all sites empty and an active state with a nonzero density of occupied sites . for small values of @xmath2",
    "the system is in the absorbing state .",
    "when the parameter @xmath2 is increased the absorbing state becomes unstable , for sufficiently large values of @xmath0 given rise to an active state .",
    "the phase transition from the absorbing to the active state is a continuous transition and belongs to the same universality class as direct percolation .",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) techniques in real space have been used successfully in studying the critical behavior of equilibrium statistical models since the work of niemeyer and van leeuwen @xcite . in these techniques",
    "small clusters of sites are renormalized into just one site according to certain rules .",
    "for the case of the ising model with the up - down symmetry , the most important rule is the majority rule which preserves the up - down symmetry of the model at each step of the renormalization .",
    "any rg scheme should be set up in a way to preserve the symmetries and the main properties of the model studied . in the present case",
    "the most important property is the existence of an absorbing state which should then be preserved by the rg trasformation . to this end , we have constructed a real space rg such that a cluster with at least one site occupied is renormalized into a one occupied site . only clusters with all sites empty",
    "are renormalized into a one empty site .    for systems in equilibrium ,",
    "that is , for systems defined by a hamiltonian the appropriate rg space is the space of the parameters , or coupling constants , that define the hamiltonian .",
    "a sequence of rg transformations correspond to a trajectory in this space .",
    "systems far from equilibrium , that is , systems that lack detailed balance , on the other hand , are not defined by hamiltonians but by the dynamic rules or equivalently by the transition probabilities that govern its time evolution . in this case",
    "the appropriate rg space is the space of parameters that define the transition probabilities .",
    "here we use a real space rg @xcite @xcite @xcite that renormalizes the transition probabilities so that one obtains a rg transformation in the space spanned by the parameters that define the transition probabilities . in the case of the domany - kinzel cellular automaton studied here this space will be the space defined by the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 the scheme we use is an application of the dynamically driven renormalization group introduced by pietronero et al .",
    "@xcite and vespignani et al .",
    "@xcite @xcite to study systems in critical states .",
    "a study of the domany - kinzel by means of a phenomenological rg has been done by bagnoli et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rg transformation was accomplished by using cells of size @xmath3 and by using a series of approximations to the stationary state .",
    "as we increase the order of the approximation better values were obtained for the universal critical exponent as well as for the nonuniversal critical quantities .",
    "our best value for the critical exponent @xmath4 related to spatial correlation length is @xmath5 which should be compared to @xmath6 obtained from transfer matrix methods @xcite .",
    "the critical value of @xmath2 along the line @xmath7 is @xmath8 which is close to @xmath9 obtained from simulations @xcite .",
    "consider a one dimensional lattice of @xmath10 sites in which each site can be in one of two states , either empty ( @xmath11 ) or occupied ( @xmath12 ) . at each time",
    "step the sites are updated simultaneously , and independently , so that the transition probability @xmath13 from state @xmath14 to state @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 these rules completely defines the domany - kinzel probabilistic cellular automaton since @xmath18    we remark that the expression ( [ 1 ] ) implies that , given the state @xmath19 the variables @xmath20 are independent random variables which in turn is equivalent to say that each site should be updated independently of the others , as desired .",
    "we call this property of the cellular automaton _",
    "one - site independence_.    in the stationary state the following condition @xmath21 holds for any value of @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the stationary probability .",
    "if we use the notation @xmath24 for the probability of having state @xmath25 at a given time and state @xmath26 at a @xmath27 time steps later then @xmath28 similarly , @xmath29 is the analog equation for the renormalized system where @xmath30 @xmath31 with @xmath32 denotes a renormalized state .",
    "let @xmath33 be a conditional probability of the renormalized state @xmath34 given the state @xmath35 which has the following properties @xmath36 from which follows @xmath37 this last expression is the one used in real space rg for equilibrium systems . taking the ratio of the last two equations we obtain @xcite @xmath38 which is the desired expression for the renormalized transition probability .",
    "due to the presence of the stationary probability on the right hand side of ( [ 17 ] ) , this is not a transformation that involves only the transition probability .",
    "however , if we use an approximation for the steady state @xmath39 such as a mean field approximation , then equation ( [ 17 ] ) provides a well defined rg transformation @xmath40 from the old @xmath41 to the new @xmath42 transition probability .",
    "it is interesting to write equation ( [ 17 ] ) in the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 from this last expression it is clear that @xmath45 is normalized with respect to the variables @xmath46 and that it can be interpreted as a conditional probability of @xmath47 given @xmath48 . in this way",
    "it becomes quite obvious that the renormalized transition probability @xmath49 as it should .",
    "one important property of @xmath50 follows from a specific property of @xmath51 .",
    "we will see in the next section that @xmath52 is either zero or one from which follows that @xmath53 using this last equality we can check that @xmath54 independently of @xmath55    we remark that we should not expect , in general , that , given the state @xmath56 the variables @xmath57 be independent . in other words , the stochastic process defined by @xmath58 given by equation ( [ 17 ] ) , will not have the desired one - site independence .",
    "this property , however , can be accomplished in an approximate way as follows .",
    "let us define the one - site marginal transition probability @xmath59 by @xmath60 where the sum is over all @xmath61 except @xmath62 next we construct a transition probability @xmath63 as being the product of these one - site transition probabilities , that is , we define @xmath64 of course @xmath63 does not coincide , in general , with @xmath65 .",
    "the final step in the renormalization procedure is to say that the renormalized cellular automaton will be defined by the transition probability @xmath63 which in turn has the form of equation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the last step is an approximation which we call the one - site independence approximation . in this manner",
    "we obtain a renormalized probabilistic cellular automaton , with the property of one - site independence , whose one - site transition probability @xmath66 is obtained from the original one @xmath67 through equations ( [ 18 ] ) , ( [ 17 ] ) , and ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "thus we understand the present renormalization as the transformation @xmath68",
    "@xmath69 @xmath70 .",
    "we use a renormalization @xmath33 in the form of a product which for the case @xmath3 reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 the rule @xmath74 ensures that the state with all sites empty will be again an absorbing state after the renormalization transformation .    to calculate the renormalized transition probability @xmath75 we consider a cluster of nine sites of the original space - time lattice : two sites ( labeled @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) at a time @xmath27 , three ( labeled @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) at time @xmath81 and four ( labeled @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) at time @xmath86 the renormalization of the sites are as follows : @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 using equations ( [ 18 ] ) , ( [ 17b ] ) , and ( [ 17a ] ) , the renormalized transition probability @xmath90 are calculated by @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath96    to actually use the above equations we have to calculate in each step of the renormalization the stationary probability distribution @xmath23 related to the old transition probability @xmath97 which satisfies the balance equation @xmath98 where @xmath13 is given by ( [ 1 ] )",
    "of course , this equation can not be solved exactly and we should seek for approximate solutions .    the simplest approximate solution of ( [ 31 ] ) is obtained by writing the following equation for the one - site probability @xmath99 and by inserting , in the right hand side of it , the following approximation for the two - site probability @xmath100 the equation becomes then a closed equation which can then be solved by repeated iterations .",
    "better approximations can be set up by generalizing this procedure .",
    "an approximation of order @xmath101 is obtained as follows . from equation ( [ 31 ] ) we write down an equation for the @xmath101-site probability distribution , namely @xmath102 @xmath103 next we use the following approximation @xcite @xcite for the ( @xmath104)-site probability @xmath105 and insert it in the right hand side of ( [ 34 ] )",
    ". then equation ( [ 34 ] ) becomes a closed equation for the @xmath101-site probability distribution since @xmath106    if the order of approximation @xmath107 then @xmath108 is obtained from @xmath109 by summing over all @xmath20 except @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 and @xmath113 when @xmath114 then for @xmath115 @xmath116 for @xmath117 @xmath118 and for @xmath119 @xmath120",
    "the renormalization transformation defined in the previous sections may be sought of as a trajectory in the space spanned by the parameter @xmath0 and @xmath121 it can be easily checked that @xmath122 implying that a system with one absorbing state renormalizes into another one with the same property . within the space of parameters @xmath2 and @xmath123",
    "the renormalization transformation may be seen as a mapping @xmath124 given @xmath125 @xmath126 and @xmath127 we obtain @xmath128 and @xmath129 by using equation ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "it can be easily checked that @xmath122 implying that a system with one absorbing state indeed renormalizes into another one with the same property .",
    "we have iterated equation ( [ 23 ] ) numerically using approximations of order @xmath115 @xmath130 @xmath78 @xmath131 @xmath80 and @xmath132 for all orders of approximation that we used we have found , in the plane @xmath133 two fully attractive fixed points @xmath134 and @xmath135 one fully repulsive fixed point @xmath136 and one nontrivial fixed point @xmath137 .",
    "the attractive fixed point @xmath134 is related to the absorbing state whereas the other attractive fixed point @xmath138 is related to the active state .",
    "almost all trajectories are attracted to either one or the other of these two points as can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "the base of attraction are separated by a line , which should be identified as the critical line of the domany - kinzel model .",
    "the separatrix hits the line @xmath139 at @xmath140 which is a fully repulsive fixed point , and the line @xmath7 at @xmath141    the nontrivial fixed point is located over the separatrix line and is attractive along a direction parallel to the separatrix and repulsive in the direction perpendicular ( a hyperbolic fixed point ) .",
    "according to the rg theory the critical exponent @xmath142 related to the correlation length , is obtained from the eigenvalue @xmath143 along the repulsive direction through @xmath144 the eigenvalue @xmath145 is the largest eigenvalue of the hessian matrix related to the transformation @xmath146 calculated at the nontrivial fixed point .",
    "the location of the critical line ( the separatrix ) is in fair agreement with previous results coming from numerical simulation @xcite , as can be seen in figure 2 .",
    "the critical value @xmath8 of @xmath2 at @xmath7 differs from the value @xmath147 obtained from numerical simulations @xcite in about 1% .",
    "table 1 shows the values of the critical point @xmath148 ( along @xmath7 ) for several values of the order of approximation up to @xmath149 for @xmath150 the figures are very close to the value obtained from simulations . in the same table",
    "it is shown the values of the nontrivial fixed point together with the eigenvalue @xmath143 and the critical exponent @xmath151 all figures for the eigenvalue @xmath143 were obtained numerically since it is very difficult to calculated the derivatives of the hessian matrix related to the transformation @xmath152 .",
    "the best value of the critical exponents , that were obtained from the approximation of order @xmath153 is @xmath154 which should be compared to @xmath155 obtained from transfer matrix methods @xcite .",
    "we used a real space rg to obtain the critical behavior of the domany - kinzel cellular automaton .",
    "the phase diagram is the same as the one obtained from simulation .",
    "the critical line , with the exception of the point @xmath136 , is dominated by just one nontrivial fixed point implying , within the ideas of rg , that all critical points along the line are in the same universality class , as expected .",
    "the location of the critical line is in good agreement with previous results , the value of @xmath2 at @xmath7 differing in about 1% from the value obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "the best value of the critical exponents is in fair agreement with the values obtained from transfer matrix methods and from numerical simulations .",
    "a way of improving these figures is to use a renormalization scheme for which the renormalization factor @xmath156 is less than two .",
    "this could be accomplished , for instance , by renormalizing a block of three sites into a block of two in which case we would have @xmath157 another way of getting better values is to use a rg space with more parameters instead of just two as we have done here .",
    "table 1 . for each value @xmath101 of the order of approximation",
    "it is shown the critical point @xmath148 ( along @xmath7 ) , the nontrivial fixed point @xmath158 the eigenvalue @xmath143 corresponding to this fixed point along the relevant direction and the critical exponent @xmath159 related to the correlation length .",
    "renormalization group trajectories in the parameter space @xmath161 of the domany - kinzel cellular automaton , obtained by using the approximation of order @xmath162 almost all trajectories flow either to one of two fully atractive fixed points .",
    "one of them is related to the active state ( _ open circle _ ) and the other to the absorbing state ( origin of coordinates ) .",
