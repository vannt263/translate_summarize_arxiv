    "in most cases , strangeness changing hadronic decays obey the @xmath2 rule .",

    "k - decays provide an important laboratory where one could learn more about this important issue @xcite .",
    "in particular , by measuring the slope terms of the @xmath3 dalitz plot , as suggested by weinberg @xcite , one can probe the @xmath2 rule with good precision .",
    "+ the slope parameters of the dalitz plot distribution in non leptonic @xmath4 decays were measured some time ago with limited precision @xcite .",
    "more accurate experimental results have been published recently @xcite , attracting renewed theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "+ the dalitz plot distribution for @xmath3 can be parametrized by a series expansion of the form @xcite @xmath5 with @xmath6    and    @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the four momenta of the pions ( @xmath9 ) and the label 3 denotes the odd pion in a decay .",
    "+ the coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 are not available from theory , but can be extracted from the experimental dalitz distribution . in the literature",
    "there are other definitions of slope parameters .",
    "we choose a definition compatible with the particle data group @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein correlation ( bec ) was observed for the first time by goldhaber , goldhaber , lee and pais @xcite in @xmath12 interactions .",
    "they found that the angular distribution of like - sign pion pairs was different from that of unlike - sign pairs .",
    "in general terms , the effect can be understood as the tendency of identical bosons to occupy the same phase space . as a consequence ,",
    "identical bosons are correlated in their momenta , opening angles distributions , etc .",
    "the impact of bec on the dalitz plot distribution in hadronic decays of charm mesons has been studied before @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated to play an important role in other phenomena @xcite in high energy physics , and on the extraction of standard - model parameters @xcite .",
    "more recently , the effect of bose - einstein interference on measurement of collective flow has been considered @xcite .",
    "+ in order for bose - einstein correlation to be present among identical particles in the final state of any reaction , two aspects must be fulfilled : i ) the source of pions must be finite , ii ) the emission must take place chaotically to a certain degree .",
    "+ in the cases under study _",
    "i.e. _ , the decays : + @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    and    @xmath16    condition i ) is satisfied by the need of form factors to describe the decay , and the well known finite size of the k mesons @xcite . + in hadronic decays , such as those under study , particles are produced partially through hadronization in a not a entirely coherent process .",
    "the incoherence although small , we believe it to be sufficient to satisfy condition ii ) , requiered for the presence of correlation .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the decay .",
    "the bubble represents the space - time region where particles are produced .",
    "correlations among the decay products of a particle and the pions produced in the main reaction , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , will not be considered here .",
    "we will rather regard the decay itself as a particle production process in which interference may arise .",
    "+ the bec are commonly described in terms of a two - particle correlation function : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the joint probability amplitude for the emission of two bosons with momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the single production probabilities .",
    "+ the bose - einstein correlation among identical mesons has been used to probe the space - time structure of the intermediate state right before hadrons appear @xcite in high energy elementary particle and nuclear collisions .",
    "+ one parametrizes the effect assuming a set of point - like sources emmiting bosons .",
    "these point like sources are distributed according to a density @xmath23 . the correlation function",
    "can then be written as , @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the momenta of the two bosons , @xmath26 represents the bose - einstein symmetrized wave function of the boson system , with @xmath27 .",
    "+ taking plane waves to describe the bosons , one obtains the correlation function for an incoherent source : @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the fourier transform of the density function @xmath30 .",
    "+ phenomenological parametrizations of the effect have been proposed . to describe the quantum interference during the hadronization in high energy reactions .",
    "for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we use the gglp @xcite parametrization to gain an idea of the impact of particle interference on the slope parameter . in a more detailed study @xcite",
    ", we will address other possible parametrizations .",
    "+ the gglp parametrization is one of the most commonly used .",
    "it is given by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the lorentz invariant , @xmath33 , which can be written also as , @xmath34 ; here @xmath35 is the invariant mass of the two pions and @xmath36 the mass of the pion under consideration .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 lies between 0 and 1 , and reflects the degree of coherence in the production .",
    "the radius of the source is defined by @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "the presence of bose - einstein correlations will modify not only the invariant mass spectrum of like - charged but also that of unlike - charged pions .",
    "this reflection of bec , known as residual correlation , has been studied so as to make sure that the reference sample of unlike - charged pions used to subtract the effect from the like - charged pions is free from any other correlations .",
    "+ in particle production processes with much phase space high multiplicity , residual correlations tend to be minimal . nevertheless , some studies @xcite claim that this is not always the case , and that using unlike - charged pions as a reference may be questionable .",
    "+ in a particle production process yielding where only three particles ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath39 ) residual correlations are expected to be significant .",
    "in this letter we want to estimate the effects of bec on the phase space of a three body decay .",
    "in particular , on the phase space of the decay @xmath39 .",
    "we will take the approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the bec are simulated by simply weighting each event .",
    "the mc generator consists of a three - body decay , with appropiate masses for the decay products .",
    "each event is weighted according to : @xmath40 where the product is taken over all pairs @xmath41 of like - charged pions .",
    "+ for cases when only two like - charged pions are present in the final state , as in the reactions ( 2 - 4 ) , the product reduces to @xmath42 however , for the decay ( 5 ) it becomes @xmath43    where the @xmath44 of all possible pairs are taken into account .",
    "we performed simulations for different values of @xmath45 and @xmath37 .",
    "the coherence parameter @xmath46 controls the strength of the effect , but does not modify the shape of the distortion .",
    "the decay is not necessarily a completely chaotic process , and @xmath37 does not have to be 1 .",
    "in fact , if hadronization did not take place during the decay , one would expect a completely coherent process in which @xmath47 , and bose - einstein interference would not be present .",
    "hadronization in the decay introduces some degree of incoherence giving rise to @xmath37 values between 0 and 1 .",
    "the exact value would be obtained by fitting the correlation function , as in the case of the source radius . on the other hand",
    ", there may be production mechanisms other than hadronization that introduce some degree of incoherence .",
    "the study of bec in particular decays may help to disentangle the production processes involved .",

    "( 1 ) , for the decay @xmath50 .",
