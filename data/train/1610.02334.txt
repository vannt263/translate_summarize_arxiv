    "the main purpose of this paper is to introduce , motivate , and conduct a detailed study of , two new ` dimension spectra ' motivated by the assouad and lower dimensions . roughly speaking",
    ", the assouad dimension of a metric space is the smallest exponent @xmath0 such that , for any pair of scales @xmath1 , any ball of radius @xmath2 may be covered by @xmath3 balls of radius @xmath4 .",
    "this provides a very important , but very coarse , piece of geometric information about the set .",
    "it quantifiably identifies the ` thickest ' part of the space , thus making it a vital concept in contexts where extremal behaviour is important , such as embedding theory .",
    "what we propose is a programme designed to obtain more information : a _ spectrum _ of exponents , rather than a single one . given @xmath5",
    ", we find the smallest exponent @xmath8 such that , for any pair of scales @xmath1 with _ fixed _",
    "relationship @xmath9 , any ball of radius @xmath2 may be covered by @xmath10 balls of radius @xmath4 .",
    "we also consider the corresponding spectrum derived from the _ lower _ dimension , which acts as a dual to the assouad dimension . instead of finding the ` thickest part ' of a set",
    ", the lower dimension seeks out the ` thinnest ' . for completeness",
    ", we also consider a third spectrum , based on the modified lower dimension , which is a simple modification of the lower dimension designed to be monotonic .",
    "we begin by considering how these spectra behave as functions of @xmath7 for arbitrary sets .",
    "some of the notable results we obtain in this direction include :    1 .",
    "there are non - trivial ( and sharp ) bounds on the spectra in terms of familiar dimensions , see propositions [ bb ] and [ bbl ] , and also corollaries [ bdconverge ] and [ bd0 ] .",
    "the spectra are continuous in @xmath7 , see corollaries [ con ] and [ con2 ] .",
    "3 .   the assouad spectrum interpolates between upper box dimension and assouad dimension . in particular , as @xmath11 the spectrum always approaches the upper box dimension , and as @xmath12 the spectrum always approaches its maximal value , which is often the assouad dimension . see corollary [ bdconverge ] , corollary [ staya ] , and proposition [ mono ] .",
    "4 .   the spectra are often , but not necessarily , monotonic , see proposition [ mono ] and sections [ non - mono ] and [ non - mono2 ] . 5 .",
    "the spectra have good distortion properties under bi - hlder functions , which is in contrast to the assouad dimension , see proposition [ holderthm ] .",
    "the assouad and lower spectra are measureable , and of baire class 2 , when viewed as functions on the set of compact subsets of a metric space , see theorems [ meas1 ] and [ meas2 ] .",
    "we analyse how the spectra behave under standard geometric operations such as unions , closures and products , see propositions [ basic1 ] , [ basic2 ] and [ basic3 ] .",
    "next we compute the spectra explicitly in several concrete and well - studied settings , including :    1 .",
    "self - affine carpets of the type considered by bedford and mcmullen , see theorem [ carpetsspectra ] .",

    ".   spirals with sub - exponential and monotonic winding , see theorem [ spiral ] .",
    "although the main purpose of this article is to introduce , and conduct a thorough investigation of , our new dimension spectra , we also obtain several results as corollaries or bi - products of our work , which are not _ a priori _ related to the spectra .",
    "we summarise some of these results here :    1 .",
    "we prove that the assouad dimension of a decreasing sequence of points with decreasing gaps is either 0 or 1 .",
    "this answers a question posed to us by chris miller ( ohio state university ) , see theorem [ seqdichotomy ] .",
    "2 .   we compute the modified lower dimension of self - affine carpets , which typically turns out to be strictly larger than the lower dimension , see corollary [ modifiedlower ] .",
    "we provide new bi - lipschitz invariants , both in general and in specific situations , see , for example , proposition [ t2 ] .",
    "we provide bi - hlder distortion results for assouad dimension , both positive and negative , see theorem [ holderassouadcor ] and proposition [ negativeholder ] .",
    "in particular , if the assouad spectrum reaches the assouad dimension , then we can give a bound on how the assouad dimension distorts under a bi - hlder map .",
    "if the assouad spectrum does not reach the assouad dimension , then we show that the assouad dimension can be arbitrarily distorted .",
    "we prove that the lower dimension is a baire 2 function , which is sharp and improves upon a previous result of fraser ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 4.6 ) ) where it was only shown to be baire 3 , see our theorem [ meas3 ] . 6 .",
    "we prove that sub - exponential spirals can not be ` unwound ' to line segments via certain bi - hlder functions , see corollary [ spiralcor ] .",
    "this provides a natural extension to work of fish and paunescu concerning bi - lipschitz unwinding @xcite , as well as classical unwinding theorems of katznelson , subhashis and sullivan @xcite .",
    "we prove that a spiral with ` monotonic winding ' either has assouad dimension 1 or 2 , see theorem [ assspiral ] .",
    "8 .   for a set @xmath13",
    "we introduce and study the ( spectra of ) @xmath14-_tail densities _ and attempt to motivate their use in other fields . just as the dimension spectra give finer information than the assouad and lower dimensions , the tail densities give finer information than familiar notions of density such as the _ banach densities _ or _",
    "asymptotic densities_. see section [ moranexamples ] and theorem [ taildensity ] .",
    "finally , we collect several open questions and discuss possible directions for future work .",
    "the assouad dimension is a fundamental notion of dimension used to study fractal objects in a wide variety of contexts .",
    "it was popularised by assouad in the 1970s @xcite and subsequently took on significant importance in embedding theory .",
    "recall the famous _ assouad embedding theorem _ which states that if @xmath15 is a metric space with the doubling property ( equivalently , with finite assouad dimension ) , then @xmath16 admits a bi - lipschitz embedding into some finite dimensional euclidean space for any @xmath17 .",
    "the notion we now call assouad dimension does go back further , however , to larman s work in the 1960s @xcite and even to bouligand s 1928 paper @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that , due to its intimate relationship with tangents ( see @xcite ) , it is intimately related to pioneering work of furstenberg on micro - sets which goes back to the 1960s , see @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the assouad dimension assigns a number to a given metric space which quantifies the most difficult location and scale at which to cover the space .",
    "more precisely , it considers two scales @xmath1 and finds the maximal exponential growth rate of @xmath18 as @xmath2 and @xmath4 decrease , where @xmath19 is the minimal number of @xmath4-balls required to cover a set @xmath20 .",
    "the assouad dimension has found important applications in a wide variety of contexts , including a sustained importance in embedding theory , see @xcite .",
    "it is also central to quasi - conformal geometry , see @xcite , and has recently been gaining significant attention in the literature on fractal geometry and geometric measure theory , see for example @xcite .",
    "however , its application and interest does not end there .",
    "for example , in the study of fractional hardy inequalities , if the boundary of a domain in @xmath21 has assouad dimension less than or equal to @xmath22 , then the domain admits the fractional @xmath23-hardy inequality , see @xcite .",
    "also , hieronymi and miller have recently used the assouad dimension to study nondefinability problems relating to expansions in the real number field , see @xcite .    since it is an _",
    "quantity , the assouad dimension gives rather coarse information about the space and is often very large ; larger than the other familiar notions of dimension such as hausdorff and box - counting dimension .",
    "also , despite the fact that two scales are used ( @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) , the assouad dimension returns no information about which scales ` see ' the maximal exponential growth rate described above . in this paper",
    "we propose a programme to tackle these problems : we fix the relationship between the scales @xmath2 and @xmath4 and then compute the corresponding _ restricted _ assouad dimension by only considering pairs of scales with this fixed relationship .",
    "more precisely , for a fixed @xmath5 , we look for the maximal exponential growth rate of @xmath18 as @xmath2 decreases and @xmath4 is defined by @xmath6 .",
    "one can then vary @xmath7 and obtain a spectrum of dimensions for the given metric space which can be viewed as providing finer geometric information about the ( lack of ) homogeneity present and a more complete picture of how the space scales .",
    "one may also be able to pick out @xmath7s which ` see ' the assouad dimension , i.e. , values where this spectrum reaches the true assouad dimension .",
    "if the assouad dimension is ` seen ' by the spectrum , then we are able to glean more information about the assouad dimension because the spectrum is generally better behaved than the assouad dimension , see for example theorem [ holderassouadcor ] .",
    "another key motivation of this work is that the finer the information we are able glean concerning the scaling structure of the space , the better the applications should be . in particular , we believe that the notions we introduce and study here should bear fruit in other areas where the assouad dimension already plays a role ; such as embedding theory , quasi - conformal geometry , and geometric measure theory .",
    "we begin by recalling the precise definition of the assouad dimension , which serves to motivate our new definition .",
    "let @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a fixed metric space ; which will often be a compact subset of euclidean space .",
    "the _ assouad dimension _ of @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 as described above , we will modify this definition by taking the infimum over the less restrictive condition that the scaling property only holds for scales @xmath28 satisfying a particular relationship . for @xmath5 , we define @xmath29 we are particularly interested in the function @xmath30 which we refer to as the _ assouad spectrum _ ( of @xmath26 ) .",
    "for convenience we extend @xmath31 to @xmath32 by setting @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "of course there are many other ways to fix the relationship between the scales @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , it turns out that if one wants to develop a rich theory , the most natural way to do this is what we propose here . see the discussion in section [ diffdirdisc ] at the end of the paper for more details on this point .",
    "the lower dimension , introduced by larman @xcite , is the natural dual of the assouad dimension .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an in - depth discussion of the relationships and differences between these dimensions .",
    "let @xmath24 be as above .",
    "the _ lower dimension _ of @xmath26 is defined by @xmath35 due to the local nature of this definition , it has many strange properties which may not be seen as desirable for a ` dimension ' to satisfy .",
    "for example , it is not monotone as the presence of a single isolated point renders the lower dimension 0 , and it may take the value 0 for an open subset of euclidean space , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 2.5 ) .",
    "one can modify the definition to get rid of these ( perhaps ) strange properties by defining the _ modified lower dimension _ by @xmath36 for @xmath5 , we define @xmath37 again , we are particularly interested in the function @xmath38 which we refer to as the _ lower spectrum _ ( of @xmath26 ) .",
    "as before , we extend @xmath39 to @xmath32 by setting @xmath40 for @xmath34 . we can also modify this definition to force it to be monotone and to take on the ambient spatial dimension for open sets . the _ modified lower spectrum _ ( of @xmath26 ) is defined by @xmath41",
    "the key motivation behind these new definitions is that the geometric information provided by the assouad and lower dimensions is too coarse .",
    "we gain more information by understanding how the inhomogeneity depends on the scales one is considering .",
    "alternative approaches to getting more out of these dimensions are possible . for example , fraser and todd @xcite recently considered a quantitative analysis of the assouad dimension where they looked to understand how inhomogeneity varies in space , i.e. as one changes the point @xmath42 around which one is trying to cover the set .",
    "they found that for some natural examples this inhomogeneity could be described by a _",
    "large deviations principle_. in a certain sense our approach is dual to that of @xcite in that we put restrictions on _ scale _ but still maximise over _ space _ , whereas in @xcite restrictions were put on _ space _ , but the quantities were still maximised over all _",
    "here we summarise some notation which we will use throughout the paper .    for real - valued functions @xmath43 , we write @xmath44 to mean that there exists a universal constant @xmath45 , independent of @xmath46 , such that @xmath47",
    ". some readers may be more familiar with the notation @xmath48 , which is sometimes more convenient and means the same thing .",
    "similarly , @xmath49 means that @xmath50 with a universal constant independent of @xmath46 . if both @xmath44 and @xmath49 , then we write @xmath51",
    ". generally one should think of @xmath46 as being the tuple consisting of all variables in the expression @xmath52 .",
    "usually @xmath46 will be a length scale but could sometimes also incorporate points in the metric space in question or other independent length scales .    for a real number @xmath53 , we write @xmath54 to denote a real number that is strictly larger than @xmath53 but can be chosen as close to @xmath53 as we wish .",
    "similarly , we write @xmath55 to denote a real number that is strictly less than @xmath53 but can be chosen as close to @xmath53 as we wish .    for real numbers",
    "@xmath56 , we write @xmath57 for the minimum of the two numbers and @xmath58 for the maximum . also , for a non - negative real number @xmath59 , we write @xmath60 $ ] for the integer part of @xmath46 .",
    "the assouad and lower dimensions are closely related to the upper and lower box dimension .",
    "upper _ and _ lower box dimensions _ of a totally bounded set @xmath26 are defined by @xmath61 and @xmath62 and if the upper and lower box dimensions coincide we call the common value the _ box dimension _ of @xmath26 and denote it by @xmath63 .",
    "we refer the reader to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) for more details on the upper and lower box dimensions and their basic properties .",
    "note that , similar to the assouad and lower dimensions , the covering function @xmath64 can be taken to be numerous related covering or packing functions and it is sometimes convenient to use a variety of different definitions in practice . in particular",
    "we note the following general relationships which hold for any totally bounded set @xmath26 :    @xmath65 see @xcite .",
    "the upper and lower box dimensions will play an important role in our analysis .",
    "unlike the assouad and lower dimensions , we can give simple explicit formulae for the dimension spectra .",
    "indeed , it follows immediately from the definitions that @xmath66 and @xmath67 as with the definitions of assouad and lower dimension , as well as the upper and lower box dimensions , the definition of @xmath68 may be replaced with a number of related concepts without altering any of the definitions .",
    "for example , if working in @xmath21 we could use the number of @xmath4-cubes in an @xmath4-mesh which intersect the given set .",
    "another possibility is to let @xmath19 be the maximal cardinality of an @xmath4-packing of @xmath20 , where an @xmath4-packing is a collection of closed pairwise disjoint balls of radius @xmath4 with centres in @xmath20 .",
    "also , using the explicit formulae given above , we see that letting @xmath69 through an exponential sequence of scales , such as @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , yields the same limits .",
    "we leave it to the reader to show that these variations lead to the same dimensions and spectra and refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) ) for more details .",
    "it is often useful to adopt these different definitions of @xmath68 , in particular when considering measureability properties in section [ borelsect ] .    in practice ,",
    "one often obtains estimates for @xmath72 and the following simple lemma is useful in summarising what one can deduce from such estimates .",
    "we will often use it without referring to it explicitly .",
    "[ n2d ] let @xmath26 be a given set and suppose that for some @xmath73 we have    @xmath74    for some @xmath5 and all sufficiently small @xmath75 then we have    @xmath76    if for some @xmath5 we can find a sequence @xmath77 for @xmath78 such that    @xmath79    then we have    @xmath80    in the following arguments , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the implied constants relating to the use of @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the hypothesis . in particular , they do not depend on @xmath2 . then",
    ", directly from the explicit formula above , we get : @xmath85 in the other direction we have @xmath86 which completes the proof .",
    "we also provide the dual version of lemma [ n2d ] , which we state without proof .",

    "[ bb ] let @xmath26 be a totally bounded set .",

    "@xmath94    this implies that @xmath95    whenever we have a covering of @xmath26 by @xmath2-balls , if we further cover each @xmath2-ball with @xmath96-balls then we get a cover of @xmath26 by @xmath96-balls and an upper bound for @xmath97 .",
    "we can cover @xmath26 with @xmath98 @xmath2-balls , and all those @xmath2-balls can be covered by at most @xmath99 many @xmath100-balls , therefore @xmath101 and so @xmath102 since @xmath103 for all small enough @xmath2 and @xmath104 for infinitely many @xmath105 we have that @xmath106 holds for a sequence of @xmath107 .",
    "it now follows from lemma [ n2d ] and ( [ estimatebb1 ] ) and ( [ estimatebb2 ] ) that @xmath108 finally , since @xmath109 is a trivial upper bound for @xmath110 for all @xmath111 , the desired conclusion follows .",
    "the above estimates show that if the upper box and assouad dimensions of a set coincide , then the assouad spectrum is constantly equal to the common value for all @xmath5 .",
    "such sets are highly homogeneous and therefore it is not surprising that the assouad spectrum yields no new information .",
    "fortunately , sets with distinct upper box and assouad dimensions abound and we will focus on such examples . in this case , the above estimates show that , in some sense , the assouad spectrum _ must _ yield finer information than the upper box and assouad dimensions alone . indeed , the only way the spectrum can be constant is if it is constantly equal to the upper box dimension , but such behaviour would be quite striking since the definition is more similar to the assouad dimension than the upper box dimension . in such cases ,",
    "the assouad dimension is not ` seen ' by any @xmath7 and this shows that to obtain the assouad dimension , one must use a complicated collection of pairs @xmath112 without any clear exponential relationship .",
    "we also note that these basic bounds are sharp .",
    "we show that for a natural family of decreasing sequences , the upper bound is always obtained , see section [ sequencessect ] , and for mandelbrot percolation the ( constant ) lower bound is always obtained almost surely conditioned on non - extinction , see section [ mandelbrotsect ] .",
    "we also note that for many natural examples the spectrum lies strictly between these upper and lower bounds , for example for the self - affine carpets studied by bedford and mcmullen , see section [ carpetssect ] .    letting @xmath113 in the previous result we obtain the following corollary :    [ bdconverge ] for any totally bounded set @xmath26",

    "we note that one can not say anything as succinct about the limit of @xmath115 as @xmath12 , but it is often the case that @xmath116 in some ( sometimes large ) interval to the left of @xmath117 .",
    "proposition [ bb ] has the following immediate corollary , which at first sight looks surprising since the definition of the assouad spectrum does not appear to depend so sensitively on the upper box dimension .",

    "the above formulae are obtained by considering the 4 cases above along with estimates derived from the definition of @xmath369 .",
    "this gives an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath1381 which allows one to apply lemmas [ n2d ] and [ ln2d ] .",

    "they are not monotonic and , moreover , there are infinitely many disjoint intervals within which they fail to be monotonic .",
    "2 .   they have infinitely many points of non - differentiability .",
    "this follows immediately by combining lemmas [ l1 ] and [ l2 ] with the fact that the spectra are continuous , see propositions [ con ] and [ con2 ] .",
    "in this section we collect several open questions concerning the work we have presented in this paper .",
    "corollary [ con ] and theorem [ con2 ] show that all of the spectra we consider are continuous in @xmath7 , but many of our examples exhibit phase transitions , preventing the spectra from being any more regular globally .",
    "however , in all of our examples the spectra are piecewise analytic and we wonder if this is always the case , either with finitely or countably many phase transitions .      in corollary",
    "[ spectralip ] and theorem [ con2 ] we proved that the assouad and lower spectra are lipschitz when restricted to any closed subinterval of @xmath140 .",
    "however , we have not ruled out the possibility of examples where the spectra exhibit less regularity on the whole domain .",
    "in proposition [ basic2sep ] we proved that the modified lower dimension is stable under finite unions , provided the sets are ` properly separated ' .",
    "note that this property does not hold for the lower dimension .",
    "we were unable to determine if the ` properly separated ' condition can be dropped .",
    "theorems [ meas1]-[meas3 ] proved that the assouad and lower spectra are of baire class 2 and thus borel measureable .",
    "we have not been able to determine if the modified lower dimension or modified lower spectrum are borel measureable .",
    "recall that in our study of spirals with sub - exponential and monotonic winding we needed to make the additional assumption that the upper box dimension was strictly larger than 1 . at first this might seem like a strange assumption , but it is the analogue of assuming that a decreasing sequence has positive box dimension .",
    "indeed , if a set has box dimension 0 , then corollary [ bd0 ] tells us that the assouad spectrum is constantly equal to 0 , thus hiding any strange properties which may occur in that case .",
    "there is no analogous result here and it remains an interesting problem to investigate what can happen when the box dimension of a spiral is 1 .",
    "we suspect that theorem [ spiral ] no longer holds and that other phenomena are possible .      also on the topic of spirals",
    ", we proved that if a straight line segment is mapped to a spiral with sub - exponential and monotonic winding , then the hlder exponent of that map must satisfy certain restrictions based on the upper box dimension of the spiral",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the sharpness of this result .",
    "a first step in this investigation could be the following question .",
    "can a spiral with sub - exponential and monotonic winding and with upper box dimension strictly larger than 1 be mapped to line segment by a bi - hlder map ?",
    "if so , what are the sharp bounds on the hlder exponents ?",
    "one of our main examples involved self - affine carpets of the type introduced by bedford and mcmullen .",
    "these results could be generalised in several interesting directions .",
    "firstly , to the planar carpets of lalley - gatzouras @xcite and baraski @xcite . here",
    "the matrices associated with the affine maps need not be the same for each map and this presents serious complications .",
    "we expect different types of spectra to be possible , for example with more than one phase transition , see section [ lalley - gatzs ]",
    ".      another possibility would be to consider the higher dimensional analogue of the bedford - mcmullen carpets ; the so - called _ self - affine sponges_. these were first considered by kenyon and peres @xcite and recently the assouad and lower dimensions were computed by fraser and howroyd @xcite . here",
    "the maps act on @xmath1236-dimensional space ( instead of the plane ) and the matrices associated to the affine maps are constantly equal to @xmath1420 for some fixed integers @xmath1421 .",
    "again we believe that more complicated spectra are possible , with phase transitions possibly occurring at the @xmath1422 ( possibly distinct ) ratios @xmath1423 ( @xmath1424 ) . recall that in the ( non - uniform fibres ) planar case precisely one phase transition occurs at the ratio @xmath1425 .",
    "self - similar and self - conformal sets with complicated overlaps provide an important class of sets with distinct box and assouad dimensions , recall ( * ? ? ? * section 3.1)and subsequent developments @xcite . in section [ self - similarsect ]",
    "we gave non - trivial upper bounds on the assouad spectrum in terms of local dimensions of certain gibbs measures , but it would be interesting to take this work further",
    ". it would clearly be valuable to find non - trivial _ lower _ bounds ( if they exist ) or to compute the spectrum explicitly for specific examples .",
    "two specific examples come to mind : the example from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1 ) where the overlaps are complicated by the fact that two of the maps share a fixed point ; and the example considered by bandt and graf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ( 5 ) ) where the translations are chosen carefully to ensure that the weak separation condition fails despite all the contraction ratios being the same .      given corollary [ sscor ] and the various folklore conjectures on self - similar sets and measures with overlaps",
    ", we conjecture that in fact for any self - similar and self - conformal set the assouad spectrum coincides with the upper box dimension .",
    "in section [ mandelbrotsect ] we considered an important random mode : mandelbrot percolation . here",
    "the assouad spectrum behaved rather differently from many of the deterministic models we investigated : the spectrum was constantly equal to the box dimension despite the assouad dimension generally being much larger .",
    "there are many other natural and important methods for producing random fractals and it would be interesting to see if randomness tends to lead to this phenomenon more generally .",
    "one possible interpretation of this is as follows .",
    "once you introduce randomness the assouad dimension is generically very large because almost surely you eventually see extremal behaviour .",
    "however , to the assouad spectrum to be large , one needs to control ( in some precise sense ) how long you have to wait to see the extremal behaviour .        in section [ moranexamples ]",
    "we introduced the @xmath14-_tail densities _ as potential tools for studying density properties of subsets of @xmath1186 .",
    "the definitions seem very natural to us , but we have been unable to find reference to them in the literature .",
    "it would be interesting to find applications in , or connections to , other areas , or to study these finer density functions in their own right .",
    "one might ask for their general properties as functions of @xmath14 or to consider examples of sets @xmath13 which produce interesting tail densities .    once one has a reasonable notion of metric dimension",
    ", one may wish to consider how this dimension behaves under canonical geometric operations , such as orthogonal projections or sections ( intersections with hyperplanes ) .",
    "this theory is very well - developed for the hausdorff dimension , starting with the classical paper of marstrand @xcite , see also @xcite for the higher dimensional analogue and the survey papers @xcite for more details and up - to - date references .",
    "roughly speaking , the philosophy behind marstrand s theorem and later developments is that if @xmath1426 has ` dimension ' @xmath1427 $ ] , then the ` dimension ' of the projection of @xmath26 onto hyperplanes of dimension @xmath1428 should be almost surely constant , with respect to the natural measure on the grassmanian manifold . in the case of the hausdorff dimension ,",
    "the almost sure value is the largest possible , namely @xmath1429 .",
    "however , for box dimension the almost sure constant is more subtle and given by a _ dimension profile _",
    ", introduced by falconer and howroyd see@xcite .",
    "recently fraser and orponen @xcite proved that the assouad dimension does not follow in the spirit of marstrand s theorem in that it can attain multiple values with positive probability ( under projection )",
    ". it would be interesting to consider these results for the assouad spectrum , since it can be viewed as an interpolation between the assouad and upper box dimension .",
    "the key theme of this paper has been what happens when one fixes the relationship between the two scales @xmath2 and @xmath4 used in the definition of the assouad dimension .",
    "of course , there are many ways to fix this relationship .",
    "indeed , let @xmath1430 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] be a decreasing continuous function such that for all @xmath1431 for all @xmath1432 $ ] .",
    "then one may define the @xmath658-_assouad dimension _ to be the analogue where the relationship between the two scales is fixed by always choosing @xmath1433 .",
    "we have studied the continuously paramterised family of functions @xmath1434 and it turns out that this really is the ` correct ' family to consider in order to develop a rich theory .",
    "indeed it follows from our results that if @xmath1435 then the @xmath658-assouad dimension coincides with the upper box dimension for any totally bounded set . moreover , if @xmath1436 then the @xmath658-assouad dimension coincides with the assouad dimension for any set where the assouad dimension is ` witnessed ' by the assouad spectrum ( i.e. the spectrum reaches the assouad dimension for some @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore one will ( usually ) only obtain a rich theory for functions @xmath658 which have an intermediate behaviour , which leads one directly to our functions @xmath1434 .",
    "however , sets for which the assouad dimension is _ not _ ` witnessed ' by the assouad spectrum fall through the net in some sense . we propose the following programme to deal with such examples . for functions @xmath658 defined above , let @xmath1437 notice that this is not quite the definition we alluded to above because we only require @xmath1438 , and not @xmath1433",
    ". however , this seems more natural for what follows .",
    "one now asks the question : how difficult is it to witness the assouad dimension ?",
    "more precisely , the problem is to classify for which functions @xmath658 we have @xmath1439 .",
