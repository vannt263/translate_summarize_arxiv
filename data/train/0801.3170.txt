    "quantum field theories have been widely accepted in the physics community , mainly because of their their well - tested predictions .",
    "one of the famous numbers predicted by quantum electrodynamics is the electromagnetic moment of the electron which has been tested up to a previously unencountered precision .",
    "unfortunately , quantum field theories are percepted with some suspicion by mathematicians .",
    "this is mainly due to the appearance of divergences when naively computing probability amplitudes .",
    "these _ infinities _ have to be dealt with properly by an apparently obscure process called renormalization .",
    "nevertheless , mathematical interest has been changing lately in favour of quantum field theories , the general philosophy being that such a physically accurate theory should have some underlying mathematically rigorous description .",
    "one of these interests is in the process of renormalization , and has been studied in the context of hopf algebras @xcite . of course , the process of renormalization was already quite rigorously defined by physicists in the early second half of the previous century",
    "however , the structure of a coproduct describing how to subtract divergence really clarified the process .",
    "one could argue though that since the elements in the hopf algebra are individual feynman graphs , it is a bit unphysical .",
    "rather , one would like to describe the renormalization process on the level of the 1pi green s functions , since these correspond to actual physical processes .",
    "especially for ( non - abelian ) gauge theories , the graph - by - graph approach of for instance the bphz - procedure is usually replaced by more powerful methods based on brst - symmetry and the zinn - justin equation ( and its far reaching generalization : the batalin - vilkovisky formalism ) .",
    "they all involve the 1pi green s functions or even the full effective action that is generated by them .",
    "the drawback of these latter methods , is that they rely heavily on functional integrals and are therefore completely formal .",
    "one of the advantages of bphz - renormalization is that if one accepts the perturbative series of green s function in terms of feynman graphs as a starting point , the procedure is completely rigorous . of course , this allowed the procedure to be described by a mathematical structure such as a hopf algebra .    in this article , we prove some of the results on green s functions starting with the hopf algebra of feynman graphs for non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "we derive the existence of hopf subalgebras generated by the 1pi green s functions .",
    "we do this by showing that the coproduct takes a closed form on these green s functions , thereby relying heavily on a formula that we have previously derived @xcite .",
    "already in @xcite hopf subalgebras were given for any connected graded hopf algebra as solutions to dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "it turned out that there was a close relation with hochschild cohomology .",
    "it was argued by kreimer in @xcite that  for the case of non - abelian gauge theories  the existence of hopf subalgebras follows from the validity of the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities _ inside _ the hopf algebra of ( qcd ) feynman graphs .",
    "we now fully prove this claim by applying a formula for the coproduct on green s functions that we have derived before in @xcite .",
    "in fact , that formula allowed us to prove compatibility of the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities with the hopf algebra structure .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we start by giving some background from physics . of course",
    ", this can only be a quick _ lifting of the curtain _ and is meant as a motivation for the present work . in section 3 ,",
    "we make precise our setup by defining the hopf algebra of feynman graphs and introduce several combinatorial factors associated to such graphs .",
    "we put the process of renormalization in the context of a birkhoff decomposition .",
    "section 4 contains the derivation of the hopf algebra structure at the level of green s functions , rather then the individual feynman graphs .",
    "we will encounter the crucial role that is played by the so - called slavnov  taylor identities .",
    "we start by giving some background from physics and try to explain the origin of feynman graphs in the perturbative approach to quantum field theory .",
    "we understand _ probability amplitudes for physical processes as formal expansions in feynman amplitudes _ , thereby avoiding the use of path integrals .",
    "we make this more explicit by some examples taken from physics .",
    "the interaction of the photon with the electron in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is described by the following expansion , @xmath0 here all graphs appear that can be built from the vertex that connects a wiggly line ( the photon ) to two straight lines ( the electron ) .",
    "the quartic gluon self - interaction in quantum chromodynamics is given by @xmath1 this expansion involves the gluon vertex of valence 3 and 4 ( wiggly lines ) , as well as the quark - gluon interaction ( involving two straight lines )    we shall call these expansions * green s functions*. of course , this names originates from the theory of partial differential equations and the zeroth order terms in the above expansions are in fact green s functions in the usual sense .",
    "we use the notation @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the green s function , indicating the external structure of the graphs in the above two expansions , respectively .    from these expansions",
    ", physicists can actually derive numbers , giving the probability amplitudes mentioned above . the rules of this game are known as the feynman rules ; we briefly list them for the case of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "feynman rules for non - abelian gauge theories can be found in most standard textbooks on quantum field theory ( see for instance @xcite ) .",

    "in addition to the above assignments , one integrates the above internal momenta @xmath4 ( for each internal edge ) over @xmath13 .",
    "consider the following electron self - energy graph +    ( 150,60 )    according to the feynman rules , the amplitude for this graph is @xmath14 with summation over repeated indices understood .",
    "the alert reader may have noted that the above improper integral is actually not well - defined .",
    "this is the typical situation  happening for most graphs  and are the famous divergences in perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "this apparent failure can be resolved , leading eventually to spectacularly accurate predictions in physics .",
    "the theory that proposes a solution to these divergences is called _ renormalization_. this process consists of two steps .",
    "firstly , one introduces a _ regularization parameter _ that controls the divergences .",
    "for instance , in _ dimensional regularization _",
    "one integrates in @xmath15 dimensions instead of in @xmath16 , with @xmath17 a complex number . adopting certain rules",
    "holds for complex dimension @xmath18 as well .",
    "indeed , using schwinger parameters , or , equivalently , the laplace transform , one can write @xmath19 as the integral over @xmath20 of @xmath21 . ] for this integration in complex dimensions , one obtains for instance for the above integral : @xmath22 where the @xmath23 on the left - hand - side is the graph and the @xmath23 on the right - hand - side is the gamma function from complex analysis .",
    "moreover , @xmath24 is a polynomial in the external momentum @xmath25 .",
    "the previous divergence has been translated into a pole of the gamma function at @xmath26 and we have thus obtained a control on the divergence .    the second step in the process of renormalization is _",
    "subtraction_. we let @xmath27 be the projection onto the pole part of laurent series in @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath28 = \\sum_{n<0 } a_n z^n\\ ] ] more generally , we have a projection on the divergent part in the regularizing parameter .",
    "this is the origin of the study of rota - baxter algebras in the setting of quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "we will however restrict ourselves to dimensional regularization , which is a well suited regularization for gauge theories .",
    "for the above graph @xmath23 , we define the * renormalized amplitude * @xmath29 by simply subtracting the divergent part , that is , @xmath30 $ ] . clearly , the result is finite for @xmath31 . more generally , a graph @xmath23 might have subgraphs @xmath32 which lead to sub - divergences in @xmath33 . the so - called * bphz - procedure * ( after its inventors bogoliubov , parasiuk , hepp and zimmermann )",
    "provides a way to deal with those sub - divergences in a recursive manner .",
    "it gives for the * renormalized amplitude * :    [ bphz ] @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the so - called * counterterm * defined recursively by @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the two sums here are over all subgraphs in a certain class ; we will make this more precise in the next section .",
    "we now focus on a special class of quantum field theories  quantum gauge theories  which are of particular interest for real physical processes . without going into details on what classical gauge field theories are , we focus on the consequences on the quantum side of the presence of a classical gauge symmetry",
    ". such a gauge symmetry acts ( locally ) on the classical fields by * gauge transformations * and these transformations form a group , the gauge group .",
    "this group is typically infinite dimensional , since it consists of functions on space - time taking values in a lie group . for quantum electrodynamics",
    "this lie group is abelian and just @xmath37 , for quantum chromodynamics  the theory of gluons and quarks ",
    "it is @xmath38 .",
    "when ( perturbatively ) quantizing the gauge theory , one is confronted with this extra infinity .",
    "a way to handle it is by _ fixing the gauge _ , in other words , choosing an orbit under the action of the gauge group .",
    "all this can be made quite precise in _ brst - quantization_. although in this process the gauge symmetry completely disappears , certain identities between green s functions appear .",
    "this is a purely ` quantum property ' and therefore interesting to study .",
    "in addition , being identities between full green s functions , it is interesting with a view towards nonperturbative quantum field theory .    for quantum electrodynamics ,",
    "the identities are simple and linear in the green s functions : @xmath39 these are known as * ward identities * since they were first derived by ward in @xcite .",
    "the apparent mismatch between the number of external lines on the left and right - hand - side is resolved because the vertex graphs are considered at _ zero momentum transfer_. this means that the momentum on the photon line is evaluated at @xmath40 .    for non - abelian gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the identities are quadratic in the fields and read : @xmath41 the dotted and straight line here corresponds to the ghost and quark , respectively .",
    "after their inventors , they are called the * slavnov  taylor identities * @xcite .",
    "the importance of these identities lie in the fact that they are compatible with renormalization under the condition that gauge invariance is compatible with the regularization procedure .",
    "in fact , it turns out that dimensional regularization satisfies this requirement , see for instance section 13.1 of @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the slavnov - taylor identities hold after replacing @xmath42 by @xmath43 or @xmath35 in the above formula .",
    "for instance , in the case of quantum electrodynamics one obtains the identity @xmath44 actually derived by ward , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for quantum chromodynamics on the other hand ,",
    "one derives the formulae @xmath47 where the notation is as above : @xmath48 .",
    "the above formula can be readily obtained from the above slavnov ",
    "taylor identities after replacing @xmath42 by @xmath35 .",
    "they are the key to proving renormalizability of non - abelian gauge theories , let us try to sketch this argument .",
    "first of all , the different interactions that are present in the theory can be weighted by a coupling constant .",
    "for example , in qcd there are four different interactions : gluon - quark , gluon - ghost , cubic and quartic gluon self - interaction .",
    "all of these come with their own coupling constants and gauge invariance ( or rather , brst - invariance ) requires them to be identical . in the process of renormalization ,",
    "the coupling constants are actually not constant and depend on the energy scale .",
    "this is the _ running of the coupling constant _ and is the origin of the renormalization group describing how they change . for qcd ,",
    "the four coupling constants @xmath49 are expressed in terms of the original coupling constant @xmath50 as @xmath51 we see that the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities guarantee that _ the four coupling constants remain equal _ after renormalization .    the above compatibility of renormalization with the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities is usually derived using the zinn - justin equation ( or the more general bv - formalism ) relying heavily on path integral techniques .",
    "our goal in the next sections is to derive this result taking the formal expansion of the green s functions in feynman graphs as a starting point .",
    "we will work in the setting of the connes - kreimer hopf algebra of renormalization .",
    "we suppose that we have defined a ( renormalizable ) quantum field theory and specified the possible interactions between different types of particles .",
    "we indicate the interactions by vertices and the propagation of particles by lines .",
    "this leads us to define a set @xmath52 of vertices and edges ; for qed we have @xmath53 whereas for qcd we have , @xmath54 we stress for what follows that it is not necessary to define the set explicitly .",
    "a * feynman graph * is a graph built from vertices in @xmath55 and edges in @xmath56 . naturally , we demand edges to be connected to vertices in a compatible way , respecting the type of vertex and edge .",
    "as opposed to the usual definition in graph theory , feynman graphs have no external vertices , they only have external lines .",
    "we assume those lines to carry a labeling .",
    "an * automorphism * of a feynman graph is a graph automorphism leaving the external lines fixed and respects the types of vertices and edges .",
    "this definition is motivated by the fact that the external lines correspond physically to particles prepared for some collision experiment  the interior of the graph  and those lines are thus fixed .",
    "the order of the group of automorphisms @xmath57 of a graph @xmath23 is called its * symmetry factor * and denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "let us give two examples : @xmath59 for disconnected graphs , the symmetry factor is given recursively as follows .",
    "let @xmath60 be a connected graph ; we set @xmath61 with @xmath62 the number of connected components of @xmath23 that are isomorphic to @xmath60 .",
    "we define the * residue * @xmath63 of a graph @xmath23 as the vertex or edge the graph reduces to after collapsing all its internal vertices and edges to a point . for example",
    ", we have : @xmath64 henceforth , we will _ restrict to graphs with residue in @xmath43 _ ; these are the relevant graphs to be considered for the purpose of renormalization .    for later use",
    ", we introduce another combinatorial quantity , which is the * number of insertion places * @xmath65 for the graph @xmath66 in @xmath23 .",
    "it is defined as the number of elements in the set of vertices and internal edges of @xmath23 of the form @xmath67 . for disconnected graphs @xmath68 , the number @xmath65 counts the number of @xmath69 of disjoint insertion places of the type @xmath70 .",
    "we exemplify this quantity by @xmath71 here , one allows multiple insertions of edge graphs ( i.e. a graph with residue in @xmath56 ) on the same edge ; the underlying philosophy is that insertion of an edge graph creates a new edge .    for the definition of the hopf algebra of feynman graphs @xcite",
    ", we restrict to * one - particle irreducible * ( 1pi ) feynman graphs .",
    "these are graphs that are not trees and can not be disconnected by cutting a single internal edge .",
    "for example , all graphs in this paper are one - particle irreducible , _ except _ the following which is one - particle reducible : @xmath72 connes and kreimer then defined the following hopf algebra .",
    "we refer to the appendix for a quick review on hopf algebras .",
    "the hopf algebra @xmath73 of feynman graphs is the free commutative @xmath74-algebra generated by all 1pi feynman graphs , with counit @xmath75 unless @xmath76 , in which case @xmath77 , coproduct , @xmath78 where the sum is over disjoint unions of subgraphs with residue in @xmath43",
    ". the antipode is given recursively by , @xmath79    two examples of this coproduct , taken from qed , are : @xmath80 the above hopf algebra is an example of a connected graded hopf algebra , i.e. @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 indeed , the hopf algebra of feynman graphs is graded by the * loop number @xmath84 * of a graph @xmath23 ; then @xmath85 consists of rational multiples of the empty graph , which is the unit in @xmath73 , so that @xmath86 .",
    "one can enhance the feynman graphs with an external structure .",
    "this involves the external momenta on the external lines and can be formulated mathematically by distributions , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the case of quantum electrodynamics has been worked out in detail in @xcite .",
    "we now demonstrate how to obtain equation for the renormalized amplitude and the counterterm for a graph as a birkhoff decomposition in the group of characters of @xmath73 .",
    "let us first recall the definition of a birkhoff decomposition .",
    "we let @xmath87 be a loop with values in an arbitrary complex lie group @xmath88 , defined on a smooth simple curve @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath90 be the two complements of @xmath35 in @xmath91 , with @xmath92 .",
    "a * birkhoff decomposition * of @xmath93 is a factorization of the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 are ( boundary values of ) two holomorphic maps on @xmath90 , respectively , with values in @xmath88 .",
    "this decomposition gives _ a natural way to extract finite values from a divergent expression_. indeed , although @xmath96 might not holomorphically extend to @xmath97 , @xmath98 is clearly finite as @xmath31 .",
    "we now look at the group @xmath99 of @xmath100-valued characters of a connected graded commutative hopf algebra @xmath73 , where @xmath100 is the field of convergent laurent series in @xmath17 .",
    "represented by @xmath73 in the category of commutative algebras . in other words ,",
    "@xmath101 and @xmath102 are the @xmath100-points of the group scheme . ] the product , inverse and unit in the group @xmath102 are defined by the respective equations : @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "we claim that a map @xmath105 is in one - to - one correspondence with loops @xmath93 on an infinitesimal circle around @xmath26 and values in @xmath106 .",
    "indeed , the correspondence is given by @xmath107 and to give a birkhoff decomposition for @xmath93 is thus equivalent to giving a factorization @xmath108 in @xmath102 .",
    "it turns out that for graded connected commutative hopf algebras such a factorization exists .",
    "let @xmath73 be a graded connected commutative hopf algebra .",

    "the graded connected property of @xmath73 assures that the recursive definition of @xmath112 actually makes sense . in the case of the hopf algebra of feynman graphs defined above",
    ", the factorization takes the following form : @xmath113\\\\ \\phi_+(\\gamma)&=\\phi(\\gamma ) + \\phi_-(\\gamma ) + \\sum_{\\gamma \\subsetneq \\gamma } \\phi_-(\\gamma ) \\phi(\\gamma/\\gamma)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the key point is now that the feynman rules actually define an algebra map @xmath114 by assigning to each graph @xmath23 the regularized feynman rules @xmath33 , which are laurent series in @xmath17 .",
    "when compared with equations one concludes that the algebra maps @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the birkhoff factorization of @xmath42 are precisely the renormalized amplitude @xmath43 and the counterterm @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "summarizing , we can write the bphz - renormalization as the birkhoff decomposition @xmath117 of the map @xmath118 dictated by the feynman rules .    although the above construction gives a very nice geometrical description of the process of renormalization ,",
    "it is a bit unphysical in that it relies on individual graphs .",
    "rather , as mentioned before , in physics the probability amplitudes are computed from the full expansion of green s functions .",
    "individual graphs do not correspond to physical processes and therefore a natural question to pose is how the hopf algebra structure behaves at the level of the green s functions .",
    "we will see in the next section that they generate hopf subalgebras , i.e. the coproduct closes on green s functions . in proving this , the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities turn out to play an essential role .",
    "for a vertex or edge @xmath119 we define the * 1pi green s function * by @xmath120 where the sign is @xmath121 if @xmath122 is a vertex and @xmath123 if it is an edge .",
    "the restriction of the sum to graphs @xmath23 at loop order @xmath124 is denoted by @xmath125 .",
    "the coproduct takes the following form on the 1pi green s functions : @xmath126 with the sum over @xmath66 over all disjoint unions of 1pi graphs .    the sketch of the proof is as follows",
    "first , one writes the coproduct @xmath127 as a sum of maps @xmath128 where these maps only detects subgraphs isomorphic to @xmath66 .",
    "one then proves the above formula for @xmath128 with @xmath66 a 1pi graph using simply the orbit - stabilizer theorem for the automorphism group of graphs . finally , writing @xmath129 in terms of @xmath128 and @xmath130 one proceeds by induction to derive the above expression .",
    "one observes that the coproduct does not seem to close on green s functions due to the appearance of the combinatorial factor @xmath65 .",
    "let us try to elucidate this and compute these factors explicitly .",
    "let @xmath131 be the number of vertices / internal edges of type @xmath122 appearing in @xmath23 , for @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath132 be the number of connected components of @xmath66 with residue @xmath122 . since insertion of a vertex graph ( i.e. with residue in @xmath55 ) on a vertex @xmath133 in @xmath23 prevents a subsequent insertion at @xmath133 of a vertex graph with the same residue , whereas insertion of an edge graph ( i.e. with residue in @xmath56 ) creates two new edges and hence two insertion places for a subsequent edge graph , we find the following expression , @xmath134 indeed , the binomial coefficients arise for each vertex @xmath133 since we are choosing @xmath135 out of @xmath136 whereas for an edge @xmath6 we choose @xmath137 out of @xmath138 _ with repetition_.    we claim that this counting enhances our formula to the following @xmath139 before proving this , we explain the meaning of the inverse of green s functions in our hopf algebra .",
    "since any green s function starts with the identity , we can surely write its inverse formally as a geometric series .",
    "recall that the hopf algebra is graded by loop number .",
    "hence , the inverse of a green s function at a fixed loop order is in fact well - defined ; it is given by restricting the above formal series expansion to this loop order . in the following , also rational powers of green s functions",
    "will appear ; they will be understood in like manner .",
    "let us simplify a little and consider a scalar field theory with just one type of vertex and edge , i.e. @xmath140 .",
    "we consider the sum @xmath141 naturally split into a sum over vertex and edge graphs .",
    "we have also inserted the above combinatorial expression for the number of insertion places .",
    "next , we write @xmath142 and try factorize the sum over @xmath143 into a sum over @xmath144 ( connected ) and @xmath145 .",
    "some care should be taken here regarding the combinatorial factors but let us ignore them for the moment .",
    "in fact , if we fix the number of connected components @xmath146 of @xmath143 in the sum to be @xmath147 we can write @xmath148 with @xmath144 a connected graph . here , we have simply inserted 1 , @xmath149 which follows directly from the definition of @xmath150 as the number of connected components of @xmath143 isomorphic to @xmath144 .",
    "now , by definition @xmath151 for a connected graph @xmath144 so that we obtain for the above sum @xmath152 by applying the same argument @xmath147 times .",
    "recall also the definition of the green s function @xmath153 from eq . .",
    "a similar argument applies to the edge graphs , leading to a contribution @xmath154 , with @xmath155 the number of connected components of @xmath156 .",
    "when summing over @xmath147 and @xmath155 , taking also into account the combinatorial factors , we obtain : @xmath157 the extension to the general setting where the set @xmath43 contains different types of vertices and edges is straightforward .",
    "an additional counting of the number of edges and numbers of vertices in @xmath23 gives the following relations : @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the number of lines ( of type @xmath6 ) attached to @xmath119 .",
    "for instance @xmath160 equals 2 if @xmath6 is an electron line and 1 if @xmath6 is a photon line .",
    "one checks the above equality by noting that the left - hand - side counts the number of internal half lines plus the external lines which are connected to the vertices that appear at the right - hand - side , taken into account their valence .",
    "with this formula , we can write eq . as @xmath161    this is still not completely satisfactory since it involves the number of vertices in @xmath23 which prevents us from separating the summation of @xmath23 from the other terms .",
    "we introduce the following notation for the fraction of green s functions above : @xmath162 with @xmath163 the total number of edges attached to @xmath133 . before we state our main theorem ,",
    "let us motivate the definition of these elements in the case of qcd .    in qcd , there are four vertices and the corresponding elements @xmath164 are given by , @xmath165 the combinations of the green s functions are identical to those appearing in formulas .",
    "indeed , as we will see in a moment , setting them equal in @xmath73 is compatible with the coproduct .",
    "although motivated by the study of the slavnov  taylor identities in non - abelian gauge theories , the following result holds in complete generality .    the ideal @xmath166 is a hopf ideal , i.e. @xmath167    let us write the above eq . in terms of the @xmath164 s",
    ": @xmath168 in this expression , @xmath169 appears with a certain power , say @xmath170 , and we can replace @xmath171 by @xmath172 as long as we add the term @xmath173 .",
    "this latter term can be factorized as @xmath174 times a certain polynomial in @xmath164 and @xmath169 and thus corresponds to an element in @xmath175 . as a result",
    ", we can replace all @xmath169 s by @xmath164 for some fixed @xmath133 modulo addition of terms in @xmath176 .",
    "the second step uses the following equality between vertices and edges : @xmath177 in terms of the loop number @xmath178 and residue @xmath122 of @xmath23 .",
    "the equality follows by an easy induction on the number of internal lines of @xmath23 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . finally , one can separate the sum over @xmath23 at a fixed loop order to obtain @xmath179 understood modulo terms in @xmath176 . from this one",

    "let us first find a more convenient choice of generators of @xmath175 . by induction",
    ", one can show that @xmath182 where @xmath183 is a ( formally ) invertible series in @xmath164 and @xmath169 . in fact , it starts with a nonzero term of order zero . by multiplying out both denominators in the @xmath164 and @xmath169 , we arrive at the following set of ( equivalent ) generators of @xmath175 @xmath184 with @xmath185 .",
    "a little computation shows that the first leg of the tensor product in the coproduct on these two terms coincide , using eq . .",
    "as a consequence , one can combine these terms to obtain an element in @xmath186 modulo the aforementioned terms in @xmath187 needed to arrive at .",
    "as a consequence , we can work on the * quotient hopf algebra * @xmath188 .",
    "suppose we work in the case of a non - abelian gauge theory such as qcd , with the condition that the regularization procedure is compatible with gauge invariance such as dimensional regularization ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in such a case , the map @xmath118 defined by the ( regularized ) feynman rules vanishes on the ideal @xmath175 because of the slavnov  taylor identities . hence , it factors through an algebra map from @xmath189 to the field @xmath100 .",
    "since @xmath189 is still a commutative connected hopf algebra , there is a birkhoff decomposition @xmath190 as before _ with @xmath35 and @xmath43 algebra maps from @xmath189 to @xmath100_. this is the crucial point , because it implies that both @xmath35 and @xmath43 vanish automatically on @xmath175 . in other words , both the counterterms and the renormalized amplitudes satisfy the slavnov  taylor identities . in particular , the @xmath191 s are the terms appearing in eq . which coincide because @xmath192 .",
    "note also that in @xmath189 expression holds so that the coproduct closes on green s functions , i.e. they generate hopf subalgebras .    as a corollary to this",
    ", we can derive a generalization of dyson s formula originally derived for qed @xcite .",
    "it provides a relation between the renormalized green s function written in terms of the coupling constant @xmath50 and the unrenormalized green s function written in terms of the bare coupling constant defined by @xmath193 for some @xmath194 .",
    "the following analogue of dyson s formula for qed holds in general , @xmath195 where @xmath196 .",
    "this follows from an application of @xmath197 to @xmath198 using eq . while counting the number of times the coupling constant @xmath50 appears when applying the feynman rules to a graph with residue @xmath122 and loop number @xmath178 .",
    "in fact , this number is @xmath199 which is also @xmath200 as noted before .",
    "for convenience , let us briefly recall the definition of a ( commutative ) hopf algebra .",
    "it is the dual object to a group and , in fact , there is a one - to - one correspondence between groups and commutative hopf algebras .",
    "let @xmath88 be a group with product , inverse and identity element .",
    "we consider the algebra of representative functions @xmath201 .",
    "this class of functions is such that @xmath202 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath88 is a ( complex ) matrix group , then @xmath203 could be the algebra generated by the coordinate functions @xmath204 so that @xmath205 are just the @xmath206th entries of the matrix @xmath50 .",
    "let us see what happens with the product , inverse and identity of the group on the level of the algebra @xmath207 .",
    "the multiplication of the group can be seen as a map @xmath208 , given by @xmath209 . since dualization reverses arrows , this becomes a map @xmath210 called the _",
    "coproduct _ and given for @xmath211 by @xmath212 the property of associativity on @xmath88 becomes _ coassociativity _ on @xmath73 : @xmath213 stating simplify that @xmath214 .",
    "the inverse map @xmath221 , becomes the _ antipode _",
    "@xmath222 , defined by @xmath223 .",
    "the property @xmath224 , becomes on the algebra level : @xmath225 where @xmath226 denotes pointwise multiplication of functions in @xmath73 .",
    "a hopf algebra @xmath73 is an algebra @xmath73 , together with two algebra maps @xmath227 ( coproduct ) , @xmath228 ( counit ) , and a bijective @xmath229-linear map @xmath230 ( antipode ) , such that equations  are satisfied .    if the hopf algebra @xmath73 is commutative , we can conversely construct a ( complex ) group from it as follows . consider the collection @xmath88 of multiplicative linear maps from @xmath73 to @xmath229 .",
    "we will show that @xmath88 is a group .",
    "indeed , we have the _ convolution product _ between two such maps @xmath231 defined as the dual of the coproduct : @xmath232 for @xmath233",
    ". one can easily check that coassociativity of the coproduct ( eq . ) implies associativity of the convolution product : @xmath234 .",
    "naturally , the counit defines the unit @xmath6 by @xmath235 .",
    "clearly @xmath236 follows at once from eq . .",
    "finally , the inverse is constructed from the antipode by setting @xmath237 for which the relations @xmath238 follow directly from equation .    with the above explicit correspondence between groups and commutative hopf algebras",

    "for instance , a subgroup @xmath239 corresponds to a _",
    "hopf ideal _ @xmath240 in that @xmath241 and viceversa . the conditions for being a subgroup can then be translated to give the following three conditions defining a hopf ideal @xmath175 in a commutative hopf algebra @xmath73 @xmath242"
