    "the classical occupancy problem is one of the cornerstones of discrete probability , dating back to its early ages ( and hence encountered over and over again by the generations of students studying elementary probability through the evergreen hits like the birthday problem , the coupon collector s problem , etc.@xcite ) .",
    "it still attracts lots of research interest , especially in recent years , mainly due to its numerous applications spreading across the board , from sampling statistics and quality control to quantum physics , bioinformatics and computer science . for an introduction to the field and a survey of the many models and results ,",
    "see @xcite and further references to original work therein .    in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with a version of the occupancy problem in an _ infinite urn scheme _ ( first considered by bahadur  @xcite and later on studied by darling @xcite and most systematically by karlin    @xcite ) , in which the balls labeled @xmath2 are thrown independently at an infinite array of boxes ( _ urns _ ) @xmath3 , with fixed probability ( _ frequency _ ) @xmath4 of hitting box @xmath5 .",
    "the frequencies @xmath4 are assumed to be strictly positive and satisfying @xmath6 without loss of generality , we further assume that the sequence @xmath7 is non - increasing , @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the number of boxes discovered by the first @xmath0 balls ( i.e. , occupied by at least one of the first  @xmath0 balls ) .",
    "many other interpretations of this functional appear in the literature : for instance , when @xmath7 is considered as a probability distribution on positive integers , @xmath9 is the number of distinct values occurring among @xmath0 random values sampled independently from @xmath7 .",
    "since there are infinitely many boxes , @xmath9 increases unboundedly ( with probability one ) as more balls are thrown , which also implies ( e.g. , by fatou s lemma ) that the same is true for the expected number of occupied boxes , @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , as shown by karlin ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  8) , @xmath11 with probability one ( an earlier result about convergence in probability was obtained by bahadur  @xcite ) .",
    "the more delicate asymptotic properties of the random variable @xmath9 are largely determined by its variance @xmath12 .",
    "it is known @xcite that the distribution of @xmath9 converges to a normal distribution provided that @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "the latter occurs , for instance , when the frequencies have a power - like decay , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) with @xmath17 or , more generally , satisfy a condition of regular variation @xcite .",
    "( here and throughout , @xmath18 stands for a generic positive constant , specific value of which is not important . )      in this paper , we essentially focus on the opposite situation , that is , when @xmath1 is uniformly bounded ( and hence the distribution of @xmath9 does not converge to normal ) . in particular , we prove the following surprising characterization of frequencies @xmath7 for which the variance @xmath1 tends to a finite limit as @xmath14 .",
    "[ thm : limit ] a finite limit @xmath19 exists if and only if for some integer @xmath20 the frequencies satisfy the `` lagged ratio '' condition @xmath21 and in this case the limiting value @xmath22 coincides with the lag  @xmath23 .",
    "the striking consequence of this result is that whenever the finite limit of the sequence @xmath24 exists , it must be a positive integer number , @xmath25 .",
    "the issue of converging variance was first queried in the seminal paper by karlin @xcite , where in particular he appreciated as `` formidable if not impossible '' the task to determine the behavior of the variance @xmath1 without some regularity assumptions . in particular , adopting the condition of regular variation of the frequency tail , he came up with a sufficient condition for the existence of a finite limit of @xmath1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 ) .",
    "in fact , as we shall see below ( in section  [ sec5 ] ) , convergence to a finite limit , combined with the special dyadic structure of the counting measure controlling the frequency input , is a regularity condition in itself , being strong enough to ensure the result of theorem  [ thm : limit ] .",
    "( to be more precise , the `` dyadic '' feature mentioned above , pertains primarily to the _ poissonized _ version of the problem , i.e. , with randomized number of balls , see section [ sec2 ] below ) .",
    "the prototypical ( apparently folklore ) instance of frequencies @xmath7 with converging variance",
    "@xmath1 is the geometric sequence of ratio @xmath26 ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) , where one can show with some effort that @xmath28 as @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that our condition ( [ pv ] ) is obviously satisfied here with @xmath29 , hence the result .",
    "the mechanism leading to such a simple answer is due to a resonance of the ratio @xmath30 with the intrinsic dyadic structure of the variance , resulting in massive cancelation of oscillating terms ( again , in the poissonized version , see example [ ex : geometric1/2 ] below ) .",
    "recently , such cancelations have been explained directly for the original model ( i.e. , for @xmath1 ) using sophisticated analytic methods @xcite .",
    "it seems to be less well known that for generic geometric frequencies @xmath31 , the ( finite ) limit of @xmath1 exists if @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , with the limiting value @xmath34 ( see ( * ? ? ? * , page  15 ) ) .",
    "again , using theorem [ thm : limit ] one gets this answer immediately , together with the `` only if '' statement ; moreover , the same conclusion can be readily extended to sequences @xmath7 from the parametric class @xmath35 ( see @xcite ) , defined by the property @xmath36 thus asymptotically mimicking the geometric decay .",
    "( some concrete examples of distributions in the @xmath35 class , complementing the geometric instance , will be given below in section  [ sec1.3 ] . ) indeed , in the @xmath35 case equation ( [ pv ] ) amounts to @xmath37 , whence @xmath32 .",
    "of course , condition ( [ eq : rt ] ) is too restrictive for the criterion ( [ pv ] ) , as can be seen for instance by merging @xmath23 geometric sequences of the same ratio @xmath30 ( and normalizing the resulting sequence so as to satisfy  ( [ add1 ] ) ) .",
    "the following `` decomposition '' interpretation of theorem [ thm : limit ] clarifies the compound structure of frequency sequences @xmath7 that exhibit convergence of the variance .",
    "observe that by condition ( [ pv ] ) , the sequence @xmath7 splits in a disjoint fashion into @xmath23 non - increasing subsequences @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , each belonging to the @xmath40 class : @xmath41 moreover , by the `` if '' part of theorem [ thm : limit ] , each of the @xmath23 constituent subsequences brings a unit contribution to the overall limiting variance @xmath34 .",
    "such a decomposition may be interpreted as splitting the initial array of boxes @xmath2 into @xmath23 infinite sub - arrays @xmath42 ( @xmath39 ) , and allocating the balls to boxes in a two - stage procedure as follows : for each ball , a destination array is chosen independently with probabilities @xmath43 , and the ball is then thrown with the corresponding ( re - scaled ) frequencies @xmath44 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the additivity of the variance in this procedure , as predicted by theorem [ thm : limit ] , may be somewhat surprising , given the apparent dependence of the partial occupancy numbers @xmath45 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "however , additivity becomes quite transparent in the poissonized setting , where the dependence between boxes is removed ( see a remark in section  [ sec2.2 ] ) .",
    "historically , there has been some confusion about the converging variance in the geometric model .",
    "controversy started in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example  6 ) , where karlin asserted that his sufficient condition for convergence ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 ) was satisfied for _ every _ geometric sequence @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , with the limiting value given by @xmath48 .",
    "as we have seen , this is false unless @xmath49 belongs to the countable set @xmath50 .",
    "a more careful inspection reveals that karlin s condition , if applied accurately , does yield the correct answer in the geometric case , properly discriminating between convergence vs.  divergence !",
    "moreover , we have found out , quite unexpectedly , that karlin s condition ( decorated in @xcite with some superfluous assumptions and originally conceived as just a sufficient condition ) proves to be _ necessary and sufficient _ , being equivalent to our own criterion proved in lemma  [ lm : cesaro ] .",
    "we will discuss this link below , in section [ sec5karlin ] .    that there was something wrong with example  6 in @xcite was subsequently pointed out by dutko @xcite , who noticed that @xmath1 is bounded below by a positive constant , uniformly in @xmath0 and @xmath49 , hence the limit @xmath48 can not be valid at least for small values of @xmath49 ( when @xmath51 gets arbitrarily close to zero ) .",
    "however , dutko @xcite apparently claimed that the limit of the variance fails to exist for _ each _",
    "@xmath52 , thus missing the other values , @xmath32 , @xmath53 .",
    "unfortunately , he gave no details to support such a conclusion , referring to his unpublished thesis @xcite , which is not easily available .",
    "more recent studies @xcite have shed much light on the geometric model .",
    "hitczenko and louchard @xcite ( motivated by random compositions of natural numbers ) were apparently first to prove analytically that @xmath54 in the geometric case with @xmath30 , contrary to `` popular belief '' @xcite that persistent oscillations are ubiquitous in discrete random structures involving geometric distribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "prodinger @xcite gave an alternative proof of this asymptotics ( along with a similar result for a particular model of data search trees called patricia tries ) , proceeding from the general `` oscillatory '' framework .",
    "recently , archibald _",
    "* theorem  2 ) derived a very precise asymptotic expansion @xmath55 where @xmath56 with @xmath57 periodic of period @xmath58 and zero mean ( the latter function emerges in a similar expansion for @xmath59 , the expected value of @xmath9 ) .",
    "if @xmath30 then @xmath60 , and from the expansion ( [ arch ] ) it is seen that the oscillating term vanishes due to @xmath58-periodicity of @xmath57 , since @xmath61 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  a , page  1079 ) .",
    "in fact , the same argument is true for any @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , when @xmath62 and hence @xmath63 ( see  ( * ? ? ? * , page  15 ) ) .",
    "one can also wonder about conditions for other possible types of behavior of the variance @xmath1 .",
    "we shall prove the following criterion of uniform boundedness , again set in terms of the lagged ratio @xmath64 compared to the _ upper _ threshold @xmath26 [ cf .",
    "( [ pv ] ) ] .",
    "[ thm : bound ] the sequence @xmath24 is bounded if and only if there exists a positive integer @xmath23 such that the frequencies @xmath7 satisfy the condition @xmath65 moreover if @xmath23 is the least integer with the property then @xmath24 satisfies a sharp asymptotic bound @xmath66 .",
    "this situation is exemplified by the generic geometric frequencies , with arbitrary ratio @xmath47 .",
    "another example is the poisson frequencies @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , where the variance @xmath1 is bounded but does not converge : indeed , here @xmath69 as @xmath70 , hence ( [ eq : boundsup ] ) is fulfilled whereas ( [ pv ] ) fails .",
    "a larger class is that of quasi - binomial distributions @xcite , given by @xmath71 with parameters @xmath68 , @xmath72 .",
    "( to explain the name , note that @xmath73 for @xmath74 , while for @xmath75 one has , in a continuous fashion , @xmath76 , thus recovering the poisson normalization constant . )",
    "somewhat similar but different parametric family is given by the negative binomial distribution @xmath77 , with @xmath68 , @xmath47 [ here @xmath78 .",
    "note that all these examples belong to classes @xmath35 with @xmath79 .",
    "it is possible to construct more general examples using the `` decomposition '' reformulation of theorem [ thm : bound ] in the spirit of ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) , in that the variance @xmath1 is uniformly bounded if and only if the sequence @xmath7 may be split in a disjoint fashion into a finite number of subsequences , each of which satisfies condition ( [ eq : boundsup ] ) with @xmath29 ( e.g. , each from @xmath80 with @xmath81 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "we shall also address the classical question of convergence to infinity and produce new conditions ensuring that @xmath13 .",
    "note , however , that in contrast to the convergent or bounded cases , no necessary and sufficient criteria are available without extra regularity assumptions . to illustrate our results in this direction ,",
    "let us formulate here two sufficient conditions , the first of which is set in terms of the lagged ratios @xmath64 against the _ lower _ threshold @xmath26 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : boundsup ] ) ] , while the second one is based on the `` tail ratio '' @xmath82    [ th:->infty ] suppose that for each integer @xmath20 @xmath83 then it follows that @xmath84 which in turn implies that @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "examples to theorem [ th:->infty ] are immediately supplied by the class @xmath85 , where condition ( [ eq:>= ] ) is obviously satisfied for any @xmath20 .",
    "more complex examples ( not in @xmath85 ) will be constructed in sections [ sec4.1 ] and  [ sec4.3 ] .",
    "the tail ratio ( [ eq : rho ] ) can be expressed as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the discrete - time hazard rate , a key characteristic in reliability theory and survival analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter quantity also appears in the extreme value theory in connection with records from discrete distributions , where it is interpreted as the probability that @xmath5 is a record value ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the occupancy context ,",
    "condition ( [ eq : pjovertail0 ] ) is related to the `` probability of a tie for first place '' @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the largest index among the occupied boxes after @xmath0 throws .",
    "more specifically , it has been proved @xcite that condition ( [ eq : pjovertail0 ] ) is satisfied if and only if @xmath90 and moreover , if ( [ eq : pjovertail0 ] ) fails then @xmath88 does not converge at all .",
    "this , combined with theorem  [ sctail ] , shows that ( [ ptfp ] ) implies both @xmath13 and @xmath91 , which is a surprising connection between the behavior in the extreme - value range and the global characteristics of the sample .",
    "these facts equally apply to the poissonized model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] contains general formulas and introduces the poissonization technique . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    ", we connect the variance @xmath1 with the mean number of singletons ( i.e. , the boxes occupied by exactly one of the first @xmath0 balls ) and derive useful upper bounds .",
    "we also obtain here a basic integral representation of the poissonized variance @xmath92 via the laplace transform of the function @xmath93 , counting the frequencies @xmath4 in the interval @xmath94x/2,x]$ ] , and relate the threshold values of @xmath95 with the lagged ratios @xmath64 .",
    "this analysis culminates in the proof of theorem  [ thm : bound ] . in section [ sec4 ] , various sufficient conditions for @xmath13 are derived , which covers the content of theorem  [ th:->infty ] .",
    "we also show that these conditions are not necessary , by constructing examples of weird oscillatory behavior . in section [ sec5 ]",
    ", we derive a simple integral condition in terms of the function @xmath95 , necessary and sufficient in order that @xmath92 converge to a finite limit .",
    "this criterion is then used to prove theorem [ thm : limit ] . in conclusion ,",
    "we rehabilitate karlin s sufficient condition of convergence , by showing that it is in fact necessary and sufficient .",
    "let @xmath96 be the occupancy number of box @xmath5 after @xmath0 throws , that is , the number of balls out of the first @xmath0 that land in box  @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the indicator of event @xmath99 ( i.e. , with values @xmath58 when @xmath99 is true and @xmath100 otherwise ) . because @xmath101 , it is clear that the terms in the sum ( [ knsum ] ) are not independent .",
    "a common recipe to circumvent the dependence ( see @xcite for a general introduction and @xcite for details in the occupancy problem context ) is to consider a closely related model in which the balls are thrown at the jump times of a unit rate poisson process @xmath102 : by this randomization the balls appear in boxes according to independent poisson processes @xmath103 , with rate @xmath4 for box @xmath5 .",
    "further advantage of the poissonized model is that the normalization can be replaced by a weaker summability condition @xmath104 , thus allowing one to avoid computing normalization constants in expressions for @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , the normalization ( [ add1 ] ) can always be maintained by rescaling the frequencies @xmath105 , to the effect of a linear time change , @xmath106 .    in what follows",

    "let us recall that karlin s sufficient condition for @xmath527 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) involves ( i ) the condition @xmath529 and ( ii ) an integral condition , which in our notation reads @xmath530 or , after an obvious change of variables , @xmath531    throughout his paper , karlin also postulates that the function @xmath532x,\\infty[$ ] is regularly varying at zero ( see @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , this condition is superfluous and may be omitted ( in fact , karlin s proof of his theorem  2 only requires the boundedness of @xmath93 , which follows easily from condition ( i ) ) .",
    "note that condition ( i ) itself is not necessary for the convergence of @xmath92 : for instance , it does not hold for a sequence @xmath7 obtained by merging several geometric sequences with ratio @xmath26 into one .",
    "furthermore , application of condition ( [ eq : karlin0 ] ) to the geometric case ( with ratio @xmath49 ) yields the following ( cf .",

    "let @xmath533 , where @xmath534 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath535 and @xmath536 is its fractional part .",

    "however , if @xmath539 then ( [ eq : k+ ] ) does not have a limit as @xmath540 , since for @xmath541 the integral term amounts to @xmath542 whereas for @xmath543 it reads @xmath544 as a result , condition ( [ eq : karlin0 ] ) is satisfied if and only if @xmath545 , or equivalently @xmath32 .",
    "our theorem  [ thm : limit ] gives the same result , so ( [ eq : karlin0 ] ) proves to yield a correct answer in the whole range of the geometric case .",
    "this observation brings up the question about the exact relationship between karlin s condition ( [ eq : karlin0 ] ) ( or ( [ eq : karlin ] ) ) and our criterion ( [ eq : cesaro ] ) .",
    "surprisingly enough , we can demonstrate the following .",
    "[ th : karlin ] condition is equivalent to and hence the former is necessary and sufficient in order that @xmath527 as @xmath137 .",

    "amounts to @xmath548 again integrating by parts , we obtain @xmath549 where we may use dominated convergence because the function @xmath550 is bounded on @xmath940,1]$ ] due to ( [ eq : xg ] ) .",
    "thus , condition ( [ eq : karlin ] ) implies ( [ eq : cesaro ] ) , and the proof is complete .",
    "the statement of theorem [ th : karlin ] is a particular case of a general karamata theorem ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , according to which the limiting relation ( [ eq : cesaro ] ) is equivalent to either of the limits @xmath551 ( note that ( [ eq : cesaro ] ) itself is contained in the second formula with @xmath552 . ) that is to say , our condition ( [ eq : cesaro ] ) may be included in a parametric family of mutually equivalent criteria , set in terms of rescaled integrals of the function @xmath95 against polynomial weights ( the canonical criterion ( [ eq : cesaro ] ) being apparently the simplest ) .",
