    "_ , are ubiquitous and important processes in biological systems@xcite . recently voltage driven translocation of a single stranded dna through a @xmath22-hemolysin pore in biomembrane@xcite , and subsequently double stranded dna through synthetic silicon nanopores@xcite have stimulated a lot of activities as the phenomenon is rich in fundamental science involved and its prospective technical applications for detecting dna / rna sequences . while it is the attributes of heteropolymer translocation that are the key ingredients for prospective new sequencing methods , these experiments have generated stimulating theoretical and numerical studies directed towards fundamental physics of homopolymer translocation through a nanopore .",
    "an important question that has been repeatedly raised is how does the average translocation time scale with the chain length and what is the equation of motion that describes the situation adequately .",
    "approaches using fokker - planck equation with entropic barrier term incorporated in the free energy have generated useful insights to the problem@xcite-@xcite more recently partial fokker - planck equation ( pfpe ) has been suggested is the natural language of the problem@xcite . quite naturally , a number of simulational studies have been directed to test predictions of these theories@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this paper is aimed at determining the relevant scaling exponents of forced translocation of a homopolymer through a nanopore by carrying out large scale langevin dynamics ( ld ) simulations in three dimensions ( 3d ) and comparing the findings with those predicted by theoretical arguments .",
    "we look at the arguments for the unbiased case first as it serves as the reference for extending the theoretical arguments in the presence of an external field .",
    "naturally , the equilibrium radius of gyration @xmath23 of a chain of length @xmath0 , where @xmath16 is the flory exponent , is used as the relevant length scale in all the theories .",
    "the first theoretical argument came from chuang _",
    "@xcite who predicted that for the unbiased translocation the mean translocation time should scale in the same manner as a freely diffusing chain so that @xmath24 , assuming the diffusion coefficient @xmath25 appropriate for the free - draining limit ( no hydrodynamic interaction ) . in this theory",
    "it is argued that the rouse relaxation serves as the lower bound and in presence of a nanopore a smaller amplitude accounts for the slowness of the process@xcite .",
    "this theory also predicts that the scaling exponent of the reaction coordinate defined as @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 . as usual@xcite-@xcite",
    "we denote by @xmath28 the monomer that is inside the pore at time @xmath29 .",
    "noticeably , the theory is essentially very simple and the exponents are functions of @xmath16 only with @xmath30 , @xmath31 so that @xmath32 . in two dimensions @xmath33 @xmath34 leads to @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . in three dimensions ( 3d ) @xmath37 leads to @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively",
    "the theory put forward by dubbledam _",
    "et al . _ invokes an additional surface exponent term @xmath40@xcite so that for the diffusive case this theory predicts@xcite @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for unbiased translocation",
    "this theory also predicts the product @xmath32 .",
    "several recent numerical studies in @xmath43 @xcite and one in 3d@xcite supports chuang _ et al .",
    "_ , while dynamic monte carlo ( dmc ) results by dubbledam _",
    "_ report @xmath35 and @xmath36 in 3d which contradicts chuang _ et al . _ and supports their own prediction@xcite . while all the simulation studies verify @xmath44 , recent theories by panja _",
    "et al . _ and vocks _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out the role of decay time of monomer density near the pore and argues that the translocation time is anomalous up to the rouse time @xmath45 , and becomes diffusive afterwards@xcite .",
    "therefore , for the unbiased translocation the collective numerical results do not support any of the proposed theories completely .",
    "let us now look at the theoretical studies of driven translocation whose numerical verification including the underlying assumptions is the main focus of the paper . according to kantor and kardar @xmath46 , assuming @xmath47 .",
    "kantor and kardar@xcite argued that since the chain is only driven at one point inside the narrow pore , the accompanying change in its shape due to the bias is insignificant for the rest of the chain and therefore , the chain in this case is also described by the equilibrium flory exponent @xmath16 . to verify their scaling argument kantor and kardar carried out lattice mc simulation of self - avoiding chains in @xmath43 and noticed that the numerical exponent @xmath48 .",
    "they argued that finite size effects are severe in this case and the relation @xmath49 should be taken as an upper bound that will be seen only for the extremely large chains .",
    "_ on the contrary , using arguments about memory effects in the monomer dynamics came up with an alternate estimate@xcite @xmath50 .",
    "this seems to be consistent with most of the numerical data in 3d .",
    "however this estimate fail to capture the recent 2d simulation results using langevin dynamics and mc simulations @xcite where one sees a crossover of the @xmath22-exponent from 1.5 to 1.7 ( as opposed to 1.428 ) .",
    "et al . _ have extended their pfpe based theory for the driven translocation@xcite and came up with the following relations @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the prediction of dubbledam _ et al .",
    "_ for the exponents are @xmath53 and @xmath54 in @xmath43 and @xmath55 , and and @xmath56 in 3d respectively",
    ". the dmc results of dubbledam _ et al . _ are consistent with this theory .",
    "however , more recent numerical results using ld and md@xcite produce similar results which are only in partial agreement with these theories .    in this paper",
    "not only we calculate these scaling exponents @xmath22 and @xmath57 for the driven chain but provide insights how the scaling aspects are affected by boundary and geometric factors by monitoring some of the relevant time dependent quantities during the translocation process .",
    "this allows us to check how well some of the assumptions are satisfied for the driven translocation and discuss possible scenarios for the disagreements between the theoretical predictions and numerical studies . thus far",
    "these issues have not been adequately addressed in the literature .",
    "we have used the `` kremer - grest '' bead spring model to mimic a strand of dna @xcite . excluded volume interaction between monomers is modeled by a short range repulsive lj potential @xmath58+{\\varepsilon}\\;\\mathrm{for~~ } r\\le 2^{1/6}\\sigma \\\\          & = & 0",

    "we use the langevin dynamics with the equation of motion @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the monomer friction coefficient and @xmath67 , is a gaussian white noise with zero mean at a temperature t , and satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation relation : @xmath68    the purely repulsive wall consists of one monolayer of lj particles of diameter 1.5@xmath59 on a _ triangular lattice _ at the @xmath69 plane at @xmath70 .",
    "the pore is created by removing the particle at the center . inside the pore ,",
    "the polymer beads experience a constant force @xmath71 and a repulsive potential from the inside wall of the pore .",
    "the reduced units of length , time and temperature are chosen to be @xmath59 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "for the spring potential we have chosen @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the friction co - efficient @xmath76 , and the temperature is kept at @xmath77 throughout the simulation .",
    "we carried out simulations for chain lengths @xmath0 from @xmath78 for two choices of the biasing force @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "initially the first monomer of the chain is placed at the entry of the pore .",
    "keeping the first monomer in its original position the rest of the chain is then equilibrated for times at least an amount proportional to the @xmath81 . the chain is then allowed to move through the pore driven by the field present inside the pore .",
    "when the last monomer exits the pore we stop the simulation and note the translocation time and then repeat the same for @xmath82 such trials .",

    "the scaling exponent @xmath22 of the mean translocation time @xmath4 is extracted by plotting the @xmath1 as a function of @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ tau ] . evidently , we find that @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ tau ] shows that the velocity of the center of mass increases linearly with the bias and scales as @xmath97 .",
    "we note that @xmath98 does not scale as @xmath99 .",
    "it has been suggested that this exponent is not universal and depends on the width and the geometry of the pore@xcite .",
    "we will come back to this issue later .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath57 of the @xmath7 coordinate is shown in fig .",
    "[ anomal ] . for clarity ,",
    "we have shown results for the two largest chain lengths @xmath0 = 128 and 256 . when we calculate the first and the second moments of @xmath28 we find that @xmath100 and @xmath101 for a wide range of the translocation time ( the slope remains the same between the blue and the green vertical windows and between the green and the red vertical windows respectively in fig .",
    "the data as a function of the scaled translocation time @xmath102 show excellent collapse . since @xmath103",
    ", one expects to see @xmath104 during the same time window .",
    "however , @xmath105 reveals additional features where the slope changes from @xmath106 ( between blue and green dashed vertical lines ) to @xmath107 ( between green and red vertical lines ) . for the forced translocation @xmath108 and it is likely that a tiny difference of time dependence of the first and 2nd moment during the translocation of the chain that is not visible in the plot of 1st or the 2nd moment of the @xmath7-coordinate becomes noticeable in its fluctuation .",
    "therefore , if we use the fluctuations in @xmath7 to define @xmath109 , then from the late time slope ( fig .",
    "3 ) then we get @xmath110 .",
    "( top , dotted ) and @xmath111 ( top , dashed - dot ) , and @xmath112 ( bottom ) as a function of the scaled translocation time @xmath102 .",
    "the black and blue colors correspond to chain length n=128 for f=4.0 and f=6.0 respectively .",
    "the red and magenta colors correspond to the chain length n=256 for f=4.0 and f=6.0 respectively . ]",
    "we now compare these results with the theoretical predictions and other existing numerical results .",
    "the translocation exponent in 3d , according to kantor and kardar@xcite , is @xmath113 , and according to dubbledam@xcite is @xmath114 .",
    "first of all , as observed in @xmath43 mc simulations by kantor and kardar@xcite we also obtain a smaller value of @xmath115 in 3d .",
    "kantor and kardar argued that a lower value is obtained due to finite size effects and expect that for very large chains one would find @xmath116 .",
    "this bound has recently been criticized by vocks _ _ et al.__@xcite who using arguments about memory effects in the monomer dynamics came up with an alternate exponent estimate given by @xmath117 .",
    "evidently , our result is in agreement with this prediction . as for the exponent @xmath57",
    "we find @xmath118 , and @xmath119 ( if we use the later window ) .",
    "therefore , with dubbledam _",
    "_ we do not agree with the calculated value of @xmath22 , but dubbledam _ et al .",
    "_ also used @xmath120 , to define the exponent @xmath57 and the numerical value @xmath56 is exactly the same as found here .",
    "it is noteworthy that the fluctuation @xmath121 is time dependent and the slope of @xmath122 at early time crosses over to @xmath123 at a later time , while the slope for @xmath101 is constant for a wider range .",
    "if we use @xmath124 , obtained from the definition of fluctuation of the @xmath7 coordinate , then we find the relation @xmath44 is satisfied for the forced translocation as well .",
    "this trend is qualitatively the same for the simulation using a square pore@xcite , where we find that @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 ( so that @xmath128 , same as reported here if we extract @xmath57 from the slope of the plot @xmath129 ) .",
    "our results may be relevant in the context of a recent recent article by chatelain , kantor , and kardar@xcite who showed that the variance of the probability distribution @xmath130 grows subdiffusievly .",
    "we now look more closely at the factors responsible for the translocation process .",
    "the expression @xmath131 has two components : the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath0 and @xmath132 on @xmath0 respectively .",
    "we now look at these two components separately . during the driven translocation",
    "the chain does not find enough time to relax .",
    "therefore , it is important to know how does the shape of the chain vary as a function of time and how different it is compared to its equilibrium configuration . during the forced translocation at any instant of time only one segment of the entire chain",
    "feels the bias .",
    "kantor and kardar@xcite argued that the shape of the chain is hardly affected by it so that it will still be described by the equilibrium flory exponent @xmath16 .",
    "this argument will not be strictly valid for the model used here as the beads are connected by elastic bonds and it is expected that quite a few neighbors on either side of the driven bead inside the pore will be indirectly affected by it .    in order to verify this issue first , we have calculated the equilibrium @xmath133 of the chain clamped at one end at the pore in presence of the same lj wall .",
    "we find @xmath134 ( fig .  [ rgvz ] ) .",
    "we have also calculated the relaxation time @xmath135 of the end - to - end vector @xmath136 and checked that we get the same @xmath16 from the relaxation measurements .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical prediction of eisenriegler , kremer , and binder that in presence of the wall the exponent @xmath16 remains the same as that of its bulk counterpart @xcite . to get an idea how fast is the translocation process , compared to the corresponding relaxation time , for the chain lengths @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , we find @xmath139 , and @xmath140 respectively and the corresponding average translocation times @xmath1 are @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , respectively . even in the linear response regime",
    "where @xmath143 , we observe @xmath144 .",
    "the insets of fig .",
    "[ rgvz ] shows the time dependence of @xmath145 ( we use a different notation @xmath146 for the driven chain ) .",
    "we notice that during the translocation process the chain is significantly elongated around @xmath147 and acquires relatively compact structure immediately upon exiting the pore . the dashed lines ( black and green ) show the corresponding average values @xmath148 from which we extract the exponent @xmath149 ( fig .",
    "[ rgvz ] ) .     and",
    "effective @xmath146 during the translocation process .",
    "the absolute value of the effective @xmath146 is larger than the equilibrium value as it is pulled , but both of them scale with the equilibrium flory exponent .",
    "the insets shows the average time dependence of the @xmath150 and @xmath151 during the translocation .",
    "the straight lines in the inset represent the average value . ]",
    "contrary to what is assumed by kantor and kardar , we notice significant distortion of the chain .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the @xmath146 scales almost the same way as @xmath152 ( slopes are the same in fig .",
    "even when @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , numerically we find that the chain is still described by the equilibrium @xmath154 .    likewise ,",
    "as expected in ld simulation , we notice that @xmath150 saturates quite quickly and this value is almost the same during the translocation process and @xmath155 . where @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath156 , our studies indicate that it is the @xmath157 which does not exhibit inverse linear dependence on chain length @xmath0 is the responsible factor for the deviation from @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we have carried out exactly the same ld simulations with wall particles on a square lattice@xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath158 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 ( so that @xmath128 , same as reported here if we extract @xmath57 from the slope of the plot @xmath129 ) .",
    "these results for the square pore are also consistent with recently reported ld and md simulation results in 3d using gromacs@xcite .",
    "recently gauthier _ _ et al.__@xcite carried out similar studies of polymer translocation through a narrow pore ( including hydrodynamic interactions ) and found a systematic variation of the measured scaling exponents as a function of the pore width .",
    "however , their studies are limited to relatively narrow range of @xmath0 up to 31 only . in our studies the exponents for a relatively wide range of @xmath0 seem to depend on the pore geometry .",
    "whether this implies true nonuniversality or not remains an open issue .",
    "to summarize , we have used langevin dynamics in 3d to study the scaling properties of a driven translocating chain through a nanopore .",
    "we notice that the chain undergoes a significant shape change during the fast translocation process , contrary to what assumed by kantor and kardar is formulating the theory of forced translocation . however , despite significant distortion , we find the chain is still described by the equilibrium flory exponent .",
    "we find that the @xmath159 does not scale as its bulk counterpart and depends on pore width and geometry .",
    "it is likely that density variation on either side of the pore during the translocation process affects the overall motion of the chain .",
    "we find that the @xmath160 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the collective numerical work by various groups failed to validate the kantor and kardar result @xmath161 for the forced translocation , including the results listed here . likewise , although the value of @xmath162 that we obtain is in excellent agreement with the analytical estimate of vocks _ et al . _",
    "@xmath163 in 3d , the results from 2d simulations do not agree with the estimate of vocks _ et al._. finally , we notice a difference in the @xmath7-exponent @xmath57 when calculated from its second moment ( @xmath56 ) and its fluctuations ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "the later ( @xmath164 ) agrees with @xmath165 while @xmath56 overestimates it ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath167 seem to reveal more structures not adequately studied so far .",
    "when we compare these results with the existing theories and other numerical results we notice that these results only partially support one theory or the other . certainly more numerical and analytic work",
    "are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of forced translocation through nanopore .",
