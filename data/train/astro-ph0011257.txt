    "clusters of galaxies are thought to have released a large amount of dynamical energy in their initial collapse phase . during their subsequent evolution , starburst - driven winds , cluster mergers , radio galaxies , and random galaxy motions may have supplied additional heating energy to the intracluster space .",
    "presumably , these processes have generated energetic particles ( e.g. @xcite ) , as evidenced by diffuse synchrotron radio emission from some clusters .",
    "such energetic particles are expected to produce nonthermal x - rays as well , by compton - boosting cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "long searches for such effects among galaxy clusters have recently revealed two candidates ; the excess soft x - ray emission detected with _ euve _",
    "@xcite , and the spectral hard x - ray tail observed with",
    "however , the exact nature of these emission components remain unclear .",
    "groups of galaxies are the poorest class of galaxy clusters .",
    "their thermal emission is limited to energies below @xmath7 kev , because the temperature of their hot intragroup medium is about 1 kev ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , they allow us to search for nonthermal x - ray emission , even with instruments operating below an energy of @xmath8 kev . here",
    "we report the detection of excess hard x - ray emission from the group of galaxies hcg62 with the _ asca _ gis @xcite .",
    "we employ 90% confidence limits throughout this paper , and use the hubble constant of 50 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "solar abundances refer to @xcite .",
    "with a redshift of 0.0137 @xcite , hcg62 is one of the nearest hickson compact galaxy groups .",
    "it was observed twice with _ asca _ ; on 1994 january 1415 in a single pointing , and on 1998 january 1317 in 4 pointings to cover the whole group region .",
    "the gis was operated in ph mode , and the sis in 2ccd faint mode in 1994 .",
    "we do not use the sis data taken in 1998 , because of the insufficient field of view of 1 ccd mode employed at that time .",
    "after an appropriate gain correction , we co - added all the available data from different sensors , chips , and pointings , separately for the gis and the sis .",
    "the livetime is @xmath9 ksec for the 1994 observation , and @xmath10 ksec for each of the 4 pointings of the 1998 observation .",
    "the total gis livetime thus amounts to 110 ksec .    for our purpose , it is important to accurately subtract the gis background , which consists of cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) and intrinsic detector background ( idb ) .",
    "we first summed data of the _ asca _ large sky survey @xcite , conducted in 1993 december and 1994 june over blank sky fields , with a total exposure time of 233 ksec .",
    "then , after @xcite , we excluded regions in the gis images where count rate exceeds those from surrounding regions by @xmath112.5@xmath12 .",
    "this eliminates faint sources with the 210 kev flux @xmath13 erg s@xmath5 @xmath4 .",
    "we next corrected the idb level of each pointing individually for its gradual increase by 23% per year , and for its random day - by - day fluctuation by 68% @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , we derived three gis spectra , denoted @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , from the on - source data , the blank sky data prepared as above , and night earth data , respectively .",
    "they were accumulated over an annulus of radius @xmath17 from the gis field center and in the 610 kev energy range , to ensure that @xmath14 is free from the hcg62 emission , and that the cxb is relatively minor compared to the idb in @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "then , assuming that the idb spectrum and its radial profile are both constant , we fitted @xmath14 with a linear combination @xmath18 ; here @xmath19 is a free parameter , and @xmath20 represents the secular idb change between the two epochs when @xmath14 and @xmath15 were acquired .",
    "we have obtained @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the 1994 data and those of 1998 , respectively , in agreement with the idb long - term increase @xcite . by analyzing various _",
    "data , we also confirmed that this method can reproduce , to within 5% , the gis background spectra and its radial profiles acquired at any epoch over 19931999 .",
    "the sis has a lower efficiency in the hard x - ray band , a shorter exposure time , and a smaller field of view , than the gis .",
    "we therefore utilize the sis spectrum only to determine the soft thermal emission from the intragroup medium .",
    "we subtract the sis background in a conventional way , utilizing the archival sis background set .",
    "to avoid the diffuse thermal emission with a typical plasma temperature of @xmath23 kev @xcite , we produced the gis image of hcg62 in the hard 4.58 kev band , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "there , we overlaid the 1.02.4 kev image as a measure of the thermal emission , of which the brightness peak coincides in position with the group center to within @xmath24 .",
    "the image reveals a hard x - ray emission , which apparently extends up to @xmath1 from the group center .",
    "figure 2 shows the radial gis count - rate profile in the energy band of 4.58 kev , centered on the soft x - ray brightness peak .",
    "also shown are the instrumental point - spread function ( psf ) , and the profile of the estimated background .",
    "thus , the background level is well reproduced at larger radii within 5% , and the hard x - ray emission is more extended than the psf , detectable up to @xmath25 from the group center . as shown in the inset to figure 2 , the hard x - ray surface brightness is higher in the north region than in the south region . such a feature",
    "can not be explained as a spill - over from the 1 kev thermal emission .",
    "the hard x - ray brightness is not correlated with the galaxy distribution , either , including emission line galaxies @xcite .",
    "the observed hard x - ray emission , though apparently extended , could simply be a result of several hard point sources , such as active galaxies , either related or unrelated to hcg62 . to answer this issue",
    ", we examined the archival _ rosat _ image of hcg62 , and found four point sources with 0.12 kev fluxes of @xmath26 erg s@xmath5 @xmath4 ( shown in figure 1 as open squares ) at the locations where the hard - band gis image actually exhibits possible enhancements with the implied 210 kev fluxes of @xmath27 erg s@xmath5 @xmath4 . the flux ratio between _ asca _ and _ rosat _ indicates that the source spectra have a power - law shape of photon index @xmath28 .",
    "we have accordingly excluded photons falling within @xmath29 of these four sources . in addition , in order to remove possible point - like sources at the central region of hcg62 , we excluded photons within @xmath30 of the group center . then , the 4.58 kev gis2+gis3 flux from the on - source data has become @xmath31 photons over the radius of @xmath32 , compared to @xmath33 expected from the background count rate .",
    "the excess , @xmath34 counts , well exceeds the @xmath3560 counts expected for the 1 kev thermal emission .",
    "thus , the presence of the extended excess hard x - ray emission is significant from the gis imagery even after excluding possible point - source contamination .    in order to examine the excess hard x - ray emission through spectroscopy , we have produced spectra over the radius of @xmath32 , by utilizing all the available data from the gis and only the first pointing data from the sis .",
    "the regions within 2.5@xmath36 of the four point - like sources were again excluded .",
    "we discarded the sis data above 4 kev for the reason described before .",
    "the obtained spectra are presented in figure 3 .",
    "we fitted them simultaneously , by a single temperature plasma emission model @xcite ( r - s model ) with solar abundance ratios @xcite , modified by photoelectric absorption .",
    "as shown in table 1 and figure 3 , the model successfully reproduced the data in lower energies , and the derived temperature and metallicity are consistent with those of @xcite .",
    "however , the model is not acceptable due to significant residuals seen in the gis fit over energies of @xmath37 kev .",
    "when we limit the energy band to @xmath38 kev , the fit becomes acceptable with a reduced chi square of 1.29 and the best - fit temperature of @xmath39 kev .",
    "in contrast , when we use only the hard energy band above 2 kev , the best - fit temperature increases to @xmath40 kev ; this is inconsistent with that indicated by the soft - band data , and is much higher than the prediction from the galaxy velocity dispersion of @xmath41 km s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these results reconfirm the presence of excess hard x - ray emission above the prediction of the thermal emission of temperature @xmath42 kev .",
    "the results of @xcite , who reported a high temperature of @xmath43 kev around @xmath44 of the group center , are also consistent with ours .",
    "we refitted the whole - band spectra by adding a bremsstrahlung or a power - law component , to represent the excess hard x - ray emission .",
    "as summarized in table 1 , either modeling has given an acceptable joint fit to the _ asca _ spectra .",
    "the bremsstrahlung temperature has been constrained as @xmath2 kev , while the power - law photon index @xmath45 was found at @xmath46 .",
    "although @xmath45 can be as high as 2.7 , such a steep power - law forces the r - s component to have an extremely high metallicity .",
    "when we fix the metallicity of the r - s component at 0.30 solar which is typically found from clusters of galaxies , the upper limit on @xmath45 becomes 2.2 .",
    "below , we utilize this limit instead of the original one .",
    "the normalization of the hard component does not change by more than 20% , if we use plasma emission codes other than the r - s code .",
    "the upper limit on narrow fe - k line features at @xmath47 kev is uninteresting , several kev in equivalent width .",
    "the absorption column density can not be constrained in any case , and consistent with the galactic value of @xmath48@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the 210 kev x - ray flux and luminosity of the hard x - ray component are @xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 and @xmath6 erg s@xmath5 , respectively , regardless of the choice between the two modelings .",
    "this amounts to about 20% of the 0.510 kev thermal - component luminosity of @xmath49 erg s@xmath5 ( fukazawa 1997 ) .",
    "although we have carefully estimated the background , it is still important to examine to what extent our results are affected by possible background uncertainties . to see this , we intentionally increased the idb background level by 5% , and found that the 210 kev flux and luminosity of the hard component becomes @xmath50 erg s@xmath5 @xmath4 and @xmath51 erg s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "thus , the hard emission remains statistically significant .",
    "from the galaxy group hcg62 , we have detected the excess x - ray emission with a very hard spectrum , which extends up to more than 10@xmath36 from the group center and somewhat enhanced at the north region .",
    "although its surface brightness is only @xmath3520% of that of the gis background , we have confirmed its reality through careful analysis .",
    "below , we discuss the origin and nature of this phenomenon .",
    "an immediate possibility is collection of binary x - ray sources in the member galaxies of hcg62 .",
    "however , based on the total optical luminosity of hcg62 ( @xmath52 ; @xcite ) and the optical vs. x - ray luminosity correlation among elliptical galaxies @xcite , this contribution is estimated to be at most @xmath53 erg s@xmath5 , which is an order of magnitude short of the observed luminosity .",
    "a second possibility is assembly of faint active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in hcg62 .",
    "however , the optical evidence for agns in hcg62 is moderate @xcite , and we have already subtracted such candidates based on the _ rosat _ image .",
    "any remaining agns are estimated to contribute no more than 3040% of the total hard x - ray emission .",
    "yet another possibility is fluctuation of background faint sources . utilizing the log@xmath54log@xmath55 relation in the 210 kev band @xcite , this contribution",
    "is estimated to be at most @xmath56 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 over the radius of @xmath32 , which is again too low to explain the data . from these considerations , we conclude that the excess hard x - ray emission can not be explained by assembly of discrete hard x - ray sources , whatever their nature be .",
    "considering the loose constraint on the fe - k line , the excess emission might be of thermal origin from very hot plasmas .",
    "actually , @xcite described the _",
    "spectra of hcg62 , integrated over a radius of @xmath57@xmath30 , by a two - temperature plasma model of @xmath58 and @xmath59 kev .",
    "we have independently reconfirmed their results .",
    "however , our spectra ( figure 3 ) that are accumulated over the @xmath30@xmath60 range requires a temperature of @xmath61 kev ; the original two - temperature model found by @xcite gives a very poor fit ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "thus , thermal emission with an `` ordinary '' temperature can not explain the data .",
    "insignificant detection of excess hard x - rays over a radius of @xmath57@xmath30 might be due to poor photon statistics and complex spectra of thermal components @xcite at the center region , spectral change of hard components , and so on .",
    "there might still be plasmas much hotter than the escape temperature , as is actually found in starburst galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , within @xmath60 of hcg62 , there is no bright iras sources with the 60 @xmath63 m flux exceeding 2 jy ( skyview at high energy astrophysics science archive research center ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the thermal interpretation of the excess hard x - ray emission is unrealistic .",
    "given the difficulties with the discrete - source and thermal interpretations of the diffuse hard x - ray emission , we regard nonthermal interpretation as most promising . one popular scenario of non - thermal x - ray production is inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons by relativistic electrons with lorentz factor @xmath64 , as has been invoked to explain the excess hard x - ray emission from rich clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , we can not constrain the intragroup magnetic field in hcg62 due to lack of information on the diffuse radio flux . if we assume a representative magnetic field intensity of 1 @xmath63 g",
    ", we would observe synchrotron radio emission with a flux density of @xmath350.3 jy .",
    "since such a strong radio emission is not seen from hcg62 ( skyview ; nvss vla image ) , the inverse - compton interpretation holds for hcg62 only if its magnetic field is much weaker than 1 @xmath63 g .",
    "the reality of such a weak magnetic field is an open question , and in an apparent contradiction to the generally accepted inter - galactic field strengths of @xmath65 g @xcite , even though such a condition is suggested by the _ bepposax _ and _ rxte _ observations of some rich clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation is nonthermal bremsstrahlung between the thermal gas and subrelativistic particles , as proposed for the hard x - ray emission from abell  2199 , of which diffuse radio flux is quite weak @xcite like in the case of hcg62 . let us assume for simplicity that the nonthermal electrons have typical energies of 10100 kev , and their spatial density distribution is similar to that of the thermal intragroup gas .",
    "then , the nonthermal to thermal luminosity ratio in the 0.510 kev band becomes @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the density ratio of the nonthermal electrons to the thermal ones .",
    "the observed luminosity ratio of @xmath68 implies @xmath690.06 , indicating that the energy density of nonthermal electrons is 0.66 times as high as that of thermal electrons ( depending on the spectrum ) .",
    "if this is the case , the mechanism of such particle acceleration becomes an important issue .",
    "in addition , the non - thermal pressure associated with such a particle population would considerably increase the total mass of hcg62 , and hence its dark - matter content , estimated from the x - ray data .",
    "the diffuse hard x - ray emission has been observed with _ asca _ from some other galaxy groups",
    "as well @xcite .",
    "however , its prominence relative to the thermal x - ray emission appears to scatter from object to object like rich clusters @xcite , with hcg62 one of the strongest case .",
    "although it is yet to be studied what makes such variety , the hard x - ray emission might be related with transient phenomena such as mergers .",
