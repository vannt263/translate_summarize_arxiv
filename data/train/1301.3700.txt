    "the paper introduces a product construction of legendrian submanifolds in contact manifolds of the form @xmath0 .",
    "it gives a multitude of examples of interesting legendrian submanifolds in a wide array of contact manifolds , not simply affine space and jet spaces , and generalizes some previous constructions .",
    "this construction also seems useful for technical reasons and allows the construction of relative invariants of legendrian knots and further study of spaces of legendrian knots .",
    "we also compute the thurston - bennequin invariant and maslov class for these product legendrians in terms of geometric and topological properties of the factors and obtain an explicit formula when the ambient contact manifold is @xmath3 .",
    "this calculation demonstrates that the legendrian isotopy class of the product is determined by the particular embedding of a legendrian factor and not its isotopy class .",
    "it shows that the contact geometry of these spaces is extremely rich .    the motivation for this paper is exploring the contact geometry of manifolds @xmath0 , where @xmath4 is an exact symplectic manifold , by constructing many examples of legendrian submanifolds .",
    "the legendrian submanifolds of @xmath5 , legendrian knots , are well - explored and have found importance in low - dimensional topology .",
    "however , much less is known about higher dimensional ( @xmath6 ) contact manifolds and their legendrian submanifolds .",
    "several authors have built examples , including the frontspinning construction of ekholm , etnyre and sullivan @xcite , a generalization to spheres of arbitrary dimensions by golovko @xcite , hypercube tori defined by baldridge and mccarty @xcite and tori given as the trace of legendrian isotopies by ekholm and kalman @xcite .",
    "in fact , the former three construction should naturally be understood as products in the sense of this paper .    as smooth knotting is a codimension 2 phenomenom , legendrian submanifolds in higher dimensions",
    "lose some of their relevance to smooth topology of their ambient spaces .",
    "yet there are indications that the contact geometry of these spaces is rich with legendrian submanifolds and this paper gives more evidence for this suspicion .",
    "for instance , knot contact homology is an invariant of smooth knots in @xmath5 , defined by lenhard ng , that assigns to each knot a legendrian torus in @xmath7 .",
    "legendrian contact homology is a legendrian invariant of the torus and is therefore a smooth invariant of the underlying knot . as of this writing , there are currently no known examples of two inequivalent smooth knots with isomorphic knot contact homology .",
    "the construction of legendrian products is straightforward . for a detailed explanation of the terminology , see section [ sec : prelim ] .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be contact manifolds such that @xmath10 are exact symplectic manifolds and with contact forms @xmath11 , @xmath12 , respectivly .",
    "take legendrian submanifolds @xmath13 and @xmath14 with reeb chords @xmath15 and let @xmath16 denote their lagrangian projections in @xmath17",
    ". then @xmath18 is an exact lagrangian submanifold of @xmath19 .",
    "[ def : legprod ] the _ legendrian product _ @xmath2 is the legendrian submanifold in @xmath20 given by the lift of @xmath18 .",
    "it is an immersed legendrian submanifold and is embedded if the sets of reeb chord actions @xmath21 are disjoint .",
    "* caution*. this construction is _ not _ well - defined up to legendrian isotopy of one of the factors . if @xmath22 is a continuous , one - paramter family of embedded legendrians in @xmath0 , it is not true that @xmath23 gives a legendrian isotopy through embeddings .",
    "legendrian isotopies can introduce or annihilate reeb chords and change reeb chord actions , which may introduce self - intersections of @xmath23 for some @xmath24 .",
    "thus the product construction depends upon the explicit embeddings @xmath25 and @xmath26 and not simply on the legendrian isotopy class of @xmath27 or @xmath28 .    in fact , by varying the legendrian embedding of a factor within its legendrian isotopy class ,",
    "one can obtain infinitely many , non - legendrian isotopic products .",
    "[ thrm : infty ] let @xmath29 be chord generic legendrians such that @xmath30 have different parity",
    ". then there exists an infinite family of legendrians @xmath31 all legendrian isotopic to @xmath27 such that the family of legendrian products @xmath32 are pairwise non - legendrian isotopic .    to prove this",
    ", we calculate the thurston - bennequin invariant of these legendrian products in terms of the embeddings of @xmath1 .",
    "there are two well - known , classical invariants of legendrian knots : the thurston - bennequin number and the rotation number .",
    "these have been generalized to higher dimensions by tabachnikov and by ekholm , etnyre and sullivan .",
    "the latter described the thurston - bennequin invariant for homologically - trivial legendrians @xmath28 as the linking number of @xmath28 with a pushoff @xmath33 of itself along the reeb vector field @xmath34 in our setting , when the ambient contact manifold is @xmath0 , this can be computed in a manner similar to the writhe of knots .",
    "the maslov class is a cohomology class @xmath35 that assigns to each 1-dimensional homology class the maslov index of a path representing that class . in dimension 3 ,",
    "the rotation number is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a generator of @xmath38 .",
    "suppose that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are chord generic legendrians with reeb chords @xmath15 .",
    "then we can obtain the following formula for the classical invariants of their product .",
    "[ thrm : tb ] the thurston - bennequin number of @xmath2 is given by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 the maslov class of @xmath2 is given by @xmath43    the last term in the @xmath44 formula requires some elaboration .",
    "locally , each transverse double point is the intersection of two open @xmath45-disks in a single point .",
    "just as computing the sign of a knot crossing requires knowing which strand passes over the other , computing the sign of a reeb chord requires knowing which disk passes `` over '' the other . in the product @xmath2 , after a suitable perturbation , there is a reeb chord @xmath46 for each pair @xmath47 of reeb chords of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "however , determining which disk is `` over '' and which is `` under '' depends upon the relative lengths of the reeb chords @xmath48 .      using this product construction , it is also possible to build examples of legendrian submanifolds in closed contact manifolds .",
    "let @xmath49 be a contact manifold , @xmath50 a legendrian submanifold , @xmath51 a contact embedding of codimension @xmath52 with trivial conformal symplectic normal bundle and @xmath53 a legendrian submanifold .",
    "then we can identify a neighborhood of @xmath28 with a neighborhood of the 0-section in @xmath54 and find @xmath55 as a legendrian submanifold of @xmath56 , which we denote by @xmath57 and refer to as the _ spinning _ of @xmath27 by @xmath28 .",
    "it is clear from the construction that this is invariant under legendrian isotopies of @xmath28 in @xmath49 , contact isotopies of @xmath49 in @xmath56 and compactly supported isotopies of @xmath27 .    in @xcite , etnyre , ekholm and sullivan",
    "defined a construction , called frontspinning , which takes a legendrian @xmath58 and produces a legendrian @xmath59 of topological type @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , these should more naturally be seen as the product of @xmath28 with a standard legendrian unknot with @xmath61 .",
    "consider @xmath62 as the unit sphere in @xmath63 and take the obvious contact embedding @xmath64 .",
    "we prove the following theorem and corollary .",
    "[ thrm : spin ] let @xmath28 be a legendrian submanifold of @xmath62 ( equiv @xmath65 ) and @xmath27 a legendrian submanifold of @xmath66 , chosen so that all reeb chord actions of @xmath27 are much less than all reeb chord actions of @xmath28",
    ". then @xmath67 and @xmath2 are legendrian isotopic in @xmath3    let @xmath68 denote the whitney embedding of the standard legendrian unknot of @xmath69 with exactly one reeb chord of length 1 .",
    "[ cor : front ] let @xmath58 be legendrian all of whose reeb chords have action @xmath70 . then @xmath71 and @xmath72 are legendrian isotopic in @xmath3 .",
    "golovko has recently @xcite extended the frontspinning construction to produce legendrians in @xmath73 of topological type @xmath74 and this can be interpreted as products with whitney spheres of arbitrary dimension .",
    "the thurston - bennequin invariant is sometimes blind , as in @xcite it is shown to reduce to the euler characteristic when the ambient manifold is @xmath3 for even @xmath45 .",
    "so the thurston - bennequin invariant is not useful for distinguishing products when the dimensions of the factors have the same parity .",
    "the results here suggest that a more powerful invariant , such as legendrian contact homology , will reveal many interesting examples of legendrian submanifolds in higher dimensional contact manifolds .",
    "legendrian contact homology is an invariant of legendrian submanifolds that fits into the general framework of symplectic field theory .",
    "it has been constructed by ekholm , etnyre and sullivan when the ambient contact manifold is some @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite . to each legendrian @xmath28 , it associates a diferential graded algebra , which is invariant up to an appropriate algebraic equivalence .",
    "the algebra is the unital tensor algebra over the group ring @xmath75 $ ] generated by the reeb chords of @xmath28 .",
    "the differential counts rigid , punctured holomorphic maps @xmath76 with a single positive puncture and arbitrarily many negative punctures . in dimension 3",
    ", the legendrian contact homology of legendrian knots is known as the chekanov - eliashberg dga and by the riemann mapping theorem , can be computed combinatorially from either the front or lagrangian projection of a knot .",
    "the legendrian contact homology of the product @xmath55 can be computed in terms of geometric and topological data of the factors ( see @xcite ) .",
    "holomorphic disks on the product @xmath55 are determined by and can be constructed from holomorphic disks and gradient flow lines on the factors .",
    "however , an interesting complication arises from the dependence on relative reeb chord lengths that first appeared in the thurston - bennequin calculation .",
    "specifically , the lch of the product potentially includes information determined by holomorphic disks with multiple positive punctures .",
    "this information is ignored in the standard version of legendrian contact homology .",
    "this suggests that a full understanding of the lch of products is more interesting than one might expect from the construction and from results of ekholm , etnyre and sabloff on the linearized contact homology of frontspun legendrians @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "given that the lch of legendrian knots can be computed combinatorially and that ekholm has established a correspondence between rigid holomorphic disks on @xmath77 and rigid gradient flow trees on @xmath28 , it is reasonable to conjecture the following :    the legendrian contact homology of the products of legendrian knots can be computed combinatorially .",
    "finally , for @xmath78 and @xmath53 suitably small , theorem [ thrm : spin ] shows that the product @xmath55 is well - defined up to legendrian isotopy of the factors .",
    "thus , the legendrian contact homology of the product @xmath55 is a legendrian invariant of both of the factors .",
    "yet since it depends upon geometric data not included in the lch of the factors , this invariant may provide more information about the legendrian isotopy class of @xmath28 and @xmath27 than the lch of the factors individually .",
    "( relative legendrian invariants ) is lch(@xmath55 ) a stronger invariant of @xmath28 than @xmath79 for some @xmath27 ?",
    "in particular , one may fix @xmath28 and vary @xmath27 , using the lch of the product to probe the contact geometry of @xmath28 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : prelim ] reviews some preliminary content and definitions about contact geometry , legendrians , reeb chords in the relevant setting of manifolds of the form @xmath0 .",
    "section [ sec : tb ] contains the proofs of theorems [ thrm : tb ] and [ thrm : infty ] .",
    "this first requires constructing a suitable perturbation of the conormal lift as it is not chord generic .",

    "however , @xmath283 and @xmath284 have the same sign since the pairs @xmath285 and @xmath286 are distinct .",
    "moreover , we can add aribtrarily many pairs of reeb chord pairs @xmath287 so that @xmath288 and @xmath289 for all @xmath290 .",
    "thus , we can add @xmath291 to the thurston - bennequin invariant for arbitrary nonnegative integer @xmath45 .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove theorem [ thrm : spin ] and corollary [ cor : front ] .",
    "we first define frontspinning as in @xcite , then give an alternate , invariant description of this construction called spinning before proving that spinning and the legendrian product are equivalent in @xmath3 .",
    "frontspinning is a construction defined by ekholm , etnyre and sullivan that takes a legendrian @xmath78 and produces a legendrian @xmath292 of topological type @xmath60 .",
    "suppose that a legendrian @xmath78 is given by the embedding @xmath293 and parametrized such that @xmath294 let @xmath295 be the projection onto the @xmath205 and @xmath89 coordinates .",
    "the _ front projection _ of @xmath28 is the subsvariety @xmath296 if @xmath297 is a subvariety of @xmath298 such that @xmath299 for any @xmath300 , then @xmath297 lifts to an isotropic subvariety of @xmath3 as the @xmath301-coordinates can be chosen at each point to satisfy the contact condition .",
    "the _ frontspinning _ of @xmath28 is the lift to @xmath302 of the following subvariety of @xmath303 : @xmath304 for @xmath305 $ ] .",
    "this can be thought of as spinning the front projection of @xmath28 around the plane @xmath306 in @xmath303 and the intersections of @xmath297 with the planes @xmath307 give a family of front projections of @xmath28 as @xmath308 varies .",
    "we now give an alternate interpretation of this construction that generalizes to arbitrary contact manifolds .",
    "choose some legendrian @xmath309 , a contact embedding @xmath51 of codimension @xmath52 with trivial @xmath138 and a legendrian @xmath310 . by scaling and translation",
    ", we can assume that @xmath28 lies in a suitably small neighborhood of the origin .",
    "it follows that the conformal symplectic normal bundle of @xmath27 in @xmath56 splits as @xmath311 and by assumption , since @xmath27 is legendrian , this bundle is trivial of rank @xmath52 .",
    "the _ spinning _ of @xmath28 by @xmath27 , denoted @xmath57 , is the legendrian submanifold of @xmath56 obtained as the image of @xmath2 under the contactomorphism that identifies neighborhoods of @xmath27 in @xmath312 and @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear from the construction that ambient contact isotopies of @xmath313 and @xmath28 extend to legendrian isotopies of @xmath57 , provided that @xmath28 is contained in a suitably small neighborhood of 0 .    consider @xmath314 as the unit sphere in @xmath315 .",
    "then for the embedding @xmath316 , the conformal symplectic normal bundle @xmath317 is trivial .",
    "let @xmath68 be the submanifold @xmath318 it is easy to verify that w is legendrian and isotopic to the standard legendrian unknot with @xmath61 .",
    "[ lemma : sigmal ] the legendrian submanifolds @xmath71 and @xmath319 are identical .    let @xmath132 be the standard complex structure on @xmath320 .",
    "then we can trivialize @xmath321 as @xmath322 @xmath323 and trivialize @xmath324 as @xmath325 the reeb vector field in @xmath69 along @xmath68 is given by @xmath326 .",
    "it follows from above that the frontspun @xmath71 is obtained by restricting to @xmath28 in each fiber of the bundle @xmath327    we can now prove theorem [ thrm : spin ]    choose a darboux ball around the point @xmath328 , given by some map @xmath329 of the unit ball , that restricts to a darboux ball @xmath330 on @xmath62 as well .",
    "thus , @xmath331 is exactly @xmath332 .",
    "choose some legendrian isotopy @xmath22 in @xmath62 so that @xmath333 and @xmath334 in this darboux ball on @xmath62 .",
    "the isotopy extends to some suitable neighborhood of @xmath27 and isotope @xmath28 so that @xmath67 lies in this neighborhood .",
    "the legendrian isotopy of @xmath27 thus extends to a legendrian isotopy from @xmath67 to @xmath331 .",
    "recall that the contact disk theorem states that for any two contact embeddings @xmath335 of the unit ball into a contact manifold , there is a contact isotopy @xmath336 such that @xmath337 .",
    "thus , there exists some isotopy @xmath338 such that @xmath339 and this isotopy sends @xmath331 to @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath28 must live in a suitably small neighborhood of the origin , whose diameter must be less than the length of the reeb chords of @xmath27 , it follows that all its reeb chord actions must be less than this diameter .",
    "corollary [ cor : front ] now follows directly from lemma [ lemma : sigmal ] and theorem [ thrm : spin ] .",
    "a whitney sphere @xmath340 is the legendrian sphere @xmath341 given as the lift of the following exact lagrangian immersion in @xmath342 : @xmath343 where @xmath105 is some positive real constant .",
    "this immersion has exactly 1 transverse double point at @xmath344 and so the legendrian @xmath340 has exactly one reeb chord , of length determined by @xmath105 .",
    "consider the product @xmath345 of a single 1-sphere and a single 2-sphere .",
    "since the parities of the dimensions are different , the dimension of the product is odd and the thurston - bennequin invariant will be useful .",
    "we have @xmath346 denote the reeb chords @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",
    "the @xmath349 factor for this pair is @xmath350 thus @xmath351 now , consider the product @xmath352 of a single 1-sphere and a single 4-sphere .",
    "we have @xmath353 the @xmath349 factor for this pair is @xmath354 thus @xmath355      let @xmath357 be three whitney unknots . to calculate the thurston - bennequin invariant of @xmath358",
    "apply theorem [ thrm : tb ] twice .",
    "the torus @xmath359 has @xmath360 and @xmath361 and , after perturbing , has six reeb chords with actions @xmath362 @xmath363 @xmath364 @xmath365 and signs @xmath366 @xmath367 where @xmath368 is a unique morse critical point of index @xmath369 . since @xmath370 the only potential nonzero term in theorem [ thrm : tb ] is the @xmath349-term when computing @xmath44 for the triple product .",
    "note that for the a chords , @xmath371 , so that @xmath372 since the signs of the morse critical points @xmath373 cancel .",
    "similarly , the @xmath349 terms involving the b chords cancel .",
    "now , @xmath374",
    "@xmath375 since @xmath376 and @xmath377 .",
    "thus , @xmath378 in other words , @xmath379 if @xmath380 satisfy the triangle inequality and @xmath360 otherwise .",
    "the product of two legendrian knots is a torus , whose euler characteristic and thurston - bennequin invariant are 0 .",
    "however , there are interesting @xmath44 calculations for products of three legendrian knots .",
    "let @xmath381 be a collection of three legendrian knots with reeb chords @xmath382 .",
    "define @xmath383 then the arguments in example 5.2 can be repeated for each triple of reeb chords @xmath380 and the thurston - bennequin invariant is @xmath384 take @xmath385 to be a once - stabilized unknot , @xmath386 a standard unknot after applying a reidemeister-1 move , and @xmath387 a right - handed trefoil .",
    "these can be chosen to have the front projections and lagrangian projections depicted in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath385 has two reeb chords @xmath398 ; @xmath386 has three reeb chords @xmath399 ; and @xmath387 has five reeb chords @xmath400 . by abuse of notation , @xmath401 will refer to both the chord and its action .",
    "these chords have signs @xmath402 so @xmath403 , @xmath404 and @xmath405 .",
    "the reeb chord actions can not be chosen completely arbitrarily as each face of the knot diagram in the lagrangian projection must satisfy the area identity determined by stokes s theorem . for a face @xmath406 of @xmath27 ,",
    "the boundary @xmath407 lies in @xmath408 and the double points of the knot projection split the boundary into segments @xmath409 , indexed counter - clockwise .",
    "a corner of the face is _ positive _ if near the reeb chord , the @xmath89-coordinate of @xmath410 is greater than the @xmath89-coordinate of @xmath411 and _ negative _ otherwise .",
    "( area identity ) let @xmath412 be a face of the knot diagram in the lagrangian projection and @xmath413 be its boundary . then @xmath414 where @xmath415 are the reeb chords corresponding to the positive and negative corners of @xmath412    since each face of a knot diagram must have positive area , it follows that @xmath416 and that this is the only restriction on the actions . with this in mind and without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath417 refer to some chord in the sets @xmath418 , respectively .",
    "the minimum @xmath44 is achieved if all triples @xmath419 satisfy the triangle inequality and none of the triples @xmath420 satisfy it , since @xmath421 and @xmath422 .",
