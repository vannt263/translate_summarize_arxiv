    "many complex processes occurring in nature are believed to be organized in a selfsimilar way : turbulence , large - scale structure formation in the universe , high - energetic multiparticle dynamics and diffusion limited aggregation are but a few examples showing scaling over a wide range .",
    "a convenient tool to characterize the spatial configurations of these processes is the multifractal formalism @xcite@xcite which analyses the one - point statistics of singularity strengths under the assumption of multiple local scale invariance .",
    "typically , scale - invariance is a consequence of some hierarchical organisation of the underlying process .",
    "since this process occurs in space , its characterisation in terms of multifractals can be expected also to yield information about spatial correlation functions .",
    "multivariate correlations , on the other hand , have long been known to contain ( at least in principle ) complete information of the underlying random process .",
    "moments and especially cumulants are capable , in their multivariate form , of providing this information by means of well - tested statistical procedures . as in the case of multifractals , cumulants can detect and characterize scale invariance , but unlike the former do not depend on its presence .",
    "the existence of these two sets of tools naturally leads to the question how they are interrelated : given a selfsimilar process , does the multifractal characterisation completely determine the spatial correlation functions and vice versa , or does one provide more information than the other ?",
    "some attempts have been made to elucidate the relationship between multifractals and correlation functions : two - point statistics of multifractal measures have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and applied to turbulence in @xcite .",
    "it is to be expected , though , that only the full @xmath0-point statistics of singularity strengths would provide the equivalent information contained in the spatial correlation functions of all orders .",
    "it is known that different selfsimilar processes can lead to identical multifractal exponents @xcite .",
    "this can be understood as a hint that the multifractal characterisation is indeed incomplete and that the spatial correlation functions may contain more information about the underlying process .",
    "we shall show that this is indeed the case for several examples of multiplicative branching processes .",
    "the ultimate goal for any analysis , of course , would be a characterisation of the multivariate statistics gained from a physical process to a degree of completeness that would permit precise reconstruction of the `` branching rule '' that governs each step of the selfsimilar process .",
    "as far as theory is concerned , this holy grail would be achieved with the specification of a multivariate generating function whose @xmath0-fold derivatives would precisely reproduce the corresponding experimentally measured @xmath0-variate cumulants .    clearly , finding this real - life generating function remains beyond present - day capabilities , for both theoretical and experimental reasons .",
    "it is possible , though , to make progress towards the ideal by inventing simple branching models whose generating functions can be calculated .",
    "an approach to calculate the @xmath0-point spatial correlations to arbitrary order within some of these models was presented in refs .",
    "@xcite : there , the multivariate generating function of the spatial correlations was constructed iteratively from a backward evolution equation , leading to a recursive derivation of spatial correlations .",
    "an important further step has been the recent discovery of a large class of analytic solutions for generating functions of selfsimilar multiplicative branching processes @xcite .    in this paper , we expand on the latter discovery and attempt to cast further light on said relationship between multifractals and correlations .",

    "random multiplicative branching processes , sometimes also called weight - curdling models or simply cascade models , can be constructed for any number of branches per splitting . for simplicity , we concentrate on binary processes ; generalizations are straightforward .",
    "the branching rule governing a binary cascade is described as follows : a starting energy density @xmath1 , uniformly distributed on the unit interval , is split up into two daughter densities @xmath2 and @xmath3 living on adjacent subintervals of length @xmath4 .",
    "the random weights @xmath5 and @xmath6 , often also called multipliers or splitting parameters , are drawn from a joint probability density ( or `` splitting function '' ) @xmath7 . in the next generation , each of the two daughter energy densities is itself split up by the same branching rule into two granddaughters distributed uniformly over adjacent subintervals of length @xmath8 .",
    "generally , energy densities of the @xmath9-th generation , @xmath10 , are characterized by the binary index @xmath11 , with each @xmath12 taking on possible values 0 or 1 . successive repetition of this prescription for each @xmath13 of the @xmath9-th generation yields , at the next branching , @xmath14 energy densities @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with the multipliers drawn from a splitting function @xmath17 , which usually ( although not necessarily ) is identical with @xmath7 .",
    "the process is completed after @xmath18 cascade steps .",
