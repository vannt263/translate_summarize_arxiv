    "in addressing the physics of high temperature superconductivity ( htc ) , an important , but often overlooked , issue is the relation between the lattice structure and the electronic physics . in the highly studied  214 \" family of htc superconductors",
    ", there is a structural phase transition from a high temperature tetragonal ( htt ) to a low temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) phase with a transition temperature , @xmath6 which drops as a function of doped hole concentration , @xmath7 , from @xmath8k in undoped , to @xmath9 in with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we were initially motivated to examine the problem of interlayer magnetic coupling because , in the nel state , the coupling between near - neighbor planes is frustrated in both the t - phase of the 214 compounds ( _ e.g. _ , lsco and sr@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 @xcite ) , and the t-phase ( _ e.g. _ pr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 or nd@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ) @xcite ) due to the location of the cu@xmath11 ions on a body - centered tetragonal lattice .",
    "the htt - lto transition of the t - phase removes the frustration , and always occurs well above any magnetic ordering temperature , @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "no lattice distortion has been identified in the t systems , even though the transition temperature to the magnetically ordered nel state is similar for compounds with the two structures @xcite .",
    "the question we address is how a purely electronic system , with no lattice coupling , could spontaneously break the point group symmetry which results in the perfect cancellation of the magnetic coupling between the sublattices .",
    "this approach is contrary to conventional wisdom , which holds that the htt - lto transition in lco is driven by a lattice parameter mismatch between the cuo@xmath2 planes and the interstitial layer la - o .",
    "there are , however , reasons to question whether this explanation is complete : * 1 ) * doping with ba ions could be expected to relieve the stress more efficiently than doping with sr , because of its larger ionic radius . it does nt seem to do that : the t@xmath12 at roughly x=0.20 in both cases . *",
    "2 ) * the in - plane magnetic susceptibility is found to be spectacularly anisotropic @xcite below t@xmath13 ( @xmath14 is between two and three times larger than @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 refer to the orthorhombic a and b axes ) ; were the electronic anisotropy simply a response to the symmetry breaking lattice distortion , then especially at temperatures above @xmath1 but below @xmath0 , one would expect the anisotropy of any electronic response to be small in proportion to the magnitude of the orthorhombic distortion , which is around 4% in these materials .",
    "we consider undoped where , due to the strong repulsions between electrons , the low energy electronic physics is well approximated by a quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet with a single spin 1/2 on each cu site .",
    "we define a continuum field theory ( a @xmath18 non - linear sigma model with @xmath19 ) in terms of the corresponding long - wave - length excitations , and solve it in the large @xmath20 limit ( _ i.e. _ in the self - consistent phonon approximation ) .",
    "we show that the spin model undergoes a similar sequence of two phase transitions upon cooling as does  a high temperature t - o transition and a lower temperature transition , @xmath21 , at which spin - rotation invariance is spontaneously broken resulting in a neel state .",
    "( this corresponds to the schematic phase diagram in fig . 2c . )",
    "the t - o transition in this model is an ising transition and is an example of  order by disorder without order \" , as we explain below .",
    "the magnetic order is collinear , consistent with what is determined for .",
    "however , the difference between the two transition temperatures is very small , @xmath22 , while what is observed in is a substantial difference , @xmath23 ; thus , it is clear that the lattice degrees of freedom play a very significant ( possibly dominant ) role in the stabilization of the lto phase in these materials .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0 and @xmath24 are very close in the bilayer cuprate la@xmath2cacuo@xmath5 @xcite , and the model may apply in this case .",
    "we start by defining a model of @xmath25 coupled layers , each of which consists of a square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet , with the sites on one layer situated above the plaquette center of the layer below : h&&=_n=1^m_r__0 j 2  * s*_n , r_n , r+_0 + & & + _ n=1^m-1 _ r__1j_n^  * s*_n , r_n+1,r+_1 [ h ] where @xmath26 is the spin at site @xmath27 in plane @xmath28 and the sums over @xmath29 and @xmath30 run , respectively , over pairs nearest - neighbor sites within a plane and in neighboring planes : @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( in units in which the in - plane lattice constant @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 $ ] , @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "below , we will consider the bilayer ( @xmath36 ) and the body - centered tetragonal ( @xmath37 ) versions of this problem .",
    "we will also consider cases in which the spacing between the layers are not all the same so that @xmath38 is @xmath28 dependent , but we will always assume @xmath39 .    in a classically neel ordered state , @xmath40 with @xmath41 , there is no coupling between the staggered order parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in the two planes .",
    "however , high energy short wave - length quantum fluctuations induce an additional effective interaction between the spins at low energy , @xmath44 : h_ind=-_n=1^m-1_r k_n^2 [ hind ] where @xmath45 $ ] is a composite order parameter field and from a spin - wave expansion for large spin , @xmath46 , we would find that @xmath47 . however , since in many of the physical realizations of this model , @xmath46 is 1/2 or 1 , it is better to think of generating @xmath48 in the first stage of a renormalization group proceedure in which short - wave - length , high energy modes are integrated out . ]",
    "for @xmath50 , the staggered moments on neighboring planes tend to be colinear to maximize the expectation value of @xmath51 .",
    "rotation by @xmath52 about an axis through any lattice site @xmath53 on plane @xmath28 is a symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "such a rotation transforms @xmath54 , so any state with @xmath55 is a state of broken symmetry .",
    "for instance , the state pictured in fig .",
    "1 has @xmath56 , but upon rotation by @xmath52 about a site in the lower plane , one obtains the state in which all the spins in the upper layer are reversed , and hence @xmath57 changes sign .",
    "more generally , a non - zero @xmath58 occurs only in a state in which the discrete c@xmath3 rotational symmetry of the lattice is broken down to c@xmath2 , _ i.e. _ in an `` ising nematic '' state , or equivalently an electronically orthorhombic state .",
    "_ in two dimensions : _ a mechanism is called  order by disorder \" when it is driven by fluctuation induced terms that are absent at the mean - field level @xcite .",
    "a classic example is the bilayer of heisenberg antiferromagnet shown in fig .",
    "1(the case @xmath36 ) .",
    "here , in addition to the usual ground - state degeneracy which is implied by the spontaneous breaking of spin - rotation symmetry , at mean - field level there is an added ( continuous ) degeneracy due to the frustrated character of the intersystem coupling ; the orientation of the staggered magnetization on the upper layer can be rotated by an arbitrary angle relative to that on the lower layer at no cost in energy .",
    "however , quantum fluctuations ( eq . [ hind ] ) lift this degeneracy and produce a preferred relative orientation such that the staggered magnetization on the two planes is colinear .",
    "as we have seen , this state also breaks the discrete rotational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "the fluctuations that lead to order by disorder are predominantly short - wavelength , high energy quantum fluctuations , and hence they produce the same tendency for the spins on neighboring planes to be colinear , even when there is no long - range spin order .",
    "for instance , since the bilayer problem is a 2d problem , at any finite temperature , @xmath59 , spin rotation symmetry can not be spontaneously broken . however , the ising nematic order can ( and does ) survive to finite @xmath59 @xcite . thus , although originally conceived as being a consequence of small fluctuations about a magnetically ordered state , the tendency of these fluctuations to produce this order persists even when long - wavelength fluctuations have destroyed the antiferromagnetic order , itself , leaving @xmath60 -hence @xcite `` ordering by disorder without order . ''",
    "we can estimate the transition temperature as being the point at which the induced interaction between correlated blocks of spins is of order @xmath59 ( in units in which @xmath61 ) k_s^2 ~t_to^(bi ) [ twodim ] since @xmath62 $ ] , the ordering temperature , @xmath63 $ ] is significantly smaller than @xmath64 only if @xmath65 is astronomically small .",
    "( here @xmath66 for spin 1/2 due to quantum corrections . ) the resulting phase diagram is shown in the schematic phase diagram ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : layer ] . _ in three dimensions : _ the magnetic hamiltonian on the htt lattice is the three dimensional extension of the same model , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath48 are indenpendent of the layer index , @xmath28 .",
    "however , to place the problem in a broader context , in fig .",
    "2 we have considered a somewhat more general version of this hamiltonian in which @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for @xmath71 , this corresponds to the ltt structure of , while for @xmath72 this corresponds to an array of decoupled bilayers .",
    "the behavior of the phase boundaries for @xmath73 can be readily deduced from the single bilayer results by scaling .",
    "the neel temperature rises steeply from zero as @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "the t - o transition rises from its finite bilayer value as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the susceptibility exponent of the 2d ising model .    to obtain a general solution valid for @xmath77",
    ", we can no longer perturb about the isolated bilayer , and so must rely on other , approximate methods .",
    "we start with the following continuum hamiltonian ,    h_c = dxdy_n=1^m [ ( _ s(|_n |^2+|_n |^2 ) -g_1 ( * * _ n _ n ) ^2+_n _ x_y * * _ n -g_2(**_n _ n-1)^2+_n _ x_y * * _ n-1 ] [ hc ]    where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the local staggered magnetization order parameters in even and odd layers and @xmath80 . here the spin stiffness @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "( we have considered multiple coupled bilayers , but by making @xmath86 and @xmath87 dependent on layer index , the more general model can be studied as well . ) we also take the order parameters to be @xmath20 component vectors , generalizing from the physical @xmath19 , since in the large @xmath20 limit ( which we expect to be qualitatively correct for @xmath19 ) the phase diagram of above model can be obtained as follows .",
    "the partition function is given by z = d^1 d^2 dddexp(-dxdy_n l_n ) where the lagrangian is given by    = & & ^1_n(|_n|^2 - 1)+^2_n(|_n|^2 - 1)+ 2[_1n(_n _ n ) + _ 2n(_n _ n-1 ) ] + + + [ _ s(|_n |^2+|_n",

    "the saddle point of above lagrangian is determined the following self - consistent equations by taking @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( subject to the stability condition @xmath94 ) : _ i&= & d^2k dk_z ( cos k_z g_00 -(-1)^i sin k_z g_01)[self ] + 1&=&m^2 + d^2k dk_z g_00 where we have taken @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the staggered moment which is non - zero only in the magnetically ordered phase , the integral for @xmath97 has an ultra - violet cuttoff @xmath98 , and g(k_x , k_y , k_z)= (    cc a(k ) & b(k ) + -b(k ) & a(k )    ) ^-1 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "first , let us look the uniform case @xmath103 and @xmath104 . if @xmath105 , the above self consistent equation can be solved exactly .",
    "there is a first order transition at @xmath106 given by @xmath107 . for @xmath108 ,",

    ", there is a family of solutions with @xmath111 and @xmath112 . for @xmath113 ,",
    "the minimal solution has @xmath114 and non - zero magnetization , m^2 = - .",
    "the transition at @xmath106 is a peculiar : the orthorhombic order parameter jumps to a finite expectation value , @xmath115 , just below @xmath106 , making it a first order transition . at the same time",
    ", the magnetization grows continuously from zero as @xmath59 drops below @xmath106 .",
    "( unsurprisingly , the coincidence of the two transitions is lifted , as we shall see now , by non - zero @xmath87 .",
    ") of course , because @xmath116 , there is a gapless ( goldstone ) mode for all @xmath117 .    when @xmath118 , there are two phase transitions .",
    "the first one is a second order ising - type transition at @xmath0 and the second one is the neel transition at @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath119 for any nonzero value of @xmath87 .",
    "the ising transition is marked at @xmath0 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 and the neel transition happens at @xmath24 where @xmath116 . from these conditions , equations which determine @xmath0 and @xmath24",
    "can be derived . while it can be proved that the solutions of the equations exist and satisfy @xmath119 when @xmath122 , it would be tedious to present the proof . however , when @xmath87 is small , we can solve the critical temperatures up to the second order of @xmath87 .",
    "expanding the self consistent equations up to the second order of @xmath87 and defining @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the two critical temperatures are determined by = 1 + , = 1 + . from these equations , it is transparent that @xmath119 . up to the second order in @xmath125 ,",
    "the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath24 is given by t = t_to -t_n = [ result ]    while this result shows that the fluctuations will induce the ising order transition before the temperature reaches the neel transition , as @xmath87 is expected to be small , it follows that for the uniform case , so is @xmath126 . for nonuniform coupling parameters",

    "in @xmath154 , the htt to lto transition occurs at roughly twice @xmath24 , and so is inconsistent with our findings .",
    "probably , this signifies a significant role of the lattice degrees of freedom in driving the transition .",
    "however , this does not necessarily imply that the electronic considerations found here are entirely unimportant - in particular , the order one anisotropy in the magnetic susceptibility@xcite in the temperature range between @xmath24 and @xmath0 argues in favor of a significant electronic contribution to the transition . a more compelling case for an electronically driven transition to an orthorhombic phase",
    "can be made for the two - layer compound la@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath5 , where the magnetic and structural transitions are observed and they are close together in temperature @xcite .",
    "it is a very general feature of the fluctuation induced coupling between frustrated planes that @xmath155 , and hence that the induced order is collinear .",
    "however , a finite concentration of vacancies can induce the opposite sign of interplane coupling which can therefore lead to non - collinear ordering of magnetic moments in different layers@xcite . when a vacancy is created in one plane , the lto order near the vacancy is destroyed .",
    "the effect of vacancies on @xmath0 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ van ] . at mean - field level , the net field applied on any spin in one plane due to the spins in the plane below is zero ; however , where there is a vacancy in the lower plane , all the neighboring spins in the next plane feel a net field which is @xmath156 times minus the spin that was removed to make the vacancy . as is well known , an applied field in an antiferromagnet favors the ordered moments in the plan perpendicular to the field , which permits a net canting of the spins in the direction of the applied field  this is the driving force for the usual spin - flop transition .",
    "thus , there is a negative contribution to the average coupling , @xmath157 which is proportional to the vacancy concentration , @xmath158 .",
    "we note the af systems @xmath159cuo@xmath3 ( @xmath160= nd , pr , gd , eu ) @xcite forming in the t structure exhibit the combination of no detectable orthorhombic distortion _ and _ non - collinear ground states .",
    "possibly , the difference of the t compounds from la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 is the moment associated with the rare earth atoms ( for eu atoms , due to the relatively small energy gap between the first excited state and the ground state , they carry significant magnetic moments at 300k although the ground state is nonmagnetic ) ; including them leads to a magnetic hamiltonian different from eq .",
