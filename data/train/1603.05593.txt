    "let @xmath0 be a complete discrete valuation field , with @xmath1 its ring of integers and @xmath2 its residue field .",
    "let @xmath3 be an @xmath4-dimensional @xmath0-vector space .",
    "a lattice of @xmath5 is a finitely generated @xmath6-submodule @xmath7 of @xmath5 such that @xmath8 .",
    "for example , @xmath9 is a lattice in @xmath5 .",
    "the main purpose of the lecture notes is to endow the set of lattices of @xmath5 ( and its variants and generalisations ) with a structure as an infinite dimensional algebraic variety , known as the affine grassmannian @xmath10 , to study its geometric properties , and to give some of its applications .    but let us start with an incomplete list of motivations of studying such object .",
    "the first motivation lies in the relationship between loop algebras / groups and kac - moody algebras / groups .",
    "since every lattice can be translated to @xmath11 by a linear automorphism of @xmath5 , @xmath10 is naturally identified with @xmath12 as a set . when @xmath13 , the group @xmath14 is closely related to an affine kac - moody group over @xmath2 .",
    "realising @xmath10 as a ( partial ) flag variety of the kac - moody group is important for representation theory of affine kac - moody algebras .",
    "a precise relation between them will be briefly discussed in   [ kac - moody ] .",
    "the second motivation is the study of moduli of vector bundles on an algebraic curve .",
    "let @xmath15 be a smooth projective algebraic curve over @xmath2 , and let @xmath16 be a point .",
    "we identify the complete local ring of @xmath15 at @xmath17 with @xmath18 $ ] by choosing a local coordinate @xmath19 around @xmath17",
    ". then one can identify @xmath10 with the following set @xmath20 therefore , there is a map from @xmath10 to the set of isomorphism classes of rank @xmath4 vector bundles on @xmath15 .",
    "the latter in fact is the underlying set of points of a much more sophisticated algebro - geometric object , namely the moduli stack @xmath21 of rank @xmath4 vector bundles on @xmath15 .",
    "it is therefore very desirable to upgrade the above set - theoretical map to a morphism @xmath22 of algebro - geometric objects .",
    "such a morphism is called the uniformization map , and is an important tool to study certain geometric properties of @xmath21 .",
    "we refer to   [ one point uniformization ] for more detailed explanations of this idea .",
    "the third motivation comes from the study of some ( locally ) closed subvarieties in @xmath10 , arising from various aspects of the langlands program .",
    "the list of such subvarieties include affine springer fibers ( related to harmonic analysis on reductive groups over non - archimedean local fields ) , affine deligne - lusztig varieties ( related to reduction of shimura varieties mod @xmath23 ) an kisin varieties ( related to deformation spaces of galois representations ) .",
    "we refer to   [ digression ] for an introduction of these varieties .",
    "the fourth motivation also comes from the langlands program .",
    "namely , the satake isomorphism , which describes the ring of @xmath24-bi - invariant functions on @xmath14 , is the starting point of the langlands duality .",
    "it turns out that the satake isomorphism admits a vast generalisation , known as the geometric satake equivalence .",
    "this is the starting point of the geometric langlands program , and in recent years also finds some unexpected applications to the classical arithmetic langlands program ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "but even in order to formulate the geometric satake equivalence , we need to know the algebro - geometric structure on @xmath10 .      [ [ section ] ]    the notes are based on five lectures given at the park city mathematical institute in summer of 2015 .",
    "they are aimed as a serious introduction to the subject .",
    "that said , we will address ( what we think ) the most basic and important aspects of the subject .",
    "certainly there are many other important topics untouched in the notes , partly due to the limitation of the space and partly due to the author s incapability .",
    "on the other hand , we hope that these notes form a supplement rather than a supplantation of the existing literature .",
    "therefore , we do not give a detailed proof of every result , in particular when such a proof already exists in literature .",
    "instead we shall point out relevant references . on the other hand ,",
    "there are some well - known and widely used results for which no ( complete ) proofs seem to exist in literature . in that case",
    ", we will try to supply the details .",
    "the notes contain a few results that did not appear in literature before , although it is quite plausible that they are well - known to experts .",
    "such results include , for example , the calculation of the relative picard sheaves of beilinson - drinfeld grassmannians (   [ line bundle on bd grass ] ) .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    we briefly describe the contents of each section .",
    "section [ lecture i ] explains basic constructions , including various ( moduli ) interpretations of affine grassmannians .",
    "we will also introduce the important determinant line bundle , and discuss a relationship between affine grassmannians over complex numbers and the based loop groups .",
    "although mostly we consider groups over an equal characteristic local field , at the end of this section we briefly discuss the recent progress of defining affine grassmannians for @xmath23-adic groups .",
    "section [ lecture ii ] studies some basic geometry of affine grassmannians .",
    "we will introduce various subvarieties in the affine grassmannian , including schubert varieties , opposite schubert `` varieties '' , transversal slices , and some important subvarieties arising from the langlands program .",
    "we study the picard group of the affine grassmannian for a simple simply - connected group @xmath25 .",
    "we also briefly discuss the relation between affine grassmannians and partial flag varieties of affine kac - moody groups .",
    "the interpretation of affine grassmannians as certain moduli of bundles on curves admits a vast generalisation , known as beilinson - drinfeld grassmannians .",
    "section [ lecture iii ] is devoted to these objects .",
    "a salient feature of beilinson - drinfeld grassmannians is the factorisation property .",
    "we explain this property in some details , in particular formulate it via the ran space of a curve .",
    "we also discuss line bundles on beilinson - drinfeld grassmannians .",
    "section [ lecture iv ] discusses some applications of affine grassmannians to the study of moduli of bundles on curves .",
    "the basic tools are uniformization theorems .",
    "in fact , there are two types of such theorems : one point uniformization which is valid when @xmath25 is semisimple , and the adlic uniformization , which is the algebro - geometric version of weil s adlic description of the isomorphism classes of @xmath25-bundles on a curve . as an application",
    ", we give a description of the picard group of the moduli of @xmath25-bundles on a smooth projective curve when @xmath25 is simple and simply - connected , and interpret global sections of line bundles on the moduli space as conformal blocks .",
    "section [ lecture v ] is devoted to the geometric satake equivalence .",
    "the theory is naturally divided into two parts .",
    "the first part is the construction of a tannakian category from certain category of perverse sheaves on the affine grassmannian .",
    "a key ingredient is the fusion product structure on the category , whose construction relies on the factorisation property of beilinson - drinfeld grassmannians .",
    "the second part is the study of the tannakian group . here",
    "the main ingredient is the mirkovi - vilonen theory on the geometry of semi - infinite orbits .",
    "we also explain how to extend the geometric satake equivalence to the forms that are suitable for applications to the ( geometric ) langlands program . at the end of this section ,",
    "we explain how to recover the classical satake isomorphism from the geometric one .",
    "there is also an appendix where we collect some backgrounds on @xmath26-adic sheaves that are used in the section [ lecture v ] .",
    "now we fix notations and conventions that will be used throughout the notes .",
    "readers are _ strongly _ suggested to skip this subsection and come back only when necessary .",
