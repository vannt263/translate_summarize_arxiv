    "<S> we study the constraints that can be placed on anomalous @xmath0-lepton couplings at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we use an effective lagrangian description for physics beyond the standard model which contains the @xmath0-lepton anomalous magnetic moment , electric dipole moment and weak dipole moments in two operators of dimension six . </S>",
    "<S> we include in our study two additional operators of dimension eight that directly couple the @xmath0-leptons to gluons and are therefore enhanced at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the two main effects from these couplings : modifications to the drell - yan cross - section and to the @xmath0-lepton pair production in association with a higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a measurement of the former at the 14% level can produce constraints comparable to existing ones for the anomalous dipole couplings ; and that a bound on the latter at a sensitivity level of @xmath1 or better would produce the best constraint on the @xmath0-gluonic couplings . </S>"
