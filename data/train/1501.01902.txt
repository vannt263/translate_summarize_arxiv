    "<S> note that the nontrivial topology is maintained as long as only the 5@xmath1 is occupied @xmath35 the 6@xmath4 remains unoccupied . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[elects ] displays this electron amount as a function of the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , on the other side of the phase diagram , wherein non - triviality is manifested due to a @xmath29 inversion , we calculate the amount of electrons that can be contained in the 6@xmath4 band before beginning to populate the 5@xmath1 band . </S>",
    "<S> equilibrium lattice constants for the 3 + and 2 + limiting cases are estimated using spin - polarized l(s)da+so+@xmath15 schemes ( see supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the theoretical estimated valence and lattice constants always yield a topological nontrivial ground state . </S>",
    "<S> though the estimate from an empirical extrapolation for the smo valence places the bulk in the trivial region of the phase diagram , nontrivial topology is quickly reinstated for lattice parameters with a small tensile strain ( @xmath30 1% ) . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopy experiments are necessary to confirm the samarium valency , and positions of the samarium @xmath4 and @xmath1 bands with respect to the @xmath0 states in bulk smo and smo thin films .    by virtue of the large surface to volume ratio , </S>",
    "<S> thin films of systems with nontrivial topology with dominant surface states are highly sought - after . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the simple @xmath13 symmetry and the flexibility in observing the topological ground state in smo for a wide range of lattice parameters , we anticipate plenty of options for suitable substrates </S>",
    "<S> . one particular substrate that invokes special interest is the @xmath13 ferromagnetic semiconductor euo@xcite , which has a lattice constant of 5.14 , only a 4% lattice mismatch with that of bulk smo . </S>",
    "<S> euo by itself is an attractive material with many functionalities , including metal - insulator transition , magnetic phase transition , colossal magneto - resistance , etc@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these functionalities have produced an abundance of research on growing high quality thin films of euo . </S>",
    "<S> so , a quick progress in the engineering of smo / euo thin film interfaces can be expected . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , this would open up the possibility for another experimental realization of the qahe , this time in a strongly correlated electron system with topologically nontrivial flat bands . despite the lack of a bulk band gap in cr - doped ( bi , sb)@xmath8te@xmath9 thin films , </S>",
    "<S> qahe was observed at 30 mk@xcite . in a similar manner </S>",
    "<S> , the presence of a semi - metallic bulk in smo will give rise to bulk carriers , but given the tiny electron and hole pockets around x and @xmath25 respectively , and by making use of thin films , the amount of bulk charge carriers can be kept quite small and should not completely overshadow the qahe .    in summary , we have investigated in detail the electronic structure of smo and established the nontrivial topology of the band structure such that smo can be classified as a 3d strongly topological semi - metal . </S>",
    "<S> the topological state in smo is very robust and prevails for a wide range of lattice parameters , which leads us to propose smo as an ideal candidate for further investigations of topologically nontrivial correlated flat bands in bulk and thin - film form .    </S>",
