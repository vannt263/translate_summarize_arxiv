    "using it the analytical calculation of different corrections to hfs can be performed .",
    "contrary to the energy levels of two - particle bound states which were accurately calculated in quantum electrodynamics @xcite , the hyperfine splitting of the ground state in muonic helium atom was calculated on the basis of the perturbation theory with essentially less accuracy .",
    "another approach is built on the variatinal method @xcite which allows to increase the accuracy of the calculation . in the beginning",
    ", the accuracy of the hfs calculation was not sufficiently high because corrections of six order in @xmath0 were estimated only approximately .",

    "in the present study , we have performed the analytical and numerical calculation of several important contributions to the hyperfine splitting of the ground state in muonic helium atom connected with the vacuum polarization , the nuclear structure , recoil effects and the electron vertex corrections . to solve this task we use the method of the perturbation theory which was formulated previously for the description of the muonic helium hyperfine splitting in refs.@xcite .",
    "we have considered corrections of the electron vacuum polarization , electron electromagnetic form factors and the nuclear structure effects of orders @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the numerical values of the corresponding contributions are displayed in table i. we present in table i the references to the calculations of other corrections which are not considered here . the relativistic correction was obtained in ref.@xcite , the electron vertex corrections of order @xmath260 were calculated in the case of hydrogenic atoms in refs.@xcite .",
    "basic contributions to the hyperfine splitting obtained by lakdawala and mohr are also included in table i because our calculation is closely related to their approach .",

    "the vacuum polarization effects are important for obtaining the high accuracy of the calculation .",
    "they give rise to the modification of the two - particle interaction potential which provides the @xmath261-order corrections to the hyperfine structure .",
    "the next to leading order vacuum polarization corrections ( two - loop vacuum polarization ) are negligible .",
    "the electron vertex corrections to the coefficient @xmath40 should be considered with the exact account of the one - loop electromagnetic form factors of the electron because the characteristic momentum incoming in the electron vertex operator is of order of the electron mass .",
    "\\4 . analyzing the one - loop electron vacuum polarization and vertex effects and the nuclear structure contributions in each order in @xmath0 , we have taken into account recoil terms proportional to the ratio of the electron and muon masses .",
    "the resulting numerical value 4466.471 mhz of the smaller ground state hyperfine splitting in muonic helium @xmath5 is presented in table i. it is sufficiently close both to the experimental result ( 1 ) and the earlier performed calculations by the perturbation theory , variational approach in @xcite .",
    "the estimation of the theoretical uncertainty can be done in terms of the fermi energy @xmath262 and small parameters @xmath0 and the ratio of the particle masses . on our opinion , there exist several main sources of the theoretical errors .",
    "first of all , as we mentioned above comprehensive analytical and numerical calculation of recoil corrections of orders @xmath263 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 was carried out by lakdawala and mohr in the second order pt in refs.@xcite .",
    "the error of their calculation connected with the correction @xmath266 consists 0.6 mhz .",
    "the second source of the error is related to contributions of order @xmath267 mhz which appear both from qed amplitudes and in higher orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "another part of the theoretical error is determined by the two - photon three - body exchange amplitudes mentioned above .",
    "they are of the fifth order over @xmath0 and contain the recoil parameter @xmath268 , so that their possible numerical value can be equal @xmath269 mhz .",
    "finally , a part of theoretical error is connected with our calculation of the electron vertex corrections of order @xmath3 in section iv .",
    "it consists at least 0.2 mhz ( see the discussion after eq.(80 ) ) .",
    "we neglect also the electron vertex contributions of order @xmath270 mhz which appear in higher orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "thereby , the total theoretical uncertainty is not exceeded @xmath271 mhz .",
    "the existing difference between the obtained theoretical result and experimental value of the hyperfine splitting ( 1 ) equal to 0.171 mhz lies in the range of total error .",
    "theoretical error which remains sufficiently large in the comparison with the experimental uncertainty , initiates further theoretical investigation of the higher order recoil contributions and more careful construction of the three - particle interaction operator connected with the multiphoton exchanges .",
