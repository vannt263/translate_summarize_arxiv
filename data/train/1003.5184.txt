    "_ kinematical degrees of freedom _ :    any quantum system with an n - dimensional hilbert space has @xmath0 kinematical degrees of freedom . its group of canonical transformations , i.e. the kinematical group , is @xmath1 so that any hamiltonian , i.e. hermitian operator , can be digitalized using some of the @xmath1 transformations , leading to @xmath0 formal integrals of motion and formal integrability .",
    "evolution of the quantum system is equivalent to a linear symplectic flow on a symplectic manifold , which is completely integrable in the sense of classical hamiltonian systems ( please see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "all pure states can be connected by some unitary transformation so that all pure states are in fact @xmath1 generalized coherent states .",
    "the assumption that any hermitian operator represents a measurable quantity , an observable , is actually an assumption concerning physically possible interactions with the environment , and is not justified in many cases such as : systems of identical particles , presence of symmetries , relativistic locality etc ....    _ dynamical algebra of relevant observables _    the notion of k - freedom is to formal to be physically relevant .",
    "a particular physical system is specified , and thus distinguished from an abstract general framework , by describing what can be measured on it , i.e. by specifying the set of observables , and by expressing the interactions within the system in terms of the observables . in order words ,",
    "the class of physically relevant observables should be described and the evolution should be expressed in terms of these observables .",
    "structure of the set of observables is fixed by their algebraic relations . in quantum mechanics operators representing the physical quantities pertinent to the given system",
    "are required to realize the corresponding algebra .",
    "the algebraic relations between the observables also fix the relevant hilbert space of the system as the space of an irreducible representation . the algebra defined in this way",
    "is called the systems dynamical algebra .",
    "thus , a quantum system has fixed dynamical algebra . description of a quantum system amounts to the specification of its state space , algebra of observables , or the dynamical algebra g , and the hamiltonian which is an expression ( possibly nonlinear ) in terms of operators belonging to g.    in what follows we shall consider a quantum system @xmath2 with a hilbert space @xmath3 which is an irrep space of the dynamical ( lie ) algebra @xmath4 and the hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamical algebra @xmath4 will always be a semi - simple lie algebra , with rank @xmath6 and dimension @xmath7 .",
    "dynamical degrees of freedom are fixed by the full description of the system , and are defined using the dynamical algebra .",
    "the dynamical algebra @xmath4 has @xmath8 different chains of subalgebras : @xmath9 .",
    "casimir operators of @xmath4 and all the algebras in ( any of ) the subalgebra chain form the relevant complete set of commuting operators ( csco ) @xmath10 .",
    "there is @xmath11 of these , independently of the subalgebra chain .",
    "some of these casimir operators are fully degenerate in the sense that they are represented by scalar operators : @xmath12 for every @xmath13 .",
    "the number of non - fully degenerate operators in csco is @xmath14 is chain independent but might depend on the particular irrep i.e. on the system s hilbert space , and defines the number of idf .",
    "the non - fully degenerate operators in a particular chain are the operators that define @xmath15 idf .",
    "the quantum system is fully specified only when @xmath16 its hilbert space ; @xmath17 the set of @xmath15 operators representing idf and @xmath18 the hamiltonian , which is a possibly nonlinear expression in terms of the dynamical algebra generators , are given .    if the dynamical algebra @xmath4 of a quantum system @xmath19 can be represented as a direct sum of dynamical algebras of two systems @xmath20 and @xmath21 , that is @xmath22 , then the tensor product of irreps of @xmath23 and @xmath24 is an irrep space of @xmath25 , that is @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the ranks and dimensions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , then in general the number of idf of @xmath19 is @xmath31 .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath22 the system @xmath19 can be represented as a union of two systems and the number of idf is additive .",
    "if the dynamical algebra @xmath4 of the system is semisimple then it can be uniquely expressed as a direct sum of mutually commutative and orthogonal simple algebras : @xmath32 and the hilbert space which is an irrep space of @xmath4 factors as @xmath33 .",
    "thus , in the case of semisimple dynamical algebra the number of idf is additive , but the number of idf in all the factor systems with @xmath34 dynamical algebras need not be unity for each @xmath34 .",
    "an example of the system when this is the case is given by a system of qubits , and shall be treated in some detail later .",
    "however , a dynamical algebra @xmath4 need not be representable as a product of dynamical lie algebras with the number of idf equal to one , as for example if @xmath35 or if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are independent fermions or bosons , even if the number of idf of @xmath4 is larger then one ( for example in the @xmath36 case it is 2 or 3 depending on the irrep , as discussed in section 3.4 ) .      @xmath37 has the corresponding lie group @xmath38 as the dynamical symmetry if the hamiltonian @xmath5 can be expressed in terms of the csco of a particular subgroup chain used to define the idf . in this case",
    "the system has a symmetry of the subgroup chain .",
    "in particular @xmath3 commutes with @xmath15 non - fully degenerate operators that define the idf .",
    "a system @xmath37 is quantum integrable by definition if it has @xmath38 dynamical symmetry with respect to the subgroup chain that is used to define the idf .",
    "@xmath38 symmetry is defined as quantum integrability in analogy with complete integrability in the presence of symmetry in the case of classical hamiltonian systems .",
    "quantum hamiltonian systems which do not satisfy the definition of quantum integrability are called quantum nonintegrable .",
    "it should be stressed that the qualitative properties of the state dynamics with quantum integrable and quantum non - integrable hamiltonians are the same . from the point of view of the hamiltonian dynamical systems theory the state orbits are in either case regular that is periodic or quasi - periodic .",
    "quantum non - integrable systems do not generate chaotic orbits in the system s state space ( please see for example @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamical properties of orbits of the classical models ( please see the next subsection ) corresponding to the quantum integrable or non - integrable systems are quite different , and chaotic orbits do occur in the classical model of the quantum non - integrable systems with more than one idf .    it should be noticed that quantum systems with one degree of freedom , unlike the one freedom classical hamiltonian systems , need not be quantum integrable , for example if the hamiltonian is a nonlinear expression of the algebra generators .      total level of quantum fluctuations in a pure state @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 where the sum is taken over an orthonormal bases of the dynamical algebra @xmath4 .",
    "it make sense to consider the quantity @xmath41 as a measure of quantumness of the state @xmath42 .",
    "physical motivation for the definition of the generalized @xmath4-coherent states is that they minimize @xmath41 .",
    "this is one of the important properties of the glauber coherent states of the harmonic oscillator i.e. of the haisenberg - weil @xmath43 algebra that is generalized by the @xmath4-coherent states with arbitrary @xmath4 .",
    "there are several generalizations of the glauber , i.e. @xmath43 coherent states .",
    "perelomov @xcite and gillmore @xcite independently introduced two different generalizations based on the group - theoretical structure of the @xmath43 coherent states .",
    "the essential ideas of both approaches are the same , the differences being in the class of lie groups , and the corresponding available tools , and in the choice a reference state . in both approaches ,",
    "the set of @xmath4-coherent states depends , besides the algebra @xmath4 , also on the particular hilbert space @xmath44 caring the irrep @xmath45 of @xmath4 and on the choice of an , in principal ( perelomov ) , arbitrary referencee state , denoted @xmath46 .",
    "the subgroup @xmath47 of @xmath38 which leaves the ray corresponding to the state @xmath46 invariant is called the stability subgroup of @xmath46 : @xmath48 then , for every @xmath49 there is a unique decomposition into the product of two elements , one from @xmath47 and one from the coset @xmath50",
    "so that @xmath51 . the states of the form @xmath52 for all @xmath49 are the @xmath4 coherent states .",
    "thus , geometrically the set of @xmath4 coherent state form a manifold with well defined riemanien and symplectic structure .    in all explicit examples treated here",
    "the dynamical algebra @xmath4 will be semisimple ( or simple ) , which is the case studied by gillmore .",
    "in this case there is the standard cartan basis of @xmath4 : @xmath53 .",
    "the irrep is characterized by the unique highest weight state @xmath54 ( or the lowest weight state @xmath55 ) which is annihilated by all @xmath56 and some @xmath57 .",

    "classical hamiltonian dynamical system on the manifold @xmath64 given by the hamiltonian function @xmath65 is called the classical model of the quantum dynamical system @xmath66 .",
    "classical limit of the quantum system is obtained from the classical model in the limit when some relevant parameter approaches zero .",
    "if the hamiltonian @xmath5 is a linear expression of the dynamical group generators then the quantum system , its classical model and its classical limit have the same dynamics .",
    "the classical model of a quantum nonintegrable system is chaotic in the sense of classical hamiltonian dynamical systems .",
    "dynamics of classical models of quantum nonintegrable systems have been studied for various examples in @xcite .",
    "relation between dynamics of entanglement and the dynamics of classical models for quantum nonintegrable pair of qubits was studied in @xcite .",
    "dynamics of the traditional semi - classical approximation of the quantum systems which are based on quantization of systems with different classical dynamics has been studied intensively@xcite .",
    "it is found that a ) quantum systems obtained by quantization of classical hamiltonian system with qualitatively different dynamics show different spectral properties , and qualitatively different properties of entanglement in eigenstates in different parts of spectra have been observed @xcite ; b ) bipartite standard entanglement , as measured by concurrence , in the wave function initially localized in qualitatively different parts of the phase space of some semi - classical approximation of the quantum system has clearly different dynamics ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "consider a system @xmath19 such that its dynamical group @xmath25 can be factored as a direct product @xmath67 , and its hilbert space @xmath68 written as the tensor product of the irreps @xmath26 .",
    "we have seen that such a system @xmath19 can be viewed as a union of systems @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "a pure state @xmath69 of @xmath19 is entangled by the standard definition if the reduced states @xmath70 $ ] are mixtures i.e. are not projectors .",
    "g - coherent states of the system @xmath19 with @xmath71 are products of @xmath29 and @xmath30 coherent states , by the construction of coherent states with the referent state @xmath72 and are of the form @xmath73 . reduced states @xmath74 of the coherent state @xmath75 are pure and are coherent states of @xmath20 and of @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the coherent states of @xmath25 are disentangled , and the reduced state of the coherent state are also coherent , and thus disentangled for the component algebras .",
    "thus , the set of states with zero entanglement and the set of coherent states can be consistently identified . in this sense",
    "the noncoherent states do posses some entanglement in the generalized sense .",
    "if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are systems with only one idf each , the previous definition assumes that the noncoherent states of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are entangled in the generalized sense .",
    "these states @xmath76 of systems @xmath20 and @xmath21 with number of idf equal to unity",
    "do have nonminimal quantumness @xmath41 , and violate a bell inequality for some set of observables @xcite .    in the considered case the quantumness @xmath77 is in general larger then minimal ,",
    "the minimum being achieved by states which are products of @xmath23 and @xmath24 coherent states .",
    "the quantumness of the state @xmath78 is here manifested in one of the two modes : a ) by quantum correlations between different idf , which is traditionally identified with entanglement , or by b ) quantumness of states of systems with unit number of idf .",
    "the definition of generalized entanglement assumes that nonminimal quantumness of noncoherent states of systems with one idf is equivalent to the generalized entanglement . in either the case @xmath79 or @xmath80 some bell inequality for a convenient choice of observables",
    "is violated by a superposition of @xmath4-coherent states , that is by generalized entangled states .",
    "previous discussion in the case when the dynamical group satisfies @xmath81 is generalized by definition to the general case of the systems with dynamical groups @xmath38 such that the decomposition @xmath82 does not exist .",
    "although the system with such @xmath4 dynamical algebra might have more than one idf it can not be considered as a union of systems with smaller number of idf .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath4-coherent states are defined and constructed as in the general case .",
    "the quantumness @xmath41 is minimal for such coherent states and larger than minimal otherwise .",
    "states which are not @xmath4-coherent have the quantumness larger than minimal and are by definition generalized entangled or @xmath4-entangled states .",
    "quantumness of the state @xmath39 : @xmath41 , normalized so that it is zero for the @xmath4-coherent states can be used as a measure of @xmath4-entanglement .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that it is related to the mayer - wallach @xmath83-measure of multi - partite entanglement in the standard case .",
    "identification of @xmath4-coherent states with @xmath4-disentangled states in the case when the dynamical group does not satisfy @xmath81 should not be questionable .",
    "whether a state should be considered as @xmath4-entangled whenever it is not @xmath4-coherent is a deep question with no general agrement as to the answer @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we adopt the identification of @xmath4-entanglement with @xmath4-noncoherence .",
    "this reduces to the standard definition in the case when @xmath20 and @xmath21 have no entangled states and @xmath81 .",
    "if this definition of @xmath4-entanglement is adopted than quantum integrability and @xmath4-entanglement are clearly related as is explained in the next subsection .",
    "the system @xmath66 is called an entanglement generator if it does not have @xmath4 dynamical symmetry .",
    "the name is justified because an entanglement generator evolves from g - coherent into g - noncoherent states i.e. from g - disentangled into g - entangled states .",
    "such systems produce entanglement by internal dynamics . on the other hand , if @xmath66 is quantum integrable than the set of @xmath84 is dynamically and @xmath38-invariant . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian is not entanglement generator and such a system can be in an entangled state as a result of interaction with external systems .",
    "in other words dynamical separability can be identified with disentanglement .",
    "this properties provide an understanding of the relation between dynamical integrability and entanglement in quantum mechanics and is the main conclusion of our discussion .",
    "the quantum system is described by @xmath86 dimensional hilbert space @xmath87 and the dynamical algebra @xmath85 , which means that every hermitian operator on @xmath87 has physical interpretation as a measurable quantity . due to the normalization and global phase invariance",
    "the state space of the system is @xmath88 which is topologically like @xmath89 , and represents a @xmath90 manifold with riemanien and symplectic structure .",
    "geometrically , it should be natural to associate @xmath0 idf with this system .",
    "the same number of idf follows from @xmath85 dynamical algebra .",
    "the hilbert space is the fully symmetric irrep space of @xmath85 with the highest weight : @xmath91 .",
    "the basis can be labeled by the following chain of subalgebras : @xmath92 with the corresponding casimir operators @xmath93 determine the irrep @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath0 non - fully degenerate operators are @xmath94 and label the basis @xmath95 .",
    "explicitly:@xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the heaviside function on @xmath98 .",
    "thus there is @xmath0 idf , the same as the number of kinematical df .",
    "any hamiltonian can be diagonalized by an @xmath1 transformation and thus expressed as a combination of the casimir operators .",
    "thus any system with @xmath85 dynamical algebra is quantum integrable .",
    "the classical model for any quantum system with @xmath85 dynamical algebra is also completely integrable when considered as a classical hamiltonian system .",
    "elementary excitation operators are given by : @xmath99 where @xmath46 is the lowest weight vector of the @xmath91 representation , and @xmath1 coherent states are obtained as @xmath100 .",
    "coherent states are parameterized by the coset space @xmath101 which is isomorphic to @xmath88 .",
    "we see that all states are @xmath1 coherent states .",
    "thus , all states are equally and minimally quantum .",
    "the @xmath0 degrees of freedom are disentangled in any state .",
    "it should be noticed that since any state is @xmath85 coherent state the dynamics of the quantum system on @xmath88 and its classical model with the hamiltonian function @xmath102 on the phase space @xmath101 are identical ( and integrable ) for any hamiltonian ( please see for example @xcite .",
    "a special case of the systems with @xmath103 dynamical group is a qubit with @xmath104 dynamical algebra and the hilbert space with two complex dimensions .",

    "hamiltonian which is a linear expression of the @xmath110 generators is quantum integrable according to the definition ( with the proper choice of the quantization axes ) . a system with a hamiltonian that is a nonlinear expression of the generators is quantum nonintegrable , and as we shall see generates @xmath4-entanglement .",

    "provided the accepted definitions of quantum nonintegrability and @xmath4-entanglement we see that nonintegrable hamiltonians generate @xmath4-entanglement in the systems with one idf .",

    "as was already pointed out , the orbits in the hilbert space of the quantum integrable and nonintegrable cases belong in the same class from the point of view of the qualitative theory of dynamical systems , i.e. they are regular orbits .    because of the definition of the dynamical group as @xmath123 the system is considered as composed of two spins .",
    "coherent states are products of the coherent states of each of the spins and are thus disentangled . if @xmath128 or @xmath129 then there are product states that are products of noncoherent states of the component spins",

    "<S> yz , 05.45.mt    quantum theory is generally considered as the fundamental theory of physics . </S>",
    "<S> this means , among other things , that all physical notions that appear in it should be derived within the quantum theory itself , that is without reference to another independent physical theory . in this note </S>",
    "<S> we shall analyze the notion of an independent degree of freedom ( idf ) as it might be ( and has been ) defined in quantum mechanics , and study two important issues , seemingly unrelated , where the definition of quantum mechanical degrees of freedom is relevant . </S>",
    "<S> i.e. the definition of entanglement and of quantum integrability .    </S>",
    "<S> idf are relevant to the question of how much a state of a given system possess the properties that are typically quantum </S>",
    "<S> . total level of quantum fluctuations with respect to all basic observables , which depend on the idf of the quantum system , should be considered as a measure of quantumness of a given quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that a pure state of a fixed quantum system considered in differently defined sets of idf might show different properties of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> maximally entangled state in one set of coordinates corresponding to one set of degrees of freedom might be disentangled and posses minimal quantumness in another set of degrees of freedom .    </S>",
    "<S> another property of a quantum system which depends on the definition of idf is the notion of quantum integrability . </S>",
    "<S> a unique notion of the quantum dynamical integrability is not commonly accepted as it is in the classical case , and , like entanglement , depends on the definition of the idf . </S>",
    "<S> a choice of idf is possible such that any quantum system with a finite dimensional hilbert space can be considered as a completely integrable hamiltonian dynamical system . </S>",
    "<S> however , similar in the spirit and the meaning of the classical integrability is the notion of dynamical symmetry based on the systems dynamical algebra , which is well defined in quantum as well as in the classical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of dynamical symmetry , and more generally the dynamical group , in quantum mechanics implies a well defined notion of independent dynamical degrees of freedom , and can be used to define quantum integrability . </S>",
    "<S> although quantum systems never display qualitative properties of classical nonintegrable systems a quantum system which is quantum non - integrable according to this definition has well defined classical model which shows typical qualitative properties of chaotic classical hamiltonian systems . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the classical model of a quantum integrable system is completely integrable in the classical sense .    </S>",
    "<S> the idf are determined by the need to describe the interactions within the system and possible interactions of the considered system and the environment which serve to describe what can be measured in the given circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the system is composed of two spatially separated subsystems than it is `` natural for local observers '' to choose the independent degrees of freedom to respect the spacial separation . </S>",
    "<S> if the spacial separation leads also to dynamical independence of the two subsystems then an arbitrary separable state of such a system remains separable in the course of the evolution , and this is an objective property of the system . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the two sets of entangled and separable states are dynamically separated . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it could be argued that the choice of idf in this case appears natural precisely because of the dynamical separation between entangled and separable states . </S>",
    "<S> this suggest that in general the quantum definition of idf that displays the objective property of entanglement is related to the quantum dynamical properties of the system i.e. to the quantum integrability </S>",
    "<S> .    our goal will be to study the importance of the definition of idf for the relation between entanglement and quantum integrability for a quantum dynamical system in general . </S>",
    "<S> we shall see that in quantum mechanics the choice of degrees of freedom dictated by the dynamical structure of the system that is by the dynamical algebra and its particular subalgebras should represent also an appropriate choice of idf for an objective and generalized treatment of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> discussion of the systems dynamical group will lead to a notion of degrees of freedom and the discussion of dynamical symmetry to the notion of quantum non - integrability and entanglement generating systems . in a nutshell , our conclusion will be that the dynamical group of the system determines its degrees of freedom and the dynamical symmetry determines if the quantum system is capable of generating entanglement .    in the next section we shall first recapitulate general definitions of independent degrees of freedom , quantum integrability and the generalized entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> we then establish the relation between the quantum integrability and generalized entanglement and discuss , in section 3 , several examples . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical algebraic definition of idf and quantum integrability have been introduced in references @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is no generally accepted notion of genuinely quantum integrability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the definition of what is a quantum chaotic system is even less unique @xcite . the most common approach , at least for lattice spin systems , </S>",
    "<S> is based on the generalization of the notion of thermodynamical integrability of classical spin systems@xcite , and is different from the one accepted here . </S>",
    "<S> according to the thermodynamic integrability a quantum system is called integrable if it is exactly solvable by application of the generalized bethe ansatz or by the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum system is nonintegrable if it has not been integrated by such methods . in </S>",
    "<S> what sense a quantum nonintegrable system can be considered as quantum chaotic is a matter of a debate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some quantum systems of finite number of spins whose thermodynamical limit is quantum nonintegrable , show the same spectral properties as the systems obtained by quantization of classically chaotic systems , and , furthermore , display the mixing properties that lead to expected equilibrium and non - equilibrium thermodynamical behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of bipartite and multipartite entanglement in such quantum chaotic systems has been studied and compared with the entanglement dynamics in quantum integrable systems @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite the notion of quantum integrability and nonintegrability understood in the thermodynamic sense is very different from the notion of dynamical symmetry and quantum integrability as was introduced in @xcite and as it shall be used here .    </S>",
