    "our analysis of the stability of cn disks reveals the following trends .    *",

    "the stellar potential is also important for the stability of the cn disk . * for srsic - law galaxies ,",
    "the cn disk is more stable in higher mass galaxies because they tend to have more centrally concentrated stellar density profiles . *",
    "the existence of a central stellar core in luminous ellipticals makes the cn disk unstable , especially around the break radius .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec - meth ] , the central surface brightness profiles for relatively low - mass galaxies ( @xmath96 @xmath1 ) are generally described by the srsic law , with the trend of higher mass galaxies tending to have larger @xmath36 .",
    "points ( 1)(3 ) above indicate that cn disks in lower mass galaxies are more unstable . on the other hand ,",
    "relatively high - mass galaxies ( @xmath97 ) tend to have stellar density profiles that contain a central core , which leads to a more unstable cn disk compared to the srsic law . on the other hand ,",
    "since such systems also have more massive bhs , cn disks in higher mass galaxies are kept stable , especially within the break radius .",
    "these trends can explain the observational trends outlined in section [ sec - intro ] . because cn disks are more stable in more luminous ellipticals , this provides a natural explanation for central star formation to be curtailed in giant ellipticals , whereas less luminous ellipticals apparently have host nuclear star formation with greater ease , even though cold ism in the form of dusty nuclear disks are observed to be just as prevalent in both environments .",
    "it is also worth stressing that , as seen in figure [ fig - sigdm8r25 ] , the cn disk can remain stable even if the density of the disk is more than 100 @xmath1 pc@xmath98 within 100 pc .",
    "this is because the bh stabilizes the cn disk in the central region , as seen in figure [ fig - qvalm8r25 ] .",

    "* ) in cn disks that otherwise have high densities .    at a fixed total stellar mass for the host galaxy , galaxies with higher @xmath36 srsic law have more stable cn disks , while the core - srsic law leads to more unstable cn disks than the srsic law",
    "therefore , the frequency of central star formation activity should depend on both the central stellar density profile as well as the bh mass .",

    "it is noteworthy that _ all _ of the co - measured cn disks have systematically larger disk masses than the dust - measured systems , suggesting that at least part of the discrepancy may be due to systematic errors in the estimated gas masses .",
    "both sets of observations require a conversion factor to arrive at a gas mass . in the case of the co observations ,",
    "a standard galactic co - to - h@xmath104 conversion factor was adopted .",
    "the co - to - h@xmath104 conversion factor , however , may be systematically lower in regions of high metallicity @xcite , as is the case in the central regions of massive galaxies , a suggestion supported by radiative transfer calculations in numerical simulations of cn disks @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , then the gas masses from @xcite are overestimated .",
    "a similar caveat applies to the gas masses estimated from the dust extinction , which assume a galactic gas - to - dust mass ratio @xcite .",
    "however , dust mass estimated from optical extinction should be considered as lower limit to the true dust masses @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite show that the dust masses derived from the far - infrared emission are roughly an order of magnitude higher than those estimated from optical extinction alone .",
    "they argue that the optical extinction may underestimate the dust mass by about factor of 2 due to the assumption that the dust is in front of the stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* who claim that this effect is more significant ) .",
    "@xcite also discuss that the discrepancy in the estimated dust mass is mainly due to the presence of diffusely distributed dust , which can not be seen as optical extinction .",
    "we note , however , that such a diffuse component is unlikely to be present as a rotating disk , as it is more likely to be supported by velocity dispersion . in any case",
    ", it seems plausible that the gas masses derived from the optical dust features may be an underestimate of the true gas mass , thereby narrowing the disagreement with the co - based masses . until more accurate gas masses are available , it is difficult to draw more quantitative comparisons between our model predictions and observations . to see",
    "if there is any sign of ongoing star formation in the sample of galaxies shown in figure 5 , we have done a careful search of the literature to inspect published optical spectra @xcite . galaxies with ongoing star formation",
    "show optical emission - line ratios that are readily distinguishable from other sources of ionization ( e.g. , active galactic nuclei ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among all the objects ,",
    "only ngc 4526 has a spectral classification consistent with stellar photoionization @xcite .",
    "the rest either have no star formation ( 14 galaxies ) or have insufficient spectral information to tell ( 5 galaxies ) .",
    "although ngc 4526 , which is highlighted in figure [ fig - gqmin ] , is in the stable ( @xmath105 ) region , interestingly , ngc 4526 has one of the most unstable cn disks among the _",
    "hst_-measured sample .",
    "also , none of the co - measured cn disks , which are located in the unstable region in figure [ fig - gqmin ] , show a clear indication of star formation .",
    "although this contradicts with our prediction , because of the above - mentioned ambiguities in the estimates of the gas masses from the observations , it is difficult to conclude if these galaxies require additional process to explain their suppression of star formation .",
    "it is clear from inspection of figure  [ fig - gqmin ] that once the mass of the cn disk becomes high enough , the disk will inevitably become unstable for star formation , one of the consequences of which may be to aid gas fueling to the agn @xcite .",
    "this type of situation is likely to be realized in the aftermath of a gas - rich major merger , whereby the large amount of the gas dissipated toward the center can generate a high - mass cn disk .",
    "high - resolution millimeter observations of luminous infrared galaxies indeed suggest that systems with larger central gas surface densities tend to either form stars with greater efficiency or have a higher probability of hosting an agn @xcite .    finally , we speculate that star formation induced in an unstable cn disk may be directly related to the formation of kinematically decoupled cores ( kdcs ) that are often seen in the centers of early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the central stellar disk that many power - law ellipticals seem to have @xcite .",
    "one of the intriguing clues regarding the origin of kdcs is that large cores are always old @xcite .",
    "if kdcs are a by - product of unstable cn disks , then large kdcs require large , massive cn disks , which probably can only be formed through major , gas - rich mergers , which are most prevalent at earlier epochs .",

    "<S> such a cored stellar density profile leads to more unstable cn disks than the power - law stellar density profile characteristic of less massive galaxies . </S>",

    "<S> our results demonstrate that the gravitational potentials of _ both _ the central bh and the stellar component should be taken into account when studying the properties of cn disks , as their stability is sensitive to both the bh mass and the stellar density profile . </S>",
