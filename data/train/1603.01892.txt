    "one of the hallmarks of a topological phase of matter is a marked dependence of the number of groundstates on the topology of the system . superconductors share this property , in that the groundstate degeneracy of a superconductor shaped like a manifold @xmath0 is a topological invariant of @xmath0 .",
    "however , topological groundstate degeneracy in superconductors with non - zero net magnetic flux is less well - understood .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we address this gap and compute the groundstates of two - dimensional superconductors with background monopoles .",
    "we find a continuum of superconducting groundstates , as well as other exotic physics .",
    "+ our model of the superconductor is the standard bcs model with the @xmath1-wave pairing hypothesis , in the ultra - dilute , infinite volume limit , in which the bcs energy density on @xmath0 becomes well - approximated by the gross - pitaevskii energy density .",
    "the set of physically - distinct superconducting groundstates is then the moduli space of gauge - inequivalent solutions to the gross - pitaevskii equations on a complex line bundle @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we use the variational principle of quantum mechanics to extract the superconducting groundstates .",
    "+ in this variational method , the difficulty of extracting the superconducting groundstates with monopoles translates into the difficulty of solving the gp equations on a nontrivial line bundle @xmath3 . despite this difficulty , we surmount it using powerful mathematical methods , inspired in part by geometric analysis ( taubes s phd thesis _ vortices and monopoles _ ) , and in part by condensed matter physics ( oshikawa and senthil in _ fractionalization , topological order , and quasiparticle statistics _ ) .",
    "to even discuss the bcs model on a nontrivial surface requires some work . a great way to start is to construct the hilbert spaces involved , as well as the local field algebra of observables , in a manifestly covariant way .",
    "+     +   the superconductor @xmath0 . in this case , @xmath4 ( source : google images ) .",
    "we begin with the observation that the space of states for a fermion on @xmath0 is _ unitarily _ isomorphic to the hilbert - space @xmath5 of square - integrable cross - sections of some hermitian line bundle @xmath3 over @xmath0 .",
    "+ now , if we fix a surface @xmath0 , there are many line bundles @xmath6 .",
    "in fact a standard result of the theory of characteristic classes is that these are classified modulo diffeomorphisms by their first chern class . by the chern - weil homorphism ,",
    "this integer is precisely the number of magnetic flux quanta penetrating the surface : @xmath7 @xmath8 is also commonly known as the magnetic monopole number , but this is only a convenient device for physical intuition ; there is no `` outside '' of the surface .",
    "+ we can then ask : what line bundle should we consider for our model ? in this paper , we allow all possibilities : each fixed @xmath8 defines a unique line bundle @xmath3 up to diffeomorphisms .",
    "thus each topological sector contains a distinct smooth structure and ultimately a full - fledged bcs model .",
    "the construction goes like this : having fixed an integer @xmath8 , we then define an electromagnetic gauge field @xmath9 , inducing a holomorphic structure on @xmath3 . in the corresponding yang - mills theory ,",
    "the dynamical variable is the _ holomorphic structure _ of @xmath3 : as the gauge field evolves through time , the holomorphic structure of @xmath3 may vary through time .",
    "in contrast , the topological structure of @xmath3 is static , i.e. * magnetic charge is conserved*. + having fixed a topological structure , we can then construct the corresponding many - body hilbert space @xmath10 for the fermions as the exterior algebra on the hilbert space of square - integrable cross - sections of @xmath3 ( here , @xmath8 indexes fermion , not monopole , number ) : @xmath11 the observable algebra @xmath12 can then also be constructed , as the union of local algebras @xmath13 generated by fermonic creation and annihilation operators of cross - sections supported on open subsets @xmath14 of @xmath0 .      this and the next subsection will both closely model the discussions in .",
    "the many - fermion model on @xmath0 that we wish to study is a standard bcs model with @xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "the groundstate postulates of bcs theory with @xmath1-wave pairing can be stated succinctly as @xmath15 where the @xmath1-wave * bcs variational ansatz * @xmath16 is defined to be the unique quasi - free state determined by the following two - point functions on the fermonic field algebra @xmath12 : @xmath17 the final relevant assumption of the bcs model with @xmath1-wave pairing is that the expectation value of the energy of the bcs variational ansatz ( i.e. the * bcs energy functional * ) , is assumed to satisfy ( see ): @xmath18 here , @xmath19 denotes the standard yang - mills energy density of @xmath20 , which is the covariant derivative on @xmath3 specified by the gauge field ( here , it is acting on the second argument of @xmath21 ) .",
    "having defined the energy functional , the variational principle yields the set of groundstates for the bcs model : @xmath22 however , because there is no additional structure on @xmath3 that allows an observer to distinguish between isometric gauges , we must physically identify two groundstates which are related by a gauge transformation .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to modding - out @xmath23 by the action of the gauge group .",
    "+ accordingly , we define the * moduli space * of @xmath1-wave superconducting groundstates on a surface @xmath0 by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the action of gauge transformations on the triple @xmath26 induced by gauge transformations of the fermonic field algebra @xmath12 . because we have now modded - out by gauge transformations",
    ", @xmath27 is equal to the set of physically - distinguishable groundstates of a bcs model on @xmath0 .",
    "following , we introduce an ultra - dilute infinite - volume limit @xmath28 , in which the expected number of fermions goes to zero as @xmath29 , and the volume of the surface approaches infinity as @xmath30 . based on the results of",
    ", we expect @xmath31 to be well - approximated by the * gross - pitaevskii energy functional * @xmath32 i.e. the energy density depends only on an order parameter @xmath33 for paired electrons .",
    "this is expected , because the superconducting state , according to the bcs theory , is a bec of paired electrons , and the gross - pitaevskii functional is well - known to describe the energy of a bec , as proven by erdos et .",
    "al . in . here , @xmath34 i.e.",
    ", the covariant derivative on the cooper - pairs is constructed via second - quantization of the single - particle covariant derivative .",
    "therefore , in this ultra - dilute , infinite - volume limit , the set of groundstates for the @xmath1-wave bcs model is , effectively @xmath35 again , because there is no structure on @xmath3 that allows an observer to distinguish between isometric gauges , we must mod - out the action of the gauge group on @xmath36 . + accordingly , the * moduli space * of solutions to the gp equations on a surface @xmath0 modulo gauge transformations is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath25 denotes the action of gauge transformations on the pair @xmath38 induced by gauge transformations of the fermonic field algebra @xmath12 . because we have now modded - out by gauge transformations",
    ", @xmath39 is equal to the set of physically - distinguishable groundstates of a bcs model on @xmath0 , in this ultra - dilute , infinite - volume limit .",
    "here , we consider the case @xmath40 , where the analysis will reproduce n. read and green s fascinating result in , namely , that a bcs model on a riemann surface has ground states exactly corresponding to the spin structures on that surface , without referring to details of the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "all of this power comes at the price that our results are only relevant in the ultra - dilute , infinite - volume limit .",
    "+ to analyze the gp functional in the @xmath40 sector , we break it up into three parts . also , to simplify the analysis",
    ", we will set the single - particle potential @xmath41 to be a constant .",
    "in this case , we can write @xmath42 the reason why we are decomposing the action in this way is because , in the topologically - trivial sector , all three terms can be simultaneously minimized : to minimize @xmath43 and @xmath44 , it suffices to have , separately , @xmath45 where the first condition only makes sense on a trivial line bundle .",
    "since these equations are simultaneously satisfiable , the corresponding space of solutions modulo gauge transformations is exactly @xmath46 .",
    "+     + : _ a superconducting groundstate on a surface @xmath0 ( here @xmath47 ) , in the absence of monopoles , is labeled by @xmath48 bits , one for each generator of the fundamental group of the surface ( source : google images ) .",
    "_    we now do as stated , that is , compute the solutions to the system of three minimization conditions ( a.1 ) .",
    "the first condition implies that @xmath9 is flat .",
    "the second condition implies that the value of the order parameter at any given point is the parallel transport of its value from anywhere else : @xmath49 since @xmath50 is a global section , this implies that the holonomy of the connection @xmath51 is always trivial inside the superconducting region .",
    "since we have , for every closed loop @xmath52 , @xmath53 we have that the holonomy of @xmath9 squares to one , and therefore lies in the subgroup @xmath54 .",
    "we now can state the following theorem : +    we have an isomorphism of sets @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the holonomy @xmath57-subspace of the moduli space of flat connections on @xmath0 modulo gauge transformations .",
    "_ every groundstate of the superconductor , by the analysis above , corresponds to an equivalence class @xmath58 $ ] , where @xmath9 is a flat gauge field with holonomy @xmath57 , and we have , for @xmath59 , @xmath60 therefore , we are essentially claiming that it suffices to represent each groundstate by the gauge - equivalence class of @xmath9 , and forget about the order parameter .",
    "+ this is because , to specify @xmath50 , all we need is the value @xmath61 of the order parameter at a single point @xmath62 in the superconducting region ; to obtain the value anywhere else , we parallel transport via @xmath51 : @xmath63 therefore , by specifying a value @xmath61 of the order parameter at a fixed point @xmath64 , we can recover the groundstate which represents any given gauge field .",
    "+ once we choose such a value @xmath61 along with representatives @xmath65 from each equivalence class of flat gauge fields , we find that this defines a map of sets @xmath66 which factors onto a isomorphism @xmath67 , upon modding - out by gauge transformations on both sides .",
    "@xmath68     + by our theorem , the groundstates of a superconductor are in one - to - one correspondence with the holonomy @xmath57-subspace of the moduli space of flat connections on @xmath0 modulo gauge transformations . by the universal coefficient theorem , @xmath69 and",
    "therefore we have an exact solution @xmath70 note that , in deriving this formula , we did not have to assume that @xmath0 was two - dimensional .",
    "for the special case of a riemann surface , however , we can go further : the rank - one cohomology of a riemann surface with coefficients in @xmath71 is the direct product of @xmath48 copies of @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the genus .",
    "therefore , @xmath73 therefore , we have , as desired , reproduced the results of demonstrating the one - to - one correspondence of groundstates of the bcs model to spin structures on @xmath0 , without referring to the microscopic details of the bcs hamiltonian .",
    ".the groundstate degeneracy of a monopole - free bcs model on a surface @xmath0 exhibits a marked dependence on the topology of @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "now we allow ourselves to be in a topologically nontrivial sector , and allow @xmath75 . the calculation of the moduli space of groundstates of the bcs model will be vastly more difficult in this case , and so we focus on the special case @xmath74 , where the gp energy functional coincides with the yang - mills - higgs action functional .",
    "roughly , @xmath76 this will allow us to efficiently extract a large subspace of @xmath77 , i.e. , a large class of superconducting groundstates , in spite of the complications caused by the net magnetic flux through the surface .",
    "we now introduce the * yang - mills - higgs action * , at level @xmath78 , on a complex line bundle @xmath6 , by the following expression : @xmath79 the moduli space of solutions modulo gauge transformations to the corresponding yang - mills - higgs equations in the topological sector @xmath80 was computed by bradlow in 1990 to be , in the limit @xmath81 , isomorphic to the @xmath8-fold symmetric product of the surface with itself : @xmath82 therefore , if we treated the yang - mills - higgs action as an energy density @xmath83 for a quantum many - body hamiltonian , i.e. , identical to the situation with @xmath84 , then the groundstate sector for this hamiltonian would be isomorphic to the @xmath8-particle component of the bosonic fock space on @xmath0 , i.e. each groundstate @xmath85 would admit a labelling by vortex locations:@xmath86      we now take advantage of the miraculous coincidence between the yang - mills - higgs functional at @xmath87 and the superconducting energy functional at @xmath74 to extract crucial information about the superconducting groundstates in the presence of monopoles .",
    "the relation is most succinctly stated as @xmath88 where the constant of proportionality is positive .",
    "therefore , if we take any equivalence class @xmath58 $ ] in the yang - mills - higgs moduli space , then , automatically , @xmath89 is an equivalence class of superconducting groundstates : @xmath90\\in \\mathcal m_{gp}^{1/4}(\\sigma).\\tag{a.3}\\ ] ] furthermore , if @xmath91\\neq [ { \\left| \\psi , a \\right>}]\\in \\mathcal m^{-8u}_{ymh}(\\sigma)$ ] are distinct in the yang - mills - higgs moduli space , then the corresponding superconducting groundstates constructed via ( a.3 ) are also distinct in the gross - pitaevski moduli space : @xmath92\\neq [ { \\left| \\psi , a/2 \\right>}]\\in   \\mathcal m_{gp}^{1/4}(\\sigma).\\ ] ] to see this , suppose to the contrary that @xmath92= [ { \\left| \\psi , a/2 \\right>}]\\in   \\mathcal m_{gp}^{1/4}(\\sigma).\\ ] ] then , in particular , this means that there exists a gauge transformation @xmath93 , such that , in a local trivialization @xmath94 therefore , letting @xmath95 be the gauge transformation @xmath93 composed with itself twice , then , in that same trivialization , @xmath96 therefore , since this analysis holds in each local trivialization , we have @xmath91=[{\\left| \\psi , a \\right>}]\\in \\mathcal m^{-8u}_{ymh}(\\sigma)$ ] , contradicting our original assumption that the two classes were unequal in the yang - mills - higgs moduli space .",
    "therefore , in total , we have constructed an injection of moduli spaces @xmath97 sending @xmath98\\mapsto [ |\\psi , a/2\\rangle ] $ ] , that allows us to view @xmath99 as a subset of @xmath100 .",
    "this gives us a lower - bound on the number of superconducting groundstates on @xmath0 in this nontrivial setting , where it is relatively difficult to obtain information .     .",
    "_ the refined construction : each equivalence class of solutions to the yang - mills - higgs equations splits into a distinct family of gauge - inequivalent solutions to the @xmath74 gp equations .",
    "_    in particular , the set of superconducting groundstates in the image of this injection , by bradlow s calculation earlier , is isomorphic to the @xmath8-fold symmetric product of the surface with itself : @xmath101 therefore , identical to the situation earlier , each superconducting groundstate @xmath102 in this subset admits a labelling by vortex locations : @xmath103          we now focus on a concrete example , to illuminate the relevant characteristics of the classification program we have carried out for two - dimensional bcs theory .",
    "therefore , we will solve the @xmath74 gp equations on the bundle @xmath113 , the associated line bundle to the hopf bundle @xmath114 . +     + _ * figure 4*. the hopf fibration ( source : google images ) . _",
    "+    since the associated bundle @xmath115 has chern number @xmath116 , and since @xmath117 , our technique extracts a class of groundstates @xmath118 in one - to - one correspondence with the surface @xmath119 itself .",
    "physically , this makes sense : since there is only one vortex , each superconducting groundstate is labelled by the location @xmath120 of that vortex .",
    "furthermore , all loops on a two - dimensional sphere can be contracted to a point , and so a flat gauge field has trivial holomomy ; so there is no additional ground state degeneracy ( gsd ) that we can deduce from fractionalization arguments . +",
    "the physics of superconductivity has been incredibly successful in inspiring revolutionary technologies such as squids , superconducting qubits , mri , and more . in this paper , we examined the topological groundstate degeneracy ( gsd ) of two - dimensional superconductors with non - zero net magnetic flux . in the already well - known case @xmath40 ,",
    "we reproduced the results of read and green in by explicitly identifying superconducting groundstates on a surface @xmath0 with the set of spin structures on that surface : @xmath121 in dimension two and @xmath75 , we witnessed new physics , including a continuum of superconducting groundstates , parametrized both by continuous vortex locations as well as discrete flux values around non - contractible loops on the surface .",
    "this was proven by our identification of a large class of solutions to the gross - pitaevskii equations at @xmath74 : @xmath122 once again , study of superconductivity over the past century has inspired new technologies , and we hope that , by pushing the boundaries of superconducting physics , the results will be no different , inspiring new technological paradigms .",
