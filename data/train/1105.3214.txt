    "robotic telescopes that acquire large datasets of astronomical images have introduced the need for methods and tools that can automatically analyze astronomical images and turn these data into knowledge .",
    "one of the tasks that require automation is the morphological analysis of galaxy images , which is an essential tool in sky surveys such as sdss @xcite or the future lsst @xcite , des @xcite , and the space - based tauvex galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "the first attempts to automatically classify galaxies were made by @xcite , and followed by the work of @xcite , who tried to classify elliptical galaxies by their internal structures .",
    "other studies used central concentration as an indicator that can determine the position of a galaxy on the hubble sequence @xcite , or the central concentration and asymmetry of galaxian light @xcite .",
    "another approach to galaxy image analysis is the parametric approach , used by tools such as gim2d @xcite and galfit @xcite , which can be wrapped by the galapagos script to improve its performance @xcite .",
    "later attempts to perform automatic morphological classification of galaxies include the gini coefficient method @xcite , and the cas method @xcite .",
    "however , the efficacy of these methods for real - life galaxy morphological classification has been criticized @xcite , and did not provide solid useful tools that can be used for galaxy morphological analysis @xcite .",
    "this led to the contention that practical classification of large datasets of galaxy images should be carried out by humans @xcite .",
    "a significant improvement was introduced by the application of machine learning approaches to the task of galaxy classification .",
    "@xcite used support vector machine for galaxy classification and probability density estimation , and applied the method to sdss dr7 @xcite .",
    "@xcite achieved good results by utilizing an artificial neural network .",
    "recent studies also showed significant improvement in the accuracy of automatic classification of galaxy images used by the galaxy zoo project , demonstrating accuracy of @xmath090% for the classification of the three primary morphological types ( spiral , elliptical , and edge - on ) , and @xmath095% accuracy when classifying spiral and elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "while showing good classification accuracy , these machine learning methods require a step of training , and normally do not provide useful information about the galaxy other than its morphological type . here",
    "we describe ganalyzer , which is a fast and easy to use model - based tool that measures the ellipticity and spirality of galaxies . in section  [ method ]",
    "the image analysis method is described , section  [ results ] discusses the performance evaluation and experimental results , and section  [ ganalyzer ] provides an introduction to using the ganalyzer command line utility .",
    "the first step of ganalyzer is detecting the objects in the image and extracting basic information about each object such as the center , ellipticity and position angle , as done by object detection methods such as sextractor @xcite .",
    "this goal is achieved by first separating the objects from the background by applying the otsu threshold @xcite , which is a widely used method for determining the graylevel threshold that separates between the foreground and the background pixels .",
    "figure  [ otsu_image ] shows an original galaxy image taken from _",
    "galaxy zoo _ and the foreground galaxy pixels detected using the otsu method .",
    "once foreground pixels are separated from the background pixels , all eight - connected objects that their surface size is larger than 1000 pixels are detected .",
    "detecting objects in the image allows ganalyzer to analyze images in which more than one object is present , and the 1000 threshold is used to reject small foreground objects ( surface size smaller than 1000 pixels ) that are present in the image but are too small to provide an interpretable morphological structure .",
    "after the objects are detected , each object is assigned with its pixel mass center , computed as the image coordinates @xmath1 such that the number of pixels @xmath2 where @xmath3 equals the number of pixels @xmath2 where @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath5 coordinate is computed such that the number of pixels where @xmath6 equals the number of pixels such that @xmath7 .",
    "then , the galaxy center @xmath8 is determined as the center of the 5@xmath95 shifted window that has the highest median value and its distance from the pixel mass center of the object is smaller than @xmath10 , where _ s _ is the surface size of the object in pixels .",
    "this simple and fast method accurately detected the center of the galaxy in all 525 galaxy images tested in this study .",
    "after the galaxy center is found , the radius of the galaxy is determined by the maximal distance between the object center and any foreground pixel .",
    "the major axis of the galaxy is determined as the longest possible line that passes through the center , and the minor axis is determined by the length of the line that passes through the center in 90@xmath11 to the major axis .",
    "the ellipticity of the galaxy is then determined by the minor axis of the galaxy divided by its major axis .",
    "in addition to the ellipticity , ganalyzer also computes the position angle of the galaxy .",
    "the basic element used in this study for measuring spirality is the radial intensity plot .",
    "the radial intensity plot is a 360@xmath935 image , such that the value of the pixel @xmath2 is the median value of the 5@xmath95 windows around the pixel at image coordinates @xmath12 in the galaxy image , where @xmath13 is the polar angle ( in degrees ) and r is a radial distance .",
    "intuitively , the radial intensity plot is an image of the radial intensities at different distances from the galaxy center .",
    "each horizontal line in the radial intensity plot is then smoothed using a median filter with a span of 50 pixels .",
    "if the radius of the galaxy is greater than 100 pixels , the radial intensity plot is computed after downscaling the object such that the radius is set to 100 .",
    "this practice helps to analyze high - resolution images in which star forming regions or substructures in the spirals can affect the detection of the arms .",
    "figure  [ radial ] shows the original galaxy image and a transformation of the radial intensity plot such that the y axis is the intensity and the x axis is the polar angle .",
    "as the figure shows , in an image of a spiral galaxy the peaks are expected to shift due to the spirality of the arms , while if the galaxy is not spiral the peaks are expected to align in a near - straight line .    to use the shift of the peaks in the radial intensity plot for detecting spirality ,",
    "the peaks are first detected using an automatic peak detection algorithm @xcite , with the parameters @xmath14=10 , _",
    "threshold_=0.05 , and _",
    "iterations_=1 , as described in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ peaks ] shows the peaks detected in the galaxy images of figure  [ radial ] , such that the radial distance is between 0.4r to 0.75r , where _ r _ is the radius of the galaxy described in section  [ prop ] .",
    "once the peaks are detected , a linear regression is used to determine the slope of each of the two groups of peaks that have the highest number of detected peaks .",
    "for instance , in the galaxies of figure  [ peaks ] the peaks of the spiral galaxy are organized in two lines with slopes of @xmath00.74 and @xmath00.81 , while the slopes of the peaks of the elliptical galaxy are @xmath00.22 and @xmath00.1 .",
    "the slopes of the arm reflect the level of spirality of the examined galaxy . to avoid the effect of local variations that can lead to peaks such as stars or satellite galaxies , only groups that have 20 or more peaks",
    "are included in the analysis .",
    "if just one arm is detected , a galaxy is considered spiral if the absolute value of the slope of the arm is greater than 0.35 . if more than one arm is detected , the analysis is based on the two arms with the largest number of peaks .",
    "if both arms have slopes greater than 0.5 , or if one of the arms has a slope greater than 0.7 , then the galaxy is considered by ganalyzer as spiral .",
    "if the standard deviation of one of the arms is smaller than 2 , then a slope greater than 0.35 in this arm will also be considered by ganalyzer as an indication of a spiral galaxy .",
    "these rules were determined experimentally by comparing the analysis of the slopes to the manual galaxy classification performed by the author using the galaxy image datasets used in @xcite .",
    "the slope of the arm of a spiral galaxy can peak at different distances from the center in different galaxies .",
    "therefore , the peaks are detected in four different ranges of distances from the center : 0.1r to 0.45r , 0.2r to 0.55r , 0.3r to 0.65r , and 0.4r to 0.75r , such that _ r _ is the radius of the galaxy described in section  [ prop ] .",
    "if the slopes of the peaks detected in any of these ranges meet the criteria described above , then the galaxy is determined to be spiral .",
    "ganalyzer also detects the presence of bars , which is performed by analyzing the vertical lines in the radial intensity plot generated for distances 0.5r to 1.0r .",
    "while the intensity is normally expected to decrease when moving away from the galaxy center , if bars exist it is expected that the intensities will increase at around the distance of the bar from the center .",
    "therefore , if 50% or more of the vertical lines of the radial intensity plot show an intensity increase the galaxy is determined to have bars .",
    "if no spirality is detected , the galaxy is determined to be edge - on if the ellipticity described in section  [ prop ] is greater than 0.8 .",
    "otherwise , the galaxy is considered elliptical .",
    "it should be noted that ganalyzer outputs the ellipticity value , which can be more informative than the distinct morphological class .",
    "ganalyzer was tested using a dataset of small galaxy images taken from the _ galaxy zoo _ web site @xcite , and was previously used for developing a machine learning - based galaxy image classification method @xcite .",
    "the first dataset contains 225 images classified manually by the author as spiral , 225 images classified as elliptical , and 75 galaxy images classified as edge - on galaxies .",
    "all images were color images , and did not contain _ galaxy zoo _",
    "monochrome images that were collected for the _ galaxy zoo _ bias study @xcite .",
    "the dataset is available for free download at http://vfacstaff.ltu.edu/lshamir/downloads/ganalyzer/galaxyimages.zip .    among the 525 galaxy images ,",
    "466 were classified correctly , which is @xmath089% of accuracy where the gold standard is the manual classification performed by the author .",
    "table  [ confusion_matrix ] shows the confusion matrix of the classification .",
    ".confusion matrix of the galaxy classification [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ elliptical_spiral ] shows spiral galaxies that were classified incorrectly .",
    "as the table shows , these galaxies were clearly classified incorrectly by ganalyzer .",
    "while the radial intensity plots show that some of the peaks shift as the distance from the galaxy center changes , in some cases the peaks are not always detected correctly , and improving the peak detection used in this study @xcite might improve the performance of the galaxy classification .",
    "another limitation of ganalyzer is that the analysis is dependent on the arms , and therefore if the resolution of the image is too low and the arms can not be seen the galaxy might not be analyzed correctly .    to test ganalyzer with a larger set of galaxy images ,",
    "another experiment was performed with a galaxy dataset of 6209 galaxy images classified as spiral and 2316 galaxy images classified as elliptical by galaxy zoo participants @xcite .",
    "the experiment showed that ganalyzer was in agreement with the manual classification in @xmath086% of the cases .",
    "an important advantage of ganalyzer is its low computational complexity , which allows it to process very many images using relatively modest computing resources .",
    "for instance , the galaxy image dataset of 525 images used in this study was processed in @xmath0170 seconds using a single core of intel core - i7 quad core processor .",
    "therefore , by using eight cores a standard desktop computer can process @xmath010,000,000 images in just five days .",
    "the ganalyzer tool is a simple windows command - line utility that receives a path to a galaxy image file , and prints the analysis results to the standard output .",
    "for instance , the following command line returns the morphological class , as well as the ellipticity , position angle , surface size ( pixels ) , radius , image coordinates of the center , and the slopes of the shifts of the peaks detected in the image  galaxy.tif \" .",
    "c:\\@xmath15 ganalyzer c:\\path\\to\\galaxy.tif for instance , the output of ganalyzer when applied on the spiral galaxy of figure  [ radial ] is : object 1 : center : ( 53,62 ) surface size ( pixels ) : 3989 radius ( pixels ) : 45 ellipticity : 0.295 position angle : 143 degrees slopes : 0.74 ( stderr 1.28 ) 0.81 ( stderr 0.80 ) galaxy type : spiral    currently , the supported file formats are tiff , jpg , ppm , and bmp . in cases where the source images are in the fits format , the images can be converted to lossless 8 or 16 bit tiff format before being analyzed by ganalyzer .",
    "since ganalyzer is used as a command line utility , it can be easily embedded into other applications and serve as a component in an astronomical pipeline processing system .    to allow a more informative analysis of the galaxy image",
    ", ganalyzer can also output the radial intensity plots and the peaks .",
    "this can be done by using the  -i \" switch .",
    "for instance , the following command line can be used to generate the radial intensity plot and its transformation described in figure  [ radial ] , as well as the detected peaks as described in figure  [ peaks ] .",
    "c:\\@xmath15 ganalyzer -i c:\\path\\to\\galaxy.tif    when the  i \" switch is used , these images are created in the working directory , such that irp.tiff and irp_radial.tiff are the radial intensity plot and the transformation described in figure  [ radial ] , and irp_peaks.tiff is the image of the detected peaks as described in figure  [ peaks ] .",
    "the increasing availability of robotic telescopes that acquire large datasets of galaxy images has introduced the need for automatic methods for galaxy image analysis that can be practically used for analyzing these datasets .",
    "ganalyzer is a fast and simple software tool that uses the radial intensity plots of galaxy images to measure the spirality and ellipticity of galaxies and classify galaxy images into three morphological classes of spiral , elliptical , and edge - on .",
    "ganalyzer is based on measuring the spirality of galaxies , and might not be optimal for detecting morphological features that are not directly related to the ellipticity and spirality .",
    "therefore , ganalyzer might not excel in detecting galaxies that their unique morphology is not based on spirality such as s0 , mergers , or peculiar galaxies .",
    "the tool is used as a command - line utility , so that it can be embedded into other programs and serve as a component in a more comprehensive system of astronomical image pipeline processing .",
    "since ganalyzer is relatively quick , it can be practically used for analyzing very large datasets containing millions of galaxy images .",
    "ganalyzer can be downloaded freely at : http://vfacstaff.ltu.edu/lshamir/downloads/ganalyzer or from the astrophysics source code library at http://ascl.net .",
