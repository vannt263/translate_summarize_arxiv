    "recently , the systems of particles interacting with discrete potentials gained much attention from the scientific community .",
    "such an increased interest to this class of model systems is associated primarely with their ability to mimic the bulk properties of variety of complex fluid systems , like associating fluids , colloids , cluster particles etc .",
    "the discrete hard - core potentials composed of an attractive square well and a repulsive square barrier were shown to induce the liquid - liquid phase transition in  a single - component model fluid glaser2007,franzese2001gmg , rzysko2008jcp , cervantes2007jcp .",
    "similar phase transitions take place in the real substances like water , carbon and phosphorus .",
    "moreover , the effective potentials with square - well plus square - barrier components may be used to mimic colloidal particles interactions , which according to the dlvo theory are characterized by a long - range repulsive barrier and one or possibly two attractive wells . finally , inhomogeneous fluids with descrete repulsive and attractive interaction potentials represent another intriquing area of research because they often serve as a benchmark to study a variety of interesting problems such as interfacial phenomena , surface adsorption , wetting , capillary condensation , etc .",
    "the most suitable method to handle these systems seems to be the classical density - functional theoriy ( dft ) .",
    "there are several versions of the dft derived usualy from either weighted density approximation or perturbation expansions .",
    "recently , tang and wu @xcite have proposed a new dft in which fundamental measure theory is combined with the so - called first - order mean - spherical approximation ( fmsa ) .",
    "its implementation requires knowledge of the thermodynamics and the direct correlation function of  the model bulk fluid . in comparison with alternative approaches ,",
    "dft / fmsa possesses a number of advantages due to the both accuracy and simplicity of the fmsa solution . in combination with the dft ,",
    "the fmsa was already applied to study lennard - jones @xcite , yukawa @xcite , sutherlad @xcite fluid systems . regarding the systems with descrete potentials , quite recently @xcite the dft",
    "/ fmsa approach has been applied to study the structural properties of the square - well ( sw ) fluid model defined by the pair interaction potential ,    @xmath3    with a unit hard - core diameter , the attractive strength @xmath4 and the well width parameter @xmath5 ; the fmsa solution for the direct correlation function ( dcf ) of this model system has been obtained in a separate study @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that dft / fmsa gives good performance for entire considered range of attraction parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that fmsa is linear with respect to the interaction potential allows one to use linear combinations of the different potential functions for which fmsa solution is known . regarding the case of the sw model",
    "this means that one can employ the linear combinations of the square wells ( @xmath6 ) and/or square barriers ( @xmath7 ) in order to form all variety of  the discrete potential models .",
    "unfortunately , majority of potential applications of the discrete sw - based potential models ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath8have the range of interaction that exceeds one particle diameter , that requires to consider @xmath9 in eq.(1 ) .",
    "this means that existing fmsa solution obtained by tang @xcite is not sufficient to have fmsa be applied in the studies of the complex discrete potential models .",
    "the aim of present work is to extend the recent fmsa solution@xcite for the sw model fluid with @xmath5 to the case of the sw fluids with @xmath10 .",
    "obtaining of a such fmsa solution for the attractive sw model is crucial for the future application of both the fmsa as well as the dft / fmsa to the systems with a combined ( attractive sw plus repulsive sb ) discrete potential .",
    "this will be shown in a forthcoming paper [ ] .",
    "the actual paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "ii we outline the necessary details of the fmsa solution for sw potential with @xmath11  the fmsa results for the direct and pair correlation function will be presented and compared against computer simulation data in section iii .",
    "we conclude the paper in section iv .",
    "the general fmsa formalism , developed by tang and lu , is presented in their paper tang1993nso .",
    "these authors solved the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation , @xmath12for a one - component system of particles / moleculs of a number density @xmath13  by employing the perturbative expansion for the total and direct correlation functions , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , over the pair interaction energy parameter @xmath16 @xmath17where the subscript @xmath18 denotes the contribution of a hard - sphere ( hs ) reference system while the subscript @xmath19 stands for the first - order perturbation term .",

    "the general solution of the first order oz equation can be obtained .",
    "the fourier transform of the first order contribution to the total correlation function @xmath14 reads , @xmath21where    @xmath22    and @xmath23 is the baxter hard - sphere factorization function with a laplace transform given by @xmath24with @xmath25 , and @xmath26the function @xmath27 in eq .",
