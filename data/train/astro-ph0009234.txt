    "the two methods yield consistent results within the errors .",

    "multiple velocity components may well be present ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but our spectra have insufficient signal to noise for us to detect secondary velocity components in an unbiased way",
    ". instead we search for bulk counterrotation between the gas and stars .",
    "our approach highlights the most extreme counterrotators , but the number of counterrotators we find should be considered a lower limit .",
    "we adopt the simplest possible definition of a counterrotator : a galaxy in which the observed gas and stellar rotation curves show opposite sign .",
    "again , this approach yields a lower limit , because our stellar curves have varying spatial extent , and some galaxies may contain undetected velocity reversals at large radii , similar to the reversal we see in ngc  3011 ( figure  [ fg : indiv ] ) .",
    "furthermore , not all apparent counterrotators actually contain gas and stars in coplanar counterrotating disks .",
    "an inclined gas disk may also create an apparent counterrotation signature , and this scenario provides a plausible interpretation for one of our galaxies ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "however , we note that the processes that produce inclined disks and those that produce coplanar counterrotating disks are probably similar , and the former may even evolve into the latter , so our interpretation does not rest critically on this distinction",
    ".    we estimate the confidence level for each counterrotation detection by attempting to rule out a model in which the stars simply do not rotate .",
    "using a standard @xmath16 minimization algorithm , we fit a straight line to the stellar rotation curve to determine its slope and the error on the slope . in most cases",
    "the stellar rc may be reasonably ( if crudely ) approximated by a straight line , except in ngc 3011 , which shows a mix of corotation and counterrotation ( see  3.1 ) . in this case",
    "we fit just the counterrotating points .",
    "the slope divided by the error on the slope constitutes the confidence level of our claim of _ counter_rotation , as opposed to zero rotation . for two galaxies that we label counterrotators ,",
    "the data differ from a zero rotation model by only 23@xmath17 , so such a model can not be completely ruled out . on the other hand , three s0 s and one",
    "i m galaxy rotate so little that we can not definitely say that they are _ not _ counterrotators .",
    "we return to this point in  3.2.150 @xmath10 and despite a tight match between the major axis position angle and the observed pa s .",
    "there is a faint suggestion that better data might show counterrotation at radii @xmath18 kpc , but the present data do not permit such a claim .",
    "this is the only such case in our 67 galaxy sample .",
    "ngc  4795 exists in a field of multiple small companions , and it may be accreting one of them . ]",
    "in our sample of 67 galaxies , we identify five likely gas - stellar counterrotators : 2 s0 s , 2 e s , and 1 i m .",
    "figure  [ fg : indiv ] shows their rotation curves and images , and tables 14 summarize their properties .",
    "figure  [ fg : minor ] shows the available minor axis data .",
    "we note that the type i m counterrotator found here , a23542@xmath151633 , may be the first known gas - stellar counterrotator in this morphology class , although the confidence level of the detection is not decisive ( by fitting the slope as described in  2.3 , we rule out a stellar non - rotation model at 2.2@xmath17 confidence , and rule out equal - amplitude corotation at 3.2@xmath17 confidence ) .",
    "@xcite lists several counterrotators as  irr , \" but these are peculiar rather than magellanic irregular galaxies .",
    "the only previous observation of any form of counterrotation in a magellanic irregular galaxy appears to be that of @xcite , who have reported two counterrotating hi gas components in ngc  4449 .",
    "we should of course consider the possibility that a23542@xmath151633 might display misleading velocity reversals due to gas infall along the elongated structure on its major axis .",
    "however the gas rc does not show large velocity reversals .",
    "the small velocity shifts near @xmath3@xmath192 kpc may reflect infall , especially given the fluctuations seen in the minor axis rc ( figure  [ fg : minor ] ) , but these shifts do not dominate the major axis kinematics .    in the s0 a11332@xmath153536 ,",
    "the apparent counterrotation may be caused by an inclined gas disk .",
    "consistent with a misaligned disk , the minor axis gas shows velocity amplitude comparable to the major axis gas , and while the minor axis gas appears to rotate faster than the stars , the major axis gas appears to rotate slower than the stars ( see figures  [ fg : indiv ] &  [ fg : minor ] .",
    "this galaxy also has a small bar along its minor axis . @xcite and @xcite point out that radial motions along a bar may sometimes create a false impression of counterrotation in one - dimensional data ; however , in this case the orientation of the bar makes confusion due to non - circular motions unlikely .    in ngc  3011",
    ", the stellar rotation pattern changes with radius .",
    "stars within @xmath30.5 kpc rotate very slowly ( if at all ) in the same sense as the gas , while stars at larger radii counterrotate with 3@xmath17 confidence .",
    "this combination suggests that the inner stars may consist of two oppositely rotating stellar populations , one population having formed more recently from infalling gas .",
    "further data would be required to test this hypothesis .",
    "figure  [ fg : tmb ] shows the distribution of gas - stellar counterrotators in morphology and luminosity , within the context of our 67 galaxy sample as well as the larger nfgs .",
    "the bulk counterrotation frequency for the 67 galaxy sample is @xmath37% .",
    "however , this number includes e / s0 s , early type spirals , and later type galaxies in differing proportions (  2.1 ) and would likely be lower in a properly weighted sample .    for e / s0 s taken alone",
    ", gas - stellar counterrotators comprise 4 out of 17 emission line galaxies in the nfgs , which we survey completely .",
    "this result yields a frequency of @xmath2 ( errors are 68%confidence limits from binomial distribution statistics ) . if we exclude the 3 s0 s that show almost no rotation (  2.3 ) , then the statistics are 4 in 14 , or @xmath20 . in sharp contrast",
    ", we find no clear cases of counterrotation among 38 sa ",
    "sbc spirals , although one sa does show another form of kinematic decoupling ( ngc 4795 , see note 1 ) .",
    "this rate of non - detection implies that , at 95% confidence , no more than @xmath21 of such early type spirals are bulk counterrotators . for types",
    "sc and later , we can make no statistical conclusions due to inadequate sampling .",
    "the strong clustering of the nfgs counterrotators in the early type morphology region of figure  [ fg : tmb ] probably arises from two factors .",
    "first , if counterrotation originates from galaxy mergers ( as discussed in  3.3 ) , then early type morphologies are a natural corollary .",
    "second , if galaxies of all types were to accrete retrograde gas with equal probability , then this gas would survive longer in relatively gas - poor early type galaxies , where collisions with existing gas and loss of angular momentum are less important .",
    "figure  [ fg : tmb ] also illustrates the tendency of our gas - stellar counterrotators to have low luminosity ( sub - l@xmath22 ) .",
    "this result may simply reflect the fact that low luminosity galaxies , especially early types , are more likely to be gas rich , while brighter galaxies often have too little gas for us to detect , and so are not part of our sample .",
    "previous studies of gas - stellar counterrotation have focused on samples restricted by morphology . @xcite and",
    "@xcite analyze the detailed kinematics of a sample of 23 isolated , unbarred sa galaxies .",
    "their sample contains 4 bulk gas - stellar counterrotators , suggesting that we should see @xmath312 examples among our 8 sa s .",
    "in fact , we see none , but our results are consistent within the small number statistics .",
    "also , we do find one sa with kinematically decoupled gas ( ngc  4795 , see note 1 ) , apparently non - rotating even at radii @xmath33 kpc .",
    "the sense of gas rotation in the central @xmath31 kpc of this galaxy is not well determined .    in two surveys of s0 s with extended gas emission , @xcite and @xcite",
    "independently obtain gas - stellar counterrotation frequencies of @xmath32025% for samples of 15 and 17 objects respectively . combining the two surveys",
    "yields a frequency of @xmath3@xmath23 for a total sample of 29 galaxies , with 3 objects common to both samples .",
    "both surveys were drawn from bright galaxy catalogs and contain objects in the range m@xmath0 @xmath121 to @xmath118 , with a median of @xmath3@xmath119 .    by comparison , the 14 s0 s with extended gas emission in the nfgs span luminosities from m@xmath24 to @xmath114.7 , with a median of @xmath3@xmath117 .",
    "only @xmath330% of these nfgs galaxies overlap the luminosity range of the two bright galaxy surveys ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nonetheless , our gas - stellar counterrotation statistics for these 14 s0 s agree with @xcite and @xcite within the errors : @xmath25 , or @xmath26 if we exclude the 3 s0 s that show almost no rotation (  2.3 ) .",
    "such agreement suggests the possibility that similar mechanisms form emission line s0 s over a wide range of physical scales  at least m@xmath0 @xmath121 to @xmath117 , the range within which s0 gas - stellar counterrotators have now been detected .",
    "however , we should point out that the low luminosity `` s0 '' population is heterogeneous , and may include objects with very different formation histories .",
    "we assigned the s0 classification purely based on morphology , so it applies to all nfgs galaxies with the visual appearance of a two - part bulge+disk structure with minimal spiral structure . at low luminosities , this category reveals at least two subclasses : mostly smooth galaxies , and knotty or otherwise peculiar galaxies , typically with centers bluer than their outer parts ( often labelled blue compact dwarfs ) .",
    "it is possible that only the smoother subclass forms a continuum with higher luminosity s0 s in terms of formation history , or alternatively that the more peculiar objects are simply at an earlier stage of evolution .",
    "our two s0 counterrotators have most in common with the smoother subclass , although a11332@xmath153536 does have a small central bar and tiny spiral arms .",
    "the two most plausible formation mechanisms for gas - stellar counterrotators are late - stage gas accretion and galaxy mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "secular evolution can not easily explain large quantities of chemically enriched counterrotating gas ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we do not separately discuss inclined gas disks here , since they are likely to be closely related to counterrotating disks .",
    "late - stage gas accretion mechanisms include acquisition of a large hi cloud , transfer of gas during a close encounter , and infall of nearby gas stimulated by a flyby of another galaxy .",
    "assuming that the counterrotators hi gas rotates in the same peculiar sense as their ionized gas , accretion of a single hi cloud can not easily explain these galaxies substantial hi gas masses ( @xmath3@xmath27 @xmath28 , table  3 ) .",
    "if the accreted hi cloud were similar to the high velocity clouds found near the milky way , then it would have an hi mass of @xmath3@xmath29 @xmath28 , at least an order of magnitude too small @xcite .",
    "note that this estimate assumes that the high velocity clouds are local group objects at @xmath31 mpc distances  if the clouds are closer to the milky way , then their hi masses are even smaller @xcite .",
    "the likelihood of either companion gas transfer or infall triggered by a flyby encounter is harder to evaluate , especially since the responsible galaxy may have left the neighborhood or may be too faint to be included in a galaxy catalog .",
    "we can only say that we see no strong evidence in favor of this scenario .",
    "based on a search of the updated zwicky catalog @xcite within 600 kpc and 600 km s@xmath30 of each counterrotator , only one counterrotator has a neighbor within 150 kpc projected on the sky ( ngc  5173 , see table  4 ) .",
    "however , @xcite have mapped this galaxy in detail in hi , and they see no evidence for hi flow from the companion . the lack of obviously interacting companions near our counterrotators is consistent with expectations based on the analogy between counterrotation and polar rings .",
    "@xcite compare the local environments of @xmath350 apparent polar ring galaxies with those of a control sample , and they find no statistical difference between the two groups in the number of close neighbors of comparable luminosity within @xmath3600 kpc .",
    "of course , the fact that 4 of our 5 counterrotators have e / s0 morphology hints that they probably exist in regions of high local galaxy density , which density calculations confirm ( courtesy n. grogin , see figure  [ fg : dens ] ) , although the environments are only moderately dense .",
    "this observation is consistent with either flyby or merger formation scenarios .",
    "mergers provide a simple alternative to late - stage gas accretion mechanisms . in this case",
    "the companion is gone , so no enhanced abundance of close neighbors is expected .",
    "the scale of the merger might range from satellite accretion to a major merger of comparably sized galaxies ( though not necessarily comparably gas rich ) .",
    "even mergers with dwarf galaxies could easily yield the hi gas masses observed , which are similar to the hi masses of late type dwarfs in the nfgs ( computed from catalog hi fluxes , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed in  3.2 , the tendency for bulk counterrotators to have early type morphologies may mean that both morphology and counterrotation have a common origin , in which case the merger would have been substantial .",
    "on the other hand , minor satellite accretion could also explain the primarily early type morphologies of the counterrotators , if galaxies of all types accreted small neighbors , but the retrograde gas did not survive in gas rich later types .",
    "we expect that retrograde gas will shock with existing prograde gas and either form stars immediately or lose angular momentum , creating enhanced infall and central star formation @xcite .    for the round elliptical ngc  5173 ,",
    "either scenario is plausible .",
    "@xcite propose that this galaxy may have formed when a gas poor elliptical accreted a gas rich satellite ; such an event could explain the galaxy s apparently small dust to gas mass ratio @xcite .",
    "alternatively , simulations show that major mergers between gas rich disk galaxies can also produce counterrotating gas in an elliptical @xcite .",
    "for the two s0 counterrotators and the disky elliptical ngc  7360 , minor mergers present a likely intermediate option .",
    "simulations by @xcite and @xcite show that minor mergers produce disky remnants , and when dissipation and star formation are included , gas rich minor mergers can produce gas poor s0 s @xcite .",
    "@xcite reject the minor merger hypothesis for low luminosity e / s0 s because observations of these galaxies show significantly greater rotational support than is seen in 3:1 disk merger simulation remnants .",
    "however , none of the simulations for which @xmath31 information is available include the physics of dissipation , infall , and star formation , which are clearly critical ingredients in the formation of a disk from gas rich progenitors .    in our view ,",
    "minor or even gas - rich major mergers provide a very plausible formation mechanism for disky low luminosity e / s0 s , if one considers that the likely progenitors bear little resemblance to the model galaxies currently used in merger simulations . @xcite",
    "have shown that bulgeless disk galaxy mergers evolve very differently from bulge + disk galaxy mergers , but no one has yet modelled the complexities of a dwarf - dwarf merger .",
    "for example , the progenitors might be gas rich dwarfs with extended filamentary hi envelopes that continue to fall into the remnant late in the merger process .",
    "the gas dynamics of small gravitational potential wells may also be important : many small early types in the nfgs display broad emission line wings , possibly related to mass outflows .    given the steeply rising numbers of galaxies at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function @xcite , gas rich dwarf - dwarf mergers are inevitable , and some of the remnants of such mergers may well look like s0 s , or spirals embedded in s0 envelopes .",
    "the existence of very low luminosity s0 s , and counterrotators as faint as m@xmath0 @xmath117 , contrasts with the sharp decrease in early type spirals fainter than m@xmath0 @xmath118 and the corresponding increase in the number of late type dwarfs ( figure  [ fg : tmb ] , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the faint population of the nfgs contains a number of possible `` proto - s0 s ''  galaxies with very blue centers and outer envelopes reminiscent of early types @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are variously typed late or early depending on the surface brightness of the envelope and the degree of inner structure . in the nomenclature of the dwarf galaxy literature ,",
    "some would be known as blue compact dwarfs , a class of galaxies showing many of the expected characteristics of merger remnants @xcite .    of course",
    ", some dwarf merger remnants probably just turn into bigger , brighter late type dwarfs .",
    "for example , although the i m counterrotator a23542@xmath151633 appears to be actively evolving , with ongoing infall (  3.1 ) and moderately strong star formation ( table  3 ) , it does not much resemble a proto - s0 , but appears more like a proto - sd .",
    "if the counterrotators are merger remnants , one might expect them to show signatures of enhanced past or present star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "the e / s0 counterrotators smooth morphologies ( with small perturbations , see table  1 ) suggest that for these four galaxies , the merger probably took place at least @xmath31 gyr ago @xcite . in keeping with this view ,",
    "these galaxies show moderate h@xmath32 absorption equivalent widths ( @xmath313  , r.  jansen , private communication ) , consistent with starburst ages greater than @xmath31.5 gyr for solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the one irregular counterrotator shows stronger h@xmath32 absorption ( @xmath356  , subject to some uncertainty in the emission correction ) , suggesting a more recent / ongoing starburst .",
    "we note also that for the two faint s0 s , the nominal gas consumption timescale is relatively short ( @xmath32 gyr uncorrected for recycling , see table  3 ) , possibly implying rapid evolution",
    ". in fact , both of these galaxies are markarian galaxies and have starburst nuclei @xcite .",
    "we have searched for bulk gas - stellar counterrotation in 67 galaxies spanning a broad range of morphologies and luminosities within the @xmath3200 galaxy nfgs sample .",
    "this sample permits statistical conclusions for types e  sbc , and includes a few later types as well .",
    "however , our detections represent a lower limit to the true rate of counterrotation , because the data do not permit separation of multiple kinematic components and do not rule out counterrotation beyond the radial extent of the observations .",
    "we detect 5 gas - stellar counterrotators , generally of early type and low luminosity .",
    "these galaxies include 2 e s , 2 s0 s , no spirals , and 1 magellanic irregular .",
    "the i m galaxy counterrotates with 2.2@xmath17 confidence , and if confirmed represents the first known example of gas - stellar counterrotation in a magellanic irregular .",
    "one of the s0 counterrotators probably contains an inclined gas disk rather than coplanar counterrotation ; we assume that these phenomena are closely related in our interpretation .",
    "statistically , we conclude that @xmath2 of e / s0 s with extended emission are bulk gas - stellar counterrotators , or @xmath20 if we exclude 3 s0 s that display very little rotation .",
    "in contrast , our non - detection of spiral counterrotators implies that no more than 8% of sa  sbc spirals are bulk counterrotators , at 95% confidence .",
    "this morphological dependence of counterrotation frequency may arise from two effects .",
    "first , if galaxy interactions and mergers are responsible for creating the counterrotators , then the same mechanisms will tend to produce early type morphologies .",
    "second , even small - scale retrograde gas accretion events that do not strongly reshape morphology will be easier to detect in e / s0 s , because bright spiral galaxies will typically have sufficient prograde gas to dynamically neutralize the infall .",
    "sa galaxies may represent a transitional case . although we detect no sa counterrotators , our sample is small ( only 8 galaxies ) and includes one galaxy in which the sign of the central gas rotation is uncertain .",
    "the same galaxy shows clear gas - stellar decoupling at larger radii , where its gas displays zero apparent rotation , despite large stellar velocities .",
    "@xcite finds that @xmath31520% of bright , unbarred sa s are bulk gas - stellar counterrotators .    for s0 s with extended gas emission , the frequency of gas - stellar counterrotation we derive agrees with the results of @xcite and @xcite , although the median luminosity of our sample is @xmath32 mag fainter ( m@xmath0 @xmath117 ) .",
    "the agreement suggests that similar mechanisms form this category of s0 s over a wide range of physical scales , at least @xmath33 .",
    "as noted by @xcite , every known counterrotator implies at least one corotator that formed by a similar process , and probably more due to effects that tend to erase the retrograde kinematic signature .",
    "therefore the @xmath325% bulk counterrotation rate for emission line e / s0 s implies that at least @xmath350% of e / s0 s with extended gas emission have experienced the evolutionary processes that produce gas - stellar counterrotation .    in examining the range of possible processes ,",
    "we conclude that galaxy mergers ( including satellite accretion ) provide the most plausible explanation for the counterrotators , especially given these galaxies significant hi masses and lack of obvious companions .",
    "however flyby or faint companion interactions remain a possibility .",
    "we note that the possible products of gas rich dwarf - dwarf mergers remain largely unexplored in detailed simulations , despite clear evidence for such mergers in the faint galaxy population , and we suggest that our s0 and i m dwarf counterrotators may be products of such mergers .",
