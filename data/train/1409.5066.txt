    "observations of the microwave background and large - scale structure can be used to measure a variety of cosmological parameters . with accurate measurements of the distance - redshift relation",
    ", we can also start to probe the nature of dark energy .",
    "one of the cleanest probes of this is the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) signal imprinted in the power spectrum of the large - scale clustering of galaxies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the scale of acoustic oscillations in the cmb has now been measured to 0.1%  @xcite , and large - scale galaxy surveys have now been able to measure bao and hence the baryon acoustic scale at lower redshift to approximately 1%  @xcite .",
    "a combination of these data gives a powerful probe of cosmological parameters , constraining both early and late - universe physics , geometry , and evolution .",
    "parameters which are subject to the geometric degeneracy ( such as dark energy , curvature , and light massive neutrinos ) when measured from the single source - plane cmb can be constrained much better using bao , and hence our current best knowledge of these and other parameters critically depends on a reliable physical interpretation of the baryon acoustic scale .",
    "the aim of this paper is to test to what level the standard proxy for the acoustic scale measured in the correlation function of galaxies is accurate , justifying the use of this approximation in extended cosmological models , for example in the analysis of bao measurements combined with planck  @xcite .",
    "our analysis is especially timely because the renewed interest in extended neutrino models as a possible way of partially reconciling some of the apparent conflicts between existing data in the @xmath0cdm model , and using cosmology to tightly constrain possible solutions to neutrino reactor anomalies  @xcite .",
    "models with additional relativistic degrees of freedom typically significantly modify the expansion history and evolution before recombination , and hence potentially significantly modifying the shape of the matter correlation function compared to the standard assumption of @xmath0cdm . if the simple acoustic scale approximation starts to break down , a more complete direct analysis of the correlation function data would likely be required .    in sec .",
    "[ baoscale ] we start by a review of the baryon acoustic scale , how it can be defined and related to measurements of galaxy clustering . sec .  [ method ] then describes how we test the acoustic scale approximation by comparing constraints obtained directly from the correlation function to those obtained using the approximation .",
    "we only aim to test the accuracy of theoretical modelling , and hence consider simplified and idealized data",
    ". this should be sufficient to test whether the single acoustic scale number is sufficient to accurately capture the parameter dependence of the shape of the correlation function when fit with a scaling parameter ( as in recent bao measurements ) .",
    "finally in sec .",
    "[ results ] we give results for various parameter variations of standard and extended cosmological models , and end with our conclusions .",
    "in the pre - recombination plasma , thomson scattering kept the photons and baryons coupled together .",
    "acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon fluid imprint the acoustic oscillations observed in the cmb power spectra , as well as a smaller acoustic oscillation in the distribution of the total matter density after recombination due to the oscillations imprinted in the baryon component .",
    "the distance that the photon - baryon acoustic wave can travel ( sound horizon ) at the time of photon decoupling defines the scale of acoustic oscillations seen in the cmb power spectra .",
    "since there are far more photons than baryons , after photon decoupling the photons continued to drag baryons with them slightly longer into the compton drag epoch .",
    "the sound horizon when the baryons stop being dragged around by the photons therefore roughly defines the baryon acoustic scale , which is slightly larger than the sound horizon seen in the cmb .    from a theoretical model , the baryon acoustic scale is usually defined as the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the redshift at which the baryon velocity decouples from the photons .",
    "the sound horizon can be calculated by integrating the speed of the photon - baryon fluid , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is given in terms of the baryon density @xmath6 and photon density @xmath7 by @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the conformal time .",
    "after @xmath3 the baryon perturbations stop undergoing acoustic oscillations and start to grow with the dark matter perturbations , but the process of decoupling is in reality gradual , so @xmath3 is defined to be an indicative central value where @xmath10 , where  @xcite @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the thomson optical depth from recombination ( without reionization ) and @xmath13 the conformal time today . for a given set of cosmological parameters , and model for the recombination history , @xmath14 can be calculated quickly numerically in terms of background quantities , and is a standard output of camb  @xcite . for standard cosmological parameters @xmath14 can be predicted quite accurately using approximate fitting functions  @xcite , however for precision measurements , and generality in extended models , we use a direct numerical calculation as in most recent analyses .",
    "observationally , the baryon acoustic scale is the comoving scale corresponding to the position of the peak of the density correlation function , which can ( indirectly ) be measured from observations of galaxy clustering .",
    "the full density correlation function can be predicted accurately using linear perturbation theory .",
    "however due to issues of bias , non - linearities and observational complications , it can not easily be measured directly in galaxy surveys .",
    "however the position of the peak of the correlation function is thought to be much more robust , and therefore a powerful probe of the underlying cosmological model  @xcite . in practice",
    ", comoving distances can not be observed directly ( only angular scales and redshifts ) , so the observed angular correlation function at redshift @xmath15 is related to the underlying comoving acoustic scale by the comoving angular diameter distance @xmath16 ( for perturbations orthogonal to the line of sight ) , and the hubble parameter @xmath17 ( for perturbations along the line of sight ) .",

    ", @xmath17 and @xmath21 can be calculated easily from a given cosmological model , so the observed scale of the peak in the correlation function measures the parameter combination @xmath22 ( and equivalently for the radial and transfer components if they are resolved separately ; we use this particular combination as a concrete example below ) .",
    "often @xmath14 is considered to be accurately known by fits to cmb observations , in which case most of the information is about the late - time geometry .",
    "however in models with extra relativistic degrees of freedom ( for example , sterile neutrinos ) , massive neutrinos , or other extensions of the @xmath23  model , @xmath14 can also vary , and it is important to account for the model dependence of both parts of the ratio  @xcite .",
    "an optimal analysis of galaxy clustering data would model the full shape dependence of the correlation function , marginalizing appropriately over uncertainties in the bias , non - linearities and observational systematics , and determine parameter constraints directly from the theoretically predicted density correlation function in different models .",
    "a ` bao - only ' measurement attempts to abstract from such an analysis a measured peak correlation scale which can then be used as a kind of radical data compression when comparing with theoretical models , which is simple to interpret independently of the underlying modelling assumptions .",
    "there is however considerable freedom in how precisely the scale of the peak of the correlation function is defined from observed galaxy data . to be specific",
    "we follow refs .",
    "@xcite , defining a scale parameter @xmath24 by fitting the galaxy data ( power spectrum or two - point correlation ) relative to some scaled fiducial cosmological prediction with the assumption that @xmath25 the proportionality constant is to be determined from the fiducial model .",
    "the fitting of the redshift - space two - point correlations @xmath26 s is done by minimizing @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a vector of the observed galaxy correlation function estimates for bins centred at @xmath29 , @xmath30 consists of the values of a fitting function at the bin centres , and @xmath31 is the covariance matrix that specifies the error model associated with @xmath28 .",
    "recent bao data analyses from the clustering of galaxies  @xcite put five parameters in the fitting function , chosen to be in the form of @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an appropriate fiducial template correlation function , @xmath34 is a constant that accounts for an overall bias , and @xmath35 the smoothly - varying @xmath36 function ( with three free parameters , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) accounts for the unknown overall shape of the galaxy correlation , and is intended to remove most of the dependence on the unknown scale - dependence of the bias and non - linear physics .",

    "previous cosmological analyses , including the main _ planck _  cosmological parameter analysis  @xcite , have assumed that the parameter dependence of @xmath14 accurately models the change in peak position as reported from the data via the @xmath24 scale parameter as defined above .",
    "although it is clearly qualitatively correct , with precision now reaching the sub - percent level , it is not immediately obvious to what level of accuracy this assumption is valid , and at what point a more detailed modelling of the change of correlation function shape will be required ; answering these questions is the purpose of this paper .",

    "measurements of the acoustic scale can be made at different redshifts , and the effective distance @xmath43 for each redshift bin around an effective redshift @xmath44 can easily be computed from eq .  .",
    "here we are not concerned by the late - time geometry dependence of the result , and instead focus on whether the parameters that affect the acoustic scale at recombination are being adequately modelled .",
    "we therefore focus on a single fiducial redshift , and expect our conclusions to be very independent of that assumption because the shape of the correlation function in comoving distance is nearly constant long after recombination when it is observed .",
