    "of course , this differential equation has to be understood in a distributional sense ( we refer to section  [ sec2 ] for some details ) .",
    "the aim of the present article is to solve two inverse spectral problems for this class of singular strings .",
    "first of all , for each such string with mass distribution @xmath4 there is an associated scalar spectral measure ( cf .",

    "* subsection  2.7 ) ) which belongs to the class @xmath7 of all ( positive ) discrete measures @xmath8 on @xmath9 for which the sum @xmath10 is finite . in section  [ secisp ]",
    "we will solve the corresponding inverse problem , that is , we show that the correspondence between mass distributions in @xmath1 and spectral measures in @xmath7 is one - to - one .",
    "moreover , we are also able to characterize those mass distributions which are finite near some endpoint in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding spectral measure",
    ". of course , the case of a regular left endpoint overlaps with krein s inverse spectral theory of strings on a half - axis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( up to the minor differences regarding heavy endpoints and boundary conditions ) . at this point ,",
    "let us also mention that generalizations to strings with singular left endpoints have already been considered in @xcite and some inverse spectral results have been obtained in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite considers the class of singular strings with the left endpoint being @xmath11 and the mass distribution satisfying a growth restriction there , which guarantees that the resolvents of the strings , restricted to a neighborhood of @xmath11 , are trace class ( cf .",
    "* subsection  2.7 ) ) .",
    "there , it has been shown that a corresponding spectral measure determines the mass distribution of such a singular string up to a possible shift .",
    "the proof of this result is very similar to ours , which also relies on a variant of de branges subspace ordering theorem @xcite .",
    "regarding the existence part of this inverse problem , it has been shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.1 ) that at least measures with a polynomial growth restriction arise as spectral measures of such singular strings .",
    "this result has been enhanced in @xcite , where the class of singular strings corresponding to this polynomial growth restriction of the spectral measure has been described explicitly in terms of a growth restriction of the mass distribution near @xmath11 .",
    "the present article shows that it is also possible to describe the set of spectral measures corresponding to the class of mass distributions with an additional growth restriction near the right endpoint ( which ensures the resolvents to be trace class ) .",
    "in contrast to the results in @xcite , @xcite , spectral measures from this class may indeed exhibit arbitrary growth .",
    "secondly , we will consider the inverse three - spectra problem for this class of strings . by the three ( dirichlet )",
    "spectra associated with a mass distribution @xmath4 ( and a fixed interior point @xmath12 ) we mean the spectra @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath13 is the spectrum of the whole string and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the spectra of the string restricted to @xmath16 , @xmath17 , respectively with an additional dirichlet boundary condition at the point @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding inverse problem has been treated for example in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for schrdinger operators ( corresponding to smooth strings ) and in @xcite for stieltjes strings ( that is , strings consisting of a finite number of point masses ) .",

    "moreover , if one of these sets is finite , then so has to be the other one with @xmath35 or @xmath36 and they either end with @xmath37 or with @xmath38 .",
    "alternatively , we could also define @xmath19 to consist of all triples @xmath39 of discrete subsets of @xmath9 such that for each @xmath40 we have @xmath41 if and only if @xmath42 and for which the function @xmath43 ( where the products are assumed to converge locally uniformly ) is a herglotz  nevanlinna function , i.e. , maps the upper complex half - plane into itself or is a real constant .",
    "the equivalence of these definitions follows essentially from the interlacing condition for ( necessarily simple ) zeros and poles of meromorphic herglotz  nevanlinna functions ; see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.1 ) .",
    "in contrast to the inverse problem from the spectral measure , there is no one - to - one correspondence between @xmath1 and @xmath19 , as already noticed in @xcite for schrdinger operators and in @xcite for stieltjes strings . nevertheless , the map @xmath44 turns out to be onto and we are able to describe all possible strings with the same three spectra in terms of additional spectral data .",
    "the proofs of our theorems rely on the corresponding results for stieltjes strings , discussed in @xcite , @xcite or less immediately applicable ( due to the difference regarding heavy endpoints and boundary conditions ) also in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in section  [ seccont ] we will prove some continuity results for the spectral quantities on isospectral sets of @xmath1 , which allow us to lift the results for stieltjes strings to our class of mass distributions .",
