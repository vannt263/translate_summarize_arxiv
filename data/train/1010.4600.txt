    "<S> we assume that each temperature domain is initially in local thermal equilibrium , then we switch on the interactions among the domains and calculate the nonequilibrium dynamics of spin density in @xmath25 .    the central quantity that characterizes sse is the spin current @xmath16 injected into @xmath25 ( in experiment pt ) , since it is proportional to the experimentally - detectable electric voltage via ishe [ eq .

    "<S> [ fig2_ssephonon ]  ( b ) , where the phonons feel the temperature difference between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and drag magnons through the magnon - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> since the nonequilibrium phonons affect the magnon dynamics , this process injects spin current into @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the important point is that the spin current @xmath63 injected in this process becomes proportional to the phonon lifetime @xmath64 as  @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 with the debye temperature @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is a nearly - temperature - independent coefficient .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite since @xmath64 in a high - purity specimen is known to increase steeply at low @xmath12 because of the rapid suppression of umklapp scattering ,  @xcite it leads to the drastic enhancement of the phonon - dragged sse . in our analysis , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath64 is extracted from the thermal conductivity data for y@xmath50fe@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite ( see the inset of fig .  [ fig3_ssephonon ] ) using  @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the phonon velocity , and @xmath72 is the phonon specific heat with the number of phonon modes @xmath73 . after getting the information on @xmath74 , we calculate the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath49 resulting from the phonon - dragged sse . </S>",
    "<S> the result , plotted in fig .  [ fig3_ssephonon ] ( the solid curve ) , shows an excellent description of the low-@xmath12 enhancement of sse .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite our analysis demonstrates that the phonon - drag mechanism is of crucial importance to understand sse below the room temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4_ssephonon ] our interpretation on the observation of sse that is unaccompanied by a global spin current ,  @xcite where the heat is carried by phonons through the nonmagnetic substrate while the spin is injected locally at the @xmath36 interface . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation is reinforced when we recall that the magnitude of the spin seebeck signal is enhanced with decreasing @xmath12 even well below the curie temperature , whose tendency is consistent with the phonon - drag mechanism as is seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3_ssephonon ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the fact that the experiment was done below the room temperature supports the the phonon - drag - based scenario , since the phonon - drag process becomes more effective at low @xmath12 as emphasized in the previous paragraph . </S>",
    "<S> all these considerations strongly support that the sse experiment for gamnas can be interpreted in terms of the phonon - drag mechanism , and results in a prediction that the substrate condition affects the observed signal . </S>",
