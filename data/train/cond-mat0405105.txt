    "anisotropic systems differ from isotropic ones in that their response to an applied force or field depends not only on the magnitude but also the orientation of these influences@xcite . for electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) or x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) ,",
    "a good example is the carbon 1s core electron excitation in graphite@xcite .",
    "excitation into the unoccupied states of @xmath0-symmetry is only allowed if the applied field is along the direction normal to the graphite sheet ( defined to be the local z - axis ) .",
    "excitation into the unoccupied state of @xmath1-symmetry can only occur if the applied field lies in the plane of the graphite sheet ( defined to be the local x - y plane ) . as a consequence , the intensities of these two excitations depend on the specimen orientation in general .",
    "graphite is an uniaxial system which is the simplest example of anisotropic systems .",
    "anisotropic response is a gift to the experimentalists as it offers further insight into the electronic excitation process@xcite or it can be used to determine the orientation of molecules@xcite or internal magnetic field@xcite . in this paper , we focus on the complexity it brings to the eels measurement which now also depends on the precise orientation of the specimen and ways to overcome it .",
    "concerning electronic excitation , many important systems show anisotropy such as familiar layered materials like graphite and bn@xcite , non - central symmetric semiconducting compounds such as gan@xcite , superconductors such as ybacuo@xcite and mgb@xmath2 @xcite . some nanostructures such as nanotubes and nanoonions",
    "can be considered as roll - up versions of layered materials , so the local anisotropy also changes with position inside the nanostructured material@xcite .",
    "in addition , shape or local field effects will turn an isotropic transition into an anisotropic one@xcite .",
    "this presents difficulty for quantitative spectral analysis , particularly from localized areas using eels , a powerful method for electronic structural characterization , particularly at nanoscale .",
    "for example , real changes in the electronic structure may not be easily distinguished from variations due to mere specimen rotation or probe displacement along a curved basal plane .",
    "so there is a need to find an experimental approach in which specimen orientation is no longer effective on the spectra .",
    "a related problem also exists in other forms of spectroscopy .",
    "for instance , in solid state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , the signal depends strongly on the specimen orientation and more useful information is obtained after the discovery of the magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance ( mas - nmr ) method@xcite .",
    "another example in xas is the so - called magic angle condition used to eliminate the orientation effect for anisotropic systems@xcite . in eels ,",
    "the applied field responsible for electronic excitation is parallel to the direction of the momentum transfer vector * q * of the incident electron in the inelastic scattering@xcite . as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , by virtue of electron scattering , the direction of * q * is a function of the electron scattering angle @xmath3 , being parallel to the incident electron beam at the zero scattering angle and changing towards a direction perpendicular to the beam with the increasing scattering angle .    in the angular integrated energy - loss spectroscopy with a centered circular aperture , a standard eels collection condition particularly for high spatial resolution and high signal to noise ratio ,",
    "electronic excitations of different momentum transfer * q * are recorded .",
    "excitations induced by the applied fields over a range of directions are summed@xcite .",
    "menon and yuan@xcite showed both experimentally and theoretically there also exists a magic angle ( ma ) at which the eels signal is independent of specimen orientation .",
    "their theory predicts the magic angle for a parallel beam illumination ( ma@xmath4 ) to be @xmath5 .",
    "there @xmath6 is the characteristic angle which has a approximate form @xmath7@xmath8=2e / e@xmath9 ( the more accurate definition is given by ritchie and howie@xcite ) and with e being the energy - loss and e@xmath9 the incident energy of the fast electrons .",
    "the derivation is for uniaxial , graphite - like , systems .",
    "a number of other studies have also analyzed this problem again , mostly for uniaxial anisotropic systems .",
    "however , controversy as to the precise magic angle condition persists .",
    "for example , zhu et al.@xcite used an approximate method to arrive at a value of ma@xmath4 of about 1.8@xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "paxton et al.@xcite used a different approach to arrive at ma@xmath4=1.36 @xmath7@xmath8 . compounding this state of confusion in magic angle prediction",
    "is the report of daniels et al.@xcite who found experimentally that ma@xmath4=2@xmath7@xmath8 and also provided a theoretical justification for their result .",
    "souche et al.@xcite presented a more through theoretical analysis of the anisotropic electron energy - loss spectroscopy for graphite - like materials , taking into account the convergence beam effect .",
    "their result for the parallel beam illumination is in agreement with the prediction of menon and yuan@xcite .",
    "in addition , apart from attempts by paxton , all theoretical analysis has been confined to maeels in uniaxial systems , the applicability of the magic angle concept in more complex anisotropic systems is an unexplored area .    in order to make use of maeels ,",
    "it is vital to understand the discrepancies between the various theories , particularly given that all models make the same basic assumptions , i.e. the electron beam scattering being kinetic , non - relativistic , and obeying the dipole approximation . in the process",
    ", we have demonstrated that the magic angle is a general effect which can occur in all sorts of anisotropic systems , be they crystalline , amorphous , single phase or nanostructured and applies to anisotropic transition whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic ( for example , shape - effect induced ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present a through analysis of electron energy - loss spectroscopy in anisotropic systems in order to establish a solid foundation for maeels in the core - electron excitation region and we derive a general definition for magic angle conditions . in section iii , we show that the spectral information obtained at the magic angle is equivalent to orientationally averaged spectroscopy . from this geometrical interpretation , we can understand the different approaches used in maeels analysis reported in the literature and explain the reasons for discrepancies in the prediction of magic angle conditions . in section iv ,",
    "we have provided more explicit maeels expressions for applications in specific material systems .",
    "in particular , we concentrated on more commonly encountered uniaxial and biaxial systems and establish the connection between maeels and other forms of magic angle spectroscopies such as xas and mas - nmr .",
    "there are two ways to study the electronic excitation in anisotropic systems : the macroscopic approach is to use the dielectric function and the microscopic approach to calculate directly the quantum mechanical transition matrix element .",
    "both approaches have been reported in the literature@xcite and physically they should yield the same result . to facilitate comparison of these reports , we will make our derivation using both approaches .",
    "it is known that the quantum mechanical approach can reveal the microscopic physics involved , but because of the need for accurate wave functions , it does not always yield useful experimental results . on the other hand ,",
    "the dielectric approach is a phenomenological description of materials response that can be measured accurately , even though the microscopic origin of the electronic transitions may be obscured@xcite .",
    "here we start with the dielectric approach where the calculation is relatively straightforward , because the information required is not the detailed excitation form of but the overall effect in terms of the response to a perturbation deserved by the relation@xcite : @xmath10 where * d * , the electric displacement , is related to the electric field * e * by the well - known @xmath11 the dielectric function of the material system .",
    "@xmath11 is a metric tensor@xcite , defined in terms of a reference frame where the orthogonal principle axes are aligned with the major symmetry directions of the physical system . for convenience",
    ", we have defined this reference frame as the sample frame ( x , y , z ) .",
    "the imaginary parts of ( -1/@xmath12 ) is known as the energy - loss function@xcite , providing a complete description of the response of the medium through which the fast electron is travelling . the double differential cross section used to estimate the intensity of eels in an anisotropic system",
    "can be expressed as@xcite : @xmath13 where _ m@xmath14 _ the mass of the fast electron and * q * is the momentum transfer vector of the fast electrons in the inelastic scattering process ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) , _ n _ the number of atoms per unit volume of the material ,",
    "_ a@xmath15 _ the bohr atomic radius , _ h _ the plank constant and q@xmath16 the projection of * q * in the sample frame . note the components of the dielectric function are assumed not to be a function of * q * , and this assumption corresponds to the dipole approximation in the quantum mechanical analysis of single electron transitions@xcite .",
    "we will restrict our discussion to core electron excitations in which we use the approximation@xcite for @xmath17=re(@xmath12 ) and @xmath12@xmath2=im(@xmath12 ) , @xmath12@xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath12@xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "eq.([a2 ] ) can then be simplified to @xmath22    from now on , we will be only interested in the eels which is obtained by integrating eq.([a3 ] ) over the angular range determined by the collection condition , i.e. the convergence semi - angle @xmath23 for a convergent beam and the collection semi - angle @xmath24 for the centered collection aperture used .",
    "this gives the partial angular integrated cross section @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the orientation of the sample with respect to the electron beam direction . here",
    "the weighting factor w@xmath27 depends both on the specimen orientation and the experimental condition used , i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in order to separate out these two effects ,",
    "we have transformed the representation of * q * from the ( x , y , z ) orthogonal coordinate of the sample frame to the ( x , y , z ) orthogonal coordinate of the laboratory frame , with the z axis defined to be optical axis of the electron beam .",
    "we denote the components of * q * in the ( x , y , z ) frame as q@xmath28(fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "two representations of * q * are related to each other through the rotational transformation matrix * r * as : @xmath29 for transformation between two orthogonal coordinate systems , the rotational matrix element r@xmath27 is defined to be the direction cosine between the basis vector * e * in the ( x , y , z ) frame and the basis vector * e * in the ( x , y , z ) frame@xcite : @xmath30 substituting eq.([a5 ] ) into eq.([a4 ] ) , we get the definition for the weighting factor as : @xmath31 in this way we have successfully separated out the orientation factors , in the form of the product of matrix elements , from the integral within the bracket which is solely determined by the experimental set - up . by inspection , we can see that the integration over the full azimuthal angle of vector * q * of the integrand with the cross - indices vanishes because of the rotational symmetry .",
    "this means that the integral has the simplified forms as follows : @xmath32 where we have introduced notation q@xmath4 and q@xmath33 to denote the components of * q * that are parallel and perpendicular to the incident beam direction respectively ( fig.[fig1 ] ) and k@xmath15 is the magnitude of the wave - vector for the fast electron beam .",
    "the factor @xmath34 is used to eliminate the dimension of the reduced integral variable @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "putting the integral expression in eq.([a8 ] ) back into eq.([a7 ] ) the weighting factor can be written as : @xmath37    if we rearrange the product of the matrix element by applying the orthogonal property of the transformation matrix@xcite as @xmath38 , and through explicit calculation using eq.([a6 ] ) , we can obtain a more revealing definition for the weighting factor @xmath39 where the @xmath40 is the angle between the optical axis ( the z - direction ) of the laboratory frame and the _ ith _ basis vector in the sample frame .",
    "it is clear that the second term in eq.([a10 ] ) gives the information about orientation of the sample , so the magic angle condition is defined by the relation @xmath41    note that our derivation has not exploited any special symmetry properties of the dielectric function , for example , some specific symmetry property brought by a crystal structure .",
    "hence the magic angle condition is valid for all anisotropic systems , i.e. , it not only applies to single crystals , but also to amorphous materials , powders , or nanostructures as long as an effective dielectric function tensor can be defined and measured .",
    "the dielectric function approach is very useful in treating practical problems .",
    "however , to understand the microscopic origin of the electronic transition responsible , it is better to work explicitly in terms of a quantum mechanical theory . with the wide spread use of _ ab - initio _ quantum mechanical calculation methods , proper treatment of the electronic excitation",
    "will become be routine@xcite .",
    "it is vital to know how to relate them to measurements where specimen - orientation is an additional variable .    in quantum mechanics the inelastic scattering of high energy electrons",
    "can be described adequately by the first born approximation as@xcite : @xmath42 where a@xmath15 is bohr atomic radius , and vector * r * is the coordinate of the electrons in the sample , the initial and final states of which are represented by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . since we have not considered the screening of the fast electron coulomb potential by other electrons inside the material , this expression is only applicable to core electron excitations . because of the inverse q - dependence , electron scattering is concentrated at small angles .",
    "we can then expand the matrix element in terms of * q * and only retain the first non - zero term which is the dipole approximation@xcite , to obtain @xmath45 after projecting * q * in the sample frame ( x , y , z ) mentioned above , one can see the connection between eq.([b2 ] ) and eq.([a4 ] ) by identifying @xmath46 .",
    "the rest of the derivation can follow the procedure used in the dielectric formalism .",
    "thus , we should arrive at the same conclusion as eq.([a7 ] ) , so the magic angle condition should be the same as eq.([macondition ] ) , i.e. @xmath47 .",
    "the magic angle condition refers to the convergence and collection semi - angles , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , which define the experimental set - up where eq.([macondition ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we recall that the fast electron has the simple energy - momentum relation @xmath48 so the energy - loss process must satisfy the following energy and momentum relations @xmath49 @xmath50 or @xmath51    the simplest test case for magic angle conditions is for an experimental set - up involving parallel beam illumination . in this case",
    ", the scattering angle involved ( @xmath3 ) is just the function of the semi - angle ( @xmath52 ) , defined to be the angle between the wave vector of the scattered electrons and the electron optical axis . for an axially placed circular detector ,",
    "the maximum and minimum values of the momentum transfer are given by :    @xmath53    using above expressions for q to calculate the integral , following paxton et al.@xcite , one obtains the result for the reduced integrals defined in eq.([a8 ] ) as :    @xmath54    [ ap1 ]    this complex solution for the parallel beam illumination can be simplified because we are interested in the small - angle region where dipole approximation holds , so we can use the small angle approximation for q@xmath33 ( @xmath55 ) and q@xmath4 ( @xmath56 ) as to obtain a more simplified form for the reduced integrals    @xmath57\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ ap2][parallel ]    where we have used the reduced collection angle @xmath58 .",
    "we can solve the magic angle condition using the magic angle relation @xmath47 i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "within the small angle approximation , this is satisfied for @xmath60 , or 4@xmath61 approximately as shown initially for a uniaxial system@xcite . in fig.[fig3 ] , the magic angle solution for the parallel beam illumination set - up is plotted as a function of @xmath61 .",
    "the small - angle solution is found to be acceptable for the normal energy - loss and collection condition as the deviation from the more exact solution obtained from eq.([ap1 ] ) and ( [ ap2 ] ) is less than 5 percent .      in many cases , explicitly for a focused probe system or",
    "implicitly because of the need to increase the illumination level at the sample using a slightly convergent beam , the magic angle solution for the parallel illumination condition becomes inapplicable .",
    "to take into account the convergence effect , we need to reexamine the momentum conservation relation shown in eq.([qrelation ] ) .",
    "this vector relation can be decomposed according to the vector components parallel and perpendicular to the electron optical axis . in the small - angle approximation",
    "( see fig.[fig4 ] ) , the parallel version of this relation is a scala equation : @xmath63 and perpendicular components of * q * are defined as follows : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are azimuth angles for wave - vectors of the incident and scattered electrons respectively and @xmath3 is the scattering angle between the direction of the incident electron and that of the scattered electron .",
    "the latter is related to @xmath67 ( @xmath52 ) , the angle between the incident ( scattered ) electron and the electron beam axis , by spherical trigonometry:(see appendix ) @xmath68    then , the reduced integral defined in eq.([a8 ] ) has the following form :    @xmath69    @xmath70    [ convergence ]    where    @xmath71 ^ 2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath72    the integral can be evaluated directly as an explicit function of the convergence and collection angles as : @xmath73 -(d- c)\\right\\}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 thus the solution of eq.([macondition ] ) is equivalent to @xmath75 .",
    "eq.([convergence ] ) is equivalent to eq.([parallel ] ) when the convergence angle @xmath23 approaches zero .",
    "the numerical result is plotted as a contour in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "our result agrees with the result given by souce et al @xcite in their determination for an uniaxial system through more tedious integration .",
    "it is worth pointing out that an earlier prediction by menon and yuan@xcite for the magic angle condition in the convergent beam case is incorrect because it did not perform the actual azimuthal angular integration for both the incident beam and the scattered beam .",
    "a striking feature of the solution shown above is the symmetry , that is , the interchangeability between the beam convergence range @xmath23 of the incident electron and angular range @xmath24 of the collection of scattered electrons .",
    "this is already evident in eq.([ab ] ) .",
    "this can be traced to the small - angle approximation .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows that the surface of the edward sphere described by the fast electrons becomes a plane of constant energy in the small angle approximation .",
    "it has been argued that dependence on @xmath23 and @xmath24 are thus not symmetrical@xcite , because the interchange of @xmath67 and @xmath52 produces another momentum transfer vector which has the same parallel vector component but with a perpendicular component which is pointing in the opposite direction .",
    "thus in the general case , the interchangeability of the convergence and the collection angles may not be valid .",
    "but in angular integrated spectroscopy , and in the small angle approximation , cross - section depends only on the modular square of * q*(see eq.([a8 ] ) ) , hence the interchangeability holds .",
    "our theoretical analysis not only gives us a definition of the magic angle conditions , valid for an arbitrary anisotropic system , but it can also give a general expression for electron energy loss spectroscopy in anisotropic systems .",
    "this allows us to investigate in more detail the physical meaning of the magic angle conditions as well as understanding the discrepancy between the various reported magic angle analyses .",
    "a general expression for anisotropic eels can be worked out by substituting the result of eq.([a10 ] ) back into eq.([a4 ] ) .",
    "this gives the cross - section for the partially angular integrated electron energy - loss spectrum for core electron excitation in any anisotropic material systems in terms of their macroscopic dielectric function as : @xmath76+(\\xi_{\\parallel}-\\xi_{\\perp})\\sum_{i , j}\\cos\\chi_{i}\\cos\\chi_j\\varepsilon{_2}^{ij } ] \\label{general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the trace of the dielectric function metric tensor tr(@xmath77 ( = @xmath78 ) is invariant with respect to rotational transformation , the first part of the expression does not change with specimen orientation .",
    "the second part has a pre - factor that vanishes at the magic angle conditions .",
    "so the cross - section for core electron excitation using maeels is @xmath79\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      another way to write eq.([general ] ) is as follows : @xmath80}{3 } + ( \\xi_{\\parallel}-\\xi_{\\perp})\\sum_{i , j}(\\cos{\\chi_i}\\cos\\chi_j-\\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij})\\varepsilon^{ij}_2 \\right\\}\\label{general2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as before , the factor @xmath81 gives the magic angle condition .",
    "however , if we rotate the crystal over all possible orientations(@xmath26 ) , the averaged value of the angular dependent factors can be written as@xcite : @xmath82 this means that the second term in eq.([general2 ] ) drops out when the cross section is averaged over all the orientation , even if the magic angle condition is not satisfied , i.e. @xmath83}{3 } \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus we demonstrated that the spectrum obtained at magic angle condition is equivalent to that obtained by orientational averaging .",
    "this reason can be explained mathematically as follows .    in normal orientational averaging",
    ", the orientation can refer either to that of the specimen or the orientation of the external perturbation , i.e. the orientation of the applied field defined by the momentum transfer vector * q * in eels .",
    "we can distinguish the averaging over the azimuth angle from 0 to 2@xmath0 , from averaging over the polar angle form 0 to @xmath0 . in maeels ,",
    "the azimuth angle averaging is achieved by using an axially placed circular detector .",
    "the remaining orientational averaging of * q * over the full polar angle range is not possible to achieve in eels experiments , but the equivalent result may be obtained by integrating over a limited range of polar angles because electron scattering is skewed towards the small angle . however , it is not always possible to find the appropriate polar angular range , hence the magic angle condition is not trivial .",
    "now we can compare our prediction for the magic angle value with other derivations ( see table.1 ) and to analysis the reasons for the diversity of the values predicted .",
    "menon and yuan@xcite and souche et al@xcite both derived their values by working out the anisotropic spectral response in the uniaxial system , but otherwise their conclusions are identical with ours .",
    "our general result is in agreement with their prediction for the specific uniaxial system .",
    "most interesting is that of paxton et al .",
    "@xcite who tried to derive a general theory for the magic angle condition",
    ". in their paper , the momentum transfer vector * q * is projected in the laboratory frame ( x , y , z ) defined above , so we have the quantum mechanical transitional matrix element as : @xmath84 + 2q_yq_z\\emph{\\textbf{re}}[\\langle y\\rangle\\langle z\\rangle^ * ] + 2q_zq_x\\emph{\\textbf{re}}[\\langle z\\rangle\\langle x\\rangle^ * ] \\label{qm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , the @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 have the similar definition . as discussed above , using the weighting given in eq.([a8 ] ) , the angular integrated cross section can be written as : @xmath91    if @xmath92,then we have : @xmath93 paxton et al .",
    "@xcite derived the magic angle condition by insisting that the isotropic spectra are given by this equation without giving detailed explanation . to show that it is orientation independent , we first consider a case where the specimen frame coincides with the lab frame , then @xmath94 as the latter is proportional to the trace of the imaginary part of the dielectric function , it is invariable to rotation .",
    "so paxton et al .",
    "@xcite chose the correct magic angle condition , and should arrive at the same value for the magic angle as we do . but for reasons we could not understand , they concluded that the ma@xmath4 is about 1.36@xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "we believe that it is a trivial mistake .",
    "daniels et al.s derivation@xcite has some similarity with our eq.([qm ] ) , but they have used the substitution in the beam direction coordinate ( x , y , z ) as : @xmath95 where the r@xmath96 was defined as the magnitude of vector * r@xmath96 * -the position vector of the sample electron in the x - y plane where the collection aperture lies , and q@xmath96 has a similar definition . however , daniels et al assumed that @xmath97 , so their subsequent calculation can not be correct .",
    "zhu et al.@xcite correctly recognized the importance of the rotationally symmetry of the experimental set - up , i.e. that the cross term as shown in eq.([a8 ] ) should vanish in integrating over azimuthal angle , so they focused on estimating the weighting of the cross - section along the polar angular range as : @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "the normalization factor in the denominator is just the equivalent expression for the isotropic system and we can define it as n. in the small angle approximation , we have :    @xmath100    in fact @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the so called mean scattering angle defined in egerton s book @xcite , and has a value @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "i.e. in his definition @xmath105 and we can be resolve @xmath106 according to this relation . for comparison , our equivalent integrals defined in eq.([a8 ] ) and ( [ macondition ] ) can be rewritten under the small angle approximation as :    @xmath107    thus the guess of zhu et al is incorrect numerically . by a similar argument",
    ", gloter et al@xcite guessed a different weighting of transition with * q * parallel the beam direction and roughly estimated it with ( * * q**@xmath108@xmath109@xmath15)@xmath110/q@xmath110@xmath111@xmath110 .",
    "they also used the isotropic angular distribution as normalized factor .",
    "remarkably , their guess is correct for parallel illumination case , but their expression can not correctly account for the convergence effect because it does not consider the scattering when the incident and scattered electron beams are not in the same plane as the beam optical axis .    in summary , we have analyzed the reasons for different prediction of magic angle values , and found all the discrepancies can be properly accounted for .",
    "this suggests that there is no fundamental objections to our theoretical model .",
    "we will discuss the discrepancy between the experimental measurement@xcite and the theoretical predicted value of magic angle in elsewhere .",
    "we want to emphasis here that the discrepancy is not due to errors in the theoretical analysis , but rather because of the simplicity of the theoretical assumption or the experimental interpretation .",
    "we can list a number of factors that might modify the prediction in our model , such as non - dipole transition@xcite , coherent scattering effect@xcite , channelling effect@xcite , relativistic effect@xcite .",
    "but our analysis showed that they may affect the exact values of the magic angle , but not the conclusion that magic angle effect , if it exists , applies to all anisotropic systems and that the spectra collected under magic angle condition represents an orientation averaging .",
    "we will discuss special cases for the symmetries exemplified by crystalline systems , although in fact the systems can be amorphous or nanostructured .",
    "this allows us to write out the explicit form of the dielectric function , hence the precise form of the cross - section for the partially angular integrated eels core loss excitation :    \\i ) _ isotropic systems _",
    "this category includes cubic crystals where the non - diagonal elements vanish and the diagonal elements are identical , of which the imaginary parts are set to be @xmath112 .",

    "the cross section eq.([orthogonal ] ) can be rearranged as : @xmath122}{3 } + ( \\xi_{\\parallel}-\\xi_{\\perp})\\sum_j(\\cos^2\\chi_j-\\frac{1}{3})\\varepsilon^{jj}_2\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    again the first part is rotationally invariant so it represents the isotropic spectrum . the second part contains the information about the specimen rotation .",
    "the first bracket represents the factor responsible for the magic angle condition .",
    "the interesting point is the existence of other factors @xmath123 inside the summation over _",
    "j_. this suggests that the second part will also vanish if all the brackets within the summation sign equal to zero .",
    "they uniquely define a specific specimen orientation ( @xmath124 ) which we may label as the magic orientation .",
    "again the spectrum so obtained equals that obtained at the magic angle condition or by through orientational averaging .",
    "this is understandable as @xmath125 is the projection of the _ jth _ basis vector at the optical axis , so each principle symmetry electronic excitation contributes equally . by rotation symmetry about the beam direction , the same result holds for the more general case involving convergence illumination .    in uniaxial systems",
    "whose dielectric function has only two variables @xmath126 and @xmath127 , the angular integrated cross section as shown in eq.([uniaxial ] ) becomes @xmath128    clearly , the magic orientation defined above is reduced to a magic angle between the z - axis of the sample and the optical axis , i.e.@xmath129 in uniaxial system .",
    "however , we have distinguished this magic angle of specimen orientation with the magic angle for the beam convergence and collection in maeels .    in summary",
    ", the magic orientation can provide a set up at which the spectra should be the same as the spectra gained at the magic angle for the system where the symmetry is higher than orthogonal , and this magic orientation will lose its meaning in a system whose dielectric function has the non - zero off - diagonal elements .    our analysis suggests that a better way to represent the anisotropic response of eels is to write it as a linear combination of the orientationally averaged ( also called isotropic ) spectrum and an orientation dependent spectrum . in uniaxial systems , the orientation - dependent spectrum can be further expressed as a product of the magic angle factor , the magic orientation factor and a dichroic spectrum : @xmath130 where    @xmath131    this formula should offer a practical way to study the anisotropy in the core electron excitation as well as encoding the magic angle and magic orientation conditions .",
    "the magic orientation effect has a direct analogue with the magic angle effect in xas experiments and less directly with magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance ( mas - nmr ) .    in surface",
    "extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( sexafs)@xcite , one can study the bonding length as well as local coordination number of the excited atoms .",
    "however , contribution of more than one shell to the measured exafs can result in _ a polarization dependent measured distance _ from absorbing atom to the neighboring atoms and affect the effective coordinate number .",
    "if there is higher than twofold symmetry around the surface normal , the correct distance and the real coordinate number can be directly measured if the angle , between the electric field vector * e * of the incident x - ray and the surface normal of the single crystal , is equivalent to 54.7@xmath132 exactly .",
    "this is because the system being probed is effectively an uniaxial system .",
    "another famous example is the mas - nmr technique for solid@xcite .",
    "if the material , whether it is a single crystal , polycrystal or power , spun with high speed about an axis which is respect to the applied magnetic field with 54.7@xmath132 , the nmr result will be independent of the orientation of the sample .",
    "mas - nmr is also related to the orientational magic angle effect because one is effectively using spinning to create an effective uniaxial system out of powered samples .",
    "we have presented a general model describing anisotropy of the core - level electron excitation in eels measurement and have determined the magic angle condition at which the sample orientation becomes irrelevant . after comparing our derivation with reported theoretical efforts",
    ", we can explain all the reasons for disagreement in the literature predicting the value of the magic angle and showed that the differences in no way invalid our approach .",
    "furthermore , for the first time , we showed that the magic angle condition is applicable in all anisotropic systems and that the spectrum at the magic angle condition is equivalent to the rotational average of the sample .",
    "the same analysis can also give the general expression for electron energy loss spectroscopy of core electron excitation in anisotropic system .",
    "in high symmetry cases , it leads to the discovery of the magic orientation condition .",
    "its relation with other magic angle effect is clarified .",
    "in addition , the analysis shows that eels in uniaxial system can be written as a sum of the effective isotropic spectrum and the linear dichroic spectrum .",
    "this research is supported by the national key research and development project for basic research from ministry of science and technology , the changjiang scholar program of ministry of education and the 100-talent program of the tsinghua university .",
    "the perpendicular component of the momentum transfer * q * can be seen as a sum of the perpendicular components of the initial and the final wave - vector in the case of the convergence beam as : @xmath133    according to the vector relations shown in fig.[fig4 ] under the small angle approximation , we have : @xmath134 thus the scattering angle @xmath3 can be written following the vector combination rule as : @xmath135 where the directional properties of these angular vectors are defined to be the same as the perpendicular components of their corresponding wave - vectors . according to the law of cosines , the magnitude of @xmath136",
