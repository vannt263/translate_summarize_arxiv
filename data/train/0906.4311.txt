    "we introduced in @xcite the notion of an @xmath0-planar algebra .",
    "this was useful to understand the double complexes of finite dimensional algebras which arise in the context of @xmath1 subfactors and modular invariants . here",
    "we begin a study of their planar modules .    these planar algebras are direct generalization of the planar algebras of jones @xcite . to avoid too much confusion one could refer to these planar algebras of jones here as @xmath4-planar algebras which naturally contain the temperley - lieb algebra which encodes the representation theory of quantum @xmath5 .",
    "our @xmath0-planar algebras naturally encode the representation theory of quantum @xmath1 or in the dual hecke picture , the finite dimensional algebras which appear from the representations of the deformation of the symmetric group with generators the self - adjoint operators @xmath6 and relations :    @xmath7    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the extra relation @xmath11    in @xcite we computed the numerical values of the ocneanu cells , announced by ocneanu ( e.g. @xcite ) , and consequently representations of the hecke algebra , for the @xmath1 @xmath2 graphs .",
    "these cells give numerical weight to kuperberg s @xcite diagram of trivalent vertices  corresponding to the trivial representation is contained in the triple product of the fundamental representation of @xmath1 through the determinant .",
    "they will yield in a natural way , representations of an @xmath0-temperley - lieb or hecke algebra . for @xmath5 or bipartite graphs ,",
    "the corresponding weights ( associated to the diagrams of cups or caps ) , arise in a more straightforward fashion from a perron - frobenius eigenvector , giving a natural representation of the temperley - lieb algebra or hecke algebra .",
    "the bipartite theory of the @xmath5 setting has to some degree become a three - colourable theory in our @xmath1 setting .",
    "this theory is not completely three - colourable since some of the graphs are not three - colourable- namely the graphs @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the figures for the complete list of the @xmath2 graphs are given in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly review the basic construction of jones @xmath4-planar algebras , and the notion of planar modules over these algebras .",
    "a planar @xmath16-tangle consists of a disc @xmath17 in the plane with @xmath18 vertices on its boundary , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 internal discs @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where the disc @xmath21 has @xmath23 vertices on its boundary , @xmath24 .",
    "one vertex on the boundary of each disc ( including the outer disc @xmath17 ) is chosen as a marked vertex , and the segment of the boundary of each disc between the marked vertex and the vertex immediately adjacent to it as we move around the boundary in an anti - clockwise direction is labelled @xmath25 . inside @xmath17",
    "we have a collection of disjoint smooth curves , called strings , where any string is either a closed loop , or else has as its endpoints the vertices on the discs , and such that every vertex is the endpoint of exactly one string .",
    "any tangle must also allow a checkerboard colouring of the regions inside @xmath17 .",
    "the planar operad is the collection of all diffeomorphism classes of such planar tangles , with composition of planar tangles defined .",
    "a planar algebra @xmath26 is then defined to be an algebra over this operad , i.e. a family @xmath27 of vector spaces with @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and such that for every @xmath16-tangle @xmath30 with @xmath31 internal discs @xmath21 labelled by elements @xmath32 , @xmath22 , there is an associated linear map @xmath33 , which is compatible with the composition of tangles and re - ordering of internal discs .",
    "a planar module over @xmath26 is a graded vector space @xmath34 with an action of @xmath26 . given a planar @xmath35-tangle @xmath30 in @xmath36 with distinguished ( `` @xmath37 input '' ) internal disc @xmath38 with with @xmath18 vertices on its boundary , @xmath19 , and other ( `` @xmath26 input '' ) internal discs @xmath39 , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 vertices on its boundary , @xmath42",
    ", there is a linear map @xmath43 , where @xmath44 satisfies the same compatability conditions as for @xmath26 itself .      in the case of @xmath5 , jones @xcite determined all hilbert modules @xmath48 of lowest weight @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 of lowest weight 0",
    ". we will give a brief overview of these modules .",
    "for @xmath52 , let @xmath53 denote the space of all annular @xmath54-tangles ( having @xmath55 vertices on the outer disc and @xmath18 vertices on the ( distinguished ) inner disc , where the vertices have alternating orientations ) with no other internal discs , where composition of tangles is defined by inserting one annular @xmath54-tangle inside the internal disc of an annular @xmath56-tangle .",

    "the group @xmath61 acts by an internal rotation , which permutes the basis elements .",

    "since the action of @xmath62 commutes with the action of @xmath61 , as a @xmath3-module @xmath60 splits as a direct sum , over the @xmath72 roots of unity @xmath73 , of @xmath3-modules @xmath74 which are the eigenspaces for the action of @xmath61 with eigenvalue @xmath73 . for each @xmath16 one can choose a faithful trace @xmath75 on the abelian @xmath76-algebra @xmath77 , which extends to @xmath78 by composition with the quotient map . the inner - product on @xmath60 is then defined to be @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
