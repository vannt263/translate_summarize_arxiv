    "the understanding of the structure of nuclei far from stability with extreme isospin is one the most exciting challenges of present nuclear physics .",
    "new experimental facilities with radioactive nuclear beams make it possible to investigate the nuclear chart to the very limits of nuclear binding .",
    "a wealth of structure phenomena in exotic nuclei have been reported and the next generation of radioactive - beam facilities will present new exciting opportunities to study not only the ground states but also excitations and spectra of these strongly interacting many - body systems .",
    "this situation has stimulated considerable new efforts on the theoretical side to understand the dynamics of the nuclear many - body problem by microscopic methods .",
    "exact solutions of the non - relativistic schrdinger equation based on the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction are used to study very light nuclei with @xmath0 by an ab initio \" approach , modern shell - model calculations based on large scale diagonalization techniques and truncation schemes show considerable success in situations where configuration mixing calculations are possible , i.e. in light nuclei or in nuclei with single magic or doubly magic configurations . for the large majority of nuclei ,",
    "however , a quantitative microscopic description is , so far , only possible by density functional theory ( dft ) and its extensions . although dft can , in principle , provide an exact description of many - body problems@xcite , if the exact density functional is known , in nuclear physics one is far from a microscopic derivation of this functional .",
    "in addition , nuclei are self - bound systems . as a consequence of translational invariance",
    "the density in the laboratory frame is constant in space .",
    "density functional theory in nuclei is therefore based on the intrinsic density , a concept that requires additional approximations  @xcite .",
    "the most successful schemes of dft in nuclei use a phenomenological ansatz incorporating as many symmetries of the system as possible and adjusting the parameters of the functional to ground state properties of a few characteristic nuclei on the nuclear chart .",
    "considerable progress has been reported recently in constructing such functionals .",
    "for a recent review see  @xcite .",
    "one of the underlying symmetries of qcd is lorentz invariance and therefore covariant density functionals  @xcite are of particular interest in nuclear physics .",
    "this symmetry not only allows to describe the spin - orbit coupling , which has an essential influence on the underlying shell structure , in a consistent way , but it also puts stringent restrictions on the number of parameters in the corresponding functionals without reducing the quality of the agreement with experimental data .",
    "most of the nuclei are superfluid systems and therefore the inclusion of pairing correlations is essential for a correct description of structure phenomena in open - shell nuclei  @xcite .",
    "hartree - bogoliubov theory provides a unified description of @xmath1- and @xmath2-correlations on a mean - field level by using two type of densities , the normal density matrix @xmath3 and antisymmetric pairing tensor @xmath4  @xcite . according to valatin",
    "these two densities can be combined to the generalized density matrix @xmath5 of double dimension @xcite .",
    "cdft theory for superfluid systems is therefore based on a generalized relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) energy density @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "the same is true for the landau - migdal theory and for all the methods discussed in this paper . for simplicity , however , we restrict all our considerations in this article to the case without pairing correlations .",
    "pairing correlations can be included on all steps by using super - matrices .",
    "details are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . only in the applications we present also calculations in isotopic chains of open shell nuclei , that include pairing correlations",
    ".    a very successful example of a covariant density functional theory is the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model  @xcite .",
    "it combines a density dependence through a non - linear coupling between the meson fields  @xcite with pairing correlations based on an effective interaction of finite range . a large variety of nuclear phenomena",
    "have been described over the years within this model : the equation of state in symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , ground state properties of finite spherical and deformed nuclei all over the periodic table  @xcite from light nuclei  @xcite to super - heavy elements  @xcite , from the neutron drip line , where halo phenomena are observed  @xcite to the proton drip line  @xcite with nuclei unstable against the emission of protons  @xcite .    in principle",
    "density functional theory can be used for the description of all properties depending on the single - particle density .",
    "it is therefore not only limited to the description of the ground state properties .",
    "the same density functionals have also been applied for a very successful description of excited states , such as rotational bands in normal and super - deformed nuclei  @xcite and collective vibrations  @xcite .",
    "rotations are treated in the cranking approximation providing a quasi - static description of the nuclear dynamics in a rotating frame and for the description of vibrations a time - dependent mean field approximation is used by assuming independent particle motion in time - dependent average fields  @xcite . in the small amplitude limit one obtains the relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa )  @xcite and in superfluid nuclei the relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation ( rqrpa )  @xcite .",
    "this method provides a natural framework to investigate collective and non - collective excitations of @xmath1- ( or @xmath7 ) character .",
    "it is successful in particular for the understanding of the position of giant resonances and spin- or / and isospin - excitations as the gamov teller resonance ( gtr ) or the isobaric analog resonance ( iar ) .",
    "recently it has been also used for a theoretical interpretation of low lying e1-strengths observed in neutron rich isotopes ( pygmy modes )  @xcite and for low - lying collective quadrupole excitations  @xcite .    density functional theory in nuclei",
    "is based on intrinsic densities and on the mean field approach .",
    "therefore it can not provide an exact treatment of the full nuclear dynamics .",
    "it breaks down in  transitional nuclei , where the intrinsic density is not well defined and where one has to include correlations going beyond the mean field approximation by treating quantum fluctuations through a superposition of several mean field solutions , as for instance in the generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite .",
    "but it also provides a poor approximation for the single - particle spectra particularly in ideal shell model nuclei such as @xmath8pb with closed protons and neutron shells .",
    "one finds in self - consistent mean field calculations usually a considerably enhanced hartree - fock gap in the single - particle spectrum and a reduced level density at the fermi surface as compared with the experiment .",
    "it is well known that this fact is connected with the relatively small effective mass in such models .",
    "mahaux and collaborators  @xcite have shown that the effective mass in nuclear matter is roughly @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "in finite nuclei it should be modified by the coupling of the single - particle motion to low - lying collective surface vibrations .",
    "this leads , in the vicinity of the fermi surface , to an enhancement of @xmath9 @xmath11 .",
    "non - self - consistent models with the bare mass ( @xmath9 @xmath11 ) show indeed a single - particle spectrum with a level density close to the experiment . with a few exceptions , where the quadrupole motion has been studied within the relativistic generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite , applications of covariant density functional theory to the description of excited states",
    "are limited to relativistic rpa , i.e. to configurations of @xmath12-nature .",
    "none of these methods , however , can be applied to the investigation of the coupling to more complicated configurations , as it occurs for instance in the damping phenomena causing the width of giant resonances .    already before",
    "density functional theory has been introduced in the sixties for the description of quantum mechanical many - body problems by kohn and sham  @xcite landau has developed in the fifties his fermi liquid theory ( flt )  @xcite for infinite systems .",
    "it has been extended to the theory of finite fermi systems ( tffs )  @xcite by migdal .",
    "this theory provides another very successful method for the description of low - lying nuclear excitations  @xcite .",
    "it has several general properties in common with density functional theory .",
    "first , both theories are know to be exact , at least in principle , but in practice , in nuclear physics , the parameters entering these theories have to be determined in a phenomenological way by adjustment to experimental data .",
    "second , both theories are based on a single - particle concept .",
    "dft uses the mean field concept with slater determinants in an effective single - particle potential as a vehicle to introduce shell - effects in the exact density functional introduced by hohenberg and kohn  @xcite .",
    "fermi liquid theory is based on the concept of quasi - particles obeying a dyson equation , which are defined as the basic excitations of the neighboring system with odd particle number .",
    "third , in practical applications both theories describe in the simplest versions the nuclear excitations in the rpa approximation , i.e. by a linear combination of @xmath1-configurations in an average nuclear potential .    however , there are also essential differences between these two concepts . first , in contrast to dft , tffs does not attempt to calculate the ground state properties of the many - body system , but it describes the nuclear excitations in terms of landau quasi - particles and their interaction . therefore the experimental data used to fix the phenomenological parameters of the theories are bulk properties of the ground state in the case of density functional theory , and properties of single - particle excitations and of the collective excitations in the case of finite fermi systems theory .",
    "second , in dft the mean field is determined in a self - consistent way and therefore the rpa spectrum contains goldstone modes at zero energy .",
    "this is usually not the case in tffs calculations , which are based on a non - relativistic shell - model potential , whose parameters are adjusted to the experimental single - particle spectra . therefore ,",
    "apart from a few approximate attempts to treat the goldstone modes by adjusting additional parameters in the effective quasiparticle interaction , there is no self - consistency in the rpa calculations of tffs and the goldstone modes do not separate from the other modes .",
    "they are distributed among the low - lying excitations .",
    "third , modern versions of tffs go much beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "the coupling between the particles and the phonons is investigated with green s function techniques .",
    "based on the phonons calculated in the framework of the rpa one has included particle - phonon coupling vertices and an energy dependence of the self - energy in the dyson equation  @xcite .",
    "this leads also to an induced interaction in the bethe - salpeter equation caused by the exchange of phonons which also depends on the energy .",
    "the coupling of particles and phonons has also been derived from nuclear field theory ( nft ) and its extensions  @xcite .",
    "many aspects of the coupling between the quasi - particles and the collective vibrations have been investigated with these techniques  @xcite as well as with other kinds of approaches beyond rpa  @xcite over the years .",
    "we give here an overview over recent attempts  @xcite to find a combination of the basic ideas of covariant density functional theory and landau - migdal theory and show as examples corresponding applications .",
    "the concept is similar to earlier work in refs .",
    "@xcite , where specific non - relativistic energy functionals have been used to construct a self - consistent theory of finite fermi systems .",
    "the starting point is a covariant density functional @xmath13 $ ] widely used in the literature .",
    "it is adjusted to ground state properties of characteristic nuclei and , without any additional parameter , it provides the necessary input of finite fermi systems theory , such as the mean field and the single - particle spectrum as well as an effective interaction between the @xmath1-configurations in terms of the second derivative of the same energy @xmath13 $ ] with respect to the density .",
    "thus the phenomenological input of landau - migdal theory is replaced by the results of density functional theory .",
    "the same interaction is used to calculate the vertices for particle - vibration coupling  @xcite . in a second step techniques of landau - migdal theory and its modern extensions",
    "are used to describe the coupling of one- and two - quasiparticle configurations .",
    "the main assumption of the quasiparticle - phonon coupling model is that two types of elementary excitations  two - quasiparticle and vibrational modes  are coupled in such a way that configurations of @xmath14 type with low - lying phonons strongly compete with simple @xmath12 configurations close in energy or , in other words , that quasiparticles can emit and absorb phonons with rather high probabilities . in this way",
    "a fully consistent description of the many - body dynamics is obtained . as a result an induced additional interaction between single - particle and vibrational excitations provides a strong fragmentation of the pure rqrpa states causing the spreading width of giant resonances and the redistribution of the pygmy strength .",
    "two essential approximations are used in this context : first , the _ time - blocking approximation _ ( tba )  @xcite , that has been extended to systems with pairing correlations ( qtba ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , blocks in a special time - projection technique the @xmath12-propagation through states which have a more complex structure than @xmath14 . the nuclear response can then be explicitly calculated on the @xmath15 level by summation of an infinite series of feynman s diagrams .",
    "second , a special _ subtraction technique _ guarantees , that there is no double counting between the additional correlations introduced by particle - vibration coupling and the ground state correlations already taken into account in the phenomenological density functional .",
    "these two tools are essential for the success of this method .",
    "tba introduces a consistent truncation scheme into the bethe - salpeter equation and without it it would be hard to solve the equations explicitly .",
    "the subtraction method is the essential tool to connect density functional theory so far used only on the level of mean field theory , i.e. on the rpa level , with the extended landau - migdal theory , where complex configurations are included through particle - vibration coupling .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section ii we discuss shortly the general formalism of covariant density functional theory , we introduce in section iii the concept of the energy - dependent self - energy @xmath16 and the vertices of particle - vibration coupling in the relativistic framework , and we discuss in section iv the response formalism , the time blocking approximation and the subtraction mechanism for the response function . in section v we present recent numerical applications for the calculation of level densities at the fermi surface and the spreading width of the several nuclei .",
    "section vi contains a brief summary and an outlook for future applications .",
    "covariant density functional theory uses the walecka model  @xcite as a lorentz invariant framework for the formulation of the density functional . in this model the nucleus is described as a system of dirac nucleons coupled to the exchange mesons and the electromagnetic field through an effective lagrangian .",
    "the isoscalar scalar @xmath17-meson , the isoscalar vector @xmath18-meson , and the isovector vector @xmath19-meson build the minimal set of meson fields that together with the electromagnetic field is necessary for a quantitative description of bulk and single - particle nuclear properties  @xcite .",
    "the model is defined by the lagrangian density @xmath20 @xmath21 denotes the lagrangian of the free nucleon @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the bare nucleon mass and @xmath24 denotes the dirac spinor .",
    "@xmath25 is the lagrangian of the free meson fields and the electromagnetic field @xmath26 with the corresponding masses @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are field tensors ( arrows denote isovectors and boldface symbols are for vectors in ordinary space ) .",
    "the minimal set of interaction terms is contained in @xmath33 @xmath34 with the vertices@xmath35 with the coupling constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 for protons or neutrons ) .",
    "already in the earliest applications of the rmf framework it was realized , however , that this simple model with interaction terms only linear in the meson fields , does not provide a quantitative description of complex nuclear systems .",
    "an effective density dependence was introduced  @xcite by replacing the quadratic @xmath42-potential @xmath43 with a non - linear meson coupling potential @xmath44 , which contains additional parameters .",
    "this particular form of the non - linear potential has become standard in applications of rmf models , although additional non - linear interaction terms , both in the isoscalar and isovector channels , have also been considered  @xcite .",
    "> from the model lagrangian density the classical variation principle leads to the equations of motion:@xmath45   \\psi=0 . \\label{dirac0}%\\ ] ] if one neglects retardation effects for the meson fields , which is well justified because of the large meson masses , a self - consistent solution is obtained when the time - dependent mean - field potentials @xmath46 are calculated at each step in time by the solution of the static klein - gordon equations @xmath47 where the ( @xmath48 ) sign is for vector fields and the ( @xmath49 ) sign for the scalar field .",
    "the index @xmath23 denotes mesons and the photon , i.e. @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is derivative of the corresponding potential with respect to the meson field .    in applications to nuclear matter and finite nuclei , the relativistic models are used in the _ no - sea _ approximation , i.e. the dirac sea of states with negative energies does not contribute to the densities and currents and one uses @xmath52 where the sum runs only over the occupied states in the fermi sea , i.e. vacuum polarization effects are neglected . in fact , many effects that go beyond the classical mean - field level are apparently neglected in the this models : fock terms , vacuum polarization effects , and the short range brueckner - type correlations . the experimental data to which the meson - nucleon couplings are adjusted , however , contain all these effects and much more .",
    "it follows that effects beyond the mean - field level are implicitly included in the rmf approach by adjusting the model parameters to reproduce a selected empirical data set .",
    "vacuum effects , chiral symmetry , nucleon substructure , exchange terms , long- and short - range correlation effects are , therefore , effectively included in this approach although neither of them can be accessed separately .",
    "the set of coupled equations ( [ dirac0 ] ) and ( [ kg0 ] ) define the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model . in the stationary case",
    "they reduce to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem and in the time - dependent case they describe the nonlinear propagation of the dirac spinors in time  @xcite .",
    "rmf models can be also formulated without explicitly including mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "meson - exchange interactions can be replaced by local four - point interactions between nucleons .",
    "it has been shown that the relativistic point - coupling models  @xcite are completely equivalent to the standard meson - exchange approach . in order to describe properties of finite nuclei on a quantitative level , the point - coupling models include also some higher order interaction terms .",
    "for instance , six - nucleon vertices @xmath53 , and eight - nucleon vertices @xmath54 and @xmath55^{2}$ ] .",
    "these relatively simple models turn out to provide a very successful phenomenological description of the nuclear many - body system all over the periodic table .",
    "relatively few parameters are adjusted to ground state properties of a few finite nuclei . at a first glance",
    "it is not easy to see how can such a simple approach can be so successful .",
    "this can be only understood if one considers that this model represents an approximate implementation of kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft)@xcite , which is successfully employed in the treatment of the quantum many - body problem in atomic , molecular and condensed matter physics .",
    "it is evident that equations of motion ( [ dirac0 ] ) and ( [ kg0 ] ) can also be directly derived form a density functional . using the definition of the relativistic single - nucleon density matrix @xmath56 the total energy can be written as a functional of the density matrix @xmath57 and of the meson fields @xmath58=\\text{tr}\\left [ ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\alpha$}}\\mathbf{p}+\\beta m)\\hat{\\rho}\\right ]   \\pm\\int\\left [   \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\phi_{m}% ) ^{2}+u(\\phi_{m})\\right ]   d^{3}r+\\text{tr}\\left [   ( \\gamma_{m}\\phi_{m}% ) \\hat{\\rho}\\right ]   .\\label{e - rmf}%\\ ] ] the trace operation involves a sum over the dirac indices and an integral in coordinate space .",

    "first , pairing correlations lead to a diffuseness of the fermi surface and , thus , increase the number of possible @xmath220 configurations , and second , pairing correlations cause a considerable lowering of the energies and increased transition probabilities of the lowest 2@xmath197 states . in",
    "spherical open - shell medium mass nuclei the highly collective first 2@xmath197 states appear at energies around 1 mev ( and they are usually well reproduced in rqrpa  @xcite ) whereas in magic nuclei and often in nuclei near the shell closures they appear much higher , at about 3 - 4 mev and have considerably reduced transition probabilities .",
    "this causes a strong configuration mixing in the case of presence of very low - lying vibrational states .",
    "these modes admix to others , in particular , to the gdr and the pdr and the lower their energies and the higher their transition probabilities are , the stronger fragmentation they cause .",
    "a systematic analysis of the transition densities of the rqrpa and the rqtba states shows that the @xmath7 transition densities in the broad low - lying energy region dominated by the fragmentation of the rqrpa pygmy mode have a very similar behavior as the initial rqrpa state : proton and neutron components oscillate in phase in the nuclear interior and neutron components dominate on the surface in nuclei with noticeable neutron excess .",
    "we have given an overview over recent efforts to combine two theoretical methods for the description of the quantum - mechanical many - body problem of nuclear physics , covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) and landau - migdal theory of finite fermi systems ( tffs ) .",
    "both methods are very successful and they are claimed to provide in principle an exact description . in practice , however , there are limitations .",
    "both methods use phenomenological input .",
    "dft can only be applied to physical quantities , which can be expressed in terms of the single - particle density and in self - bound systems such as nuclei dft is based on the intrinsic density , a concept , which requires additional approximations . in particular the self - energy used in dft theory does not depend on the energy .",
    "landau - migdal theory on the other side restrains itself from calculating ground state properties , but it goes far beyond the mean field approach and takes into account couplings to complex configurations .",
    "there are also similarities for these two methods .",
    "both are based on a single - particle description , i.e. on the motion of independent particles . in density",
    "functional theory an average field in introduced as a vehicle in order to take into account shell effects .",
    "however , the single - particle energies themselves are not observables in the strict sense .",
    "landau - migdal theory uses quasiparticles as the exact eigenstates of the @xmath221-systems . in both cases",
    "the self energies are given as the first derivatives of the total energy with respect to the density and the effective interactions between the particles are the second derivatives of this quantity .",
    "the combination of cdft and tffs described in this manuscript starts from the covariant density functional .",
    "no further parameters are needed .",
    "this functional is used to describe the ground state properties and the parameters of the functional are adjusted to experimental data of ground states of several nuclei . on this level the self - energy does not depend on the energy and landau - migdal theory is used to introduce an energy dependence with a particle - vibrational scheme .",
    "the properties of the phonons needed for the calculation of the energy - dependent part of the self - energy are phonon energies and phonon - nucleon vertices .",
    "they are calculated with the static effective interaction obtained as the second derivative of the density functional .",
    "no additional parameters are needed .",
    "the essential equation of the landau - migdal theory is the response equation .",
    "the effective interaction to calculate the full response is the derivative of the self - energy with respect to the density and this means that one obtains in addition to the static interaction resulting from the energy - independent part an induced interaction resulting from the energy - dependent part of the self - energy .",
    "of course there would be double counting , because many of the correlations induced by the coupling of virtual phonons have also contributions at the ground state energy .",
    "therefore a subtraction method is introduced , which removes from the induced interaction at finite energy its value at zero energy , i.e. after this subtraction , the induced interaction vanishes at the ground state and takes into account only its energy dependence .",
    "therefore this subtraction procedure guarantees that one does not need to readjust the parameters of the density functional , because the effects of particle - vibrational coupling vanish at the ground state of the even - even system , where the parameters are adjusted .",
    "we have discussed several applications of this method , as the fragmentation of single - particle energies in odd - mass nuclei in the vicinity of a double magic configuration .",
    "close to the fermi surface there is always a dominant pole with a reduced single - particle strength and many other poles with rather small strength .",
    "the dominant pole is shifted in the direction of the fermi surface , i.e. the level density at the fermi surface is increased .",
    "the effective mass derived from this level density in the pb region is considerably increased , but there is still room for an additional energy dependence of the self - energy not taken into account by the coupling to surface vibrations .",
    "in addition we discussed several solutions of the response equations for nuclei in an external field . this allows to calculate the strength functions with respect to an external operator and the photo absorption cross sections in the correlated system .",
    "if one takes into account only the static part of the interaction one finds the usual rpa or qrpa results of time - dependent density functional theory , which reproduces the position of the resonances rather well , but it can not account for the width that has its origin in the coupling to more complicated configurations .",
    "the energy - dependent part of the interaction includes this coupling and therefore it induces again a fragmentation of the rather sharp resonance peaks in rpa of qrpa over many complex configurations . because of the subtraction procedure the position of the resonances is not changed very much , but the width is considerably increased , in excellent agreement with experimental data .",
    "of course there is room for additional improvements .",
    "so far , for numerical simplicity , exist only applications of this theory with the parameter set nl3 , which has no density dependence in the is isovector channel . at present there exist more modern parameter sets with the density dependent meson exchange @xcite which give already on the mean field level improved results for characteristic properties such as the neutron skin of neutron - rich nuclei or the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "they should also be implemented in the theoretical investigations of the type discussed in this article .",
    "a further improvement can be achieved by using a more realistic pairing force .",
    "so far there are only investigations available with a monopole pairing force .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to implement in the pairing channel a density dependent zero range force or the finite range gogny force .",
    "all the calculations presented here have been done in a discrete basis , i.e. in the spectral representation of the response equation and therefore the coupling to the continuum is not taken into account properly so far .",
    "this might have a strong influence on application to light nuclei and therefore relativistic continuum rpa should be extended to relativistic continuum qrpa and relativistic continuum qtba .",
    "finally , so far ground state correlations have been taken into account only on the rqrpa level . in the non - relativistic case there",
    "exist investigations going beyond this limitations .",
    "they should be extended also to the relativistic calculations .",
