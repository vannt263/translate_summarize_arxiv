    "`` soft '' physics is manifest in various places in different guises .",
    "the interest in soft interactions at _ very high _ energies is stimulated , theoretically , by the fact that the observed hadronic cross sections are growing with energy and , experimentally , by the advent of the lhc .    at the lhc energy we have to allow for unitarity effects , which are necessary to provide the consistency of the strong interaction .",
    "in fact , when we face a cross section which grows as a power of the energy , there are two possible ways to restore unitarity .    first , we may introduce a new particle ( sufficiently heavy to have not been observed yet ) which cancels the growth of the cross section at energies larger than the mass of the particle ( for example , higgs boson , super - partners , etc . ) .",
    "after this , we deal with a _ weak _ interaction , where the main contribution comes from one , or a few , simple diagrams .",
    "more complicated feynman graphs just describe corrections to the lowest - order amplitude .",
    "another possibility is to consider a _",
    "strong _ interaction . here , from the beginning , we start with a hermitian lagrangian , which should already account for unitarity . when the born amplitude ( or an amplitude obtained via the summation of some group of diagrams ) becomes too large and the interaction becomes strong , then new more complicated diagrams must enter the game .",
    "it is the contribution due to these new graphs which tames the growth of cross section such that the final result satisfies unitarity .    in the case of qcd , where the bfkl amplitude ( @xmath3 ) grows as a non - integer power ( @xmath4 ) of energy , @xmath5",
    ", we expect to observe the second scenario by introducing a new particle . ] .",
    "therefore it is important to observe , and to study , the role of more complicated diagrams ( arising from multiple interactions ) at lhc energies , and to trace how the theory restores the unitarity of the _ strong _ interaction .",
    "that is , from a theoretical viewpoint , it is of great interest to observe experimentally how unitarity tames the growth of high - energy hadronic amplitudes , leading to saturation both in the transverse momenta @xmath6 and in the impact parameter @xmath7 distributions of the produced particles . in other words",
    ", unitarity replaces the growth of the amplitude by the growth of configuration space occupied by the particles , both in @xmath7 and in @xmath6 .    here , we do not present new results but attempt to recall , using modern language , the ideas and understanding of high - energy soft interactions which originated some 40 or more years ago .",
    "the discussion may be divided into three main topics : ( i ) elastic scattering and the total cross section , ( ii ) the cross sections of processes with gaps in rapidity ( including high - mass diffractive dissociation ) , and , ( iii ) the saturation of particle densities in transverse momenta @xmath6 .",
    "soft high - energy @xmath8 interactions are clearly important at the lhc .",
    "moreover , they can complicate our ability to observe new physics .",
    "for example , topic ( iii ) is relevant to the search for new physics , since particles with a rather large @xmath6 from the underlying inclusive event will affect the jet searching algorithm , as is already the case for jets at hera and the tevatron . on the other hand",
    ", the evaluation of the cross section for an exclusive process , such as @xmath9 , requires knowledge of the gap survival probability @xmath10 , which is the subject of topic ( ii ) , see , for example , @xcite .    here , we focus on the qualitative features of high energy soft interactions .",
    "these features are quite general . with the advent of the lhc ,",
    "it is timely to gather them together and to emphasize the underlying physics .",
    "the behaviour of scattering amplitudes in the high energy , @xmath5 , small momentum - transfer squared , @xmath11 , domain is well described by regge theory ; that is , by the singularities of amplitudes in the complex angular momentum , @xmath12 , plane , see , for example , @xcite . for instance , the measured @xmath13 amplitude behaves as a(s , t ) s^_(t ) where the @xmath14-trajectory , @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 in @xmath17 ) , passes through the spin-1 @xmath14-meson resonance in the ` crossed ' @xmath16-channel @xmath18 ; that is , @xmath19 .    on the other hand ,",
    "total cross sections are observed to grow slowly with energy and are associated with the exchange of a trajectory with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "the simplest possibility is to assume that at high energy these cross sections , such as the @xmath8 total cross section @xmath20 , are driven by an isolated pole at @xmath21 , which gives an ( @xmath8 ) elastic amplitude a(s , t ) s^_p ( t ) , and , via the optical theorem of fig .",
    "[ fig : opt ] , a total cross section _ tot s^_p ( 0)-1 . the pole with the largest intercept , originally with @xmath22 since high energy total cross sections were thought to have constant asymptotic behaviour , was called the _",
    "pomeron_. here we are interested in tevatron and higher energies which are sufficiently large to be able to neglect the contributions of all secondary trajectories ( which all have intercepts @xmath23 ) .     total cross section to the imaginary part of the forward elastic @xmath8 amplitude ; ( b ) the application of the optical theorem to obtain the cross section for the dissociation of the ` beam ' proton into a high - mass system , see sections [ sec : sd ] and [ sec : lrg2 ] .",
    "the high - energy pomeron - exchange expressions that are shown for the _ bare _ amplitudes have sizeable absorptive ( that is , unitarity or screening ) corrections ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the pomeron - proton and triple - pomeron couplings respectively . , height=264 ]    a popular parametrization of elastic @xmath8-scattering amplitude by donnachie - landshoff ( dl ) is the regge form @xcite @xmath26 where the signature factor @xmath27 gives the complex phase , @xmath28 is the electromagnetic form factor of the proton , and the _ effective _ soft pomeron trajectory _",
    "p=1++ t  1 + 0.08 + 0.25 t , [ eq : dl ] where @xmath16 is in gev@xmath29 .",
    "the intercept @xmath30 just above 1 reproduces the observed slow growth of the total hadron - hadron cross sections at high energies .",
    "indeed , the effective pomeron pole amplitude , ( [ eq : dl ] ) , gives a good description of the total and elastic differential cross section data up to tevatron energies .",
    "however , this simple parametrization is expected to become increasingly deficient at higher energies .",
    "unitarity is an easy way to see this .",
    "to discuss unitarity effects it is convenient to work in impact parameter , @xmath7 , space , since at high energy the position of the particle in @xmath7 is practically frozen .",
    "thus the value of @xmath7 determines the orbital momentum @xmath31 of the incoming proton , @xmath32 ; that is , fixed @xmath7 corresponds to a particular partial wave @xmath31 . in @xmath7 space the elastic unitarity equation . ]",
    "@xmath33 limits the value of @xmath34 .",
    "however , this limit corresponds to a pure elastic interaction with phase of elastic amplitude , @xmath35 equal to @xmath36 . normally at high energies the inelastic contribution @xmath37 dominates , leading to a large inelasticity ; that is , to a large imaginary part , @xmath38 . in this",
    "so - called ` black disk ' limit is not forbidden .",
    "the corresponding model , so - called @xmath39-matrix unitarisation , was discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , such a model which asymptotically leads to a pure elastic interaction , without any particle production , does not look probable . ]",
    ", we have @xmath40 .",
    "recall that , if we were to neglect the small contribution from the real part , then im@xmath41 can be measured directly from experiment as the fourier transform  a(b )  =  j_0(qb )  , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is a bessel function and @xmath44 .",
    "note that the dl amplitude @xmath45 crosses the black disk limit between the tevatron and lhc energies , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dl ] .",
    "thus we expect that at the lhc the cross section will be less than that given by the dl parametrization , while the slope of elastic cross section , @xmath46 , should be larger .",
    "the partons occurring in the proton wave function will be pushed away from the centre to the periphery .",
    "this suppression of the amplitude at low values of @xmath7 automatically increases the elastic slope @xmath46 , since @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the interaction radius .    for this reason the value of @xmath49 gev@xmath50 in ( [ eq : dl ] )",
    "should not be considered as the slope of the bare pomeron trajectory .",
    "part of this slope is generated by the stronger absorptive corrections at smaller @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , the shrinkage of the diffractive cone observed in deep - inelastic scattering at hera ( say , in @xmath14-meson or in @xmath51 diffractive production ) is smaller than that observed in @xmath8-scattering .",
    "[ t ]     gev relevant to the cern - isr , the tevatron and the lhc respectively.,height=377 ]    actually to satisfy elastic unitarity it is sufficient to consider an eikonal model which sums up the exchanges of any number of pomerons between the incoming protons .",
    "the model gives a result analogous to ( [ eq : el1 ] ) @xmath52 where , up to a normalization factor , the opacity @xmath53 plays the role of the scattering phase @xmath54 . in the eikonal model , ( [ eq : eik ] ) , it is the opacity @xmath55 which is now described ( or parametrised ) by pomeron exchange , rather than the final amplitude @xmath56 .",
    "the situation is sketched symbolically in fig .",
    "[ fig : epip](a ) .",
    "however this is not the whole story .",
    "the eikonal model does not include events with large rapidity gaps ( lrg ) , arising from the dissociation of one or both of the protons into high - mass systems , which are observed experimentally .",
    "we speak of single or double high - mass diffractive dissociation .",
    "we introduce high - mass dissociation in the next section and give detailed discussion of these lrg events in section [ sec : lrg ] .    before we do this ,",
    "let us recall that the interaction radius ( i.e. the elastic slope ) expected at the lhc will already exceed 1 fm  the distance where _ confinement _ may enter the game .",
    "thus it is possible that confinement will stop the growth of the radius ; that is , the growth of @xmath46 .",
    "another interesting possibility , proposed by v.v.anisovich @xcite , is that the partons ( the gluons and quarks ) in the proton will start to form a few colourless clusters ( like the nucleons in nucleus ) , rather than the normal homogeneous distribution .",
    "this may lead to a rich diffractive dip structure in the differential elastic cross section @xmath57 .",
    "it is an additional argument to study experimentally the @xmath16 behaviour of the elastic cross section at the lhc interval , can be found in @xcite . ] .",
    "so much for elastic scattering , which we may call elastic diffraction .",
    "now we turn to inelastic diffraction , which is a consequence of the _ internal structure _ of the protons . besides the pure elastic two - particle intermediate states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : epip](a ) , there is the possibility of proton excitation , @xmath58 , shown in the small sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig : epip](b ) . at high energies , when the lifetime of the fluctuations of the fast proton is large , @xmath59 , the corresponding fock states can be considered to be ` frozen ' .",
    "each constituent of the proton can undergo scattering and thus destroy the coherence of the fluctuations . as a consequence",
    ", the outgoing superposition of states will be different from the incident particle , so we will have _ inelastic _ , as well as elastic , diffraction .    ; and ( c ) the inclusion of the multi - pomeron - pomeron diagrams which allow for high - mass dissociation .",
    ", height=302 ]    to discuss inelastic diffraction , it is convenient to follow good and walker @xcite , and to introduce states @xmath60 which diagonalize the @xmath56 matrix .",
    "these , so - called diffractive , eigenstates only undergo ` elastic ' scattering .",
    "to account for the internal structure of the proton we , therefore , have to enlarge the set of intermediate states , from just the single elastic channel , and to introduce a multi - channel eikonal . the situation is pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : epip](b ) .",
    "what about proton dissociation into high - mass systems ? at first sight , it appears that we may account for it by simply enlarging the number of diffractive eigenstates @xmath60 .",
    "even if this were practical , we would still face the problem of double counting when partons originating from the dissociation of the beam and the ` target ' protons overlap in rapidities . instead",
    ", high - mass dissociation is described in terms of so - called `` enhanced '' multi - pomeron diagrams .",
    "the first , and simplest , is the triple - pomeron diagram , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt ] and again in fig .",
    "[ fig : epip](c ) .",
    "in fact , high - mass dissociation is much larger than low - mass dissociation at very high energy , and it will play a central role in our discussion of soft interactions . for simplicity , therefore , we do not discuss low - mass dissociation further , but consider that it can be easily allowed for in terms of a multi - channel eikonal .",
    "so , from now on we should regard @xmath61 as an effective opacity embodying low - mass dissociation .",
    "why does high - mass dissociation become so important at high collider energies ?",
    "a simplified way to see this is to note that the cross section for dissociation of a proton into a high - mass ( @xmath62 ) system has the approximate form with @xmath63 . the final equality in ( [ eq : simple ] ) can be deduced by taking the ratio of the couplings indicated in the regge expressions in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt ] . ] _ sd  =  ~  s   _ el , [ eq : simple ] with @xmath64 , where @xmath25 is the triple - pomeron coupling and @xmath24 is the coupling of the pomeron to the proton , see fig .  [ fig : opt ] .",
    "the ln@xmath65 ` rapidity ' factor comes from the integration @xmath66 .",
    "note that here we have used @xmath67 and @xmath68 , see fig  [ fig : opt ] . eq .",
    "( [ eq : simple ] ) is grossly oversimplified .",
    "for one thing , the dissociation cross section is subject to even greater absorptive ( that is , multi - pomeron ) corrections than the elastic cross section .",
    "when these are taken into account it is found from analyses of the available high - energy data that g_3p / g_n  0.25 , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the important point is that the relative size of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 cross sections is governed , not simply by the parameter @xmath71 , but rather by @xmath72 . for each fixed rapidity interval",
    "the probability of high - mass dissociation is relatively small , but the cumulative effect in the complete interaction amplitude is enhanced by the large phase available in rapidity at high collider energies .",
    "in the regge approach , we have seen that high - energy soft interactions are driven by pomeron exchange , together with its absorptive ( multi - pomeron ) corrections .",
    "we may call this the `` soft '' pomeron . note that the @xmath65-channel asymptotic behaviour arising from @xmath16-channel pomeron exchange corresponds to an interaction radius which grows with energy , @xmath73 .",
    "the pomeron must also describe multiparticle interactions .",
    "the sum of ladder diagrams of the type of fig .  [ fig:2](a ) is the simplest multiparticle structure which reproduces the power - like @xmath74 behaviour of the pomeron pole . before the advent of qcd , ladder diagrams composed of @xmath16-channel mesons ( dominantly spinless pion exchange , to the @xmath65-channel physical domain , @xmath75 , due to the smallness of the pion mass . ] ) were summed , and it proved difficult to generate an intercept @xmath76 .    shortly after the discovery of qcd it was noticed @xcite that ( colourless ) two - gluon exchange has the properties of pomeron exchange : vacuum quantum numbers , even signature and a singularity at @xmath77 . due to the polarisation vectors of the spin - one particle ( the gluon ) ,",
    "the numerator of the propagator contains the @xmath78 tensor such that the 4-momenta of the incoming fast protons occur in the form @xmath79 .",
    "therefore the gluon - exchange amplitude contains an extra power of @xmath65 as compared with spinless particle exchange .",
    "later , by applying the regge approach to gluons , rather than to hadrons , it was possible , if the gluon transverse momenta @xmath6 were sufficiently large , to describe high energy ( low @xmath80 ) interactions in terms of perturbative qcd . then , on summing the leading contributions , where the smallness of the qcd coupling @xmath81 is compensated by large values of ln@xmath82 , we build up the `` hard '' pomeron .",
    "below , we briefly trace this history and then apply these ideas to gain insight into high - energy soft interactions .      in terms of regge theory ,",
    "the high - energy amplitude is described by the exchange of a pomeron ( or a few pomerons ) .",
    "as mentioned above , from a quantum field theory viewpoint , the pomeron may be regarded as the sum of ladder - type diagrams , fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) . in other words",
    ", it corresponds to a sum of completely inelastic @xmath83 processes ; that is , to the last term @xmath84 in the unitarity equation ( [ eq : elun ] ) . now let us ` cut ' the pomeron ; see section [ sec : cut ] for further discussion .",
    "that is , we treat the graph of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , not as a diagram for the amplitude , but rather as the diagram for the @xmath83 cross section ( 2n)=a^*(2n)a(2n ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) .",
    "then , we get the inelastic production of @xmath85 particles homogeneously distributed in the available rapidity , @xmath86 , interval .    in the original ` soft ' regge approach",
    "it was assumed that the transverse momenta @xmath6 of these secondaries were limited , and bfkl equation predicts the ` diffusion ' of the gluons in @xmath87 space @xcite . ] .",
    "the original idea , proposed by amati , fubini and stanghellini in 1962 @xcite , was to explain a large high - energy cross section , which did not decrease with energy , as a sequence of interactions in which the energy of a pair of adjacent particles ( pions ) is relatively small and lies in the resonance region where the interaction is strong .",
    "the integration corresponding to each cell of such a ladder is over the rapidity @xmath86 and the transverse momentum @xmath6 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) .",
    "if we denote the momentum transferred through the whole ladder by @xmath88 , then the contribution from a particular cell is @xmath89 where ( q_t^2 )  =   , [ eq : s0 ] and @xmath90 is the coupling .",
    "the integration over the rapidities gives a(y )  =  _ n ^n_i ^y_0 dy_i  =  _ n  =  e^y  =  s^ , where the total rapidity spanned by the ladder @xmath91 , and @xmath92 reflects the identity of the cells or , equivalently , the ordering of the rapidities @xmath93",
    ".     cross section , ( c ) two - pomeron exchange , and ( d , e ) the triple - pomeron contribution to high - mass @xmath62 diffractive dissociation .",
    "the particles that are ` cut ' by the vertical dashed lines in ( b ) and ( c ) are on - mass - shell.,height=143 ]    a convenient alternative way to obtain this result is to consider the evolution equation in rapidity  =  a(y ) .",
    "[ eq : afs ] in such a form @xmath94 plays a role similar to a dglap splitting function .",
    "note that the value of the ` effective spin ' @xmath95 depends on the momentum transfer through the ladder , @xmath96 .",
    "the slope of the pomeron trajectory @xmath97 at @xmath98 is controlled by the mean value of the transverse momenta @xmath99 or , in the case of ( [ eq : s0 ] ) , by the mass @xmath100 of the @xmath16-channel particle .",
    "however , with this procedure it turns out to be practically impossible to obtain a large intercept @xmath101 whilst keeping the @xmath16-channel exchanges to have masses @xmath102 gev .",
    "the corresponding couplings @xmath90 are too small . on the other hand ,",
    "if we include heavier states , then we go to larger @xmath6 ; that is to small distances where it looks reasonable to work in terms of perturbative qcd .      with qcd , the pomeron , at least at small distances ,",
    "is described by the ladder of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) built of gluons , rather than of spinless particles ; with the coupling @xmath103 in ( [ eq : s0 ] ) replaced by the qcd coupling @xmath81 .",
    "the integral over @xmath6 now has a more complicated structure .",
    "it is convenient to consider the recursion relation between the amplitudes @xmath104 with @xmath85 and @xmath105 cells f_n(x ,",
    "k_t )  =  ^1_x  k(k_t , k_t)f_n-1(x,k_t ) , where we keep just the leading ln@xmath106 term in the @xmath107 integration .",
    "note that now we have to account for the dependence of the amplitude on the transverse momenta , @xmath6 , of the @xmath16-channel gluons .",
    "the recursion relation may be rewritten in differential form , as the bfkl evolution equation @xcite  =  kf [ eq : bfkleq ] so that @xmath108 , where  =  n_c_s k /  =   ( t)-1 , where @xmath109 is the leading eigenvalue calculated using equation ( @xmath110 ) below . since we now have spin - one gluons in the ladder , the intercept @xmath111 already in the limit @xmath112 .",
    "in fact , if just the leading ln@xmath82 contributions are summed then , explicitly , @xmath1134ln2 , where @xmath114 @xcite . however , the next - to - leading logarithm ( nll ) contributions are numerically rather large .",
    "it was found @xcite that , accounting these @xmath81 corrections , @xmath115 .",
    "for the relevant , not too small , values of @xmath116 , a resummation is necessary . since the nll contribution is mainly of kinematic origin , it is possible , and looks reasonable , to resum all the major higher - order corrections .",
    "this leads to @xmath117 @xcite in a wide region of @xmath6 .",
    "for simplicity , we consider just the forward amplitude the kernel @xmath118 is a bit more complicated , but qualitatively similar in form . ] with @xmath119 .",
    "then the elastic forward amplitude is a = is  f(x , k_t ) , and , at lo , the bfkl kernel @xmath118 acts as @xmath120 since in qcd we deal with a dimensionless coupling @xmath81 and a massless gluon , the mean value of @xmath6 in each cell is determined by the value of transverse momentum @xmath121 in the previous cell .",
    "this is an important property of the bfkl equation  that is , the so - called diffusion in @xmath122 .",
    "the value of @xmath123 in the current cell may differ from that in the previous cell by some quantity @xmath124 .",
    "in other words , at each step of evolution , not only the impact parameter @xmath7 can be changed by @xmath125 , but also the value of @xmath122 can be changed by @xmath124 .",
    "there are phenomenological hints that at large distances the `` soft '' pomeron should have qualitatively similar structure as the `` hard '' ( qcd ) pomeron .",
    "indeed , first , no irregularity is observed in the hera data in the transition region , @xmath126 , between the ` soft ' and ` hard ' interaction domains ; the data are smooth throughout this region .",
    "second , a small slope @xmath127 of the pomeron trajectory , is obtained in global analyses of all available soft high - energy data , after accounting for absorptive corrections and secondary reggeon contributions .",
    "this indicates that the typical values of @xmath6 inside the pomeron amplitude are relatively large ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "finally , recent `",
    "soft ' model data analyses @xcite which account for the enhanced absorptive effects find an intercept of the initial , bare pomeron @xmath129 close to the intercept of the bfkl pomeron after the nll corrections are resummed @xcite .",
    "thus it looks reasonable to assume that in the soft domain we deal with the same perturbative qcd pomeron ; at least , there is a smooth transition from the soft to the hard pomeron .    in summary ,",
    "the _ bare _ hard pomeron , with a trajectory with intercept @xmath130 and small slope @xmath131 , is subject to increasing absorptive effects as we go to smaller @xmath6 which allow it to smoothly match on to the attributes of the _ soft _ pomeron . in the _ limited _ energy interval up to the tevatron energy , some of these attributes ( specifically those related to the elastic amplitude ) can be mimicked or approximated by an _",
    "effective _ pomeron pole with trajectory intercept @xmath132 and slope @xmath133 .",
    "for further discussion , we write the bfkl evolution equation ( [ eq : bfkleq ] ) in the oversimplified form  =  a(y ) . [ eq : evoleq ] where @xmath134 acts as the splitting function .",
    "this evolution equation is the analogue of ( [ eq : afs ] ) , but , now , the possibility of multiparticle production leads to an additional power growth of the amplitude , @xmath135 , in comparison with the born amplitude , @xmath136 .",
    "in other words , the evolution ( [ eq : evoleq ] ) describes the development of the parton cascade from the ` beam ' proton to the ` target ' proton , and the @xmath137 growth of the inelastic cross section reflects the power growth of the parton density in the cascade .",
    "after one of the partons interacts with the target the coherency of the beam proton wave function is destroyed and a number of secondaries is produced .",
    "note that in the ladder of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) only one branch of the whole cascade is shown , which finally leads to a parton being absorbed by the target .",
    "the number @xmath138 of secondaries produced is equal to the number of steps ( partons ) in this particular branch , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) .",
    "according to ( [ eq : evoleq ] ) , where @xmath139 plays the role of the particle density per unit of rapidity , we have @xmath140 .",
    "on the other hand , each of the partons continue to develop its own cascade .",
    "one example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) , where parton @xmath141 develops its own branch .",
    "however , the branches which were not affected by the target conserve their coherence , and in the final state appear as a single parton .",
    "thus we get the power growth of the amplitude , but only a logarithmic growth of the multiplicity @xmath138 .",
    "the studies of coherence phenomena in a partonic cascade were pioneered by v.n .",
    "gribov in 1972 , see @xcite .",
    "the fact that the coherence of the wave function of the beam proton was destroyed after the interaction with the target , leads not only to inelastic high - multiplicity production , but via unitarity relation ( [ eq : elun ] ) , also to elastic scattering .",
    "elastic scattering is due to the absorption of an initial ( coherent ) component in some domain of the impact parameter @xmath7 plane , and originates from the remaining part of the initial wave function which conserves the coherence between the partons .",
    "that is , elastic scattering occurs as the ` shadow ' of the inelastic interaction . if the inelastic contribution @xmath37 is represented by the single ladder of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) , then the elastic contribution may be drawn as a ` cut ' between the two pomerons of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) , see also fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "so much for elastic scattering of the incoming proton .",
    "however , an intermediate parton in a ladder may be scattered elastically as well . a unitarity equation , analogous to ( [ eq : elun ] ) , may , and should be , written for any intermediate parton .",
    "the elastic scattering of an intermediate parton @xmath141 can be represented by the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](d ) . here , both branches of the cascade which start to evolve from parton @xmath141 save their coherence .",
    "therefore in the final state we will have a large rapidity gap between the parton @xmath141 and the target .",
    "such a process is called the diffractive dissociation of the beam proton into a high - mass state @xmath62 .",
    "it is described by the triple - pomeron diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](e ) , in which one pomeron is split into two pomerons , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : opt ] .",
    "the probability @xmath142 of this splitting within a unit rapidity interval is relatively small .",
    "first , due to the small parton @xmath141 density @xmath139 , where @xmath139 arises from ( [ eq : evoleq ] ) .",
    "next , due to the parton-(target ) proton cross section being smaller than the proton - proton cross section , since the incoming proton contains many partons . on the other hand ,",
    "each intermediate parton in the ladder may generate a pomeron splitting .",

    "two main scenarios were proposed to prevent such a growth and to restore unitarity .",
    "first , the so - called _ weak _ coupling scenario assumes that the triple - pomeron vertex @xmath154 ( and correspondingly the value of @xmath150 ) vanishes as @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "since the mean value of momentum transfer @xmath156 decreases as @xmath157 ( the shrinkage of the diffractive cone ) the decrease of @xmath147 compensates the increase of the available rapidity interval .",
    "however this hypothesis is not supported by experiment region to confirm this conclusion ; see @xcite . ] .",
    "in the favoured _ strong _ coupling scenario @xcite , the multi - gap cross section is suppressed by a small ` gap survival probability ' @xmath10 which decreases with energy . in this case",
    "the pomeron coupling @xmath158 as @xmath155 , while the small probability of lrg production is due to the large probability that the gaps are populated by secondaries produced in additional soft rescattering interactions between the protons ( and also the intermediate partons ) .    in the simple eikonal model , ( [ eq : eik ] ) , the probability , not to have an additional inelastic interaction which will populate the gap , is given by a factor @xmath159 .",
    "recall that in the eikonal model @xmath84 .",

    "indeed , we have possibility to cut any number of pomerons . cutting @xmath85 pomerons",
    "we get an event with multiplicity @xmath85 times larger than that generated by one pomeron .",

    "for a low optical density @xmath191 the correlation arises mainly from the two - pomeron exchange diagram , and increases as @xmath192 . at very large @xmath61 ,",

    "when we have _ enhanced _ diagrams , that is pomeron loops which produce lrg which occupy only a part @xmath196 of the rapidity space , the corresponding correlation takes place only within this @xmath196 interval .",

    "such a behaviour is expected in a theory with only the triple - pomeron coupling , and which neglects the more complicated multi - pomeron vertices , such as the @xmath198 pomeron coupling and so on @xcite .",
    "recall that the two - pomeron loop gives a positive probability for lrg production but its contribution to the amplitude is negative , see fig .",

    "we obtain the ` dressed ' propagator in terms of a schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "the intercept of the final ` dressed ' propagator is @xmath199 . with increasing energy , the available rapidity interval increases , with the result that the loop renormalisation grows and hence the effective intercept @xmath200 decreases .",

    "the loop contribution , @xmath202 , is calculated using the dressed pomeron propagator , and the factor @xmath203 comes from the integral over the loop size @xmath196 .    for the reasonable values @xmath204 and @xmath117 , the naive estimate based on ( [ eq : sd ] ) gives @xmath205 .",
    "that is @xmath206 .",
    "this means that up to a rather large energy ( @xmath207 ) the total cross section will grow , but after this , that is just in the lhc region , it will start to decrease . for multiparticle production , such a regime will reveal itself as long - range rapidity fluctuations of the multiplicity arising from two - pomeron loops which may produce either lrg or a double multiplicity of secondaries in the rapidity domain occupied by the loop .",
    "let us return to the simplified eikonal model ( [ eq : eik ] ) , written for the partons in the incoming protons .",
    "we may ask the question - `` what happens to an incoming fast quark ? '' on the one hand , the factor @xmath208 describes its absorption .",

    "disappearance from the incoming beam ( wave function ) actually means _",
    "migration _  after the collision the momentum of quark is changed . in the leading logarithmic approximation",
    ", the quark mainly changes its transverse momentum .",
    "each new pomeron - quark coupling may be considered as a new elastic scattering and it is known that after @xmath85 scatterings the mean transverse momentum squared , @xmath209 , increases @xmath85 times .",
    "thus , when we say that unitarity stops the growth of the parton density via an increase of the absorptive correction , actually we mean that the extra partons produced by the cascade are pushed out of the previous domain in @xmath210 configuration space into a region of larger @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "accounting for the enhanced diagrams we get the same phenomena , not only for the incoming fast partons ( as in the eikonal model ) , but for any intermediate partons as well .",
    "thus finally we expect that the particle density will reach saturation at low @xmath6 , but will continue to grow with energy at larger @xmath6",
    ". therefore , at higher energies a larger number of minijets with larger @xmath211 will be produced .",
    "due to saturation in the low @xmath6 region at very high energies , the majority of partons will have rather large @xmath6 .",
    "we already know that the diffusion in @xmath87 takes place in the perturbative qcd domain @xcite , and to provide a smooth matching to the larger @xmath6 domain we need to include some elements of a similar diffusion in the description of low ( and intermediate ) transverse momenta .",
    "at the tevatron and the lhc , there is a possibility to study just pomeron - pomeron collisions by selecting events with large rapidity gaps on either side of some centrally produced hadronic system of mass @xmath62 .",
    "this can be done , either , by detecting the two forward outgoing protons which each carry a large fraction , @xmath212 , of their incoming momenta and the size of the gaps in rapidity are @xmath213 .",
    "] , say @xmath214 , or , just by using the `` gap - hadron - gap '' trigger .",
    "since the interaction across each gap is described by pomeron exchange such events may be treated as pomeron - pomeron collisions .",
    "usually it is called a double - pomeron - exchange ( dpe ) process .    in a dpe process",
    "we may hope to observe the properties of the pomeron caused by the fact that ( i ) the pomeron consists mainly of gluons and ( ii ) the transverse size of the pomeron is small , that is the typical transverse momenta , @xmath6 , in the diagrams which describe pomeron exchange are relatively large . indeed , the value of @xmath6 increases due to bfkl diffusion and screening effects ( as explained in the previous section ) . another indication in favour of large @xmath6 is the rather small value of the slope @xmath215 of the pomeron trajectory , see section [ sec : trans ] and the discussion after eq.([eq : afs ] ) .    for these reasons ,",
    "dpe events have several characteristic features .",
    "first , since the pomeron consists of mainly of gluons , we expect there to be a larger fraction of the glueballs and/or @xmath216 mesons in the central system @xmath217 , than that in @xmath8-interactions . recall that su(3 ) iso - singlet @xmath216 mesons contain a sizeable gluon component .",
    "moreover , because dpe has no `` incoming '' valence quarks , we expect the baryon / hyperon content to be smaller than in @xmath8 interactions .",
    "further information can be obtained by comparing dpe processes with @xmath8 interactions at the lower energy @xmath218 .",
    "for example , the multiplicity of secondaries is expected to be close to that in the @xmath8 case interactions , since there the multiplicity , and other characteristics of the final distribution , are driven by specific double loagarithms which are different from those in @xmath8 collisions @xcite . ] .",
    "strictly speaking , we expect a bit higher multiplicity since in pomeron - pomeron collisions the initial energy goes mainly to mesons , while the fraction of baryons is smaller than in @xmath8 interactions .",
    "there are several consequences of the small size of the pomeron .",
    "first , the transverse momenta of secondaries are expected to be a bit larger for dpe than that in the @xmath8 case at @xmath219 , but smaller ( due to the kinematic constraints ) than in the original pure inelastic process which takes up the whole initial @xmath8 energy @xmath5 .",
    "the high @xmath220 dijets produced by dpe will be dominantly gluon jets .",
    "next , the relatively small size of the pomeron should result in a smaller interaction radius , as measured via bose - einstein correlations , than that found in the usual inelastic @xmath8 collision . finally , the probability of double parton scattering , in particular the probability to observe two pairs of high @xmath220 jets , will be larger than that in a @xmath8 collision at @xmath219 .",
    "accounting for the anticipated lhc luminosity , the rate of dpe events is rather large .",
    "for example , from ref .",
    "@xcite , we see that the dpe cross section integrated over the @xmath221 interval , corresponding to the central production of a system of mass @xmath222 100 gev , is about 10 @xmath223 .",
    "alternatively , the expected dpe cross section is @xmath224  @xcite ; here @xmath225 .",
    "so it should be possible to study the properties of dpe events in detail .",
    "we should discuss how the saturation of particle densities can be consistent with confinement .",
    "the growth of the transverse momenta @xmath6 tames the increase of the interaction radius with energy .",
    "one possibility is that the simultaneous action of confinement and the growth of @xmath6 will finally lead to the saturation of the interaction radius ; that is to the saturation of the elastic slope , @xmath226 as @xmath227 .",
    "however the idea , discussed at the end of section [ sec : tot ] , that when the interaction radius becomes large confinement leads to the formation of colourless clusters , allows an alternative possibility . in a large , but finite , interval of rapidity",
    "the evolution is driven by the gluon ladder . in this case",
    "the impact parameter is almost frozen ; that is , the variation of the interaction radius @xmath228 is small .",
    "the system then emits a pion ( or another meson ) and this ` colourless cluster ' provides a noticeable increase of the impact parameter @xmath7 . following this , we again have gluons in some interval of evolution , and so on , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m](a ) .",
    "the hard qcd interactions will be responsible for the growth of @xmath6 , while the part of the evolution described in terms of colourless mesons will be responsible for the increase in the interaction radius , that is of @xmath46 , due to the diffusion in * b * plane see fig . [",
    "fig : m](b ) .",
    "in such a ` mixed ' picture we expect lower @xmath6 in peripheral collisions ( since the available rapidity interval was used to enlarge the value of @xmath7 ) and maximal @xmath6 in central collisions .",
    "[ t ]        it may be informative to study multiparticle production at the lhc for individual events , as well as in terms of inclusive cross sections . at the high lhc energy the multiplicity of secondaries is large .",
    "thus it might be possible to observe the fluctuation of particle densities in individual events like those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] , or the effects arising from a mixture of intervals of evolution via colourless meson and coloured gluon exchanges , like those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m ] . in the latter case",
    ", the rapidity correlation length ( measured via @xmath185 of ( [ eq : r2 ] ) ) should be rather small for peripheral collisions since the main part of the available rapidity interval was used for meson exchange ( to enlarge @xmath7 ) and so only small intervals are left for gluon exchange where we expect a large probability to have several ` cut ' pomerons .",
    "it is appropriate to say a few final words about models of high - energy soft interactions .",
    "we emphasize that the aim of experiment is not to reject or to confirm one or another model by saying that the data prefer monte carlo version x or y. rather , the objective should be to isolate , and to study , the main qualitative features of the interaction .",

    "the multi - pomeron absorptive effects tame the power growth of the @xmath8 total cross section leading to values smaller than predicted before .",

    "fig : kmr](a ) . at 100 tev",
    "the prediction of 108 mb is at the lower limit of cosmic ray expectations .",
    "* simultaneously , these absorptive effects shrink the elastic differential cross section peak as the energy increases through the lhc range more than the expectations arising from a naive effective pomeron - pole of a donnachie - landshoff type of parametrization @xcite .",
    "* the cross section for proton dissociation into high - mass systems should grow with energy and be comparable to the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "the reason is that although , for each fixed rapidity interval , the probability of high - mass dissociation is relatively small , the overall effect is enhanced by the large phase space that is available in rapidity at high collider energies .",
    "the predicted values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 for the kmr multi - pomeron model are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : kmr](b , c ) for energies in the tevatron  lhc energy range . * the main growth in multiplicity , as we go from tevatron to lhc energies , is due to the small size ( ` qcd ' ) pomeron component , which produces particles with typically @xmath231 gev .",
    "there is essentially no growth in multiplicity at small @xmath232 .",
    "this simply confirms the trend that has been observed through the cern - isr to tevatron energy range , see the data points in fig .",

    "such behaviour is consistent with the experiment ( see fig .  [",

    "this process , with @xmath237higgs , is a novel and promising way to study the higgs sector at the lhc , which gives a strong motivation for the addition of forward proton detectors to enhance the discovery and physics potential of the atlas and cms detectors at the lhc @xcite .",
    "already , at the tevatron , the cdf collaboration have observed exclusive processes with @xmath238 , dijet and @xmath239 with rates consistent with the estimates of the lrg survival probabilities predicted by the multi - pomeron model of soft interactions , see @xcite and references therein",
    ". more data on exclusive processes , from both the tevatron and , especially , the lhc , will be illuminating .",
