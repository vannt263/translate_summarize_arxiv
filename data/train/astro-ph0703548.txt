    "a molecule whose emission line luminosity is linearly related to the rate of star formation in a galaxy would be useful to the study of star formation and the evolution of galaxies since the emission can be used to directly and simply relate the star formation rate to physical properties of the ism .",
    "the dust continuum emission in the far - infrared ( fir ) , re - radiated from dust heated by uv radiation from young massive stars , is a good indicator of the actual star formation rate .",
    "a molecular line tracer of star formation can be imaged at sub - arcsecond resolution and analyzed for the morphology and kinematics of the star - forming gas , whereas measurements of the fir lack comparable spatial resolution .",
    "emission in the rotational lines of carbon monoxide is the cardinal indicator of the presence of molecular gas in galaxies , seen from the interstellar medium of the milky way to quasars at redshifts up to @xmath3 ( see solomon and vanden bout 2005 , for a review of the properties of the @xmath4 galaxies with co emission detected at @xmath5 ) .",
    "co emission is strong from star - forming giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the galaxy and external galaxies .",
    "and the fir luminosity , a measure of the star formation rate , is directly proportional to co luminosity for gmcs and normal spirals , but increases more rapidly than linearly with co luminosity for luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs & ulirgs , see sanders and mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "gao and solomon ( 2004a , hereafter gs04a ) find a slope of 1.7 over 3 orders of magnitude in luminosity for the   ",
    "correlation including all of the co observations of ulirgs from solomon ( 1997 ) .",
    "thus for extreme starbursts such as ulirgs the star formation rate per solar mass of total molecular gas traced by co , a measure of the star formation efficiency , is much higher than for normal spirals .",
    "in contrast to the fir  co correlation , the fir ",
    "hcn correlation is a linear relation over three decades in hcn luminosity from normal spirals to ulirgs ( gs04a ) .",
    "this is based upon the hcn survey of 65 galaxies , including nearly 10 ulirgs and more than 20 lirgs ( gao & solomon 2004b ; solomon , downes , and radford 1992 ) .",
    "indeed , wu ( 2005 ) have shown that the fir ",
    "hcn correlation for galaxies extends down to individual dense cores in the star - forming gmcs in the milky way , spanning over eight decades in hcn luminosity .",
    "the key point is that hcn emission traces the gas actually undergoing star formation which is @xmath6 100 times denser than that traced by co and the star formation rate is linearly proportional to the mass of dense gas with approximately n(2 ) @xmath7 @xmath8 ( solomon , downes , & radford 1992 ; gs04a ) the work reported here addresses the question of whether this linear fir ",
    "hcn correlation , well - established for galaxies with redshifts @xmath9 , extends to emgs at high-@xmath2 .",
    "previous to this work , there were four high-@xmath2   detections of hcn ( solomon 2003 ; vanden bout 2004 ; carilli 2005 ; wagg 2005 ) together with upper limits to five others ( isaak 2004 ; carilli 2005 ; greve 2006 ) .",
    "the fir / hcn ratios for these galaxies are all systematically offset from an extrapolation of the fir ",
    "hcn relation for nearby normal spirals , lirgs , and ulirgs . because an accurate molecular line tracer of star formation in emgs is of great interest , it is important to know whether the emgs truly lie above the fir ",
    "hcn correlation observed for @xmath9 or not .",
    "the four high-@xmath2  detections and upper limits on 5 others lie at the limits of current telescope capabilities and the error bars can only be reduced with great expenditure of integration time .",
    "in addition , all four hcn detections at high redshift are quasars where the dust - enshrouded agn contribution to the fir emission could be significant .",
    "we attempted to increase the number of high-@xmath2  hcn detections by observing two submillimeter galaxies , neither with an embedded agn , and two more quasars with known strong co emission .",
    "the galaxies selected for hcn(1 - 0 ) , rest frequency @xmath10=88.63185 ghz , observations were four emgs from the compilation of solomon and vanden bout ( 2005 ) that had the strongest co emission following that of those previously detected in hcn emission .",
    "in addition , their redshifted hcn lines fell into an observing band of the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the observations were carried out in the d configuration of the vla in 2005 october and december for a total of 54 hours .",
    "a summary of the sources , observing times and observed frequencies is given in table 1 .",
    "the lowest redshift source in our sample , a submillimeter ( smg ) galaxy , smm j02396 - 0134 at @xmath11 , was observed with the vla 40 - 50 ghz receiver system in the 50 mhz continuum mode , which has two intermediate frequencies ( ifs ) of two polarizations each .",
    "observations were made with two if settings to provide the bandwidth required to cover the expected hcn line , as the co line width is over 700   broad .",
    "this provided four independent channels of 350 km s@xmath12 each , two covering the expected hcn line and one each above and below the hcn line for a measurement of the continuum .",
    "the redshifted hcn lines for other three sources fell in the vla 21 - 25 ghz receiver system .",
    "these sources have co line widths from 340 to 500   ( 25 to 37 mhz ) . we observed these sources in the vla 2ac mode with 7 channels of width 3.125 mhz ( 40 ) in each of the consecutive if pair , providing a total of @xmath6550  velocity coverage .",
    "standard vla data reductions were performed in aips . and hcn channel maps were obtained for each target with the aips task ` imagr ' .",
    "a summary of the observations and results is given in table 2 .",
    "no significant hcn emission was seen in any of the targets except for the weak line at 4@xmath13 in smm j16359 + 6612 ( hereafter j16359 ) , the other smg in the sample .",
    "we obtained the velocity - integrated moment - zero map for each target by integrating over the channel maps covering the expected hcn line width , assumed to be the same as that of co , leaving out the edge channels .",
    "the smg j16359 shows weak but significant hcn emission at the strongest co position ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the rms noise levels from these moment - zero maps were used to calculate the 3@xmath0 upper limits to the velocity - integrated hcn flux in the three undetected sources .",
    "figure 1 presents the hcn image of j16359 .",
    "the smg j16359 has three widely separated lensed components detected in co ( kneib 2005 ) .",
    "we see a weak hcn signal at 3@xmath0 in the strongest of these co lens components . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , we extracted three hcn images of size @xmath14 centered at the centroids ( crosses ) of each of the three co lensed image components in fig .",
    "1 . the inset image is a weighted average of these three hcn images .",
    "the ( weighted ) average hcn image shows a 4@xmath0 signal at the strongest co position .",
    "this hcn source is barely resolved as a double source with a separation of @xmath1 .",
    "there is also a 3@xmath0 hcn signal @xmath15 ne at the location of the second strongest co lens component .",
    "the reality of this tentative hcn detection in the component - averaged image of j16359 is further supported by the following features evident in the co and hcn morphologies / kinematics :    \\1 . the hcn emission maxima ( @xmath16 ) are exactly at the centroids of the two strongest lensed co components . and",
    "the strongest co centroid is located in the middle of the double hcn components separated by @xmath1 .",
    "the location , orientation , and separation of the hcn double - source are also consistent with those of inferred co kinematics / morphology though the co emission is spatially unresolved .",
    "they are also possibly associated with the optical features both spatially and kinematically ( kneib 2005 ) .",
    "further indirect evidence for a merger origin of j16359 has been summarized by wei   ( 2005 ) . although high resolution co and high sensitivity hcn imaging is required to directly reveal the putative merging morphology ( or extended @xmath6  2 kpc edge - on dense gas ring / disk ) , the stacked hcn image",
    "provides the first direct evidence of a double - source in dense star - forming gas .",
    "we note that a double - source distribution in a lens image needs not imply the same distribution in the original object .",
    "combining all hcn observations at high - redshift , including upper limits , yields a total of five hcn detections and eight upper limits , shown in table 3 .",
    "this sample contains four smgs .",
    "we note that all of the hcn luminosities in table 3 are for the ( 1 - 0 ) line .",
    "hcn luminosities are calculated ( solomon 2003 ) from @xmath17 , in k pc@xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the velocity integrated hcn line flux in jy , and @xmath20 is the luminosity distance in mpc .",
    "the hcn , co , and fir luminosities for our sample , are given in table 3 , together with the lens magnification that was assumed in correcting apparent to intrinsic luminosities .    in figures 2 - 4",
    "we show plots of fir vs. hcn luminosity , the fir / co ratio vs. the hcn / co luminosity ratio , and fir luminosity vs. the hcn / co ratio , respectively , for the 13 high-@xmath2  galaxies of table 3 together with those of a sample of 65 galaxies from the local hcn survey ( gs04a ) .",
    "the five measurements and eight upper - limits to the hcn luminosities in the high-@xmath2  emgs shown in figures 2 and 3 , have systematically somewhat larger fir luminosities than predicted by an extrapolation of the correlation that applies to local normal spirals , lirgs , and ulirgs .",
    "this hints at a slight deviation from linearity above a fir luminosity  @xmath21   that is similar to the much larger non  linearity of the fir ",
    "co correlation particularly for lirgs and ulirgs with  @xmath22 .",
    "the local sample has an average ratio /  @xmath23 750 / k pc@xmath18  for all 65 galaxies over a range of luminosity from 2 @xmath24 to 2 @xmath25 .",
    "the ulirgs in the sample which have fir luminosities  @xmath26   ( @xmath27  ) , have an average ratio of 880 with a 1@xmath0 dispersion of @xmath28 / k pc@xmath18  .",
    "these are the closest analogs to the emgs .",
    "two of the high-@xmath2  hcn detections ( cloverleaf and smm j16359 ) lead to /values within the range expected from nearby galaxies , similar to the ratio in the best known ulirg arp  220 with /  @xmath23 1340 / k pc@xmath18  .",
    "the three other detections have ratios about twice that of arp 220 .",
    "only three of the 65 local galaxies have ratios in this range ( 2200 @xmath29 2600 ) .",
    "four measurements yield high upper limits to / , outside the distribution expected from local galaxies including ulirgs .",
    "there are also three weak upper limits that are not very useful .",
    "combining the detections and upper limits , the star formation rate per solar mass of dense gas , measured by / , is higher in emgs than in the local universe , including ulirgs , by a factor of about 2.0  2.5 .",
    "it should be noted that with the exception of four smgs , including the hcn detection reported here , all other emgs in our sample host known agn . were the fir luminosities of these emgs to be corrected by the amount contributed by their agn",
    ", the points plotted would , in principle , come into better agreement with the low-@xmath2  correlation .",
    "however , for the three quasars where the corrections have been calculated ( f10214 + 4724 , downes 2004 ; cloverleaf , wei  2003 ; apm  08279 + 5255 , ( wei  2005 , 2007 ) the corrections are significant only for apm  08279 , a highly luminous ir source with an unususal hot dust component ( 200k ) connected with the qso .",
    "note , here we have used the rest frame fir for all galaxies , local and high-@xmath2 , instead of the ir luminosity that was used in gs04a for the local hcn sample .    table 3 and fig .",
    "4 show that the ratio /  for the emgs is similar to that found in the local ulirg population with the highest /  @xmath30 and an average of 0.19 ( for 5 detections ) compared with a maximum of 0.26 and an average of 0.13 for local ulirgs .",
    "if we leave out apm  08279 the highest emg value is 0.19 and the average is 0.13 .",
    "normal spiral galaxies have an average ratio of 0.03 .",
    "thus emgs and ulirgs have in common a high fraction of dense molecular gas compared to total molecular gas .",
    "all of the emgs meet the luminous starburst criteria ( fig .",
    "4 ) found by gs04a . kohno ( 2005 ) claimed that nearby agn tend to have exceptionally high hcn / co ratios , presumably due to the x - ray dominated regions near agn .",
    "but we did not find any similar cases in the agn - dominated emg sample at high-@xmath2 as their hcn / co ratios are comparable to that of local ulirgs ( fig .",
    "hcn observations of the local host galaxies of infrared - excess palomar - green qsos also show that there is no evidence that the global hcn emission is enhanced relative to co in galaxies hosting luminous agn ( evans 2006 ) .",
    "in conclusion we find that the emgs have large quantities of dense molecular gas with hcn luminosities on average higher than local ulirgs .",
    "they also have a high dense gas mass fraction , similar to ulirgs .",
    "but , on average , they have a higher star formation rate per unit dense molecular gas than ulirgs or local normal large spirals .",
    "significant progress requires the power of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , which will dramatically increase both the sample size and the quality of the measurements , to obtain rotational ladders , refine density estimates , and test other molecules such as hco@xmath31 , hnc , cs , etc . , for measuring the physical properties of dense star - forming gas at high-@xmath2 .",
