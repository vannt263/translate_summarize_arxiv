    "time - resolved spectroscopy has been employed extensively to investigate the dynamic properties of materials with strong correlations , e.g. , ( quasi-)one - dimensional ( 1d ) mott insulators such as bis(ethylendithyo)-tetrathiafulvalene - difluorotetracyanoquinodimethane et - f@xmath0tcnq  @xcite and halogen - bridged transition - metal compounds  @xcite , as well as correlated systems with higher space dimensions , such as cuprates  @xcite and manganites  @xcite . as a promising time - resolved spectroscopy technique ,",
    "ultrafast pump - probe optical measurement is able to unravel the complicated entanglement of various degrees of freedom in a correlated system to some extent by resolving their contributions separately at multiple time scales  @xcite . for experiments on electronic systems ,",
    "time - resolved optical conductivity is an essential quantity , from which the dynamic properties of charges and other related degrees of freedom can be analyzed ; see the discussions in refs .  .",
    "generally , in order to calculate a dynamic response function , the corresponding correlation functions at different times should be obtained . in nonequilibrium ,",
    "the task becomes more demanding since the system is evolving and the time - translation invariance is absent .",
    "consequently , the correlation functions with two time variables can not be reduced to functions with only one time variable , i.e. , the temporal distance in the case of equilibrium .",
    "theoretically , there are various ways in microscopic model calculations to describe the dynamic response of correlated systems in nonequilibrium . one possible way is based on the nonequilibrium green s functions : by using the kadanoff - baym or keldysh formalism , methods that have been applied to correlated systems in equilibrium , such as dynamic mean - field theory , can be adapted to nonequilibrium on a formal level ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "another method begins with wave functions ; this method is used primarily within closed systems .",
    "the time - dependent wave functions can be secured using various numerical methods , such as exact diagonalization and the density - matrix renormalization - group method .",
    "thereafter , the time - dependent expectation values of observables and various temporal correlations can be readily obtained , which enables further calculations on the out - of - equilibrium dynamic response .",
    "specifically , with regard to time - dependent optical conductivity , several related but different schemes have been employed in similar models , including the nonequilibrium generalizations of the kubo formula  @xcite , linear - response theory  @xcite , or a direct calculation on dynamic current - current correlations for transient states  @xcite .",
    "however , the underlying characters and validity of these approaches have not yet been fully addressed as far as we know .",
    "this is also a practical problem for the purpose of analyzing data from ( sub-)thz spectroscopy measurements , where the temporal resolution has been pushed up to the order of a few tens of femtoseconds  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we suggest that the way in which temporal correlations are incorporated can be crucial in the study of nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "inspired by the pump - probe setup in the experiments , we propose a method to calculate the optical conductivity .",
    "its validity and limits are demonstrated via detailed numerical simulations on the 1d half - filled extended hubbard model , a prototype of strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "a comparison between our method and the existing ones shows that by adopting two different limits on the probe pulse , our method can reproduce the results of two types of linear - response theory .",
    "we note that in some nonequilibrium situations , the two sets of results on the time - dependent optical conductivity can be quite different . theoretical analysis combined with numerical simulations elucidates the difference and connections between these various methods to a satisfactory level .",

    "we argue that the nlr method , which has been derived rigorously from linear - response theory  @xcite , contains more complete information about the temporal correlations than vnlr ( or equivalently nkf ) _ with respect to the definition of @xmath35 in eq .",

    "inspired by the experimental pump - probe setup and the theoretical works on the coherent dynamics in the bcs model  @xcite , we propose a method to calculate the optical conductivity of the hubbard model both in and out of equilibrium as follows .",
    "first , one notes that an external spatially homogeneous electric field applied along the chain in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be incorporated via the peierls substitution in the hopping terms as  @xcite : @xmath52 with the knowledge of the wave function @xmath53 under the action of @xmath54 , the temporal evolution of the expectation value of the current operator @xmath55 , defined as @xmath56 , can be readily obtained .",
    "note that with the existence of @xmath54 , the current operator @xmath30 becomes time dependent : @xmath57 .",
    "\\label{eq:13}\\ ] ]    in equilibrium , we set the vector potential @xmath54 to be a weak probe pulse denoted as @xmath58 , and the current induced by it as @xmath59 . here",
    "the time - dependent wave function @xmath43 describes the time evolution of the system under the influence of @xmath58 starting from the ground state .",
    "identical to eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.5 ] ) , the optical conductivity can then be calculated by @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the fourier transformations of @xmath59 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "note that numerically , a damping factor @xmath63 is also introduced when the fourier transformations are performed , as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) . the same @xmath33 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) is necessary to distinguish the drude component in the spectral weight at @xmath64 , which will be discussed later in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] .",
    "it is worth to stress here that eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) can be regarded as a practical definition of the conductivity in equilibrium : @xmath21 obtained in this way does not depend on the details of the probing field we choose , which has been verified in the numerical simulations .",
    "we are now in the position to generalize the algorithm to nonequilibrium , where the system can be driven either by a pump pulse or a quench .",
    "the key is that in order to identify the response of the system with respect to the later probe pulse , a subtraction is necessary , i.e. , two successive steps are involved ( each step follows a similar process to that described above ) in order to calculate the optical conductivity in nonequilibrium  @xcite .",
    "first , a time - evolution process that describes the nonequilibrium development of the system in the absence of a probe pulse is evaluated , and we obtain @xmath55 . secondly , in the presence of an additional probe pulse , we get @xmath65 .",
    "the subtraction of @xmath55 from @xmath65 produces the required @xmath59 , i.e. , the variation of the current expectations due to the presence of the probe pulse . then analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) , the optical conductivity in nonequilibrium is proposed to be @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the probing time .",
    "this pump - probe - based method is abbreviated as pp .",
    "the main reason for considering the pp method seriously is that for us it seems to be a reasonable numerical approach to the ultrafast spectroscopy experiments .",
    "a few final words are in order regarding the numerical method : to trace the temporal evolution of the system , we employ the time - dependent lanczos method to evaluate @xmath68 .",
    "the key formula is @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the tridiagonal matrix generated in the lanczos iteration , respectively , @xmath72 is the dimension of the lanczos basis , and @xmath73 is the minimum time step .",
    "more details of the algorithm can be found in ref .  .",
    "in the pp method , analogous to experiments , it is important that the strength of the probe pulse should be weak enough not to disturb the system s dynamics qualitatively .",
    "meanwhile , the influence of the forms of the probe pulse is also crucial in nonequilibrium .",
    "this point will be made clear in the following arguments .",
    "we begin with the specific form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) in 1d : @xmath74 where we have assumed that the probe electric field is turned on after @xmath75 with the restriction of @xmath76 .",
    "the fourier transformation on @xmath77 gives @xmath78 e_{\\text{probe}}(t'')e^{i\\omega t''}\\,{\\mathrm{d}}t''\\nonumber   \\\\ = & { \\int_{t_0}^{t_m}}\\sigma(\\omega , t'')e_{\\text{probe}}(t'')e^{i\\omega t''}\\,{\\mathrm{d}}t '' , \\label{eq:18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the maximum evolution time and @xmath80 .",
    "we can see that in order to obtain @xmath35 [ assuming @xmath81 , and in this section we use @xmath18 to denote the probing time ] , the most convenient choice of @xmath82 in theory is a @xmath83 pulse with the form of @xmath84 , and the desired @xmath35 is simply proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "the strategy is different from the usual treatment for equilibrium in the textbooks , e.g. , in ref .  , where a monochromatic perturbation field @xmath85 is applied from @xmath86 . in the temporal gauge , the favorable @xmath83 electric field corresponds to a step - like vector potential , i.e. , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the heaviside step function ( the effect of ramping , i.e. , the gradual increase of @xmath89 from zero to a finite value , instead of a jump , will be discussed later in this section ) .",
    "we call this kind of pp way with a step - like vector potential a pp - step . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:18 ] ) it is easy to convince oneself that under the step potential , eq .  ( [ eq:15 ] ) exactly produces @xmath35 in nlr .",
    "this means that by applying step - like vector potentials at time @xmath18 , we can extract the exact value of @xmath35 by simply looking at the time evolution of the induced current @xmath59 .",
    "thus the connection between pp - step and nlr can be established .",
    "this proposition will be verified by later numerical simulations .",
    "however , in the ultrafast spectroscopy measurements , thz ac probe pulses , which usually come from the same source of pump pulses , are employed instead of electric @xmath83-like fields .",

    "it requires a narrow probe pulse , i.e. , @xmath91 should be small enough for nonequilibrium in order to obtain @xmath35 .",

    "the reason is as follows : in pp - gaussian , the incoming photon frequency is broadened into a gaussian - like distribution , with the variance of @xmath110 around @xmath92 ; in order to cover a large enough @xmath111-regime , a sufficiently small @xmath91 is preferred .",
    "this observation explains the large deviation for @xmath112 at low frequencies when @xmath92 is set to be @xmath113 in fig .",

    "the blue solid lines represent the results of the vnlr in the left column ( ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) ) and nlr in the right column ( ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) ) , respectively , while the red dashed lines represent the results of the pp - gaussian and pp - step in the two columns . the insets in the left column display the details in the vicinity of @xmath23 obtained by nkf , vnlr and pp - gaussian .",
    "model parameters : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath144.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    figure  [ fig5 ] shows the results of @xmath145 at @xmath140 for these three setups with various methods . first note that the nkf method only includes the regular part of the current - current correlation term ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) ) . as a result",
    ", @xmath145 equals to zero at @xmath23 exactly .",
    "away from the vicinity of @xmath23 , the results of the nkf and vnlr are consistent .",
    "this is not surprising since the nkf is just about the regular part of vnlr .",
    "more importantly , from fig .  [ fig5 ] , we can see that in all three cases , including pump and quench , the results between pp - gaussian and vnlr ( left column ) and pp - step and nlr ( right column ) coincide well with each other . thus the proposition in the previous section of the equivalence among these groups is verified numerically .",
    "we make it clear that the nkf and nlr , as being widely used in the dynamic response study , actually correspond to different limits of the probe in the pp method , which either has a gaussian - like vector potential with a vanishing width , or a steplike one .",
    "the former with a tiny width as small as @xmath101 actually can be regarded as an approximation of the temporal @xmath83-like potential , which has been numerically confirmed in our calculations ( not shown here ) .",
    "though the electric fields are both highly temporally confined in these two cases , one essential difference is the persistence ( or temporal locality in the opposite sense ) of the vector potential in the subsequent time evolutions , which results in the ( non)vanishing of the time integral of the electric field over the probing time .",
    "a possible implication of the above observations is that the time - dependent conductivity or other similar transport quantities in nonequilibrium obtained in experimental measurements , might depend on the details of the probe if the features of the measuring procedures are essentially described by the pp method .",
    "theoretical investigations should take into account the relevant experimental setup sufficiently . in the present thz spectroscopy measurements ,",
    "the duration time of probe pulses is usually hundreds of times larger than the microscopic time unit , which may vindicate the approximation of pp - step or nlr , where the characteristic duration time of the probe is much longer than the time scale of the dynamics in which we are interested  @xcite .",
    "conversely , i.e. , if the probe time scale is much smaller than the latter , vnlr or pp - gaussian might be a good starting point for analysis",
    ".    it may be worthwhile to make some supplementary comments on the physics in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] before closing the section , though it is not the main subject of the present study . in the pump case , a prominent drude - like structure of the transient conductivity in the low - frequency regime can be observed , associated with the suppression of the main absorption peak around @xmath146 .",
    "it is a typical phenomenon due to photoinduced carriers .",
    "more discussions on this issue in terms of this model can be found , e.g. , in ref .  .",
    "the @xmath138-quench corresponds to a population inversion in the kinetic energy  @xcite , where a temporally enhancement of charge mobility is also observed .",
    "the @xmath9-quench is one of the examples of interaction quench  @xcite . in our case , with @xmath9 being switched from @xmath113 to @xmath147 , part of the interaction energy is released into the system with the consequent enhancement of the kinetic energy , which also results in substantial changes in the optical spectrum .     for the hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1 ] ) obtained by nlr and vnrl in a @xmath9-quench case , where @xmath9 is switched from @xmath148 to @xmath149 at @xmath139 .",
    "the probing time is set at @xmath139 in ( a ) and @xmath150 in ( b ) , respectively .",
    "model parameters : @xmath94 and @xmath151.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    additionally , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , a similar development of @xmath35 between the left and right columns can still be recognized regardless of the notable difference in quenches .",
    "this is consistent with the previous statement in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] that the vnlr is a kind of partial summation on the full temporal correlations in nlr . in the pump case ,",
    "the results of vnlr and nlr are closer to each other  @xcite compared with the cases of quenches , which might be due to the fact that the hamiltonian only changes temporarily with the application of the pump pulse , after which it goes back to its earlier form ; in both @xmath138-quench and @xmath9-quench , the hamiltonian undergoes a substantial change after the quench time .",
    "numerical checks in the periodic bc up to @xmath152 and the open bc in @xmath94 show similar results .",
    "thus we tend to conclude that the deviation between vnlr and nlr , which is due to different temporal correlation counting , persists with the increase of the system size .",
    "further , we note that the deviation of vnlr from nlr can be quite pronounced if the probing time is set to be close to the pump or quench moment before the relaxation fully commences .",
    "this is because , in contrast with nlr , vnlr only considers the temporal correlations starting from the probing time @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . figure  [ fig6 ] shows @xmath145 for the 1d half - filled hubbard model ( @xmath151 for the hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1 ] ) ) in a typical @xmath9-quench case , where the interaction @xmath9 is switched from @xmath148 to @xmath149 at @xmath139 . the probing time is set to be @xmath139 and @xmath150 in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "note that at @xmath153 , the ground state of the system is in a metallic state , and with any finite @xmath9 a charge gap is opened and the system becomes insulating . in fig .  [ fig6](a ) , we can observe that the resulting @xmath154 from vnlr shows a strong reminiscence of the initial metallic state with a prominent drude - like peak appearing near zero frequency , while the result from nlr , which takes into account more information about the subsequent nonequilibrium evolution , not only shows the depression of this peak , but it also produces additional structures in the higher - frequency regime .",
    "however , when the probing time is set at @xmath150 , by which time the relaxation between the kinetic energy and the interaction energy is largely finished , the results from vnlr and nlr bear more qualitative similarities .",
    "in this paper , we introduce a numerical method to calculate the time - dependent optical conductivity based on a simulation of the pump - probe experimental setup . according to the property of the probe pulse ,",
    "two different approaches are discussed , i.e. , pp - step and pp - gaussian , using either a step - like or a gaussian - like probing vector potential .",
    "we find that the two approaches can be identified with nonequilibrium linear - response theory and one of its variants , respectively .",
    "thus the connections between these various methods and their differences are clarified .",
    "numerical verification is given by employing the method systematically in the 1d half - filled extended hubbard model , both in and out of equilibrium .",
    "the latter includes three well - attended cases : the pump , @xmath138-quench , and @xmath9-quench . in the numerical results ,",
    "the probe - pulse dependence in nonequilibrium is especially significant in the quenches .",
    "we suggest that the nature of the probe pulses should be taken into account in the analysis of ultrafast thz spectroscopy measurements .",
