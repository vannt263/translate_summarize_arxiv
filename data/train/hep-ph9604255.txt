    "the strong interaction vacuum is believed to undergo certain kind of phase transition in high temperature and density environments .",
    "such a belief at high temperature is substantiated by both lattice qcd computations @xcite and the statistical bootstrap argument @xcite of the early days when the fundamental particles of strong interaction are considered to be baryons , mesons and corresponding resonances .",
    "the destination phases of the transition from the present day large scale strong interaction vacuum phase , in which the temperature and density can be regarded as zero , and the nature of these transitions remain , however , poorly understood .",
    "the best known new phase of qcd is the one called quark  gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which was found on lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "other phases , such as the chiral symmetry restoration phase @xcite , was also shown to happen together with the qgp in lattice qcd calculations .    to understand these questions",
    "is a worthwhile endeavor since , on the one hand , the behaviors of qcd are not known well enough to have all its possible phases listed with their properties predicted and , on the other hand , the experimental probes of the hadronic matter in the laboratories and the analysis of resulting data have not provided us with sufficiently clear pictures for the nature of the vacuum phases produced .",
    "for example , it is still not known for certain whether or not the qgp has been created in heavy ion collisions",
    ". however , an understanding of the above mentioned problems is of fundamental importance since the knowledge gained in this area can help us to understand the evolution of the early universe , the properties of the stellar matters in heavy stars , and eventually to tell , e.g. , where matter come from , why there appears to be an arrow for the time , etc .. it thus constitutes one of the frontiers of our knowledge that awaits to be explored .",
    "qcd is a highly nonlinear theory that is difficult to solve , especially at low and intermediate energies .",
    "lattice simulations are still limited by the power of computers , which allows the computation only on small lattice ( size ) systems .",
    "in addition , fermions are not easy to handle on lattices .",
    "the approach adopted by this study for the theoretical explorations is to use simplified fermionic models for the strong interaction which inherit most of the basic symmetries of qcd at long distances .",
    "these models can be considered to have large overlap with the ones that are derivable by integrating the gluon degrees of freedom ( in the path integration sense ) out from the original qcd lagrangian density . despite such an expectation may in fact",
    "not easily fulfilled in reality , we still consider this undertaken valuable since it can provide sharp predictions that can be compared to our empirical knowledge due to the relative simplicity of the model approaches .",
    "in addition , the simplicity of the model approach can let us investigate large set of possibilities ( for the fermionic sector ) that is otherwise not possible .",
    "in contrast to the theoretical exploration efforts , the model dependency of the study related to realistic physical systems , in which the theoretical possibilities is searched for , is reduced as much as possible by using model independent methods like , e.g. , symmetry constraints , sum rules , etc .. in doing so , the conclusion derived can be more reliable .    on the observational sides , the information about a nucleon in various reactions , the multiplicity production in @xmath0 annihilation and many others can be used to determine whether the theoretical possibilities discovered in model studies actually exist inside static systems like a nucleon and in a time dependent system like in the @xmath1 annihilation system . albeit a negative result of the above mentioned investigations does not necessary mean that these possibilities are forbidden in other processes like heavy ion collisions , which are the main topic of this workshop , the early universe , etc . , a positive result from these `` domestic '' experiments does increase the probabilities and are thus worth of studying .",
    "in addition , the structure of a nucleon , the hadronization mechanism in the @xmath0 annihilation are interesting problems on their own rights .",
    "the report consists of two parts . in the first part , which is based on refs .",
    "@xcite and work undertaken ref .",
    "@xcite , two massless fermionic models for the strong interaction are introduced with their vacuum phase structure determined .",
    "the massless fermions are identified as up ( u ) and down ( d ) quarks .",
    "four kinds of phases are found :",
    "1 ) the bare vacuum 2 ) the so called @xmath2-phase , in which the original chiral @xmath3 symmetry is spontaneously broken down to a flavor @xmath4 symmetry , that is widely studied in literature 3 ) the @xmath5-phase , in which the original chiral @xmath3 symmetry is also spontaneously broken down to a flavor @xmath4 symmetry ; it spontaneously breaks the @xmath6 symmetry corresponding to baryon number conservation induced by a condensation of diquarks 4 ) the @xmath7-phase , in which the original chiral @xmath3 symmetry is unbroken .",
    "the @xmath6 symmetry corresponding to baryon number conservation is also spontaneously broken , like in the @xmath5-phase .",
    "the second part consists of a study of three different issues .",
    "the first one is related to an examination of the pcac relationship for a nucleon , which is based upon ref .",
    "certain inconsistency that is in favor of the existence of a localized @xmath5-phase inside a nucleon is revealed .",
    "the second one provides a gauge invariant modification of the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule required by current experimental data .",
    "it is based upon ref .",
    "if the deviation of the experimental data from the gdh sum rule is proven genuine , a spontaneous broken down of the @xmath6 symmetry correspond to baryon number conservation inside a nucleon is shown to be a necessity .",
    "one of the most natural realization of such a symmetry breaking is by having @xmath5- or @xmath7- phase inside a nucleon .",
    "the third one is based upon the observed baryon ",
    "antibaryon rapidity difference correlation in a high energy @xmath1 annihilation which is discussed by prof .",
    "xie s group @xcite in shandong university in this workshop .",
    "experimental evidence exists @xcite that baryon number and antibaryon number is not locally produced in the observed jets .",
    "such a violation of locality can be shown to be a direct consequence of the fact that the string that fragments in to hadrons contains either the @xmath5- or @xmath7- phase . in the last chapter of this report ,",
    "a summary is provided and some speculations concerning the possibility of producing the @xmath5- or / and @xmath7- phases is given .",
    "the basic participants of the strong interaction we know of today are color carrying quarks ( antiquarks ) and gluons with basic interaction between them mediated by gluons according to the qcd lagrangian density , which is a non - abelian gauge theory with asymptotic freedom at short distances or high energies . at low and intermediate energies ,",
    "the interaction between color sources ( including quarks and gluons ) becomes strong enough to render a perturbative analysis useless . for a light quark system ,",
    "strong interaction can cause quark ",
    "antiquark pair production from the bare vacuum . with the increase of the interaction strength",
    ", it is expected that a macroscopic number of quark  antiquark pairs can be produced resulting in effects that survive the thermal limit to lead to various phase transitions in the vacuum .    at a formal level , the gluon degrees of freedom can be integrated out to obtain a pure quark ",
    "quark interaction effective action .",
    "such an effective quark ",
    "quark interaction action are expected to be very complicated if can be practically computed at all and difficult to analyze to extracting useful information without certain physical picture being built up using other indirect approaches .",
    "one of these approaches is to build models for the quark ",
    "quark interaction part that inherits the basic symmetries of the original lagrangian density .",
    "it is expected that the major physics emerged from these models has large overlap with the one implied by the qcd lagrangian .    before list",
    "the symmetries considered , let s make the first simplification .",
    "the behaviors of certain massless fermion system are expected to represent the light quark system , which is restricted to the up ( u ) and down ( d ) quark sector in the flavor space here , well .",
    "thus , for the simplicity of the discussion , we shall assume that the mass of the u and d quarks is zero .",
    "qcd lagrangian density with massless u and d quarks has , besides the ones listed in the following , a @xmath3 chiral symmetry .",
    "so the symmetries that these models should have in addition are 1 ) invariance under the lorentz group 2 ) global @xmath6 symmetry corresponding to the conservation of baryon number 3 ) local @xmath8 symmetry corresponding to the electromagnetism 4 ) global color @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "one of the well studied model with the above properties is the nambu jona ",
    "lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite used at the light quark level ( some include the strange quark as well ) .",
    "the fermion ",
    "fermion interaction terms are assumed to be of contact 4fermion form in the first part of the report .",
    "one of the best methods of treating these nonlinear 4fermion interaction models is to introduce auxiliary fields @xcite .",
    "the subtleties of introducing auxiliary fields related to the fierzing @xmath10 and crossing @xmath11 operations are discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "it shall not be discussed here .",
    "suffice it will be to use the following heuristic steps to show how auxiliary fields are introduced to handle these non - linear terms .    for simplicity ,",
    "let s consider the following fermion  fermion interaction model @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass of the fermion , @xmath14 is a 4component dirac spinor fermion field and @xmath15 is the coupling constant .    in the path integration formalism , the generating functional @xmath16 $ ] for the connected green functions for the fermions is @xmath17 \\right ) & = & n          \\int d[\\psi ] d[\\bar\\psi ] \\exp \\left [ i                 \\int d^4x \\left ( { \\cal",

    "the invariant amplitude @xmath126 enjoys a sum rule given by eq .",
    "its derivation involves three issues discussed in the following 1 ) is the use of the infinite momentum frame legitimate ?",
    "2 ) can the high energy ( @xmath128 ) behavior of @xmath129 be estimated using the regge asymptotics ?",
    "3 ) what s the role of gauge invariance in determining the large @xmath128 behavior of @xmath129 ?",
    "the need of using an infinite momentum frame in deriving a fixed @xmath116 sum rule like the gdh sum is discussed and emphasised in ref .",
    "it s validity in the derivation is generally assumed .",
    "it is also assumed in this work .",
    "the large energy physical hadronic scattering amplitudes follow certain power law ( in energy ) according to regge asymptotics @xcite , namely @xmath130 where @xmath128 is the energy variable and @xmath2 is the leading regge trajectory of the corresponding channel .",
    "the highest trajectory is that of the permeron with an @xmath131 @xcite . since the permeron has a spin one ( in the forward direction )",
    ", it can not be exchanged in some channels of reaction due to helicity conservation ; this allows the corresponding amplitude to change slower than @xmath128 .",
    "if the change is slow enough , it allows certain superconvergence relation to be derived for it in the corresponding channel for physical hadronic scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "the problems of using regge asymptotic behavior in deriving sum rules for matrix elements of a current ( between physical hadronic states ) is known from current algebra studies @xcite , in which it was found that a hypothetical case of isovector photon  nucleon scattering there appears the need of a `` j=1 fixed pole '' in the amplitude for the matrix elements of the time ordered current  current correlator .",
    "this problem can be understood if one realizes that the matrix elements of the time ordered current  current correlator does not correspond to a 4points physical hadronic scattering amplitude directly .",
    "the phenomenological regge asymptotics may fail for these amplitudes .",
    "this situation opens the door for a modification of those sum rule that are derived under the assumption of regge behavior for the matrix elements of the time ordered current  current correlator .",
    "for the gdh sum rule , this is suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite .    for the realistic photon ",
    "nucleon scattering , this kind of `` j=1 fixed pole '' effects can not be straight forwardly introduced in such a way that the results are consistent with current algebra .",
    "this is because it causes a modification of the commutation relation between the time component of the em current operator at equal - time , which tells us that they commute with each other .",
    "this requirement , together with gauge invariance , are expressed simply by eq .",
    "[ t - ward ] .",
    "a modification of the commutation relation between the charge density operators at equal - time is suggested in refs .",
    "it leads to a modification of the ward identity eq .",
    "[ t - ward ] , so that a mutual consistency of the arguments can be maintained .",
    "whether or not such a way of modifying gdh sum rule actually is consistent with phenomenology remains to be shown however .",
    "the scheme proposed in this study is different in that the gdh sum rule is modified by introducing an effective `` j=1 fixed pole '' effect without modifying the commutation relation between the charge density operators at equal - time .",
    "this is achieved by assuming there is a localized breaking down of the @xmath8 gauge symmetry inside a nucleon @xcite .",
    "the `` j=1 fixed pole '' effects are provided by the would - be goldstone boson of the symmetry breaking , which does not belong to physical excitation spectrum for a local gauge symmetry @xcite .    from the ward identity",
    "[ t - ward ] , there are three constraints for @xmath114 in eq .",
    "[ amplitude1 ] , namely , @xmath132 eq . [ g - inv3 ] is relevant to the possibility of modifying the gdh sum rule .",
    "the large @xmath128 behavior of @xmath133 can be determined to be @xcite @xmath134 . if the following assumption is made , namely , @xmath135 then the large @xmath128 behavior of @xmath136 at @xmath137 is @xmath138 following eq .",

    "[ assump1 ] , the large @xmath128 behavior of @xmath126 , which is relevant to the gdh sum rule , is controlled by that of @xmath139 . the large @xmath128 behavior of @xmath139 is bounded by the regge asymptotics because it is an gauge invariant invariant amplitude by itself , which means that it connects to physical scattering amplitude only ( for a detailed discussion on this point , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . thus @xmath140 with @xmath141 from helicity amplitude analysis @xcite .",
    "thus gauge invariance requirement expressed by eq .",
    "[ t - ward ] together with eq .",
    "[ assump1 ] eliminates the possibility of a modification of the gdh sum rule .",
    "the above analysis show that if gdh sum rule is to be modified in a way that respect the local em gauge invariance and the regge asymptotic behavior for physical hadronic scattering amplitudes , assumption eq .",
    "[ assump1 ] has to be relinquished by letting @xmath142 to has a pole like behavior in @xmath116 at large @xmath128 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath8 symmetry corresponding to em is spontaneously broken down inside a nucleon @xcite .",
    "more specifically , introducing an order parameter @xmath143 , defined as @xmath144 for the em gauge symmetry inside a nucleon is necessary since localized spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking is discussed here . a finite region in space only looks more and more like an infinite system when smaller and smaller distances or higher and higher energies are probed . ] .",
    "if the @xmath8 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down , then there is a massless pole in @xmath142 in the @xmath145 limit so that @xmath143 can be nonzero . with @xmath143 ,",
    "the gdh sum rule is modified to @xmath146    numerically , the value for @xmath147 and @xmath148 and their difference can be extracted from the results of the integration of the total photon ",
    "nucleon cross sections given in ref .",
    "they take the value @xmath149 and @xmath150 . as a final remark for this section",
    ", it should be mentioned that @xmath151 has a dimension of length squared .",
    "it can be written as @xmath152 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath153 , which correspond to the natural scale of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in strong interaction .",
    "it shows that if the current discrepancy between cross section @xmath105 and @xmath106 obtained from the the photo pion production on a nucleon data and the gdh sum rule is genuine , then a localized spontaneous breaking down of the @xmath8 symmetry inside a nucleon has to be introduced .",
    "as it is discussed in part i of this report , such a symmetry breaking is in principle possible since the @xmath8 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down in the @xmath5- and @xmath7- phases @xcite .",
    "the hadronization processes in the @xmath1 annihilation can be described reasonably well by a chain like picture in terms of string ( or flux tube ) fragmentation . for the meson production ,",
    "quark and antiquark pair is created by a breaking of the string that connects the parent quark  antiquark pairs . at the breaking point ,",
    "any nonvanishing conserved quantum number like charge , baryon number , etc .",
    "are created in conjugate pairs so that they cancel locally ( in space - time ) there .",
    "the reason behind it is that the string is considered to be neutral in these quantum numbers .",
    "monte carlo simulation programs like the jetset @xcite and herwig @xcite , which are based upon such a picture describe the experimental data well .",
    "this picture of hadronization implies strong rapidity correlation between pairs of hadrons that conjugate to each other in the multihadron final state . since , before the string fragmentation , it is in a stage of uniform expansion , the neighboring hadrons produced on the string by a fragmentation has rapidity close to each other than others .",
    "it is difficult to test the consequences of this picture using the mesonic component of the final state since 1 ) the correlating meson pairs are hard to identify and 2 ) the interaction between the mesonic particles are stronger than that of the baryons in the @xmath1 annihilation .",
    "the interaction distorts the rapidity information of the meson at the time when it is created . on the other hand , larger than 50@xmath155 of the baryons",
    "escape the hadronic clouds before interaction effects grow ; they therefore carry the rapidity information at their production time @xcite .",
    "one of the best characters of the string fragmentation picture for hadronization in the @xmath1 annihilation processes is the strong rapidity difference correlation between a pair of baryon and antibaryon ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "the experimental examination of it was carried out by observing the @xmath157 rapidity difference correlation @xcite in @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath158 gev by opal collaboration .",
    "a `` surprise '' was found that the width of the rapidity difference correlation between @xmath157 pairs are wider than it is expected from the one predicted by the above mentioned fragmentation model , which consists of the creation of diquark  antidiquark pairs on the string for the formation of baryons , similar to the quark ",
    "antiquark pair creation for mesons production . in order to describe the data ,",
    "the so - called popcorn mechanism @xcite has to be introduced , and , in addition , the percentage of the popcorn configuration has to be large in the fragmentation processes @xcite .",
    "the popcorn mechnism implies a non - local production of conjugate baryon number pairs on the string under the fragmentation since , in between them , there has to be a finite space that contains the meson .",
    "the conclusion that conjugate baryon numbers carried by diquark and antidiquark on the string are not created at the same spacetime point is hard to understand if the string that fragments into @xmath154 pairs are neutral in baryon number . according to the principle of relativisty , it violates the classical causality which requires local cancellation of baryon number and antibaryon number at the time when they are created from a baryon neutral source ; the speed of their separation should be less than the speed of light .",
    "this difficulty can however be solved if one assumes that there exsits @xmath5- or @xmath7- phase inside the string under the fragmentation .",
    "the reason , as it is discussed in section [ sec : cp - vio ] of part i is that , spontaneous separation of baryon numbers are favored in these phases ( see , for example , fig . [",
    "fig : baryon ] ) .",
    "therefore if one of the above mentioned phases is present inside the string before a fragmentation , the baryon density on the string can be non - zero at a specific point ; it is positive or negative alternatively along the string .",
    "thus , by assuming the existence of the @xmath5- or @xmath7- phase discussed in part i of the report , we can gain a deeper understanding of the empirical popcorn mechanism needed in phenomenology .    before closing this short chapter , let s reminded the reader that this finding , if proved genuine in the future after more comprehensive studies , could provide a domestic experimental basis for the baryogensis mechanism in a matter ",
    "antimatter symmetric universe @xcite under the standard cosmology ( big - bang ) , which is based upon the spontaneous separation of baryonic matter and antibaryonic matter at certain time during the evolution of the univers @xcite , without violating the observational constraints @xcite .",
    "it is certainly a worthy topic to be further studied .",
    "the theoretically possible phases in an interacting massless two flavor quark system are discussed in the chapters of part i of this report by introducing model lagrangians .",
    "four phases are found .",
    "some of their properties are discussed while others are mentioned with references containing more details provided . in part",
    "ii , three different observations , which is currently considered difficult to understand using the conventional picture , are discussed in the light of the findings presented in part i of this report .",
    "we find it likely that localized diquark condensed phases exist inside a nucleon and hadronic excited states ( within the flux tube ) .    in the heavy ion collisions , baryon number density and the volume containing it can be much larger than that of a nucleon .",
    "it is thus very probable that the @xmath5- or @xmath7- phase can be produced despite the short time duration of the collision .",
    "what signals their existence existence and how to find them are questions that can be further investigated .",
