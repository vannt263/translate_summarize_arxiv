    "over the last 15 years , as part of the `` sun in time '' program , we have been carrying out an in - depth study of solar - type stars with different ages , rotation rates and correspondingly vastly different levels of magnetic activity .",
    "the main goals of this program are to investigate the solar dynamo , and to determine the dependence of coronal x - ray / euv emissions and chromospheric / transition region ( tr ) fuv / uv emissions on stellar age and rotation .",
    "the latter goal was expanded to include the contruction of xuv spectral irradiance tables for the sun over its main sequence lifetime ( e.g. guinan et al . 2003 ; ribas et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these spectral xuv irradiances are very important in studies of the effects of the young sun s increased radiation on paleoplanetary atmospheres and environments .",
    "we use a homogeneous sample of @xmath215 single , nearby dg05 stars as proxies for the sun ( and solar - type stars ) , covering ages from @xmath2100 myr to 8.5 gyr .",
    "the ages of the younger program stars are inferred from memberships in various clusters / moving groups , while the ages for the older stars are secured from isochronal fits .",
    "the rotation periods are obtained chiefly from ground - based photometry ( star spot modulation ) or from chromospheric ca ii rotationally induced variability .",
    "excellent relationships are found among rotation , age and activity ( see guinan et al .",
    "the program stars have been observed from x - ray  uv using _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , _ chandra _ , _ xmm _ , _ euve _ , _ fuse _ , _ iue _ and _",
    "the strength of our sample is its homogeneity .",
    "in essence , we use a @xmath21 m@xmath3 star as a laboratory to study the effects of the stellar dynamo ( with similar convective zone ( cz ) depths ) by varying the only free parameter , p@xmath4 .",
    "our studies have shown that the sun s magnetic field has steadily declined as its rotation slowed due to magnetic breaking .",
    "also , the study of the young sun s ( as well as other dg stars ) xuv fluxes using solar proxies reveals unprecedented diagnostics for the state of the younger solar system and the physics of the much more active early sun ( ayres et al .",

    "1 shows a plot of rotation period vs. stellar age for most of our `` sun in time '' sample , with a power law fit , showing the spin - down of the sun and other solar - type stars with age .",
    "2 shows the related decrease in x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath5 ) with age for the `` sun in time '' sample .",
    "as shown in these figures , the young sun was rotating over 10x faster than the present sun and had correspondingly high ( 51000x ) levels of xuv coronal and chromospheric emissions .",
    "most of the observed ranges in l@xmath5 for the older , less active stars shown in fig . 2 arise from solar - like activity cycles .",

    "the ranges in l@xmath5 for the sun and other older solar - type stars arise mainly from activity cycles.,width=384 ]    the `` sun in time '' program also bears on the crucial question of the influence of the young sun s strong xuv emissions on the developing planetary system  in particular on the photochemical and photoionization evolution of early planetary atmospheres .",
    "the constructed spectral irradiance tables are of interest to researchers in paleoplanetary atmospheres and for studies on the atmospheric evolution of the large number of extrasolar planets found orbiting other g - type stars .",
    "the irradiance data have been published by ribas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and examples in the fuv / uv region are given in fig .",
    "as shown , there are dramatic decreases in the fuv ( _ fuse _ ) and fuv / uv ( _ iue _ ) emission line strengths ( and irradiances ) as the star loses angular momentum and spins down with age .",
    "4 shows the averaged xuv irradiance changes over time for the sun and other solar - type ( dg05 ) stars from solar proxies of different ages .",
    "the plot illustrates how emissions associated with hotter plasmas diminish more rapidly as the stars rotate slower with age .",
    "the coronal x - ray / euv emissions of the young main sequence sun were approximately 1001000x stronger than the present sun .",
    "similarly , the tr and chromospheric fuv & uv emissions of the young sun are 10100x and 510x stronger , respectively , than at present . also shown in fig",

    ", the sun s luminosity increased from @xmath20.7 l@xmath3 to 1.0 l@xmath3 .",
    "this change in solar luminosity arises from the acceleration of nuclear fusion in its core that causes its radius and surface temperature to slowly increase with time .        ) over time , where l@xmath3 = 1 is the luminosity of the present 4.6 gyr sun ( l@xmath3).,width=432 ]    we have been collaborating with planetary scientists and astrobiology groups to study the effects of the young sun s ( and other dg05 stars ) strong xuv irradiance on the loss of water from mars and its implications for the oxidation of the martian soil ( lammer et al .",
    "it has been assumed , from topographic and geological studies , that mars was originally warmer and much wetter than at present , and likely possessed a @xmath21 bar atmosphere .",
    "lammer et al .",
    "considered ion pick - up sputtering , as well as dissociative recombination processes .",
    "the loss of h@xmath6o from mars over the last 3.5 gyr was estimated to be equivalent to a global martian h@xmath6o ocean with a depth of about @xmath712 m. if ion momentum transport , a process to be studied in detail by mars express , is significant on mars , the water loss may be enhanced by a factor of about 2 . for this study",
    "it has been assumed that , for the first billion years , mars had a hot liquid iron core and , through rotation , possessed a significant magnetic field and resulting magnetosphere .",
    "this magnetosphere essentially protected the early martian environment from the combination of high levels of xuv radiation and strong winds of the younger sun that would have otherwise removed its atmosphere . however , mars is a smaller , less massive planet than the earth , and lost heat at a faster rate . thus its iron core solidified @xmath21 billion years after the planet s formation .",
    "without the magnetic field , the outer martian atmosphere was exposed to the ionizing effects and strong winds of the early sun , and thus partially eroded .",
    "photolysis of water ensued , with a preferential loss of the lighter hydrogen over the heavier oxygen .",
    "the loss of water and water vapor from the atmosphere resulted in a greatly diminished greenhouse effect and a rapid cooling of the lower martian atmosphere .",
    "this rapid cooling ( dropping below the freezing point of water ) permitted some water to remain behind , possibly as permafrost trapped below the martian soil .",
    "this scenario is illustrated in fig .",
    "a recent study ( kulikov et al . 2006 ) has been published using solar - proxy data ( from ribas et al .",
    "2005 and wood et al .",
    "2002 ; 2005 ) to study the atmosphere and water loss from early venus .",
    "this study shows that water on early venus ( only 0.71 au from the sun ) was essentially all lost during the first @xmath20.5 gyr after its formation from the vigorous action of strong ( massive ) winds and high xuv fluxes from the young sun . in another study , by grie@xmath8meier",

    "irradiance date were used to investigate the atmospheric loss of extrasolar planets resulting from xuv heating , which can lead to the evaporation of `` hot jupiters . ''",
    "the discovery of extrasolar planets ( now 200 + planets ) orbiting mostly main - sequence dg , dk , and dm stars during the last decade has motivated the expansion of the `` sun in time '' program to include cooler , lower luminosity but very numerous dk and dm stars .",
    "also , with the upcoming extrasolar planet search and study space missions such as _ corot _ , _ kepler _ , _ sim _ and , in a decade , _ darwin / tpf _ , thousands of additional extrasolar planets are expected to be found . also , with _",
    "corot _ and _ kepler _ it will even be possible to discover earth - size planets orbiting within the circumstellar liquid water habitable zones ( hzs ) of the host stars .",
    "the goals of this investigation are similar to the original `` sun in time '' program  _ 1 ) _ modeling of dk  dm stars to understand magnetic activity and dynamo energy generation in low mass stars with very deep czs and _ 2 ) _ constructing xuv spectral irradiance tables covering dk  dm stars with a wide range of ages .",
    "the selected program stars ( @xmath215 nearby dm05 stars ) have well determined parallaxes , colors , spectral types and most have observations of age - sensitive measures such as _ uvw _ space motions , l@xmath5 , mg  ii @xmath9 and ca  ii @xmath10 emission fluxes .",
    "this study , besides improving ( and testing ) our understanding of magnetic - related phenomena in cool stars , will help to identify and characterize dk & dm stars that have planets suitable for life .",
    "because of their high space densities , dk stars , and especially dm stars , will be common targets of extrasolar planet search missions .",
    "also , their low masses and small radii make them attractive targets for planet hunting using radial velocity , astrometric , and transit eclipse methods .",
    "dm stars in particular make interesting targets for exobiology . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the liquid water circumstellar hzs for earth - like planets depend strongly on the luminosity of the host star ( see kasting & catling 2003 ) .",
    "the temperature of the planet depends on the luminosity of the host star , and the planet s distance ( 1/r@xmath11 ) from the star . also important",
    "are the planet s albedo and greenhouse gas heat trapping contributions . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , because of the low luminosities of dm stars , their hzs are located quite close to the central star ( @xmath00.4 au ) .",
    "this makes the hypothetical hz planet around a dm star more strongly influenced by stellar flares , winds , and plasma ejection events ( coronal mass ejections = cmes ) that are frequent in young dm stars ( e.g. kasting et al .",
    "1993 ; lammer et al .",
    "also , because of the long lifetimes of dm stars ( @xmath150 gyr ) , it might be possible for life on a planet in the hz to be much more evolved ( and advanced ? ) than ourselves . in the following section we focus on our new program to study the magnetic evolution and xuv fluxes of dm stars .",
    "this program is called `` living with a red dwarf . ''",
    "the major aims of the `` living with a red dwarf '' program are to understand the magnetic activity , dynamo structure and plasma physics , as well as determining the x - ray / fuv spectral irradiances of dm stars with widely different rotations , ages and , therefore , greatly different corresponding levels of magnetic activity .",
    "the program stars are limited to spectral types of dm05 and cover a wide range of p@xmath4 ( @xmath120.5  200d ) , ages ( @xmath120.1  @xmath213 gyr ) , and activity levels ( e.g. log l@xmath5 : @xmath225.5  29.5 ergs / s ) .",
    "this work complements ongoing related programs being carried out on main sequence dg  dk stars ( e.g. guinan et al . 2005 ; lakatos et al . 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , this program is a further important step in understanding the linkage between magnetic energy generation and propagation ( from stellar dynamo activity ) and emission losses in the stellar chromosphere , tr , and corona ( e.g. , ulmschneider et al . 1999 ; rammacher & cuntz 2003 ) of stars with very deep convective envelopes . as part of this program we are carrying out high precision photometry to determine rotation periods and starspot coverages . also , we are extensively utilizing nasa / esa x - ray  uv archival data , and have several active programs / proposals to obtain further _ fuse _ and _ xmm _ observations to fill in the parameter space of age / rotation / activity for our dm star sample .",
    "for example , the _ fuse _ fuv spectral region ( 9201180 ) contains important diagnostic emission lines that can be used to characterize the energy transfer and atmospheric structure while the ratio of c iii 977/1175  fluxes provides valuable information about the tr electron pressure ( see guinan et al .",
    "these programs have also become important for gauging the fuv emissions of these stars ( mostly contributed by the h i lyman series , c iii 977/1175 , and o vi 1032/1038  emissions ) that are critical to assess the photochemical and photoionization evolution of planetary atmospheres and ionospheres and the possible development of life on extrasolar planets ( kasting 1997 ; guinan & ribas 2002 ; kasting & catling 2003 ; guinan et al .",
    "2003 ; ribas et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the characterizations of the xuv irradiances of dm stars are important because dm stars comprise @xmath170% of stars in the solar neighborhood ( and probably in the galaxy ) and have extremely long ( @xmath150 gyr ) lifetimes .",
    "a fraction of these dm stars may host planets within their circumstellar hzs , located nearby ( @xmath00.4 au ) the host star . on one hand , the frequent flaring of dm stars ( e.g. see gdel et al . 2003 ) and possible tidal locking of close - in planets ( joshi et al .",
    "1997 ) could challenge the early development of life on a planet located in their shrunken , close - in circumstellar liquid water hzs . on the other hand , were life to form , the longevities of dm stars would be favorable to the development of advanced modes of intelligent life .",
    "although dm stars have not been specifically targeted in major extrasolar planet searches , so far planets have been discovered orbiting 3 nearby dm stars ( il aqr , gj 581 , and gj 424 ) .",
    "in fact , two of the three planets orbiting il aqr are located within the star s hz  one of them is a `` super - earth '' ( rivera et al .",
    "moreover , theoretical studies by boss ( 2006 ) predict the rapid formation of `` super earths '' around dm stars indicating that earth  like planets hosted by dm stars could be numerous .",
    "more recently , several additional dm stars in the direction of the galactic bulge have been found , from _ hst / acs _ photometry , to show transit eclipses arising from jupiter - size planets ( sahu et al .",
    "interestingly , these extrasolar planets orbit with ultra - short periods ( p@xmath13 @xmath12 1 day ) .    because of their deep outer czs , dm stars have very efficient magnetic dynamos and , consequently , f@xmath14/f@xmath15 values of 10@xmath1110@xmath16 higher than solar - type dg stars of comparable ages .",
    "thus , possible earth - like planets orbiting within the shrunken hzs near to the dm star host will receive enhanced xuv radiation relative to their incident bolometric irradiances .",
    "this could have interesting and significant photochemical and photoionization effects on the outer atmospheres of hosted hz planets . on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "7 , dm stars are cool and have no significant photospheric uv  nuv fluxes at wavelengths shorter than @xmath22500 .",
    "thus , their nuv fluxes are far below those of dg and early dk stars .",
    "an excellent summary appraising the habitability of planets hosted by dm stars is given by tarter et al .",
    "unlike more massive and luminous dg and early dk stars , the nuclear reaction rates in the cores of dm stars are very slow , resulting in their low luminosities ( l @xmath0 0.06 l@xmath3 ) and extremely long main sequence lifetimes ( @xmath17 @xmath1 50 gyr ) . as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the luminosities of dm stars are essentially constant over tens of billions of years after their arrival on the main sequence .",
    "for this reason , their hzs remain fixed over eons of time , ensuring a stable energy source for a possible hosted planet . by contrast , stars like the sun undergo significant changes in luminosity on timescales of billions of years , causing their hzs to move slowly outward over time .",
    "for example , in @xmath21 billion years , our earth will no longer lie within the then more luminous sun s hz , resulting in the commencement of the runaway greenhouse effect on earth , in which the oceans begin to evaporate .",
    "given their low surface temperatures , dm stars radiate predominantly in the near ir , and they have essentially no photospheric continuum flux @xmath12 @xmath22500  ( see fig .",
    "however , because of their deep czs and resulting efficient magnetic dynamos , dm stars have strong magnetic dynamo generated coronal / tr / chromospheric fuv / uv emissions with xuv surface fluxes exceeding those of dg stars with comparable ages .",
    "similar to the results of the `` sun in time '' program , young dm stars rotate rapidly and have correspondingly strong dynamo - generated xuv emissions .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "9 shows the decrease in fuv o vi emission strengths between ad leo ( 100 myr ) and proxima cen ( 5.8 gyr ) .",
    "young dm stars are also well known for strong and frequent high energy flares , which emit strong xuv radiation . moreover , unlike dg stars",
    ", dm stars magnetic related activity appears to persist for longer times ( a few billion years ) .",
    "even older dm stars are known to flare , examples being proxima cen ( @xmath25.8 gyr ) and barnard s star ( @xmath29 gyr ) .",
    "a summary of some of the more important characteristics of dm stars are given below , as well as some implications for planets orbiting close to them .",
    "* dm stars have long lifetimes ( @xmath150 gyr ) and nearly constant luminosities ( see fig .",
    "* dm stars are ubiquitous , comprising @xmath170% of stars in the solar neighborhood and have low masses ( @xmath120.5 m@xmath3 ) , temperatures ( @xmath123900 k ) and luminosities ( @xmath00.06 l@xmath3 ) .",
    "* unlike solar - type stars , dm stars have essentially no photospheric continua in the uv ( @xmath122500 ) , because of their low temperatures ( see fig . 7 ) .",
    "* dm stars have deep outer czs , very efficient magnetic dynamos and , consequently , resulting strong coronal x - ray , transition region fuv & chromospheric fuv ",
    "uv emissions .",
    "for example , the ratio of l@xmath5 to total bolometric luminosity for dm stars is , on average , 10@xmath18 times that of solar - type stars .",
    "( e.g. @xmath19l@xmath5/l@xmath15@xmath20_{\\rm dm}$ ] @xmath21 10@xmath22 and @xmath19l@xmath5/l@xmath15@xmath20_\\odot$ ] @xmath21 10@xmath23 ) * the only source of xuv radiation of dm stars is from dynamo - generated coronal / chromospheric emissions and related flares .",
    "* dm stars have frequent flares even up to relatively old ages .",
    "for example , proxima cen ( @xmath17 @xmath21 5.8 gyr ) has about one large flare per day . *",
    "theoretical studies by boss ( 2006 ) indicate that `` super earths '' can easily form in the proto - planetary disks of dm stars .",
    "planets hosted by dm stars should be at least as common as those hosted by solar - type stars . even without much effort ,",
    "several dm stars have been found to host planets ( see text ) .",
    "* dm stars ( dm05 ) have hzs located very close to the host star at @xmath20.1au @xmath12 hz @xmath0 0.4au .",
    "( see fig .",
    "6 ) * although the bolometric irradiance levels within the shrunken hzs of dm stars would be comparable to those received on earth from the present sun , the dynamo - generated coronal - chromospheric xuv line emissions at wavelengths @xmath121800  could be 310x stronger .",
    "this occurs because dm stars have much higher values of l@xmath5/l@xmath15 and l@xmath24/l@xmath15 than the sun and solar - type stars of comparable ages .",
    "thus , because of the proximity of the planet to the dm star , the x  fuv irradiances are higher . *",
    "dm stars flare frequently and thus emit impulsive xuv energies that could be a problem for life on a planet orbiting in the hz .",
    "however , as shown by cockell et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and more recently by cuntz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , even a thin atmosphere , such as that of mars , does not allow any incoming fuv / x - ray radiation with wavelengths @xmath122000  to reach the surface .",
    "on the other hand , these impulsive bursts of radiation ( with @xmath12000 ) could help , not hinder the development of life from mutations in the dna of possible life forms . *",
    "although wind and coronal mass ejection events ( cme ) have yet to be directly measured for dm stars , scaling from the sun and inferred wind properties of younger cool stars from astrosphere ly-@xmath25 studies ( see wood et al . 2002 ; 2005 ) , it is assumed that young dm stars will have dense winds enhanced by frequent cme events that could have major effects on the heating of the exosphere of the planet and on the subsequent possible erosion and loss of its atmosphere if the planet does not possess a protective magnetosphere ( see grie@xmath8meier et al .",
    "* the nearly constant luminosities of dm stars over time scales of tens of billions of years results in fixed hzs .",
    "this provides a stable environment for life to form and evolve on a possible dm star hz planet . * in our galaxy , there are many old dm stars ( @xmath17 @xmath1 5 gyr ) .",
    "this could mean that life ( assuming that it formed in the first place ) on a hz planet around a dm star could be much more evolved and more advanced than us at 4.6 gyr .",
