    "raman scattering is the inelastic scattering of light .",
    "the frequency of a photon can change by transferring energy to and/or receiving energy from the lattice vibrations of the material . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the `` allowed '' energies of an oscillation are quantized and - in the case of a harmonic oscillation - equidistant .",
    "the vibrations of the lattice can thus be described in the language of quasi - particles and the term _ phonon _ is usually used .",
    "the incoming photon changes its energy by effectively exciting or absorbing one or several phonons . if a phonon is excited , the photon looses energy and the process is called _ stokes _ scattering . in the case of the absorption of a phonon ,",
    "the photon gains energy and the process is referred to as _ anti - stokes _ scattering .",
    "the spectrum of the inelastically scattered light therefore features discrete peaks , whose positions can be directly associated with certain vibrational modes of the crystal .    in first order raman scattering ,",
    "only optical phonons at the brillouin zone center can be excited .",
    "furthermore , selection rules only allow for vibrations with special symmetry properties .",
    "for graphene , only one peak , the so - called @xmath0  peak , is due to first - order raman scattering .",
    "an additional line , the so - called @xmath1  line , is due to second order raman scattering , where two phonons are excited at the same time .",
    "the overall raman spectrum of graphene thus consists mainly of two peaks ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : example - spectrum ] ) and is quite similar to the spectrum of graphite and of carbon nanotubes . nevertheless , via the exact peak positions , their width , their dispersion as a function of the exciting laser energy , and the occurrence of side peaks ,",
    "raman spectroscopy yields a surprising amount of information about graphene samples : for example , it gives information on the number of layers , their stacking order , the underlying substrate , defects , impurities , doping , and strain .",
    "since raman scattering is a fast and non - invasive method , it has evolved into one of the principal characterization tools for graphene and related graphitic materials .",
    "raman spectroscopy is often categorized as `` vibrational spectroscopy '' because it probes primarily the phonon frequencies .",
    "however , a quantitative description of the raman intensities is deeply connected to the optical ( absorption and emission ) properties of the concerned material .",
    "this is particularly the case for resonant raman spectroscopy , where the emitted / absorbed light is in resonance with electronic transitions . in graphene , due to the linear crossing of the optically active @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands ,",
    "the raman effect is resonant for all laser frequencies in the infrared , visible , and near uv ranges .",
    "different `` quantum pathways ''  @xcite ( corresponding to contributions of different microscopic processes in perturbation theory ) contribute to the intensity of a given peak .",
    "this gives rise to intriguing quantum interference effects with sometimes surprising consequences for the raman intensities ( e.g. , as a function of laser energy and of sample doping ) .",
    "furthermore , the intensities and the widths of the raman peak are strongly influenced by the lifetimes of intermediate electronic excitations .",
    "raman scattering thus also bears information on the complex dynamics of electron - hole pairs in graphene .",
    "all this makes a chapter on raman spectroscopy an integral part of a book about the optical properties of graphene .    a number of books / book chapters  @xcite and review articles  @xcite have already been devoted to the topic of raman scattering in graphitic materials .",
    "this book chapter puts particular emphasis on the theoretical foundations of resonant raman scattering in graphene .",
    "it explains the basic theory for raman scattering in graphene using perturbation theory .",
    "together with the study of the groundbreaking theoretical research articles ( in particular  @xcite ) , it should enable the newcomer to the field to learn how an exact quantitative calculation can be achieved in principle .",
    "for the computationally less ambitious reader , the chapter gives detailed qualitative understanding how the different terms in perturbation theory depend on external stimuli ( such as doping , defects , or strain ) and what conclusions one can draw from the raman spectra .    the chapter is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : theory ] , we first introduce the basic building blocks for the understanding of resonant raman spectra in graphene : the electronic band structure , the phonon dispersion , the coupling between electrons and phonons , and the coupling of the electronic states to light .",
    "afterwards , the formalism of time - dependent perturbation theory is applied to give the reader an intuitive understanding and enable her / him to study the relevant research literature . in section  [ sec : applications ] , the theory is then applied to understand qualitatively and quantitatively , how raman spectroscopy can be used to study the quality of graphene flakes as well as to understand the effects of environment , doping and strain .",
    "in this first section , we will have a look at the microscopic origin of the raman spectrum of graphene , in particular the behavior , shape , and size of its various peaks .",
    "to this end , we will use time - dependent perturbation theory to calculate expressions for the raman scattering amplitudes .",
    "this approach has the advantage that the individual terms of the perturbation series can be represented by so - called _",
    "feynman diagrams_. the graphical representation of the calculation allows for both easier bookkeeping of the terms in the perturbation series and at the same time gives a simple physical picture for the microscopic processes governing raman scattering .    in the first part of this section",
    ", we will introduce the basic building blocks needed for the perturbation theory calculation .",
    "we briefly discuss the electronic band structure of graphene before having a more detailed look at the phonon dispersion of graphene .",
    "thereafter , we will discuss the coupling between electrons and phonons and their treatment in perturbation theory and show how to include the effects of an external electromagnetic field , i.e. of incoming and outgoing photons .",
    "this first part will be concluded by briefly touching upon electron - defect scattering and a summary in which we give a graphical representation of the mathematical expressions for the various building blocks in terms of feynman diagrams .",
    "the second part contains an overview over the kinematics of raman scattering .",
    "we will derive what kind of peaks are expected in the raman spectrum of graphene based on kinematical considerations alone .    in the third subsection",
    ", we will focus on the actual calculation of the raman spectrum . using time - dependent perturbation theory and the language of feynman diagrams",
    ", we will demonstrate how the raman spectrum of graphene can be calculated .",
    "in this section we will mainly focus on the two most prominent raman peaks and study their behavior from the scattering amplitude obtained in perturbation theory .",
    "we start by introducing the basic ingredients needed to theoretically describe the raman spectrum of graphene .",
    "these ingredients are the electronic band structure , the phonon dispersion , the electron - phonon coupling , the electron - light coupling , and ( if the sample is not perfect ) electron - defect scattering . with the exception of the latter , we will have a look at each of these building blocks before we conclude this section with a summary .",
    "graphene is a monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a two - dimensional hexagonal lattice .",
    "each carbon atom possesses four valence electrons , three of which occupy hybridized @xmath4 orbitals , which form strong , in - plane covalent @xmath5bonds .",
    "the forth valence electron occupies a @xmath6-orbital , which form @xmath2-bonds , in which the electrons are delocalized . the electronic band structure , obtained from an _ ab initio _ calculation using density functional theory ( dft ) is shown in fig .  [ fig : lat - elec - bands ]",
    ".     obtained from density functional theory ( dft ) in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the full lines are the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands that are by far the most important bands for the raman scattering process . ]    since we will be interested in describing and calculating the raman spectrum for excitation energies in or near the visible spectral range ( @xmath71.5 - 4  ev ) , it is sufficient to focus on the bands near the fermi energy , which are the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands ( full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : lat - elec - bands ] ) .",
    "note that for a quantitatively accurate calculation of the raman spectrum , the dft band structure needs to be corrected to properly include electron - electron - interaction effects .",
    "these corrections can be computed , for example , within the @xmath8  approximation  @xcite and their main effect is a steepening of the conic @xmath2  bands around the @xmath9  point with their slope increasing by roughly 18%  @xcite .",
    "besides the electronic band structure , the phonon dispersion of graphene also plays a very important role for the understanding of the raman spectrum . since the lattice structure of graphene",
    "can be described by a hexagonal lattice with two atoms per unit cell , the phonon band structure consists of 2@xmath103=6 branches : three acoustic ones , which can be further divided into an in - plane longitudinal ( la ) , an in - plane transverse ( ta ) and an out - of - plane transverse ( za ) branch , and three optical branches , which can also be separated into in - plane longitudinal ( lo ) , in - plane transverse ( to ) , and out - of - plane transverse ( zo ) .",
    "the terms `` longitudinal '' and `` transverse '' refer to displacements in directions parallel and perpendicular to the quasimomentum @xmath11 of the phonon , respectively .",
    "note that these notions only make sense for small phonon wave vectors , i.e for @xmath11 near @xmath12 .",
    "away from @xmath12 , the character of the modes is a mixture of acoustic ( in - phase oscillations of neighboring atoms ) and optical ( opposite phase oscillations of neighboring atoms ) behavior .",
    "however , for simplicity the labels la etc .",
    "are usually also used to designate the phonon branches away from @xmath12 by following the specific branch along the high - symmetry lines .",
    "the phonon dispersion of graphene as obtained from a density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phon - dispersion]a .    the most prominent features of the phonon dispersion are the kink in the to  branch at @xmath9 and the positive slope of the lo  branch at @xmath12 .",
    "as we will see in a later section , these are precisely the parts of the phonon dispersion that play the most important role in the description of the raman spectrum as the phonons that contribute the most to it are the two degenerate in - plane optical phonons at @xmath12 and the phonons of the to branch around the @xmath9  point , whose lattice vibration patterns are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : displacements ] . for a description of the raman spectrum",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to accurately describe these parts of the phonon dispersion .",
    "the pronounced kinks arise due to so - called _ kohn anomalies _  @xcite .",
    "when the lattice ions vibrate according to a phonon mode with wave vector @xmath11 , they induce an electronic charge density of the same periodicity , whose magnitude becomes large when @xmath11 connects two points on the fermi surface .",
    "since the fermi surface of graphene consists of the two points @xmath9 and @xmath13 at the corners of the brillouin zone ( which are separated by a vector @xmath14 ) , phonons with @xmath15 or @xmath16 lead to these large , periodic electronic charge densities .",
    "these electronic charge densities in turn lead to descreased screening of the ionic charges , leading to a great enhancement of electron - phonon interaction .",
    "this large electron - phonon coupling for @xmath11 near @xmath12 or @xmath9 is responsible for the comparatively steep slope of the phonon dispersion ( i.e. the kinks ) in these parts of the brillouin zone , since it can be shown that at @xmath12 and @xmath9 , the slope of the phonon dispersion is directly proportional to the squared electron - phonon coupling between the corresponding phonon and electrons in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands averaged over a small circle of electronic @xmath17 vectors around the fermi points @xmath9 and @xmath13  @xcite .    the increased electron - phonon coupling at @xmath12 and especially at @xmath9 is further strongly enhanced by electronic correlation effects  @xcite .",
    "this manifests itself in the inaccurate quantitative description of the phonon dispersion near @xmath9 in density functional theory , where correlation effects due to electron - electron interaction are not well - described by exchange - correlation functionals in the commonly used local density or generalized gradient approximations .",
    "as will be commented upon in the next subsection , it is possible to obtain a more accurate description of the electron - phonon coupling for phonons at @xmath12 and @xmath9 on the level of the @xmath8  approximation .",
    "these corrected values for the electron - phonon coupling lead to a correction of the phonon frequencies within perturbation theory .",
    "the most important result is a steepening of the kink near @xmath9 and a decrease of the phonon frequency of the to  branch at @xmath9 by more than 100  @xmath18  @xcite , which matches the experimental data well ( compare fig .  [ fig : phon - dispersion]b ) .",
    "besides a description of the electron and phonon band structures , one needs a description of the coupling between the two .",
    "for this , we consider the electronic hamiltonian ( discarding electron - electron interaction for the moment ) , which has the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the position and momentum operator , respectively , and @xmath22 is the lattice potential which depends parametrically on the position of the nuclei , which we collectively denote with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 labels the unit cell and @xmath25 specifies the atom within the unit cell . the index `` 0 '' refers to the equilibrium positions of the nuclei .",
    "when the lattice atoms are oscillating , the position of the nucleus at position @xmath26 changes by a small displacement : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the displacement of the nucleus at equilibrium position @xmath26 . as a consequence ,",
    "the lattice potential changes as well and for small displacements @xmath28 the potential can be expanded into a taylor series : @xmath29 here , the sums run over all unit cells @xmath24 , all atoms @xmath25 within the unit cell , and all cartesian coordinates @xmath30 .",
    "the electronic hamiltonian thus acquires two more terms ( up to quadratic order in the displacement ) , describing the coupling of electrons to one and two phonons , respectively : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is given by the @xmath30th order term in the expansion of the potential given above .",
    "after quantizing the phonon field , the operator corresponding to a displacement of the atom at equilibrium position @xmath26 can be written as a superposition of the vibrational eigenmodes : @xmath33 \\mathrm{e}^{i \\mathbf{q } \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_n},\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath34 denote the quasimomentum and phonon branch ( e.g. @xmath34=to for the transverse optical branch ) of the eigenmode , respectively , @xmath35 is the position , i.e. , lattice site , of the @xmath24th unit cell , and @xmath36 is an operator that destroys ( creates ) one phonon of branch @xmath34 with quasimomentum @xmath11 .",
    "the vector @xmath37 denotes one of the two three - dimensional parts of the six - dimensional eigenvector of the dynamical matrix describing the displacement of atom @xmath25 of the unit cell .    to describe the raman scattering amplitude within perturbation theory",
    ", one needs the matrix elements of the electron - phonon hamiltonian for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states and for one or two specific phonons .",
    "for example , the matrix elements of the electron - one - phonon hamiltonian for a phonon of branch @xmath34 and with quasimomentum @xmath11 in the final state are given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 specify the electronic band and @xmath41 is a state consisting of an unperturbed electronic state specified by the band index @xmath39 and bloch wave vector @xmath42 and a phonon from branch @xmath34 with quasimomentum @xmath11 .",
    "for the raman spectrum of graphene , only the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands are important , i.e. @xmath43 and for every @xmath17 , @xmath11 , and @xmath34 the electron - phonon coupling matrix elements can be written as a 2@xmath102-matrix @xmath44 in the space of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands . +   + by the same procedure , one can obtain a 2@xmath102-matrix containing the matrix elements of the electron - two - phonon interaction hamiltonian @xmath45 . for the purpose of this chapter , only those matrix elements are important that contain the two phonons in the final state .",
    "again , these can conveniently written as a 2@xmath102 basis in the space of @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands , which we will denote by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the quantum numbers of phonon 1(2 )",
    ". +   + numerical values for the electron - phonon matrix elements can be obtained from density functional perturbation theory .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the underestimation of electron - electron interaction effects in dft leads to an underestimation of the electron - phonon matrix elements as well , especially for @xmath17 and @xmath11 near @xmath9 , where long - range electronic correlation effects play an important role . for specific @xmath17 and @xmath11 , such as @xmath49 ,",
    "it is possible to incorporate these effects by relating the electron - phonon matrix elements at these high - symmetry points to changes of the band energies when the lattice ions are displaced statically according to the phonon displacement pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : displacements]b . for instance , for a phonon from the to branch with quasimomentum @xmath50 , the square of the electron - phonon coupling for a @xmath2 and @xmath3 state with @xmath51 obeys  @xcite : @xmath52(d ) } { d } \\right)^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the amplitude of the displacement and @xmath54 is the energy of the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) band at @xmath9 when the atoms are displaced .",
    "when incorporating electron - electron interaction effects on the level of the @xmath8  approximation into the band energies , this procedure allows one to calculate the electron - phonon matrix elements at these high - symmetry points while taking into account correlation effects more accurately .",
    "this procedure , however , is limited to high - symmetry points for @xmath17 and @xmath11 as only there the electron - phonon matrix elements can be related to changes of the band energies .",
    "the final ingredient needed for a theoretical description of raman spectra is the coupling of electrons to light , i.e. an external electromagnetic field .",
    "an external electromagnetic field can be described in terms of a vector potential @xmath55 and a scalar potential @xmath56 . in coulomb",
    "gauge @xmath57 , the scalar potential must be zero for fields vanishing at infinity .",
    "the external electromagnetic field can therefore be described entirely in terms of a vector potential @xmath55 .",
    "the coulomb gauge imposes one constrain on @xmath55 , leaving two degrees of freedom for the external electromagnetic field , which can be identified with the two possible linearly independent polarization directions of light .",

    "@xmath71 , which is justified by the fact that the wave length of the light ( @xmath7300 - 800  nm for light in the visible spectrum ) is much larger than the typical crystal length scale given by the lattice constant ( @xmath72.46    for graphene ) , i.e. @xmath72 if @xmath20 varies on the crystal scale only as it does in the matrix elements between bloch states . in other words , for the description of raman spectra , we can treat the external photons as having zero wave vector ( i.e. we set @xmath73 ) , yet finite frequency .",
    "again , we will collect the matrix elements between the possible combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath3  states for fixed @xmath17 and light polarization @xmath62 in a 2@xmath102-matrix @xmath74 .",

    "the final building block needed for a complete description of the raman spectrum within the framework of perturbation theory is a description of electron - defect scattering .",
    "if the graphene sheet contains defects , electrons may scatter from them elastically , leading to additional observable peaks in the raman spectrum . since a first , qualitative understanding of these defect - assisted peaks does not require a detailed model for electron - defect scattering",

    "if we limit ourselves to a maximum of two phonons , these kinematic considerations lead to the following categorization of raman processes and their corresponding designations : +   + _ a ) _ one - phonon processes without defects ( @xmath0 peak ) + momentum conservation forces the phonon momentum to be equal to zero , i.e. the phonon must be a phonon from the brillouin zone center , i.e. the @xmath12 point .",
    "non - zero raman shifts further require the phonon to be an optical one since the frequencies of acoustic phonons vanish at @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , horizontal mirror symmetry forbids processes with one out - of - plane phonon .",

    "these are doubly degenerate due to rotation symmetry , i.e. they possess the same energy leading to the same raman shift for both .",
    "the corresponding peak in the raman spectrum , located at around 1580  @xmath18 in pristine graphene , is universally called the @xmath0 peak as it was first observed in graphite .",

    "it should be noted that due to the absence of a band gap in graphene , there are always electronic transitions that are in resonance with the energy of the incoming light .",
    "the condition for resonance is that the energy of the in- or outgoing light matches the energy of an electronic transition . to give an example of a resonant term appearing in the raman amplitude , we take a look at one of the terms contained in the matrix product of the first term of @xmath123 : @xmath132                                        \\left [ \\hbar(\\omega_{\\mathrm{in } } - \\omega_{\\mathrm{ph } } ) - ( \\varepsilon^{\\pi^*}_{\\mathbf{k}}-\\varepsilon^{\\pi}_{\\mathbf{k } } ) + \\frac{i}{2 } ( \\gamma^{\\pi}_{\\mathbf{k}}+\\gamma^{\\pi^*}_{\\mathbf{k } } + \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ph } } ) \\right ] } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we replaced the frequency of the outgoing light by the difference of the frequency of the incoming light and the phonon frequency and accounted for the finite lifetime of the phonon by adding a negative imaginary part to the phonon frequency .",

    "when the resonance condition @xmath133 is met , the denominator becomes minimal , leading to the resonant behavior .",
    "note that , since the band structure is monotonically increasing away from the fermi surface ( i.e. the @xmath9 point ) , the density of states increase monotonically with energy as well and hence the number of states that are in resonance with the energy of the incoming light increases with @xmath119 , leading to the observed strong behavior of @xmath134 as a function of @xmath119  @xcite . by contrast ,",
    "raman scattering in semi - conductors with sizable band gaps is mostly non - resonant , unless the excitation energy matches the energy of the band gap or an excitonic state within the gap , whereupon a strong resonance is recorded .",
    "+   + in the limit of small @xmath135 , the matrix element vanishes , which can easily be explained by the following argument : for small @xmath119 , the electronic states that are in resonance with the excitation energy are located very close to the @xmath9 point .",
    "however , very close to the @xmath9 point , the band structure of graphene can be considered to be conic ( the conic band structure is often called _ dirac cone _ due to the hamiltonian reducing to the dirac hamiltonian in this limit ) .",
    "a conic band structure has a continuous in - plane rotation symmetry , which implies angular momentum conservation .",
    "if we consider circularly polarized light and phonons at @xmath12 , each of them has an angular momentum of @xmath136 .",
    "the initial state thus has angular momentum @xmath137 , while the final state can have an angular momentum of @xmath138 , @xmath139 , or @xmath140 , which would violate angular momentum conservation .",
    "therefore , in the case of a conic band structure , the @xmath0 peak process would not be possible in leading order in perturbation theory as it would violate angular momentum conservation .",
    "if one goes one order beyond the linear , conic approximation for the band structure , however , the terms that break the continuous rotation symmetry down to the 120@xmath141 rotation symmetry of the lattice cause a _",
    "trigonal warping _ of the band structure .",
    "the reduced 120@xmath141 symmetry means that angular momentum is only conserved modulo @xmath142 , in other words , states with angular momenta that differ by an integer multiple of @xmath143 get mixed .",
    "this in turn leads to a non - vanishing raman amplitude at the leading order in perturbation theory , since now the total angular momenta of the initial and final states can differ by an integer multiple of @xmath143 and hence an incoming photon with angular momentum @xmath144 can generate a phonon and photon both with angular momentum @xmath145 .",
    "this argument also illustrates that it is important to go beyond the dirac cone approximation of the band structure when considering the @xmath0 peak and that it is necessary to include the trigonal warping terms , which make the @xmath0 peak process possible in the first place .      as a second example for the diagrammatic calculation of the raman spectrum ,",

    ", one finds  @xcite that the phonons that give the biggest contributions to the various raman peaks are a phonon from the to branch with @xmath11 near @xmath9 for the @xmath107  peak , and phonon from the lo branch with @xmath11 near @xmath12 for the @xmath108  peak and a phonon from the la branch with @xmath11 near @xmath9 for the @xmath176  peak .",
    "+   + finally , we want to point out that @xmath154 depends on the excitation frequency @xmath119 as mentioned before .",
    "since the phonon wave vector determines the resonant contribution and hence the position of the maximum of the peak , the two - phonon peaks will shift when the excitation frequency @xmath119 is varied , which leads to the these peaks being called _ dispersive_. in the approximation of a linear band structure ( i.e. a dirac cone ) and a linear phonon dispersion near @xmath9 and @xmath12 and for the resonant electron and phonon wave vectors being parallel along high - symmetry lines , the two conditions for double resonance become linear equations for @xmath177 and @xmath178 , which are also linear in @xmath119 .",
    "hence the solutions to these equations @xmath179 and @xmath180 are also linear in @xmath119 and because of the approximately linear dispersion of the phonons near @xmath9 and @xmath12 , the resonant phonon frequency and with it the peak position are linear in @xmath119 as well .",
    "this linear dispersion of the two - phonon frequencies has been observed experimentally , e.g. , in refs .   and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d - cones]b .",
    "note that contrary to the process for the @xmath0  peak , the raman amplitude does not vanish for a conic band structure , since the final state contains three particles ( one photon , two phonons ) , so that angular momentum conservation as implied by a conic band structure can always be obeyed .",
    "+   + so far we have focused on the double - resonant contribution to the raman amplitude and determined which phonon wave vectors @xmath11 maximize it , which in turn determines the raman shift at which the two - phonon raman peaks are observed . however , we want to stress that while the double - resonant terms are undoubtedly of high importance for a correct description of the raman peaks , quantum interference effects also play a crucial role in the correct description of the raman spectrum  @xcite .",
    "while the contributions of different phonons are added after squaring the matrix element ( different phonons mean different final states ) , the sum over electronic wave vectors @xmath17 has to be done before squaring the matrix element .",
    "as pointed out in the literature  @xcite , the doubly - resonant electronic states @xmath165 can constructively or destructively interfere with one another , which can significantly influence the peak shape and height .",
    "after the detailed discussion of defect - free processes in the last two subsections , we conclude this section by briefly addressing the defect - assisted processes . in the presence of defects , electron - phonon scattering events can be complemented or replaced by elastic electron - defect scattering events .",
    "for example , if one replaces one of the two electron - phonon scattering events in the defect - free two - phonon process by an electron - defect scattering event , one obtains a process that has one instead of two phonons in the final state .",
    "this phonon can in principle have an arbitrary wave vector @xmath11 , as already discussed in the section on kinematic constraints . a simple way to obtain the amplitude for such a process is to replace the electron - phonon(-light ) matrix element that involves the second phonon by one of the defect - scattering amplitudes and set the corresponding phonon frequency in the denominator to zero .",
    "while the double resonance conditions that involve the second phonon can thus no longer be fulfilled , the double resonance conditions that involve the first phonon , however , are unaffected by this .",
    "therefore , the corresponding raman process will still be doubly resonant for the same phonon wave vectors @xmath168 , we found for the two - phonon , defect - free case above .",
    "accordingly , the maximum of the corresponding raman peak will be located at the position of the frequency of the resonant wave vectors .",
    "compared to the defect - free two - phonon process involving two phonons of the same branch , where the raman shift of the peak maximum is given by the sum of the frequencies of the two phonons , the raman shift for the corresponding one - phonon , defect - assisted peak will thus be halved .",
    "this explains the designation @xmath1 and @xmath104 for two of the two-(same-)phonon peaks as their corresponding defect - assisted peaks are denoted @xmath107 ( for resonant phonons of the to branch with @xmath11 near @xmath9 ) and @xmath108 ( for resonant phonons of the la branch near @xmath12 ) , respectively . since the double resonance conditions are the same for the two - phonon process and one - phonon process with defects , the position of the raman peaks of the latter also depend on the excitation frequency @xmath119 .",
    "in addition to the matrix element squared , the intensity of the defect - assisted peaks will also contain a factor of the defect concentration  @xcite .",
    "this direct linear dependence of the height of the peak on the defect concentration is easily understandable since the height of the peak is proportional to the probability per unit time of the corresponding raman process .",
    "since the latter requires a defect to be non - zero , the probability per unit time for the process to happen is proportional to the defect concentration and hence the peak height is as well . a more detailed discussion of the dependence of the intensity of theses peaks can be found in the final section of this chapter .",
    "finally , there are also raman processes which involve two phonons and additional electron - defect scattering events .",
    "this allows for more and different conditions for double resonance , leading to several raman sidebands and peaks , the most prominent of which is the @xmath109 peak .",
    "in the final section of this chapter , we discuss how various internal properties ( e.g. defects or layer number ) of a graphene sample or externally controllable parameters ( e.g. doping or strain ) influence the raman spectrum .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the discussion of the arguably most common and arguably best understood external influences , namely the number of layers , the defect concentration , doping , and strain .",
    "other influences not covered here include disorder and edge effects  @xcite , substrate influences  @xcite , and temperature  @xcite , for which the interested reader is referred to the literature .      in the previous parts of this chapter , we were only concerned with monolayer graphene .",
    "while it is still by far the most often studied graphene system in contemporary research and allows one to illustrate the general theoretical approach to the calculation of raman spectra , multi - layer graphene also has received some attention in the literature . indeed , one important application of raman spectroscopy is the determination of the number of layers during sample exfoliation or growth .",
    "we therefore briefly summarize the most important changes to the raman spectrum if the sample consists not of one but of several layers of graphene .    by increasing the number of layers , the number of atoms in the unit cell changes by 2 for each additional layer .",
    "the number of atoms in the unit cell determines the number of ( optical ) phonon branches . for @xmath181 atoms in the unit cell",
    "the number of optical branches is given by @xmath182 , two thirds of which are in - plane phonons .",
    "however , almost across the whole brillouin zone , the new phonon branches that are relevant for raman scattering are degenerate with the ones already existing in monolayer graphene . only near the @xmath9 point do the elsewhere degenerate to branches split slightly  @xcite .    by contrast ,",
    "the electronic band structure , undergoes a more severe change .",
    "both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands split into @xmath181 bands each .",
    "as the different layers of multilayer graphene are bound mostly by van der waals  forces , which are much weaker than the intralayer covalent forces , the splitting of the additional bands is small compared to the energy scale of the bands .",
    "thus all of these bands now play a role in the raman processes .    by taking both the changes to the phonon dispersion and the electronic band structure into account",
    ", we can summarize the changes to the various raman processes and peaks as follows : +   + for the one - phonon , defect - free process , i.e. the @xmath0  peak , very little change is observed as the position and decay width of the degenerate phonon at @xmath12 are as good as unchanged .",
    "the separation in energy of the additional bands from the monolayer ones is so large that the additional possible electronic transitions have transition energies out of range of the phonon .",
    "hence they couple only weakly to it , which means that the frequency and decay width of the phonon at @xmath12 are not measurably different from the monolayer ones .",
    "for the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted processes , however , the situation is different .",
    "recall that the existence of a clear peak in monolayer graphene is attributed to the fact that for certain electron wave vectors @xmath165 and phonon wave vectors @xmath168 the raman amplitude becomes double resonant .",
    "the additional electronic bands in multilayer graphene allow for additional double - resonance conditions with slightly different solutions @xmath165 and @xmath168 ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : layer - number]a for an example of a double - resonant process in the case of bilayer graphene ) .",
    "in addition , the slight splitting of the to branch of the phonon dispersion for @xmath11 near @xmath9 further allows for different @xmath168 .",
    "altogether , this leads to more phonon wave vectors @xmath11 that satisfy a double resonance condition and hence several close - by phonon frequencies now contribute significantly to the observed raman shift .",
    "this leads to a measurable broadening of the two - phonon and defect - assisted peaks , in particular to a splitting / broadening of the most prominent peak , the @xmath1  peak . as expected from the above considerations , the broadening of these peaks increases with every additional number of layers  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : layer - number]b ) and converges towards the peak structure of bulk graphite .",
    "the broadening of the @xmath1  peak in particular is nowadays routinely used to reliably estimate the number of layers during sample exfoliation or growth .      as already mentioned before",
    ", the presence of defects in a graphene sample changes the raman spectrum in two ways : on the one hand , it leads to more peaks in the spectrum as the defect - assisted raman processes become possible . on the other hand",
    ", it modifies the height and widths of the non - defect - assisted peaks . for both groups of raman peaks",
    ", we will briefly discuss the dependence of their height and width on the defect concentration in this subsection .",
    "+   + for the _ defect - assisted _ peaks , e.g. the @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109  peaks , the peak height and width depends non - monotonically on the defect concentration @xmath183 .",
    "firstly , there is the direct dependence of the intensity on @xmath183 , which appears as a scaling factor in the intensity .",
    "this factor represents the fact that the probability for a defect - assisted raman process is proportional to the number of defects .",
    "secondly , there is the indirect dependence of the quantum mechanical amplitude on @xmath183 through the decay widths , i.e. , the lifetimes , of the intermediate electronic states , @xmath184 , which appear in the denominator of the matrix element of the raman process and thus higher widths lead to smaller quantum mechanical amplitudes . in general , the decay widths of electronic states contains several contributions related to the different ways in which an electron can scatter .",
    "the three most prominent ones are electron - electron interaction , i.e. , coulomb scattering with another electron , electron - phonon interaction , i.e. , activation of a lattice vibration , and scattering from a defect .",
    "the latter contribution to the total decay width of an electronic state will be proportional to @xmath183 , as more defects leads to a higher probability for an electron to scatter from a defect .",
    "depending on the defect concentration , the first or the second aspect will dominate  @xcite .    for high defect concentrations , the electronic decay widths will be dominated by electron - defect scattering and hence will be proportional to @xmath183 . since the electronic decay widths appear in each of the multiple factors in the denominator of the raman matrix element , this effect will eventually outweigh the overall linear factor of @xmath183 appearing in the expression for the raman intensity .",
    "therefore , for large enough densities , the heights of the defect - assisted peaks will decrease .    while the peak heights thus behave non - monotonically as a function of @xmath183 , the peak widths monotonically increase with @xmath183 .",
    "here , the only relevant effect is the increase of the electronic decay widths with @xmath183 . as discussed before",
    ", the broadening of the electronic states leads to a smearing of the resonance condition and hence a wider range of phonon frequencies will non - negligibly contribute to the raman peaks .",
    "thus , the widths of the peaks increase monotonically with defect concentration . +   + the properties of the _ non - defect - assisted _ peaks on the other hand , depend on the defect concentration in a purely monotonic fashion .",
    "their intensities monotonically decrease as a function of the defect concentration , since they only depend on @xmath183 through the decay widths of the electronic states , which enter the quantum mechanical matrix element through factors in the denominator . since for low defect concentrations , the dependence of the electronic decay widths on @xmath183 is negligible , the height of the non - defect - assisted peaks is independent of the defect concentration as well for low @xmath183 .",
    "the different behavior of the intensity of the defect - assisted and non - defect - assisted peaks as a function of @xmath183 has been used to estimate the amount of defects and disorder in a sample by measuring the ratio of the intensity of the @xmath107 and @xmath0  peaks  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : defect - influences ] ) .     and @xmath0 peaks as a function of the average distance between defects @xmath185 , which is a measure for the defect concentration @xmath183 .",
    "( figure taken from ref .  .",
    ") ]    the behavior of the widths of the defect - free peaks under changes of @xmath183 depends on the specific peak . the width of the @xmath0  peak , as shown in the previous section , does not depend on the electronic decay widths as it is purely determined by the lifetime of the created phonon .",
    "the widths of the multi - phonon peaks , such as the @xmath1 , @xmath104 , or @xmath105  peaks , by contrast , increases with @xmath183 , for the same reason as for the defect - assisted peaks .",
    "doping , i.e. , changes of the charge carrier density , leads to a shift of the fermi level .",
    "hole ( @xmath186-type ) doping leads to states in the @xmath2  band not being occupied , while electron ( @xmath24-type ) doping causes states in the @xmath3  band to be occupied .",
    "this will influence the raman spectrum in three ways : +    firstly , the electronic band structure is slightly affected as the screening of the electron - electron interaction is increased by the presence of additional charge carriers .",
    "the most important effect of this is decrease of the slope of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands near the @xmath9 point  @xcite .",
    "this effects the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted raman processes by changing the condition for double resonance .",
    "an additional effect is the increase of the decay width of excited electronic states ( or equivalently a decrease of their lifetime ) @xmath126 , as the scattering rate of an electron due to electron - electron interaction increases with additional charge carriers in the system .",
    "this will affect the height of the raman peaks and correspondingly their area , since they are proportional to the matrix element squared of the corresponding raman process , which in turn decreases for higher decay widths of the electronic states as they appear in the denominator of the amplitude .",
    "since the amplitude for the two - phonon processes ( e.g. , the @xmath1  peak process ) contains one more electronic green s functions than the amplitude for the one - phonon , defect - free process ( leading to the @xmath0  peak ) , it contains one more factor of @xmath126 , and hence the height and area of the two - phonon peaks reduces much more with doping than the height and area of the @xmath0  peak  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the height , the width of the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted peaks changes as well as experimentally observed for the @xmath1  peak  @xcite , since it is also related to the electronic decay width , as mentioned in the last section . +   + secondly , the phonon frequencies and widths change .",
    "this is most noticeable for those phonons which are affected by kohn anomalies : the degenerate optical in - plane phonons at @xmath12 and the to branch at and around @xmath9 .",
    "the phonon at @xmath12 is affected by doping through a change of its _ self - energy _ ,",
    "i.e. , its change of frequency due to electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the commonly associated picture behind this is the phonon s temporary decay into an electron - hole pair which recombines to produce the same phonon again .",
    "this process is only relevant if the electron or the hole have not been scattered in the meantime , i.e. , if they are long - lived enough or , equivalently , if their decay width is low enough .",
    "otherwise this virtual process does not play a role as recombination to the original phonon is not possible .",
    "the decay width is low enough if it is much lower than the transition energy of the electron - hole pair which is equal to the energy of the phonon .",
    "to put it the other way around , for this process to play a role , the lifetime of the excited electron or the hole must be much longer than than the period of the phonon oscillation .",
    "if this is the case , the nuclei are oscillating while the electron stays in its exciting state without instantly dropping back to the ground state and without adiabatically following the nuclei , as assumed in the adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation . in graphene ,",
    "the decay widths of the exited electron and the hole are indeed much lower compared to the phonon energy , leading to the statement that the adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation breaks down in graphene  @xcite . with doping ,",
    "the occupation of the excited states and holes is changed and this in turn changes the self - energy of the phonon , resulting in an increase of the phonon frequencies of the degenerate optical branches at @xmath12  @xcite , which means that the position of the @xmath0  peak shifts towards higher frequencies , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : doping - influences]a .",
    "note that in other materials , the ratio of electronic decay widths and phonon frequencies is usually much larger than in graphene and hence the exited electrons and holes have time to relax to the ground state and adiabatically follow the oscillating nuclei and hence the self - energy correction in other materials is negligible .    at the same time",
    ", doping also blocks a possible decay channel of the phonons , by preventing the decay into an electron - hole pair due to the pauli principle .",
    "if the fermi level exceeds half of the phonon energy , than the decay into an electron and a hole with each carrying away half of the phonon energy becomes impossible due to the pauli exclusion principle since the electronic state that would be occupied after the decay is already occupied due to doping .",
    "thus , if the fermi level exceeds half of the phonon energy , the phonon decay widths drops noticeably ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : doping - influences]b ) , as the decay channel into electron - hole pairs makes up a sizable part of the total decay width of the phonons . in the case of finite temperature",
    ", this sharp drop of the decay width is smeared out with the fermi - dirac distribution . the strong decrease of the decay width of the phonon at @xmath12 with doping directly amounts to a strong decrease of the width of the raman @xmath0  peak , since the latter is equal to the decay width of the phonon , as explained in the theoretical section . by monitoring the @xmath0  peak width ,",
    "one thus has a qualitative measure to check if the fermi level exceeds half of the phonon energy .",
    "+   + for the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted peaks , the physical picture is roughly the same as for the @xmath0  peak .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the phonons involved in the processes leading to the @xmath107 , @xmath176 , @xmath105 and , most importantly , the @xmath1  peak have wave vectors near @xmath9 . in the vicinity of @xmath9",
    ", effects of the kohn anomaly play an important role since it leads to steepening of the slope of the phonon dispersion , which plays an important role in determining which phonons obey the double - resonance conditions and hence where the center of the raman peaks is situated .",
    "the kohn anomaly is very sensitive to the fermi surface and thus a change of the fermi level through doping means that it has a large influence on the phonon dispersion around @xmath9 and consequently on the position of the raman peaks .",
    "indeed , it is found experimentally that the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted peaks  @xcite shift with doping , albeit not as strongly as the @xmath0  peak .    the decay width of the phonons that fulfill the double - resonance condition , on the other hand",
    ", are not affected for low doping levels .",
    "the finite momentum of these phonons does not allow the phonon to decay into an electron - hole pair due to energy and momentum conservation , as the necessary hole states would have to have an energy of around half of the laser energy for which the phonon fulfills the double - resonance condition . for typical experimental laser energies of 2 - 3  ev , it would require a fermi level shift of 1 - 1.5  ev to block the decay width of the phonons involved in the doubly resonant process .",
    "the influence of doping on the decay widths of the phonons can thus be neglected for typical doping levels achieved in experiment .",
    "+   + finally , doping influences the raman amplitudes directly .",
    "as seen in the previous section , the raman amplitudes contain factors of the fermi - dirac distribution of the involved electronic states . by changing the fermi level and thus varying the occupation of the electronic states , some of the raman amplitudes",
    "are set to zero . for the @xmath0  peak amplitude , which does not rely primarily on the resonant terms to exist , doping in general",
    "has only minor effects .",
    "it has been demonstrated experimentally however  @xcite , that if the fermi level comes close to half of the frequency of the outgoing light , the total amplitude for the @xmath0  peak process increases dramatically .",
    "the underlying reason for this increase is the blocking of terms in the amplitude that destructively interfere with the resonant terms , leading to a large _ increase _ of the amplitude , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : doping - influences]c .    for the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted processes",
    ", the situation is different . here",
    ", the interference between the different terms in the amplitude is believed to be constructive  @xcite and therefore raising the fermi level to half of the frequency of the light only leads to a sharp _ decrease _ of the peak height and ultimately to its disappearance , as has been demonstrated for the @xmath1  peak .",
    "+   + we can summarize the effects of doping on the raman spectrum as follows : the @xmath0  peak is expected to shift to a higher frequency . in addition , it will narrow once the fermi level is bigger than @xmath187 or lower than @xmath188 , with the width of the peak decreasing to as low as 4 - 5  @xmath18  @xcite . the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted peaks , in particular the @xmath1  peak , are expected to shift as well , albeit not as strong as the @xmath0  peak .",
    "furthermore the ratio of the areas of the @xmath1 and @xmath0  peaks decreases as well with doping .",
    "mechanical strain has a large influence on the raman spectrum .",
    "this is hardly surprising as it changes the bond lengths of the atoms , which leads to both a change in the phonon frequencies as the effective springs between the atoms are softened or hardened and to a change in the electronic band structure since the unit cell becomes distorted and hence the brillouin zone does as well .",
    "the @xmath0  peak is less affected by these changes than the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted peaks as the electronic structure only directly influences the intensity , i.e. , the peak height . the peak position and width , by contrast",
    ", are only determined by the frequency and width of the degenerate optical phonons at @xmath12 .",
    "the width of these phonons remains almost completely unaffected by strain since it is mostly determined by the decay of the phonon into electron - hole pairs .",
    "the position , however , is rather sensitive to strain since it equal to the frequency of the phonon .",
    "as mentioned before , strain leads to a change of the bond strength between the atoms , which in turn modifies the effective spring constant between the atoms and hence the phonon frequency . in general , compressive strain leads to a hardening of the bonds as the charge density becomes higher between the atoms thus binding the atoms stronger together , which results in a higher phonon frequency and therefore a larger raman shift .",
    "tensile strain , on the other hand , leads to the opposite effect and reduces the phonon frequency and the raman shift . for experimentally accessible strain values ,",
    "the relation between raman shift of the @xmath0  peak and strain is a linear one , with the constant of proportionality given by the _ grneisen _",
    "parameter for the in - plane optical phonon at @xmath12 .",
    "+   + the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted peaks such as the @xmath1  peak , however , undergo a larger change with strain . here , both the change in the phonon frequencies and the distortion of the electronic band structure play a role . when the electronic band structure is distorted , the conditions for double resonance are changed . when combined with the change of the phonon frequencies this leads to much larger shift of the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted peak positions with strain compared to that of the @xmath0  peak .",
    "+   + additionally , one has to distinguish between _ uniaxial _ strain and _ biaxial _ strain :    _ uniaxial _ strain means that strain is applied along a specific direction .",
    "the fact that a specific direction is now singled out has a big influence on the various raman peaks . for the @xmath0  peak ,",
    "the most important effect is the lifting of the degeneracy of the in - plane optical phonon frequencies at @xmath12 . in unstrained graphene ,",
    "the two in - plane optical phonon branches are degenerate at @xmath12 because of rotation symmetry . by singling out a specific direction ,",
    "uniaxial strain breaks this rotation symmetry and as a result the two phonon branches split . since the raman peak corresponding to one - phonon , defect - free processes",
    "is due to the emission of an in - plane optical phonon at @xmath12 , the @xmath0  peak splits into two peaks corresponding to the two now non - degenerate phonon branches .",
    "the difference between these two phonon frequencies is proportional to the applied strain and for low strain ( @xmath1890.7%  @xcite ) , the peak splitting is too small compared to the width of the phonons to be observable . only for higher strain values",
    "does one record a clearly visible peak splitting , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain - influences]a .    for the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted peaks , uniaxial strain can also cause observable peak splitting .",
    "the mechanism , however , is a different one than that for the @xmath0  peak .",
    "the observed peak splitting of , for example , the @xmath1  peak has its roots in a breaking of the threefold rotation symmetry of the resonance surface of the electron and phonon wave vectors . recall that the phonons mostly contributing to the peak are determined from resonance conditions derived in the previous section .",
    "these resonance conditions can be fulfilled or approximately fulfilled by a whole set of wave vectors for the electrons and phonons , which however obey the lattice symmetries . by breaking the threefold rotation symmetry of the lattice by applying uniaxial strain ,",
    "the shape of the resonance surfaces in the brillouin zone is distorted and this leads to different phonon wave vectors that satisfy them that correspond to phonon frequencies that are a bit separated from each other .",
    "this leads to the observation of a splitting in the two - phonon and/or defect - assisted bands , as has been measured , for example , for the @xmath1  peak  @xcite ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : strain - influences]b ) as in the case of the @xmath0  peak , the applied uniaxial strain has to be large enough to observe such a splitting with the threshold value being roughly in the same range as for the @xmath0  peak .",
    "it should be noted that , for a low - quality graphene sheet and/or an unfortunate choice of substrate , the intrinsic width of the raman peaks can be too large to allow the peak splitting to be observed .",
    "instead one will only measure a further broadening of the peaks ( compare for instance ref .  , where no @xmath1  peak splitting was observed , and ref .  , where it was observed ) .",
    "_ biaxial _ strain , on the other hand , does not lead to the splitting of the raman peaks . due to the hexagonal lattice structure , biaxial strain leads mostly only to a uniform stretching or contraction of the unit cell and",
    "does not break the rotation symmetry in a major way .",
    "therefore , both mechanisms described in the previous paragraph do not apply in the case of biaxial strain and the raman bands do not split .",
    "however , the mechanism that leads to a shift of the peaks remains applicable .",
    "as one would very naively expect , the change of the peak positions for a given amount of strain is indeed much larger for biaxial strain than for uniaxial strain   @xcite .",
    "+   + finally , we want to point out that while strain and doping both lead to a shift of the positions of the various peaks , it has recently been demonstrated that it is possible to disentangle these two sources of peak shifts  @xcite . by focusing on the positions of @xmath0 and @xmath1  peaks , one can exploit the fact that the two peak shifts are linearly correlated , both for doping and strain as the source of the peak shifts . the ratio of the two shifts , however , depends on the source of the shifts : for hole doping , the ratio of the @xmath1 and @xmath0  peak shifts is roughly @xmath190 . for electron doping ,",
    "the slope is much slower and deviates soon from the linear trend . for strain , the @xmath1  peak , as being related to a two - phonon raman process ,",
    "is subject to much larger changes of the position compared to the @xmath0  peak , with the experimentally extracted ratio of the peak shifts given by @xmath191 . under the assumption that the doping- and strain - induced shift are simply additive and not correlated",
    ", one can project the coordinates of a point in the @xmath192-@xmath193 plane onto the axes of slopes 0.7 and 2.2 and separate the doping- and strain - induced shifts ( compare fig .  [",

    "this chapter has given a glimpse at the rich variety of phenomena that occur in raman spectroscopy of graphene .",

    "however , we have seen that kinematic considerations and a careful look at the matrix elements and energy denominators allow in many cases an intuitive understanding of the raman spectrum without explicit calculations .",
    "the @xmath0  line position is given by the @xmath194 phonon frequency at @xmath12 and thus it does not disperse as a function of the laser energy .",
    "its position and width are sensitive measures for doping and strain . at the same time it remains largely unaffected by defects and by the number of layers .",
    "the @xmath1  line , by contrast , disperses as a function of the laser wave length .",
    "its splitting into subpeaks ( sometimes only seen as an increased broadening of the line ) is , in particular , used as a convenient measure for the number of layers in the sample .",
    "its position is also affected by strain , but only moderately by doping .",
    "the intensity of defect related peaks is a direct measure of the defect concentration in the sample .",
    "one of the main challenges for quantitative calculations is still the absolute position and the width of the @xmath1  line ( and thus also of the @xmath107  line ) .",
    "the difficulties are twofold : ( i ) a fully _ ab initio _ calculation of the highest optical phonon branch around @xmath9 is still missing ( only the linear slope at @xmath9 has been determined quantitatively using the @xmath8  approximation ) .",
    "( ii ) the width is a result of both the effect of k - space integration and also depends on the various broadenings of intermediate electron and hole states as well as on the phonon frequency .    for the time",
    "being , _ ab initio _ calculations of the raman spectrum of graphene ( such as , for example , the calculation presented in ref .  )",
    "still rely on the input of phonon and electron lifetimes as semi - empirical parameters .",
    "all the lifetimes ( due to electron - electron , electron - phonon , and phonon - phonon interaction ) can , in principle , be calculated , but calculations remain quite expensive in terms of computing time . with the increasing available computing power and recent progress in code development for lifetime calculations , we are optimistic that a fully _ ab initio _ calculation of the raman spectrum of graphene can be achieved in the near future .",
