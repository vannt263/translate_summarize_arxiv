    "one of the key goals in modern cosmology is to study the assembly process of the first galaxies , and understand how the first stars and stellar systems formed at the end of the cosmic dark ages , a few hundred million years after the big bang . with the formation of the first stars , the so - called population  iii ( pop  iii )",
    ", the universe was rapidly transformed into an increasingly complex , hierarchical system , due to the energy and heavy elements they released into the intergalactic medium ( igm ; for recent reviews , see barkana & loeb 2001 ; miralda - escud ; bromm & larson 2004 ; ciardi & ferrara 2005 ; glover 2005 ) .",
    "currently , we can directly probe the state of the universe roughly a million years after the big bang by detecting the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , thus providing us with the initial conditions for subsequent structure formation .",
    "complementary to the cmb observations , we can probe cosmic history all the way from the present - day universe to roughly a billion years after the big bang , using the best available ground- and space - based telescopes . in between lies the remaining frontier , and the first galaxies are the sign - posts of this early , formative epoch .",
    "there are a number of reasons why addressing the formation of the first galaxies and understanding second - generation star formation is important .",
    "first , a rigorous connection between well - established structure formation models at high redshift and the properties of present - day galaxies is still missing .",
    "an understanding of how the first galaxies formed could be a crucial step towards undertanding the formation of more massive systems .",
    "second , the initial burst of pop  iii star formation may have been rather brief due to the strong negative feedback effects that likely acted to self - limit this formation mode ( madau et al .",
    "2001 ; ricotti & ostriker 2004 ; yoshida et al . 2004 ; greif & bromm 2006 ) .",
    "second - generation star formation , therefore , might well have been cosmologically dominant compared to pop  iii stars . despite their importance for cosmic evolution , e.g. , by possibly constituting the majority of sources for the initial stages of reionization at @xmath1 , we currently do not know the properties , and most importantly the typical mass scale , of the second - generation stars that formed in the wake of the very first stars . finally , a subset of second - generation stars , those with masses below @xmath2 , would have survived to the present day .",
    "surveys of extremely metal - poor galactic halo stars therefore provide an indirect window into the pop  iii era by scrutinizing their chemical abundance patterns , which reflect the enrichment from a single , or at most a small multiple of , pop  iii supernovae ( sne ; christlieb et al .",
    "2002 ; beers & christlieb 2005 ; frebel et al .",
    ". stellar archaeology thus provides unique empirical constraints for numerical simulations , from which one can derive theoretical abundance patterns to be compared with the data .    focusing on numerical simulations as the key driver of structure formation theory ,",
    "the best strategy is to start with cosmological initial conditions , follow the evolution up to the formation of a small number ( @xmath3 ) of pop  iii stars , and trace the ensuing expansion of sn blast waves together with the dispersal and mixing of the first heavy elements , towards the formation of second - generation stars out of enriched material ( greif et al .",
    "2007 ; wise & abel 2007a ) . in this sense",
    "some of the most pressing questions are : how does radiative and mechanical feedback by the very first stars in minihalos affect the formation of the first galaxies ? how and when does metal enrichment govern the transition to low - mass star formation ?",
    "is there a critical metallicity at which this transition occurs ?",
    "how does turbulence affect the chemical mixing and fragmentation of the gas ?",
    "these questions have been addressed with detailed numerical simulations as well as analytic arguments over the last few years , and we here review some of the most recent work . for consistency , all quoted distances are physical , unless noted otherwise .",
    "feedback by the very first stars in minihalos plays an important role for the subsequent build - up of the first galaxies . among the most prominent mechanisms",
    "are ionizing and molecule - dissociating radiation emitted by massive pop  iii.1 stars , as well as the mechanical and chemical feedback exerted by the first sne . in the next few sections ,",
    "we briefly discuss these mechanisms in turn .",
    "star formation in primordial gas is believed to produce very massive stars . during their brief lifetimes of @xmath4",
    ", they produce @xmath5 ionizing photons per stellar baryon and thus have a significant impact on their environment ( bromm et al . 2001b ; schaerer 2002 ) . based on the large optical depth measured by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) after one year of operation ,",
    "wyithe & loeb ( 2003 ) suggested that the universe was reionized by massive metal - free stars .",
    "even though the reionization depth according to _ wmap _  5 decreased significantly ( komatsu et al . 2008 ; nolta et al .",
    "2008 ) , recent reionization studies indicate that massive stars are still required ( schleicher et al .",
    "considering different reionization scenarios with and without additional physics like primordial magnetic fields , they showed that stellar populations according to a scalo - type initial mass function ( imf ; scalo 1998 ) are ruled out within @xmath6 , unless very high star formation efficiencies of order @xmath7 are adopted . on the contrary , populations of very massive stars or mixed populations",
    "can easily provide the required optical depth .",
    "apart from their ionizing flux , pop  iii.1 stars also emit a strong flux of h@xmath8-dissociating lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation ( bromm et al . 2001b ; schaerer 2002 ) .",
    "thus , the radiation from the first stars dramatically influences their surroundings , heating and ionizing the gas within a few kiloparsec around the progenitor , and destroying the h@xmath8 and hd molecules locally within somewhat larger regions ( ferrara 1998 ; kitayama et al .",
    "2004 ; whalen et al . 2004 ; alvarez et al . 2006 ; abel et al .",
    "2007 ; johnson et al .",
    "additionally , the lw radiation emitted by the first stars could propagate across cosmological distances , allowing the build - up of a pervasive lw background radiation field ( haiman et al .",
    "the impact of radiation from the first stars on their local surroundings has important implications for the numbers and types of pop  iii stars that form .",
    "the photoheating of gas in the minihalos hosting pop  iii.1 stars drives strong outflows , lowering the density of the primordial gas and delaying subsequent star formation by up to @xmath9 ( whalen et al .",
    "2004 ; johnson et al . 2007 ; yoshida et al . 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , neighboring minihalos may be photoevaporated , delaying star formation in such systems as well ( shapiro et al .",
    "2004 ; susa & umemura 2006 ; ahn & shapiro 2007 ; greif et al . 2007",
    "; whalen et al .",
    "the photodissociation of molecules by lw photons emitted from local star - forming regions will , in general , act to delay star formation by destroying the main coolants that allow the gas to collapse and form stars .",
    "the photoionization of primordial gas , however , can ultimately lead to the production of copious amounts of molecules within the relic h  ii regions surrounding the remnants of pop  iii.1 stars ( figure  1 ; see also ricotti et al .",
    "2001 ; oh & haiman 2002 ; nagakura & omukai 2005 ; johnson & bromm 2007 ) .",
    "recent simulations tracking the formation of , and radiative feedback from , individual pop  iii.1 stars in the early stages of the assembly of the first galaxies have demonstrated that the accumulation of relic h  ii regions has two important effects .",
    "first , the hd abundance that develops in relic h  ii regions allows the primordial gas to re - collapse and cool to the temperature of the cmb , possibly leading to the formation of pop  iii.2 stars in these regions ( johnson et al .",
    "2007 ; yoshida et al . 2007 ; greif et al .",
    "second , the molecule abundance in relic h  ii regions , along with their increasing volume - filling fraction , leads to a large optical depth to lw photons over physical distances of the order of several kiloparsecs .",
    "the development of a high optical depth to lw photons over such short length - scales suggests that the optical depth to lw photons over cosmological scales may be very high , acting to suppress the build - up of a background lw radiation field , and mitigating negative feedback on star formation .",
    "even absent a large optical depth to lw photons , pop  iii.1 stars in minihalos may readily form at @xmath10 . while star formation in more massive systems may proceed relatively unimpeded , through atomic line cooling , during the earliest epochs of star formation these atomic - cooling halos are rare compared to the minihalos which host individual pop  iii stars .",
    "although the process of star formation in atomic cooling halos is not well understood , for a broad range of models the dominant contribution to the lw background is from pop  iii.1 stars formed in minihalos at @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , at these redshifts the lw background radiation may be largely self - regulated , with pop  iii.1 stars producing the very radiation which , in turn , suppresses their formation .",
    "johnson et al .",
    "2008 argue that there is a critical value for the lw flux , @xmath12 , at which pop iii.1 star formation occurs self - consistently , with the implication that the pop  iii.1 star formation rate in minihalos at @xmath10 is decreased by only a factor of a few .",
    "simulations of the formation of the first galaxies at @xmath13 which take into account the effect of a lw background at @xmath14 show that pop  iii.1 star formation takes place before the galaxy is fully assembled , suggesting that the formation of the first galaxies does indeed take place after chemical enrichment by the first sn explosions ( greif et al .",
    "2007 ; wise & abel 2007a ; johnson et al . 2008",

    "2008b ) .     and",

    "the light and dark shades of blue denote regions with a free electron fraction of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , while the shades of green denote regions with an h@xmath8 fraction of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , in order of decreasing brightness .",
    "the regions with the highest molecule abundances lie within relic h  ii regions , which thus play an important role for subsequent star formation , allowing molecules to become shielded from photodissociating radiation and altering the cooling properties of the primordial gas ( see johnson et al .",
    "2007).,width=453 ]      numerical simulations have indicated that pop  iii.1 stars might become as massive as @xmath20 ( omukai & palla 2003 ; bromm & loeb 2004 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2006 ; oshea & norman 2007 ) . after their main - sequence lifetimes of typically @xmath21",
    ", stars with masses below @xmath22 are thought to collapse directly to black holes without significant metal ejection , while in the range @xmath23 a pair - instability supernova ( pisn ) disrupts the entire progenitor , with explosion energies ranging from @xmath24 , and yields of order @xmath25 ( heger & woosley 2002 ; heger et al .",
    "less massive primordial stars with a high degree of angular momentum might explode with similar energies , but as jet - like hypernovae ( umeda & nomoto 2002 ; tominaga et al .",
    "the significant mechanical and chemical feedback effects exerted by such explosions have been investigated with a number of detailed calculations , but these were either performed in one dimension ( salvaterra 2004 ; kitayama & yoshida 2005 ; machida et al . 2005 ; whalen et al 2008b ) , or did not start from realistic initial conditions ( bromm et al .",
    "2003 ; norman et al .",
    "recent work treated the full three - dimensional problem in a cosmological context at the cost of limited resolution , finding that the sn remnant propagated for a hubble time at @xmath26 to a final mass - weighted mean shock radius of @xmath27 , roughly half the size of the h  ii region ( greif et al . 2007 ) . due to the high explosion energy ,",
    "the host halo was entirely evacuated .",
    "additional simulations in the absence of a sn explosion were performed to investigate the effect of photoheating and the impact of the sn shock on neighboring minihalos . for the case discussed in greif et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the sn remnant exerted positive mechanical feedback on neighboring minihalos by shock - compressing their cores , while photoheating marginally delayed star formation .",
    "although a viable theoretical possibility , secondary star formation in the dense shell via gravitational fragmentation ( e.g. machida et al . 2005 ; mackey et al . 2003 ; salvaterra et al .",
    "2004 ) was not observed , primarily due to the previous photoheating by the progenitor and the rapid adiabatic expansion of the shocked gas .",
    "the dispersal of metals by the first sn explosions transformed the igm from a simple , pure h / he gas to one with ubiquituous metal enrichment .",
    "the resulting cooling ultimately enabled the formation of the first low - mass stars ",
    "the key question is then when and where this transition occurred .",
    "as indicated in the previous section , such a transition could only occur well after the explosion , as cooling by metal lines or dust requires the gas to re - collapse to high densities .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of metals becomes highly anisotropic , since the shocked gas expands preferentially into the voids around the host halo .",
    "due to the high temperature and low density of the shocked gas , dark matter ( dm ) halos with @xmath28 must be assembled to efficiently mix the gas .",
    "for this reason , the first galaxies likely mark the formation environments of the first low - mass stars and stellar clusters ( see section  5 ) .",
    "how massive were the first galaxies , and when did they emerge ?",
    "theory predicts that dm halos containing a mass of @xmath29 and collapsing at @xmath30 were the hosts for the first bona fide galaxies .",
    "these systems are special in that their associated virial temperature exceeds the threshold , @xmath31 , for cooling due to atomic hydrogen ( oh & haiman 2002 ) .",
    "these so - called ` atomic - cooling halos ' did not rely on the presence of molecular hydrogen to enable cooling of the primordial gas .",
    "in addition , their potential wells were sufficiently deep to retain photoheated gas , in contrast to the shallow potential wells of minihalos ( madau et al .",
    "2001 ; mori et al . 2002 ; dijkstra et al .",
    "these are arguably minimum requirements to set up a self - regulated process of star formation that comprises more than one generation of stars , and is embedded in a multi - phase interstellar medium . in this sense , we will term all objects with a viral temperature exceeding @xmath32 as a first galaxy ",
    "( see figure  2 ) .",
    "an important consequences of atomic cooling is the softening of the equation of state below the virial radius , allowing a fraction of the potential energy to be converted into kinetic energy ( wise & abel 2007b ) .",
    "perturbations in the gravitational potential can then generate turbulent motions on galactic scales , which are transported to the center of the galaxy . in this context",
    "the distinction between two fundamentally different modes of accretion becomes important .",
    "gas accreted directly from the igm is heated to the virial temperature and comprises the sole channel of inflow until cooling in filaments becomes important .",
    "this mode is termed hot accretion , and dominates in low - mass halos at high redshift .",
    "the formation of the virial shock and the concomitant heating are visible in figure  3 , where we show the hydrogen number density and temperature of the central @xmath33 ( comoving ) around the center of a first galaxy ( greif et al .",
    "this case also reveals a second mode , termed cold accretion .",
    "it becomes important as soon as filaments are massive enough to enable molecule reformation , which allows the gas to cool and flow into the nascent galaxy with high velocities .",
    "these streams create a multitude of unorganized shocks near the center of the galaxy and could trigger the gravitational collapse of individual clumps ( figure  4 ) . in concert with metal enrichment by previous star formation in minihalos , chemical mixing might be highly efficient and could lead to the formation of the first low - mass star clusters ( clark et al .",
    "2008 ) , in extreme cases possibly even to metal - poor globular clusters ( bromm & clarke 2002 ) .",

    "related to the issue of metal enrichment , an important question is what controls the transition from a population of very massive stars to a distribution biased towards low - mass stars . in a seminal paper ,",

    "this study used a time - dependent chemical network running alongside the hydrodynamic evolution as described in glover & jappsen ( 2007 ) .",
    "the physical motivation was to investigate whether minihalos that formed within the relic h  ii regions left by neighboring pop  iii stars could form subsequent generations of stars themselves , or whether the elevated temperatures and fractional ionizations found in these regions suppressed star formation until larger halos formed . in this study , it was found that molecular hydrogen dominated the cooling of the gas for abundances up to at least @xmath45 .",

    "first , the rise in the eos curve between densities @xmath71 and @xmath72 causes material to loiter at this point in the gravitational contraction .",
    "a similar behavior at densities around @xmath73 is discussed by bromm et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "the rotationally stabilized disk - like structure , as seen in the plateau at @xmath74 in figure  7 , is able to accumulate a significant amount of mass in this phase and only slowly increases in density .",
    "second , once the density exceeds @xmath75 , the sudden drop in the eos curve lowers the critical mass for gravitational collapse by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the jeans mass in the gas at this stage is only @xmath76 .",
    "the disk - like structure suddenly becomes highly unstable against gravitational collapse and fragments vigorously on timescales of several hundred years .",
    "a very dense cluster of embedded low - mass protostars builds up , and the protostars grow in mass by accretion from the available gas reservoir .",
    "the number of protostars formed by the end of the simulation is nearly two orders of magnitude larger than the initial number of jeans masses in the cloud setup .    because the evolutionary timescale of the system is extremely short  the free - fall time at a density of @xmath57 is of the order of 10 years ",
    "none of the protostars that have formed by the time that the simulation is stopped have yet commenced hydrogen burning .",
    "this justifies neglecting the effects of protostellar feedback in this study .",
    "heating of the dust due to the significant accretion luminosities of the newly - formed protostars will occur ( krumholz 2006 ) , but is unlikely to be important , as the temperature of the dust at the onset of dust - induced cooling is much higher than in a typical galactic protostellar core ( @xmath77 or more , compared to @xmath78 in the galactic case ) .",
    "the rapid collapse and fragmentation of the gas also leaves no time for dynamo amplification of magnetic fields ( tan & blackman 2004 ) , which in any case are expected to be weak and dynamically unimportant in primordial and very low metallicity gas ( widrow 2002 ) .",
    "however , other authors suggest that the biermann battery effect may amplify weak initial fields such that the magneto - rotational instability can influence the further collapse of the star ( silk & langer 2006 ) .",
    "simulations by xu et al .",
    "( 2008 ) show that this effect yields peak magnetic fields of @xmath79 in the center of star - forming minihalos .",
    "jets and outflows may reduce the final stellar mass by @xmath80 ( machida et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the presence of primordial fields ,",
    "the magnetic pressure may even prevent star formation in minihalos and thus increase the mass scale of star - forming objects ( schleicher et al .",
    "2008a , b ) .",
    "the mass functions of the protostars at the end of the @xmath63 simulations ( both high and low resolution cases ) are shown in figure  7 .",
    "when the simulation is terminated , collapsed cores hold @xmath81 of gas in total .",
    "the mass function peaks somewhere below @xmath82 and ranges from below @xmath83 to about @xmath84 .",
    "this is not the final protostellar mass function .",
    "the continuing accretion of gas by the cluster will alter the mass function , as will mergers between the newly - formed protostars ( which can not be followed using our current sink particle implementation ) .",
    "protostellar feedback in the form of winds , jets and h  ii regions may also play a role in determining the shape of the final stellar mass function .",
    "however , a key point to note is that the chaotic evolution of a bound system such as this cluster ensures that a wide spread of stellar masses will persist",
    ". some stars will enjoy favorable accretion at the expense of others that will be thrown out of the system ( as can be seen in figure  6 ) , thus having their accretion effectively terminated ( see the discussions in bonnell & bate 2006 ; bonnell et al .",
    "the survival of some of the low - mass stars formed in the cluster is therefore inevitable .",
    "the forming cluster represents a very extreme analogue of the clustered star formation that we know dominates in the present - day universe ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "a mere @xmath64 years after the formation of the first object , the cluster has formed @xmath60 stars ( see figure  6 ) . these occupy a region of only around @xmath85 , or @xmath86 , in size , roughly a hundredth of the size of the initial cloud . with @xmath81",
    "accreted at this stage , the stellar density is @xmath87 .",
    "this is about five orders of magnitude greater than the stellar density in the trapezium cluster in orion ( hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) and about a thousand times greater than that in the core of 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud ( massey & hunter 1998 ) .",
    "this means that dynamical encounters will be extremely important during the formation of the first star cluster .",
    "the violent environment causes stars to be thrown out of the denser regions of the cluster , slowing down their accretion .",
    "the stellar mass spectrum thus depends on both the details of the initial fragmentation process ( e.g. as discussed by clark & bonnell 2005 ; jappsen et al .",
    "2005 ) as well as dynamical effects in the growing cluster ( bonnell et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ) .",
    "this is different to present - day star formation , where the situation is less clear - cut and the relative importance of these two processes may vary strongly from region to region ( krumholz et al . 2005 ; bonnell & bate 2006 ; bonnell et al .",
    "2007 ) . in future work",
    ", it will be important to assess the validity of the initial conditions adopted for the present study , ideally by performing cosmological simulations that simultaneously follow the formation of the first galaxies and the metal enrichment by primordial sne in minihalos .",
    "understanding the formation of the first galaxies marks the frontier of high - redshift structure formation .",
    "it is crucial to predict their properties in order to develop the optimal search and survey strategies for the _ jwst_. whereas _ ab - initio _ simulations of the very first stars can be carried out from first principles , and with virtually no free parameters , one faces a much more daunting challenge with the first galaxies .",
    "now , the previous history of star formation has to be considered , leading to enhanced complexity in the assembly of the first galaxies .",
    "one by one , all the complex astrophysical processes that play a role in more recent galaxy formation appear back on the scene . among them",
    "are external radiation fields , comprising uv and x - ray photons , as well as local radiative feedback that may alter the star formation process on small scales .",
    "perhaps the most important issue , though , is metal enrichment in the wake of the first sn explosions , which fundamentally alters the cooling and fragmentation properties of the gas .",
    "together with the onset of turbulence ( wise & abel 2007b ; greif et al .",
    "2008b ) , chemical mixing might be highly efficient and could lead to the formation of the first low - mass stars and stellar clusters ( clark et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in this sense",
    "a crucial question is whether the transition from pop  iii to pop  ii stars is governed by atomic fine - structure or dust cooling .",
    "theoretical work has indicated that molecular hydrogen dominates over metal - line cooling at low densities ( jappsen et al .",
    "2007a , b ) , and that fragment masses below @xmath88 can only be attained via dust cooling at high densities ( omukai et al .",
    "2005 ; clark et al .",
    "on the other hand , observational studies seem to be in favor of the fine - structure based model ( frebel et al .",
    "2007 ) , even though existing samples of extremely metal - poor stars in the milky way are statistically questionable ( christlieb et al . 2002 ; beers & christlieb 2005 ; frebel et al . 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , these studies assume that their abundances are related to primordial star formation  a connection that is still debated ( lucatello et al . 2005 ; ryan et al .",
    "2005 ; komiya et al . 2007 ) . in light of these uncertainties , it is essential to push numerical simulation to ever lower redshifts and include additional physics in the form of radiative feedback , metal dispersal ( greif et al .",
    "2008a ) , chemisty and cooling ( e.g. glover & jappsen 2007 ) and the effects of magnetic fields ( e.g. xu et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we are confident that a great deal of interesting discoveries , both theoretical and observational , await us in the rapidly growing field of early galaxy formation .",
