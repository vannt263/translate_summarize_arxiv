    "we consider the inverse source problem arising in the thermo- and photoacoustic tomography ( tat and pat ) @xcite .",
    "it consists in reconstructing the initial pressure in the acoustic wave from the values of time - dependent pressure measured on a surface , completely or partially surrounding the object of interest @xcite . during the last decade ,",
    "significant results were obtained in solving this problem under the assumption that the wave propagates in free space ( see , for example @xcite and reviews @xcite for additional references ) .",
    "applicability of the free space approximation depends on the type of the device(s ) used to conduct the measurements : it is valid if reflection of waves from the detectors can be neglected .",
    "there are , however , a number of situations where this simple model is not applicable .",
    "for example , when the object is surrounded by glass plates optically scanned to measure the pressure , the waves experience multiple reflections as they would in a resonant cavity @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the assumption indispensable in the analysis of the classical tat and pat about the fast decrease of acoustic energy within the object , can no longer be made .",
    "thus , a novel approach is needed to solve the inverse source problem posed within a resonant cavity .",
    "the latter problem has attracted attention of analysts only recently .",
    "a particular case of a rectangular resonant cavity was considered in @xcite , and several solutions that exploit symmetries of such a geometry were proposed . in @xcite ,",
    "more general acquisition geometries were considered ; one of the main questions investigated in these papers is the applicability of various modifications of the time reversal algorithm to the problem under consideration .",
    "time reversal was successfully used by multiple authors , both theoretically and numerically , to solve the inverse source problem in the free space setting ( @xcite ) . in the latter case",
    ", it consists in solving the wave equation backwards in time , within the domain @xmath0 surrounded by the detectors , using the measured data to pose the dirichlet boundary condition . in the simplest case of constant speed of sound @xmath1 the time reversal",
    "is initialized with zero conditions inside the domain ( at time @xmath2 for sufficiently large @xmath3 .",
    "such approach works due to the fact that the solution of the direct problem in @xmath4 with @xmath5 vanishes within the domain in a finite time @xmath6 , due to the huygens principle ( and so time @xmath7 is chosen to be greater or equal to @xmath8 in 2d and/or when @xmath9 is not constant , more sophisticated methods are used to initialize time reversal @xcite ; however , all these techniques require a time decay of the solution of the direct problem .    the inverse source problem in a cavity with _ partially _ reflecting walls was solved in @xcite using a time reversal approach .",
    "in this case , due to the outflow of energy through the boundary of the domain , solution of the direct problem still exhibits time decay , and , with some modifications , time reversal can still be applied .",
    "a more difficult case is that of _ perfectly _ reflecting boundary ( modeled by zero neumann condition on the boundary ) . in this case , the direct problems is energy preserving , and acoustic oscillations in the cavity continue forever ( here we neglect the effects of attenuation of waves in the tissues ) .",
    "this immediately makes classical time reversal inapplicable : the correct pressure and its time derivative inside the domain are unknown at any time .",
    "the error made when replacing these functions by any crude guess is not small . under the standard dirichlet boundary condition , this error does not decrease as @xmath10 approaches @xmath11 .",
    "several attempts were made to modify the dirichlet boundary condition so as to control this error . in @xcite , the boundary condition",
    "is multiplied by a  smooth cut off function @xmath12 where @xmath13 vanishes at @xmath14 with at least several derivatives .",
    "it was shown that under certain conditions on the eigenvalues of the dirichlet and neumann laplacians on @xmath15 the approximate solutions corresponding to measurement time @xmath7 converge to the correct one in the limit @xmath16 however , for an arbitrary domain the aforementioned conditions on the eigenvalues are difficult to verify . in @xcite ,",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition was modified in such a way that the computed function is the result of averaging of a family of time - reversed solutions with different times @xmath7 ( averaged time reversal ) .",
    "the authors showed that , in the case of full boundary measurements , the operator that describes such a procedure is a contraction .",
    "therefore , the result can be used either as a crude approximation , or a better solution can be computed by a converging neumann series ( involving multiple solutions of the direct problem and averaged time reversals ) . for the case",
    "when the data are available only on a part of the boundary ( i.e. for the partial data problem ) , theoretical analysis was not completed ; however , numerical experiments yielded successful reconstruction in this case , too . in @xcite , the problem with perfectly reflecting walls was considered mostly from a theoretical standpoint , and its unique solvability was proven under sufficiently general conditions .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a new time reversal technique in which the dirichlet boundary condition is replaced by a non - standard boundary condition involving a linear combination of the normal- and time- derivatives of the solution ( see equation ( [ e : rev - p ] ) ) .",
    "while this new condition is satisfied by the solution of the direct problem , the error resulting from the time reversal satisfies the wave equation with dissipative boundary condition , and , thus , it decreases as time @xmath17 approaches @xmath11 .",
    "we call this technique a dissipative time reversal",
    ". this method can be used either directly to obtain good approximations to the initial pressure ( which converges exponentially as @xmath18 ) , or as a part of a neumann series - based iterative algorithm .. in addition to being efficient numerically , our technique is relatively easy to analyze , allowing us to deliver an intuitive proof for the convergences in both full and partial data cases .",

    "we presented a novel dissipative time reversal approach for solving the inverse source problem of tat / pat posed within a cavity with perfectly reflecting walls . unlike the previous work of @xcite where dirichlet boundary condition was used , we utilize the non - standard boundary condition ( [ e : rev - p ] ) .",

    "these two algorithms are applicable for both full and partial data problems .    compared to @xcite , where rather stringent conditions on the eigenvalues of the neumann and dirichlet laplacians on @xmath0 are required for convergence , our approach is based on the much less restrictive gcc ( condition  * [ a : gcc ] * ) . moreover , unlike the method of  @xcite , our technique does not require computing the harmonic extension of the boundary values , which significantly simplifies its numerical realization . it should be noted that the requirement @xmath253 is sharp for the convergence in theorem  [ t : neumann - ser ] ( dealing with the general problem  [ p : tatg ] ) .",

    "specifically , for the case of the full data , it is twice of the sharp time for the convergence of the tat / pat s inverse problem , obtained in  @xcite .",
