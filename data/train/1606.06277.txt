    "<S> the phase competition is tuned by the rare earth ionic radius , decreasing which leads to change from a ferromagnetic metal to a spin disordered highly resistive ground state , and ultimately an ` anderson - mott ' insulator . </S>",

    "<S> we establish a thermal phase diagram that closely corresponds to the experiments , predict the hitherto unexplored orbital correlations , quantify and explain the origin of the anomalous resistivity , and present dynamical properties across the metal - insulator transition .    </S>",
    "<S> traditional mott materials involve a strong on - site coulomb interaction that , beyond a critical value , and at integer filling , inhibits electron motion @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ev , however , our data reveal a weak non monotonicity in the @xmath30 dependence when @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> this arises because @xmath107 gains weight at low frequency , as in panel ( b ) , but _ loses more _ around @xmath108  ev . </S>",

    "<S> the dos has its tight binding form upto @xmath65 beyond which the presence of the orbital moment shows a visible depletion in the dos around @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> this dip becomes a gap for @xmath115 , which grows in the insulating phase . at @xmath116k , fig.[dos].(b ) , the systems with @xmath117 _ lose weight _ near @xmath118 , while those with @xmath119 gain weight . </S>",
