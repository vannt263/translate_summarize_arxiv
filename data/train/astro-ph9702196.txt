    "measurements of anisotropies in the spatial distribution of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) are a powerful probe of the early universe . in the standard inflationary model",
    ", anisotropies were imprinted on the cmb when the universe combined at @xmath6 ( for a review of cosmological theories see , for example , white , scott and silk 1994 ) .",
    "the attenuation of these primordial fluctuations in the cmb by the finite thickness of the surface of last scattering , and photon diffusion , suppress the anisotropy power spectrum at arcminute angular scales .",
    "the exact shape that is predicted for the power spectrum in this regime is strongly dependent on the assumed cosmological model .",
    "additionally , an early period of re - ionization may have only a small effect on the anisotropy power spectrum at degree scales while strongly affecting the magnitude and shape of the power spectrum on arcminute scales .",
    "thus measurements of , or upper limits on , the magnitude of the cmb power spectrum at arcminute scales are a powerful discriminant between competing models .",
    "secondary sources of arcminute - scale anisotropies include the sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) effect  the inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by hot gas residing in the potential wells of galaxy clusters .",
    "measurements at arcminute angular scales can provide important information for theories of large - scale structure formation via number counts of galaxy clusters with a measurable s - z effect .    the sunyaev - zeldovich infrared experiment ( suzie )",
    "is a 6-element bolometer array that has been used to make the first detections of the s - z effect at millimeter wavelengths ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "coupled to the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) , this array has a sensitivity of 0.3jy/@xmath7 at 142ghz in each of six pixel pairs and angular resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "this , and a scan strategy designed to minimize systematic effects , make it an ideal instrument with which to search for arcminute scale anisotropies in the cmb .",
    "this paper describes observations made with the suzie receiver of two regions of sky that are free of known sources .",
    "the data are used to set limits on cmb fluctuations that are assumed to be distributed on the sky with a gaussian autocorrelation function ( gacf ) . a companion paper ( @xcite )",
    "considers the application of these results to specific cosmological models . in this paper",
    "we also consider the limits that these observations place on number counts of s - z clusters .",
    "the suzie bolometer array ( described in detail in @xcite ) is operated at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) on mauna kea . at 142ghz ,",
    "emission from the sky and the warm telescope optics are measured by suzie to contribute 36k in brightness temperature .",
    "a tertiary mirror re - images the cassegrain focus of the telescope to a focal plane comprising two rows of three bolometers cooled to 300mk .",
    "each bolometer is coupled to the primary mirror by a winston concentrator that defines a @xmath1 full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) beam on the sky .",
    "the two rows are separated by @xmath9 , and adjacent pixels within a row by @xmath10 .",
    "the illumination pattern of each winston cone on the primary mirror is controlled by a 2k lyot stop located at an image of the primary produced by the tertiary mirror . to reduce systematic effects from spillover ,",
    "only 8 m of the 10.4 m primary diameter are used .",
    "suzie can be configured for operation at 142 , 217 or 268ghz by placing an appropriate metal - mesh band - pass filter in front of the winston cones .",
    "the observations described here were made at 142ghz with an 11% band - width filter .",
    "the spectral response of the instrument , in its telescope - ready configuration , was measured in the laboratory prior to the observations , including measurements that demonstrate negligible out - of - band leaks .",
    "the measured scatter of the band centers of all six channels about the mean value is less than 1.5% and that of the band - widths is less than 5% .",
    "the optical efficiency of each channel , including the effects of all filters , is measured to be 37% .",
    "electronic differencing between pixels in the same row is carried out to remove common - mode response to atmospheric and telescope emission .",
    "two differences corresponding to 23 on the sky and one to 46 are obtained from each row of the array .",
    "this is accomplished by placing the two bolometers in an ac - biased bridge circuit ( @xcite ) , the output of which is synchronously demodulated to produce a stable dc signal corresponding to the brightness difference on the sky . in terms of atmospheric subtraction , this is equivalent to a square - wave chop on the sky at infinite frequency .",
    "high rejection ( @xmath11 ) of common - mode signals from detector temperature fluctuations and telescope and atmospheric emission ( @xcite ) is achieved by trimming the amplitude of the bias voltage , and thus the responsivity of each detector . to ensure that the pixels that are being differenced are viewing the same column of atmosphere , and thus that maximum rejection of common - mode atmospheric fluctuations is obtained , the tertiary mirror is designed to maximize the overlap of the beams from the six winston cones on the primary mirror without significantly degrading the focus .",
    "the illumination of the primary was measured at 217ghz using a mobile 80@xmath12 load , and was verified to fall to @xmath13db at a radius of 4.0 m from the primary center .",
    "suzie is designed to measure the s - z effect in galaxy clusters . as part of this program ,",
    "regions of sky free of known sources are observed to provide a check for baseline effects that might contaminate the s - z measurements .",
    "we selected two such regions for observation in april 1994 at the positions listed in table  [ t1 ] , using iras catalogs and the nrao 5ghz survey ( @xcite ) to avoid known sources .",
    "each field is near a suzie target cluster , but at least 10 core radii away from the cluster center .",
    "the s - z contribution to each pixel from any residual hot gas at this distance is @xmath14@xmath2k , assuming an x - ray core radius of @xmath15 , a @xmath16-parameter of @xmath17 and , pessimistically , that the cluster gas is described by an isothermal , @xmath18 , model out to many core radii ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "including the effects of differencing pixels in the focal plane will reduce this still further , depending on the angular scale on which the cluster gas is clumped .    in order to minimize systematic errors that might otherwise arise from position - dependent variations in telescope spillover ,",
    "suzie observations are made by fixing the telescope position relative to the earth and allowing the source to drift across the array as the sky rotates .",
    "each scan is two minutes long , yielding a @xmath19 strip of sky , where @xmath20 is the source declination . after each scan",
    "is completed , the dewar is rotated to keep the long axis of the array aligned in the direction of right ascension .",
    "the starting positions of successive scans alternate between @xmath21 and @xmath22 in ra ahead of the location listed in table  [ t1 ] , providing a check for systematic effects that depend on position within a scan rather than on the pointing location of the telescope . because there are two rows of detectors in the focal plane , the complete data set for a single field covers two strips of sky each @xmath23 in ra by @xmath1 in declination , with twice as much observing time allotted to the central two - thirds of each strip as for the outer portions .",
    "the observing scheme is summarized in figure  [ f1n ] . because both sources are close to the celestial equator , @xmath24 and the total area of sky covered is 0.057 square degrees .",
    "seven data sets were obtained , each corresponding to one night of observation on one field ( typically 50 - 100 scans ) .",
    "each data set is first split to separate the scans that correspond to the different ra offsets .",
    "the 6 differential measurements per data set that are obtained by electronically differencing each detector with other detectors in the same row are denoted by pairs @xmath25 where @xmath26 12 , 23 and 31 for the first row and 45 , 56 and 64 for the second row ; the differential signal is the result of subtracting the @xmath27th from the @xmath28th detector voltage .",
    "the data were calibrated using drift - scan observations of uranus for which the expected flux was calculated by convolving the spectral model for the source ( @xcite ) with the instrumental spectral response .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute flux of uranus at 142ghz obtained by this method is @xmath296% .",
    "corrections for atmospheric opacity due to the difference between the elevation of uranus and the elevation of the fields  1 and  2 observations were @xmath30% ( based on data from the cso 225 ghz @xmath31-monitor extrapolated to 142ghz ) .",
    "the result of the calibration is then a signal whose units are flux difference between the two beams .",
    "this is converted to @xmath32 ( the thermodynamic temperature difference between the two beams ) as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and : @xmath35 the temperature of the cmb is taken to be 2.726k ( @xcite ) ; the effect of the 0.01k uncertainty in @xmath36 is negligible compared to other sources of calibration uncertainty .",
    "the solid angle of one pixel , @xmath37 , is calculated from measurements of the beam profile made using jupiter and uranus .",
    "the 2-dimensional shape of the beam was determined from drift scans across jupiter , with the array offset in declination from the source ( transverse to the scan direction ) by steps of @xmath38 .",
    "jupiter is used for this measurement because it is very bright at 142ghz and can thus be used to obtain high signal / noise measurements of the sidelobes and the aspect ratio of the beams",
    ". however , its large size ( @xmath39 ) compared to the suzie beam makes it unsuitable for a direct measurement of the beam solid angle .",
    "this is determined instead from drift scans across uranus , by first assuming a circularly symmetric beam on the sky and integrating the beam profile and then correcting for the measured aspect ratio of the beams .",
    "note that the beams are very nearly circular ( see the jupiter beam map in @xcite ) with an aspect ratio ( defined as fwhm in the scan direction divided by fwhm in the cross - scan direction ) that varies from 0.941.13 .",
    "the uncertainty in the beam shapes , @xmath40 , ( estimated from the scatter of the 6 measured solid angles about their mean value ) contributes a further 5% to the calibration uncertainty .",
    "the total calibration uncertainty is then @xmath41% ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this uncertainty is included in the likelihood analysis of the data carried out in  [ s7 ] .    because each detector contributes to the signal measured by two pairs , the six data streams are not independent . to remove the degeneracy , the two @xmath10 pairs from each row are differenced to generate a double difference :",
    "@xmath43 the data then comprise 4 independent differences , two single differences , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and two double differences , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "cosmic ray impacts on the bolometers cause spikes in the data stream that must be removed .",
    "a point - by - point differentiation is carried out and spikes are identified by a large positive excursion followed by a large negative excursion , or vice versa .",
    "approximately 5% of the data are removed by this process .",
    "the data are then binned by averaging together 15 samples ( 3s of data ) , equivalent to a @xmath48 portion of the drift scan , thus oversampling the @xmath1 beam full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) by a factor of @xmath49 .",
    "a best fit offset and linear drift are removed from each scan prior to co - adding all scans .",
    "the linear drift arises from common - mode variations in signal , primarily from changes in the atmospheric or telescope temperature , that are not completely removed by differencing .",
    "the average values , and variance , of the removed linear drift for each chop are shown in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "the effect of this process on the sensitivity of the system to cmb fluctuations is small , but is taken into account in the analysis in  [ s7 ] .",
    "because the residual noise is dominated by atmospheric emission fluctuations with a @xmath50-type spectrum ( @xcite ) , the statistical error obtained at each point from the binning process is not a good estimate of the sensitivity of the system over longer integration times .",
    "the correlation time of the atmospheric noise can be estimated from the correlation functions of individual scans and is of order 5s ( defined as the time to the first zero in the correlation function ) .",
    "consequently , the binned data points within a single scan are correlated over many bins .",
    "the effects of this correlation on the statistical properties of the data are considered further in ",
    "[ s6.3 ] . in order to assign a sensible weight to each scan ,",
    "the rms scatter , @xmath51 , of the binned data in the @xmath52th scan about the best fit offset and linear gradient is taken to be a representative measure of the noise in that scan .",
    "if the atmospheric noise is normally - distributed within a scan and uncorrelated between scans , this is a good assumption .",
    "note that this process also assumes that the contribution to the rms from true temperature anisotropies within a single scan is negligible .",
    "the implications of these various assumptions are discussed in  [ s6.3 ] .",
    "the scans corresponding to a single ra offset observed on a single night are co - added by combining all of the data at the @xmath53th point in each scan to yield a signal @xmath54 with uncertainty @xmath55 where : @xmath56 here @xmath51 is the rms of the @xmath52th scan after removal of the offset and linear drift , as described above . note that @xmath57 , a constant across the entire co - added scan . figure  [ f2n]a shows the distribution of the @xmath51 values for field  1 taken with the @xmath45 difference .",
    "note that _ all _ of the data are included in the co - add and there is no cutting of data based on high values of scan rms , @xmath51 .",
    "figure  [ f2n]b shows the distribution of the quantity @xmath58 evaluated for a single bin , again using all of the field  1 scans and data corresponding to the @xmath45 difference .",
    "it can be seen that this quantity is normally - distributed with no extreme values or large wings .",
    "this indicates that the quantity @xmath51 is a good estimate of the variance across the entire data set .",
    "co - added data from the two ra offsets are then combined by a weighted average of data points that correspond to the same position on the sky .",
    "finally , a weighted average of the co - added data sets from each night is carried out .",
    "figure  [ f3n ] shows the final co - added data set for field  1 .",
    "the rms uncertainty for each @xmath59 bin is 130220@xmath2k , corresponding to a sensitivity of 35mks@xmath60 for each difference .",
    "both of the single and double difference data sets are shown , with the appropriate beam response to a point source ( measured by drift scans across uranus ) indicated in each panel .",
    "approximately 6 hrs of integration time ( 190 scans ) were obtained on field  1 and 9 hrs ( 277 scans ) on field  2 .",
    "note that double differencing reduces the error bars associated with the @xmath46 data points relative to those of @xmath44 in figure  [ f3n ] , as residual atmospheric gradients are being removed from the data . in the case of @xmath47 and @xmath45 ,",
    "no such improvement is seen , probably due to poor common mode rejection in one of the two pairs that are combined to form @xmath47 .",
    "the data are first examined without prejudice as to the origin of any possible excess signal by performing a series of statistical tests on each data set .",
    "the simplest test that can be performed on the data is a calculation of the value of @xmath61 for each chop and each field , the results of which are shown in table  [ t2b ] .",
    "all chops have values of @xmath61 that lie within the 95% ( @xmath62 ) probability range for 46 degrees of freedom .",
    "however there appears to be a systematic bias towards @xmath61 values less than 46 , indicating that the diagonal correlation assumption is incorrect .",
    "this is the effect of the residual correlation across the co - added data introduced by the presence of atmospheric @xmath50 noise .",
    "the implications of this correlation are considered further is  [ s6.3 ] .",
    "a maximum likelihood analysis ( @xcite ) has been carried out on each data set to determine the most likely amplitude for any excess variance above the noise term described by the uncertainties , @xmath55 . for simplicity , we assume that all points within a single data set are independent , ignoring the correlation between adjacent data points that is introduced by smearing of any true cmb signal by the beams , or by the presence of @xmath50 noise in the data .",
    "each data set is analyzed separately using a maximum likelihood estimator with the likelihood of an excess variance of @xmath63 being : @xmath64^{1/2 } }    \\exp\\left[\\frac{-y^2_i}{2(\\sigma_i^2+\\sigma_e^2)}\\right]\\ ] ] the normalized likelihood as a function of @xmath65 for each difference within each field is shown in figure  [ f4n ] .",
    "there is no data set for which @xmath66 is significantly more likely than @xmath67 , as expected from the @xmath61 analysis . to determine limits on @xmath65 from these curves , we adopt a bayesian approach with a suitable choice of prior . for consistency with experiments that span a similar range of angular scales ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "we adopt a prior that is uniform in @xmath65 .",
    "the 95% ( @xmath68 ) and 99.7% ( @xmath69 ) limits are then calculated using the highest probability density method ( hpd , @xcite ) , in which @xmath70 with the constraint that @xmath71 , yields @xmath72 95 or 99.7% .",
    "the values @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the lower and upper confidence limits respectively",
    ". the 95% and 99.7% confidence limits to @xmath73 are zero for all of the data sets presented here .",
    "the 95% and 99.7% confidence limits for @xmath74 are summarized in table  [ t3 ] .",
    "the position of the likelihood peak is also indicated .",
    "we now examine the validity of the assumption that any excess variance is uncorrelated across the data set .",
    "the autocorrelation function of the data , @xmath75 , defined as : @xmath76 ( where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are defined in equations  [ e1 ] and  [ e2 ] ) with an associated uncertainty , @xmath77 , given by : @xmath78 is shown in figure  [ f5n ] for data from field  2",
    ". significant structure can be seen in some of the differences .",
    "possible non - astronomical sources for this structure are now considered .",
    "the standard suzie observing mode , in which the starting ras of drift scans are alternately 12@xmath79 and 18@xmath79 in ra ahead of the nominal source position ( see figure  [ f1n ] ) , allows checks for systematics that are a function of time within a scan rather than pointing location on the sky . to check for such effects , the cross - correlation of the co - added data corresponding to the 12@xmath79 offset with the co - added data corresponding to the 18@xmath79 offset has been calculated for each chop .",
    "artifacts that occur at the same time after the beginning of a scan will be seen in the cross - correlation function as a peak at zero time - lag .",
    "true astronomical signals in the data will yield a feature in the correlation function at a lag of @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath20 is the source declination .",
    "since both fields are close to the celestial equator @xmath82s .",
    "figure  [ f6n ] shows the cross - correlation of data from the two offsets for data sets corresponding to field  2 .",
    "none of the chops show any strong features at zero lag , indicating that there are no systematic effects in the data that occur at the same time after the beginning of a scan .",
    "peaks in the correlation functions at @xmath83 are seen , but there are no peaks at @xmath84s that would indicate the presence of true astronomical signal ( the peak in @xmath47 is at @xmath85s and is not repeated in any other chop ) .",
    "the most likely cause of these peaks is chance correlation of low - frequency @xmath50 noise which , in this experiment , is dominated by atmospheric emission fluctuations ( see  [ s6.3 ] ) .",
    "the long ( @xmath86s ) coherence time of atmospheric emission fluctuations correlates data at the end of one scan with the data at the start of the next .",
    "the telescope moves by about @xmath87 between scans , corresponding to a change in position of the beams of @xmath88 m at heights @xmath89 km above the telescope .",
    "this is less than the correlation length of atmospheric structure which is @xmath90 m ( assuming a wind speed of 5ms@xmath91 and a measured correlation time of order 5s ) .",
    "co - adding many scans will reduce the magnitude of this correlation but will not eliminate it entirely .",
    "this effect manifests itself in the cross - correlation functions shown in figure  [ f6n ] as non - zero correlations observed at time lags of @xmath92s .      during suzie observations ,",
    "the telescope is stationary during a scan , then re - acquires the source before the next scan begins .",
    "the motion of the telescope between scans results in a small excursion in the temperature of the 300mk stage at the start of a new scan .",
    "the output of the temperature sensor on the 300mk stage , co - added in the same way as the science data , is shown in figure  [ f7n ] .",
    "the amplitude of the temperature excursion at the beginning of the scan is @xmath93nk .",
    "the temperature recovers with a time constant of @xmath94 10  s , and is stable to @xmath94 10  nk rms for the duration of the scan .",
    "although the excursion at the beginning of each scan is very small , we have carried out a number of checks to determine whether this temperature drift causes residual artifacts in the co - added data sets .",
    "first , as described in  [ s6.1 ] , such an artifact would be seen as a peak at zero lag in the cross - correlations of data from the two ra offsets , shown in figure  [ f6n ] .",
    "no significant peak is seen .",
    "second , since the temperature sensor data is sampled at an identical rate to the science data , the measured temperature drift can be correlated with the science channels on a scan - by - scan basis .",
    "the maximum correlated change in signal in the science channels is @xmath95@xmath2k , well below other sources of noise .",
    "this analysis assumes that the shape and the phase of any temperature change in the science channels is identical to that observed in the temperature sensor .",
    "because of differences in the thermal properties of the sensor and the bolometers , this may not be true .",
    "consequently , there could be a large residual effect in the science data that is poorly correlated to the sensor data . as a final check ,",
    "new co - added data sets were generated after excluding the first 21s ( 7 bins ) of data from each scan , and the likelihood analysis in ",
    "[ s5 ] repeated . as shown in figure  [ f8n ] , the sole effect on the calculated likelihood is an increase in the confidence limits caused by the effective reduction in integration time .    from these various tests ,",
    "we conclude that any signal in the data caused by drifts in the temperature of the 300mk stage is much smaller than the experimental uncertainties and can be ignored .",
    "fluctuations in atmospheric emission , caused predominantly by variations in water vapor content , contribute @xmath50 noise to the data with a typical correlation time of 5s , significantly less than the scan length .",
    "we therefore assume that data corresponding to the same coordinates on the sky but separated in time by more than one scan are uncorrelated ( this assumption ignores the correlation of data at the end of one scan with data at the beginning of the next that causes correlations on angular scales of @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the full co - added data sets ; we assume that the effects of atmospheric noise correlated between scans are small ) .",
    "this assumption allows an estimate of the residual contribution to the correlation function of the co - added data .    representing the @xmath53th data point in the @xmath52th scan by the sum of @xmath98 , the true astronomical signal that remains unchanged between scans , and @xmath99 , the noisy signal from all sources for which the coherence time is less than the scan length , the correlation function of the co - added signal is then : @xmath100 here",
    "@xmath101 is the correlation function of the true astronomical signal and @xmath102 is the residual correlation function of the noisy part of the signal .",
    "it can be shown ( appendix  a ) that @xmath102 is given by : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the correlation function of @xmath99 in the @xmath52th scan .",
    "this expression can be rewritten as : @xmath105\\ ] ] where the first term is the correlation function of the atmospheric noise in a single scan averaged over all scans , and the second term is equal to @xmath106 if the uncertainty , @xmath51 , is roughly constant over all scans . since the correlation function of a single scan is given by : @xmath107 it is clearly not possible to calculate @xmath104 independently of the contribution from the true astronomical correlation function . however , if we assume that the atmospheric noise within the individual scans dominates the true astronomical signal in each scan then @xmath108 and the estimated residual correlation function from atmospheric noise , @xmath109 , can then be calculated using equation  [ e10 ] with @xmath110 .",
    "note that @xmath111 is implicit in the assumption made in ",
    "[ s4 ] , equations  [ e1 ] and  [ e2 ] , that the uncertainty , @xmath112 , associated with the data points in an individual scan is equal to @xmath51 , the rms of an entire scan .",
    "how valid is this assumption ?",
    "since the residual atmospheric noise calculated using equation  [ e10 ] is approximately equal to the average correlation function per scan divided by the total number of scans , the contribution of the true astronomical correlation function , @xmath113 , to @xmath109 calculated using equation  [ e10 ] is @xmath114 . since n is typically 100 per ra offset for each field , this contribution is clearly very small compared to @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , if the calculated function , @xmath109 , is compared with the measured correlation function of the co - added data there are several possibilities : ( i ) if @xmath104 and @xmath116 then the contribution of @xmath113 to @xmath117 will be negligible and @xmath109 will be a good fit to the correlation functions shown in figure  [ f5n ] ; ( ii ) if @xmath118 and @xmath119 then the calculated function @xmath109 will be @xmath114 . thus @xmath117 will have the right shape , but will have an amplitude that is too low by approximately two orders of magnitude ; ( iii ) if @xmath120 and @xmath113 have comparable magnitudes then @xmath117 will be a poor fit to the measured correlation functions .",
    "figure  [ f9n ] shows the estimated correlation function of the residual atmospheric noise , @xmath109 , calculated using the methods given above , overlaid on the correlation function of the co - added data corresponding to one ra offset taken from field  1 . at angles less than @xmath121 , the correlation function of the co - added data is moderately well fitted by @xmath109 , corresponding to case  ( i ) above and indicating that the majority of the observed correlation in the data on these scales is due to atmospheric noise or other sources of @xmath50 noise .",
    "there are some large deviations however , particularly in the data from row  2 ( pixels 4 , 5 and 6 ) .",
    "since this row is known to be more susceptible than row  1 to atmospheric fluctuations , these large correlations are likely to be the result of atmospheric drifts that are correlated on time scales longer than one scan ( see  [ s6.1 ] ) .",
    "in order to compare the data to specific models for the power spectrum of cmb fluctuations , the correlation properties introduced by the beam response on the sky , and the overlap on the sky of the single and double differences , must be taken into account .",
    "we represent the correlation function of true temperature anisotropies by : @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are directions on the sky .",
    "if the cmb sky is assumed to be sampled from a gaussian random field then @xmath125 can be written as @xmath126 where the spatial dependence of the function @xmath127 depends only the angular separation , @xmath128 , between the two vectors @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the model correlation function , @xmath129 , of the measured data in the absence of any noise sources is then given by : @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the predicted thermodynamic temperatures of pixels @xmath53 and @xmath133 in the data stream after convolution of the true temperatures with the beam of the instrument .",

    "we need , however , to account for the loss of degrees of freedom introduced by the removal of a mean and linear drift from each scan .",
    "the process , adapted from bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , is summarized here .",
    "the true cmb signal that has been subtracted from the data by the removal of an offset and linear drift can be represented as an unknown amount , @xmath150 , of a set of fitting functions , @xmath151 .",
    "the data vector , @xmath152 , can be corrected for this process by defining a vector @xmath153 such that : @xmath154 the unknown vector @xmath155 has length 8 ( the product of the number of differences and two fitting functions ) ; @xmath151 is a known @xmath156 matrix with elements equal to the value of the fitting functions ( @xmath157 for @xmath158 is the basis function for the offset , and @xmath159 modulo @xmath139 for @xmath160 is the basis function for the slope , where @xmath161 ) .",

    "thus the two data sets are completely uncorrelated both spatially and temporally and the matrix @xmath143 for the complete data set is : @xmath164 the likelihood function for all data from both fields is then : @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are calculated from equation  [ e7.3 ] .",
    "the calibration uncertainty is included at this point in the following manner .",
    "the measured amplitude of the sky correlation function , @xmath168 is assumed to be related to the true value @xmath169 by @xmath170 , where g is gaussian - distributed with width @xmath171 ( the fractional calibration uncertainty ) .",
    "it can then be shown ( @xcite ) that the likelihood of the true amplitude is obtained from the likelihood of the measured amplitude by : @xmath172 l(\\delta t'_0,{\\cal f})\\ ] ]    there remains the issue of the noise term @xmath149 in equation  [ e7.4 ] .",
    "the simplest assumption is that the noise terms are uncorrelated between separate pixels and differences and that @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the uncertainty associated with the @xmath53th data point in difference @xmath28 .",
    "however , as shown in  [ s6.3 ] , there is a significant component of @xmath50 noise in the data that introduces correlations between pixels and also between the different chops . in principle , the non - diagonal noise terms can be estimated using equation  [ e10 ] .",
    "however , this will not account for the residual features in figure  [ f9n ] that are believed to be caused by slow drifts correlated across more than one scan , and that are not well fitted by equation  [ e10 ] .",
    "instead we adopt the following approach . because @xmath109 is such a good fit to the correlation function of the co - added data ,",

    "we consider our measurements in terms of secondary sources of anisotropy from a population of s - z clusters , since these may be comparable to , or larger than , primary anisotropies at these angular scales ( @xcite ) .",
