    "<S> we propose an implementation for quantum logic and computing using trapped atomic spins of two different species , interacting via direct magnetic spin - spin interaction . in this scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the spins ( electronic or nuclear ) of distantly spaced trapped neutral atoms serve as the qubit arrays for quantum information processing and storage , and the controlled interaction between two spins , as required for universal quantum computing , is implemented in a three step process that involves state swapping with a movable auxiliary spin .    </S>",
    "<S> the field of quantum computing has advanced remarkably in the few years since shor @xcite presented his quantum algorithm for efficient prime factorization of very large numbers , potentially providing an exponential speed up over the fastest known classical algorithm . because much of today s crytpography @xcite relies on the presumed difficulty of factoring large numbers , shor s discovery has important implications to data encryption technology and has stimulated much work in the field of quantum information .    motivated by this and other theoretical developments , there is much interest in identifying and realizing experimental systems capable of generating large - scale quantum entanglement . in atomic systems , there have been several recent proposals using trapped ions / atoms and cavity qed systems @xcite . indeed , atomic systems capable of entangling two qubits have already been realized in some of these systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a common element in most of these proposals is that the qubits are stored in distinguishably trapped atoms / ions . </S>",
    "<S> the proposals differ principally in the nature of the atom - atom interaction ( either phonons , photons , collisional , and induced electric - dipole moments ) and in the way that these interactions are controlled .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an implementation of a quantum logic scheme utilizing the direct magnetic spin - spin interaction between individually trapped neutral atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the qubits of this system are stored in the long - lived hyperfine ground states of atoms , and coherent control of the spin - spin interactions is accomplished by controlling inter - atomic spacings . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal is distinctive in that ( 1 ) the magnetic spin - spin interaction used to create the inter - atom entanglement is virtually decoherence - free and ( 2 ) atom - atom interactions are mediated via a movable ` header ' atom which serves to transfer quantum information from one qubit to another ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . the header atom can in fact be a different species , and hence , in contrast to @xcite , the atom trapping potentials are not required to be spin - dependent in order to maintain trap distinguishability for small atom separations and can be realized with far - detuned laser beams . </S>",
    "<S> this latter distinction is important because near - resonant laser traps are a significant source of decoherence .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by considering in detail the inter - atomic potential between two neutral atoms separated by an inter - nuclear distance @xmath0 . for the moment , we assume two spin 1/2 alkali atoms and momentarily neglect the hyperfine interactions . the potential can be written as the sum of three terms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the ( electronic ) spin triplet and singlet potentials , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 represents the long range direct magnetic dipole interaction between two atoms . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the projection operators into the total electronic subspace 1 ( triplet ) and 0 ( singlet ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 represents the exchange interaction , which is typically most important when @xmath7 is less than the leroy radius @xmath8 ( @xmath9 @xmath10 for two identical alkali atoms ) . for two different atom species , </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interaction is considerably suppressed beyond the contact limit ( a few @xmath11 ) . in the long range limit </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are dominated by the van de waals term @xmath12 @xcite .    at low energies </S>",
    "<S> , we can re - express the first two terms of the potential by writing the spin triplet and singlet potentials in terms of the scattering lengths , @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 and explicitly evaluating the projection operators to yield @xmath16 where @xmath17 is electron pauli spin operators @xcite .    at this juncture , </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the recent innsbruck proposal @xcite employs the close - range part of the potential represented in the first line of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ op ] ) in a type of  controlled collision \" . in our scheme </S>",
    "<S> we will use the spin - dependent interaction , i.e. the long range atomic magnetic interaction represented in the last term of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ op ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proposal of brennen , _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite relies on the near - resonant electric dipole interaction ( not present here in the ground state hamiltonian ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to re - express the second term of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ op ] ) by assuming that the two interacting atoms ( denoted by subscripts @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) are harmonically bound in cylindrically symmetric traps with characteristic radial and axial sizes : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath21 and furthermore that the atoms occupy the ground states of their respective traps @xmath23 . in this case , we obtain @xmath24 for a reference harmonic trap frequency @xmath25 with ground state size @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the nuclear coordinates of the atoms with respect to their own trap centers , which are displaced by @xmath29 , and we have defined @xmath30 it s important to recognize that @xmath31 decays exponentially with the nominal atom - atom separation , @xmath32 .    the last term in eq . ( [ op ] ) , @xmath4 , contains three separate terms corresponding to electron - electron , electron - nuclear , and nuclear - nuclear magnetic dipole interactions . between alkali atoms , the strongest is the electron dipole interaction @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the bohr magneton . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of this interaction is @xmath35 while @xmath36 ( electron - nuclear ) and @xmath37 ( nuclear - nuclear ) are about @xmath38 and @xmath39 times smaller respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore one may effectively write the spin - dependent interaction hamiltonian as @xmath40.\\ ] ] typically , we will have @xmath41 for @xmath42 between two identical atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> we will now discuss how this interaction hamiltonian can be used for logic gates . </S>",
    "<S> we first point out that this interaction resembles the quantum gate implementation using the heisenberg spin ( exchange ) interaction @xcite @xmath43 , which is known to be universal . for @xmath44 , </S>",
    "<S> its unitary evolution operator creates a swap gate @xmath45 which in turn can be use to generate xor ( controlled - not ) gates by incorporating single bit operations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , our interaction hamiltonian includes an anisotropic term . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , we can borrow a de - coupling technique developed in nmr @xcite to effect the conversion of @xmath46 , which is also universal . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the phase gate @xcite in terms of these operators is simply @xmath47 from which @xmath48 can be easily made @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the swap gate , which we will require , can be made according to @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes a c - not with @xmath51 as the control bit operating on @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the necessary de - coupling is achieved through a `` stirring '' radio frequency field acting only on the @xmath19-atom@xcite , and is most easily discussed in the context of the following model hamiltonian @xmath53,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the frequency of the stirring field , and @xmath55 is the rabi frequency of the stirring field . by analyzing this system in the rotating frame defined by @xmath56 , we obtain @xcite @xmath57 and invoking a rotating wave approximation , the desired result is obtained , @xmath58\\sigma _ { 1z}\\sigma _ { 2z }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\hbar \\,\\omega _ </S>",
    "<S> { 1}\\sigma _ { 1z}+\\hbar ( \\omega _ { 2}-\\omega _ { s})\\sigma _ { 2z}+\\omega _ { s}(\\sigma _ { 2+}+\\sigma _ { 2-}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although there are unwanted single atom terms in the second line of this hamiltonian , they can be easily compensated with one - bit rotations . for our system , a similar procedure yields the following effective hamiltonian , @xmath59\\sigma _ { qz}\\sigma _ { hz } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & j_{e}(z_{0})\\,\\sigma _ { qz}\\sigma_{hz}.   \\label{e4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] interestingly , we note that the spin and spatial dependence of the operators factorizes . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that coherent spin - spin interactions only require that the motional states of the atoms remain unchanged  the atoms are not necessarily required to be in the ground state @xmath60 of their respective trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> this particular feature of our proposal will be discussed in detail elsewhere . at @xmath61 , </S>",
    "<S> the effective spin - spin interaction strength is @xmath62\\rangle , \\ ] ] which for atoms in the ground states @xmath60 previously described is readily evaluated @xmath63\\rangle    \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi a_{z}^{2}}}}{\\frac{1}{2a_{r}^{4}}}\\int_{-\\infty } ^{\\infty } dz\\exp \\left ( -{\\frac{(z - z_{0})^{2}}{2a_{z}^{2}}}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left [ 2|z|-(a_{r}^{2}+z^{2}){\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi } } { a_{\\rho } } } \\exp \\left ( { % \\frac{z^{2}}{2a_{r}^{2}}}\\right ) { \\rm erfc}\\left ( { \\frac{|z|}{\\sqrt{2}a_{r}}}% \\right ) \\right ] ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where erfc ( . ) is the complementary error function . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the system of two interacting spins are illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the effective interaction is shown in figure [ fig3 ] , we note that @xmath64 is in the khz range for a distance of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 nm ) , which will be more than adequate for gate operations for atoms trapped in far off - resonant optical lattices .    </S>",
    "<S> the principle challenge in implementing this scheme is in providing the appropriate confining potentials for the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , the trapping potentials for the individual atoms need always be distinguishable in order to maintain identifiable qubits . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , as we can see from figure 2 , the atoms need to be in close proximity ( @xmath66 nm ) in order for an appreciable interaction rate even for this ` long - range ' potential . </S>",
    "<S> previous proposals also requiring small inter - atomic spacings have suggested spin - dependent traps created by optical lattices with polarization gradients @xcite . because of the nature of these types of traps , the types of atomic manipulations are rather restricted , and hence scalability is difficult .    to circumvent this complication , we will use two different atomic species , one for the ( stationary ) quantum register , and one for the quantum header atom . </S>",
    "<S> each species of atom will be separately trapped by different laser fields . by appropriate choice of atom and frequency of the trapping fields </S>",
    "<S> , we can make these traps essentially independent . for a concrete example , consider a quantum register consisting of an array of single atoms ( type @xmath18 for qubit ) trapped in 3d standing wave formed by interfering laser field of a co@xmath67 lasers ( wavelength @xmath68 @xmath69 m ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the qubits will be separated by @xmath70 which is more than enough to allow individual addressing , and at this separation , the long range casimir - polder interaction is negligible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the trapping details are discussed in the appendix , but we point out that the potential @xmath71 is very well approximated by the dc - polarizability of the atom @xmath72and the laser electric field amplitude @xmath73 as @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant parameters are tabulated for alkali atoms in table [ table1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> a separate laser field provides confinement for the header atom ( of a different type atom , @xmath19 ) . by choosing a trapping wavelength somewhat closer to the atomic resonance of @xmath19 ( and detuned to the blue of the resonance ) , we can provide a potential which acts principally on the @xmath19 atom . </S>",
    "<S> the potential depth for this trap is given by @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the rabi frequency of the laser , and @xmath77 the detuning . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19 atom is also affected by the far off - resonant co@xmath67 laser field of course , but we can arrange for the off - resonant blue detuned field to dominate the far off - resonant co@xmath67 laser potential by suitable choice of atoms . trapping parameters for this case </S>",
    "<S> are listed in table [ table2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum register atoms ( type @xmath78 will also be affected , at some level , by the blue lattice , but the detuning between the blue field and the @xmath18 atoms will be much larger , so the potential will be dominated by the co@xmath67 laser field for the @xmath18 atoms .    gate operations in this system can be achieved in a three step process requiring quantum state swapping between the quantum bits and the header atom . to execute a gate operation between two qubits @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we first translate the header atom @xmath19 to the location of @xmath79 and perform a state swap @xmath81 the header atom is then translated to site @xmath80 and the gate operation between @xmath82 and @xmath83 is performed . finally the header atom is translated back to @xmath79 to and the state swap is repeated . </S>",
    "<S> the header atom effectively acts as an quantum bus between the qubits , and in this sense our scheme shares certain features with the quantum gear machine proposed by divincenzo @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> single - bit operations can be realized either by directly addressing the individual qubits @xmath79 , or , alternatively , we can use the header atom as a mediator . </S>",
    "<S> the latter option may be easier in some cases than the direct spatial selection of @xmath79 because the @xmath19 atoms can be sparsely distributed and have different resonance level structures . </S>",
    "<S> the single bit operation will again be a three step process : 1 ) perform a state swap between @xmath79 and @xmath19 , 2 ) perform the arbitrary qubit operation on @xmath19 , 3 ) repeat the state swap between @xmath19 and @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> in considering the ultimate scalability of this , and other lattice - based schemes , it is necessary to compare the characteristic intrinsic decoherence time of the system to the gate time _ plus _ the transport time of the moving atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the transport of the moving atoms ( the h - type atom in this case ) must be adiabatic such the motional state of the atom remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this latter condition implies constraints on the magnitude of the motion , which we can estimate using perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> consider the hamiltonian for a one dimenstional harmonically trapped particle with mass @xmath84 and trap frequency @xmath85 subjected to a force @xmath86 , @xmath87 adiabaticity condition for the header qubit translation requires its motional state wave - function to be essentially unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is equivalent to the problem of a translating sho potential @xmath88 ^ 2/2 $ ] [ with @xmath89 up to a deterministic phase factor due to @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> calculating the probability for excitation out of the ground state is a standard textbook problem and the result to first order is @xmath91 for a time dependent force @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath93 is the energy gained from the impulse @xmath94 of the force . </S>",
    "<S> we see that adiabaticity is maintained even after the translating atom gains a very large speed , but satisfying the condition @xmath95 , i.e. a force to be slowly turning on and off compared with the harmonic trap period . </S>",
    "<S> similar conclusions are reached for an initial coherent motional state wave - packet . </S>",
    "<S> this condition effectively then puts no constraint on the header atom speed , contrary to the strong conditions as obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for our problem , creative pulse shape design will allow the header atom to be adiabatically transported over many qubits within the single photon scattering coherence time .    </S>",
    "<S> our discussion thus far has been limited to alkali atoms with no nuclear spin ( e.g. @xmath96rb ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the nuclear spin @xmath97 is nonzero , the atomic spin takes on values @xmath98 and we must include the hyperfine interaction @xmath99 . the spin - spin interaction becomes considerably richer in detail . </S>",
    "<S> however , if a strong zeeman interaction is applied using a uniform magnetic field , the resulting two manifolds of zeeman states correspond roughly to the electronic spin up / down such that the good basis becomes latexmath:[$%    atom with no nuclear spin such as @xmath96rb ( radioactive lifetime about 20 minutes ) .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed a new quantum computing implementation with trapped atomic spins . </S>",
    "<S> utilizing dual optical lattices for two different type of atoms provides a novel method to control the binary interaction between any pair of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our proposal , being based on the periodic structure of optical lattices , is readily scalable , and in particular , redundant parallel processing of information can be implemented using multiple @xmath19-type atoms operating on repetitive blocks of @xmath18-type atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this may be useful in implementing error correction @xcite , concatenated coding , and fault tolerant computing @xcite .    </S>",
