    "with the understanding of the important role of flavor in leptogenesis @xcite , it has become progressively clear that the link between low - energy _",
    "cp _ violation and",
    "the size of the baryon asymmetry predicted by thermal leptogenesis @xcite is considerably tighter than in the unflavored ( or one - flavor ) situation .",
    "in particular it was shown in @xcite for a hierarchical rh neutrino spectrum that a non - zero majorana phase can be the unique source of _ cp _ violation contributing to the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe , although the allowed region in the parameter space was small , and mainly in the weak wash - out .",
    "the dirac phase can also do the job , provided the angle @xmath2 is not too small @xcite .    within the see - saw model @xcite , a nice way to see the different contributions to",
    "the _ cp _ violation required for leptogenesis is to choose the following parametrization of the dirac mass matrix @xcite : m_d = u  , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the light and heavy neutrino masses , respectively , and @xmath5 . among the 18 supplementary parameters brought by the see - saw",
    ", 6 are _ cp _ violating phases : 1 dirac and 2 majorana phases in the pmns mixing matrix @xmath6 , as well as 3 unobservable phases in the @xmath7 matrix .",
    "the @xmath7 matrix can be conveniently parametrized as a product of three complex rotations , @xmath8 .    in @xcite we analysed in detail the role of the dirac phase as the _ unique _ source of _ cp _ violation required for leptogenesis .",
    "the aim is here to summarize some important results obtained there .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in the hierarchical limit ( hl ) , @xmath9 , one can safely study only the decay of the lightest rh neutrino , @xmath10 , and we anticipate that successful leptogenesis will occur for , where a two - flavor regime applies , with flavors denoted @xmath11 .    since here we consider leptogenesis exclusively from one low - energy phase , namely the dirac phase , we have that the total _",
    "asymmetry @xmath12 , so that the final asymmetry can be written as n_b - l^f(_1^f-_1,e+^f)_1 , where @xmath13 are the final efficiency factors , which include the effects of the wash - out and the production of the asymmetry .",
    "since the _ cp _ asymmetry parameter @xmath14 , if one requires the final asymmetry , including the sphaleron conversion , to match the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , @xmath15 @xcite , one obtains a lower bound on the lightest rh neutrino mass , @xmath16 .",
    "we show in fig . 1 an example of",
    "lower bound @xmath17 vs. @xmath18 for the particular choice @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . when the condition of validity for the fully flavored boltzmann equations is used ( see @xcite for a discussion ) , the region allowed is only outside the squared region . in the dashed region",
    "it is not exluded but one expects some modification of the results shown .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "1 that the allowed region is very marginal , and only in the weak wash - out regime , where there is a dependence on the initial conditions .",
    "moreover , in the example shown , we took the angle @xmath2 at its maximal allowed value , so if the upper bound on @xmath2 becomes one order of magnitude more stringent in the future , it will essentially exclude dirac phase leptogenesis in the hierarchical limit .",
    "one way - out of this unfavorable situation is to go to a quasi - degenerate rh neutrino spectrum , where the _ cp _ asymmetry can be enhanced and where a strong wash - out is ensured .",
    "in the degenerate limit ( dl ) , @xmath23 , we anticipate the mass @xmath16 to be below @xmath24 , so that a three - flavor problem arises , with flavors @xmath25 .",
    "contrary to the hl , the _ cp _ asymmetries , as well as the wash - outs , must be now summed over each rh neutrino : n_b - l^f_(_1+_2+_3)_^f ( k_1+k_2+k_3 ) . in the dl , the _ cp",
    "_ asymmetries are inversely proportional to the degeneracy parameter @xmath26 .",
    "this implies a dependence on @xmath27 of the lower bound on @xmath16 for successful leptogenesis . for @xmath19",
    "we obtained the following @xmath28 bounds for normal and inverted hierarchy , respectively : m_15.510 ^ 9 gev _",
    "31|_13| m_1510 ^ 11 gev _",
    "it is interesting to notice how the degeneracy parameter is linked to the size of @xmath0 for successful leptogenesis at fixed @xmath16 .",
    "the enhancement for close rh neutrino masses is of course limited . indeed , when @xmath29 , one hits a resonance @xcite , where @xmath30 accounts for the present uncertainty in the location of the resonance .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in this extreme situation we obtained a lower bound on @xmath2 which depends on the lightest active neutrino mass , @xmath1 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "2 , for @xmath19 and a normal hierarchy . the corresponding constraint for an inverted hierarchy as well as for other @xmath7 matrices can be found in @xcite .",
    "note finally that for a vanishing @xmath1 , successful dirac phase leptogenesis demands @xmath31 and @xmath32 for normal and inverted hierarchy , respectively .",
    "the possibility that the dirac phase , which one hopes to measure in the next - generation neutrino experiments , might be the source of _ cp _ violation required for leptogenesis is interesting .",
    "we obtained that a degenerate rh neutrino spectrum is preferred and that in the extreme case of resonant leptogenesis a nice link between low - energy parameters , such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the mass hierarchy , is present .",
