    ", the parameters must be derived indirectly , for instance from the balmer and other nebular emission lines . especially for planetary nebulae ( pne )",
    "there exist some simple approximations to derive the effective temperature , distance or elemental abundances . but",
    "these approximations are normally based on the assumption of a constant density spherically symmetric nebula .",
    "although the theory of interacting stellar winds that shape the nebulae and lead to a density distribution rather than to a constant density , which has first been proposed by kwok et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , is nowadays accepted and well established , people still use the assumption of a constant density nebula to derive stellar and circumstellar parameters ( see e.g. costa et al . 1993 ; ali 1999 ; phillips 2003 ; gruenwald & viegas 2000 ; villaver et al .",

    "to determine the stellar and nebular parameters for the galactic compact planetary nebula hen 2 - 90 we make use of a set of optical observations specified in table[line_param ] .",
    "these data have been corrected for an interstellar extinction of @xmath6 derived from the balmer line ratio for @xmath7k .",
    "we concentrate on two specific models : the constant density nebula model ( cdnm ) and a density distribution model ( ddm ) .",
    "both models have the following assumptions in common :    * spherically symmetric fully ionized shell or nebula , * constant electron temperature fixed at @xmath8k , * all lines in table[line_param ] are optically thin , and * hydrogen follows case b recombination .",
    "in addition , for cdnm we use a constant electron density throughout the nebula while for ddm we assume a density distribution of the form @xmath9 @xmath1 is the electron density at the inner edge , @xmath10 , of the emission shell and is kept as a free parameter . such a density distribution has been found from hydrodynamic models to be valid over large regions within the wind interaction zone ( see e.g. steffen & schnberner , 2003 ) .",
    "the effective temperature of the central star of a pn is usually derived using the zanstra method for hydrogen ( see e.g. osterbrock 1989 ; pottasch 1984 ) which results in @xmath11 the left hand side is the continuum luminosity ( e.g. at the wavelength of h@xmath3 ) over the total number of ionizing photons .",
    "this is a pure function of the stellar continuum flux , i.e. a function of effective temperature and surface gravity .",
    "the right hand side contains the ( reddening independent ) fraction of observed fluxes times a function @xmath12 which is a constant in case of cdnm but a function of electron density distribution in case of ddm because the @xmath13 values that describe the deviation from lte of the balmer line level populations are for high electron densities no longer constant ( left panel of fig.[bn ] ) .",
    "the right panel of fig.[bn ] shows @xmath12 for different values of @xmath14 ranging from @xmath15@xmath16 ( top ) to @xmath17@xmath16 ( bottom ) as a function of @xmath18 .",

    "while cdnm gives values in the range of @xmath24 , the range found for ddm is shifted to lower values covering the range @xmath25 ; the lowest temperature is for the lowest ( choosen ) @xmath1 value of @xmath15@xmath16 .",

    "we need to know the constant electron density .",
    "this can be found from the sulfur line ratio ( left panel of fig.[lineratio ] ) and turns out to be @xmath28@xmath16 .",

    "the observed sulfur line ratio defines the lower limit of @xmath1 ( right panel of fig.[lineratio ] ) which is about @xmath30@xmath16 .",
    "models with @xmath31@xmath16 can not reproduce the observed line ratio of 2.25 .",

    "we find that the effective temperature of the central star derived with ddm is slightly ( but not significantly ) lower than with cdnm , classifying the star as spectral type o. the most interesting result is , however , that the s@xmath2 abundance found with ddm is definitely larger than the value found with cdnm . even though we neglected additional ionization stages , this result might hold for all abundances derived from forbidden lines and might solve the problem of the underabundances sometimes found in pne .",
