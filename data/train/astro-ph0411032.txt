    "the suspected progenitor of v838 mon was identified by munari et al .",

    "possibly v838 mon might have a b3v companion ( desidera & munari 2002 ) , but it could be a background star . the discovery of a light echo ( henden et al .",

    "since the middle of 2002 march , the emissions are considerably weakened and the spectrum of v838 mon evolved to later spectral classes . in middle of 2002 april , there were present some lines of tio ; in may the spectrum evolved to the``very cold '' m - giant ( banerjee & ashok 2002 ) . in october evans",

    "these we obtained from an analysis of absorption spectra of v838 mon on 2002 february 25 and march 2 and 26 .",
    "the complexity and uniqueness of the observed characteristics of v838 mon practically excluded a definition of the parameters of the atmosphere using conventional methods , based on calibration on photometric indices , ionization balance , profiles of hydrogen lines .",

    "emission in the hydrogen lines provides severe problems for their application in the estimation of effective temperature .",
    "moreover , both the macroturbulent motions and expansion of the pseudophotosphere merges the numerous lines in wide blends . as a result",
    ", a single unblended line in the spectrum of v838 mon can not be found at all , and any analysis based on measurements of equivalent widths is completely excluded .    the observational data used in this paper are described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 explains some background to our work and some details of the procedure used .",

    "to carry out our analysis of v838 mon we used the spectral synthesis techniques .",
    "our synthetic spectra were computed in the framework of the classical approach : lte , plane - parallel media , no sinks and sources of energy inside the atmosphere , and transfer of energy provided by the radiation field and by convection .    strictly speaking",
    ", none of these assumptions is 100% valid in atmosphere of v838 mon .",
    "clearly we have non - static atmosphere which may well have shock waves moving trough it .",
    "still we assumed that in any moment the structure of model atmosphere of v838 mon is similar to model atmospheres of supergiants .",
    "indeed , temporal changes of the absorption spectra on the days were rather marginal .",
    "most probably , for this object , we see only a pseudophotosphere , which is the outermost part of an expanding envelope .",
    "therefore , our first goal was to determine whether it is possible to fit our synthetic spectra to the observed v838 mon spectra .    at the time of the observations the spectral class of v838 mon was determined as k - type ( kolev et al .",
    "absorption lines in spectrum of v838 mon form comparatively broad blends .    generally speaking , there may be a number of broadening mechanisms :    * microturbulence , which is formed by small scale ( i.e @xmath13 ) motions in the atmosphere . in the case of a supergiant ,",

    "can not contribute much to the broadening of lines observed in spectra of most supergiants .",

    "asymmetrical profiles of expansion broadening can be described , to a first approximation , by the formula + @xmath15 where @xmath16  is the expansion velocity .",

    "they differ drastically  the spectrum of february 3 is severely veiled by emission : many lines are observed in emission .",
    "this demonstrates that effects of the radial expansion of the line - forming layers were not significant for the dates of our data and formally obtained value @xmath16  = 160 km s@xmath4 is not real .",

    "our v838 mon spectra for february 25 , march 2 and 26 agree , at least qualitatively , with the spectrum of arcturus ( k2 iii ) , convolved with macroturbulent velocity profile , given by a gaussian of half - width @xmath17  = 50 km s@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ _ _ arctur ] ) .",

    "unfortunately we can not , from the observed spectra , distinguish between broadening due to the macroturbulence and expansion ( see next section ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the observed spectra of v838 mon are formed in a medium with decreasing temperature to the outside , i.e. in the local co - moving system of co - ordinates the atmosphere , to a first approximation , can be described by a `` normal '' model , at least in the region of formation of weak or intermediate strength atomic lines .",
    "we computed a sample of lte synthetic spectra for a grid of kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres with t@xmath0  = 4000  6000 k using the wita612 program ( pavlenko 1997 ) .",

    "then , due to the high luminosity of the star , we formally adopt log g = 0 .",
    "synthetic spectra were computed using the vald ( kupka et al .",
    "1999 ) line list . for atomic lines",
    "the line broadening constants were taken from vald or computed following unsold ( 1955 ) .",

    "@xmath26 may be wavelength dependent . to get the best fit we find the minima per point of the 2d function    @xmath27 .",
    "we calculated these minimization parameters for our grid of synthetic spectra to determine a set of parameters @xmath28 ( wavelength shift parameter ) and @xmath29 ( convolution parameter ) .",
    "the theoretical spectra were convolved with a gaussian profile .",
    "our convolution profile is formed by both expansion and macroturbulent motions .",
    "we can not distinguish between them in our spectra . to get a numerical estimate of the broadening processes in the pseudophotosphere",
    ", we use a formal parameter @xmath30  , which describes the cumulative effect of broadening / expansion motions .",
    "the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 were determined by the minimization procedure ; the procedure was carried out for different spectral regions .",
    "we selected for analysis 6 spectral orders in the interval 5600 - 6700 .",
    "in the red , spectral lines are blended by telluric spectra , and are of lower s / n .",
    "in the blue the blending of the spectra are rather high .",
    "our main intention was to obtain a self - consistent solution separately for different echelle orders , and then compare them . if we could obtain similar parameters from different spectral regions it can be evidence of the reality of the obtained solution .",
    "to be confident in our procedure , we carried out a similar analysis for the sun .",
    "for this case we know the solar abundances and other basic parameters , therefore our analysis provides an independent estimation of the quality of our procedure :    * from the solar atlas of kurucz et al ( 1984 ) we extract spectral regions corresponding to our observed orders of v838 mon ; * we convolve the solar spectra with a gaussian of @xmath17  = 50 km s@xmath4 .",
    "* we carried out a spectral analysis of the spectral regions with our procedure ; again , model atmospheres from kurucz ( 1993 ) with a grid of different @xmath20 , t@xmath0  , @xmath2 were used .",

    "from a comparison of our results for all three dates we see that :    * the effective temperature for march 26 is somewhat lower then for the previous dates .",
    "this is an expected result , in view of the gradual cooling of envelope .",
    "however , for march 2 we found a slightly higher value of temperature than for february 25 .",
    "a possible explanation is the heating of the pseudophotosphere as result of the third outburst . *",
    "the microturbulent velocities are very similar and extremely high for all three dates . *",
    "our analysis shows a lower value of @xmath30  for the later dates : the effects of expansion and macroturbulence were weakened at the later stages of evolution of the pseudophotosphere of v838 mon . * the iron abundances @xmath2 = -4.7 @xmath32 are similar for all dates .",

    "those in kipper et al ( 2004 ) do not correspond with values obtained from photometry ( t@xmath0  @xmath12 4200 k ) .",
    "we assume that in our analysis we deal with temperatures in the line forming region , rather than with the temperatures at photospheric levels which determine the spectral energy distribution of v838 mon and the photometric indices .",
    "indeed , the formally determined microturbulent velocity @xmath9  = 13 km s@xmath4 exceeds the sound velocity in the atmosphere ( 4 - 5 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "this means that the region of formation of atomic lines should be heated by dissipation of supersonic motions : the temperature there should be higher than that given in a plane - parallel atmosphere of t@xmath0  @xmath12 4200 k.    certainly the effect can not be explained by sphericity effects : the temperature gradients in the extended atmospheres should be steeper ( see mihalas 1978 ) , therefore temperatures in the line forming regions should be even lower , in contradiction with our results .",
    "strong deviations from lte are known to occur during the photospheric stages of the evolution of novae and supernovae .",
    "the main effect there should be caused by deviations from lte in the ionization balance .",
    "however , in our case we used lines of the neutral iron , which dominate by number .",
    "we can not expect a reduction in the density of fe i atoms in the comparatively cool atmosphere of the star .",
    "furthermore , we exclude from our analysis strong lines with p cyg profiles .",
    "lines of interest in our study have normal profiles .",
    "in our work we used model atmospheres computed by kurucz ( 1993 ) for the comparative low value of @xmath9  = 2 km s@xmath4 .",
    "our estimates of @xmath9  in the atmosphere of v838 mon are much higher . in general",
    ", the temperature structures of the model atmospheres of late spectral classes respond to changes in @xmath9  . nonetheless , in our case , the results depend mainly on temperatures in the line - forming region",
    ". we can use `` standard model atmospheres '' only in the first approach computations .",
    "the dependence of our results on @xmath9  should be of second order of importance .    to check this",
    "we computed the grid of models with @xmath9  = 2 and 15 km s@xmath4 for t@xmath0  = 4750 - 5750 k with step 250 k and log g = 1 .",
    "unfortunately we were not able compute models with log g = 0 in case @xmath9  = 15 km s@xmath4 .",
    "a program sam12 ( pavlenko 2003 ) was used .",
    "line opacity treatment was used to account absorbtion of atomic and ion lines .",
    "then we carry out our fiting procedure for this grid of models for february 25 data .",
    "we found that differences in results less then 0.1 dex in iron abudance and 1 km s@xmath4 in @xmath9  .",
    "still this `` @xmath9  factor '' must be considered in detail in future work based on the more sophisticated models .    in the present work we determined only the iron abundance .",
    "the effects of other element abundances should be taken into account as well . however , the obtained effective temperatures of v838 mon are rather low and lines of neutral iron are of prime importance .",
    "changes in the abundances of other free electrons donors  sodium , potassium , etc .",
    " can not affect the ionization equilibrium of iron .",
    "however , we suggest continued attempts to determine their abundances .",
    "in addition to their direct importance to the determination of the evolutionary status of v838 mon , they are also of importance for the determination of the opacities in the stellar atmosphere . generally , to determine the abundances of a few elements from modelling of complex blends we need to know a ) the number and b ) relative intensities of contributing lines , i.e the abundances of all elements .",
    "we have carried out our study in the framework of a comparatively simple model .",
    "the static lte model for the star with expanding pseudophotosphere is the rough enough approximation .",
    "most of our results are rather qualitative , and they should be confirmed and/or refined in the future .",
    "however , in general we are confident enough in our results , in particular :    * we obtain some evidence of cooling of the line - forming region ; * most probably , the line - forming region is heated by supersonic motions  our spectroscopic temperatures exceed photometrically determined t@xmath0  by @xmath12 1000 k ; * we do not find any significant change in the iron abundance in atmosphere v838 from february 25 to march 26 .",
