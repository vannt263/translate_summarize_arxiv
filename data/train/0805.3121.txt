    "since the discovery of the large thermoelectric power  @xcite and then of superconductivity  @xcite in the @xmath10 layered cobaltate family , these systems have attracted a lot of attention .",
    "indeed , they present a very rich phases diagram , as a function of the sodium content @xmath6 , and the possible water intercalation . for small @xmath6 ( @xmath11 )",
    "the magnetic susceptibility does not depend on temperature .",
    "these systems are thus supposed to be paramagnetic metals , however some authors reinterpreted the data ( using nmr measurements  @xcite ) and conclude that these systems should be antiferromagnetic metals . for larger @xmath6 ( @xmath12 )",
    "the compounds are curie - weiss metals . over @xmath13 ,",
    "the system has be seen as a weakly ferromagnetic metal  @xcite , however neutron diffraction measurements  @xcite rather sees a - type antiferromagnetism , that is ferromagnetic @xmath9 layers , antiferromagnetically coupled . for special values of the sodium content , @xmath14  @xcite , @xmath15  @xcite and @xmath16  @xcite , the system is insulating . a band insulator for @xmath16 and a charge / spin",
    "ordered state for @xmath17 . on the contrary , for @xmath18",
    "the system remains conducting  @xcite , exhibiting a fermi liquid behavior , while its half - filling character associated with the large electron correlation of the cobalt @xmath5 let expect a mott insulator .",
    "the @xmath10 compounds are composed of @xmath19 layers in the @xmath20 plane , between which the sodium ions are located .",
    "the @xmath19 layers are formed by @xmath21 edge - sharing octahedra forming a two - dimensional triangular lattice of cobalt ions .",
    "the @xmath21 octahedra present a trigonal distortion along the crystallographic @xmath22 axis corresponding to a compression of the oxygen planes toward the cobalt one .",
    "additional distortions take place , according to the sodium ordering .    in the pure @xmath19 compound , although tarrascon _",
    "@xcite suggested a complex crystallographic structure , further authors refined the structure with a single cobalt crystallographic position  @xcite .",
    "this system exhibits a geometry quite characteristic compared to the rest of the @xmath23 family .",
    "first , the inter - layer distance is very short .",
    "indeed , the inter - layer distance is 4.48  , 4.31  or 4.25  according to the authors , while for @xmath24 it ranges from 5.2  to 5.7  and increases with decreasing @xmath6 .",
    "second , the @xmath9 layer is very compressed in the @xmath22 direction . indeed ,",
    "its thickness is only 1.71 while it ranges between 1.92  and 1.98  for the @xmath10 family .",
    "in fact , in this system , the @xmath9 layer is even more compressed than in the superconducting , hydrated compound , for which its thickness is 1.76 .",
    "it results in a very large trigonal distortion of the @xmath21 octahedra , with 62.3 degrees between the @xmath22 axis and the co  o directions .",
    "using the results of reference  , this strong trigonal distortion lets us expect a strong @xmath2@xmath3 splitting .",
    "third , the co  o distances are shorter than in all the other compounds of the family , with only 1.847 .",
    "@xmath25 +    @xmath26 +    in the @xmath27 compound ( p2 structure , subject of the present work ) , the sodiums ordering is commensurate and presents two types of alternated stripes along the @xmath28 direction  @xcite . in the first stripes ,",
    "the sodium atoms are located on - top of ( below ) the cobalts atoms , and in the second type of stripes the sodium ions are located on - top of ( below ) the center of the cobalt triangles ( see figure  [ f : struct ] ) .",
    "it results two types of cobalt atoms organized in stripes along the @xmath28 direction , namely the co(1 ) atoms ( located on top of a sodium ion ) and the co(2 ) ones .",
    "compared to the other systems of the family , the @xmath27 compound does not stick out  @xcite .",
    "indeed , its @xmath9 layers present a thickness of 1.97  .",
    "the average co  o distances are 1.887for co(1 ) and 1.900  for co(2 ) .",
    "the average trigonal distortions are associated with angles of 58.9 degrees ( between the @xmath22 axis and the co(1)o directions ) , and 59.4 degrees ( co(2)o ) .",
    "these angles are weaker than for the superconducting system or the pure @xmath9 one , but still quite larger than the 54.7 degrees of the regular octahedron .",
    "one can thus expect a splitting of the @xmath29 cobalt @xmath5 orbitals in two quasi - degenerate @xmath3-type orbitals of low energy and a @xmath2-type one at the fermi level .",
    "out of all the @xmath30 systems , the @xmath17 compound presents a very rich but not well understood phases diagram .",
    "indeed , the @xmath31 ions order at very large temperature , namely slightly above 300  k  @xcite , inducing a small charge order in the cobalt layer . despite this small charge order",
    "the system remains conducting . at 88  k",
    "a magnetic phase transition occurs , associated with a structural distortion , and the onset of a long range magnetic order . again , despite this transition , the system remains conducting up to 53  k where a small charge gap ( 14 mev ) finally opens  @xcite .",
    "the understanding of this complex phase diagram is still under process .",
    "different hypotheses have been advanced such as successive fermi surface nesting  @xcite , polarons formation  @xcite , one band versus three bands cross - over  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the @xmath9 compound remains conducting for all temperatures , opposite to the mott insulator behavior that was expected due to its half - filled character .",
    "the low temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility lead some authors to suggest that this compound is a weakly correlated metal  @xcite .",
    "however , as for the other compounds with @xmath32 , these data were reinterpreted  @xcite in view of nmr measurements as due to strong antiferromagnetic coupling .    in order to understand the low energy physics of these systems",
    "it is thus necessary to have accurate determinations of the pertinent degrees of freedom and of their coupling , as a function of the exact crystallographic structure .",
    "indeed , all authors agree on the importance of the sodium ordering and the induced cobalt local environment distortions , on the low energy properties .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide such informations using state of the art quantum chemical spectroscopy methods for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 compounds .",
    "the next section will shortly recall the methods .",
    "section iii will presents our results and finally the last section will sum up our conclusions .",
    "the method used in this work ( cas+ddci  @xcite ) is a configurations interaction method , that is an exact diagonalization method within a selected set of slater determinants , on embedded crystal fragments .",
    "this method has been specifically designed to accurately treat strongly correlated systems , for which there is no single - determinant description .",
    "the main point is to treat exactly all correlation effects and exchange effects within a selected set of orbitals ( here the @xmath5 shell of the cobalt atoms ) as well as the excitations responsible for the screening effects on the exchange , repulsion , hopping , etc",
    ". integrals .",
    "the cas+ddci method has proved very efficient to compute , within experimental accuracy , the local interactions ( orbital energies , atomic excitations , exchange and transfer integrals , coulomb repulsion etc . ) of a large family of strongly correlated systems such as high @xmath33 copper oxides  @xcite , vanadium oxides  @xcite , nickel and cuprate fluorides  @xcite , spin chains and ladders  @xcite , etc .",
    "the clusters used in this work involve one and two cobalt atoms ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) and their oxygen first coordination shell ( see figure  [ f : clus ] ) .",
    "these fragments are embedded in a bath designed so that to reproduce on them the main effects of the rest of the crystal  ; that is the madelung potential and the exclusion effects of the electrons of the other atoms of the crystal on the clusters electrons .",
    "the electrostatic potential is reproduced by a set of point charges located at the atomic positions .",
    "the charges are renormalized next to the bath borders , using the gell s method , in order to obtain an exponential convergence of the madelung potential  @xcite .",
    "the convergence accuracy was set in the present work to the mili - electron - volt .",
    "the nominal atomic charges used in this work are the formal charges , that is @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the cobalt atoms of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 compounds , @xmath38 for the oxygen atoms and @xmath39 for the sodium atoms .",
    "the exclusion effects are treated using total ions pseudo - potentials  @xcite ( tip ) on the first shell of atomic sites surrounding the clusters .",
    "the calculations were done using the molcas  @xcite and casdi  @xcite suites of programs .",
    "the basis sets used can be found in reference  .",
    "the structural parameters were taken for the @xmath40 system from the 10  k data of reference   and for the @xmath41 system from reference  .",
    "the results of the ab initio calculations on an embedded fragment of the crystal provide us with energies ( @xmath42 ) and eigenfunctions ( @xmath43 ) for the local states from which the crystal ground and low lying excited states are built .",
    "even though these eigenfunctions are expanded over millions of determinants , they are dominated by only few of them , that are usually considered as the implicit basis of the effective models ( @xmath0 or hubbard in the present case ) . from the effective hamiltonian theory ( for instance such as derived in the quasi - degenerate perturbation theory  @xcite ) one can extract the main concept necessary to get the effective hamiltonian parameters from the ab initio results . indeed , the effective hamiltonian on the fragment should verify _ at the best _ the following set of equations @xmath44 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the ab initio energies and eigenstates , and @xmath45 is the projection operator on the local configurations supporting @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , in the present case , these configurations can be the determinants supporting the local singlet and triplet state in the @xmath0 or hubbard model on the @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "the @xmath46 parameters are thus obtained from a mean - square fit minimization of equation  [ eq : heff ] .",
    "these mean - square fit equations can sometime be inversed and the parameters obtained from simple algebraic equations .",
    "this is for instance the case for the effective exchange @xmath47 that is the singlet - triplet excitation energy of a @xmath48 fragment .",
    "similarly , the effective transfer can be simply expressed ( see equation  [ eq : t ] in section  [ res : tj ] ) from the same excitation energy and the knowledge of the wave - functions .",
    "one should however remember that the values of the effective integrals strongly depend on the nature of the effective model . indeed the processes renormalizing the integrals in one model can be explicit in another and one should take this into account in order to avoid double counting .",
    "let us illustrate our purpose on the @xmath29 orbital energy splitting . in a hubbard model based on the cobalt @xmath5",
    "orbitals the @xmath21 fragment low lying states can be expressed as @xmath49 % \\psi_1&=&|e_{g1}^\\prime   e_{g2}^\\prime \\overline{e_{g2}^\\prime } a_{1 g } \\overline{a_{1g}}\\rangle \\\\ \\text{with energy } & & 2\\varepsilon_{a_{1 g } } + \\varepsilon_{e_{g1}^\\prime } + 2\\varepsilon_{e_{g2}^\\prime } + 2u + 8v - 4j_h\\\\[2ex ] % \\psi_2&=&|e_{g1}^\\prime \\overline{e_{g1}^\\prime } e_{g2}^\\prime   a_{1 g } \\overline{a_{1 g } } \\rangle \\\\ \\text{with energy } & & 2\\varepsilon_{a_{1 g } } + 2\\varepsilon_{e_{g1}^\\prime } + \\varepsilon_{e_{g2}^\\prime } + 2u + 8v - 4j_h\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the repulsion of two electrons on the same orbital , @xmath51 and @xmath52 the repulsion and exchange of two electrons on different @xmath5 orbitals .",
    "it results that if @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the ab initio energies associated with these states , the ab initio spectrum should be associated with the orbital energies differences @xmath56 on the contrary if one extends the model in order to explicitely treat the differences   according to the nature of the @xmath5 orbitals   in the two - electrons two - orbitals repulsion and exchange integrals , then the ab initio spectrum does no more correspond to pure orbital energy differences but rather to @xmath57 in these equations the two electrons part is non zero as soon as the @xmath58 orbitals are not pure @xmath29 ones , but rather @xmath29-@xmath4 hybrids , as it is the case as soon as the trigonal distortion sets in ( see reference   and section  [ res : hyb ] for the present results ) . whether the racah s parameters are explicitely included in the model or the spherical approximation used , one should thus use different @xmath59 effective orbital energy differences in order for the effective hamiltonian to fit the same ab initio spectrum . in the case of @xmath9 layers",
    "it means different ordering for the @xmath2 and @xmath58 orbitals ( see reference  ) .",
    "as usually done , we will use the spherical approximation in this work and renormalize the orbital energies by the effect of the racah s parameters .",
    "a strong controversy has been going on in the literature about the cobalt 3d orbital splitting .",
    "indeed , authors did not agree on the relative order of the @xmath29 orbitals under the trigonal distortion of the regular octahedron ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the origin of the controversy was the fact that the crystalline field theory  @xcite as well as some lda calculations  @xcite found the @xmath2 orbital of lower energy than the @xmath3 ones , while other density functional calculations  @xcite , as well as quantum chemical calculations  @xcite or arpes experimental results  @xcite found them of reverse order .",
    "we recently showed  @xcite that the origin of the controversy was an incorrect treatment of the exchange and correlation integrals within the 3d shell .",
    "indeed , only when these effects are taken into account with their whole complexity   that is when the orbital dependence of the two - electron two - orbital on - site repulsion and exchange are correctly treated   , the relative order between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals issued from the @xmath29 is correctly predicted .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case in the lda approximation ( essentially due to the local exchange ) and thus lda predicts incorrect @xmath2@xmath3 ordering .",
    "this splitting is however one of the crucial parameter for the determination of the nature of fermi level states as recently shown by marianetti _",
    "et al _  @xcite",
    ". indeed , they showed ( using dmft calculations ) that the existence of the @xmath3 pockets in the fermi surface of the @xmath23 compounds are directly related to the this splitting .",
    "one can thus conclude that the discrepancy between lda and arpes fermi surfaces can be directly related to the improper treatment of the b racah parameter in lda .",
    "in fact , one can expect that an orbital dependant lda+u , where the whole complexity of the racah parameters would be included , should yield fermi surfaces in agreement with the experimental ones .",
    "we thus computed the @xmath29 orbitals splitting in the two compounds , for the different cobalt sites .",
    "these values can be extracted from the spectroscopy of the @xmath61 embedded fragments .",
    "indeed , the excitation energy between the three cobalt states , where one hole is located on one of the @xmath29 orbitals , yield the effective splittings between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "the relative order of the @xmath29 orbitals is displayed on figure  [ f : orbsplt ] .",
    "one sees immediately that the @xmath2 orbitals are always higher than the @xmath3 ones as can be expected from reference  . in the @xmath17 system",
    ", both sites exhibit @xmath2 orbitals about 250300  mev higher than the @xmath3 ones .",
    "similarly , in our dimer calculations we see that the @xmath62 ion is globally of lower energy than the @xmath63 ion . indeed",
    ", our calculations yield a global charge order of about 0.17 electrons in favor of the co(1 ) site .",
    "this result is in agreement with the common sense expectations that will favor a smaller valence for the cobalt with the largest number of @xmath31 cations neighbors .",
    "indeed , computing the electrostatic potential difference between the two cobalt sites one finds the co(1 ) site about 315  mev lower than the co(2 ) site .",
    "this result is however in contradiction with the bond valence sum ( bvs ) model , since the later yields a charge ordering of 0.12 electron in favor of the co(2 ) site  @xcite , however it is in agreement with the lda+u calculations  @xcite ( @xmath64 in favor of co(1 ) ) . in the pure @xmath9 system ,",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath3 orbital splitting is very large , much larger than in any of the other @xmath65 systems , even larger than in the superconducting compound .",
    "this very large splitting can be easily explained from ( i ) the large trigonal distortion ( the largest observed in this family ) and ( ii ) the very small co  o distances .",
    "indeed , it was shown in reference   that ( i ) the orbital splitting increases with increasing trigonal distortion and ( ii ) that the slope of the splitting as a function of the distortion increases linearly with decreasing co  o distances .",
    "let us now focus on the cobalt 3d orbital hybridization .",
    "these orbitals can hybridize in two ways  : with the oxygen ligands 2p orbitals , but also within the cobalt 3d shell between the @xmath29 and @xmath4 sets of the regular octahedron .",
    "indeed , it was shown ( see ref .   for details ) that not only this hybridization is symmetry allowed by the trigonal distortion of the octahedron , but also that it is responsible for the lowering of the @xmath58 orbitals compared to the @xmath2 one .",
    "the @xmath29@xmath4 hybridization angle is reported in table  [ t : hybd ] and found to be non negligible , of the same order of magnitude as found in the other @xmath9-based systems .",
    "the @xmath29@xmath4 hybridization is larger for @xmath18 than for @xmath17 , as can be expected from the larger trigonal distortion .",
    "c|ddd orbital & & + & & & + @xmath66 & 11.59 & 11.54 & 11.86 + @xmath67 & 8.21 & 10.18 & 11.86 +    as far as the cobalt ligand hybridization is concerned , we found it to be weak for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals , with less than 10% weight on the oxygens .",
    "it is however quite large for the empty @xmath4 orbitals with 40 to 45% weight on the neighboring oxygens .",
    "let us now focus on the interactions between two first neighbor cobalt atoms .",
    "many authors assume that the low energy physics of this compound is determined by the @xmath2 orbitals only .",
    "the large @xmath2@xmath3 orbital splitting found in our calculations seem to support this assumption .",
    "we thus computed the effective integrals both for a @xmath0 model and a one - band hubbard model .    analyzing the low temperature crystallographic structure of @xmath40 ( 10  k data of reference  )",
    ", one sees that there are four types of independent @xmath68@xmath68 bonds ( see figure  [ f : ab ] ) , the co(1)co(1 ) bond , the co(2)co(2 ) bond and two kinds of co(1)co(2 ) bonds , namely those where the cobalt  cobalt interactions are mediated by one o(1 ) and one o(3 ) oxygen ligands and those where the cobalt  cobalt interactions are mediated by one o(2 ) and one o(3 ) oxygen ligands ( see figure  [ f : ab ] ) .",

    "the magnetic coupling was computed to be much larger with @xmath72 in our notations , the negative integrals correspond to antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "we thus find all exchange integrals , both in the @xmath18 and @xmath17 compounds , antiferromagnetic , in agreement with the neutron scattering  @xcite and nmr  @xcite data .",
    "one should notice that the exchange integrals are strongly modulated according to the local environment .",
    "indeed , they differ by a factor larger than two for the different bond of the @xmath17 system .",
    "it results that this system will be described by a strongly inhomogeneous @xmath0 model . in the @xmath18",
    "compound the afm exchange is very large , in agreement with nmr experimental results  @xcite .",
    "the difference in magnitude between the antiferromagnetic coupling of the @xmath18 , @xmath17 and superconducting system  @xcite can easily be explained by the variations in the co  o distances .",
    "indeed , these distances control for a large part the super - exchange term of the coupling that increases with decreasing distances .",
    "it results that following de vaulx _ et al _",
    "@xcite we found that afm fluctuations increase with decreasing @xmath6 .",
    "let us now focus on the hopping integrals .",
    "one can get them either from the charge fluctuation in the singlet state of the @xmath73@xmath74 fragments , or from the spectroscopy of the @xmath75@xmath74 fragments .",
    "a simple analysis shows that the two hopping integrals are somewhat different . in the first case ,",
    "there is only one spectator electron on the bond , while in the second case , there are two of them ( see figure  [ f : hop ] ) .",
    "it results in a different evaluation of the hopping integrals according to the number of spectator electrons . @xmath76 where the @xmath77 and @xmath78 labels refers to the arbitrary _",
    "`` left '' _ and _ `` right '' _ atoms in the fragment , and @xmath79 is the single electron hamiltonian part .",
    "@xmath80 can be extracted from the @xmath73@xmath81 fragment . indeed , mapping a single band hubbard model on the computed low - energy singlet and triplet states wave functions and energies ,",
    "one gets after a little algebra @xmath82 assuming the following form for the computed singlet and triplet wave functions @xmath83 % \\psi_{tp}&= & \\frac{|d_l\\bar d_r\\rangle - |d_r\\bar d_l\\rangle   } { \\sqrt{2 } }    + \\text{small terms } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 is the effective on - site repulsion of a simple hubbard model .",
    "let us remind that it accounts for both the average on - site repulsion between the two sites , @xmath86 , and the nearest neighbor effective repulsion between the cobalt atoms , @xmath87 .",

    "once again , one sees that the effective transfer integrals are strongly dependant on the local environment of the cobalts and that the @xmath40 system is more inhomogeneous than first thought . in the pure compound ,",
    "the effective transfer between the @xmath2 orbitals of nn atoms is larger than both in the @xmath17 and the superconducting system .",
    "the relative variations of the co  o and large co ",
    "co distances between these three systems support the idea that the effective transfer integrals are dominated by the ligand - mediated term rather than the direct hopping term , despite the short metal - metal distances in these edge - sharing compounds .",
    "the transfer integrals with two spectator electrons on the bond , @xmath90 , can be extracted from the low - energy states of the @xmath91@xmath74 fragments .",
    "there are six low energy states according to the localization of the hole on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "the associated effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath92 where @xmath93 are the atomic effective orbital energies ( see figure  [ f : orbsplt ] ) , @xmath94 are the effective transfer integrals ( direct plus mediated by the oxygen ligands ) between the @xmath95 orbital of one cobalt and @xmath96 of the other .",
    "@xmath97 are effective intra - atomic transfer integrals between the @xmath98 and @xmath99 orbitals of the same atom .",
    "one may be surprised to find such terms , since the direct integrals are zero due to the @xmath100 symmetry , however the coupling with the bridging oxygen @xmath101 orbitals yield in second order perturbation theory an effective intra - atomic transfer term of @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 refers to the @xmath5 orbitals of the same cobalt atom , the sum over @xmath105 runs over all the ligand bridging orbitals , @xmath106 is the cobalt @xmath95ligand hopping integrals and @xmath107 is the excitation energy toward the ligand - to - metal charge transfer configuration . for a more detailed description of the underlying mechanism , one can refer to reference  .",
    "summing the @xmath97 contributions coming from the six oxygens around a cobalt atom , one can show that they exactly cancel out in a symmetric system . in the present system ,",
    "where the atomic @xmath108 symmetry is not exactly respected , these terms will certainly not exactly cancel out , however , one can expect that their sum will remain very weak .",
    "table  [ t : t2e ] displays the different effective integrals involved in matrix  [ eq : h ] for the @xmath17 system .",
    ".effective ( electron-)hopping integrals between @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals of two neighboring cobalt atoms ( in mev ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     one sees immediately that the dominant transfer integrals are the inter - atomic hopping between two @xmath2 orbitals and two @xmath66 orbitals , in agreement with what we found on the superconducting compound .",
    "all other integrals are relatively weak ( @xmath109 ) and can probably be omitted in a simple model .",
    "comparing these values with what we found on the superconductor system , one sees that they are of the same order of magnitude , except for the inter - atomic hopping between the @xmath2 orbital of one cobalt and the @xmath67 orbital of the other . indeed , the larger value found in the superconducting systems ( -53  mev ) is now spread over the three @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 hopping terms , due to local symmetry breaking .",
    "let us now examine what we find for on - site the repulsion @xmath50 from our calculations .",
    "indeed , as detailed in equation  [ eq : u ] , the value of @xmath85 can be extracted from the singlet and triplet energies and wave functions on the @xmath73@xmath74 fragments .",
    "results for a single band model are presented in table  [ t : u ] .",

    "once again correlating this fact with the co  o distances one sees that the larger the co  o distances , the weaker the cobalt on - site repulsion .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that a larger volume of the coordination shell around the metal atom will allow its magnetic orbitals to spread over some more and this reduce the intra - orbital repulsion .",
    "if one now looks at the correlation strength ( @xmath114 ) rather than the on - site repulsion value , one sees that the tendency is reverse .",
    "indeed , the larger the sodium content , the larger the correlation strength .",
    "it is easy to see that the opposite variation of the correlation strength and the one - site repulsion , as a function of @xmath6 , is again due to the co  o distances . indeed ,",
    "if an increase of the metal coordination sphere induce a decrease of the effective @xmath50 , it induces a much stronger reduction of the effective hopping integral @xmath115 , thus resulting in weaker electronic correlation .",
    "this results fit quite well with what was originally supposed ( from experimental observations ) in these systems , that is a decrease of the correlation strength with @xmath6 .",
    "however it seems hard to say that these systems are weakly correlated , since the smallest @xmath114 ratio is 15 .",
    "we determined the effective on - site and nearest - neighbor coupling parameters for the the @xmath27 and @xmath9 compounds within hubbard and @xmath0 models .",
    "the effective integrals and orbital energies were computed using ab - initio quantum chemical methods treating exactly the strong correlation effects within the cobalt @xmath5 shell and the screening effects up to the double - excitations .",
    "the hubbard on - site repulsion and the correlation strength @xmath114 were found to vary in opposite ways with the sodium content . indeed , when doping the @xmath116 layer , the @xmath115 value decreases more rapidly than the @xmath50 value and the resulting correlation strength increases . for the @xmath18 limit , however , the system is still strongly correlated with @xmath8 .",
    "this result is in disagreement with onoda s conclusion that the @xmath9 compound is a weakly correlated metal  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "julien  @xcite concludes the system is a strongly correlated metal close to the mott phase transition .",
    "our results clearly do agree with the latter hypothesis , indeed , it was shown using dmft calculation that the hubbard model reach the mott transition in a triangular lattice at a critical correlation strength of @xmath117  @xcite .",
    "our evaluation of the correlation strength  : @xmath118 , clearly situates the @xmath9 compound very close to the mott transition .",
    "similarly , our results are in agreement with nmr measurements  @xcite that sees an increase of the antiferromagnetic coupling with decreasing sodium content .",
    "however , contrarily to kawasaki _",
    "@xcite we do not find the pure @xmath116 compound behaving on a specific way .",
    "indeed , we found it to display the largest antiferromagnetic coupling among all the systems we studied .",
    "we determined the ligand field splitting for the different crystallographically independent cobalts of the @xmath27 and @xmath116 compounds .",
    "as for the superconducting compound , we find that the @xmath2 orbitals are of higher energy than the @xmath58 ones , yielding a @xmath119 cobalt atomic configuration . comparing the @xmath29 splitting in these two compounds with the splitting in the superconducting compound",
    ", we see that it follows the behavior predicted in our previous work   both as a function of the amplitude of the trigonal distortion and as the size of the cobalt first coordination shell .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath9 compound , the average distance between the oxygen and cobalt planes is 0.85 while it is 0.88 in the superconducting system and ranges between 0.95 and 0.98 in the @xmath17 compound .",
    "as this distance increases with increasing electron doping of the @xmath9 layer , the splitting between the @xmath58 and @xmath2 orbitals decreases , being maximum for the pure system . comparing this orbital order with the lda or lda+u calculations one sees that it is reverse order .",
    "indeed , tight - binding fitting of the lda+u calculations yield a higher hole energy by about 0.01ev when located in the @xmath2 orbital  @xcite .",
    "why do lda calculations yield a reverse order between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 atomic orbitals than wave - function cluster calculations ?",
    "the answer is in the treatment of the coulomb and exchange terms within the 3d shell .",
    "indeed , in lda calculations the correlation and exchange contributions are treated using a local approximation .",
    "it means that the small differences in energy that should occur in these term according to the nature of the occupied 3d orbitals ( the @xmath120 racah s parameter ) is ignored .",
    "this is even worse with lda+u calculations since the hartree term is also replaced and a unique @xmath50 ( or rather @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) is used while the coulomb and exchange integrals between two different @xmath5 orbitals depend on the nature of the considered orbitals .",
    "these integrals differences are quite small and , in most cases , the averaging is valid enough . in the present case , however , it can be shown that the 2-electron contribution to the orbital energy that is responsible for the @xmath2@xmath3 inversion in reference  , is a direct function of the racah s @xmath120 integral , and of the coulomb and exchange integrals differences .",
    "the effects of these imperfect exchange and correlation treatment within the 3d shell , and thus of the resulting orbital order between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals is to pop up the band issued from the later in comparison with the bands issued from the former .",
    "indeed , it was shown by marianetti _",
    "@xcite ( using dmft calculations ) that when the @xmath2 orbital is supposed of higher energy ( lower hole energy ) than the @xmath3 orbital , the @xmath3 pockets in the fermi surface disappear .",
    "more recently bourgeois _",
    "@xcite showed that using orbital splitting of the same sign and order of magnitude as in the present work , dmft fermi surfaces and band structure nicely fit the arpes data ( they studied different systems ranging from @xmath121 to @xmath122 ) . in view of our results and",
    "the above analysis we think that the @xmath3 fermi pockets found in lda calculations and not observed in arpes experiments are due to an intrinsic feature of the lda exchange and correlation functional and thus that these pockets are true artefacts of the method .",
    "finally , one should remember the strong variation of the effective exchange and hopping integrals as a function of the local distortions .",
    "this fact can be of importance in the understanding of the changes in magnetic behavior , as a function of @xmath6 , in the @xmath65 family .",
    "it would thus be of interest to see if the local distortions observed for larger @xmath6 values will be able to reverse the sign of the magnetic exchange as suggested by neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "the authors thank daniel maynau for providing us with the casdi suite of programs .",
