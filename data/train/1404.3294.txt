    "these are also great times for fresh graduate students to get into this area of research , which is going to remain very active for the next decade at least .",
    "the field is maturing as evidenced by the increasing number of text books that are now available @xcite . also available",
    "are collected review articles ; see @xcite .",
    "this is a fascinating inter - disciplinary area of research at the interface of particle physics and high - energy nuclear physics .",
    "it draws heavily from qcd  perturbative , non - perturbative , as well as semiclassical .",
    "it has overlaps with thermal field theory , relativistic fluid dynamics , kinetic or transport theory , quantum collision theory , apart from the standard statistical mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at high temperature , @xmath0 , and vanishing net baryon number density , @xmath1 ( or equivalently the corresponding chemical potential , @xmath2 ) , is of cosmological interest , while qgp at low @xmath0 and large @xmath1 is of astrophysical interest .",

    "[ phdiags](a ) .",
    "it shows three broad regions separated by phase transition lines , the triple point where all three phases coexist , and the critical point where the vapour pressure curve terminates and two distinct coexisting phases , namely liquid and gas , become identical .",
    "all these features are well - established experimentally to a great accuracy . in contrast the qcd phase diagram ( fig .  [ phdiags](b ) ) is known only schematically , except for the lattice qcd predictions at vanishing or small @xmath2 , in particular the prediction of a crossover transition around @xmath7 - 170 mev @xcite for vanishing @xmath2 . as arguments based on a variety of models indicate a first - order phase transition as a function of temperature at finite @xmath2 , one expects the phase transition line to end at a critical point . the existence of the critical point , however , is not established experimentally . apart from the region of hadrons at the low enough @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and the region of quarks and gluons at high @xmath0 and @xmath2 , there is also a region characterized by colour superconductivity , at high @xmath2 and low @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , precise boundaries separating these regions are not known experimentally .",
    "actually the qcd phase diagram may be richer than what is shown in fig .",
    "[ phdiags](b ) @xcite . before we proceed further",
    ", a precise definition of qgp is in order .",
    "we follow the definition proposed by the star collaboration at rhic : quark - gluon plasma is defined as a ( locally ) thermally equilibrated state of matter in which quarks and gluons are deconfined from hadrons , so that they propagate over _ nuclear _ , rather than merely _ nucleonic _ , volumes @xcite .",
    "note the two essential ingredients of this definition , ( a ) the constituents of the matter should be quarks and gluons , and ( b ) the matter should have attained ( local ) thermal equilibrium .",
    "any claim of discovery of qgp can follow only after these two requirements are shown to be fulfilled unambiguously .",
    "the big idea thus is to map out ( quantitatively ) the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the main theoretical tool at our disposal is , of course , the lattice qcd .",
    "although it allows first - principle calculations , it has technical difficulties for non - vanishing @xmath2 or @xmath1 .",
    "we also have various effective theories and phenomenological models which indeed are the basis of the schematic phase diagram of qcd shown in fig . [ phdiags](b ) .",
    "experimental tools available to us are the relativistic heavy - ion colliders such as those at bnl and cern , and the upcoming lower - energy facilities namely facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) at gsi and nuclotron - based ion collider facility ( nica ) at jinr . apart from these terrestrial facilities ,",
    "astronomy of neutron stars can also throw light on the low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 region of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "figure [ lqcd ] shows the lattice results for the qcd equation of state ( eos ) at vanishing chemical potential in the temperature range @xmath8 mev for physical light and strange quark masses @xmath9 .",
    "note that both energy density ( @xmath10 ) and pressure ( @xmath11 ) rise rapidly around @xmath12 mev , indicating an increase in entropy or the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this is consistent with the deconfinement transition with a concomitant release of the partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the rise of @xmath11 is less rapid than that of @xmath10 as expected : the square of the speed of sound @xmath13 can not exceed unity .",
    "note also that in the limit of high @xmath0 , the eos approaches the form @xmath14 expected of massless particles .",
    "however , @xmath10 is significantly less than @xmath15 showing that the system is far from being in an ideal gaseous state .",
    "lattice results indicate that the transition at vanishing @xmath2 is merely an analytic crossover .",
    "although there is no strict phase transition , it is common to use the words confined and deconfined phases to describe the low- and high - temperature regimes . for a recent review of the lattice qcd at non - zero temperature ,",

    "] nuclei is thought to proceed as follows .",
    "each incoming nucleus can be looked upon as a coherent @xcite cloud of partons ( more precisely , a colour - glass - condensate ( cgc ) plate @xcite ) .",
    "the collision results in shattering of the two cgc plates .",
    "a significant fraction of the incoming kinetic energy is deposited in the central region leading to a high - energy - density fireball ( more precisely , a highly non - equilibrium state called glasma @xcite ) .",
    "this is still a coherent state and liberation of partons from the glasma takes a finite amount of ( proper ) time ( a fraction of a @xmath17 ) .",
    "subsequently collisions among partons lead to a nearly thermalized ( local thermalization ! ) state called qgp .",
    "this happens at a time of the order of 1 @xmath17  a less understood aspect of the entire process .",
    "due to near thermalization , the subsequent evolution of the system proceeds as per relativistic imperfect fluid dynamics .",
    "this involves expansion , cooling , and dilution .",
    "eventually the system hadronizes .",
    "hadrons continue to collide among themselves elastically which changes their energy - momenta , as well as inelastically which alters abundances of individual species .",
    "chemical freezeout occurs when inelastic processes stop .",
    "kinetic freezeout occurs when elastic scatterings too stop .",
    "these late stages of evolution when the system is no longer in local equilibrium are simulated using the relativistic kinetic theory framework .",
    "hadrons decouple from the system approximately 10 - 15 @xmath17 after the collision and travel towards the surrounding detectors . from the volume of experimental data",
    "thus collected one has to establish whether qgp was formed and if so , extract its properties .",
    "after years of work a standard model of urhics has emerged : the initial state is constructed using either the glauber model @xcite or one of the models implementing ideas originating from cgc @xcite ; for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "the intermediate evolution is considered using some version of the mller - israel - stewart - like theory @xcite of causal relativistic imperfect fluid dynamics , together with a qcd equation of state spanning partonic and hadronic phases @xcite .",
    "the end evolution of the hadron - rich medium leading to a freezeout uses the boltzmann equation in the relativistic transport theory @xcite .",
    "the final state consists of thousands of particles ( mesons , baryons , leptons , photons , light nuclei ) .",
    "detailed measurements ( single - particle inclusive , two- and multi - particle correlations , etc . ) are available , spanning the energy range from sps to rhic to lhc , for various colliding nuclei , centralities , ( pseudo)rapidities , and transverse momenta .",
    "the aim is to achieve a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic and transport properties of qgp , its eos , its transport coefficients ( shear and bulk viscosities , diffusivity , conductivity ) , etc .",
    "the major hurdles in this endeavour are an inadequate knowledge of the initial state and event - to - event fluctuations at nucleonic and sub - nucleonic levels in the initial state .",
    "elliptic flow and jet quenching are arguably the two most important observables in this field .",
    "observation of an elliptic flow almost as large as that predicted by ideal ( equilibrium ) hydrodynamics led to the claim of formation of an almost perfect fluid at rhic @xcite .",
    "a natural explanation of the observed jet quenching is in terms of a dense and coloured ( hence partonic , not hadronic ) medium that is rather opaque to high - momentum hadrons .",
    "recall the definition of qgp given in section 1 .",
    "the two essential requirements mentioned there seem to be fulfilled considering these two observations together .",
    "before i discuss these two observations in detail , let me explain what is meant by an almost perfect fluid .",
    "air and water are the two most common fluids we encounter . which of them is more viscous ?",
    "water has a higher coefficient of shear viscosity ( @xmath18 ) than air , and appears more viscous .",
    "but that is misleading . to compare different fluids",
    ", one should consider their kinematic viscosities defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the density .",
    "air has a higher kinematic viscosity and hence is actually more viscous than water ! relativistic analogue of @xmath19 is the dimensionless ratio @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the entropy density .",
    "scaling by @xmath22 is appropriate because number density is ill - defined in the relativistic case .",
    "figure [ lacey ] shows constant - pressure ( @xmath23 ) curves for @xmath21 as a function of temperature for various fluids , namely water , nitrogen , helium , and the fluid formed at rhic .",
    "all fluids show a minimum at the critical temperature , and among them the rhic fluid has the lowest @xmath21 , even lower than that of helium .",
    "hence it is the most perfect fluid observed so far much smaller than that for helium @xcite . ] . for water , nitrogen , and helium , points to the left ( right ) of the minimum refer to the liquid ( gaseous ) phase .",
    "as @xmath0 rises , @xmath21 for these liquids drops , attains a minimum at the critical temperature @xmath24 , and then in the gaseous phase it rises .",
    "this is because liquids and gases transport momentum differently @xcite .",
    "rhic fluid is an example of a strongly coupled quantum fluid and has been called sqgp to distinguish it from weakly coupled qgp or wqgp expected at extremely high temperatures . interestingly ,",
    "the liquid formed at rhic and lhc cools into a ( hadron resonance ) gas !    ) curves for ( shear viscosity / entropy density ) vs temperature .",
    "@xmath24 is the critical temperature of the liquid - gas phase transition .",

    "<S> the field of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is introduced to the high - energy physics students with no prior knowledge in this area . </S>",
    "<S> the emphasis is on the two most important observables , namely the azimuthal collective flow and jet quenching , and on the role fluid dynamics plays in the interpretation of the data . </S>",
    "<S> other important observables described briefly are constituent quark number scaling , ratios of particle abundances , strangeness enhancement , and sequential melting of heavy quarkonia . </S>",
    "<S> comparison is made of some of the basic heavy - ion results obtained at lhc with those obtained at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> initial findings at lhc which seem to be in apparent conflict with the accumulated rhic data are highlighted . </S>"
