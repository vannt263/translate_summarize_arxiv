    "investigation of high - energy interactions of virtual photons with nucleons and nuclei gives information on the dynamics of high - density partonic systems as well as on the transition between perturbative and nonperturbative regimes in qcd .",
    "experiments at hera have found two extremely important properties of small-@xmath0 physics  : a fast increase of parton densities as @xmath0 decreases and the existence of substantial diffractive production in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "there are good reasons to believe that the fast increase of the @xmath5 with energy in the hera energy range will change to a milder ( logarithmic ) increase at much higher energies .",
    "this is due to unitarity effects , which are related to shadowing in highly dense systems of partons - with eventual `` saturation '' of densities .",
    "this problem has a long history ( for reviews see @xcite ) and has been extensively discussed in recent years @xcite .",
    "it is closely connected to the problem of the dynamics of very high - energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will address the problem of unitarization in @xmath1-interactions using the reggeon calculus @xcite with a supercritical pomeron ( @xmath6 ) . in this approach",
    "the unitarization effects mentioned above are described by multi - pomeron exchanges .",
    "the problem of the pomeron in qcd is not solved yet .",
    "the calculation based on qcd perturbation theory leads to the so - called bfkl - pomeron @xcite and the problem of unitarization for such pomeron has been considered by many authors @xcite-@xcite in the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "however , recent calculations @xcite indicate that nlo corrections are large and modify substantially the picture of high - energy interactions .",
    "in particular the intercept of the leading regge pole depends on nonperturbative effects @xcite .    here",
    ", we will use a more phenomenological approach and will assume that the pomeron is a simple pole with an intercept @xmath7 determined from the analysis of high - energy hadronic interaction - when all multi - pomeron contributions are taken into account @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that the increase of the effective intercept of the pomeron , @xmath8 , as @xmath2 increases from zero to several gev@xmath9 is mostly due to a decrease of shadowing effects with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "a parametrization of the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath10 such that @xmath11 for @xmath12 ( as in soft hadronic interactions ) and @xmath13 ( our input or bare pomeron intercept ) for @xmath2 of the order of a few gev@xmath9 , gives a good description of all existing data on @xmath1 total cross - sections in the region of @xmath14  gev@xmath9 @xcite . at larger @xmath2 ,",
    "effects due to qcd evolution become important . using the above parametrization as initial condition in the qcd evolution equation , allows to describe the data in the whole region of @xmath2 studied at hera @xcite .    in the reggeon calculus",
    "@xcite the amount of rescatterings is closely related to diffractive production .",
    "agk - cutting rules @xcite allow to calculate the cross - section of inelastic diffraction if contributions of multi - pomeron exchanges to the elastic scattering amplitude are known .",
    "thus , it is very important for self - consistency of theoretical models to describe not only total cross - sections , but , simultaneously , inelastic diffraction .",
    "indeed , in the reggeon calculus the variation of @xmath10 with @xmath2 is directly related to the corresponding variation of the ratio of diffractive to total cross - sections .    in this paper",
    "we present an explicit model which leads to the pattern of energy behaviour of @xmath15 for different @xmath2 described above .",
    "moreover , it allows to describe simultaneously diffraction production by real and virtual photons .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  2 the model",
    "is described .",
    "section  3 contains the expressions of the total cross - section @xmath16 .",
    "formulae for diffractive production are given in section  4 .",
    "section  5 is devoted to the description of experimental data on @xmath17 and diffraction dissociation of the photon . in section  6",
    "we compare our results with results of other authors on this subject , discuss the problem of `` saturation '' and give predictions for future experiments .",
    "the parameters of the model and their numerical values are given in appendix  1 .",
    "the amplitude of elastic @xmath1 scattering at very high energy can be described in terms of the single pomeron exchange ( fig .",
    "1a ) and multi - pomeron exchanges ( figs",
    ".  1 b , 1c ) .",
    "the pomeron exchange contribution to @xmath16 ( or to the structure function @xmath18 ) , increases as @xmath19 at small @xmath20 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath21-pomeron exchange behaves as @xmath22 .",
    "these contributions are important at very small-@xmath0 to restore unitarity .",
    "a resummation of multi - pomeron contribution is provided by gribov reggeon calculus @xcite . in this approach a two - pomeron exchange diagram ( fig .",
    "1b ) , for example , can be represented as a sum over all intermediate states ( fig .",
    "2 ) which can be diffractively produced by a single pomeron exchange .",
    "thus the magnitude of the two pomeron exchange in the elastic amplitude is related to the cross - section of diffractive production .",
    "the multi - pomeron exchanges ( fig .",
    "1c ) are related by agk - cutting rules @xcite to shadowing corrections to diffractive production .",
    "let us first discuss the main mechanisms of diffraction dissociation of a proton and of a virtual photon .",
    "for a proton the main contribution to the diagram of fig .  2 is due to the proton intermediate state .",
    "the dissociation of the proton will be taken into account in the quasi - eikonal approximation @xcite - which works well in hadronic interactions .",
    "as for a virtual photon , it can diffractively produce vector mesons ( fig .",
    "3a ) ( the so - called quasi - elastic processes ) and large mass states . for @xmath23 , the latter correspond to the triple - regge diagrams of fig .",
    "3b with @xmath24 and @xmath25-exchanges in the @xmath26-channel .",
    "models of this type allow to describe diffractive dissociation both at @xmath27 @xcite and at large @xmath2 @xcite . a simple quasi - eikonal ansatz for multi - pomeron exchanges based on this type of model was used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the description of multiparticle production in dis . however , the quasi - eikonal approximation for diffractive dissociation of a highly virtual photon is difficult to interpret in terms of reggeon diagrams - while an explicit calculation of these diagrams for multi - pomeron exchanges leads to too many parameters for the matrix of transition between different channels . for these reasons ,",
    "we adopt here a different approach , based on the quark - parton picture of high - energy interaction of a real or virtual photon .    taking into account that a photon dissociates into a @xmath28-pair and",
    "this pair can have multiple interactions with the target , we separate such pairs into two groups  : `` aligned '' or asymmetric configurations , which will be denoted by @xmath29 and the rest or symmetric configurations denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath29-configuration was introduced by bjorken and kogut @xcite in the framework of the parton model in dis and is characterized by a strongly asymmetric distribution of the relative longitudinal momenta of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 or viceversa ) .",
    "this separation into @xmath29 and @xmath30 components is very important at large @xmath2 , where the @xmath29-configuration has a large transverse size and a large interaction cross - section with the proton , while the @xmath30-component has small transverse size ( @xmath35 ) and a small cross - section . on the other hand the probability of the @xmath29-configuration decreases as @xmath36 and both configurations lead to the same behaviour , @xmath37 , at large @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "what is important , however , is that these two components give rise to a different behavior for diffraction  : the @xmath29-component gives the same @xmath36 behaviour for total and diffractive cross - sections , while the @xmath30-component leads to a diffractive cross - section which decreases as @xmath38 at large @xmath2 .",
    "these results are well known and have been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite in connection with hera experiments .",
    "the @xmath28-state is described , in general , by non - perturbative dynamics and only for large @xmath2 and small size component it is possible to use perturbative qcd .",
    "finally , we stress that at present energies , due to phase space limitations , only diagrams with none or one triple reggeon interactions are important . in particular large mass diffraction corresponds to a triple pomeron interaction diagram .",
    "however , to be more general we resum all fan - type diagrams - of the type shown in fig .  4 .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",

    "these authors , however , postulated an unconventional form for the elastic @xmath1-amplitude and it is not clear which diagrams lead to these unitarization effects . we agree with their conclusion that for the structure function @xmath118 the unitarization effects at hera energies are important mostly in the region of rather small @xmath139  gev@xmath9 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath140  gev@xmath9 , the experimental value of @xmath10 is close to the one of the input ( bare ) pomeron @xmath135 . within our approach",
    "this is only possible if the @xmath30-component ( where unitarity corrections are higher twists ) dominates .",
    "however , some unitarity corrections are present at large @xmath2 due to the @xmath29-component and the triple pomeron interaction",
    ". moreover , they will become more important at higher energies ( see the discussion in the next paragraph ) .",
    "however , we differ in many details from their predictions on the properties of diffractive production at large @xmath2 and on the pattern of `` saturation '' of parton densities at large @xmath2 and extremely small @xmath0 .",
    "let us now discuss the saturation patterns in our model , i.e. the properties of @xmath141 in the limit @xmath126 .",
    "it follows from formulae ( [ 1e])-([8e ] ) that for the @xmath29-component , which has a large cross - section , @xmath142 will tend to a saturation limit @xmath143 rather fast as energy increases . on the other hand , for the small size ( at large @xmath2 ) component ( @xmath30 )",
    "the situation is different . if we neglect the triple - pomeron contribution ( i.e. with @xmath144 in eq .",
    "( [ 5e ] ) ) , @xmath145 will increase with energy until the increase of @xmath146 does not overcompensate the smallness of @xmath147 .",
    "for such extremely large energies , cross - sections in the small impact parameter region will saturate to a @xmath2-independent value and @xmath148 .",
    "this is a usual picture of saturation in perturbative qcd @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the inclusion of the @xmath67-fan diagrams ( large distance , nonperturbative effects ) according to eqs .",
    "( [ 5e ] ) , ( [ 24e ] ) , ( [ 25e ] ) changes the picture drastically . in this case",
    "the increase of @xmath149 will compensate the increase of @xmath150 at very large @xmath47 and lead , at large @xmath2 , to a behaviour @xmath151 even for @xmath152 .",
    "( note that for large enough @xmath2 this will happen in a region where @xmath153 is still small ) .",
    "the above effects are relatively small at present energies due to the smallness of the triple pomeron vertex @xmath154 which determines the constant @xmath66 . however , in the `` saturation limit '' the properties of @xmath155 in our model are quite different from those in other models @xcite . our predictions for @xmath141 for energies higher than those accessible at hera are shown in figs .  13 .    in a forthcoming publication @xcite we introduce a different but closely related model with also two components for the interaction of the @xmath28 pair  : a large - size component , parametrized in the same way as the @xmath29-component in the present work , and a small - size component computed using the @xmath28 perturbative qcd wave function - with its longitudinal and transverse components .",
    "the results are very similar to the ones obtained here .",
    "again , a single pomeron with intercept 1.2 allows to describe the data on both total @xmath1 cross - section and diffractive production .",
    "in this appendix we give the list of all the parameters in the formulae for @xmath141 ( or @xmath123 ) and diffractive production , given in sections 3 and 4 respectively - together with their numerical values .",
    "the total cross - section of @xmath1 interactions is related to the structure function @xmath137 as follows    @xmath156    where @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "this cross - section is related by eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) to the corresponding quantity , @xmath159 , in the impact parameter space .",
    "the latter is written as the sum of two components ( eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) ) with probabilities given eq .",
    "( [ 3e ] ) where @xmath41 , @xmath160 and @xmath42 are free parameters .",
    "their values obtained from the fit are    @xmath161    for @xmath144 ( i.e. when triple reggeon vertices vanish  ; see eq .",
    "( [ 5e ] ) ) the cross - sections @xmath162 are written in a quasi - eikonal form ( eq .",
    "( [ 4e ] ) ) with born terms given by the exchange of the pomeron @xmath24 and secondary reggeon ( @xmath25 ) trajectories ) .",
    "their expressions contain the intercepts @xmath163 @xmath164 for which we take    @xmath165    they also contain five other parameters treated as free ones  : @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , ( @xmath82 ) , @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "their values obtained in the fit are :    @xmath171 @xmath172    the value of the pomeron intercept @xmath4 has been found in soft hadronic interactions @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the intercept of the bfkl pomeron at nlo . when treated as a free parameter in the fit its value turns out to be very close to the one in eq .",
    "the value of the intercept of the @xmath25 has been allowed to change within some restricted limits .",
    "the value @xmath173 leads to better results than the more conventional value @xmath174 .",
    "our expressions contain also the triple pomeron term @xmath67 whose strength is controlled by the parameter @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ 5e ] ) , and the interference term @xmath68 whose strength ( relative to the @xmath67 term ) is given by the parameter @xmath112 .",
    "we use    @xmath175    note that the value of @xmath66 obtained in the fit agrees with the value obtained from soft diffraction ( see the discussion in section 6 ) .",
    "finally we turn to the quantities    @xmath176    and    @xmath177    in eqs .",
    "( [ 5e ] ) and ( [ 24e ] ) .",
    "they are directly related to the @xmath26-dependence of the elastic @xmath1 amplitudes and of the triple reggeon vertices , respectively , and have the standard regge behavior as functions of @xmath47 - or @xmath178 .",
    "we use the conventional parameters of the reggeon slopes    @xmath179    our results for the diffractive cross - sections integrated over @xmath26 are not sensitive to the values of the parameters @xmath180 and we have fixed them to the values obtained from soft interaction data and from vector dominance .",
    "we take @xcite    @xmath181    with    @xmath182    and    @xmath183    note that the @xmath2-dependence of the @xmath184 and @xmath185 vertices for the @xmath30 component have been chosen in such a way that the corresponding radii tend to zero for @xmath186 @xcite .",
