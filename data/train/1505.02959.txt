    "the global aspect of our universe is well described by a homogeneous and isotropic flrw(friedmann - lema@xmath5tre - robertson - walker ) metric .",
    "the homogeneity over the scale of 100mpc is well established by many observations . at the same time , local inhomogeneity of our universe provides us a lot of information .",
    "one of the classical issue involved with the inhomogeneity is the so called backreaction problem(see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "evaluation of the backreaction due to the local inhomogeneity on the global expansion law has been attracted much attention because large backreaction may cause significant systematic error for evaluation of the energy components of our universe .",
    "one typical example of treating the backreaction is isaacson s formula@xcite . for gravitational waves with high frequency and low amplitude",
    ", isaacson s formula provides the coarse - grained effective energy momentum tensor which satisfies the traceless condition .",
    "since the energy momentum tensor which is compatible with the homogeneity and isotropy is given by the perfect fluid form , isaacson s formula states that the high frequency and low amplitude gravitational waves behave like a radiation fluid on average ( see appendix [ isaacson_in_freidmann ] ) .",
    "therefore , for a spatially flat flrw universe with short wavelength gravitational waves , the relation between the hubble parameter @xmath1 and the scale factor @xmath6 is expected to be @xmath7 .    the aim of this paper is to test the validity of isaacson s formula beyond the high frequency and low amplitude approximation . for the purpose ,",
    "we consider the inhomogeneous universe which only contains the gravitational waves and calculate the time evolution of this universe .",
    "because this universe is assumed to have no symmetry , it is inevitable to rely on a numerical computation to obtain its dynamics and we apply numerical relativity to tackle this problem . over the past 20 years , numerical relativity has been extensively developed mainly for isolated systems .",
    "recently , several authors applied the numerical relativity to the expanding or contracting universe models with aligned black holes and discussed the backreaction problem@xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the validity of isaacson s formula by solving the full einstein equations with the use of numerical relativity .",
    "first , we construct the initial data which contains nonlinear gravitational waves by solving constraint equations of vacuum einstein equations .",
    "this initial data is prepared in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions between each pair of opposite faces of the box and corresponds to standing wave modes in the linear approximation . concerning the time evolution ,",
    "the backreaction effect of gravitational waves causes expansion or contraction of this universe .",
    "we use the gauge condition in which the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath0 is spatially uniform .",
    "then , the hubble parameter is defined by @xmath2 .",
    "we introduce the effective scale factors @xmath3 from the proper volume , proper area , and proper length of this box .",
    "isaacson s formula states that time evolution of this system is same as the universe with the radiation fluid in the short wavelength region and the hubble parameter and the effective scale factors obey the relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant .",
    "we evaluate the relation between the hubble parameter @xmath1 and the effective scale factor @xmath3 in the numerically generated inhomogeneous universe and test the validity of this formula .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 ,",
    "the initial data are constructed by solving constraint equations of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "we describe the time evolution of our model in sec .  3 and the relation between the hubble parameter @xmath1 and the effective scale factor @xmath3 is investigated .",
    "furthermore , we report dependence of the initial amplitude on the dynamics in superhorizon scale and the effect of temporal average of the volume .",
    "is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "we use units in which @xmath10 throughout this paper .",
    "as is mentioned in the introduction , we numerically construct a solution of the vacuum einstein equations , which contains nonlinear standing gravitational waves in the cubic box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "naively thinking , since the gravitational waves have a positive energy , it causes the gravitational attractive force , so this system is unstable . actually , as we will see later , this universe inevitably expands or contracts . in this section , we describe how to construct the initial data .",
    "the initial data set is generated by solving the following hamiltonian and momentum constraints : @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the scalar curvature of 3-metric @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the covariant derivative associated with @xmath14 . for convenience , @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "are decomposed into the conformal factor @xmath18 , conformal 3-metric @xmath19 , and conformal traceless part of the extrinsic curvature @xmath20 as follows : @xmath21 using these variables , the hamiltonian constraint and the momentum constraints are written as @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the covariant derivative and the scalar curvature associated with @xmath19 , respectively . in order to construct the initial data , we solve these constraints with appropriate ansatzes .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is spatially constant and @xmath26 .",
    "these assumptions make momentum constraints trivial .",
    "furthermore , the hamiltonian constraint is reduced to @xmath27 we also assume that the conformal metric has the following form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , ( @xmath30@xcite . a constant @xmath31 specifies the coordinate wave number of the gravitational waves and @xmath32 is the phase of the gravitational waves . as we will see later , in the linear approximation , these ansatzes lead to a solution for standing gravitational waves with the amplitude @xmath33 . in this paper , for simplicity , we assume @xmath34 by this assumption , three spatial axes are equivalent to each other .",
    "we consider periodic boundary conditions for each pair of opposite faces of the numerical box .",
    "the coordinate length of the edge of the box is set to be @xmath35 . under this boundary condition , without loss of generality , we can set @xmath36    by integrating the hamiltonian constraint over the box , we obtain @xmath37 where the first term in eq .",
    "has been reduced to the boundary integral and eliminated due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "since the trace part of the extrinsic curvature gives the volume contraction rate , our solution describes expanding or contracting universe corresponding to negative or positive value of the extrinsic curvature , respectively .",
    "hamiltonian constraint is invariant under the following scaling with a constant @xmath38 : @xmath39 this ambiguity corresponds to a choice of the unit of the scale . in this paper ,",
    "the normalization is fixed by @xmath40 with the conditions and , eq .",
    "is numerically integrated by using the successive over - relaxation ( sor ) method .",
    "we show that our initial data contains gravitational waves in the linear approximation @xmath41 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that , since @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43 from eq .   and",
    "@xmath44 from the hamiltonian constraint . in this approximation ,",
    "the conformal metric becomes @xmath45 and the fluctuation part @xmath46 satisfies the transverse traceless condition .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath47 , as the equation of motion of @xmath19 is @xmath48 , @xmath26 means @xmath49 .",
    "hence , the linearized form of our initial data @xmath19 corresponds to the standing gravitational waves at the moment of maximum amplitude .",
    "remaning parameter @xmath50 corresponds to the initial amplitude of gravitational waves in the linear regime . in the short wavelength ,",
    "the linear gravitational waves have only oscillatory modes and their amplitude decreases ( increases ) with expansion ( contraction ) of the universe . on the other hand , for the super horizon wavelength , the two modes of the gravitational waves correspond to the decaying mode and the growing mode .",
    "the ratio between these two modes is fixed by the phase of the gravitational waves at the horizon crossing . in our initial data ,",
    "the phase of the gravitational standing waves is fixed so that the waves have the maximum amplitude at the initial time and the change of the value @xmath50 causes the change of the initial hubble scale .",
    "therefore the phase at the horizon crossing depends on @xmath50 and the behavior of the gravitational waves in the long wavelength regime also depends on the initial amplitude @xmath50 .",
    "we use initial data with @xmath51 and analyze the behavior of the metric both in the short wavelength region and long wavelength region .",
    "to simulate the time evolution , we use the cosmos code by appropriately modifying it for our purpose .",
    "the cosmos code is an einstein equation solver written in c++ by means of bssn formalism @xcite .",
    "the algorithm of this code is similar to the sacra code @xcite .",
    "the cosmos code has been used in papers  @xcite . in the original code ,",
    "the 4-th order finite differencing in space with uni - grid and the 4th order time integration with runge - kutta method in cartesian coordinates are adopted . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the 2nd order central differencing in space and the leapfrog method with a time filtering for time integration .",
    "because of the time reversal of the einstein equation , the time evolution is simulated not only for the expanding universe with @xmath52 , but also for the contracting direction from the same initial data with @xmath53 .",
    "our simulation has been terminated when the violation of the hamiltonian constraint exceeds 1% .      before performing the time integration , we need to fix the gauge conditions for the lapse function @xmath54 and the shift vector @xmath55 . in regard to the shift vector , we set @xmath56 for simplicity .",
    "as for the lapse function , we use the  uniform @xmath0 gauge \" condition which keeps spatially uniform @xmath0 on each time slice .",
    "let us derive the equation for the lapse function with the uniform @xmath0 gauge .",
    "the time evolution equation of @xmath0 is given by @xmath57 the uniform @xmath0 gauge condition implies that the left hand side in this equation is spatially constant . integrating this equation over the box ,",
    "the time derivative of @xmath0 is obtained by @xmath58 where the first term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "vanishes by virtue of gauss s theorem and the periodic boundary conditions . at every time step ,",
    "we solve eq .   by the sor method to determined @xmath54 .      in order to test isaacson s formula ( [ isaacson formula ] ) ,",
    "we investigate the relation between the effective hubble parameter and the effective scale factor . since our model is inhomogeneous , there is no unique definition of the hubble parameter and the scale factor .",
    "nevertheless , by virtue of the uniform @xmath0 gauge condition , the hubble parameter can be naturally defined as @xmath59 this definition coincides with the standard definition of @xmath1 for the homogeneous and isotropic universe model .",
    "one of the simplest definition of the scale factor is defined from the proper volume of the box : @xmath60 we can also define other effective scale factors from the edge proper length and the surface proper area .",
    "these definitions are used in the several previous works@xcite .",
    "the effective scale factors from the proper length and the proper area are @xmath61 since @xmath62 and @xmath63 depend on @xmath64 , we pick up the several characteristic positions as shown in fig .",

    ", we must take not only spatial average but also temporal average .",
    "we consider the spatial average is taken by the definition of effective scale factors  - .",
    "however , for temporal average , we do not have any appropriate scale for the average , since our model has no exact periodicity along the time direction .",
    "one possible way for the temporal average is proposed and discussed in the sec.[sec temporal average ] .",
    "we evaluate the difference between the effective scale factor from our numerical result and that of isaacson s formula as a function of the hubble parameter .",
    "the deviation is evaluated by @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 represent isaacson s formula   and the coefficient @xmath9 is determined by the least squares fitting of our numerical result in the region @xmath86 , which is attained by time evolution along the expanding temporal direction .",
    "let us consider the value of @xmath87 as a function of the grid spacing @xmath88 . since our numerical code has the second order accuracy , @xmath89 and its true value @xmath90 are supposed to have the relation @xmath91 where a coefficient @xmath92 is determined by numerical results .",
    "using the two data sets taken with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath92 can be obtained as @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 , we calculate the value of @xmath92 and @xmath99 .",

    "we can clearly confirm that the second order convergence is achieved from fig .",
    "[ convergence - lv ] . in the following ,",
    "we use the numerical result with @xmath102 .",
    "in this subsection , we explain the relation between the hubble parameter and the effective scale factors @xmath103 , @xmath63 , @xmath62 for the initial amplitude @xmath104 .    before discussing the result",
    ", we introduce the characteristic hubble parameter @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 by @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",

    "the parameter @xmath9 in each @xmath111 is determined by fitting the numerical data obtained by time evolution in expanding temporal direction .",
    "we define the short wavelength region @xmath112 and the long wavelength region @xmath113 in comparison with the hubble scale .",
    "the behavior of @xmath114 and @xmath115 is shown in fig .  [ the relation of h and lv ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the deviation from isaacson s formula  @xmath87 is at most about 3% in the range of our numerical calculation given by @xmath116 .",
    "although isaacson s formula is not guaranteed for @xmath117 , this formula has still a few % accuracy .",
    "behavior of @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are similar to that of the proper volume . while , for the effective scale factor defined by the proper length , deviation from the isaacson s formula depends on the line position .",
    "this means that , when we use the proper length as the effective scale factor , the position dependence must be carefully treated .",
    "we also discussed the temporal average of the effective scale factor given by the proper volume , which gives a central value of the temporal oscillation of the effective scale factor .",
    "our calculation of the temporal average suggests that the deviation of the central value from isaccson s formula is at most @xmath121 in the range of our calculation .",
    "one might expect that , when the gravitational wavelength is much longer than the hubble scale , our model approaches to the kasner solution .",
    "however , in our calculation , we could not proceed time evolution beyond @xmath122 . at this time",
    ", hamiltonian constraint is violated , and we could not see any typical feature of the kasner solution",
    ". even using the finer resolution , the violation time does not change .",
    "this time @xmath123 of the constraint violation is near the big bang singularity time @xmath124 ( see eq .",
    "( [ scale factor ] ) ) : @xmath125 therefore , this constraint violation would be originated from the big bang singularity .",
    "we need more refined numerical method to analyze the structure of the spacetime around the singularity@xcite .",
