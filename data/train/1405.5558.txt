    "given a group @xmath0 acting on a set @xmath1 , a @xmath2-coloring @xmath3 of @xmath1 is _ distinguishing _ with respect to @xmath0 if the only @xmath4 that fixes @xmath5 is the identity action .",
    "the _ distinguishing number _ of the action @xmath0 , denoted @xmath6 , is then the smallest positive integer @xmath2 such that there is a distinguishing @xmath2-colorings of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "the notion of distinguishing a general group action was introduced by tymoczko in @xcite , where a number of results on actions of @xmath19 appear , and was also addressed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the distinguishing number of @xmath20 over a field @xmath21 acting on the vector space @xmath22 was completely determined .",
    "we are most frequently concerned with the case where @xmath0 is the action of a symmetry group on some geometric or combinatorial object . in particular , the overwhelming body of work on this problem is concerned with determining the _ distinguishing number _ of a graph @xmath7 , first introduced by albertson and collins @xcite in 1996 .",
    "specifically , a vertex coloring of a graph @xmath7 , @xmath23 , is said to be _ distinguishing _ if the only automorphism of @xmath7 that preserves all of the vertex colors is the identity .",
    "the _ distinguishing number _ of a graph @xmath7 , denoted @xmath24 , is the minimum integer @xmath25 such that @xmath7 has a distinguishing @xmath25-coloring . in the notation outlined above for general group actions",
    ", we therefore have that @xmath26 .",
    "the distinguishing number of a graph has been widely studied for both finite ( see @xcite ) and , starting in @xcite , infinite ( see @xcite ) graphs .",
    "the distinguishing number of a group action is a measure of how difficult it is to `` break '' all of the permutations arising from that action ; the more colors required , the more resilient the action .",
    "almost all graphs have trivial automorphism group ( see @xcite ) , and hence have distinguishing number 1 .",
    "many other familiar graph classes have distinguishing number 2 ( see @xcite ) despite their diverse collection of automorphism groups and seemingly disparate structural properties .",
    "this leads us to ask the following :    how can we further differentiate the resilience of group actions with the same distinguishing number ?    in this paper , we propose a precoloring extension approach to this question .",
    "a _ precoloring _ of @xmath1 is a @xmath2-coloring of @xmath27 for some @xmath2 and subset @xmath28 of @xmath1 .",
    "we want to understand when a precoloring can be extended to a distinguishing @xmath2-coloring of all of @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , given a set @xmath28 where every precoloring of @xmath29 can be extended to a distinguishing coloring of @xmath1 , it follows that an arbitrary @xmath2-coloring @xmath30 of @xmath1 can be modified into a distinguishing @xmath2-coloring by changing at most the colors on @xmath28 .",
    "a precoloring of @xmath27 can not be extended to a distinguishing coloring if there is a nontrivial element @xmath31 such that @xmath32 pointwise stabilizes @xmath28 ; hence we preclude such subsets @xmath28 from our consideration .",
    "a set @xmath8 is a _ fixing set _ for @xmath0 if the pointwise stabilizer of @xmath33 in @xmath0 is trivial ; that is , for every non - identity element @xmath31 there is an element @xmath10 such that @xmath34 .",
    "we define the _ distinguishing extension number _",
    "@xmath12 to be the minimum number @xmath13 such that for all fixing sets @xmath14 with @xmath15 , every precoloring @xmath35 can be extended to a @xmath2-coloring of @xmath1 that is distinguishing under @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath7 is a graph , we write @xmath36 instead of the more cumbersome @xmath37 , and to further simplify , we write @xmath38 instead of @xmath39 and unambiguously refer to this quantity as the _ distinguishing extension number _ of @xmath7 .",
    "we similarly define @xmath40 to be the _ distinguishing extension number _ of @xmath1 .",
    "the problem of determining @xmath12 can be viewed as a partizan combinatorial game that fits under the broad umbrella of competitive graph coloring .",
    "given a group @xmath0 acting on a set @xmath1 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , two players , the hero and and the adversary , play the following game .",
    "the adversary begins by coloring all but an @xmath13-element fixing set of @xmath1 using colors from @xmath43 .",
    "the hero wins if he can extend the adversary s coloring to a distinguishing @xmath2-coloring of @xmath1 by coloring the @xmath13 uncolored elements using colors from @xmath43 .",
    "the distinguishing extension number @xmath12 is then the minimum @xmath13 such that the hero has a guaranteed win .",
    "our work in this paper is further motivated ( and contextualized ) by the following problem in graph coloring : given a graph @xmath7 and a @xmath2-coloring @xmath30 of some subset of @xmath44 , when can @xmath30 be extended to a proper @xmath2-coloring of @xmath7 ?",
    "this problem was first introduced in @xcite , and has been studied over the last twenty years not only in the context of proper colorings ( see also @xcite ) , but also for list @xcite , circular @xcite and fractional @xcite colorings of graphs . as is the case here , the broad class of precoloring extension problems provide a framework by which it is possible to contrast the colorability of graphs that have the same value of a particular coloring parameter .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : prelim ] we present some basic notions and state our main results . in section  [ sec : overview ]",
    "we discuss an overview of our proof technique , with more detailed discussion of uncolored elements in section  [ sec : uncolored ] and with the final proofs of the main results in section  [ sec : proof ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of future work in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper , we study the distinguishing extension number of the real line and the unit circle .",
    "our investigation of the latter also allows us to naturally study the distinguishing extension number of the cycle @xmath45 .",
    "we begin by more generally considering @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the action of affine linear maps @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a matrix with determinant in @xmath50 .",
    "for instance , the automorphisms of @xmath51 are compositions of translations of @xmath51 and reflections of @xmath51 about a point .",
    "let @xmath52 be the set of vectors @xmath53 with @xmath54 the automorphisms of @xmath52 are given by the @xmath55 real matrices with determinant in @xmath56 .",
    "when considering @xmath57 , we instead use the parameterization @xmath58 given by @xmath59 .",
    "hence , we consider @xmath60 , the collection of preimages of @xmath5 , to be the _ unit circle _ with automorphisms given by rotations ( @xmath61 ) and reflections ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we first consider @xmath63 .",
    "coloring @xmath64 red and @xmath65 blue is a distinguishing 2-coloring of @xmath51 , so we have that @xmath66 .",
    "next , we give a lower bound on @xmath63 .",
    "[ prop : extd_r_lb ] @xmath67 .",
    "color @xmath68 red and leave the remaining three elements blank .",
    "we claim that this coloring can not be extended to a distinguishing 2-coloring of @xmath51 . indeed , suppose that @xmath30 is an extension of this coloring that uses only colors red and blue . if @xmath30 assigns all three elements of @xmath69 the same color , then the reflection of @xmath51 about 0 fixes @xmath30 .",
    "further , if only one of the uncolored elements is colored blue , then the reflection of @xmath51 about that point preserves @xmath30 . hence we may assume that exactly two points in @xmath70 , call them @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are colored blue .",
    "it then follows that the reflection about @xmath73 preserves @xmath30 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "our first main result shows that this lower bound is sharp .",

    "first , there is an isomorphism @xmath76 between the subgroup @xmath77 of @xmath0 that setwise stabilizes @xmath78 and @xmath79 , where @xmath78 denotes the image of @xmath5 .",
    "second , it is possible to choose @xmath76 such that for each @xmath80 , the permutation @xmath81 of @xmath78 corresponding to the action of @xmath82 satisfies @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .",
    "that is , the permutation @xmath85 of @xmath86 induced by an action @xmath9 that stabilizes @xmath86 is equal to the permutation of @xmath86 induced by the corresponding automorphism @xmath87 of @xmath7 .",
    "note that for any @xmath88 , any set of @xmath89 equally spaced points on the unit circle naturally corresponds to a faithful embedding of @xmath45 into @xmath57 .",

    "the distinguishing number for graphs was introduced ( in the guise of an entertaining problem ) and determined for finite cycles in @xcite .",

    "each choice of @xmath1 has two categories of automorphisms : reflections and translations . in the case of cycles and the unit circle , translations are rotations",

    "since no extension distinguishes @xmath1 and non - forbidden extensions do not permit translations , @xmath30 must permit a reflection .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath30 does not permit the reflection about @xmath139 , no reflection permitted by @xmath30 fixes @xmath139 .",
