    "x - ray quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are among the most important observational properties of galactic x - ray binaries ( xrbs ; see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) , yielding important constraints on the mass of the central black hole ( bh ) , @xmath0 , and providing theoretical clues and constraints on the operative physical processes and geometry in the regime of strong gravity .",
    "although their origin is still a matter of scientific debate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , there is general agreement that qpos originate close to the central bh .    to date ,",
    "qpos at timescales of a few kiloseconds have also been claimed for some active galactic nuclei ( agn ) : ngc  4151 @xcite , ngc  6814 @xcite , ngc  5548 @xcite , ngc  4051 @xcite , rx  j0437.4@xmath14711 @xcite , iras  18325@xmath15926 @xcite , mcg@xmath16 - 30 - 15 @xcite , mrk  766 @xcite , and iras  13224@xmath13809 @xcite . in addition , possible long term periodicities with periods of months have been claimed for the radio loud agn mrk  421 , mrk  501 , and pks  2155@xmath1304 @xcite . some of the kilosecond qpo findings , however , are controversial , with the strongest exosat result ( ngc  5548 ) being disputed by @xcite , who attribute it mostly to periodic swapping of detectors .",
    "ngc  6814 turned out to be confused with a cataclysmic variable @xcite .",
    "given the important implications based upon detection of qpo in agn , it seems worthwhile to study the methods employed to determine their significance in detail . in this _ letter _ , we present a study of how to compute this significance using monte carlo simulations of lightcurves with the method of @xcite and using periodogram analysis and epoch folding to detect the periodicity (  [ sec : qpo ] ) .",
    "we then apply our methods to a reanalysis of the _ xmm - newton _ lightcurve of mrk  766 and find that the qpo claimed in @xcite has in fact low statistical significance (  [ sec : mkn ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] we discuss our results and comment on further work .",
    "currently , two methods for the variability analysis of astronomical sources , especially in searching for periodic signals , are common in astronomy : periodogram analysis and epoch folding .",
    "we only give a brief description of these methods here , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for in - depth discussions .",
    "based on the fourier decomposition of the lightcurve , periodogram analysis ( often called power spectrum density analysis , psd ) is especially sensitive to periodic signals with a modulation that is close to sinusoidal . on the other hand ,",
    "epoch folding ( @xmath2 ) is based on comparing pulse profiles obtained from binning the data into phase bins at a test period , @xmath3 , with a constant count rate using a @xmath4 test . in both methods ,",
    "the detection of a periodic signal is claimed if the psd value or the @xmath4 value at the period of interest is significantly above the values of the testing statistics surrounding this period .    in order to safely use either of these methods ,",
    "it is critically important to accurately estimate the significance of qpo features .",
    "this is not trivial for real agn lightcurves , which have much worse sampling and signal to noise than x - ray binary lightcurves .",
    "were the x - ray lightcurve purely dominated by white noise and evenly sampled , the significance could be easily determined from the statistical properties of the psd or from the @xmath2 statistics .",
    "this assumption , however , does not apply to agn , where the psd can be well approximated by a power - law @xmath5 with @xmath6 for the frequencies of interest @xcite .    when studying a feature in @xmath2 or a psd , we can ask two different questions : 1 .  what is the significance of a qpo peak at a given ( predefined ) frequency ( the `` local significance '' of the qpo ) , and , 2",
    "what is the significance of a qpo feature seen in a given frequency range ( the `` global significance '' of the qpo ) .",
    "note that these questions are really different questions , since we do have more knowledge about the qpo in the case of the `` local significance '' ( we do know its frequency ) , while in the case of the `` global significance '' , we are only interested in having the question answered that a feature somewhere in the interesting frequency range is significant or not . to our knowledge , however , no formulae for determining the significance of a peak in the psd or in @xmath2 exist for such red - noise lightcurves . a common approach ,",
    "therefore , is to resort to monte carlo simulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these simulations , a large number ( @xmath7 ) of lightcurves with the same statistical properties and same temporal sampling as the original lightcurve",
    "are generated and their @xmath2 is computed .    for computing the `` local significance '' , one determines the statistical distribution of the resulting @xmath2 value at the frequency of interest .",
    "a deviation of the measured @xmath2 from the red - noise @xmath2 is significant if it is above a certain threshold determined from this distribution . typically ,",
    "threshold values of 99% or even 99.9% are used @xcite .",
    "an identical procedure can be used to test the significance of a peak in the psd .    for determining the `` global significance '' ,",
    "a similar approach is used .",
    "since we are looking at @xmath2 values determined at different periods , one has to take the red - noise character of the data and window effects into account . instead of directly using @xmath2 values , more robust tests can be devised by first dividing the computed individual @xmath2 values by the average @xmath8 , obtained by averaging the @xmath2 curves of the simulated lightcurves . to determine the `` global significance '' of the maximum @xmath2-peak of an observed lightcurve",
    ", we therefore propose to compare this value to the distribution of @xmath9 from the simulated lightcurves . here , the maximum is to be taken over the period range of interest .",
    "we would consider an observed peak as likely due to a physical effect only if it is above the 99% threshold determined from the distribution .",
    "the maximum @xmath2-peaks present in the red - noise lightcurves of fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_plots]b and  c have a `` global significance '' of 61% and 80% respectively .",
    "similar global tests can also be devised for the distribution of the 2nd or 3rd largest @xmath2 value and for the significance of the largest peaks in a psd , although we will not use them here .",
    "it is crucially important how lightcurves are produced by monte carlo simulations , if the significance level of any peak seen in a red - noise psd is to be determined .",
    "one usually starts with a model psd and performs an inverse fourier transformation to obtain a lightcurve .",
    "an often used algorithm , called the `` phase randomization '' method @xcite , determines the fourier amplitude from the square root of the power - law shaped psd and assumes the fourier phase to be uniformly distributed in @xmath10 .",
    "although the psds produced by `` phase randomization '' are @xmath11 , it was pointed out by @xcite and @xcite that the resulting lightcurves do not resemble the pure red - noise process in all of their statistical properties .",
    "first , this procedure chooses a deterministic amplitude for each frequency and only randomizes the phases .",
    "all simulated lightcurves thus exhibit a trend caused by the dominating lowest frequency .",
    "secondly , the periodogram of a red - noise lightcurve must obey the usual periodogram statistics : the psd follows approximately a @xmath4 distribution with two degrees of freedom , @xmath12 , i.e. , the standard deviation of each psd point is of the same magnitude as the psd value itself such that the periodogram is fluctuating wildly ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "`` phase randomization '' does not take into account this randomness of the periodogram according to the @xmath12 distribution and therefore the uncertainty of the related distribution of the estimated periods is significantly underestimated .",
    "in other words , red - noise psds have a larger scatter than those obtained from `` phase randomization ''  including the possibility of outliers that strongly deviate from the general @xmath13 behavior .",
    "this is important since these outliers could be interpreted as quasi periodic oscillations , while in reality they result from the statistics of the red - noise process .",
    "we note that the frequent occurrence of random peaks in red - noise psds is avoided in x - ray binary work by averaging many psds to obtain the `` true psd '' of a source @xcite .",
    "for agn , averaging the psds is unfortunately not possible due to the prohibitively long observation times required .",
    "as we have mentioned above , the `` phase randomization '' algorithm will not produce lightcurves with the appropriate red - noise statistical characteristics .",
    "indeed , were one to use the monte carlo approach outlined above to lightcurves computed with `` phase randomization '' , the qpo significance would be overestimated . instead , an algorithm that produces lightcurves with the correct statistical red - noise behavior has to be used . for this purpose",
    "@xcite proposed a new algorithm .",
    "this algorithm ( used also by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows randomness both in phase and in amplitude producing the desired @xmath12 distribution in the periodogram . in the following",
    ", we will use the @xcite algorithm to simulate red - noise lightcurves . as an illustration",
    ", three simulated examples of red - noise lightcurves with significance levels obtained from the monte carlo simulations are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_plots ] .",
    "we also display the significance levels obtained with `` phase randomization '' to indicate that these levels are in fact much smaller than the correct levels and therefore would imply an overestimate in the significance of an apparent period .",
    "we note that poisson noise introduces additional `` observational noise '' in the measured lightcurves .",
    "this observational noise has to be added to the simulated lightcurves after the inverse fourier transform has been performed . for each time bin ,",
    "the number of observed photons is drawn from a poisson distribution with its mean given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the simulated count rate and @xmath16 is the binning . for data with new instruments such as _ xmm - newton _",
    ", with a high signal to noise ratio , this latter step can be ignored if the source is bright enough .",
    "for example , with @xmath17s , `` observational noise '' contributes less than 3% to the mrk  766 lightcurve . for earlier instruments such a simplification of the monte carlo algorithm",
    "is not possible .",
    "we note that in earlier work employing `` phase randomization '' and the addition of observational noise , the resulting psd statistics would asymptotically approach the @xmath12 distribution and therefore the overestimation of the period significance would be less than with newer data with a high signal to noise ratio .",
    "we now apply the methods outlined in the previous section to the putative qpo in _ xmm - newton _ data of mrk  766 taken during revolution 0082 .",
    "we concentrate on data from the epic - pn instrument @xcite which was operated in the small window mode during the observation .",
    "we extracted source photons from a circle of 9.5 pixels radius centered on the source ( detector coordinates ( 37.5,54 ) ) .",
    "for the background , data from an off - axis position ( 18,17.5 ) extracted with a circle of then same radius were used .",
    "the time range of the lightcurve was chosen to be consistent with the approach of @xcite and results in an exposure time of 29ksec .",
    "after background subtraction , we corrected the measured count - rates as is appropriate for the @xmath1871% live - time during the 5.7ms readout cycle of the pn - ccd @xcite .",
    "[ fig : lc ] displays the resulting lightcurve .",
    "we display the psd and the @xmath2 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] ( the frequency range is @xmath19hz to @xmath20hz with 57 independent frequencies , the period range is 20005000s with 132 test periods ) . a peak at a period of @xmath184200s ( corresponding to a frequency of @xmath21hz ) that is consistent with the period claimed by @xcite is seen . in order to determine the significance of the peaks seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] , we computed significance levels using the methods outlined in section  [ sec : qpo ] .    before we can perform these simulations , we need to determine the shape of the psd . for this purpose , we apply the `` response method '' of @xcite and @xcite , where a model power spectrum generated through the combination of a large number of red noise simulated lightcurves is compared to the observed power spectrum .",
    "varying the slope and normalization of the model periodogram , the best @xmath4 fit gives a slope of @xmath22 , and a normalization determined by the variance of the original xmm lightcurve ( @xmath4/dof = 17.89/55 ) .",
    "this low value indicates that the observed psd is fully consistent with a power law and that no additional components , such as a qpo , are required .",
    "we note , however , that the short duration of the observation only allows for a poor determination of the psd shape .",
    "methods complementary to testing the consistency of the psd with a power law should be used .",
    "we therefore simulated the desired 5000 lightcurves from a @xmath23-psd , with 29000s of duration using a sampling interval of 100s , a mean count rate @xmath24 , a lightcurve variance @xmath25 .",
    "examples of such simulated red - noise lightcurves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_plots ] .    to obtain the `` local significance '' of the peak at @xmath184200s , we calculated @xmath2 and the psd of each of the 5000 monte carlo realizations .",
    "for each trial period , we then computed the distribution of the @xmath2 and psd values at this trial period from all realizations .",
    "these distributions were used to determine the 99% , 95% , and 68% `` local significance '' levels using the method described in section  [ sec : qpo ] .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] .",
    "the peak at @xmath184200s claimed as qpo by @xcite is below the 95% significance curve .",
    "we also applied the `` global significance '' test to the mrk  766 lightcurve for the period range from 2000s to 5000s .",
    "[ fig : rel_sig ] shows the probability distribution of @xmath26 , which corresponds to the probability of finding a red - noise lightcurve with a normalized maximum peak value less than or equal to the corresponding @xmath26 value . for mrk  766 ,",
    "the putative qpo peak lies at the 45% mark .",
    "in other words , @xmath1850% of the simulated red - noise lightcurves show peaks that are more significant than the peak observed in mrk  766 .",
    "we conclude that the observed 4200s `` qpo '' in mrk  766 may be an artifact of the red - noise process and not the result of a physical process .    as we mentioned above",
    ", the value of @xmath27 determined from the observations is rather uncertain .",
    "however , our result is independent of the specific value of @xmath27 : simulations with @xmath27 values ranging from 1 to  2 , i.e. , over the typical @xmath27 range seen in agn , yielded similar results .",
    "in this _ letter _ we have described two methods to determine the significance of possible quasi - periodic signals in the red - noise lightcurves observed from active galactic nuclei using monte carlo simulations ; a frequency - dependent `` local significance '' test and a `` global significance '' test . reiterating arguments by @xcite",
    ", we showed that `` phase randomization '' techniques should not be used for the generation of simulations since the resulting lightcurves do not exhibit true red - noise characteristics .",
    "the periodograms of lightcurves produced by this method do not obey the @xmath4 statistics which results from a random process , overestimating therefore the significance of peaks present in the periodogram of an underlying red - noise lightcurve . instead of `` phase randomization ''",
    "we recommend the algorithm of @xcite to simulate red - noise lightcurves with the correct statistical properties .",
    "the `` local significance '' test based on red - noise power simulations generated with the @xcite algorithm shows that the 4200s feature in mrk  766 is not significant at the 95% level .",
    "this statement holds for both , psd and @xmath2 analysis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] ) .",
    "the `` global significance '' of the 4200s feature is 45% , i.e. , higher peaks in the 20005000s period range are found in roughly half of all simulated lightcurves .",
    "thus , the presence of a peak in a red - noise @xmath2 or psd is far from unusual .",
    "we are therefore led to the conclusion that we can not confirm the claim of a @xmath184200s qpo .",
    "rather , we attribute the peak at 4200s to a random occurrence which is due to the red - noise character of agn data .",
