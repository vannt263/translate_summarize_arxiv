    "kaon photoproduction on the nucleon provides an important tool for understanding the dynamics of hyperon - nucleon systems .",
    "accurate information on the elementary amplitude is vital for calculating the cross sections of the hypernuclear photoproduction , since the amplitude serves as the basic input , which determines the accuracy of predictions @xcite . at present , these calculations can be compared with high resolution spectroscopy data of the hypernuclei , which are available from the experiments performed at the jefferson laboratory @xcite .",
    "since the hypernucleus production cross section is sensitive to the elementary amplitude , especially at forward kaon angles , a precise description of the elementary process at this kinematics is obviously desired .",
    "the two sets of ample , good quality , experimental data provided recently by the clas ( cl05 ) @xcite and saphir ( sp03 ) @xcite collaborations were expected to help us learn more about the process ; however , they reveal a lack of consistency at forward and backward kaon angles @xcite ( see also ref .",

    "@xcite ( hereafter referred to as old ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the experimental information causes a wide range of model predictions at forward kaon angles .",

    "@xcite ) are compared with predictions of different phenomenological models . obviously , the data and the models , which were fitted to various data sets , differ significantly for @xmath3 , which leads to a large input uncertainty in the hypernuclear calculations @xcite .    at present , there are two large data sets , the latest clas and saphir ones , with comparable statistical significance , but they diverge in some kinematic regions .",
    "measurements of the differential cross sections at small kaon angles from leps @xcite provide another good quality data set for energies from 1.5 to 2.4 gev .",
    "these data are consistent with the clas but not the saphir data .",
    "the older data , sp98 and old , are scarce ; and for @xmath4 , they also reveal some discrepancies , as shown by open squares @xcite and open circles @xcite in fig.[crs_comp ] .",
    "this situation clearly indicates that before a reliable determination of the parameters of a model for the elementary process can be performed , we have to decide which data sets are consistent with each other and which can thus be used in fitting the models .",
    "the purpose of this work is to analyze the mutual consistency and similarities of the data sets by using selected isobaric models .",
    "the analysis will enable a better determination of the elementary amplitude , especially at forward angles .",

    "although there are some kinematics overlaps of the considered data sets , an interpolation by using an analytical formula is still necessary to perform a direct comparison . to avoid this we compare the observed cross sections with predictions of theoretical models . for this purpose , we calculate the relative deviation for each data point as done in the analysis of old data  @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the measured value and its statistical uncertainty , respectively , at the kinematics given by the photon laboratory energy @xmath8 and the kaon center of mass angle @xmath9 .",
    "the theoretical value @xmath10 is calculated within a particular isobaric model at the appropriate kinematic point .",

    "the statistical uncertainties of the cross sections were used in the analysis and in the fits of the new models ( see the next subsection ) .",

    "because of the absence of a dominant resonance , as in the case of pion and @xmath38 photoproductions , various nucleon and hyperon resonances are considered , which results in a copious number of models @xcite .",
    "hadrons were supposed to be pointlike particles in the strong vertices in some models @xcite but , in the newest ones @xcite , the hadron structure is considered by means of hadronic form factors . the effective coupling constants in the models were determined by fitting the appropriate observables to experimental data .    in our analysis , the saclay - lyon ( sl ) @xcite and kaon - maid ( km ) @xcite models were adopted .",
    "common to these models is that , besides the extended born diagrams , they also include kaon resonances @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that these @xmath41-channel resonant terms together with the nucleon ( @xmath42-channel ) and hyperon ( @xmath43-channel ) resonances can improve the agreement with the experimental data in the intermediate energy region .",
    "the models differ in the choice of the particular @xmath42- and @xmath43-channel resonances in the intermediate state , in the treatment of the hadron structure , and in the set of experimental data to which the free parameters were adjusted .",
    "however , the two main coupling constants , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , fulfill the limits of 20% broken su(3 ) symmetry @xcite in both models .    in the sl model , four hyperon and three nucleon resonances with the spin up to 5/2 are included and their coupling constants were fitted to the old data set @xcite and the first results of saphir by bockhorst _",

    "the latter is known as the `` missing '' resonance , a resonance predicted by the quark model but not yet listed in the particle data book @xcite .",

    "the background part of the amplitude is improved by assuming the @xmath43-channel resonances as suggested by janssen _",
    "particularly , @xmath50 and @xmath51 hyperon states were chosen in fit 1 , as they give the best agreement with the data .",
    "the hadron structure in the strong vertices is modeled by the dipole - type form factors introduced by a certain gauge - invariant technique @xcite .",
    "the cutoff parameters in the form factors of the born and resonant contributions are independent . the free parameters of fit 1 , i.e. the coupling constants and cutoffs , were determined by fitting the differential cross sections to all clas data in the energy region of @xmath52 gev ( see the definition of sample a in section  [ analysis ] ) .",
    "the model fit 1 exhibits a strong suppression of the cross sections at small kaon angles for @xmath53  gev as discussed above in connection with h.f.f .",
    "this pattern , being connected with a strong suppression of the born terms , particularly the electric part of the proton exchange , causes large deviations of the model predictions from the data at small angles , which precludes analysis of the data at forward angles . to have a more realistic description of the forward - angle data we assume also a model , fit 2 .",
    "the resonance content of fit 2 was motivated by the sl model , which shows a better agreement with the data in the forward hemisphere than the km model , especially for energies @xmath46  gev ( @xmath54  gev , see the next section ) .",

    "the presence of the hyperon @xmath51 resonance , which was also included in the sl model , appears to be irrelevant in the forward - angle region . on the other hand",

    "we have analyzed the old ( pre-1972 ) and new ( clas 2005 , saphir 2003 , and leps ) experimental data by comparing them with several existing isobaric models , along with two new models fitted to the clas data .",
    "special attention was given to the forward - angles data , i.e. data with @xmath101 .",
    "the phenomenon of the cross section suppression at forward angles for the isobaric models with the hadronic form factors was observed .    at forward angles , the clas 2005 , leps , and pre-1972 data",
    "can be described reasonably well within the isobaric model without hadronic form factors .",
    "the saphir 2003 data are systematically shifted below the model predictions which requires a global scaling factor of 15% to remove the discrepancy .",
    "the model without hadronic form factors , however , can not describe the data in the backward hemisphere and at energies @xmath54  gev .",
    "the isobaric models with hadronic form factors were shown to give too strong damping of the cross sections at small kaon angles and energies @xmath102  gev , which results in a disagreement with existing experimental data . in their present forms ,",
    "these models are therefore not suited for the description of photoproduction in this kinematic region , which is important , e.g. , in the calculation of hypernuclear photoproduction .",
    "needless to say , more precise experimental data at very small kaon c.m . angles ( @xmath103 ) would help solve this problem .",
    "the saclay - lyon and kaon - maid models do not describe the data satisfactorily as indicated by the statistics @xmath71 for testing hypotheses .",
    "the former model is more consistent with the pre-1972 and leps data sets than with the clas 2005 and saphir 2003 ones . at forward angles",
    ", the saclay - lyon model agrees quite well with the clas data .",
    "the kaon - maid model provides a better description of the clas 2005 , leps , and pre-1972 data than the saphir 2003 ones .",
    "the relative - global - scaling factor between the saphir and clas data is estimated to be 1.13 , which is in agreement with the given systematic uncertainties .",
    "this discrepancy was shown to affect the parameters of the `` missing '' resonance @xmath2 in the kaon - maid model .",
    "the extracted values of the mass and width of the resonance differ by 11 and 337 mev , respectively , when the saphir and clas data are individually used in fitting the parameters .",
    "this finding agrees with the conclusion of a similar analysis that used the multipoles approach  @xcite .",
