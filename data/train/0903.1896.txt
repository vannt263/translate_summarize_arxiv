    "the formation of highly relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is one of the unsolved fundamental problems in astrophysics ( e.g. meier et al .",
    "it has been assumed that jets are produced close to the central black hole , involving power extraction from the black hole spin ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; macdonald & thorne 1982 ; thorne & blandford 1982 ) and/or from the accretion disk ( blandford & payne 1982 ) .",
    "although the jet formation remains unclear , the estimate of the jet power is of fundamental physical interest , since it can be used to quantify the power emerging from the central engine of the radio source .",
    "recently , the prescriptions for agn feedback have been introduced into semi - analytic models of galaxy formation , and both bower et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that this feedback is able to solve the issue of the bright end of the luminosity function , whilst simultaneously solving other problems of galaxy formation models such as why the most massive galaxies are so red .",
    "although the form of the agn feedback adopted is very different in the two prescriptions , the relativistic ejecta from the agn is a conceivably important ingredient of agn feedback .",
    "indeed , in clusters of galaxies containing powerful radio sources , x - ray observations have revealed bubbles and cavities in the hot intracluster medium , evacuated by the expanding radio source ( e.g. mcnamara et al . 2000 ; fabian et al .",
    "recent studies showed that the mechanical luminosity of radio sources are sufficient to suppress cluster cooling flows ( best et al .",
    "2006 ; nusser , silk & babul 2006 ) . to understand the interaction between the radio sources and the surrounding medium , it is clearly important to estimate the bulk kinetic power of radio jets , since the expanding radio sources provides a direct way for the agn output to be coupled to its environment",
    ".    the relation between the jets and the accretion processes in active galactic nuclei has been extensively explored by many authors and in different ways .",
    "the strong correlations have been found between the low - frequency radio and narrow - line luminosities of 3c radio sources ( baum & heckman 1989 ; rawlings et al .",
    "1989 ; saunders et al .",
    "1989 ) , and also between the broad line and extended radio luminosity for radio - loud quasars ( e.g. cao & jiang 2001 ) .",
    "the link between the jets and the accretion processes can also been studied through exploring the relationship between luminosity in line emission and kinetic power of jets in different scales ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ; celotti & fabian 1993 ; falcke , malkan & biermann 1995 ; wang , luo & ho 2004 ) .",
    "rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) used the narrow - line luminosity as indicative of the accretion power and estimated the power transported by the jet from the energy content and lifetime of the radio lobes , finding a good correlation between the two . using radio data on very long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) scales and the standard synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) theory ,",
    "celotti & fabian ( 1993 ) estimated the jet kinetic power to put constraints on the matter content of jets .",
    "it offers some clues to understand the fundamental questions of the mechanisms , such as the collimation and acceleration of jets .",
    "celotti , padovani & ghisellini ( 1997 , hereafter c97 ) explored the relation of luminosity in broad emission lines with the kinetic power of the jets for a sample of radio - loud agns .",
    "their estimate of the bulk kinetic power is based on the adoption of the ssc model applied to the radio vlbi data and x - ray ( or optical ) fluxes .",
    "lacking more accurate information , the minimum @xmath0 for any given @xmath3 [ i.e. @xmath4 is used in the derivation of bulk kinetic power for objects with @xmath5 , otherwise the @xmath0 is derived from an average @xmath3 .",
    "they found a suggestive hint of correlation between these two luminosities which is in favour of a link between the accretion process and the jets .",
    "however , by re - estimating the luminosity in broad emission lines on the sample of c97 , wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argued that the jet bulk kinetic power is significantly correlated with the disk luminosity .",
    "maraschi & tavecchio ( 2003 , hereafter mt03 ) found that the jet power is linearly proportional to the disk power for a sample of blazars , for which the jet powers were estimated using physical parameters determined from uniformly modeling their spectral energy distributions .",
    "however , by studying a sample of quasars from wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , punsly & tingay ( 2005 ) argued that the bulk kinetic power and the bolometric luminosity are very weakly correlated in radio - loud quasars that possess blazar cores . in the framework of the relativistic beaming and the ssc model , the physical quantities in the jets",
    "can be estimated using the vlbi observations and the x - ray flux density .",
    "marscher ( 1987 ) derived the beaming parameters on the assumption of homogeneous spherical emission plasma .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) adopted marscher s approach and obtained the doppler boosting factor @xmath6 for 105 sources .",
    "moreover , readhead ( 1994 ) estimated the equipartition doppler boosting factor @xmath7 , assuming that the sources are in equipartition between the energy of radiating particles and the magnetic field .",
    "gijosa and daly ( 1996 ) derived the @xmath8 for the same sample in ghisellini et al .",
    "the variability doppler factor @xmath9 is derived on the assumption that the associated variability brightness temperature of total radio flux density flares are caused by the relativistic jets ( lhteenmki & valtaoja 1999 ) .",
    "the advantage of homogeneous sphere model is that the formalism is simple and the value of @xmath6 derived is independent on the cosmology model .",
    "however , it is generally difficult to know the component angular size and the flux at the turnover frequency , so one has to assume that the vlbi observing frequency is the synchrotron self - absorption frequency .",
    "in addition , the dependence of core size on the observing frequency in some sources is inconsistent with the homogeneous spherical assumption .",
    "blandford and knigl ( 1979 ) and knigl ( 1981 ) presented an inhomogeneous relativistic jet model , in which both the flat spectrum characteristics of some agns and the dependence of the core size on the observing frequency could be well explained . based on their model",
    ", a new approach has been proposed to derive the jet parameters including bulk lorentz factor @xmath0 , viewing angle @xmath1 and electron number density @xmath2 in the jets ( jiang , cao & hong 1998 , hereafter j98 ) .",
    "the proper motion measurements on the jets components were adopted in their calculations .",
    "the correlation between the brightness temperature in the source rest frame and the derived doppler factor suggested that the derived values of beaming parameters are quite reliable ( j98 ) .",
    "moreover , the derived beaming parameters from the homogeneous sphere model is in general consistent with that from their inhomogeneous jet model .    in this work ,",
    "we follow the method of j98 to derive the physical quantities of jets for a large sample of agns , then re - analyze the relation between the luminosity in broad line emissions and the bulk kinetic power of the jets . in section 2 , we describe the sample of sources .",
    "the method of jet parameters derivation and the estimate of jet kinetic power are outlined in section 3 .",
    "section 4 includes the results and discussion . in the last section ,",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "the cosmology with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 have been adopted throughout the paper .",
    "in order to use inhomogeneous jet model to estimate the jet parameters , all sources should have vlbi measurements of proper motion of outflowing plasma . combining with the relevant data of sources , such as the radio flux density , the size of the core and x - ray flux density ,",
    "the jet parameters can be derived ( j98 ) . after searching the literature ,",
    "our sample is constructed , which consists of 128 sources , including 94 quasars , 26 bl lac objects and 8 radio galaxies .",
    "the observational data for the sample are presented in table 1 : ( 1 ) iau name ; ( 2 ) classification of the source ( q= quasars ; qc= core - dominated quasars ; ql= lobe - dominated quasars ; qp= ghz peaked quasars ; bl= bl lac objects ; g= radio galaxies ) ; ( 3 ) redshift z ; ( 4 ) observation frequency @xmath13 in ghz ; ( 5 ) core radio flux density @xmath14 at frequency @xmath13 ; ( 6 ) vlbi core size @xmath15 in mas ; ( 7 ) reference for the vlbi data ; ( 8) the proper motion @xmath16 ; ( 9 ) reference for the proper motion ; ( 10 ) 1 kev x - ray flux density @xmath17 in @xmath18jy ; ( 11 ) reference for the x - ray flux .",
    "when there are more than one moving components , we adopted the fastest one , which is regarded as a good approximation of jet bulk motion .",
    "in addition , we use the core flux density measured at the highest frequency , when vlbi core was measured at more than one frequency .",
    "we assume that all the observed x - ray flux density is attributable to the ssc emission in the derivation , which will introduce some uncertainties",
    ". however , the derived jet parameters are not sensitive to the adopted x - ray flux density ( j98 ) .",
    "the redshift of 0716 + 714 is not available , and a value of 0.3 is assumed in the calculation . to calculate the total luminosity of broad emission lines ,",
    "the available measurements of various broad emission lines for each source are collected from literatures .",
    "moreover , we search the literatures and collect all available radio extended emission data from vla observations for each source .",
    "the data are available for all 128 sources , of which the data from australia telescope compact array ( atca ) are used for the southern source 0208 - 512 , and only upper limit is available for 8 sources due to the faintness or non - detection of extended emission .",
    "the extended flux density is k - corrected to 5 ghz in the rest frame of the source assuming @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we estimate the bulk kinetic power based on the inhomogeneous jet model ( knigl 1981 ) . using vlbi radio data , including proper motion of plasma , and x - ray fluxes",

    ", the jet parameters were calculated by relating the model predicted size of optically think region in the jet , radio emission from the optically think region along the jet , ssc x - ray emission from the unresolved jet , and the apparent transverse velocity to the observables of radio core size , radio core flux density , x - ray flux density , and the proper motion . in this paper , we assume that the x - rays are from the jet rather than the intracluster gas and the radio blob speed is the jet flow speed .    in knigl s inhomogeneous jet model , the magnetic field @xmath21 and the number density of the relativistic electrons @xmath22 in the jet are assumed to vary with the distance from the apex of the jet @xmath23 as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , where @xmath26 pc and @xmath27 is the lorentz factor of the electron in the jet .",
    "given that the bulk motion velocity of the jet is @xmath28 ( corresponding to a lorentz factor @xmath0 ) with an opening half - angle @xmath29 , and the axis of the jet makes an angle @xmath30 with the direction of the observer , the distance from the origin of the jet , @xmath31 , at which the optical depth to the synchrotron self - absorption at the observing frequency @xmath32 equals unity , is given as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the constant in the synchrotron absorption coefficient , @xmath3 is the doppler factor , and @xmath35 /(2\\alpha+5)$ ] .",
    "the projection of the optically thick region in the jet is then used as the observed vlbi core angular size @xmath15 ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the angular diameter distance of the source .    by integrating the emission from the optically thick region along the jet",
    ", the radio flux of the core can be obtained    @xmath38    where @xmath32 is the vlbi observing frequency , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the constants in the synchrotron emission and absorption coefficients , respectively .    equation ( 13 ) in knigl s work gives the x - ray flux density estimation from an unresolved jet . as in j98",

    "the proper motion observed with vlbi can be converted to the apparent transverse velocity @xmath44 , which is related to the bulk velocity of the jet @xmath28 and viewing angle @xmath45 ,    @xmath46    given the three parameters @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and the relation between the opening half angle @xmath29 and the lorentz factor @xmath0 , the parameters of an inhomogeneous jet can be derived from vlbi and x - ray observations , using the above equations and equation ( 13 ) in knigl ( 1981 ) . in our calculation , we take @xmath49 , the opening half - angle @xmath50 , and assume @xmath51 , @xmath52 corresponding to a free jet ( hutter & mufson 1986 ) . with the estimated comoving total electron number density @xmath53 , lorentz factor @xmath0 and the cross section of the jet @xmath54 , the bulk kinetic power is then derived as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the electron rest mass , @xmath57 is the rest mass of positive charge , @xmath58 is the average lorentz factor of electrons , and @xmath59 is the average lorentz factor of positive charges . for a conical jet with an opening half - angle @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",

    "@xmath66 is largely dependent of the matter content of jets and the low energy cut - off @xmath67 of electrons . in present , the jet composition is still unclear , i.e. whether electron - positron or electron - proton ( see worrall & birkinshaw 2006 , for a recent review and reference therein ) .",
    "however , for an electron - proton plasma , @xmath68 has been suggested , while @xmath67 could be as low as unity for an electron - positron jet ( e.g. celotti & fabian 1993 ) .",
    "the detection of circular polarization strongly suggests that the jets are electron - positron plasmas with @xmath69 at least in some sources ( e.g. wardle et al .",
    "the similar conclusion is also arrived from powerful large scale x - ray jets , if they are interpreted as inverse - compton scattering of cosmological microwave background photons in fast jets . from equation ( 8) , however , we find that the bulk kinetic power @xmath70 for a electron - proton jet with @xmath71 ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) is in agreement with that of electron - positron one with @xmath69 ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) within a factor of three .",

    "the observational data necessary for calculations are presented in table 1 .",

    "the reason of no measurements for remaining 30 sources could be either the non - detection of broad emission lines in 11 bl lac objects and 6 radio galaxies , or no published line flux measurements for 13 quasars . we have calculated the total luminosity of broad emission lines for these 98 sources .",
    "the relationship between @xmath78 and @xmath66 is shown in fig .",
    "1 . we find a strong correlation between these two luminosities with a spearman correlation coefficient of @xmath82 at @xmath83 confidence .",
    "it should be noted that this correlation may be caused by the common dependence on redshift .",
    "we present the bulk kinetic power and blr luminosity as functions of redshift @xmath84 for the sample in fig .",
    "we therefore use the partial spearman rank correlation method ( macklin 1982 ) to check this correlation .",
    "still , a significant correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.323 is present at about @xmath85 significance level between @xmath78 and @xmath66 , independent of the redshift .",

    "1 ) . therefore",
    ", we conclude that this correlation might be intrinsic , at least for our present sample . assuming that the blr luminosity is due to the reprocessing of the ionizing radiation from the accretion disk",
    ", it therefore strongly supports the scenario of a tight connection between the relativistic jet and the accretion process .    for all 98 sources , the ordinary least - squares ( ols ) bisector method gives the following fit in fig . 1 : @xmath87 apart from finding a significant correlation",
    ", rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) found that the relationship between the bulk kinetic power and narrow line luminosity is close to proportionality , @xmath88 , which extends over four orders of magnitude .",
    "our relation of @xmath89 is consistent with the relationship between the jet power and narrow - line luminosity in rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) and celotti & fabian ( 1993 ) , whereas it is somehow deviated , but not much , from the linear relation between the jet power and disk power found by mt03 .",
    "however , it is much steeper than that of wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , @xmath90 .",
    "although what cause these differences is unclear , we note that the methods used to estimate the jet power in mt03 and wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) are different from ours .",
    "the jet powers of mt03 were estimated using physical parameters determined from uniformly modeling their spectral energy distributions , while wang et al . ( 2004 ) directly used the jet bulk kinetic power from c97 , which was estimated using the homogeneous sphere ssc model .",
    "moreover , mt03 obtained their disk luminosities either directly from the optical - uv luminosity of the big blue bump or from the original prescription of c97 .",
    "the method wang et al .",
    "used to estimate @xmath78 is basically same as ours .",
    "in addition , wang et al .",
    "sample consists of 35 blazars , and only 16 sources ( 11 quasars and 5 bl lac objects ) were considered in mt03 .",
    "their samples are much smaller than our sample . whether these factors influence",
    "the dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath78 needs further investigations . despite this",
    ", our results strongly support the scenario that the accretion process are tightly linked with the kinetic power in the jet , though how the disk and jet are coupled is not revealed by present correlation analysis .    in general , bl lac objects , which is thought to be fr",
    "i radio galaxies pointing at us , are characterized by very weak or absent emission lines , invisible blue bumps , and relatively powerful jets . from fig .",
    "1 , it is clear that bl lac objects have fainter broad - line luminosity compared to quasars , though only 15 bl lac objects are in our sample . we find that the @xmath91 relation of bl lac objects deviate from that of quasars , although it generally follows that of the whole sample . the linear fit using ols bisector method for bl lac objects shows @xmath92 while for quasars , we have @xmath93 although the mechanism of jet formation is unclear , the different dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath78 in bl lac objects and quasars can be due to the difference of the accretion power as measured in units of the eddington one .",
    "compared to quasars , bl lac objects are characterized by radiatively inefficient accretion disks ( cao 2003 ) , thus in these sources the jet power may be relatively dominant . to further check the @xmath91 correlation in fig .",
    "1 , we re - examine it for quasars only .",
    "when bl lac objects and radio galaxies are excluded , we still find a strong correlation between @xmath78 and @xmath66 with correlation coefficient of @xmath94 at @xmath95 confidence .",
    "this further confirms the tight link between the accretion process and the kinetic power in the jet .",
    "if the accretion process and the jet formation are indeed closely related , then the tight relation between the mass channelled into jets and that accreted by black hole would be expected .",
    "we then investigate the relationship between the mass outflowing rate and accretion one , on assumption of @xmath96 ( netzer 1990 ) , and with the expression of the kinetic and the accretion powers as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the mass outflowing rate , @xmath0 is jet lorentz factor , @xmath99 is the mass accretion rate , and @xmath100 is the efficiency of mass to energy conversion for accretion . adopting the typical value of @xmath101 , we find a significant correlation between @xmath98 and @xmath99 for whole sample , with a spearman correlation coefficient 0.514 at @xmath83 confidence .",
    "this implies that the mass outflowing rate in jet is closely linked with the accretion one in accretion disk .",
    "the present analysis is based on the derivation of jet parameters using inhomogeneous jet model . some parameters and assumptions",
    "are adopted in the inhomogeneous jet model to derive the physical quantities of the jet ( j98 ) , which may induce some uncertainties in the estimation of @xmath66 .",
    "the most important is probably the intrinsic differences of the low energy cut - off @xmath67 of electrons between the radio sources themselves . in this work ,",
    "we adopt the same value of @xmath67 in deriving the kinetic power of the jet , which may not be true .",
    "however , we are not able to estimate @xmath67 for each source at present stage .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the adoption of an uniform @xmath67 for all sources in the correlation analysis would not affect the main conclusion drawn here .",
    "moreover , our results are based on the assumption of @xmath49 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , and we adopted these same values for all sources in our model calculation . however , we find that the alternative adoption of @xmath102 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 do not change our main conclusion , e.g. the strong correlation between @xmath66 and @xmath78 . in practice ,",
    "the sources may have different values of parameters @xmath43 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , and , in principle , these parameters could be constrained by the observable quantities ( j98 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the information is only found for a few cases through multi - frequencies vlbi observations .",
    "further high resolution multi - frequencies vlbi observations would be helpful to improve our model calculations .",
    "it should be noted that not all sources in our sample have available blr luminosity .",
    "therefore , the selection effects may be introduced in our correlation analysis , i.e. those sources without published broad line flux measurements may likely be biased towards those with weak lines , especially the 11 bl lac objects without broad line flux measurements . to evaluate the selection effects",
    ", we tentatively calculate the upper limit of blr luminosity assuming equivalent width of broad @xmath103 line @xmath104 for these 11 bl lacs .",
    "moreover , we calculate the blr luminosity for 13 quasar without blr luminosity by randomly assigning the blr flux in the blr flux range of 81 quasars with blr luminosity . combining these 24 sources with those having blr luminosity",
    ", we use the astronomy survival analysis ( asurv ) package ( isobe , feigelson & nelson 1986 ) to investigate the correlation by taking the upper limit into account . a significant correlation is still found with spearman s rho correlation method .",
    "this correlation is confirmed by using the partial correlation method for censored data of akritas & siebert ( 1996 ) to exclude the common dependence of redshift .",
    "furthermore , the correlation remains significant even we conservatively adopt broad @xmath103 line @xmath105 for 11 bl lacs .",
    "it thus seems that the non - blr luminosity sources do not affect our correlation results .      in fig .",
    "3 , the relation between bulk kinetic power and 5 ghz radio extended luminosity is shown for all 128 sources . since only the upper limit of 5 ghz extended luminosity",
    "is given for 8 sources , we use asurv package ( isobe et al .",
    "1986 ) to investigate the correlation and perform the linear regression analysis for our censored data .",
    "we find the significant correlation with a spearman s rho correlation coefficient of @xmath106 at @xmath83 confidence .",
    "using the partial correlation method for censored data of akritas & siebert ( 1996 ) to exclude the common dependence of redshift , a significant correlation is still present between @xmath107 and @xmath66 .",
    "we use the schmitt - binning method ( schmitt 1985 ) to perform @xmath108 and @xmath109 fits and then calculate a bisector of these two fits , as described in shapley , fabbiano & eskridge ( 2001 ) ( see also isobe et al . 1990 ) .",
    "we obtain : @xmath110 which is shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "the extended radio flux is usually emerged from the optically thin radio lobes , and thus is free from the doppler boosting effects , since the lobe material is generally thought to be of low enough bulk velocity .",
    "therefore , the extended radio luminosity can be a good tracer of jet power ( e.g. cao & jiang 2001 ) .",
    "the significant correlation between @xmath66 and @xmath107 implies that the emission from radio lobes are tightly related with the energy ejected into the jet from the central parts of agns .",
    "this result is not surprising , as it could be naturally expected .",
    "although the detailed mechanism of jet formation is still unclear , the energy can be transported through the jets to the radio lobes once the jets are generated .",
    "most of the energy flux of jets is not radiated away , instead are in mechanical form ( i.e. bulk kinetic power ) , of which the particles and fields are necessary to produce the synchrotron luminosity that is detected in the radio lobes .",
    "if the radiative efficiency of radio lobes are similar between our radio sources , then the tight link between the bulk kinetic power of jets and the radio extended emission is expected , since the latter is optically thin and not effected from the doppler enhancement .",
    "motivated largely by the observed effects of radio - loud agn on their environments at galaxy cluster scales ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "2003 ) , whether the heating effect of agn activity , particularly radio - loud agn activity , can balance the cooling of the gas has recently arose much interest ( e.g. best et al . 2005 , 2006 ; croton et al . 2006 ; nusser , silk & babul 2006 ) .",
    "independently of the radio properties , b@xmath111rzan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) estimated the mechanical luminosity associated with the radio source , by studying the cavities and bubbles that are produced in clusters and groups of galaxies due to the interactions between the radio sources and the surrounding hot gas .",
    "the dependence of the mechanical luminosity on the 1.4 ghz radio luminosity of the associated radio sources , @xmath112 fitted for their entire sample , is somewhat deviated from ours ( equation 13 ) .",
    "however , the dependence for the radio - filled cavities only ( see b@xmath113rzan et al .",
    "2004 for details ) , @xmath114 is marginally consistent with ours within the errors . despite this , we note that their work is mainly based on the galaxy clusters and the radio sources in these clusters , however , our present study focused on the powerful radio sources .",
    "moreover , the jet power is estimated using different methods , and the different radio luminosity is used . in present",
    ", we are not able to draw a solid calibration between the radio emission and the kinetic power of jets , and it needs further investigations . despite the strong correlation presented in fig .",
    "3 , the significant scatter is clearly seen .",
    "this is not surprising since even for a source of fixed jet kinetic power the radio luminosity changes as the source ages ( e.g. kaiser et al .",
    "however , there are several factors that can introduce the scatter into the correlation .",
    "we note that the observed radio extended emission has been dissipated over a long period , which is not contemporaneous with the estimated bulk kinetic power .",
    "moreover , when jets transported the energy flux from the central parts of agns to outer radio lobes , the jets can be decelerated by the interaction with the nuclear ism and/or the entrainment of external gas ( e.g. tavecchio et al .",
    "2006 ) . as a result",
    ", the part of jet power will be lost to the ism . in some extreme cases , the kinetic power of the jet on kiloparsec scales could be about three orders of magnitude weaker than the power of the jet on 10 - 100 pc scales due to the jet - ism interaction , i.e. virtually all of the jet power can be lost to the ism within the inner kiloparsec ( gallimore et al .",
    "consequently , the difference of jet - ism interactions between the radio themselves may bring scatter .",
    "furthermore , part of the scatter may be due to the different radiative efficiency in individual source .",
    "it is well known that the monochromatic radio luminosity does not provide a good indicator of the mechanical energy output of a radio source .",
    "radio sources are inefficient radiators .",
    "bicknell ( 1995 ) estimated that the kinetic energy output of a radio jet is typically a factor of 100 - 1000 higher than the total radio luminosity of a radio source , which is recently confirmed by the observations of b@xmath111rzan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "we estimate the amount of radiative dissipation on parsec scales , i.e. the ratio of @xmath115 of the bulk kinetic power to the intrinsic radiative luminosity . the latter has been computed from the observed vlbi radio core fluxes . the doppler correction on the monochromatic luminosity",
    "is assumed to be @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the observed and intrinsic ( comoving ) luminosities .",
    "we can calculate @xmath119 from the dependence of the core radio flux on the doppler factor from equation ( 3 ) , in which @xmath119 is dependent of the value of @xmath102 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in fig .",
    "4 , we show the histogram of the derived ratios @xmath115 .",
    "we find that the ratio covers about three orders of magnitude with the average value @xmath120 .",
    "this result is consistent with that of celotti & fabian ( 1993 ) , although a wider spread of ratio distribution in their sources .",
    "the results indicate that for all sources the kinetic power is dominant with respect to the radiative output , and consequently that the radiative dissipation is not an efficient process .",
    "moreover , the large variation in this ratio indicates that the radio luminosity is not necessarily a reliable probe of the available bulk kinetic power .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the synchrotron emission of blazars can extend to optical and even x - ray region , which can dominate over the thermal emission from accretion disk , and the radio emission as well .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is usually composed of two peaks , of which the first one is dedicated to the synchrotron emission for jets , and the second is due to the inverse compton process ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ; ghisellini et al . 1998 ) .",
    "thus the total radiative luminosity of the jets , if we can estimate from integrating over the synchrotron domain of sed , can represent the minimum power that must be associated with the jet in order to produce the observed luminosity . in this sense , the radio emission solely might not be a good indicator of the radiative output from the radio jets , i.e. the radiation losses of the kinematic jet flow .",
    "mt03 found that the radiative efficiency , i.e. the ratio of the total radiative luminosity of the jet to the jet power , can be in the range 1%-10% .",
    "even so , the radiative dissipation is still not an efficient process , and the most of the energy flux is in the kinetic form . in present",
    ", it is not readily to estimate the total radiative luminosity of jets for our sample .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the inefficient radiators of radio sources would be still retained .",
    "based on the inhomogeneous jet model , we have calculated the jet parameters for a sample of agns .",
    "the bulk kinetic power of radio jets are then estimated using the derived jet parameters .",
    "we found a significant correlation between the bulk kinetic power of the relativistic jet and the total luminosity in broad emission lines , implying a tight link between the jet and accretion process .",
    "moreover , the bulk kinetic power of jets are strongly correlated with the radio extended luminosity .",
    "this indicates a closely connection between the emission from radio lobes and the energy flux transported through jets from the central parts of agns .",
    "in addition , we found that the bulk kinetic power is dominant with respect to the radiative output , which means the radiative dissipation is not an efficient process .",
