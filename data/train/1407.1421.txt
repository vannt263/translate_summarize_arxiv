    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are formed as the result of the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) . in the most simple scenario of the formation of pne",
    ", the star evolves to the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase developing a dusty , slow , and dense wind that interacts with the interstellar medium ( ism ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after the star evolves off the agb phase towards hotter effective temperatures , the post - agb star develops a high ultraviolet flux that photoionizes the agb material .",
    "this phase is also characterized by a fast wind that is able to sweep up , shock , and compress the photoionized agb envelope @xcite .",
    "the first report of the detection of x - ray emission associated with a pn was made by @xcite using observations from the _ exosat _ satellite . since",
    "then a great number of pne have been observed to harbor x - ray emission . a comprehensive review of the pne reported with the _ old _ x - ray facilities ( _ einstein _ , _ exosat _ , _ rosat _ , and _ asca _ ) was presented by @xcite . given the capabilities of those satellites , it was not possible to unambiguously disentangle the photospheric emission from the central star ( cspn ) from that of the nebular diffuse emission .",
    "with the unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatories this problem can finally be resolved . by 2009 , diffuse x - ray emission delimited by bright optical bubbles had been reported for ten pne ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported that of the 35 pne observed to that time with _",
    "chandra _ , @xmath2% display diffuse x - ray emission . in all positive detections ,",
    "the x - ray emission comes from a hot bubble inside an optical shell .",
    "the nature of the diffuse x - ray emission from hot bubbles in pne is still a matter of discussion .",
    "the main problem is that in the wind - wind interaction scenario the shocked plasma would possess temperatures of @xmath3  k as expected from an adiabatic shocked wind with terminal velocities of @xmath4  km  s@xmath5 and plasma densities @xmath610@xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "measured central star wind velocities using p cygni profiles of uv lines indicate that cspn wind velocities are generally above 1000  km  s@xmath5 and can be as high as 4000  km  s@xmath5 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , the x - ray observations suggest plasma temperatures of @xmath9  k and electron densities of 110@xmath10  @xmath8 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the boltzmann constant , the mean particle mass , and hydrogen mass , respectively . ] . it should be noted that the same temperature and density discrepancy is found in hot plasmas detected towards hii regions and wolf - rayet(wr ) bubbles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied the hot bubbles produced in 2d radiation - hydrodynamic simulations of the formation and evolution of aspherical planetary nebulae .",
    "this pioneering work showed that the interface between the hot bubble and the swept - up shell of agb material is unstable , but unfortunately the numerical resolution of these simulations was not high enough to fully develop the instabilities .",
    "these papers also estimated the soft x - ray emission predicted by the simulations and found that it came from the thin interface between the hot bubble and the surrounding photoionized material where numerical diffusion spreads the temperature and density jumps across 4 or 5 computational cells .",
    "more recent numerical models have studied different aspects of the formation of hot bubbles inside pne and their associated x - ray emission .",
    "the influence of the central star stellar wind parameters during the post - agb phase was studied in purely hydrodynamical , one - dimensional models by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they concluded that in this phase the fast wind velocity must be below 10@xmath14  km  s@xmath5 in order to explain such low temperatures in the x - ray - emitting plasma , however , this is not consistent with the results from the observed p cygni profiles of uv lines of central star winds . a different explanation for the diffuse emission was put forward in an analytical approach proposed by @xcite .",
    "one difficulty in these works is that they do not take into account the time evolution of the stellar wind properties ( velocity and mass - loss rate ) and the star s ionizing photon rate .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the evolution of the stellar wind parameters of the central star and the evolution of the x - ray emission from the hot bubble was presented by the potsdam group in @xcite .",
    "they started their 1d study of the evolution of pne with a parameter study ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which they included a large set of initial models from the agb phase to hot white dwarf ( wd ) using post - agb stellar evolution models from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they used three different numerical approaches to the agb wind evolution : a fixed density profile @xmath15 , a kinematical approach , and a hydrodynamic calculation .",
    "in the two latter cases the agb density and velocity profiles depend directly on the evolutionary track used . specifically , they found that for the hydrodynamical approach , the dependence of the density profile @xmath16 might vary depending on the initial mass from @xmath17 to r@xmath18 with an even steeper gradient ( @xmath19 ) farther from the central star .",
    "the transition phase between the agb and wd phase was developed using the reimers formulation @xcite , but they concluded that the dynamical impact of this short - lived phase is rather small .",
    "one of their conclusions is that pne formed from massive central stars will never become optically thin in the high - luminosity phase unless a low - density agb envelope is developed .    in @xcite ,",
    "one - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamic models were used to study the effect of classical and saturated thermal conduction on the soft x - ray emission from pne .",
    "the _ chianti _",
    "software was used to generate synthetic spectra and study the time variation of the luminosities and surface brightness profiles .",
    "they concluded that thermal conduction must be taken into account in order to reproduce the observed x - ray luminosities in closed inner cavities in pne . since thermal conduction",
    "is suppressed perpendicular to the magnetic field direction , this implies that magnetic fields in pne must be absent or weak ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these results are consistent both with wind velocities greater than 1000  km  s@xmath5 and with the observed soft x - ray emission in pne having temperatures of a few times @xmath20  k. however , the low x - ray temperatures are only obtained if thermal conduction is included  models without conduction fail to reproduce the observations .",
    "an interesting scenario has been presented by @xcite in which the soft x - ray - emitting gas can be explained as the result of the interaction of a jet with a spherical agb wind .",
    "this model does not take into account the evolution of the central star in any phase nor the ionizing photon flux in the post - agb phase .",
    "the extended soft x - ray emission predicted by this model comes from an expanding bubble of adiabatically cooling shocked jet material , where the jet velocities can lie between @xmath21 and 3000  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the source of the jet is a collimated wind from a binary companion .",
    "this is the first of a series of papers in which we will study the formation , characteristics and evolution of hot bubbles in pne and their associated soft x - ray emission .",
    "our main goal in the present paper is to use 2d axisymmetric numerical simulations to study the formation of the hydrodynamical and ionization instabilities created in the wind - wind interaction between the fast wind and the previously ejected agb slow wind , and the rle played by these instabilities in reducing the temperature at the edge of the diffuse hot bubble .",
    "the importance of these instabilities has been downplayed by other authors in earlier one - dimensional numerical treatments of this problem @xcite .",
    "we find that the instabilities result in density inhomogeneities that become enhanced and can form dense clumps in the region of the contact discontinuity between the shocked fast wind and the swept - up agb material .",
    "secondary shocks , photoevaporation flows and photoionization shadows are some of the phenomena associated with the interaction of the fast wind and the ionizing photon flux with these clumps , with consequences both for the hot bubble and for the external photoionized shell . we argue that this highly dynamic mixing region will be an important source of diffuse soft x - ray emission in pne .",
    "we compare the characteristics of models with different initial masses , as more massive stars evolve faster .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in   [ sec : num - method ] we describe the numerical method and the physics included in the simulations and in   [ sec : stellar - evolution ] we present the stellar evolution histories and the stellar wind parameters and ionizing photon rates used as input to the models .",
    "our results are presented in   [ sec : results ] and the hot bubble properties and evolution for the cases with and without thermal conduction are discussed in   [ sec : discussion ] . in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize and draw conclusions .",
    "the radiation - hydrodynamics numerical scheme used in this work is similar to that used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main difference between that scheme and the one used in this paper is the way in which the stellar wind is injected into the computational domain .",
    "first , the agb wind is modelled in 1d spherical symmetry .",
    "this is a slow , dense wind expanding at subsonic velocities into the surrounding medium , which results in a @xmath22 density distribution bounded by a thin , dense shell , located at @xmath62  pc as the result of the interaction with the ism .",
    "this shell will not be relevant for the pn formation ( see figure  10 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "variations in the agb wind parameters during this stage due to thermal pulses can produce internal density structure superimposed on the general @xmath22 distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : density_1d ] ) .",
    "we do not consider the proper motion of the star during this stage , which could lead to anisotropy in the circumstellar medium ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) prior to the onset of the fast wind .    at the end of the agb stage ,",
    "the 1d spherically symmetric results are remapped onto a 2d axisymmetric @xmath23 grid to continue the evolution through the pn stage , where the effective temperature of the central star increases , resulting in a two - orders of magnitude increase in the stellar wind velocity and the onset of an ionizing photon flux .",
    "the combined effects of the fast wind  agb - wind interaction , the density gradient , and the ionizing photon flux lead to the formation of structures at the contact discontinuity due to rayleigh - taylor , thin - shell and shadowing instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . these phenomena",
    "can not be modelled in 1d spherical symmetry .",
    "the dense clumps formed as a result of these instabilities are ablated and photoevaporated by their interaction with the shocked fast wind and the ionizing photon flux .",
    "this leads to a complex scenario in which the densities and temperatures of the material at the edge of the hot , shocked wind bubble do not mark a sharp transition as in the 1d case . in our models ,",
    "the large surface area presented by these structures formed at the contact discontinuity enhances the evaporation of material from the dense , cold clumps into the hot , tenuous bubble .      in 1d",
    "spherical symmetry , the appropriate eulerian conservation equations are @xmath24 where @xmath25 $ ] is the vector of conserved quantities , @xmath26 $ ] is the vector of fluxes and @xmath27 $ ] is the vector of source terms , both physical and geometrical .",

    "the neutral hydrogen density is advected through the computational domain according to the equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the hi fraction .",
    "the hydrodynamic conservation equations are solved using a second - order , finite volume , godunov - type scheme with outflow - only boundary conditions at the outer boundary . at every time step , the density , momentum and energy in an inner spherical region are reset with a free - flowing stellar wind , whose parameters are interpolated from a table according to the current time values derived from stellar evolution models .",
    "the hydrogen ionizing photon rate,@xmath38 , is also interpolated from these tables and the transfer of ionizing radiation is performed by the method of short characteristics @xcite in spherical symmetry .",
    "this method consists of finding the column density of neutral hydrogen at each point in the grid and thus the optical depth to each point from the ionizing source .",
    "a single frequency of ionizing radiation is assumed in these calculations .",
    "the time - dependent hydrogen ionization balance equation takes into account both photoionization and collisional ionization together with recombination : @xmath39 where @xmath37 and @xmath40 are the neutral and ionized hydrogren fractions and @xmath41 is the electron density .",
    "the collisional ionization rate of neutral hydrogen , @xmath42 , and the radiative recombination rate of ionized hydrogen , @xmath43 , are functions of temperature only and are obtained from analytic fits . the photoionization rate in each cell , @xmath44 ,",
    "is calculated using the radiation transport procedure .",
    "the ionization update is performed after the main hydrodynamic evolution step using operator splitting .",
    "the hydrodynamic and ionization equations are coupled through the pressure term in the momentum and energy equations ( since the gas pressure depends on the total number of particles , i.e. , ions , neutrals and electrons ) , and also through the heating and cooling source terms in the energy equation .",
    "the hydrogen ionization balance equation ( eq .  4 ) is solved and other elements are assumed to be in ionization equilibrium at the temperature and radiation conditions for each computational cell . although this procedure is not as accurate as taking into account the fully time - dependent ionization of the most important ions @xcite , it has the benefit of being computationally efficient and is easily extended to two ( or more ) dimensions .",
    "the radiative cooling term @xmath34 takes into account abundances appropriate to pne , via the cloudy pn abundance set ( * ? ? ?",

    "we again solve the time - dependent hydrogen ionization equation ( eq .  [ eq : hionization ] ) and employ the 2d advection equation to describe the transport of the neutral hydrogen fraction through the computational domain .",
    "we use the same radiative cooling source term and again limit the cooling in a cell whose cooling is more than double that of its neighbours in an effort to avoid spurious cooling due to numerical diffusion in the vicinity of contact discontinuities .",
    "we optionally include thermal conduction through the axisymmetric diffusion equation ( eq .  [ eq : diffuse ] ) , which is again solved by appropriate numerical techniques through operator splitting after the main hydrodynamic and radiation transport steps .      for the 1d spherically symmetric calculations ,",

    "the computer code automatically detects when the outer edge of the expanding agb wind has become close to the outer boundary and incrementally extends the computational grid with more cells at the original initial conditions of density and temperature whenever necessary .",
    "this procedure avoids large computational domains at the beginning of the simulation and also means that the final size depends on the particular stellar evolution model being calculated without needing to compromise the initial resolution .",
    "the 2d axisymmetric calculations are performed on a fixed grid of 1000 radial by 2000 @xmath65-direction cells of uniform cell size and total grid spatial extent @xmath71  pc@xmath72 .",

    "the use of a fixed - size grid has the disadvantage that , for the lowest initial stellar mass models , the outer photoionized shell leaves the computational domain at late times .",
    "however , since we are primarily interested in the formation of hot bubbles and their potential for emitting soft x - rays , we have decided to focus on the region @xmath73  pc .",

    "an improvement between our stellar parameters and those from previous numerical studies is that we do not model the ionizing photon flux as black body radiation . with the use of wm - basic we obtained realistic spectra at different evolution times of the star and we integrated them to compute the ionizing photon rate .",

    "we first describe the results without thermal conduction , and then discuss the main features of the inclusion of this physical effect .",

    "we present a series of images for each model , corresponding to the inner hot shocked wind bubble having mean radius 0.05 , 0.1 and 0.2  pc for group a models , and for the group b models we show results corresponding to the maximum radius of the hot , shocked bubble , since in these cases the hot bubble stalls before it reaches 0.2  pc and then begins to collapse . in order to highlight the main features of each group , we show figures for representative models in the main text , and figures for the other models are collected in appendix  [ app : appa ] . for group a , the representatives are 1.5 - 0.597  @xmath76 and 2.5 - 0.677  @xmath76 ( see figs .

    "models 1.0 - 0.569 , 1.5 - 0.597 , 2.0 - 0.633 , and 2.5 - 0.677 evolve in very similar ways due to the similarity of the initial circumstellar medium density distribution and velocity at the start of the post - agb phase ( see fig .",

    ", the opacity in the ring of clumps drops as they expand outwards , and the whole outer region becomes photoionized and more homogeneous .",
    "the continued acceleration of the fast stellar wind means that the swept - up shell is accelerated down the density gradient and rayleigh - taylor instabilities become important at the contact discontinuity between the low density , shocked fast wind material and the dense , swept - up shell .",
    "this leads to the formation of elongated , dense , partially ionized structures pointing inwards into the hot bubble .",
    "neutral , dense material inside these filaments can be photoevaporated by the ionizing flux .",
    "the expanding , photoevaporated gas flows away from the head of the neutral filament , towards the central star .",
    "it then interacts dynamically with the radially outflowing , shocked fast wind , giving rise to pockets of @xmath80  k gas with densities in the range @xmath81  @xmath8 .",
    "the hot bubble , on the other hand , has temperature @xmath82  k and density @xmath83  @xmath8 .",
    "even when there is no neutral material inside the dense filaments to generate photoevaporated flows , the diversion of the shocked fast wind material around the dense obstacles leads to hydrodynamic ablation and the mixing of cooler , dense material into the faster , hot flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in general , the models that evolve more slowly generate longer filamentary structures , simply because they have had a much longer time to grow by the time the hot bubble has expanded to 0.2  pc radius .",
    "the 2.5 - 0.677 case is particularly interesting .",
    "the ring of clumps forms due to the thin - shell instability as for the other cases in this group .",
    "however , the faster acceleration of the stellar wind and the resulting higher pressure in the hot bubble mean that the clumps are pushed out to about 0.1  pc before the photoionization has the opportunity to cause this shell of swept - up material to expand . the clumps are therefore denser in this model at this radius than for other models",
    ". the ionizing photon rate of the central star now drops sharply and so the dense clump material recombines .",
    "this leads to the situation where the heads of the now neutral clumps develop ionization fronts and photoevaporation flows pointing towards the central star .",
    "initially , the pressure of the hot bubble is higher than the pressure in the photoionized material , and the photoevaporated material is pushed back into the shell .",
    "as the whole structure expands slowly outwards , however , and the mass - loss rate of the central star drops sharply , the pressure in the photoevaporated flows becomes greater than that in the hot bubble and starts to expand away from the neutral clumps , back towards the central star after passing through a termination shock .",
    "this leads to the situation in the final row of figure  [ fig : pn25_2d ] , where the hot bubble is surrounded by a thick shell of photoionized material , within which are embedded neutral clumps .",
    "the thick shell is slowly moving outwards , broadening as it goes , and the hot bubble is confined by the slowly decreasing pressure of the photoionized gas .",

    "models from group  b are the result of the evolution of the most massive stars of our sample .",
    "the density distribution around these stars at the end of the agb stage does not have such a steep radial dependence .",
    "this means that the fast wind expands into a denser medium and the swept - up shell of agb material is correspondingly denser .",
    "in fact , the ionization front becomes trapped in the shell and does not manage to break out and hence the surrounding medium remains neutral throughout the evolution .",
    "the photoionized shell has a high thermal pressure and effectively confines the hot bubble to small radii .",
    "this effect is enhanced by the sharp cspn mass - loss rate fall off ( see fig .",

    "the evaporation process results in a sheath of comparatively dense ( @xmath84  @xmath8 ) , but hot ( @xmath85  k ) material around the fingers and clumps that were formed by the different instabilities at the interface between the hot bubble and dense swept - up shell .",
    "the total surface area of the conducting layer is very large because of these instabilities and substantial amounts of agb shell material are evaporated into the hot bubble .",
    "we find that the pressure in the hot bubble is higher in the models with conduction and so the expansion for all models is more rapid than for the models without conduction .",
    "this is because the evaporated material expands into the interclump region between the clumps and filaments in the broken shell and the bubble does not depressurize . at a given time , the instabilities are much more developed for the models with conduction than those without .",
    "the swept - up photoionized shells in the models with conduction are thinner because the hot bubble dominates the dynamics .",
    "the higher pressure means that these pne are essentially wind - blown bubbles surrounded by thin swept - up shells .",

    "the scalar shows how far the evaporated dense shell material has penetrated into the hot bubble .",
    "we begin with an explanation of the 1d results .",
    "the classical description of a stellar wind bubble divides it into distinct regions ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "closest to the star , there is an inner region of unshocked , free - flowing stellar wind , which is separated from the hot bubble by an inward - facing shock .",
    "the hot bubble comprises hot , shocked stellar wind material and is separated by a contact discontinuity from the swept - up shell .",
    "this shell is composed of swept - up ambient medium , which for our models is agb material .",
    "there can be a photoionized region inside the swept - up shell , in which case there will be an ionization front preceded by a shock in the neutral medium within the shell .",
    "external to the shell is undisturbed ambient medium . for a steady stellar wind",
    ", the pressure between the inner stellar wind shock and the outer neutral shock will be uniform .",
    "the contact discontinuity between the hot , shocked stellar wind and the swept - up , photoionized shell separates diffuse gas at @xmath87  k from dense gas at @xmath88  k. if magnetic fields are not important at this interface , conduction due to thermal electrons from the hot gas can lead to diffusion of heat across the contact discontinuity ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : diffuse ] ) . for the hot , diffuse gas",
    ", the heat diffusion leads to a loss of thermal energy and hence a reduction of temperature in this gas together with a corresponding increase in density , since the pressure remains constant . for the cooler , dense gas",
    ", there is an increase in temperature .",
    "depending on the details of the radiative cooling , the stellar wind , and the ionizing photon rate , one of the following must occur :    1 .",
    "the cooling timescale for the heated dense material is so short that it cools immediately back to its original state .",
    "we remark that this case is also likely to occur if there is over - cooling at the contact discontinuity as a result of numerical diffusion .",
    "2 .   the heated dense gas expands at constant pressure , where the pressure is dictated by conditions in the hot shocked wind bubble .",
    "the increase in volume ( and corresponding decrease in density ) in this gas pushes the shell outwards .",
    "3 .   the heated dense gas can not expand outwards and instead pushes inwards , increasing the pressure inside the hot , shocked bubble and pushing the inner stellar - wind shock closer to the star .",
    "this occurs particularly if the stellar wind mechanical energy is decreasing rapidly with time .",
    "whichever of these 3 behaviours prevails initially , radiative cooling will play an important rle on the timescale of a cooling time .",
    "cooling times are shortest in the heated dense region .",
    "as this gas begins to cool , its volume decreases ( since the pressure must remain constant because this gas is located between the hot , shocked bubble and the surrounding photoionized region ) . due to the short evolution timescales of these planetary nebula models , cooling is not necessarily complete on the timescale of the simulations .",
    "we see evidence for a cooling region in the 1.5 - 0.597 1d model results ( see fig .",
    "cooling in the reduced temperature diffuse gas occurs on much longer timescales ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : compare1d2d ] shows examples of the second and third types of situations listed above .",
    "for example , the 1.5 - 0.597 models are examples of the second case , where in the models with conduction , the heated , dense gas expands and pushes the dense shell outwards , in comparison with the models without conduction . in these models ,",
    "the ambient medium gas is photoionized beyond the swept - up shell .",
    "the 3.5 - 0.754 models , on the other hand , are examples of the third case , where the heated dense gas expands quite a long way back towards the star , pushing the inner stellar wind shock to smaller radii in the models with conduction , in comparison with the models without conduction . in these models ,",
    "the swept - up shell of ambient medium gas is mainly neutral , since the ionizing photon rate falls off rapidly within the first 1000  yrs of the planetary nebula evolution .",
    "the scalar in these figures indicates the position of the interface between the wind material and the ambient material .",
    "the 2.5 - 0.677 models are more complicated , since the swept - up shell contains the ionization front and preceding neutral shock and is mainly , though not completely , photoionized .",
    "the photoionized gas regulates the pressure throughout the planetary nebula once the stellar wind mechanical luminosity begins to decline .",
    "we now examine the differences between the 2d and 1d simulations .",
    "for the 1.5 - 0.597 case without conduction we immediately notice that the inner stellar wind shock for the angle - averaged 2d results is at a larger radius than for the equivalent 1d models .",
    "this means that the density , and hence the pressure in the hot , shocked wind bubble is lower in the 2d case , since the post - shock temperature is the same in all cases because it depends only on the stellar wind velocity .",
    "the reason for the lower pressure can be appreciated by looking at figure  [ fig : pn15_2d ] . the swept - up shell in this figure",
    "has broken up due to instabilities and the hot wind can find its way through the gaps , depressurising the hot bubble .",
    "although the peak density occurs at roughly the same radius as in the 1d models , warm ( @xmath89  k ) gas extends beyond the shell as a result of mass pick - up from the clumps and filaments by the hot wind as it flows through the gaps in the leaky bubble . for the 1.5 - 0.597 2d model with conduction ,",
    "the inner stellar wind shock coincides more - or - less with the 1d results .",
    "this is because conduction heats the gas at the surface of the cold , dense filaments and the expansion of this gas seals the gaps in the bubble .",
    "the result is a broad , roughly uniform density shell with a temperature of a few times @xmath90  k.    the averaged locations of the interface between hot bubble and swept - up shell in 2.5 - 0.677 2d models with and without conduction correspond roughly to their 1d counterparts .",
    "however , the average density as a function of radius within the hot bubble is an order of magnitude higher in both cases .",
    "this is a result of hydrodynamical mixing of dense material into the hot diffuse gas at the irregular interface .",
    "non - radial motions thoroughly mix the ablated , cool , dense gas throughout the hot bubble , thereby raising the average density and lowering the average temperature .",
    "this is in contrast to the 1d conduction results , where the temperature in the hot bubble is reduced solely as a result of heat loss due to diffusion of heat , with no corresponding diffusion of material .",
    "the averaged 2d models have lower density , broader , swept - up shells than the 1d models , and opacity variations in these shells between the clump and interclump gas mean than photons can leak through into the surrounding ambient medium . in the 1d cases , the photoionized region remains trapped in the swept - up shell .",
    "the results for the 3.5 - 0.754 2d model without conduction are similar to their 1d counterpart .",
    "the average density inside the hot bubble is dominated by the long , dense filament that can be seen in figure  [ fig : pn35_2d ] extending inwards from the interface .",
    "the swept - up shell is far broader and has a much lower density than in the 1d models and is partially ionized . in the 2d model with conduction ,",
    "the interface is extremely distorted ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pn35_2d_cond ] ) and this makes it difficult to identify in the averaged density and temperature plots .",
    "the clumps and filaments formed by the instabilities at the interface between the hot , shocked fast wind and the dense , photoionized shell are sources of mass for the hot bubble .",
    "hydrodynamic ablation and photoevaporation remove material from the dense structures , which then shocks against and mixes into the hot shocked wind @xcite .",
    "the mass of hot gas ( where we consider @xmath91  k to be `` hot '' ) is thus not solely due to the mass lost by the post - agb star .",
    "thermal conduction can also enhance the mass of gas in the hot bubble by directly evaporating photoionized shell material at the interface .",
    "the increased surface area due to the corrugations in the interface facilitates the mixing processes .    to illustrate this , we compute the mass of hot gas in the bubble as a function of time for the 1.5 - 0.597 and 2.0 - 0.633 models ( the other cases are similar ) for the first 8000  yr of the pne .",
    "figure  [ fig : masa_tiempo ] shows the total mass injected by the post - agb wind , obtained by integrating the mass - loss rates shown in figure  [ fig : wind_parameters ] and the actual mass of hot gas in the numerical simulation for both models and for the simulations with and without thermal conduction .",
    "it is clear that the hot bubble becomes dominated by mixed - in mass even in the 2d simulations without conduction .",
    "for the 1.5 - 0.597 model , this occurs after 5500  yrs when there is no conduction , and almost from the outset in the model with conduction .",
    "for the 2.0 - 0.633 model , the mixed - in mass dominates after 2500  yrs in the case without conduction .",
    "in contrast , the 1d model for the 1.5 - 0.597 case without conduction shows that the hot bubble mass is always less massive than the total injected wind mass , which is what one would expect for the case with no mixing .",
    "the hot bubble mass for our 1d model for the 1.5 - 0.597 case with conduction shows similar behaviour to the comparable model of steffen et al ( 2008 ) , although a direct comparison is not possible due to the different stellar wind properties adopted in the two models .",
    "our 2d models show that for the times when the hot bubble has reached a radius of 0.2  pc , even the cases without thermal conduction are dominated by mixed - in mass .",
    "when thermal conduction is included , there is an order of magnitude more mixed - in mass in the hot bubble .",
    "the increase in the mass of hot gas in the pne in these 2d simulations as compared to our 1d models ( see also the 1d simulations of @xcite ) suggests that detection in soft x - rays is likely even when thermal conduction is not present .",
    "we address this issue in a forthcoming paper ( paper ii , toal & arthur in preparation ) .",
    "the radial velocity of the photoionized shell is of observational and theoretical interest @xcite since it provides a link between observable properties of the pn and the evolution of the central star .",
    "the photoionized shell kinematics depends on the initial density distribution left by the agb star , the stellar wind mechanical energy and the stellar ionizing photon luminosity .",
    "our simulations are focussed on the formation of the hot bubble ( see  2.3 ) , and our spatial domain extends only to 0.5  pc radius from the star . as a result , at late times",
    "we lose information about the outer shell that results from the ionization front and its interaction with the outer rim of the agb material . however , we can study the expansion velocity of the dense shell created in the fast wind - agb - wind interaction .",
    "this dense shell , or w - shell ( see * ? ? ? * ) , is created by the expansion of the hot shocked wind into the photoionized agb material .",
    "since the fast wind - agb - wind interaction provokes the instabilities , we include them as part of the w - shell for the velocity calculation .",
    "we define the velocity as the density - weighted mean radial velocity of the photoionized gas in the w - shell by @xmath92 where the integrals are performed over all photoionized gas with a ionized number density in excess of 200  @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : velocity_ionized ] shows the w - shell velocity as a function of time for the 1.5 - 0.597 and 2.0 - 0.633 models with and without thermal conduction .",
    "all models show a steady increase of the w - shell velocity with time , which is consistent with previous numerical results by @xcite .",
    "observational results @xcite suggest that the nebular shells decelerate as the central star luminosity decreases , however , we do not find this from our 2d models .",
    "our models with thermal conduction have , in general , faster expansion rates , since the pressure in the hot bubble is higher in these models than in those without conduction .",
    "we do not calculate the nebular expansion for the 3.5 - 0.754 and 5.0 - 0.90 models as these would not be observationally detected since they are ionization bounded and enshrouded by dense neutral material .",
    "the results presented in  [ sec : results ] illustrate the formation of hot bubbles for different initial - mass stellar - evolution models .",
    "instabilities corrugate the interface between the hot bubble and the surrounding dense shell and lead to the formation of filaments and clumps .",
    "the properties of these clumps depend on the interplay between the initial agb density profile and the time - dependence of the stellar wind and ionizing photon rate in the post - agb phase .",
    "the stellar wind velocity increases steadily with time for cspn masses @xmath93 ) , and so the temperature of the hot , shocked stellar wind increases during the pn lifetime . in the case of the 1.0 - 0.569  @xmath76 model , the velocity increases extremely slowly , and the temperature in the hot bubble is only @xmath94  k even after 5000  yrs of pn evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity increase in the 2.0 - 0.633  @xmath76 model is much more rapid , and after 5000  yrs , the hot shocked wind temperature is @xmath95  k. for the most massive star models ( 3.5 - 0.754 and 5.0 - 0.90 ) , the velocity almost instantaneously increases to @xmath96  km  s@xmath5 but after only @xmath97  yrs the mechanical energy of post - agb wind decays dramatically and the bubble starts to collapse .",
    "rayleigh - taylor instabilities are important at the contact discontinuity between the hot bubble and the dense shell , due to the continued acceleration of the stellar wind , together with expansion in a radially decreasing density distribution .",
    "the swept - up agb material also cools rapidly and forms a thin , dense shell which is unstable to thin shell instabilities @xcite .",
    "once dense clumps have begun to form , the shadowing instability @xcite comes into play due to the variations in opacity , and the density contrasts between clump and interclump regions can become even more enhanced . if the density becomes high enough , the clumps become opaque to photoionizing radiation and the gas within them can recombine .",
    "we speculate that neutral clumps such as those formed in our 2.5 - 0.677 simulations could be precursors of molecular clumps observed in pne such as ngc6053 and ngc6720 @xcite .",
    "however , in the present simulations our treatment of the neutral gas is not sufficiently detailed to follow the formation of molecules and dust .",
    "another important factor in the formation of the clumps and filaments is the cooling curve used ( see fig  [ fig : cooling ] ) , which for photoionized regions depends on the abundances in the gas and on the ionization parameter ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "our cooling curve was calibrated using the cloudy photoionization code for standard pn abundances ( see table  [ tab : abundances_cloudy ] ) , mean stellar effective temperature @xmath99  k , gas density @xmath100  @xmath8 and ionizing photon flux @xmath101  cm@xmath7s@xmath5 .",
    "there are differences between results obtained using this cooling curve and cooling curves for different abundance sets and ionization parameters .    as an illustration , in figure  [ fig : cooling_discussion ]",
    "we compare the total ionized number density resulting from a simulation for a 1.0 - 0.569 model without thermal conduction using our usual pn cooling curve with that of a simulation using a cooling curve calibrated for a cooler star ( @xmath102  kk ) with standard ism abundances taken from cloudy ( see table  [ tab : abundances_cloudy ] ) , gas density 1  @xmath8 and ionizing photon flux @xmath103  cm@xmath7s@xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cooling]thin - solid line ) .",
    "the appearance of the interface is very different : there are fewer clumps and the instability appears to be more a pure rayleigh - taylor type .",
    "the density of the clumps at the interface is not large enough to trap the ionizing photons and so the region beyond the swept - up shell is completely photoionized .",
    "the differences due to the adopted cooling curves are most important in the temperature range @xmath104 . cooling below 10@xmath105  k depends on stellar parameters such as effective temperature and ionizing photon rate , while cooling above 10@xmath105  k is independent of these factors , since the hot gas is collisionally ionized , although the metallicity remains an important ingredient ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the cooling curve used in the present simulation is a clear improvement over the standard ism cie cooling curve typically used in hydrodynamical simulations because it uses a more appropiate abundance set and takes into account the ionizing photon flux from the central star , but tailoring the stallar parameters , ionization parameter , and abundance set at each time would be more accurate .",

    "the inclusion of thermal conduction leads to evaporation of material at the interface , which fills in the interclump region in the broken shell and reseals the bubble .",
    "this results in higher pressures in the conduction models than in those without conduction . indeed , the expansion of the models without thermal conduction is dominated by the pressure of the thick shell of photoionized gas around the hot bubble , while the models with thermal conduction are more similar to wind - blown bubbles , surrounded by thin shells of swept - up photoionized material .",

    "we limit our comparison to those works that have taken into account a detailed treatment of the evolution of the stellar wind parameters and show the formation of hot bubbles , principally those studies presented by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we adopt the same agb wind parameters as @xcite , i.e. , those calculated by @xcite and so do not expect large departures from their results .",
    "indeed , the density profiles we arrive at at the end of the tp - agb stage are very similar , particularly the innermost 0.5  pc , which is of most interest to us .",

    "for the post - agb evolution , we use the same stellar evolution models as @xcite .",
    "however , we calculate the stellar wind mass loss and terminal velocity using the wm - basic code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and subsequent papers . ) .",
    "we also obtained the ionizing photon flux from wm - basic instead of using a black body .",
    "our stellar wind parameters differ from those of @xcite , who use the empirical fits of @xcite to the data compiled by @xcite .",
    "the resulting mass - loss rates are in the same range of values with very similar temporal dependence . on the other hand ,",

    "@xcite and @xcite use different evolutionary models for the post - agb stage @xcite .",
    "moreover , for stellar effective temperatures below 25  kk they use the @xcite prescription for the stellar wind mass - loss rate .",
    "their stellar wind properties are therefore not quite the same as those used in this paper  our mass - loss rates are slightly higher and our wind terminal velocity is slightly lower  but the differences are not significant since the stellar wind mechanical luminosity @xmath111 is the important quantity . once again",
    ", a black body spectrum is used to calculate the ionizing photon rate .",
    "the minor differences in the stellar wind parameters and ionizing photon rate between our models and previously published work are dynamically not that important .",
    "the duration of the transition from the agb to the white dwarf stage is the main indicator of whether the planetary nebula will be density bounded ( as seen for the models with initial mass @xmath112 ) or ionization bounded ( as seen for the 3.5 - 0.754 and 5.0 - 0.90 models ) .",
    "our results agree broadly with those of @xcite and @xcite in this regard but the fact that our simulations are 2d allows the possibility that the shell of agb material swept up by the fast wind in the early stages of the pn evolution breaks up due to instabilities . for the lower initial stellar mass models",
    ", this creates regions of higher opacity ( clumps ) that may even recombine and become neutral condensations embedded in a surrounding photoionized flow , and regions of lower opacity through which the ionizing photons may pass to photoionize the material beyond the shell .",
    "the formation of these clumps starts with the thin shell instability and depends on the metallicity of the gas and on the form of the cooling curve .",

    "* ) , in contrast to @xcite who use the strmgren approximation .",
    "unlike @xcite , we find that in our 2d models the thermal conduction does have a dynamical effect on the planetary nebula system .",
    "for the lower mass cspn ( @xmath113 ) , models without conduction have leaky bubbles , whereas thermal conduction reseals the gaps between the clumps and filaments in the broken shell .",
    "the gas between the clumps and filaments is material which has been evaporated from the filaments and has expanded as it is heated .",
    "the hot bubble in these models grows much more quickly , reaching our `` target '' distance of 0.2  pc much sooner than in the models without conduction , since there is no loss of pressure , and the interclump material has temperatures @xmath114  k. the interclump material in the models without conduction , on the other hand , is hot gas with @xmath115  k escaping from the bubble .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare1d2d ] shows that for the higher mass models , the positions of the inner and outer shock waves and the interface between the hot bubble and swept - up shell for models both with and without conduction for the 2d simulations averaged over angle coincide reasonably well with their 1d counterparts .",
    "however , in the 2d cases , a substantial amount of dense shell material is shed from the clumps and filaments by hydrodynamic interaction , photoevaporation and thermal evaporation and is thoroughly mixed throughout the hot bubble by non - radial motions . at later times ,",
    "once the dynamical time has become as large as the cooling time , cooling will become important inside the hot bubble .",
    "this will occur much earlier in the 2d simulations than in the 1d simulations because the density is much higher in the former .    while cooling is still unimportant , the effect of thermal conduction is to raise the temperature in the cool , dense gas at the interface with the hot bubble . in both 1d and 2d simulations , the heated gas expands and pushes the swept - up shell outwards .",
    "this is particularly the case with the higher - mass cspn models @xmath116 ) .",
    "these models have larger hot bubbles than their counterparts without conduction , although they still remain enshrouded by neutral material and would not be detectable .",
    "our 2.5 - 0.677 model shows intermediate behaviour . the simulation without conduction",
    "has `` leaky bubble '' characteristics , while the simulation with conduction mixes quite a lot of dense shell material back into the bubble . in these models , the clumps in the broken shell recombine and photoevaporated material flows off the heads of these clumps back towards the star .",
    "the effect of thermal conduction on the dynamics is also evident in figure  [ fig : velocity_ionized ] , where we show the w - shell ( dense shell formed by the fast wind - agb wind interaction ) velocity as a function of time for two of our lower mass cspn models , 1.5 - 0.597 and 2.0 - 0.633 .",
    "for these models , the simulations without conduction are of the `` leaky bubble '' type , where hot , shocked gas pushes its way between the clumps and filaments of the broken shell . the reduced pressure in the hot bubble results in lower expansion velocities for the external photoionized shell .",
    "the corresponding models with conduction remain pressurised , since the gaps in the shell are sealed by material evaporated from the filaments .",
    "the expansion velocities in the surrounding photoionized shell are correspondingly higher .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed 2d axisymmetric radiation - hydrodynamics simulations of the formation of aspherical planetary nebulae through an interacting winds model .",
    "their models took into account the density distribution of the circumstellar agb stage material and although @xcite considers constant fast wind parameters , @xcite takes into account the time evolution of the post - agb wind and ionizing photons .",
    "unfortunately , the resolution of these simulations is very low ( 80x80 computational cells at best ) , and although the formation of instabilities at the interface between the hot shocked fast wind and the swept - up photoionized agb material is hinted at , the numerical resolution is simply not adequate to follow their development .",
    "@xcite estimate the soft x - ray emission from their models and find it to come from a thin layer just inside the photoionized shell .",
    "however , this is an artefact due to numerical diffusion at the contact discontinuity and the low resolution of the simulations converts it into an appreciably amount of soft x - ray emission .",
    "other 2d , purely hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite show the formation of instabilities at the contact discontinuity , but these remain confined to a thin layer and do not grow . in our simulations ,",
    "the resolution is much higher and the instabilities can be characterised and are well developed .",
    "moreover , the strong radiative cooling and the proper treatment of the radiative transfer in our models mean that once the instabilities form they become enhanced and grow in size so that the surface area they present becomes quite large .",
    "we only follow the evolution of our models up until the hot bubble has achieved a radius of @xmath117  pc . for the 1.0 - 0.569",
    ", 1.5 - 0.597 , and 2.0 - 0.633 models this occurs before the mass - loss rate and ionizing photon luminosity have dropped off completely and so it can be expected that these hot bubbles will expand further .",
    "the 2.5 - 0.677 model reaches 0.2  pc only very slowly , since the mass - loss rate and ionizing photon luminosity decline sharply after 3000  yrs and it is the residual pressure of the hot bubble that is driving the expansion against the diminishing pressure of the expanding photoionized shell .",
    "our most massive star models , 3.5 - 0.754 and 5.0 - 0.90 , have such a fast evolution that the hot bubble reaches a maximum radius before the pressure in the hot shocked gas falls below the pressure of the surrounding photoionized shell and the hot bubble collapses back towards the star .",
    "this is a natural way of explaining the back - filling of gas in pne , such as is seen in the helix nebula .",
    "finally , we speculate that in the case of 3d simulations the instabilities in the wind - wind interaction zone would develop faster than the formation of clumps in 2d simulations ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this was explored in numerical simulations for the analogous case of the formation of ( hot bubbles in ) wr nebulae by @xcite .",
    "they found that 3d simulations show more structure than 2d simulations , although the differences are relatively small . in 3d , there will be a larger surface area of dense agb material available to be hydrodynamically ablated or evaporated and we therefore expect that the mixing of material into the hot bubble would be even more effective than in the present 2d results .",
    "in this paper we have presented high - resolution 2d radiation - hydrodynamic numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of hot bubbles in planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "we considered six different stellar evolution models with initial masses of 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3.5 , and @xmath118 at solar metallicity ( @xmath75 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which correspond to final wd masses of 0.569 , 0.597 , 0.633 , 0.677 , 0.754 , and 0.90  @xmath74 .",
    "the initial circumstellar conditions are obtained from 1d simulations of the final few thermal pulses of the agb phase and are the same as those used in @xcite , but in the case of the post - agb phase the stellar wind velocity , mass - loss rate , and ionizing photon rate are computed self - consistenly using the wm - basic stellar atmosphere code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . from our results",
    "we find that :    * the formation and evolution of hot bubbles in pne depend on different factors : the density distribution of the previously ejected agb material , the time - evolution of the stellar wind parameters in the post - agb phase , and the metallicity and cooling rate used in the calculations .",
    "differences between models create different patterns of instabilities in the wind - wind interaction zone .",
    "the most important factors are the length of time before the mass - loss rate and ionizing photon rate decline sharply , and the acceleration timescale for the stellar wind . *",
    "the breakup of the shell of swept - up agb material due to instabilities complicates the wind - wind interaction region and none of our 2d models exhibits a clear double - shell pattern such as those observed by @xcite .",
    "the formation of clumps leads to dynamic opacity variations in the photoionized shell , which result in bright - rimmed clumps and a ray - like distribution of lower density photoionized gas in the agb envelope , which vary with time . *",
    "the formation and distribution of clumps and filaments has been shown to depend strongly on the cooling rate curve used and the ionization and temperature history of these clumps should be a function of the evolving stellar parameters and radiation field . although we take into account planetary nebula abundances and a representative radiation field when calculating the radiative losses , we do not take into account the time evolution of the stellar parameters nor do we include molecules or dust in our treatment of the neutral gas . * the creation of hydrodynamical instabilities results in mixing of agb material into the hot bubble , even for cases in which thermal conduction is not included",
    ". the temperature and density of the mixing zone are favourable for the emission of soft x - rays . *",
    "the inclusion of thermal conduction has several effects : it stops the bubble leaking hot gas through the gaps between the clumps and filaments by sealing them with evaporated material , and it increases the amount of agb material mixed into the hot bubble .",
    "models without conduction were found to form leaking bubbles with pressures dominated by the photoionized shell , whereas models with conduction resemble wind - blown bubbles surrounded by thin swept - up shells .",
    "this changes the appearance of the clumps around the edge of the hot bubble in the two cases .",
    "finally , in cases in which thermal conduction could be suppressed by a magnetic field , hydrodynamical instabilities will dominate the mixing of material into the hot bubble .",
    "the next paper in this series will consider the synthetic x - ray emission ( i.e. , emission measure , luminosity , surface brightness , and simulated spectra ) resulting from these simulations .",
    "we thank the referee , matthias steffen , for valuable suggestions that improved the presentation of this paper .",
