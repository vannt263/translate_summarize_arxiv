    "there is increasing evidence that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) exist at the center of all galaxies , and that they are the sources which power active galactic nuclei and quasars @xcite .",
    "for example , vlbi observations of the keplerian disk around an object in ngc4258 indicate that the central object has a mass @xmath11 and radius less than @xmath12pc .",
    "also , large numbers of observations are provided by the hubble space telescope suggesting that smbhs exist in galaxies such as m31 ( @xmath13 ) , m87 ( @xmath14 ) and our own galaxy ( @xmath15 ) ( see for example , * ? ? ? * for a brief overview ) .    although evidence of the existence of smbhs is compelling , the actual formation process of these objects is still uncertain @xcite .",
    "several different scenarios have been proposed , some based on stellar dynamics , others on gas hydrodynamics , and still others which combine the processes . in one stellar dynamical scenario , a dense star system composed of compact stars becomes dynamically unstable to a collisionless , relativistic radial mode and undergoes catastrophic collapse to a smbh @xcite . in an alternative scenario ,",
    "massive stars build up within a dense cluster , following collisions and mergers of ordinary stars .",
    "after repeated collisions and mergers , supermassive stars ( smss ) are formed , and these become unstable to a hydrodynamic , relativistic radial mode @xcite and eventually collapse to form smbhs @xcite . in still another scenario , massive halos of self - interacting dark matter in the early universe undergo the gravothermal catastrophe ( secular core collapse ) , followed by catastrophic collapse to smbhs once their cores become relativistic @xcite . in a typical gas hydrodynamical scenario ,",
    "a contracting primordial gas cloud builds up sufficient radiation pressure to inhibit fragmentation , and the gas directly builds up a sms @xcite .",
    "some mass inevitably will be shed but most of the matter is trapped during the ensuing gravitational collapse , forming a smbh . at present , there is no definitive observation as yet which confirms or rules out any one of these scenarios .",
    "here we focus on the collapse of a sms .",
    "@xcite investigated the equilibrium , stability and quasi - static evolution of a sms with uniform rotation . during quasi - static evolution , uniform rotation can be maintained either by internal viscosity or magnetic braking .",
    "they showed that the nondimensional ratios @xmath16 , @xmath5 and @xmath17 for all critical configurations at the onset of collapse are universal numbers , independent of the history or mass of the star . here",
    "@xmath1 is the proper polar radius , @xmath2 is the gravitational mass ( total mass - energy ) , @xmath18 is the rotational kinetic energy , @xmath19 is the gravitational binding energy and @xmath20 is the angular momentum .",
    "they also pointed out the possibility of bar formation during catastrophic collapse prior to bh formation , assuming that the collapse is nearly homologous ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "they provided a crude analytic argument suggesting that the imploding star should pass the dynamical bar - mode instability point @xmath9 at the radius @xmath22 , but were not able to assess the consequences of this fact .",
    "@xcite later investigated the quasi - static evolution of a sms with differential rotation , assuming negligible viscosity and magnetic fields .",
    "they showed that in this case , bar formation prior to the onset of relativistic instability is inevitable .",
    "one of the primary observational missions for space - based detection of gravitational waves is the investigation of supermassive objects @xcite .",
    "since the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) will have long arms ( @xmath23 ) , the detector will be most sensitive in the low frequency band ( @xmath24 hz ) .",
    "potential sources of high signal to noise events in this frequency range include quasi - periodic waves arising from nonaxisymmetric bars in collapsing smss and the inspiral of binary smbhs .",
    "in addition , the nonspherical collapse of rotating smss to smbhs could be a significant source of burst and quasi - normal ringing radiation . in this paper",
    "we tract the collapse of a sms by numerical simulation to investigate some of these possibilities .",
    "the growth of bars during the catastrophic collapse of stars has been studied previously for scenarios leading to core bounce , as in supernova core collapse . @xcite",
    "employed a two - component equation of state with an effective adiabatic index larger than @xmath25 , which causes bounce .",
    "they concluded that the star forms a bar in several dynamical timescales after it exceeds the critical value for dynamical bar - mode instability ( @xmath26 for newtonian incompressible equilibrium stars ) .",
    "but since the rotating core re - expands after the bounce and @xmath5 falls to a lower value @xmath27 , the nonaxisymmetric instability does not have sufficient time to enter the nonlinear regime and the bar does not grow .",
    "therefore , gravitational radiation is not generated effectively in this core bounce .",
    "@xcite considered the same problem but chose a different equation of state to allow the star more time ( by a factor of 100 ) to reside in the unstable regime @xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless , he too found that the dynamical instability was too weak to produce an appreciable bar and a large emission of gravitational waves .",
    "no one has considered the growth of bars during collapse without a bounce , which is the case for a sms where the adiabatic index is close to 4/3 .",
    "we take our initial stellar model to be a marginally unstable sms star near the critical point , @xmath28 .",
    "we treat the gas adiabatically , since for sufficiently massive stars neither photon nor neutrino losses are dynamically significant @xcite .",
    "we take the adiabatic index to be 4/3 , appropriate for a radiation - pressure dominated sms , and construct a critical , uniformly rotating polytrope with index @xmath29 for our starting point .",
    "our goal is to determine the final outcome of the collapse .",
    "we want to address the following questions : does a smbh definitely form following the catastrophic collapse ? is the collapse coherent or does the central region collapse first , followed by the gradual accretion of the envelope ? does the collapsing configuration fragment ? does a disk form ? does a rotating bar form during the collapse ?",
    "we use a post - newtonian ( pn ) hybrid hydrodynamical code in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions to tract sms collapse .",
    "our adopted hybrid scheme is relativistically exact for static spherical spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the onset of radial instability occurs when @xmath30 , so our initial equilibrium spacetime is very nearly spherical .",
    "locating the onset of radial instability in a sms requires the presence of nonlinear gravitation to at least 2pn order @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "the nonlinearity captured in our hybrid scheme , which extends beyond 1pn , is essential to treat this problem .",
    "of course , it is necessary to use a fully general relativistic code to follow the final implosion of the matter into a black hole ( bh ) and to reliably determine the gravitational waveforms .",
    "( @xcite followed sms collapse in full general relativity for a nonrotating configuration with a spherical [ 1 + 1 ] code ) .",
    "however , a fully relativistic ( 3 + 1 ) code capable of handling the large dynamic range spanned by sms collapse is not yet available .",
    "fortunately , since our initial configuration is nearly newtonian , we can use our hybrid scheme to track most of the implosion up to the point where the formation of a bh is likely .",
    "our hybrid scheme is also adequate to address most of the questions raised above , at least in a preliminary fashion .",

    "in this section , we briefly derive the ( 3 + 1 ) hybrid pn relativistic hydrodynamic equations @xcite in  comoving \" coordinates .",
    "we solve the fully relativistic equations for hydrodynamics , but neglect some higher - order dynamical pn terms in the einstein field equations . note",
    "that this approximation gives the exact solution for a static spherical spacetime . to track the collapse over the vast dynamic range from @xmath36 down to a few @xmath2 and to investigate the central core at late times , we require a suitable comoving coordinate system . such a coordinate choice is possible because in newtonian gravity , an @xmath7 spherical polytrope collapses homologously @xcite",
    "this special behavior does not strictly hold in general relativity @xcite , nor does it apply to a rotating configuration , but it holds approximately for much of the implosion of a critical sms configuration , since it is nearly newtonian and slowly rotating .",

    "even though @xmath5 may exceed @xmath129 in the final stages , there is not sufficient time for growth prior to the appearance of a hole .",
    "the reason for the absence of an instability is that @xmath5 does not grow as rapidly as @xmath130 during the late stage of collapse , as it would remain spherical ( see fig .",

    "these fragments may accrete on a longer timescale ( or even escape ) , but we can not track their evolution with our current calculation .",
    "figure [ fig : rcr ] shows the angular momentum distribution during the evolution . during the collapse ,",
    "the central layers begin rotating faster than the surface layers and the configuration , uniformly rotating initially , acquires appreciable differential rotation .",
    "if all of the initial mass - energy and angular momentum are consumed by the final bh , it will be rapidly rotating with @xmath135 ( see table [ tbl : rcinitial ] ) .",
    "although we can not follow the final formation and growth of the bh , our pn simula-    tions suggest that the final @xmath136 may be slightly lower ,    6.5 cm    due to the loss of angular momentum carried by gas orbiting near the equator .",
    "we follow rotating sms collapse from the onset of radial collapse at @xmath137 to the point where the pn approximation breaks down ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "the challenge of covering this large a dynamic range is met by introducing a scale factor and a `` comoving '' coordinate system which takes advantage of the homologous nature of the initial collapse .",

    "one possibility would be to use our output when the central fields are beginning to get strong ( @xmath158 ) as initial data for a fully relativistic ( 3 + 1 ) code .",
    "this would allow us to take advantage of the faster , more robust pn code to handle the newtonian and pn implosion regime and switch over to a fully general relativistic code only for the final strong - field phase of collapse .",
    "secondly , our computation would benefit significantly from nested grid method ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to handle the large dynamic range characterizing sms collapse .",
    "we have successfully exploited approximate homology by introducing a scale factor to set up an approximate comoving coordinate system .",
    "but homology breaks down at the center toward the end of the collapse .",
    "moreover it is difficult to follow the small amount of matter in the equatorial plane that is supported by centrifugal forces while the bulk of the matter collapses .",
    "nested grid method may provide one means of concentrating computational resources on the central region of the star while simultaneously resolving the low density outermost regions .",

    "<S> however , for stars rotating uniformly at the onset of collapse , we do not find any unstable growth of bars prior to the termination of our simulation at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we do find that the collapse is likely to form a supermassive black hole coherently , with almost all of the matter falling into the hole , leaving very little ejected matter to form a disk . in the absence of nonaxisymmetric bar formation , the collapse of a uniformly rotating supermassive star does not lead to appreciable quasi - periodic gravitational wave emission by the time our integrations terminate . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coherent nature of the implosion suggests that rotating supermassive star collapse will be a promising source of gravitational wave bursts . </S>",
