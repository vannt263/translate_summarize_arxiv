    "the work by prochaska et al .",
    "( 2003 ) provided a much more extensive data base over a wider range of redshift @xmath3 .",
    "all these data exhibited the same behavior .",
    "we earlier found that the data on dla systems could be explained by a simple closed - system model ( wasserburg & qian 2000b and fig . 1 here ) , where the number abundance ( fe / h ) of fe relative to h atoms in a dla system is determined by @xmath9 .",

    "it was found that the available data on [ fe / h ] for essentially all the dla systems lie between the prompt inventory value and the upper bound obtained for @xmath16 .",
    "the large dispersion in [ fe / h ] at a given @xmath6 could be explained by different @xmath15 for different dla systems .",
    "it was found that for the above closed - system model , most systems at a given @xmath6 have @xmath15 in a range close to @xmath14 ( i.e. , they `` turned on '' long after the big bang so that their baryonic matter had to be stored in the igm for this long period ) .",
    "the astrophysical implications of the late turn - on of most dla systems in the above closed - system model were explored by us in a recent study based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of hierarchical structure formation ( qian & wasserburg 2003b ) .",
    "we there associated the evolution of a dla system with the growth of a halo through infall of cdm and gas .",
    "the late turn - on was reinterpreted in terms of two factors .",
    "first , a halo must achieve some threshold mass before star formation could occur .",
    "as a halo associated with a low-@xmath17 density fluctuation reaches a given mass at a later time , fe production in such a halo would be delayed simply due to the later onset of star formation .",
    "second , subsequent to the onset of star formation , the growth of ( fe / h ) in the gas of a halo is determined by the competition between production by sne ii and dilution by gas infall . the uniform growth with time",
    "does not set in until infall ceases .",
    "thus , the late `` turn - on '' does not require the introduction of an arbitrary delay time @xmath15 but is a direct result of the infall rates in the cdm model of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "we here extend our model for chemical evolution of dla systems to a more general discussion of galactic chemical evolution . in ",

    "a comparison of our chemical evolution model with the data on dla systems is presented in  5 .",
    "possible scenarios of globular cluster formation in connection with this model are discussed and conclusions given in  6 .",
    "we first consider the chemical evolution of gas in a halo that grows according to hierarchical structure formation .",
    "we assume that cdm and gas are fed into the halo at a fixed mass ratio through infall . for simplicity",
    ", the infalling gas from the igm is assumed to be pure big bang debris ( i.e. , metal - free ) .",
    "observations show that the igm is significantly enriched with `` metallicities '' corresponding to [ fe / h ]  @xmath7 over a wide range of redshift @xmath18 ( e.g. , songaila 2001 ; pettini et al .",
    "2003 ; see also simcoe , sargent , & rauch 2002 , 2004 ; schaye et al .",
    "2003 ; aguirre et al .",
    "thus , the assumption of metal - free infalling gas is not necessarily valid .",
    "however , possible metallicities at the level of [ fe / h ]  @xmath7 for the infalling gas are soon overwhelmed by enrichments associated with astration in the halo .",
    "insofar as the evolution of the halo substantially enhances the metal content of its gas to well above [ fe / h ]  @xmath7 , neglecting the metallicity of the infalling gas is justified .",
    "the history of star formation in the halo is crucial to the chemical evolution of the gas .",
    "the issue of what the first generation of stars were like has long been a matter of intense interest .",
    "numerical simulations of collapse and fragmentation of metal - free gas clouds indicate that the first stars ( or baryonic aggregates ) were very massive .",
    "formation of normal stars may not have occurred until a `` metallicity '' corresponding to [ fe / h ]  @xmath19 was reached in the igm ( see bromm & larson 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "we do not consider the effect of this threshold metallicity that may possibly be required for normal astration .",
    "we assume that normal astration proceeds at a constant rate per h atom in the gas once the halo reaches some critical mass ( see  4 ) . from the discovery of a low - mass galactic halo star with [ fe / h ]  @xmath20 ( christlieb et al .",
    "2002 ) , it is evident that some low - mass stars were formed when the level of heavy metals in the igm was extremely low , far below the threshold metallicity for normal astration suggested by theoretical models ( bromm et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "it has long been recognized that stars in the galactic halo form a distinct population .",
    "extensive observational work has established that these stars have distinctively low [ fe / h ] ranging from typically @xmath21 ( e.g , carney et al .",

    "there is a clear break at [ fe / h ]  @xmath23 observed in the galactic evolution of [ ba / fe ] and [ o / fe ] with [ fe / h ] . for [ ba / fe ] , this break is due to the lack of major @xmath24-process contributions from asymptotic giant branch stars to the ba in the interstellar medium ( ism ) for [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 ( cf . ,",
    "busso , gallino , & wasserburg 1999 ) , while for [ o / fe ] , it is due to the lack of major fe contributions from sne ia for [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 ( tinsley 1979 ; see also kobayashi et al .",
    "in addition , the abundance patterns of the elements from the fe group down to o observed in galactic halo stars are characteristic of the nucleosynthetic yields of sne ii .",
    "thus , the overall abundances of `` metals '' in the early galaxy corresponding to [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 in the ism were clearly dominated by contributions from sne ii with massive ( @xmath25@xmath26 ) progenitors .",
    "we note that the marked change at [ fe / h ]  @xmath7 observed for the abundances of heavy @xmath27-process nuclei in galactic halo stars ( e.g. , mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; sneden et al . 1996",
    "; westin et al . 2000 ; burris et al .",
    "2000 ) appears to require a source other than sne ii for these nuclei ( qian & wasserburg 2003a ) .",
    "however , this @xmath27-process source can not produce any significant amount of the elements from the fe group down to o ( e.g. , qian & wasserburg 2002 ) , and therefore , does not affect our discussion of the chemical evolution of these elements here .",
    "based on the above discussion , we only consider metal production by sne ii subsequent to the onset of astration during the early evolution of a halo .",
    "the general effects of sne ia that contribute mainly the fe group elements at [ fe / h ]  @xmath28 will be discussed in  3 . for convenience , we use fe as a representative metal element . at [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath0 , the other elements ( from the fe group down to o ) essentially evolve in proportion to fe as specified by the effective yield pattern of sne ii ( see table 1 in qian & wasserburg 2002 ) .",
    "if gas in the halo is homogeneous and is not expelled by explosions of sne ii , the basic equation governing its chemical evolution ( qian & wasserburg 2003b ) may be written as : @xmath29 here ( fe / h ) is the number ratio of fe to h atoms in the gas , @xmath30 is the net rate of fe production by sne ii , ( h ) is the number of h atoms in the gas , and @xmath31 is the rate of infall of h atoms into the halo .",

    "the infall rate @xmath48 is not an arbitrary function of @xmath47 but is directly determined from the model of hierarchical structure formation discussed in barkana & loeb ( 2001 ) ( see below ) .",
    "the evolution of [ fe / h ] in halos with infall of big bang debris but without gas expulsion by sne ii can then be calculated in a straightforward manner .",

    "<S> we present an analytical and phenomenological model for metal enrichment in halos based on hierarchical structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> this model assumes that astration of normal stellar populations along with type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) already occurs at very high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> it focuses on the regime of [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 where sne ia are not major contributors . </S>",
    "<S> the regime of [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 where sne ia are major contributors is also discussed in general . for halos that are not disrupted by sn ii explosions , </S>",
    "<S> the chemical evolution of the gas and stars is explicitly determined by the rate of gas infall as compared with the astration rate and the corresponding rate of metal production by sne ii per h atom in the gas . </S>",
    "<S> this model provides a good description of the data on [ fe / h ] for damped ly@xmath2 systems over a wide range of redshift @xmath3 . for all halos not disrupted by sn ii explosions , </S>",
    "<S> if there is a cessation of gas infall , the metallicities of stars follow a bimodal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution is characterized by a sharp peak at the value of [ fe / h ] corresponding to the time of infall cessation and by a broad peak at a higher value of [ fe / h ] corresponding to the subsequent period of astration during which the bulk of the remaining gas forms stars . such a distribution may be compared to that observed for the galactic halo stars . if the gas in a halo is rapidly lost upon cessation of infall , then an assemblage of stars with a very sharply - defined [ fe / h ] value will be left behind . </S>",
    "<S> this assemblage of stars may be accreted by a larger system and become a globular cluster of the larger system . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the masses and metallicities of the globular clusters in this model considering the criterion for the onset of astration and possible disruption of low - mass halos by sn ii explosions . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of possible globular clusters with very low metallicities of [ fe / h ]  @xmath4 are discussed . </S>"
