    "the situation changes significantly in the deep sub - threshold region , where @xmath188 @xmath189 . for short pulses with @xmath190 ,",
    "the fpa results exceed that of ipa considerably , and the excess may reach several orders of magnitude , especially for the flat - top envelope shown by the solid curve in fig .  [ gfig:7 ]  ( right panel ) . however , when the number of oscillation in a pulse increases ( @xmath191 ) there is a qualitative convergence of fpa and ipa results , independently of the pulse shape .",
