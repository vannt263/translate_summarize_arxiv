    "note that @xmath87 is not a temperature in a genuine sense of thermodynamics since it depends on the charge to mass ratio of the emitted particles but is an unruh temperature for accelerating charges on the horizon .",
    "the schwinger effect in the rindler space has been first calculated by gabriel and spindel.@xcite .",
    "one interesting issue at the one - loop level is the gauge - gravity relation and the duality between the ds space and ads space .",

    "we have studied the emission of charged particles by a constant electric field in an ( a)ds space and from a near - extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole and discussed the gauge - gravity relation and the ds - ads duality in the ( a)ds .",
    "the charged black hole is the arena where the schwinger effect intertwined with the hawking radiation and where the gauge interplays with gravity .",
    "first , in the case of an extremal black hole , one expects no hawking radiation since the hawking temperature vanishes .",
    "the schwinger effect is the only channel for the emission of particles , which is nothing but the schwinger effect in the @xmath6 space with the horizon electric field since the near - horizon geometry is the @xmath6 space .",
    "second , in the case of the near - extremal black hole , the emission ( [ sch - haw ] ) of charged particles is dominated by the schwinger effect and contributed by an exponentially suppressed hawking radiation of a tiny hawking temperature .",
    "the exponentially small contribution is the schwinger effect with the horizon field in an accelerating frame with the surface gravity for the unruh temperature .",
    "the emission of neutral particles is proceeded by the hawking radiation since the schwinger temperature vanishes for those particles .",
    "one intriguing question is the entropy of the extremal black hole .",
    "the hawking temperature vanishes so that the entropy from the first law of black hole thermodynamics also vanishes . however , the entropy from the bekenstein - hawking area - law still is a quarter of the area of the event horizon .",
    "a question is whether the temperature ( [ eff tem ] ) combined with the first law may give the entropy .",
    "in fact , assuming the emission of charges with the same mass to charge ratio and by integrating the first law , we may obtain @xmath103 in the unrealistic evaporation of an extremal black hole keeping the condition @xmath104 , the schwinger effect may explain the entropy of the extremal black hole .",
    "however , in the standard particle model , the ratio is extremely small ( @xmath105 ) and the entropy from the schwinger effect is a tiny fraction of the black hole entropy .",
    "another interesting issue not treated in this paper but worthy to pursue is the particle production from a non - extremal charged black hole .",
    "one may expect that the hawking radiation and the schwinger effect works together in contrast to the near - extremal black hole in this paper .",
    "neutral particles are emitted through the hawking radiation . in the tunneling picture ,",
    "pairs are produced near the horizon of black hole .",
    "the near - horizon geometry of a near - extremal black hole is @xmath106 , while the near - horizon geometry of a non - extremal black hole is @xmath107 .",
    "the schwinger effect ( [ sch - haw ] ) is a consequence of including one pole at the inner horizon and another pole the outer horizon for the near - extremal black hole , which are adjacent to each other .",
    "however , for quantum fields in the non - extremal black hole , pair production occurs on the horizon , which becomes the rindler space.@xcite the particle production from charged black hole thus should include both the effects and will be addressed in a future publication .",
