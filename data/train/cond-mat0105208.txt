    "since the experimental achievement of bose - einstein condensates in confined alkali - metal gases in 1995 , there has been a huge experimental and theoretical interest in these systems @xcite .",
    "the study of vortices is one of the key issues .",
    "two different groups have obtained vortices experimentally , the jila group @xcite and the ens group @xcite . in the ens experiment ,",
    "a laser beam is imposed on the magnetic trap holding the atoms to create a harmonic anisotropic rotating potential . for sufficiently large angular velocities ,",
    "vortices are detected in the system .",
    "experimentally , the ens group @xcite has observed that when the vortex is nucleated , the contrast is not @xmath0 which means that the vortex line is not straight but bending .",
    "numerical computations solving the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite have shown that there is a range of velocities for which the vortex line is indeed bending .",
    "the aim of this paper is to justify these observations theoretically in the thomas fermi regime .",
    "we define an asymptotic parameter which is small in the thomas fermi regime and approximate the gross - pitaevskii energy to obtain a simpler form of the energy which only depends on the shape of the vortex lines .",
    "then we check numerically that our characterization leads to solution with a bent vortex for a range of values of the rotationnal velocity which are consistent with the ones obtained numerically @xcite .",
    "let us point out that svidzinsky and fetter @xcite have studied the dynamics of a vortex line depending on its curvature .",
    "for a vortex velocity equal to 0 , the equation obtained in @xcite is the same as the equation corresponding to the minimum of our approximate energy , though the formulation in @xcite was not derived from energy considerations .",
    "moreover , their analysis is only valid for a single vortex line .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii energy provides a very good description of bose - einstein condensates : it is assumed that the @xmath1 particles of the gas are condensed in the same state for which the wave function @xmath2 minimizes the gross - pitaevskii energy . in the ens experiment ,",
    "a laser is applied to the trap which makes it rotate . by introducing a rotating frame at the angular velocity @xmath3 ,",
    "the trapping potential becomes time independent , and the wave function @xmath2 minimizes the energy @xmath4 under the constraint @xmath5 . here , for any complex quantities @xmath6 and @xmath7 and their complex conjugates",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "we want to nondimensionnalize the energy in order to get a parameter which is small in the thomas - fermi regime .",
    "this framework of study has been developed by one of the authors in @xcite , except that @xcite was a two dimensionnal study for a condensate confined in the @xmath11 axis .",
    "we define the characteristic length @xmath12 and assume @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "we set @xmath15 where @xmath16 . for numerical applications",
    ", we are going to use the experimental values of the ens group @xcite , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "we find that @xmath23 , thus , @xmath24 is small , which will be our asymptotic regime .",
    "we re - scale the distance by @xmath25 and define @xmath26 where @xmath27 and we set @xmath28 .",
    "the velocity @xmath29 is chosen such that @xmath30 , that is the trapping potential is stronger than the inertial potential .",
    "the energy can be rewritten as : @xmath31 due to the constraint @xmath32 , we can add to @xmath33 any multiple of @xmath34 where @xmath35 for some constant @xmath36 to be determined .",
    "let @xmath37 be the ellipse @xmath38 .",
    "we impose the following constraint on @xmath39 : [ cons]_(*r*)=1.indeed , as @xmath24 tends to 0 , the minimizer will satisfy that @xmath40 will be close to @xmath39 so that the constraint will be satisfied automatically by @xmath6 if we impose ( [ cons ] ) . in other words , @xmath39 is the thomas fermi approximation of @xmath6 .",
    "equation ( [ cons ] ) leads to [ rho0 ] 0 ^ 5/2=15/8 . to study the problem analytically ,",
    "it is reasonable to minimize the energy over the domain @xmath37 with zero boundary data for @xmath6 . indeed , when @xmath41 , the energy is convex so that the minimizer @xmath6 goes to zero exponentially at infinity ( see the numerical observation in @xcite and the analysis on the behavior near the boundary of @xmath37 as well as the decay at infinity of the order parameter in @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the problem @xmath42 where @xmath43 note that a critical point @xmath6 of @xmath44 is a solution of [ eqbe ] -u+2i().u=1 ^ 2u(-|u|^2)+_u , with @xmath45 on @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the lagrange multiplier .",
    "the specific choice of @xmath36 in ( [ rho0 ] ) will imply that the term @xmath48 is negligible in front of @xmath49 .",
    "we have set the framework of study of our energy . in section 2",
    ", we will make an asymptotic development of the energy taking into account that @xmath24 is small ( but @xmath50 is not big ) . then in section 3",
    ", we will check that our approximate energy yields a solution which is consistent with the numerical and experimental observations .",
    "our aim is to decouple the energy into 3 terms : a part coming from the solution without vortices , a vortex contribution and a term due to rotation .",
    "firstly , we are interested in solutions without vortices , that is @xmath6 has no zero in the interior of @xmath37 .",
    "thus we consider functions of the form @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is in @xmath53 and @xmath54 is real and has no zero in the interior of @xmath37 .",
    "we consider first minimizing @xmath44 over such functions without imposing the constraint that the @xmath55 norm is 1 , that is , @xmath54 and @xmath56 minimize @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "we have @xmath59 on @xmath46 and [ f ]",
    "-f_+fs_(s_-2)=1 ^ 2f_(-f_^2 ) , [ s ] ( f_^2(s_-))=0.equation ( [ s ] ) implies that there exists @xmath60 in @xmath61 such that [ xinp ] f_^2(s_-)=  _ .",

    "= 0 . in the special case where the cross section of @xmath37 is a disc ,",
    "the minimum of ( [ fsener ] ) is reached for @xmath62 but this is not the case if the cross section is an ellipse and there is a non trivial solution of ( [ s ] ) .",
    "as @xmath24 tends to 0 , since the ellipticity of the cross - section is small , @xmath63 tends to @xmath39 in every compact subset of @xmath37 and the function @xmath60 given by ( [ xinp ] ) or ( [ xieq ] ) tends to the unique solution @xmath64 of [ xilim ] ( 1)=-2 , = 0",
    ". one can easily get that [ valxi ] ( x , y)=-^2(x , y)/(2 + 2 ^ 2)*e*_z.using ( [ xinp ] ) , we can define @xmath65 , the limit of @xmath66 , to be the solution of @xmath67 with zero value at the origin .",
    "we have @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "we see that @xmath65 vanishes when @xmath70 that is when the cross - section is a disc .",
    "this computation is consistent with the one in @xcite , though it is derived in a different way .",
    "let @xmath71 be the vortex free minimizer of @xmath44 discussed previously without imposing the constraint on the norm of @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath72 be a configuration that will minimize @xmath44 and let @xmath73 . since @xmath74 satisfies the gross pitaevskii equation ( [ f])-([s ] ) , we have @xmath75 using this identity , one can get that the energy @xmath76 decouples as follows [ splitener ] e_(u_)=e_(_)+g__(v_)+i__(v _ ) where @xmath77 and @xmath78 the first term in the energy is independent of the solution @xmath72 , so we have to compute the next two and find for which configuration @xmath72 the minimum is achieved .",
    "we assume that the solution @xmath72 has a vortex line along @xmath79 and we call @xmath80 the dirac measure along the line .",
    "our aim is to estimate the energy of @xmath72 depending on @xmath79 .",
    "a first approximation consists in writing that @xmath81 tends to @xmath39 when @xmath24 is small so that we can approximate @xmath82 by @xmath83 and @xmath84 by @xmath85 .",
    "we want to estimate @xmath87 the mathematical techniques to approximate @xmath88 have been introduced by @xcite in the 2 dimensionnal case and by @xcite in dimension 3 , when @xmath24 is very small .",
    "the problem here is that @xmath23 so that @xmath50 is not large and there will be additional terms in the asymptotic expansion . for a minimizing configuration , one can prove that @xmath89 is tending to 1 everywhere except close to the vortex line @xmath79 .",
    "we define [ t ] t_=\\ { x ( x,)},and assume that @xmath90 is small , @xmath91 being a nondimensionnal parameter to be fixed later on",
    ". then we split @xmath92 into two integrals : one in @xmath93 and the other in @xmath94 .",
    "we are going to estimate @xmath88 in @xmath93 .",
    "at each point @xmath95 of @xmath79 , we define @xmath96 to be the plane orthogonal to @xmath79 at @xmath95 . since @xmath90 is small , we assume that @xmath39 is constant in @xmath97 and we call the value @xmath98 .",
    "we want to compute @xmath99 since @xmath72 is a minimizing configuration of @xmath44 , after scaling by @xmath100 , we find that @xmath89 is very close to @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the solution with a single zero at the origin of @xmath103 thus , @xmath104 where @xmath105 the last approximation is good if @xmath106 is large ( in fact bigger than 3 is enough ) .",
    "the existence of @xmath91 is justified by the fact that @xmath107 is much bigger than 1 , except very close to the boundary .",
    "the final estimate of this section is [ gint ] g_(v_)_|t__(c_*2 + ( ) ) dl      we are going to estimate @xmath88 in @xmath94 . in this region @xmath108 , so that only the kinetic energy of the phase has a contribution .",
    "@xmath109 where @xmath110 is the phase of @xmath89 .",
    "of course , @xmath110 is not defined everywhere . but",
    "let @xmath111 be such that @xmath112 and @xmath113 then @xmath111 is the unique solution of [ psi ] ( 1)=2 ,  = 0 , where @xmath114 is the vectorial dirac measure along @xmath79 and @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the outward unit normal .",
    "we will see that @xmath111 is almost constant at a distance @xmath90 from @xmath79 and we call this value @xmath117 . since the vortex line has a winding number @xmath118 , @xmath119 we have to compute @xmath111 on @xmath120 .",
    "the computation is inspired by the paper of svidzinsky and fetter @xcite .",
    "it follows from ( [ psi ] ) that @xmath111 satisfies @xmath121 let @xmath122 .",
    "we denote by @xmath123 and @xmath124 an orthogonal base in local coordinates .",
    "then @xmath111 has coordinates @xmath125 in @xmath126 and the variations of @xmath127 are the only ones of influence in the equation for @xmath111 , since we want to compute @xmath128 .",
    "we approximate the equation for @xmath111 by [ psi3 ] -_3+_3=2 , where @xmath129 .",
    "let @xmath130 .",
    "then it follows from ( [ psi3 ] ) that @xmath131 satisfies [ xi ] -+=2where [ mu ] = = _ . here",
    "@xmath132 is the laplacian in the plane perpendicular to @xmath123 . if the cross - section is a disc one can compute @xmath133 .",
    "we denote by @xmath134 the angle of @xmath135 that is @xmath136and @xmath137 are the coordinates of @xmath138 in the original frame",
    ". then [ mudisc ] = ( 1+^2)+^2 ^ 2 + 3(r-^2z)^2 ^ 2 .",
    "note that @xmath139 .",
    "in fact our numerical computations even yield @xmath140 .",
    "our aim is now to give an approximate expression for @xmath131 .",
    "we locally approximate the curve @xmath79 near the point @xmath138 by the parabola @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the curvature of @xmath79 at @xmath138 .",
    "this is where we use the same ideas as in @xcite .",
    "note that in our approximations , we are only taking into account the shape of @xmath79 close to @xmath138 .",
    "the justification for this relies on the fact that @xmath140 as our numerics show . indeed if we solve @xmath143 where @xmath54 is supported at a distance @xmath144 of @xmath138 .",
    "then using the green function , we find that @xmath145 in particular , for @xmath146 , this gives an error less than @xmath147 .",
    "this is to be compared to the euler constant and our approximation is reasonnable .",
    "we rewrite ( [ xi ] ) in local coordinates to get @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the dirac mass supported along the line @xmath135 .",
    "thus [ xiexp ] -(e^-kx_12)+ ( ( k 2)^2 + ) ( e^-kx_12)=2_*e*_3 . the solution of this equation is @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a modified bessel function . in particular , @xmath152 for small @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the euler constant .",
    "hence , we deduce [ estpsi ] ( x)- ( e^c_02(x , ) ) .",

    "| t_- _ ( e^c_02 )  dl .",
    "we want to estimate [ i ] i_(v_)= _ ( s_- ) ( iv_,v_).recall that the unique solution of ( [ xieq ] ) satisfies @xmath156 .",
    "hence we integrate by part in ( [ i ] ) to get @xmath157 let @xmath110 be the phase of @xmath89 . since @xmath89 is tending to one everywhere except on the vortex line , then @xmath158 , hence we can approximate @xmath159 by @xmath160 .",
    "we use the value of @xmath64 given by ( [ valxi ] ) and the fact that @xmath161 to get [ iapp ] i_(v_)-_^2  dz .",
    "we use ( [ splitener])-([gint])-([gout])-([iapp ] ) to derive the energy of a solution with a vortex line .",
    "indeed the energy of any solution minus the energy of a solution without vortex is roughly the vortex contribution in the sense : e_(u_)-e _ ( _ ) _ .",
    "we find that the vortex contribution @xmath162 is @xmath163 hence if the right - hand - side of ( [ enerapp ] ) is negative , it means that it is energetically favorable to have vortices .",

    "we want to estimate the energy in this case . for each @xmath172",

    "one can check that the estimates ( [ iapp ] ) and ( [ gint ] ) , respectively for @xmath155 and for @xmath86 close to each vortex core , are unchanged if the integral along @xmath79 is replaced by the sum of the integrals along @xmath172 .",
    "the only difference is for the estimate away from the vortex cores where we have to take into account the interaction between the vortex lines .",
    "let us denote @xmath175 .",
    "we still have [ gm ] g_(v_)_|_n__n1 ||^2 , where @xmath176 and @xmath125 solves ( [ psi ] ) with @xmath172 instead of @xmath79 .",

    "= 2.8 in    one can observe that for @xmath202 , that is @xmath203 in the initial units , the energy of the bent vortex starts to be negative ( that is below the energy of a solution without vortex ) , while the energy of a straight vortex line is positive .",
    "for @xmath201 , the energy of the bent vortex and of a straight vortex line become equal .",
