    ", we examine the possible causes for the temperature dependence and conclude that redistribution of the doped holes is responsible . in principle , the observed change in electric field gradient could arise from changes in one or more of the three parts of equation ( 2 ) , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath42 . a change in the lattice contribution , @xmath47 ,",
    "would be caused by a change in the crystal structure or lattice parameters as a function of temperature . as discussed by carretta et al.,@xcite the change in lattice parameters as",
    "a function of temperature from 293 k to 520 k can account for less than 1% change in @xmath32 , while the experimental change is about 15% .",
    "similarly , we found that the change of lattice parameters would indicate a change of any component of @xmath1 of 1.5% or less , while the experimentally observed change is as much as 20% .",
    "in addition , the sign of the temperature dependence of @xmath1 is opposite to what would be expected from lattice expansion .",
    "as the lattice expands at higher temperatures , the electric field gradient from the lattice will generally decrease as we see in undoped la@xmath12ca@xmath13cu@xmath5o@xmath6 .",
    "clearly , the change in lattice parameters can not account for the change in quadrupole interaction .",
    "another option is that there is a local distortion in the crystal structure .",
    "our analysis using point charge calculations indicates that a local lattice distortion will not produce the experimentally measured sign of the temperature dependence at both the copper and two oxygen sites .",
    "the observed cu @xmath32 temperature dependence would require an increase in cu - o bond length , while the o @xmath1 would require a decrease .",
    "more complicated lattice distortions involving further neighboring atoms do not overcome this .",
    "thus , lattice changes are not responsible for the large change in electric field gradient .",
    "a second possible source for a change in electric field gradient is a change in the sternheimer antishielding factor , @xmath48 .",
    "however , shimizu@xcite showed that @xmath56 for copper does not vary significantly between copper oxide materials with doping and temperature .",

    "therefore , we conclude that temperature dependent @xmath59 in hole - doped ladders is very unlikely .",
    "the third and only remaining possibility is that a change in the hole concentration in the ladder cu@xmath2o@xmath3 layer changes @xmath42 of the doped samples . unlike lattice changes",

    "if holes do move from the chain layer to the ladder layer with increasing temperature , there is a consistent picture : the holes are all on the chain below 210 k and gradually transfer to the ladder plane at higher temperatures , as shown in fig . [ holes ] .",

    "in addition , the spectral weight of the conductivity peak is at least six orders of magnitude smaller than that expected using @xmath98 and an effective mass equal to the free electron mass .",

    "additionally , the peak in quadrupole relaxation for sr@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6@xcite implies that the hole motion slows down to the nmr frequency only at around 100 k , so the charge dynamics at higher temperatures such as t*=210 k should be faster than the nmr time scale , not slower . therefore , this delocalization scenario does not seem as consistent as the possibility of holes transferring from the chain to the ladder layer .",

    "holes are excluded from the majority of the ladder plane below t * , when the two - leg ladder is in the low temperature spin - gapped state . above t * , the spin - gapped state is disturbed by holes and spin excitations are seen in 1/t@xmath86 and magnetic susceptibility .",

    "<S> nmr measurements of the @xmath0o nuclear quadrupole interactions , @xmath1 , show that the charge environment of the s=1/2 cu@xmath2o@xmath3 two - leg spin - ladder layer of hole - doped a@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 changes dramatically above a certain temperature , t*. this temperature , t * , decreases with additional doping and is correlated with the magnetic crossover from the spin gap regime to the paramagnetic regime . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that these changes in @xmath1 are consistent with an increase in the effective hole concentration in the cu@xmath2o@xmath3 two - leg ladder above t*. the effective hole concentration increases primarily in the oxygen 2p@xmath7 orbitals . </S>"
