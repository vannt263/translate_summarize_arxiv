    "if two random variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 are freely independent , there is a universal rule , independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for computing the mixed moments of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from just the moments of @xmath0 and the moments of @xmath1 .",
    "this has been a very useful tool in random matrix theory as independent ensembles are asymptotically free , provided that at least one of them is unitarily , or orthogonally , invariant ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the study of fluctuations of the distribution of eigenvalues around their mean , for various ensembles of random matrices , goes back to the work of dyson ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these fluctuations can be often described by the use of fluctuation moments .",
    "second order freeness was developed by mingo and speicher ( see @xcite , @xcite ) to give a universal rule for computing mixed fluctuation moments in terms of the individual fluctuation moments .",
    "random variables are second order free when this universal rule holds .",
    "it was shown , in @xcite that , as in the case of voiculescu s freeness , independent ensembles are asymptotically second order free provided that at least one of them is unitarily invariant .    in the case of second order freeness differences in the symmetries of the matrices become apparent .",
    "emily redelmeier @xcite showed that for the goe , real wishart matrices , and real ginibre matrices a different universal rule was needed . in the first order case , i.e.  voiculescu s freeness , no difference between real and complex matrices is observed . in the second order case new terms appeared .",
    "redelmeier called this new universal rule",
    "_ real second order freeness_. in @xcite the authors showed that independent and orthogonally invariant matrices are asymptotically real second order free . since the orthogonal group is a subgroup of the unitary group , both rules apply in the case of unitarily invariant ensembles .    in order to resolve the discrepancy between the two rules the authors",
    "were led to examine the role played by the transpose in random matrix theory .",
    "this lead to the surprising fact that many ensembles of random matrices are asymptotically free from their transposes .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that for unitarily invariant ensembles the transpose does produce asymptotic freeness ( see corollary [ cor : t - free ] and proposition [ prop:31 ] ) .",
    "let us illustrate this with a simple example , see figure [ fig-1 ] .",
