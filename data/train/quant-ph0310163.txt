    "quantum information theory  @xcite is a rapidly evolving field .",
    "it uses quantum systems to process information and by doing so can achieve things that are not possible with classical resources .",
    "quantum secure communication for instance is already commercially available .",
    "quantum computation on the other hand is still far from being useful outside of the academic community .",
    "two serious obstacles to overcome in building quantum computers are : ( i ) one must be able to control the evolution in order to precisely implement quantum gates , ( ii ) one must suppress all external influences .",
    "errors in both cases are caused by the perturbation of an ideal quantum computer , either due to the internal imperfections in the first case or due to coupling with the `` environment '' in the second case . in the present paper",
    "we study both kind of errors in qft algorithm and try to minimize them .    in order to be closer to the experimental situation",
    "we choose a concrete model of a quantum computer , namely the ising quantum computer ( iqc )  @xcite .",
    "iqc is one of the simplest models still having enough complexity to allow universal quantum computation .",
    "quantum gates on this computer can be realized by the application of electromagnetic pulses . for the algorithm",
    "we choose to discuss qft .",
    "the first reason to choose qft is that it is one of the most useful quantum algorithms , giving exponential speedup over the best classical procedure known , and is also one of the ingredients of some other important algorithms , e.g. shor s factoring algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the second reason is that it is a complex algorithm , where by complex we mean it has more than @xmath1 number of quantum gates as opposed to previously studied more simple algorithms where the number of gates scales only linearly with the size of the computer ( e.g. entanglement protocol  @xcite ) .",
    "previous study of shor s algorithm in iqc  @xcite did not use recently introduced generalized @xmath2 method  @xcite which is the best known procedure for inducing transitions on iqc .",
    "it is easy to imagine that in most useful quantum algorithms the size of the program will grow faster than linearly with the number of qubits @xmath3 and therefore it is important to see how errors accumulate in such algorithms .",
    "this importance is confirmed by our results showing that errors due to unwanted transitions for qft grow with the _ square _ of the number of pulses and not _ linearly _ as in algorithms with linear @xmath1 number of gates , for a typical state .    for qft algorithm running on iqc",
    "we analyze errors due to spurious transitions caused by pulses , these we call _ intrinsic errors _ , and errors due to the coupling with an external `` environment '' , called _ external errors _ , modeled by a random hermitian matrix from a gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue )  @xcite",
    ". we minimize intrinsic errors by applying some additional pulses to correct most probable errors  @xcite and by doing this , we are able to suppress intrinsic errors by several orders of magnitude . to suppress external errors due to gue perturbation we use previously proposed improved quantum fourier transformation ( iqft )  @xcite which is more stable against gue perturbations in a certain range of parameters . by using correlation function approach  @xcite",
    "we analyze in detail the dependence of errors on all relevant parameters and on the number of qubits @xmath3 . by doing this",
    "we can set the limits between which parameters of iqc should lay in order to preserve the stability of computation . in our approach to decrease errors we do not use error correcting codes for the following reasons : we want to remove as many errors as we can on the lowest possible level and second , the intrinsic and external errors are not easily handled by error correcting codes ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we repeat the definition of iqc and in section iii we summarize linear response formalism which is the main theoretical tool for studying fidelity . in section",
    "iv we study intrinsic and external errors , first separately and then the case of both errors present at the same time . in the appendix we present the pulse sequences used to implement qft and iqft algorithms .",
    "iqc consists of a 1-dimensional chain of @xmath3 equally spaced identical spin @xmath4 particles coupled by nearest neighbor ising interaction of strength @xmath5 , so that parallel spins are favored over anti - parallel ones by an energy difference of @xmath5 ( we set @xmath6 throughout the paper ) .",
    "the quantum computer is operated via an external magnetic field having two components .",
    "the first one is a permanent magnetic field oriented in the @xmath7 direction with a constant gradient which allows for the selective excitation of individual spins , while the second one is a sequence of @xmath8 circular polarized fields in the @xmath9-@xmath10 plane ( which are called pulses ) with different frequencies @xmath11 , amplitudes ( proportional to the rabi frequencies @xmath12 ) , phases @xmath13 and durations @xmath14 for the @xmath15th pulse , in which is encoded the protocol .",
    "a particular orientation of the register allows to suppress the dipole - dipole interaction between spins  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath16 with @xmath17 @xmath18 equal to one during the @xmath15th pulse and zero otherwise , @xmath19 the usual pauli operators for spin @xmath20 and @xmath21 . due to the constant gradient of the permanent magnetic field ,",
    "the larmor frequencies depend linearly on @xmath20 , @xmath22 . by appropriately choosing the energy units we fix @xmath23 throughout the paper so that the only relevant energy scales are @xmath12 and @xmath24 .",
    "the basis states are chosen so that @xmath25 .",
    "we will introduce the following notation for further discussion .",
    "let the pulse @xmath26 indicate a pulse with frequency @xmath27 resonant with the flip of the @xmath28-th spin if its neighbors are in states `` @xmath24 '' and `` @xmath29 '' .",
    "this will induce the resonant transition @xmath30 , named @xmath31 , if the pulse is a @xmath32 pulse ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "note that for edge qubits , i.e. @xmath34 , only one superscript is needed .",
    "operating iqc in the _ selective excitation regime _ , @xmath35 , allows one to separate transitions induced by pulses into three sets : _ resonant _ , _ near - resonant _ and _ non - resonant _ according to the detuning @xmath36 of the transition which is the difference between the frequency of the pulse and the energy difference of the states involved in the transition . if @xmath36 is exactly equal to zero , the transition is called resonant ( @xmath31 induced by the pulse @xmath26 ) , if @xmath36 is of the order of @xmath5 it is called near - resonant ( @xmath37 induced by the pulse @xmath26 with @xmath38 ) , and if @xmath36 is of the order of @xmath24 it is called non - resonant ( @xmath39 induced by the pulse @xmath26 with @xmath40 ) . in the implementation of a protocol",
    "resonant transitions are the ones wanted , while near - resonant and non - resonant transitions are a source of error .    in the two level approximation  @xcite ,",
    "a given unwanted transition with detuning @xmath36 is induced with probability @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a dimensionless duration of the pulse ( for a @xmath32 pulse @xmath43 and for @xmath44 pulse it is @xmath4 ) .",
    "the most probable transitions are the near - resonant ones and these can be suppressed as briefly described in the next paragraph .    for @xmath45 pulses all near - resonant transitions have the same detuning so setting @xmath46 to @xmath47 with @xmath48 an integer suppresses these transitions .",
    "since for near - resonant transitions @xmath49 , rabi frequency is for all pulses of the order of @xmath50 . on the other hand , for @xmath51 and @xmath52 pulses near - resonant transitions have two different detunings therefore it is impossible to suppress both with a single pulse .",
    "this problem can be overcome adding an additional correcting @xmath53 pulse .",
    "the combination of these pulses in order to suppress all near - resonant transitions is called @xmath54-pulse denoted by @xmath55 when doing a @xmath56 rotation of the @xmath57 qubit if neighbors are in states `` @xmath24 '' and `` @xmath29 '' .",
    "this method to eliminate near - resonant transitions is called generalized @xmath0 method .",
    "we refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    "@xmath54-pulses are the basic building blocks of gates , which in turn are the building blocks of algorithms such as qft and iqft .",
    "qft for @xmath58 qubits can be written as @xmath59 there are in total @xmath3 hadamard @xmath60 gates , @xmath61 two - qubit @xmath62 gates , @xmath63 , with @xmath64 and one transposition gate @xmath65 which reverses the order of qubits ( e.g. @xmath66 ) . in total",
    "there are @xmath67 gates .",
    "iqft algorithm  @xcite for @xmath58 qubits is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath70 gate is defined by @xmath71 . in total",
    "there are @xmath72 gates in iqft , i.e. roughly two times as many as for qft .",
    "recall that the implementation of quantum gates on iqc is easier in the interaction frame .",
    "therefore , pulse sequences used in the paper implement the intended gates in the interaction frame .",
    "each gate for qft or iqft ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qft4 ] ) and ( [ eq : iqft4 ] ) ) must in turn be implemented by several pulses ( see appendix ) .",
    "the number of pulses for qft grows as @xmath73 whereas it grows as @xmath74 for iqft .",
    "note that this number can become very large , e.g. for iqft and @xmath75 one has @xmath76 pulses . throughout the paper",
    "our basic unit of time will be either a gate ( as written for instance in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qft4 ] ) and ( [ eq : iqft4 ] ) ) or a pulse",
    ". a single exception will be the paragraph discussing correlation function of intrinsic errors , where the basic unit is a @xmath54-pulse , which is composed of one or two pulses .",
    "the reason is that @xmath54-pulses are the smallest near - resonant corrected unit of generalized @xmath0 method .",
    "as a criteria for stability we will use the fidelity @xmath77 , defined as an overlap between a state @xmath78 obtained by an evolution with an ideal algorithm and the perturbed @xmath79 obtained by the perturbed evolution : @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "to simplify matters we will assume time @xmath83 to be a discrete integer variable , denoting some basic time unit of an algorithm , like a gate or a pulse .",
    "the quantity measuring the success of the whole algorithm is the fidelity @xmath77 at @xmath84 where @xmath8 denotes the number of gates ( pulses ) .",
    "one of the most useful approaches to studying fidelity is using linear response formalism in terms of correlation function of the perturbation , for a review see ref .",
    "this approach has several advantages .",
    "first it rewrites the complicated quantity fidelity in terms of a simpler one , namely the correlation function , simplifying the understanding of the fidelity .",
    "second , the scaling of errors with the perturbation strength , planck s constant and with the number of qubits is easily deduced . furthermore ,",
    "as in practice one is usually interested in the regime of high fidelity , linear response is enough .",
    "first we will shortly repeat linear response formulas as they will be useful for our discussion later .",
    "let us write an ideal algorithm up to gate @xmath83 as @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the @xmath28-th gate ( pulse ) .",
    "if @xmath84 we have a decomposition of a whole algorithm .",
    "the perturbed algorithm can be similarly decomposed into gates @xmath88 each perturbed gate @xmath89 is now written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the perturbation of @xmath92-th gate and @xmath93 is a dimensionless perturbation strength .",
    "for any perturbed gate one can find a perturbation generator @xmath94 , such that the relation  ( [ eq : v ] ) will hold .",
    "observe that the distinction into perturbation strength @xmath93 and the perturbation generator @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) is somehow arbitrary . if one is given an ideal gate @xmath95 and a perturbed one @xmath96 one is able to calculate only a product @xmath97 .",
    "this arbitrariness can always be fixed by demanding for instance that the second moment of the perturbation @xmath94 in a given state equals to @xmath98 , @xmath99 .    to the lowest order in the perturbation strength fidelity",
    "can be written as  @xcite @xmath100 where the correlation function of the perturbation is @xmath101 with @xmath102 being the perturbation of @xmath92-th gate propagated by an ideal algorithm up to time @xmath83 , i.e. in the heisenberg picture .",
    "the brackets @xmath103 denote the expectation value in the initial state . throughout the paper",
    "we use random gaussian initial states and average over many of them to reduce statistical fluctuations .",
    "note that the time dependence of the correlation function  ( [ eq : c ] ) is due to two reasons : one is time dependence due to the heisenberg picture ( time index in brackets ) and the second one is due to the time dependence of the perturbation itself ( time index as a subscript ) , i.e. one has different perturbations @xmath104 for different gates @xmath105 .",
    "the expression for the fidelity eq .",
    "( [ eq : lr ] ) is the main result of the linear response theory of the fidelity . from this one",
    "can see that decreasing the correlation sum ( or even making it zero , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) will increase the fidelity . in ref .",
    "@xcite stability of qft algorithm was considered with respect to static gue perturbation . analyzing the correlation function",
    "they were able to design an improved qft algorithm ( iqft ) which increases fidelity .",
    "we are mainly interested in the fidelity @xmath106 at the end of an algorithm .",
    "the final time @xmath8 in useful quantum algorithms depends on the number of qubits in a polynomial way , say as @xmath107 .",
    "the power @xmath108 depends on the algorithm considered and of course also on our decomposition of an algorithm into gates ( pulses ) . for qft and iqft algorithms with decomposition into gates , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qft4 ] ) and ( [ eq : iqft4 ] ) , one has @xmath109 . on the other hand , for the implementation of qft on iqc one needs @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) basic electromagnetic pulses , as one is not able to directly perform @xmath112 gates on distant qubits but has to instead use a number of pulses proportional to the distance between the qubits @xmath113 .",
    "now if the correlation function decays sufficiently fast , the fidelity will decay like @xmath114 whereas in the case of slow correlation decay the fidelity will decay as @xmath115 . in the extreme case of perturbations at different gates being statistically uncorrelated ( very fast decay of correlations )",
    "@xmath116 one obtains the exact formula @xmath117  @xcite . in the limit of large quantum computer ( large @xmath3 ) strongly correlated static errors , giving slow decay of correlations , will therefore be dominant due to fast @xmath118 growth .",
    "when we will discuss errors caused by perturbations due to the coupling with the environment we will focus on static perturbations , meaning the same perturbation on all gates , @xmath119 , as this component will dominate large @xmath3 behavior .",
    "errors in an experimental implementation of qft algorithm on an iqc can be of three kinds : ( i ) due to unwanted transitions caused by electromagnetic pulses ( ii ) due to coupling with external degrees of freedom and ( iii ) due to variation of system parameters in the course of algorithm execution . in the present paper",
    "we will discuss only the first two errors .",
    "errors due to electromagnetic pulses are inherent to all algorithms on an iqc as we are presently unable to design pulse sequences for quantum gates without generating some unwanted transitions albeit with small probabilities .",
    "this errors can be in principle decreased by going sufficiently deep into selective excitation regime but one must of course keep in mind the limitations of real experiments .",
    "coupling with the `` environmental '' degrees of freedom is endemic in all implementations of quantum computers . as the environment",
    "will usually have many degrees of freedom we will model its influence on the quantum computer by some effective perturbation @xmath120 given by a random matrix from a gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue )  @xcite . note that coupling with the environment will generally cause non - unitary evolution of the central system .",
    "we expect quantum computation to be stable only on a time scale where evolution is approximately unitary , i.e. for times smaller than the non - unitarity time scale",
    ". therefore we limit ourselves to _ unitary _ external perturbations . the third kind of errors due to the variation of system parameters , like e.g. variation of larmor frequencies due to the variation of the magnetic field is not considered in this paper .",
    "this does not mean they are not important .",
    "let us consider a systematic error in the gradient of the magnetic field throughout the protocol ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "demanding that the error in the largest eigenphase at the end of the algorithm is much smaller than @xmath98 , one gets the condition @xmath122 .",
    "if one is in the selective excitation regime , this ratio can become very large and this puts a severe demand on the experiments .    to ease up understanding",
    "we will first discuss intrinsic errors only , then we will discuss external errors only and finally we will combine both errors .",
    "let us consider probabilities of non and near - resonant transitions . for near - resonant and non - resonant transitions we have @xmath123 and",
    "the probability given by the perturbation theory is @xmath124 . in the @xmath0 method",
    "rabi frequency @xmath46 is given as @xmath125 so the probabilities for near - resonant and non - resonant transitions are @xmath126 where @xmath127 denotes probability of a non - resonant transition with @xmath128 involving @xmath92-th and @xmath20-th spin , one of which is a resonant one .",
    "the dependence of near and non - resonant errors on system parameters is therefore different .    for pulse sequences used to generate qft or iqft we always used a generalized @xmath0 method by which one can get rid of all near - resonant transitions .",
    "therefore the only errors that remain are non - resonant ones .",
    "we first checked numerically that this is indeed the case by studying dependence of errors on system parameters by which one is able to distinguish near and non - resonant errors , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nearnon ] ) .",
    "dependence of fidelity on physical parameters of the system .",
    "empty points indicate variation of @xmath48 with @xmath129 , filled points indicate variation of @xmath24 with @xmath130 , both for @xmath131 .",
    "full line is theoretical dependence of @xmath132 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nearnon ] ) . ]    as one can observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : presek ] the agreement with the theoretical @xmath132 ( eq .  ( [ eq : nearnon ] ) ) is excellent thereby confirming that the only errors left are non - resonant ones . by using generalized @xmath0 method",
    "we therefore decreased intrinsic errors by a factor of @xmath133 as compared to ordinary @xmath0 method where there are still some near - resonant errors present . in order to have complete understanding of fidelity decay due to intrinsic errors we have to understand scaling of these with the number of qubits .",
    "as we already discussed in section  [ sec : lr ] this depends on two things : how strong the errors are correlated , giving possible scalings from @xmath134 to @xmath135 and on the increase of the perturbation strength with the number of qubits .",
    "let us first discuss the later . under the assumption that the average transition probability ( i.e. perturbation strength ) for a non - resonant transition is the sum of all possible non - resonant transitions averaged over all possible resonant qubits , we can estimate @xmath136 ^ 2   \\left ( \\frac{\\pi^2}{3}-\\alpha \\frac{\\log{n}}{n } \\right ) , \\label{eq : avgp}\\ ] ] with @xmath137 some @xmath3 independent constant .",
    "we can see that the perturbation strength does not grow with @xmath3 asymptotically , but the convergence to its limit is logarithmically slow . for small @xmath3",
    "the perturbation strength therefore will grow with @xmath3 whereas it will saturate for large @xmath3 .",
    "the second contribution to the @xmath3-dependence of the fidelity comes from the dynamical correlations between errors given by the correlation function  ( [ eq : c ] ) of the perturbation generator for non - resonant errors .",
    "we numerically calculated this correlation function in order to understand how the correlation sum and therefore fidelity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lr ] ) , behaves as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "( color online ) correlation function for intrinsic errors in qft for @xmath130 , @xmath129 , @xmath58 .",

    "( [ eq : lr ] ) .",
    "vertical lines indicate beginning of each gate ( eq .  ( [ eq : qft4 ] ) ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrfun ] we show @xmath139 averaged over all hilbert space .",
    "one can see that there are large 2-dimensional regions of high correlations in all parts of the picture .",
    "this means there are strong correlations between errors at different pulses and therefore the correlation sum will likely grow as @xmath140 as the number of pulses scales as @xmath141 for our implementation of qft .",
    "similar results are obtained also for iqft as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : nonn ] .",
    "one interesting thing to note is that during the application of the transposition gate at the end of the protocol the correlation sum starts to decrease at some point , nicely seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrsum ] and also visible in the correlation picture in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrfun ] as there are more negative than positive areas towards the end of the algorithm .",
    "this very interesting phenomena means that applying transposition at the end is advantageous ( as compared to doing it classically for instance ) as it will decrease non - resonant errors .",
    "we checked that this principle can not be exploited further by repeating transposition many times and by this decreasing correlation sum even more .",
    "still , this surprising behavior suggests that it might be possible to decrease non - resonant errors in a systematic way .",

    "one can see that asymptotically for large @xmath3 the dependence is indeed @xmath144 but the convergence to this behavior is fairly slow , one needs of the order of @xmath148 or more qubits .",

    "therefore relative to the number of pulses iqft slightly decreases non - resonant errors but in the absolute sense qft is better simply because it has only one third as many pulses as iqft and the coefficient in front of @xmath144 ( eq .",

    "if only intrinsic errors in the generalized @xmath0 method are concerned qft is always more stable than iqft .",
    "note that the intrinsic errors due to non - resonant transitions for qft grow as @xmath157 ( @xmath145 ) whereas in previously studied `` simple '' algorithms , for instance entanglement protocol  @xcite , they grow only as the first power of the number of gates @xmath158 .",
    "this means that qft is much more sensitive to intrinsic errors .      in order to study only external errors we set throughout this section parameters to @xmath147 and @xmath143 , for which intrinsic errors are much smaller than external ones .",

    "we will make perturbation after each quantum gate , except for the last transposition gate @xmath65 , eq .",

    "we will discuss this possibility at the end of this section .",
    "for now let us just say that qualitatively the results are the same as if doing perturbation after each gate , one just has to rescale perturbation strength like @xmath161 as there are effectively @xmath1 perturbations ( pulses ) per gate .",

    "there are still two possibilities , either making static perturbation in the interaction frame or making it static in the laboratory frame .",
    "let us first discuss the later case .",

    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "this transformation @xmath165 will result in the perturbation in the interaction frame @xmath166 being time dependent .",
    "as the transformation to the laboratory frame @xmath167 in the selective excitation regime involves large phases , perturbations at different gates will tend to be uncorrelated due to averaging out of widely oscillating factors in the correlation function  ( [ eq : c ] ) .",

    "on the other hand , if we make perturbation to be static in the interaction frame and the correlation function is not kronecker delta in time , the fidelity will decay faster with the number of qubits ( or @xmath8 ) . to numerically confirm these arguments , we show in fig .",

    "this unfavorable growth of required @xmath219 in order to have a fixed fidelity is due to @xmath145 growth of intrinsic errors",
    ". it would therefore be advantageous to find a way to suppress errors due to non - resonant transitions  @xcite .",
    "we analyzed two possible errors in the implementation of qft on iqc working in the selective excitation regime .",
    "we consider : ( i ) intrinsic errors due to unwanted transitions caused by pulses , ( ii ) external errors due to coupling with the external degrees of freedom .",
    "we carefully analyze their dependence on system parameters and on the number of qubits . to diminish intrinsic errors we use the generalized @xmath0 method by which we are able to suppress all near - resonant transitions , with only much smaller non - resonant transitions remaining .",
    "we then study these non - resonant errors in qft algorithm and by using correlation function formalism explain their growth with time as @xmath157 , in contrast to so far studied `` simple '' algorithms ( having @xmath1 gates ) , where the growth is linear in time .",
    "the immediate question is whether this behavior is general for algorithms having more than @xmath1 gates .",
    "this very fast growth with @xmath3 is a consequence of strong correlations between errors at different pulses and puts a severe demand on experimental requirements",
    ". therefore it would certainly be desirable to find a way to suppress also non - resonant errors .",
    "we also consider perturbations due to coupling with external degrees of freedom modeled by a random gue matrix . to suppress this kind of errors",
    "we show that it is advantageous to use an improved qft algorithm , for which the errors grow only as @xmath183 , whereas they grow as @xmath182 for ordinary qft . by a combination of both techniques , the generalized @xmath0 method and",
