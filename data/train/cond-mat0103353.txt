    "the advent of modern computers has made it possible to study many - dimensional dynamical systems in detail and to ferret out previously unsuspected characteristics .",
    "phenomena such as relaxation to equilibrium @xcite , lack of ergodicity @xcite , and connection of dynamical to statistical properties @xcite have been explored numerically .",
    "a category of models that continue to enjoy great attention is that of interacting - electron systems . in this paper",
    "we consider a particular member of this class : the classical dynamics of the confined two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "while various aspects of 2deg have been well - studied , it remains a convenient and relatively tractable system to understand dynamical properties of complex systems .",
    "it is well - known that at low temperatures the electron system freezes into an hexagonal wigner lattice @xcite .",
    "extensive studies have been made of the possible conformations that result when this simple system is perturbed @xcite .",
    "a simple example is provided by the inter - layer coupling between vertically separated 2degs which enhances the stability of the square lattice relative to the hexagonal @xcite .",
    "the melting and structural transitions have also been well - studied @xcite .",
    "the confinement is also a possible perturbation ",
    "ideal hexagonal lattice is obtained only for infinite system .    however , commonly used confining potentials preserve the hexagonal character with only slight edge distortions .",
    "perturbed 2deg models have relevance beyond electron systems : experiments on dusty plasmas @xcite and ion plasmas @xcite have been usefully explained in terms of formation of few layered and bi - layered coulomb lattices .",
    "the classical behavior of a confined 2deg subject to an external magnetic field has been of some recent theoretical use @xcite .",
    "in particular the magnetotransport phenomena in 2deg have lead to important physical insights .",
    "new systems have been proposed in which the electron motion in 2deg is nontrivially altered by a ( possibly non - homogeneous ) magnetic field @xcite .",
    "some possibilities have been realized by advances in the semiconductor technology @xcite .",
    "such systems are studied quantum mechanically for a full understanding but many features can already be appreciated within the classical theory . for example , the classical chaos was found to control the low - field transport in systems with competing magnetic and electrostatic modulation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we analyze the structure and dynamics of 2deg on a novel geometry .",
    "the electrons are constrained to the surface of a cylinder of radius @xmath0 and confined along the @xmath1 direction to a strip of width @xmath2 by the potential of the uniform static positive background .",
    "we chose this geometry because it allows the electrons to carry a current along the @xmath3 direction .",
    "we apply the external electric and magnetic fields and observe the time - dependent response .",
    "we have been motivated to this problem by certain reflections on usual textbook derivations of the classical 3-dimensional hall effect @xcite .",
    "these derivations are based on free - electron drude theory and consider independent electrons drifting with a common and constant drift velocity @xmath4 .",
    "it is then easy to show that a constant transverse electric field , generated by excess boundary charge , can balance the magnetic force and bring a steady state . in the context of a classical 2-dimensional many",
    "degree - of - freedom interacting system this simple picture could be dynamically unstable .",
    "here we conduct numerical experiments to see if a regime of interacting electrons drifting with a common uniform velocity can be attained in a 2d many - body system",
    ". a peculiarity of 2deg is that the coulomb field escapes from the surface ; in 3d a constant transverse hall field can be nicely produced by the boundary electrons only , while in 2d , because of gauss s law , these boundary electrons can only produce a @xmath5 field ( the field of a charged wire ) .",
    "we see then that a global charge redistribution is called upon for to produce a constant field .",
    "the lagrangian for @xmath6 interacting electrons confined by the background potential @xmath7 and subject to an external radial magnetic field @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the coordinate of the @xmath11th electron and @xmath12 is the distance between @xmath11th and @xmath13th electrons and @xmath14 is the speed of light .",
    "the electronic mass and charge are @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively . to remove any ambiguity we clarify that distances are not calculated along the surface but are ordinary three - dimensional distances : @xmath17 .",
    "the rotation symmetry possessed by @xmath18 implies the noether s constant : @xmath19 the resulting equations of motion are @xmath20 where the confining potential @xmath7  of the positive background is taken to be either    @xmath21    or    @xmath22    the stripe being symmetrical about @xmath23 and extending from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . the first potential is flat but rises steeply near the edges .",
    "the second potential has more parabolic character and is an approximation to the exact potential of a positive background : we found analytical solution for the potential of a positively charged flat rectangle with the same width and length of our cylindrical background , and the above second potential approximates this analytic form .",
    "the use of potentials with differing characters helps in distinguishing any peculiar effect of confinement from overall observations .",
    "these potentials are sketched in fig.([confine ] ) .",
    "the form of equation ( 1 ) is simplified by using scaled units : lengths may be scaled by the average interelectronic distance @xmath26 : @xmath27 and time is scaled as @xmath28 where @xmath29 . in these units",
    "the equations of motion are    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the two - dimensional number density of the electron gas .",
    "for example at the experimentally attainable @xmath33 @xmath34 the above formula gives @xmath35 tesla . because of the scale - invariance of the coulomb interaction , @xmath36 is independent of @xmath37 equation  ( 4 ) has two components for each particle corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath3 motions .",
    "we deliberately add an additionally force along the @xmath3 direction represented by a small electric field @xmath38 and a weak damping so that the final equation for @xmath3 is    @xmath39    we chose this form of  damping such that if all electrons cycle with a constant common velocity @xmath4 , the damping force is balanced by @xmath40 the last term in the above equation is just the coulomb repulsion between electrons .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated numerically using a 7/8 order embedded runge - kutta pair with self - adjusted step .",
    "the initial states for the numerical integrations are generated in the following way : the energy of the confined coulomb system is @xmath41 a naive candidate for a minimal - energy initial condition would be one which minimizes the above energy and with all electrons cycling with the same velocity @xmath42 it is straightforward to find this condition by steepest descent quenching and one obtains a translating lattice which approximates an ideal triangular lattice with some edge distortions .",
    "the problem with this condition is that in the presence of the external magnetic field @xmath8 ( which does not appear explicitly in the energy ) , the translating electrons deflect upwards causing a lattice deformation .",
    "we observe , by integrating the equations of motion numerically from this condition with inclusion of the above defined weak dissipation , that the lattice shifts to a different configuration consistent with the presence of magnetic field and with a slightly higher steady state energy .",
    "( notice that we are driving the system , so energy does not have to be constant ) .  an equivalent way to accomplish this same final state",
    "is to seek minimum energy configurations with a certain property : they must describe a uniform motion of the entire system along the @xmath3 direction under a radial magnetic field @xmath8 (",
    "@xmath43 what we are looking for is that the total force acting on each electron be zero    @xmath44    this configuration can be obtained by a steepest descent procedure : we integrate the ( modified ) quenching equation    @xmath45    @xmath46 being the parameter along the quenching path .",
    "the quenched configurations are obtained for various values of the parameter @xmath47 and then used as initial conditions for subsequent molecular dynamical runs .",
    "fig.(2 ) shows a representative configuration obtained with the confinement of eq.(2 ) .",
    "the electrons arrange themselves in an hexagonal lattice slightly distorted by the confinement and magnetic field ( notice that this is a global distortion , not a simple boundary perturbation of a perfect lattice ) .",
    "electrons are projected out with an initial @xmath3 velocity @xmath48 plus small random components along @xmath3 and @xmath1 directions .",
    "various quantities are calculated along the trajectory : the instantaneous rotation rate @xmath49 which is related to the current @xmath50 ; the @xmath3 averaged potential difference between the top and bottom edges : @xmath51 ( hall voltage ) ; and the hall resistance @xmath52 .",
    "all these quantities are function of time and hence their time - development is likely to be informative .",
    "we also observe snapshots of the system at regular intervals .",
    "these snapshots could be folded to @xmath53 or left unfolded to preserve information about angular motion .",
    "we report the results of the simulations of @xmath54 and 484 particles performed with the confining potential of eqs ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "we distinguish between runs carried out with @xmath55 zero and nonzero .",
    "simulations with nonzero @xmath55 reach a steady state after a brief transient which , is not attained by zero @xmath55 runs .",
    "we henceforth call this state a perfectly translating lattice ( ptl ) . in the ptl state the electrons cycle with a common constant @xmath3 velocity @xmath48 ; motion along @xmath1 being rapidly damped out .",
    "the resulting hall resistance @xmath56 should be a constant in such circumstances but we observe small fluctuations in @xmath57 .",
    "the amplitude of these fluctuations is an irregular function of @xmath58 generally varying between 0.1 - 1.0 percent .",
    "the presence of fluctuating @xmath59 is not disquieting however and can be understood as an artifact of the method employed to calculate hall resistance of small finite number of electrons : because we used a finite number of points to average the potential difference , small instantaneous fluctuations are generated if the number of electrons is small and we verify that the fluctuations become smaller for larger @xmath6 ( number of electrons ) .",
    "two cases can be further differentiated with regard to the initial phase of the dynamics .",
    "initial configuration for certain values of the external magnetic field @xmath8 turns out to be dynamically unstable .",
    "the system makes a transition to a new configuration through coordinated row - jumping of many electrons simultaneously .",
    "such a transition is made possible by the existence of numerous local minima in the energy surface whose presence has been confirmed numerically by extensive quenching runs starting from distinct initial conditions .",
    "the instability only appears for scaled magnetic fields greater than 7.0 for @xmath54 and 8.5 for @xmath60 ( for electron density of @xmath61 @xmath34 these fields correspond to 1.9 t and 2.3 t respectively ) . in a way",
    ", this result shows that the initial state found by minimization ceased to be stable and another extremum ( not the minimum anymore ) of the functional became an stable fixed point , a bifurcation .",
    "this instability is accompanied by slower relaxation to a ptl state and can be seen in fig.(3 ) which plots the spread in the instantaneous rotation rate vs. time .",
    "even more dramatically , velocity inhomogeneities are developed if all electrons are released with a common velocity @xmath4 with no random components .",
    "these inhomogeneities are not long lasting and ultimately a ptl is attained .",
    "the resultant of this temporarily existing velocity profile can be visualized most easily in fig.(4 ) where the @xmath3 coordinates have not been folded to @xmath62 .",
    "this striking profile is not apparent after folding and the finally established ptls do not differ from ptls in cases where this instability is absent .",
    "we call this instability a _ shearing _ instability since it is visible as a shear in the velocity profile of the electrons .",
    "this shear is seen as a dispersion in unfolded lattice along @xmath63 coordinate .",
    "we have carried out runs without forcing and dissipation i.e. @xmath64 and these do not achieve a ptl state .",
    "they may or may not display the initial shearing instability but in all cases the initial randomness in velocity distribution is magnified and the @xmath1 dynamics is not damped .",
    "an irregular velocity distribution develops even from a perfectly homogeneous initial velocity distribution .",
    "the instantaneous hall resistance @xmath65 is unsteady with large amplitude fluctuations and the system can not be said to be in a hall regime .    from these simulations",
    "a plot of the hall resistance @xmath56 vs. @xmath8 can be drawn",
    ". only converged values of @xmath56 are used which rules out our undriven simulations ( @xmath64 ) . in fig.(5 ) results from unsheared and sheared states are displayed for @xmath54 and 484 .",
    "data from the simulations employing confining potential of equation  ( 3 ) has been plotted for @xmath54 also .",
    "all are ptl configurations but the sheared states have experienced the shearing instability referred to earlier .",
    "we observe that @xmath56 from the unsheared states lie on straight lines though different slopes are obtained for the two confining potentials used : 1.07 and 1.05 for potential ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively .",
    "data for @xmath54 and 484 overlap .",
    "points from the sheared states are scattered haphazardly about this straight line .",
    "how far do these data match our expectations ?",
    "a plausible argument can be made for reasonableness of our simulation results : the hall voltage @xmath51 is the difference between the top and the bottom edges of the stripe and may be expressed as    @xmath66    where @xmath67 and the integral is taken along a straight line from bottom to the top edge ; @xmath68 is the distance of the @xmath69th electron from integration element . now",
    "the integrand may be split as    @xmath70    where @xmath32 labels the electron nearest to the integration element and @xmath71 is the unit vector along @xmath1 direction .",
    "this follows from the assuming that the force - balance condition ( eq .  9 ) holds in a neighborhood of the electron nearest to 0 :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 label electrons .",
    "this equation holds only at the position of an electron and we use as an approximate equality in a neighborhood of the nearest point @xmath74 . from the above it follows",
    "@xmath75    the first term on the right yields the straight line dependence of @xmath56 vs. @xmath8 with a unit slope but the second term provides a correction . to evaluate this correction",
    ", we take an integration path passing through a column of electrons , avoiding each electrons by making a small semi - circle around it .",
    "if the distance between the @xmath11th and @xmath76th electrons along this path is @xmath77 , this correction evaluates to @xmath78 hence the correction to the unit slope depends on the degree of compression that the lattice undergoes under the external magnetic field .",
    "a 3d lattice does not suffer this kind of bulk squishing but only edge distortions .",
    "if the lattice rearrangement is global in the sense that lattice distances are affected throughout the bulk and not just at the edges then we can fairly expect a significant alteration of the slope of hall resistance plot .",
    "this expectation is realized in our simulations as we have seen that the slopes of @xmath56 vs @xmath8 plot indeed differ from unity by a few percent .",
    "lattices which are dynamically unstable and undergo rearrangement via the shearing instability would seem to require more correction according to this picture and in fact provide a needed check for the theory .",
    "in conclusion we have performed dynamical  simulations on a 2deg constrained to a cylindrical stripe and subject to crossed electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the classical confined electron gas has a natural non - trivial minimal energy state and provides a convenient test bed to study many - body dynamics and long - range effects . in this work",
    "we included many - body effects on the dynamical picture used in the classical derivations of the hall effect in two dimensional systems .",
    "we have analyzed the formation of the steady state presupposed in classical derivations .",
    "this state , which we refer to as a perfectly translating lattice ( ptl ) , in which all electrons cycle with a common constant velocity , is formed by a relaxation process .",
    "the initial configurations are obtained by a generalized quenching procedure .",
    "this initial configuration is liable to be dynamically unstable for magnetic fields above a threshold .",
    "the quenching procedure sometimes yields rather shallow local minima which readily allow further rearrangements to nearby wide basins .",
    "the inter - basin like motion is manifested in simultaneous jumping of many electrons and a slower relaxation to ptl state .",
    "the hall resistance @xmath56 can be calculated and plotted as a function of external magnetic field @xmath79 appropriately for ptl states @xmath56 is a linear function of @xmath8 except for sheared states .",
    "an explanation has been put forward based upon force - balance condition as it obtains for ptl states .",
    "if one repeated the same study for a confined 3d electron - gas , the minimal energy state would be a tridimensional wigner lattice and inclusion of a drift velocity in the presence of an external magnetic field would produce only boundary charge rearrangement .",
    "the obtained ptl would be the same ideal wigner lattice and there would be no many - body correction to the hall coefficient .",
    "our results are specific to 2d classical systems .",
    "the present work evolved from our earlier attempts to study the same problem but with the electrons interacting via the darwin lagrangian , which is the first relativistic correction to the coulomb interaction .",
    "we find that the relativistic corrections break the scale - invariance of the coulomb interaction , even in the absence of a magnetic field , only by requiring a critical density of the electron gas@xcite .",
    "even though these is a much richer dynamical system , we did not continue the studies because the equations of motion are algebraic - differential and become impossible to integrate above the critical density even by use of the modern specialized integrators radau @xciteand dassl @xcite .",
