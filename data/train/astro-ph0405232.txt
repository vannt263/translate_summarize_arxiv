    "in the past decade the study of cosmology has taken its first major steps as a precise empirical science , combining concepts and tools from astrophysics and particle physics .",
    "the most recent of these results have already brought surprises .",
    "the universe s expansion is apparently accelerating rather than decelerating as expected due to the gravitational attraction of matter .",
    "this implies that the flat , matter - dominated model for the universe does not apply and that our current fundamental physics understanding of particles , forces , and fields is likely to be incomplete .",
    "this evidence for a vacuum energy , or more generally a negative - pressure component called `` dark energy '' , comes from the supernova measurements of changes in the universe s expansion rate that directly show the acceleration .",
    "figure  [ confcmbclust ] shows the results of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which compare the standardized brightnesses of ground and space - observed high - redshift ( @xmath10 ) type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) with a large sample of low - redshift sne  ia @xcite .",
    "the data implies that for a flat universe a fraction @xmath11 of the critical density would reside in a cosmological constant .",
    "more generally , these measurements indicate the presence of a new , unknown energy component with energy density @xmath12 that can cause acceleration , hence having an equation of state ( ratio of pressure to energy density @xcite ) with @xmath13 .",
    "the evidence for dark energy has received strong corroboration from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) results @xcite which are sensitive to the total energy density , combined with galaxy power spectrum and cluster abundance measurements @xcite which probe the matter density @xmath14 , or with an @xmath15 prior ( see figure  [ confcmbclust ] ) .",
    "two of these three independent measurements would have to be in error to make dark energy unnecessary in the cosmological model .",
    "the dark energy might be due to the cosmological constant term in einstein s equations , which implies vacuum energy with @xmath16 .",
    "alternatively , it could be due to a dynamical scalar field with @xmath17 and/or time - varying @xmath18 .",
    "the fundamental importance of a universal vacuum energy has sparked a flurry of activity in theoretical physics with several classes of models being proposed ( e.g. quintessence @xcite , pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) models @xcite , cosmic defects @xcite , and modified gravity @xcite .",
    "all these models explaining the accelerating universe have observational consequences for the supernova hubble diagram @xcite .",
    "the luminosity distance as a function of redshift can for convenience be parameterized to first order with effective dark - energy parameters , e.g.  @xmath19 , or @xmath6 , @xmath20 .",
    "a constant @xmath19 can represent dark - energy models such as the cosmological constant while @xmath21 is successful at describing a wide variety of both scalar field and more general models @xcite .",
    "predictions of dark - energy models can be either compared directly to supernova hubble diagrams or to the dark - energy parameters as fit by the data .",
    "placing some constraints on possible dark - energy models , @xcite find that for a flat universe , the data are consistent with a cosmological - constant equation of state and @xmath22 ( figure  [ wconf ] ) , or generally @xmath23 at 95% confidence level .",
    "when combining supernova with other results , such as from a variety of cmb experiments and large - scale - structure measurements@xcite , @xcite find @xmath24 ( @xmath25 systematics ) and @xcite get @xmath26 .",
    "cosmic strings ( @xmath27 ) are already ruled out as dark energy , while the domain walls ( @xmath28 ) and tracking quintessence models ( @xmath29 ) are disfavored .",
    "current and upcoming ground - based supernova experiments will continue to improve measurements of the dynamical effects of the dark energy .",
    "for example , the nearby supernova factory @xcite will produce a photometrically calibrated spectral time - series for hundreds of @xmath30 supernovae , providing a rich data set for refining our understanding of sn ia behavior .",
    "the snls and essence projects will discover and follow hundreds of supernovae to @xmath31 mag accuracy in the range @xmath32 , giving significantly tighter constraints on the value of @xmath19 .",
    "unfortunately once the assumption that @xmath18 is constant is relaxed , these experiments are not able to provide strong constraints on @xmath6 nor @xmath9 @xcite . testing the nature of dark energy will thus be difficult with these experiments .",
    "a new experiment is then necessary to study the properties and possible models for the dark energy , and refine the measurement of the matter and dark energy densities of the universe . since the discovery of cosmic acceleration in 1998 , many observational approaches to dark energy have been proposed ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the most well developed and understood method of constructing the expansion history of the universe is the same one that led to the discovery of dark energy : the measurement of the supernova hubble diagram .",
    "the systematic and statistical uncertainties in current sn ia measurements are on the same order of magnitude : any new experiment to perform precision cosmology must eliminate or significantly reduce the influence of the systematic uncertainties while discovering and measuring high - quality light curves and spectra of a statistically large number of supernovae .    in this paper",
    "we describe the supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) , a dedicated satellite mission designed to measure the properties of dark energy .",
    "originally conceived in 1999 @xcite , the snap concept has progressed through a series of refinements all starting with science requirements and then deriving observational , instrumental , and mission requirements . the snap reference mission is presented in this paper in the form of a spacecraft , orbit , telescope , imager , spectrograph , and observation strategy .",
    "this mission serves as a reference from which future optimization studies will be performed and is a demonstration of a design that can realistically accomplish the science goals .",
    "it is self - consistent , technically feasible , reduces risk , and is specifically designed to provide data that strictly control statistical and systematic uncertainties for supernova and weak gravitational lensing science .",
    "snap can run as a complete supernova experiment providing discovery , and photometric and spectroscopic followup of a full sample of supernovae over the target redshifts .",
    "snap is also an excellent platform for performing deep wide - field surveys with space - quality imaging providing crucial complementary constraints to study dark energy from weak lensing and other studies .",
    "snap s full potential is realized when used in conjunction with complementary results that are anticipated by the time snap launches : a large sample of well - measured low - redshift sne ia and precise measurements of the distance to the surface of last scattering from the planck satellite .    in  [",
    "dataset : sec ] we describe the precision cosmology that can be achieved using type ia supernovae .",
    "the needed supernova data set is based on the identification of known or plausible systematic uncertainties that fundamentally limit measurement accuracy , and on the number and redshift range of supernovae necessary to probe precisely the dark - energy parameters .",
    "the power of weak gravitational lensing surveys in measuring cosmological parameters is discussed in  [ lensing : sec ] and the added complementarity of lensing and other dark - energy probes made possible with snap data is described in  [ otherde : sec ] .",
    "we present in  [ proposed_experiment ] the observing strategies and instrumentation suite tailored to provide the data that satisfy both the statistical and systematic requirements for the supernova and lensing surveys .",

    "ancsci : sec ] we discuss the general properties of the snap surveys and the science resources they will provide .",
    "type ia sne have already proved to be excellent distance indicators for probing the dynamics of the universe .",
    "however , the current supernova cosmology measurements are limited by systematic uncertainties ( which occur for all cosmological probes ) . in order to move toward the era of precision cosmology ,",
    "a new data set must both address potential systematic uncertainties and provide sufficient statistical power to accurately determine dark - energy properties , especially the time variation of the equation of state . because control of systematic uncertainties is so central we begin with aspects of the data set necessary for their control .",
    "we proceed by listing the sources of systematic uncertainty , strategies to reduce their effects , and the resulting improvements that can be obtained in measuring the supernova hubble diagram .",
    "we then determine which supernova observations give a statistical uncertainty comparable to the systematic uncertainty , leading to requirements on the number of supernovae we need to find , their distribution in redshift , and how precisely we need to determine each one s peak brightness .",
    "high - redshift supernova searches have been proceeding since the late 1980 s @xcite . particularly since the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe , the high - redshift supernova methodology for measuring cosmological parameters has been critically scrutinized for sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "below are identified systematic effects which any experiment aiming to make maximal use of the supernova technique will need to recognize and control .",
    "we also give a rough estimate of the expected _ systematic _ residual in supernova magnitude after statistical correction for such effects with the snap data set or from independent data sets from other astrophysical studies .",
    "_ extinction by host - galaxy `` normal '' dust : _ extinction from host - galaxy dust can significantly reduce the observed brightness of a discovered supernova although typically type ia supernovae suffer only modest extinction @xcite .",
    "cross - wavelength flux - calibrated spectra and multi - band photometry will identify the properties of the obscuring dust and gas and the amount of extinction suffered by individual supernovae .",
    "there will remain a residual uncertainty proportional to the calculated extinction due to dust - model dependence .",
    "this can be minimized by excluding highly - extincted supernovae from the analysis .",
    "stringent requirements on the snap calibration system are needed to control uncertainties in the photometric - system zeropoints , particularly since the uncertainties are correlated from supernova to supernova .",
    "our calibration program is being designed to control extinction uncertainty to 1% .",

    "since flux is conserved in this process , averaging large numbers of supernovae per redshift bin will give the correct mean brightness .",
    "deviations from a gaussian distribution for the brightness of supernovae at similar @xmath34 can be used to determine the clumpiness of the intervening mass distribution @xcite .",
    "the large snap supernova sample will reduce the distance modulus uncertainty per redshift bin to @xmath35% . snap weak gravitational lensing measurements , and micro - lensing studies can further help distinguish whether or not the matter is in compact objects .    _ k - correction and cross - filter calibration : _ broadband photometry of supernovae at different redshifts is sensitive to differing supernova - rest - frame spectral regions .",
    "k - corrections are used to put these differing photometry measurements onto a consistent rest - frame passband @xcite . applying k - corrections with only today s methods and calibration sets",
    "could produce errors of several percent . using the currently available spectra",
    ", we tune the snap filter - set specifications to give the target systematic uncertainty @xmath36 mag .",
    "( the situation will improve even further as the spectral library of supernovae grows and snap itself will add to this library . ) furthermore , strict requirements are placed on the snap calibration program to ensure accurate transformations of fluxes between filters .    _ galactic extinction : _ extinction maps of our own galaxy are uncertain by @xmath33 110% depending on direction @xcite .",
    "supernova fields can be chosen toward the low extinction galactic caps .",
    "future spitzer observations will allow an improved mapping between color excesses ( e.g.  of galactic halo subdwarfs in the snap field ) and galactic extinction by dust .",
    "galactic - extinction uncertainty can then be controlled to @xmath37% in brightness .",
    "_ non - sn ia contamination : _ other supernova types are on average fainter than sne ia and their contamination could bias their hubble diagram . observed supernovae must be positively identified as sn  ia .",
    "as some type  ib and ic supernovae have spectra and brightnesses that otherwise mimic those of sne  ia , a spectrum covering the defining rest frame si  ii 6150  feature for every supernova at maximum will provide a pure sample .",
    "this systematic would then be eliminated .",
    "_ malmquist bias : _ a flux - limited sample preferentially detects the intrinsically brighter members of any population of sources .",
    "the amount of magnitude bias depends on details of the search but can reach the level of the intrinsic magnitude dispersion of a standard candle . directly correcting this bias would rely on knowledge of the sn ia luminosity function , which may change with lookback time .",
    "a detection threshold fainter than peak by at least five times the intrinsic sn  ia luminosity dispersion ensures sample completeness with respect to intrinsic supernova brightness , eliminating this bias @xcite .      a systematics - limited experiment must account for speculative but reasonable sources of uncertainty .",
    "the following are sources of systematic uncertainty for which there is no direct evidence but which can not yet be discounted .",
    "as opposed to normal dust , gray dust is postulated to produce wavelength - independent absorption in optical bands @xcite . although models for gray - dust grains dim blue and red optical light equally , the near - infrared ( nir ) light ( @xmath331 - 2 @xmath38 m ) is less affected .",
    "cross - wavelength calibrated spectra extending to wavelength regions where `` gray '' dust is no longer gray will characterize the hypothetical large - grain dust s absorption properties .",
    "armed with the extinction  color excess properties of the gray dust , broadband near - infrared colors can provide `` gray '' dust extinction corrections for supernovae out to @xmath39 ; @xcite have explored the observations necessary to be sensitive to 0.02 mag gray - dust extinction .",
    "gray dust will re - emit absorbed starlight and thus contribute to the far - infrared background ; current observations indicate that the fir flux is attributable to point sources @xcite .",
    "quasar colors in the sdss sample as a function of redshift give an upper limit to the possible dimming due to gray dust at the level of 0.2 mag ( in the restframe b - band ) at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "deeper scuba and spitzer observations should further tighten the constraints on the amount of gray dust allowed .",
    "supernova behavior itself may have systematic variations depending , for example , on properties of the progenitor systems .",
    "the distribution of these stellar properties is likely to change over time``evolve''in a given galaxy , and over a population of galaxies .",
    "supernova heterogeneity manifests itself through observed signatures in their spectral light emission ( the bulk emitted in optical wavelengths ) , and the time - evolution of that emission .",
    "signs of supernova diversity are thus captured in observations of multi - band light curves and/or spectral time - sequences that begin shortly after explosion and extend to the nebular phase of the event .",
    "this has been done using optical measurements of nearby sne  ia drawn from a wide range of galactic environments that provide an observed evolutionary range of sne  ia @xcite .",
    "the photometric and spectral differences that have been identified in these data are well calibrated by the sn  ia light curve width - luminosity relation , leaving a 10% intrinsic peak - brightness dispersion .",
    "there is currently no evidence for systematic residuals after correction , for example with galaxy type or supernova location @xcite .",
    "high signal - to - noise ( @xmath41 ) multi - band light curves and spectra over optical wavelengths can provide precise control over additional general supernova variability .",
    "efforts are underway to expose additional effects using larger , more precise and systematic , low - redshift supernova surveys @xcite",
    ". these high - quality data are also necessary to control possible evolution effects when performing precision cosmology with high - redshift supernovae .",
    "theoretical models can identify observables that are expected to display heterogeneity .",
    "these key features , indicative of the underlying initial conditions and physical mechanisms controlling the supernova , will be measured with snap , allowing statistical correction for what would otherwise be a systematic uncertainty .",
    "the state of empirical understanding of these observables at the time snap launches will be explicitly tested by snap measurements @xcite . at present",
    ", we perform fisher matrix analyses on model spectra and light curves to estimate the statistical measurement requirements , and to ensure that we have necessary sensitivity to use subsamples to test for residual systematics at better than the 2% level .",
    "this approach reveals the main effects of  as well as the covariance between  the following observables :    _ rise time from explosion to peak : _ this is an indicator of opacity , fused @xmath42ni mass , and possible differences in the @xmath42ni distribution .",
    "a 0.1  day uncertainty corresponds to a 1% brightness constraint at peak @xcite .",

    "current constraints on rise - time differences are two days @xcite .",
    "_ plateau level 45 days past peak : _ the light - curve plateau level that begins @xmath3345 days past  and more than 10@xmath43 fainter than  peak is an important indicator of the c / o ratio of the progenitor star , and fused @xmath42ni . in models ,",
    "a 5% constraint on this plateau brightness corresponds to a 1% constraint on the peak brightness @xcite .",
    "_ overall light - curve timescale : _ the `` stretch factor '' ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) that parameterizes the light - curve timescale @xcite is affected by almost all of the aforementioned parameters since it tracks the sn  ia s light - curve development from early to late times .",
    "it is correlated with rise time and plateau level and it ties snap s controls for systematics to the controls used in the current ground - based work .",
    "a 0.5% uncertainty in the stretch factor measurement corresponds to a @xmath331% uncertainty at peak @xcite .",

    "spectral features in the restframe optical ( ca  ii h&k and si  ii at 6150  ) provide additional constraints on the opacity and luminosity of the sn  ia @xcite .    figures  [ syslc : fig ] and [ sysspec : fig ] show the particular light - curve and spectral parameters that can serve as indicators of supernova evolution . by measuring all of the above features for each supernova we can tightly constrain the physical conditions of the explosion .",
    "this makes it possible to recognize subsets of supernovae with matching initial conditions , ensuring a small luminosity range for each subset .",
    "in addition to these features of the supernovae themselves , we will also study the host galaxy of the supernova .",
    "we can measure the host galaxy luminosity , colors , morphology , and the location of the supernova within the galaxy , even at redshifts @xmath45 .",
    "the last two observations are difficult or impossible from the ground for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "these galaxy properties can provide clues to any shifts with redshift in the supernova progenitor population .",
    "the behavior of systematic uncertainties are complicated and the determination of their propagated effects on cosmology requires rigorous analysis @xcite .",
    "particularly important systematic effects for supernova - cosmology experiments are those that put a floor on how well the distance modulus can be measured in a certain redshift bin .",
    "for example , supernovae at similar redshifts whose rest - frame flux regions lie in common observer passbands can share completely correlated calibration uncertainty .",
    "an increase in the statistical sample of supernovae can not decrease this uncertainty .",
    "in addition , these uncertainties could be correlated across redshift bins . again taking calibration as an example , a temperature uncertainty in a blackbody fundamental calibrator propagates into correlated flux and magnitude zeropoint uncertainties .",
    "correlated errors across redshift bins can lead to a bias in the determination of the cosmological and dark - energy parameters .",
    "we do not further consider correlated bias in this paper as @xcite find that the systematic bias in @xmath6 and @xmath9 lies well within the 68%-error contours due to comparably - sized irreducible systematic uncertainties .    for convenience",
    "we adopt in this paper a systematic - uncertainty model of @xmath46 magnitude irreducible uncertainty per redshift bin of width 0.1 as proposed by @xcite , where @xmath47 represents the depth of the survey . the systematic uncertainty introduced in the comparison of high - redshift supernovae with the local sample",
    "is an increasing function of redshift .",
    "systematic uncertainty will exist at some level even for the local sample , due for example to uncertainty in the galactic - extinction zeropoint and spatial correlations in @xmath48 maps .",
    "the subtyping strategy employed for evolution based on observables tied to the explosion characteristics can be more generally applied .",
    "the data ( supernova risetime , early detection , light - curve peak - to - tail ratio , identification of the type ia - defining si ii spectral feature , separation of supernova light from host - galaxy light , and identification of host - galaxy morphology , etc . ) make it possible to study each individual supernova and measure enough of its physical properties to recognize deviations from standard brightness subtypes",
    ". only the change in brightness as a function of the parameters classifying a subtype is needed , not any intrinsic brightness .",
    "supernovae can not change their brightness in one measured wavelength range without affecting brightness somewhere else in the spectral time series  an effect that is well - captured by expanding atmosphere computer models .    as a precision experiment snap",
    "is designed to distinguish supernovae `` demographics '' by detecting subtle variations in light - curve and spectral parameters . by matching like to like among the supernova subtypes",
    "we can construct independent hubble diagrams , each with systematic biases reduced to the level of 1% in distance .",

    "thus , a subset , or `` like vs.  like '' , analysis based on physical conditions should group supernovae to within @xmath502% in luminosity .",

    "the high spatial density of resolved background galaxies afforded by space - based observations allows cross - correlation measurements and gives measurements of the mass power spectrum at scales where non - linearities are most apparent .",

    "the strengths that make snap excellent for supernova observations apply to lensing as well ; a wide - field imager in space with stable and narrow point - spread - functions can provide large survey areas , accurate shape measurements , and high galaxy angular - surface densities .",
    "the nine optical and near infrared filters are necessary for accurate photometric redshift determinations .",

    "the reference snap deep survey will exceed even this density requirement by a factor of three @xcite .",

    "it is nonetheless important to explore the resulting distortion quantitatively .",
    "the telescope mirror assembly ( tma ) distortion is axisymmetric owing to the symmetry of the unfolded ( powered ) optical train , and in polar coordinates any off - axis angle maps onto a single focal plane radius independent of azimuth angle .",
    "the distortion is therefore purely radial .",
    "column 6 of table  [ moment : tab ] lists the radial distance of an off - axis field point as a function of the sine of the off - axis angle , and the departure from proportionality to the sine of that angle .",
    "the tma distortion is of the pincushion type , having increased magnification toward the extremity of the field .",

    "the primary concern is sunlight scattered past the forward edge of the outer light baffle .",

    "a systems engineering approach is being pursued , along with development of a detailed stray light budget for both solar and stellar contamination sources .",
    "the departure of any surface from its nominal mathematical conic section or the misplacement or misorientation of any of the surfaces causes a wavefront error and a degraded image quality .",
    "one measure of this degradation is the telescope s strehl ratio .",
    "the strehl ratio can be converted into rms wavefront error ( rms wfe ) through marechal s relation . to achieve a system strehl ratio of 0.77 at 0.633 @xmath38 m wavelength ,",

    "a tolerance budget has been developed based on a group of exploratory studies of the sensitivity of the geometrical spot size to variations in element curvature , shape , location , and orientation .",
    "these calculations show that by far the single most critical parameters are the primary mirror curvature and the spacing between primary and secondary mirrors expected given the fast ( @xmath121 ) primary mirror . a two - micron displacement of the secondary piston , or a two - micron displacement in the virtual image created by the primary mirror is found to increase the rms geometrical blur by about 3 @xmath38 m .",
    "similarly , a 15-@xmath38 m lateral displacement or a 15-microradian tilt of the secondary mirror causes a 3-@xmath38 m growth in the rms geometrical blur .",
    "the reference model snap telescope includes on - orbit mechanical adjustments that permit the relocation and reorientation of the secondary mirror , and possibly the tertiary mirror as well , to optimize image quality . by means of these adjustments we anticipate accommodating small shifts in any of the optical elements locations and orientations , allowing for correction of geometrical blur .",

    "<S> can be measured to an even tighter uncertainty of 0.03 and 0.06 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that no external priors are needed . as more accurate theoretical predictions for the small - scale weak - lensing shear develop , the conservative estimates adopted here for space - based systematics should improve , allowing even tighter constraints . while the survey strategy is tailored for supernova and weak gravitational lensing observations , the large survey area , depth , spatial resolution , time - sampling , and nine - band optical to nir photometry will support additional independent and/or complementary dark - energy measurement approaches as well as a broad range of auxiliary science programs . </S>"
