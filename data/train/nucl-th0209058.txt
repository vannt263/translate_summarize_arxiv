    "a major aim of electron scattering experiment on few - body systems is to validate the ingredients entering the description of the process .",
    "these include the nn interaction models and the associated currents . with this respect ,",
    "the recent measurements of the deuteron form factors at jlab @xcite represent a valuable information .",
    "the interpretation of these data is not an easy one however .",
    "there are uncertainties on the nucleon form factors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the effect of relativistic corrections , which begin to show up in the explored @xmath1 range , is approach dependent for a part which is not negligeable @xcite .",
    "some genuine effects , due to two - pion exchange , to an underlying quark structure of the constituents , to the field - theory foundation of the interaction ... , are expected to show up but they are likely to be mixed with other ones . moreover , within a given scheme ( corresponding to some equation for instance ) , nn interaction models , seemingly different , may represent the same physics .",
    "this involves different non - localities as expected from phase - shift equivalent potentials obtained by unitary transformations .",
    "as is well known , within a non - relativistic approach , it is always possible to describe the nn interaction below the meson - production threshold by a local potential for each partial wave separately .",
    "however , theoretically , the interaction is expected to be non - local .",
    "this observation motivated a recent study on the role of the non - locality , essentially on a phenomenological basis @xcite .",
    "the non - locality in interaction models has many sources and often results from accounting for a theoretical ingredient , explaining that it is not always emphasized by the authors .",
    "part of it originates from relativistic corrections ( @xmath2 factors , structure of dirac spinors ) .",
    "it has been considered in bonn models @xcite and is sometimes approximated by linearly @xmath3 dependent terms which makes them tractable in configuration space ( paris @xcite , bonn - r @xcite and nijmegen @xcite models ) .",
    "another part comes from the coupling of the dominant nn channel to other ones , @xmath4 or @xmath5 components . in these cases , the original time non",
    "- locality is transformed into a spatial one .",
    "this non - locality is not explicitly present in the models ( except of course for the energy - dependent ones , full - bonn for instance ) but may be accounted for in the fitted parameters .",
    "finally , the compositeness of the nucleon or the exchanged meson can also produce some non - locality .",
    "it is explicit in quark based calculations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent work together with earlier references ) but , most often , as in the previous case , it is hidden in the parametrization of the potential model .    while different non - localities are present in various models , it is not clear whether it helps in describing the nn interaction",
    ". these local and non - local models may be as many different models , in which case discriminating between them is important .",
    "one can not exclude however that they represent the same physics for some part . in this case , there is not so much to study at the nn level and , most probably , one should look at other observables . in the example of form factors ,",
    "a preferred model would require less corrections from two - body currents beside the genuine ones .",
    "the possibility to have different models representing the same physics was discussed in the past by friar @xcite . for a long time , it was just a curiosity till it was realized that more accurate models , namely paris @xcite and bonn - qb @xcite , could realize to some extent this conjecture @xcite .",
    "terms under consideration have an off - shell character and mainly concern the tensor component of the interaction . when these models were used with the corresponding currents , it turned out that the discrepancies between the predictions for electromagnetic observables tend to decrease .",
    "some was left however at the same time that some difference in the deuteron d - state probability was unexplained .",
    "it was mentioned in refs .",
    "@xcite that some role could be played by terms which have the form of an anticommutator of the kinetic energy with a tensor operator , @xmath6 .",
    "interestingly , von geramb et al .",
    "@xcite , using inverse scattering methods , were able to derive local equivalent potentials for the two paris and bonn - qb models , evidencing very close deuteron d - state probabilities , suggesting that the above term could also be important in making the predictions of the two models closer to each other .",
    "these results largely motivate the present paper .    besides non - local contributions of the type , @xmath7 , which have been studied in a previous paper and later on by de forest @xcite",
    ", we therefore consider non - local contributions of the type , @xmath8 . as in the other case",
    ", @xmath9 can have a scalar as well as a tensor component .",
    "the first one may originate from overall relativistic @xmath2 normalization factors @xcite , mostly ignored in non - relativistic approaches . due to the cancellation between the attractive and the repulsive components of the force due to @xmath10 and @xmath11 exchanges ,",
    "its effect is not expected to be very large .",
    "a larger effect may be due to the different lorentz structures of these couplings , implying that the @xmath3 corrections to each of them add together instead of cancelling .",
    "the effect , which in relativistic mean - field approaches tends to decrease the @xmath12 exchange contribution has a net repulsion .",
    "it is part of many models @xcite and we believe that it is theoretically relevant .",
    "its size is not well known however and , as far as we can see , there was no systematic attempt until now to look for an optimized strength .",
    "perhaps , a reason for this is that such a term can always be transformed away by a unitary transformation as we recalled .",
    "if it has some relevance , one should expect that a smaller number of parameters be necessary to fit the same body of data .",
    "an indication in this sense is given by the comparison of the two nijmegen models , nij1 and nij2 @xcite . approximately based on the same philosophy ( vertex form factors , ... ) , but differing by a linearly @xmath0 dependent term , they reproduce equally well nn scattering data ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the first one , which is non - local , requires however less parameters ( 41 instead of 47 ) .",
    "the non - local component with a tensor character is primarily due to the pion exchange .",
    "this is a well established one as far as the long - range force is concerned .",
    "when studying the effect of non - local terms of the form , @xmath8 , we will consider a transformation up to first order in the interaction .",
    "contrary to off - shell effects generated by the terms , @xmath7 , the determination of the unitary transformation at the lowest order is not straightforward .",
    "it requires to solve an integral equation , which can only be performed numerically .",
    "when this is done , it is possible to calculate the effect on observables and see whether such terms can explain discrepancies between models evidencing different non - localities .",
    "this concerns the comparison between models . for our purpose , it is not necessary to look at the corrections to the interaction model which result from eliminating some non - locality .",
    "we assume that the fit of the model to scattering data has accounted for them , at least to a good approximation .",
    "we nevertheless notice that such corrections were explicitly considered in the past ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent work ) . ultimately , one is interested in a comparison with experiment . with this last respect",
    ", the previous comparison may be useful to discriminate between effects that are simply due to the mathematical representation of the model and those due to genuine aspects such as a two - pion - exchange contribution @xcite , the choice of the strong @xmath14 coupling @xcite , ...    the plan of the paper will be as follows . in the second section",
    ", we present the non - local terms considered in this work and show how they can be transformed away by a unitary transformation at the lowest order .",
    "this involves two terms with a scalar and a tensor character .",
    "the effect on wave functions is discussed in the third section for the deuteron case , including both its s and d state components .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to the effect on the deuteron form factors and the structure functions , @xmath15 and @xmath16 as well as the tensor polarization , @xmath17 .",
    "this part incorporates effects with an off - shell character described in an earlier work .",
    "comparison of predictions for different interaction models is made when correcting them for a difference in their non - locality .",
    "a few cases where the discrepancy between predictions is not explained , and sometimes enhanced , are examined . a discussion and a conclusion are given in the fifth section .",
    "non - locality can be produced by various contributions to the interaction .",
    "that one we are considering here originates from an expansion of the spinors entering the meson - exchange interaction .",
    "the part , which is by far the best identified , is due to the pion exchange . its center of mass expression ,",
    "up to first order terms in @xmath18 , is given by :    @xmath19    the above equation may be written as : @xmath20 , \\label{2e2}\\ ] ] it can be extended to the exchange of other mesons : @xmath21 . \\label{2e3}\\ ] ] in the above expression , @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be expanded in such a way to exhibit their spin - isospin structure . in configuration space , they would read : @xmath24 where the operators @xmath25 represent the projectors on different spin and isospin channels .",
    "the spin tensor operator , shortly written @xmath26 , is defined as @xmath27 .",
    "together with this definition , we write the deuteron wave function as @xmath28\\;|^3s_1>$ ] . working with states of given spin and isospin ,",
    "these projectors can be omitted as well as the corresponding indices .",
    "the spin - tensor operator can not be however . without loss of generality",
    ", we can therefore make the replacements : @xmath29    the two first terms in eq .",
    "( [ 2e3 ] ) , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , represent the standard scalar and tensor parts of the non - relativistic interaction .",
    "these terms are local and are present in all interaction models .",
    "they differ by the precise value of the coupling constant , @xmath32 , and the expression of the hadronic form factor .",
    "this one is taken as 1 like in the reid models or assumes a more realistic form like in most other models .",
    "the potentials that only retain the two first terms at the r.h.s . of eqs .",
    "( [ 2e2 ] , [ 2e3 ] ) are considered as local ones .",
    "they in particular include the so - called rsc@xcite , reid93 , nij2 @xcite and argonne v18 @xcite models that will be evoked in this work .",
    "they are denoted here as type - i models .",
    "the so - called paris @xcite , nij1 and nij93 @xcite models contain a minimal non - locality given by a term like the third one in eq .",
    "( [ 2e3 ] ) . partly justified by its appearance at the first order in @xmath18 , the limitation to this term",
    "is also motivated by the fact that it can be dealt with relatively easily in configuration space .",
    "these models , like the type - i ones , are generally built in configuration space .",
    "they are denoted as type - ii models .",
    "interestingly , these models tend to show a suppression of the deuteron s - wave at short distances smaller than local models corresponding to a similar description of the short range part of the interaction . an open question is to know whether this can be related to the non - local term proportional to @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ 2e3 ] ) .    a last class of models ( denoted type - iii ) is represented by the bonn ones , qa , qb , qc , cd @xcite .",
    "contrary to the models discussed above , they consider the full structure of the dirac spinors describing on mass - shell nucleons . due to this , these models contain all kinds of non - locality present in eq .",
    "( [ 2e2 ] ) for the simplest pion - exchange case and in eq .",
    "( [ 2e3 ] ) for the most general case .",
    "they in particular involve terms that have an off - shell character and were studied in earlier works @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution was provided by the tensor part of @xmath33 which could explain 2/3 of the difference in the deuteron d - state propabilities evidenced by the comparison of calculations performed with the paris and bonn - qb models .",
    "an open question here , indirectly answered by von geramb @xcite , is to know whether the fourth term in eq . ( [ 2e3 ] ) , @xmath34 , can explain the remaining part .    in comparing models , it is important that they are physically equivalent with respect to nn scattering properties .",
    "the so - called `` high accuracy '' models , nij1 , nij2 , argonne v18 and bonn - cd should therefore retain our attention . concerning effects in relation with the tensor part of the interaction , we will also include the paris and bonn - qb models which were used in a previous work .",
    "these two models provide values for the mixing angle , @xmath35 , which are relatively close to each other on the one hand , and close to the experimental ones on the other .    while the good quality of the fit to nn scattering data is essential to avoid biases in the analysis we are going to perform , the failure to establish some relationship between the various in principle phase - shift equivalent models can have different origin . beyond higher order corrections",
    ", it may reveal a genuine physical effect .",
    "although it can be largely accounted for in the model fitting , the two - pion exchange contribution explicitly incorporated in the paris model could be an example of such an effect .",
    "it may also reveal that some ingredient in a model is , on the contrary , physically irrelevant .",
    "moreover , but not independently , it may suggest that models are not completely determined by scattering data in the range where they are available . looking for possible failures can thus provide information on the underlying physics , which , after all , is the ultimate goal for studying the nn interaction properties . anticipating on the following , this aspect will mainly involve its scalar part . in the next subsections , we show how non - local terms present in eq .",
    "( [ 2e3 ] ) can be transformed away at the lowest order in @xmath18 .",
    "this is done successively for the scalar and tensor components of the interaction .",
    "we will concentrate on the terms that have an anticommutator character , @xmath36 and @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ 2e3 ] ) .",
    "the other terms of the commutator type , @xmath38 $ ] , which are relatively easy to deal with , were discussed elsewhere @xcite .    for definiteness",
    ", we denote by @xmath39 and @xmath40 the two hamiltonians that , in the ideal case , would be related to each other by a unitary transformation : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath39 , will be that one that contains a non - local term , @xmath43 which we want to transform away by making a unitary transformation and @xmath40 will be the resulting hamiltonian .",
    "the two hamiltonians therefore assume the following expressions : @xmath44 when the non - local term , @xmath43 , is transformed away to make it local , the interaction @xmath45 acquires an extra contribution @xmath46 , defined as : @xmath47 starting from a two - body interaction , @xmath46 will generally involve two - body but also many - body contributions . as to the solutions of the hamiltonians , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ,",
    "they are denoted @xmath48 and @xmath49 .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider two models that differ by a non - local term proportional to @xmath50 . the non - local term , @xmath43 , therefore assumes the following expression : @xmath51 the physical origin of the last term in eq .",
    "( [ 2e5 ] ) has been briefly mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the first candidate for such a contribution is provided by the examination of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( 2@xmath52 in a s - state ) exchanges .",
    "the cancellation that occurs for these contributions at the zeroth order in @xmath53 is absent at the order @xmath54 , hence a possible sizeable term . in comparison ,",
    "the contribution due to the pion exchange in eq .",
    "( [ 2e2 ] ) contains extra factors of the order @xmath54 . due to the above cancellation",
    ", minimal relativity factors @xmath2 , whose effect was studied in a first step by elster et al .",
    "@xcite , may only be a part of the dominant contribution .",
    "non - locality could also arise from eliminating degrees of freedom involving mesons in flight or baryons excitations .",
    "it however appears that the corresponding spatial and time non - localities , individually large , tend to cancel each other .",
    "this probably explains the success of a local potential in reproducing the spectrum of the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .    equation ( [ 2ee1 ] ) together with the expression of @xmath43 given by eq .",
    "( [ 2e5 ] ) can not be solved easily but taking into account that the term we want to remove is of order @xmath54 , we can solve it order by order by making an expansion of the unitary transformation that we denote @xmath55 . at the lowest order in the interaction , we have thus to fulfill the following equation : @xmath56= \\delta\\,v_s^0 \\ ; ,   \\label{2e7}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 must be local .",
    "this is achieved by choosing @xmath58 as : @xmath59 where the function @xmath60 satisfies the following first - order differential equation : @xmath61 the solution of this equation is given by the following integral : @xmath62 the integral can be calculated numerically provided that the integrand is not too singular . the singular character of @xmath60 due to the presence of the front factor @xmath63 is partly removed by the presence of the factor , @xmath64 , in the expression of @xmath58 , eq .",
    "( [ 2e8 ] ) .",
    "it is likely that this singular character is the consequence of limiting ourselves to the lowest order terms in both expanding @xmath55 and in the interaction .",
    "it should be removed in a complete calculation but this supposes a fully non - local unitary transformation .    while the non - local term in eq .",
    "( [ 2e3 ] ) is removed at the lowest order , an extra local contribution to the interaction with same order in the coupling constant is generated .",
    "denoted @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ 2e7 ] ) , its expression is given in the appendix .",
    "let s precise here that its locality holds for each partial wave separately , as expected from phase - shift equivalent models . on the other hand , it is somewhat more singular than the interaction models we started from or contains terms with extra powers of @xmath63 . by fitting the model parameters to the scattering",
    "nn data , such terms may be partly accounted for but we do not expect to completely explain the discrepancy between different models , the new terms having a functional form that is generally discarded in building models .",
    "finally , an important difference is to be noticed with the treatment of the non - local term of the commutator type , @xmath66 $ ] , made elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the correction , @xmath67 , contains in the present case a contribution of the first order in the coupling @xmath68 , @xmath69 , while it was of the second order for this other term .    for practical applications",
    ", we will consider the two potential models , nij1 and nij2 , which have been built with approximately the same ingredients , except evidently for the presence of a non - local term in the first one , which has the form of the term considered in this work .",
    "we also considered other couples of models , paris and rsc for instance .",
    "their probing strength as to their possible unitary equivalence was not found very strong . instead , the comparison pointed out to a discrepancy having its source in the different values for the quantities , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( and possibly the ratio @xmath72 ) obtained with these models . some correlation between @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "is well known but a correlation to @xmath73 , which appears to be supported by the examination of various models , is not so .",
    "characterizing the asymptotic behavior , the difference evidenced by the comparison of these values that are observable ones , can not be removed by the unitary transformation considered here .      in this subsection , we consider two models that differ by a non - local tensor term of the anticommutator type : @xmath74 the non - local tensor term of the commutator type has been discussed at length in earlier works @xcite .",
    "to eliminate the non - local term under consideration , we proceed as in the previous subsection , with the same approximations ( expansion of the unitary transformation , now denoted @xmath75 , up to first order in @xmath76 and first - order terms in the interaction retained ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath76 has to be chosen in such a way that its commutator with the kinetic energy term @xmath77 cancels the term @xmath78 without generating the same terms as those we want to remove .",
    "this implies to solve an equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ 2e7 ] ) for the scalar case : @xmath79 = \\delta\\,v_t^0 \\ ; ,   \\label{2e7bis}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 has to be local .",
    "this supposes to take two terms in @xmath76 and is achieved by : @xmath81 the functions , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , have to satisfy the following relations : @xmath84 despite it is more complicated than eq .",
    "( [ 2e9 ] ) , the above system of equations can be formally solved with the result : @xmath85 numerical values for @xmath82 and @xmath83 are then obtained by performing successively the integrations in eqs .",
    "( [ 2e14 ] ) and ( [ 2e15 ] ) . concerning the singularities entering these expressions , the same observations as for @xmath86 can be made here .",
    "similarly to the scalar case , the removal of the non - local tensor term of the anticommutator type generates an extra contribution to the interaction , @xmath87 , with a local character .",
    "its expression is given in the appendix .",
    "again , it evidences an analytic structure different from what is usually included in potential models . a large part of it is certainly accounted for by fitting its parameters to scattering data .",
    "whether the remaining part can show up is probably difficult to answer in view of other uncertainties .",
    "applications will be made for the couple of the paris and bonn - qb models that we considered in a previous work for part of the non - local tensor component with a commutator type , assuming implicitly that non - local scalar terms of the anticommutator type are more or less the same .",
    "we also considered the couple of models argonne v18 and bonn - cd . in this case , a non - local scalar term is also included , slightly obscuring the analysis .",
    "in this section , we compare wave functions obtained from various models differing by their non - locality . in principle , and as far as the models are phase - shift equivalent , it should be possible to relate the corresponding wave functions according to the equality : @xmath88 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are solutions of schrdinger equations with hamiltonians respectively given by eqs .",

    "they are due for a large part to the perturbative character of our approach . at the lowest distances , the effect of the transformation goes in the right direction .",

    "the effect is however too large .",
    "it is likely that a more accurate treatment would transfer part of the effect at larger distance , around @xmath109 , where the present effect is too small or even has a sign opposite to what was expected .",

    "the existence of the above structures may introduce a bias in the comparison of form factors and other observables that will be made in the next section .",

    "the studies presented in this work were originally performed with the idea that various nn interaction models could be equivalent ( up to a unitary transformation ) . with this respect , it is interesting that we can explain a large part of the differences between models .",
    "the question now arises to determine the limitations , if any . by construction ,",
    "the models are not identical .",
    "besides a difference in their non - locality , discussed throughout this work , there may be differences in the choice of various ingredients : coupling constants , vertex form factors , exchanged mesons together with their mass , quality of the fit to nn scattering data , number of free parameters , etc .... after the non - locality effects have been removed , the comparison of model predictions can thus reveal more clearly features in relation with these ingredients .",

    "[ fignij3 ] ( left part ) , we show an example where an approximate agreement between two models turns into a discrepancy when the influence of the non - local interaction is accounted for . it concerns the charge form factor calculated with the bonn - qb and nij93 models in the range @xmath163 to @xmath164 . being alone , this example , which is given to illustrate our purpose , does not allow one to draw conclusions on one of the two models under consideration . however",
    ", after incorporating the non - locality effect , it appears that the charge form factor for the nij93 model evidences the same pattern as for the other models .",
    "this can be seen in the comparison of the @xmath15 structure function calculated with the nij93 model and with the set of models nij1 , nij2 , reid93 , argonne v18 which , as already mentioned , provide very close results when non - locality effects are taken into account . the ratio of these quantities , shown in fig .

    "this tends to suggest that the nij93 model involves specific features that are absent in the other models .",
    "it is tempting to make a correlation with the fact that this model predicts a smaller radius than the other ones , whose effect could not be seen clearly without removing effects of the non - locality . as to the origin of this smaller radius",
    ", it could be due to the poorer quality of the fit to scattering nn data ( only 15 parameters ) . not independently",
    ", it could also be due to the presence in this model of a pomeron exchange contribution which is ignored in all the other models .",
    "its long range is likely to produce specific features that could not be easily accounted for with shorter range contributions to the potential .",
    "another particular feature shows up when comparing the @xmath15 structure function calculated with the paris model to that one calculated with one of models nij1 , nij2 , reid93 , argonne v18 and bonn - cd and the appropriate corrections for non - locality effects .",

    "a similar but less pronounced effect is seen with the bonn - qb model .",
    "again , the difference in the slope suggests to look at the deuteron radius predicted by the models .",
    "it is thus found that the radius for the paris and bonn - qb models , after accounting for non - locality effects , are slightly larger than for the other models . before wondering about a possible origin for this difference in the radius ,",
    "we emphasize another feature that may have some relation .",
    "it concerns the quadrupole form factor and more specifically the quadrupole moment .",
    "in many cases , we could explain differences in the quadrupole moment by the difference in the non - locality of the models .",
    "this is not the case for the paris model ( and to a lesser extent for the bonn - qb model ) as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figpari ] ( left part ) .",
    "the quadrupole moment for the paris model is always larger than for the other models by an amount of 3 - 4% .",
    "there is no direct relation to the radius discussed above although a larger value will certainly contribute to produce a larger quadrupole moment .",
    "an explanation could be looked for in the value of the @xmath14 coupling constant which is larger for the paris ( and bonn - qb ) model than for the other models which , for some of them , have been built on the prejudice of a value around @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "the value for the paris model is closer to that one advocated by ericson et al .",
    ", @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "a larger coupling implies a larger attraction at large distances and therefore a larger probability to find the neutron and the proton far apart in the deuteron . in the case of the paris model , one can add that the explicit two - pion exchange contribution is likely to also produce a larger attraction at long distances in comparison with an approximation where this contribution is treated as an exchange of an effective @xmath12 with mass around 500 mev .",
    "in this work , we have studied the effect of non - local terms on the description of the nn interaction .",
    "we especially looked at terms which involve the anticommutator with the operator @xmath0 , namely @xmath167 .",
    "the present work completes another one where terms of the commutator form @xmath168 $ ] , with an off - shell character , were considered . in dealing with these terms , we relied on an explicit form for the transformation allowing to get rid of them , which furthermore was treated at the first order in the interaction . in comparing models , this approach is probably not as good as an approach based on inverse scattering methods .",
    "it nevertheless has the advantage to be based on the explicit identification of non - local terms in interaction models and to provide an insight on the currents that have to be associated with the models .",
    "as far as we can see , the method is accurate enough for our purpose , especially in view of its qualitative character for a part . on the other hand ,",
    "the study has been extended to other interaction models , allowing one to draw conclusions that the comparison of two models only could not .    for our study of the newly considered terms",
    ", we took the scalar part , @xmath22 , from the paris model while the tensor part , @xmath23 , was taken from the sum of a contribution due to pion exchange , rather well determined , and a short range contribution .",
    "it is reminded that there is no a priori guarantee that these non - local terms can explain differences in interaction models which could have other sources and in some cases could not be explained ( when they involve differences in observables such the asymptotic normalizations , @xmath70 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "we found that the scalar part , @xmath22 , has quite small contributions to static quantities , such as the charge radius or the quadrupole moment . to evidence them",
    ", one has to get rid of contributions due to different asymptotic normalizations for instance , which compete with the effects we are looking at or are even larger .",
    "some sizeable effect however shows up for dynamical observables such as form factors .",
    "it is difficult to make a definitive statement on the size of the effect in view of various uncertainties , but its sign and its magnitude can reasonably explain differences between models differing by the above term .    concerning the tensor part , @xmath169 , the contribution to static properties is more important .",
    "it , in particular , explains a non - negligeable part of the difference in the deuteron d - state probabilities between the bonn models , which account for the full structure of dirac spinors , and the other ones .",
    "when added to the effect of non - local terms with an off - shell character , which is larger , not much difference remains to be explained . for dynamical observables , the effect of the above term goes also in the right direction and accounts for a half of what could not be previously explained with the off - shell term .",
    "it would be interesting to see what would do an extra non - local tensor term omitted in our analysis .",
    "this one has a short range behavior but also a different structure which would require further theoretical elaboration .",
    "while a large part of differences evidenced by the comparison of models with various non - localities can be ascribed to this feature , we would not like to give the impression that every difference can be explained that way .",
    "interestingly , after removing the above effects , some differences between models , that were masked until now , more clearly appear .",
    "the correlation between the slope of the deuteron structure function , @xmath15 , and the deuteron radius , which is expected to hold in any case at very small @xmath1 , is found to extend to higher @xmath1 , up to @xmath170 .",
    "knowing that there is for local models an empirical relation between the radius and the asymptotic normalization , @xmath70 , the above observations raises the question of which model is the best with this respect , taking into account that this quantity is not changed in the transformations we performed .",
    "the examination of the quadrupole form factor , especially at @xmath163 , where it identifies to the quadrupole moment , @xmath136 , also shows interesting features . for this one ,",
    "contributions involving the non - locality can amount to 1% , which is less than the difference between the upper value obtained with the paris model ( 0.279 @xmath171 ) and the lower ones ( around 0.270 - 0.271 @xmath171 ) , obtained with the nij1 , nij2 , reid93 , bonn - cd models . curiously , there is no direct relation to the value of the ratio , @xmath72 , which mainly determines this moment . after the effect of the non - locality",
    "is accounted for , which mainly affects values obtained with the bonn models with respect to the other ones , we observe that the quadrupole moments are exactly in the same order as the @xmath172 values and not far to be proportional to them . accounting for the non - locality effects therefore restores some regularity that was lost when considering predictions of bonn models .    throughout this paper , we ignored comparison with measurements , being essentially concerned by the comparison of theoretical predictions .",
    "we believe it is important in discriminating between models to separate effects that are due simply to a mathematical representation of the interaction , with more or less non - locality , and effects that have their origin in genuine aspects of the models . in making a comparison to measurements",
    ", one has first to determine among the various approximately phase - shift equivalent descriptions of the nn interaction which one is the more realistic , in the sense of relying on degrees of freedom that are as little effective as possible .",
    "then , one has to also account for contributions from two - body currents corresponding to this optimal model .",
    "some work along these lines has recently been done with the aim to extract the neutron charge form factor from the knowledge of the deuteron quadrupole form factor @xcite .",
