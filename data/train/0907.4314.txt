    "since the first observation of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in dilute weakly interacting gases of bosons in 1995 , great efforts both experimental and theoretical have been addressed on this subject . thus nowadays ,",
    "thanks to the impressive progress of experimental techniques , becs represent a source of inspiration for new challenging problems in quantum physics . a notable aspect inherent in the dynamics of coupled becs",
    "is that the nonlinear character of their equations of motion entails a particularly rich phenomenology where nonlinear effects including chaos can be studied in a quantum environment . among the latter , in recent experiments",
    "have been observed phenomena such as super - fluidity @xcite , josephson tunneling @xcite and atom optics @xcite .",
    "if the recent past has been prolific of experiments on becs arranged into arrays with huge number ( of the order of several hundreds ) of condensates , at the present , the experiments on chains with a few interacting becs ( of the order of several unities ) has received a limited attention @xcite-@xcite despite the increasing amount of theoretical work devoted to such systems . over the last few years ,",
    "small_-chain models has been focused in particular on the two - well system ( dimer ) @xcite-@xcite and the three - well system ( trimer )  @xcite , @xcite while their many - well generalization has been studied in  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction of macroscopic effects such as coherent atomic tunneling  @xcite , population self - trapping  @xcite , and josephson junction effect  @xcite , have been confirmed by recent observations in the experimental realization of the dimer  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these results stimulate the theoretic study of the bec small chains in order to predict new macroscopic effects that , in addition to furnishing a deeper insight of stability properties and an increased control of systems , open the possibility of designing significant experiments . in this respect ,",
    "the recent experimental technique discussed in @xcite and successfully applied to realize a two - well system provides an extremely effective tool for engineering small arrays .",
    "the superposition of a parabolic confining potential to a linear optical lattice allows one to select two wells ( dimer ) with possibly different depths by changing the parabola position and amplitude .",
    "likewise , a simple , suitable change of the latter should enable one to select @xmath0-well arrays , with @xmath0 arbitrary , whose ( local ) potentials feature a parabolic profile .",
    "the trimer case is thus very promising in that , in addition to represent a practicable experimental objective , it exhibits behaviors typical of more complex arrays .",
    "in fact , while the simplest bec array ( the dimer ) features an integrable dynamics  @xcite , in the trimer case the apparently harmless addition of a further coupled condensate is sufficient to make the system nonintegrable . as a consequence ,",
    "the trimer displays strong dynamical instabilities in extended regions of the phase space @xcite and a whole new class of behaviors including chaos . in general ,",
    "unstable behaviors have been found in condensates subject to kicked pulses @xcite or to an anisotropic trapping potential @xcite and within soliton dynamics  @xcite .",
    "concerning the trimer , a conspicuous number of recent papers has addressed various aspects of its dynamics .",
    "these include , within a mean - field approach , the occurrence of a transistor - like behavior @xcite , and the self - trapping @xcite in a triple - well asymmetric trap of repulsive bosons , the ring - trimer dynamics with attractive interaction in the presence of a single on - site defect @xcite , and the chaos control through an external laser pulse @xcite .",
    "recently , the dynamical instability has been studied in terms of quasimomentum modes for a @xmath1-well semiclassical bose - hubbard model including a linear potential @xcite .",
    "also , more related to purely quantum properties , second - quantized models of the trimer have been considered to study the properties of quantum states relevant to interwell particle exchange @xcite and entanglement @xcite , the semiclassical quantization of the bogoliubov spectrum @xcite , the structural changes of trimer eigenstates in terms of the tunneling parameter @xcite , and the occurrence of vortex - like states @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the classical dynamics of an asymmetric open trimer ( aot ) made of three coupled becs arranged into an open chain geometry , where both the interwell tunneling amplitude @xmath2 and the relative depth @xmath3 of the central well , are regarded as adjustable parameters .",
    "our objective is to evidence several macroscopic effects that can take place in the aot dynamics to provide a useful guide for future experiments . in section  [ s : dyn ]",
    "we introduce the semiclassical equations of the trimer mean - field dynamics . in section  [",
    "s : fp ] , after determining the solutions relevant to the fixed points of motion equations , i. e. the proper modes of trimer dynamics , we focus mostly on establishing , via standard procedures , their stability character for experimentally significant values of effective parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the effective interatomic scattering and the total boson number , respectively .",
    "in section  [ s : sd ] we review the ( three ) _ stability diagrams _",
    "( one for each class of fixed points ) that summarize characters and properties of fixed points .",
    "these supply an exhaustive , operationally valuable , account of the system stability properties and allow to determine the stable / unstable charater of the system evolution for initial conditions situated , in the phase space , close to a given fixed point . both the derivation and the use of such diagrams , rapidly sketched in @xcite , are discussed here ( and in the relevant appendices ) with some detail together with various new applications .    by using the _ stability diagrams _ as a map for detecting the critical behaviors of trimer , in section  [ s : macroeff ] we find parameter - tuned macroscopic effects ( both in the dimeric and nondimeric regime ) and evidence some features that may prove experimentally relevant .",
    "such effects are shown to arise when crossing either the boundaries of regions with different stability characters or the boundaries of forbidden regions or , finally , by exploiting the coalescence / bifurcation mechanism characterizing certain fixed points . in section  [ s : cdwi ] we consider the special case of @xmath8-like states relevant to the fixed points of the regime charaterized by a central depleted well .",
    "we investigate the unexpected relation between the average population oscillations and the initial phase difference of the lateral condensates , suggesting a possible experiment .",
    "finally , section  [ s : conc ] is devoted to make some concluding remarks .",

    "the total boson number @xmath17 , commutes with hamiltonian ( [ e : ham3 ] ) .",
    "the exact form of parameters @xmath6 and @xmath2 is calculated in  @xcite showing how such quantities depend on @xmath16 , on the laser wavelength @xmath18 , and on the potential depth @xmath19 of potential @xmath20 determining the optical lattice .",
    "the 3-well linear system , obtained by superposing the optical potential to parabolic potential @xmath21 confining bosons  @xcite , @xcite , is expected to have lateral wells with depth @xmath13 smaller then the central - well depth @xmath22 due to the presence of the parabolic potential .",
    "the dynamics of the aot with strong tunnelling amplitudes ( @xmath23 ) and large average numbers of atoms per well can be described by the mean - field form of ( [ e : ham3 ] ) .",
    "the method developed in @xcite combines the coherent - state picture of quantum systems with the time - dependent variational approach  @xcite providing the semiclassical version of quantum model ( [ e : ham3 ] ) in which the dynamical canonical variables are the expectation values @xmath24 , @xmath25 . the so - called trial macroscopic wave function @xmath26 is standardly assumed to be @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the glauber coherent states such that @xmath30 for each @xmath31 .",
    "then , the resulting mean - field hamiltonian reads @xmath32   - w |z_2|^2-\\frac{_t}{^2}[\\ , z_2^ * ( z_1+z_3 ) + { \\rm c.c . } ] \\ , , \\ ] ] which , through the poisson brackets @xmath33 , yields the dynamical equations @xmath34 the validity of such a semiclassical picture is confirmed experimentally  @xcite , @xcite for the time scale ( hundreds of milliseconds ) of the macroscopic oscillations in a two - well system .",
    "the effect of approximating the system state @xmath26 through a product of localized ( coherent ) states @xmath35 appears on a much longer time scale  @xcite when @xmath26 must be expressed as a superposition of fock states @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) to include ( quantum ) delocalization effects .",
    "an early analysis of equations ( [ e : dyneq ] ) for @xmath38 is reported in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is easy matter to check that system ( [ e : dyneq ] ) embodies the conservation of boson total number @xmath39 , namely @xmath40 .",
    "constant @xmath7 can be exploited to introduce new rescaled variables @xmath41 whose evolution is governed by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and the prime denotes derivation with respect to the rescaled time variable @xmath44 .",
    "this shows that the two significant parameters of the trimer dynamics are @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( namely , at fixed @xmath7 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , parameter @xmath13 being incorporated in the time dependent factor @xmath49 of new variables @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to verify that the condition @xmath51 is valid for @xmath52 ( or , equivalently , that @xmath53 holds for every @xmath54 ) if , initially , @xmath55 .",
    "such a condition identifies an integrable subregime where the lateral condensates have the same population and phase ( see , e. g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) which in the following we shall refer to as _ dimeric regime_.      we can get insight about the behaviour of the system in different dynamical regimes through the study of special exact solutions along with their stability character . with the latter we mean the simplest ( single mode ) periodic orbits in the phase space of the form @xmath56 . substituting the latter in equations ( [ e : dyneq2 ] ) provides the equations for variables @xmath57 .",
    "such equations can be equivalently obtained from @xmath58 with @xmath59 , where the chemical potential @xmath16 , a lagrange multiplier , allows one to include the conserved quantity @xmath60 derived from the total boson number @xmath61 . owing to the condition @xmath62 we name fixed - point equations the equations determining @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",

    "[ e : fpsys ] we have exploited the system symmetry , inherited from equations [ e : dyneq2 ] , under a global phase shift @xmath69 to restrict coordinates @xmath67 ( which are in principle complex numbers ) to the real axis .",
    "let us summarize the solutions of system ( [ e : fpsys ] ) .",
    "_ central depleted well_. this parameter - independent solution is obtained when the central well is strictly depleted , that is @xmath70 , whereas the lateral ones have the same population and opposite phases . due to the constraint on the number",
    "it must necessarily be @xmath71 , @xmath72 . in summary @xmath73",
    "we shall refer to this solution as _ central depleted well _",
    "( cdw ) . since configurations where either one or both of the lateral condensates have zero population are forbidden by equations  ( [ e : fpsys ] ) , we are left with the following two possibilities .",
    "_ dimeric solutions_. similar to ( [ e : dyneq ] ) and ( [ e : dyneq2 ] ) , equations ( [ e : fpsys ] ) possess dimeric solutions characterized by @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these solutions can be expressed via the polar representation @xmath76 introducing this parametrization in ( [ e : fpsys ] ) one finds that the tangent @xmath77 of the angular coordinate @xmath78 identifying each fixed point is given by the real roots of @xmath79 with @xmath80 , @xmath81 . in the following",
    "we shall refer to this class of solutions as _ dimeric fixed points _",
    "( dfp ) whose derivation is discussed in [ s : dr ] .    _ non - dimeric solutions_. the remaining single - mode solutions of system ( [ e : fpsys ] ) , characterized by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , will be referred to as _ non - dimeric fixed points _ ( nfp ) . in this case",
    "it is appropriate to switch to the alternative set of coordinates @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 before setting @xmath87 in this case the radial coordinate @xmath88 reads @xmath89 and depends on the hamiltonian parameter @xmath46 and on parameter @xmath90 . by introducing this parametrization in system ( [ e : fpsys ] ) one finds that @xmath90 is given by the real roots of @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "since the physical solutions of system ( [ e : fpsys ] ) have to be real it is clear that the roots which make @xmath94 or @xmath95 imaginary , must be discarded .",
    "the next section contains a qualitative discussion of the three stability diagrams describing the entire set of solutions of system ( [ e : fpsys ] ) for any choice of @xmath46 and @xmath45 .",
    "a detailed derivation of such fixed points is given in [ s : nr ] .",
    "the stability diagrams introduced in @xcite allow one to know both number and stability character of the fixed points of trimer dynamics for any choice of significant parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that vector @xmath96 describing a fixed point can be parametrized by the angular coordinate @xmath78 of the two - dimensional polar representations ( [ dfp ] ) , and ( [ ndfp_p ] ) and ( [ ndfp_ra ] ) for the dfp and the nfp , respectively . to determine parameter @xmath78 ( and thus the vector @xmath97 relevant to a given fixed point ) we must find the roots of the fourth - degree polynomial @xmath98 in the unknown quantity @xmath99 .",
    "this allows one to determine @xmath100 in the dimeric case with @xmath101 ( see ( [ dfp_c ] ) ) , and @xmath102 in the non - dimeric case with @xmath103 ( see ( [ ndfp_pol ] ) ) . in the latter case vector @xmath104",
    "is obtained by using the constraint @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , for a given value of parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 , the number of roots of ( [ genpol ] ) establishes how many dfp and nfp there exist .",

    "any point in the plane @xmath106 is implicitly associated to a definite value of parameter @xmath45 , owing to equation ( [ genpol ] ) .",
    "this can be seen by rewriting ( [ genpol ] ) as @xmath107   = - \\frac{\\left[a_\\nu \\tan^2(\\theta)+b_\\nu\\right]\\tan(\\theta)}{\\tan^4(\\theta)+c } \\",

    "the linear stability analysis determining the character of fixed points ( and , in practice , the whole structure of such phase diagrams ) is discussed in [ s : asd ] .",
    "as an example , in figures  [ fig : dn ] and [ fig : nn ] are reported with different dashing styles , five straight horizontal lines corresponding to several values of the @xmath45 .",
    "the five curves drawn in figures  [ fig : ds ] and [ fig : ns ] , refer to the straight lines drawn with the same dashing styles in figures  [ fig : dn ] and [ fig : nn ] , for the dimeric and non - dimeric case , respectively .",
    "notice that in general these curves consist of two or more non - connected branches . in the dimeric case",
    "there are always two unbounded branches featuring an asymptote at @xmath113 or at @xmath114 . for @xmath115",
    "$ ] a further , roughly parabolic , bounded branch appears .",
    "this means that for any choice of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 there are always at least two dfps , and that , for suitable choices of these parameters , two more fixed points appear .    in the non - dimeric case ,",
    "figure  [ fig : ns ] , the curves @xmath116 $ ] consist of either one or two bounded parabola - like branches , hence featuring zero , two or four intersection with a constant-@xmath46 straight line .",
    "however , for certain values of the parameters , not all of these intersections represent fixed points , i.e. real solutions of system ( [ e : fpsys ] ) . indeed , as it is discussed in [ s :",
    "nr ] , some of the real roots of polynomial @xmath117 more precisely the ones lying in the patterned regions of figure  [ fig : ns] result in complex - valued solutions of system ( [ e : fpsys ] ) and therefore must be discarded .",
    "in particular , the patterned ( forbidden ) regions of figure  [ fig : ns ] can be shown to correspond to the white region in the @xmath46-@xmath45 plane of figure  [ fig : nn ] where no solution is permitted .",
    "figures  [ fig : ds ] and [ fig : ns ] also supply important information concerning fixed points and their characteristic energies . referring to the different colours used in such figures ,",
    "a fixed point is a ( stable ) minimum , a stable saddle , an unstable saddle or a ( stable ) maximum of the energy function depending on whether the region it lies in is white , light grey , medium grey or dark grey .",
    "as we mentioned above , other than the dfps and the nfps , a further fixed point , the cdw configuration , is present for any value of @xmath46 and @xmath45 .",
    "the parameter independence of the relevant configuration @xmath118 , makes the use of a polar representation unnecessary , and allows one to draw its stability diagram in the parameter plane @xmath46-@xmath45 in a direct way .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cdw ] .",
    "a careful look at stability diagrams [ fig : ds ] and [ fig : ns ] , in addition to provide , at first glance , number and properties of the fixed points of aot dynamics for any choice of @xmath46 and @xmath45 , allows one to single out at least three ways to produce macroscopic , and hence experimentally observable , effects by means of a simple change of model parameters .",
    "_ crossing boundaries of regions with a different character . _ for suitable choices of @xmath45 , curves @xmath116 $ ] may cross the boundary dividing regions with different stability properties .",
    "thus , by slightly and adiabatically changing the hamiltonian parameters ( e.g. the optical potential amplitude ) the system can modify significantly its behavior .",
    "this is the case of ( one of ) the asymptotic branches of the dimeric curves , which , for any @xmath119 , crosses the boundary between the maxima and the unstable saddles region ( see , e. g. , the branch in figure [ fig : dn ] corresponding to @xmath120 in figure [ fig : nn ] ) . likewise , in the non - dimeric case , one of the parabola - like branches of curves @xmath116 $ ] always crosses the interesting unstable `` isthmus '' splitting the large stable ( light - grey ) region in figure  [ fig : ns ] , provided that @xmath121 .    _",

    "_ at the `` tips '' of the parabola - like branches of curves @xmath116 $ ] , a _ coalescence_/_bifurcation _ _ effect _ of pairs of fixed points takes place . hence , for some values @xmath122 of the hopping parameter it is possible to find a value @xmath123 with two coincident solutions of fixed - point equations located at the parabolic - branch tip . by varying @xmath45 ,",
    "the branch tip moves away from @xmath122 , and the coincident solutions either split ( i.e. bifurcate ) or disappear accordingly .",
    "let us emphasize that in the non - dimeric case ( figure  [ fig : ns ] ) the coalescence phenomena always involve fixed points with different stability characters , whereas , in the dimeric case ( figure  [ fig : ds ] ) only the coalescence of two fixed points of the same kind may happen , provided that @xmath124 ( see next section ) .    _ crossing forbidden - region boundaries .",
    "_ significant changes in the phase - space structure of the system are expected as well where the non - dimeric curves @xmath116 $ ] cross the boundaries of forbidden zones . indeed , in this case , a slight change in the parameters may cause the sudden appearance / disappearance of a fixed point . as to the cdw fixed points , which according to the hessian signature is always a saddle , figure  [ fig : cdw ] clearly shows that it may display an either stable or unstable character , depending on the choice of parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 based on these three mechanisms , we discuss the results of several numeric simulations evidencing how macroscopic effects are induced in the aot dynamics by slight changes in parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 ( similar effects on the stability of the many - well system with @xmath125 , of vortexlike modes in a 1d array and of localized modes in a 2d array have been studied in  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "these entail that trajectories based on the same initial configuration may exhibit an either regular or chaotic behavior .",
    "the character of the aot dynamics , can be conveniently investigated by constructing appropriate poincar sections within the four - dimensional _ reduced _ phase - space spanned by the ( _ reduced _ ) set of canonical variables @xmath126 .",
    "this reduction is obtained via the canonical transformation @xmath127 @xmath128 , where @xmath129 once the condition @xmath130 is taken into account and one notices that the @xmath131 evolution is nonautonomous ( see @xcite for details on the reduced dynamics ) .",
    "we have numerically integrated the trimer equations of motion in the reduced coordinates , by a first - order bilateral symplectic algorithm .",
    "moreover , we have qualitatively investigated the degree of regularity of the ensuing trajectories by means of poincar sections .",
    "the latter are obtained by projecting the points belonging to a given submanifold , characterized by a given value of one of the four reduced variables , onto the plane spanned by two of the three remaining variables .",
    "all of the poincar sections reported in the following refer to a set of trajectories based on an array of starting points surrounding a significant configuration of the system , usually a fixed point , of reduced coordinates @xmath132 . in every instance",
    "the points belonging to the submanifold @xmath133 have been projected onto the @xmath134-@xmath135 plane .",
    "the first macroscopic effect we discuss here has been briefly discussed in @xcite and concerns the dimeric configuration @xmath136 , with @xmath137 bosons in each lateral well and the remaining @xmath138 in the central one which is represented by the angular variable , @xmath139 .",
    "one can show that the latter is a ( dimeric ) fixed point provided that @xmath140 .",
    "furthermore , such a fixed point is either a maximum or an unstable saddle depending on whether @xmath45 is smaller or larger than the critical value @xmath141 .",
    "this is clearly visible in figure  [ fig : dexp ] , where two different parameter choices @xmath142 and @xmath143 , shown with the letters @xmath0 and @xmath144 , are considered .",
    "the crossing of the boundary separating the stable and unstable regions has evident consequences .",
    "the poincar sections ( reported in @xcite ) of trajectories , based on a set of points closely surrounding the fixed point under concern @xmath145 , mirror the dramatic change in the dynamical behaviour involved in such a slight parameter change . while choice @xmath142 results in the neat and regular poincar sections characterizing a stable fixed point , with choice @xmath143 sections densely fill an area considerably larger than the previous example , despite the relevant trajectories are based on the very same points @xcite .",
    "an instability outbreak similar to that discussed above is found in the neighborhood of the `` instability isthmus '' of the non - dimeric stability diagram  [ fig : ns ] .",
    "indeed , the possibly present upper branch of the non - dimeric @xmath46 curve always crosses such unstable region .",
    "this is the case of four of the five curves plotted in figure  [ fig : ns ] and of the curve with @xmath146 plotted in figure  [ fig : gexp ] .",
    "the inset of figure  [ fig : gexp ] is a magnification showing fixed points @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , located in the proximity of the instability `` isthmus '' for three slightly different values of @xmath46 ( @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) .",
    "these fixed points correspond to ( slightly ) different values of coordinate @xmath78 , thus the corresponding configurations are quite similar to each other . in these three cases",

    "the last case considers several unexpected and interesting features of cdw fixed points .",
    "remarkably , these fixed points are always present independently from the value of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 , and have a simple configuration where the entire boson population is equally shared between the lateral condensates , being the phases opposite to each other . figure  [",
    "fig : cdw ] shows that the cdw are saddle points and are expected to exhibit a stable character in extended regions of the parameter plane .",
    "this fact , is widely confirmed by our numeric simulations where , for initial configurations sufficiently close to the cdw fixed point , we observe a regular dynamics exhibiting ( possibly quite complex ) periodic oscillations of the three condensate populations . in particular , the lateral condensates cyclically exchange small amounts of bosons , so that their population imbalance oscillates . whereas the central condensate , whose population oscillates with a considerably smaller amplitude and a frequency twice than that of the lateral condensates , participates in the dynamics acting as a bridge between the lateral ones .",
    "figure [ fig : cdwsu ] shows the evolution of a configuration quite close to the cdw for two parameter choices belonging to different stability regions of figure  [ fig : cdw ] .",
    "as expected , in the stable case ( panels * a * and * b * ) , the amplitude of the population oscillations increases with increasing displacement of the initial configuration from the cdw .",
    "of course , in general , such displacement can not be increased indefinitely : the initial configuration would eventually leave the `` domain of influence '' of the cdw and the consequent trajectory would be determined by the stability character of a different fixed point .",
    "the same considerations apply to configurations obtained from the cdw by setting the phase difference between the lateral condensates to a value @xmath158 and maintaining the total boson population equally shared by the lateral condensates . in this case",
    "the oscillation amplitude is a function of @xmath159 with a minimum at @xmath160 , where it vanishes .",
    "our numeric simulations confirm these predictions .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently small @xmath46 s , regular oscillatory dynamics is observed over the entire range of @xmath161 .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure  [ fig : cdwpops ] , displaying the population oscillations pertaining to initial configurations identified by several values of @xmath161 .",
    "a further important feature of the cdw fixed points is highlighted by figure  [ fig : xpamp ] showing that for small values of @xmath46 , the amplitude @xmath162 of the oscillation of the population @xmath163 exhibits a quite simple dependence on the phase difference @xmath161 of the relevant initial configuration .",
    "more precisely @xmath162 linearly depends on @xmath164 .",
    "a rigorous discussion of such dependence is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "however , some insight in this sense can be gained by adopting an approach similar to that developed in  @xcite in the study of the stability of the dimeric integrable subregime .",
    "interestingly , the same linear behavior as in figure  [ fig : xpamp ] is obtained by relaxing the requirement that the entire boson population is equally shared by the two lateral condensates .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure  [ fig : xpav ] , where we plotted the average oscillation amplitude relevant to initial configurations characterized by a certain phase difference @xmath161 and condensate populations @xmath165 slightly displaced from that of the cdw fixed point .",
    "the plots displayed in figures  [ fig : xpamp ] and [ fig : xpav ] suggest the possibility of measuring the phase difference between two equally populated condensates .",
    "let us stressing the fact that , in order to profitably exploit this quantum effect to measure the difference of phase between two condensates , we need of a nondestructive real - time probing of the condensates such as the technique employed to image dimer - like condensates confined by magnetic traps @xcite .",
    "the present paper has been inspired by the wish of gaining a deeper insight both on the complexity of three - well dynamics ( which , as noted above , is the paradigm of the behavior one can expect in more complex becs arrays ) and on the possibility of detecting macroscopic effects amenable to experimental observation .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that the superposition of multiple laser beams could allow to create unusual optical lattices in a controlled manner @xcite . in this respect , we observe that a suitable choice of laser wavelengths could generate a superlattice whose elementary cell is characterized by a three - well potential such as the one addressed in the present paper .",
    "the further minimization of the tunneling between subsequent trimeric cells should provide an alternative experimental realization of the system under concern . a nice example in",
    "this sense is the trimerized kagom optical lattice  @xcite providing ( multiple copies of ) the trapping potential typical of a symmetric closed trimer .    in the present paper we focus on the rich phenomenology offered by the trimer and on the possibility of triggering macroscopic effects through a suitable choice of the adjustable parameters , relegating as much as possible to the appendices the technical details necessarily involved in a systematic analysis .",
    "the macroscopic effects we evidence in this paper are obtained through a careful analysis of the stability diagrams introduced in @xcite , whose operational value is reviewed in section [ s : sd ] .",
    "their derivation is thoroughly discussed in [ s : asd ] .",
    "such diagrams describe the trimer phase space in terms of the stability character of dynamical fixed points for any choice of the significant parameters .",
    "this wealth of information enriches the recent literature about the dynamical stability of mesoscopic bec arrays @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite and supplies an essential tool in designing experimental realizations of the trimer dynamics .",
    "also , at the theoretical level , it provides a sound basis for gaining a deeper insight into the quantum counterpart of classical dynamical instability , which is far from being fully understood .",
    "the use of stability diagrams leads to identify in section [ s : macroeff ] three different mechanisms able to modify in a substantial way the trimer dynamics .",
    "these are exploited in sections [ s : priming ] , [ s : losscoher ] and [ s : instsupp ] to prime instability in breather - like regular oscillations , loss of coherence in anti - breather states , and suppression of instability due to fixed - point disappearance , respectively .",
    "macroscopic dynamical oscillations are shown to be triggered by means of slight parameter changes thus providing a stimulating basis for planning actual experiments in the scheme described in  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the stability diagrams in section [ s : cdwi ] also evidences that a simple configuration exists allowing to relate in a direct manner the initial phase difference between two condensates to the amplitude of the ensuing population oscillations .",
    "this suggests a rather simple scheme aimed at testing experimentally the limits of validity of the mean - field picture , where each condensate is endowed with a macroscopic phase .",
    "the study of the fixed points inherent in the classical picture reported in sections [ s : dyn ] and [ s : sd ] proves useful also in unraveling the complex structure of the energy spectrum of the quantum trimer , in that it allows to recognize a ( either exact or approximate ) mapping with a simpler dimeric system @xcite .",
    "the mapping is shown to persist also at the quantum level , thus extending the results found in @xcite to the case of the quantum trimer .",
    "these results provide a useful starting point in investigating the quantum counterpart  @xcite of classical dynamical instability .",
    "a deeper insight into the relation between the classical and quantum picture is certainly useful for the approaches to this issue based on the dynamical algebra method @xcite or on the measure of quantum - state entanglement @xcite .",
    "the linear stability character of a fixed point @xmath166 can be determined by studying the eigenvalues of the matrix associated to the ( linearized ) equations governing the dynamics of the ( small ) displacements @xmath167 from the fixed point itself , where @xmath168 .",
    "the hamiltonian , up to the second order in the small displacements @xmath169 , reads @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "as it is well known , linear instability occurs when at least one of such ( in principle complex ) eigenvalues features a positive real part .",
    "the linearized equations obtained from hamiltonian ( [ e : hpq ] ) through poisson s brackets @xmath173 ( these stem from the original ones @xmath174 ) have the form @xmath175 in accordance with the expected time reversal symmetry of the linear dynamics , the six ( complex ) eigenvalues of matrix @xmath176 come in pairs featuring the same modulus and opposite signs .",
    "more precisely each pair of eigenvalues of @xmath176 consists in the signed square roots of an eigenvalue of the three - by - three matrix @xmath177 .",
    "indeed , due to the diagonal block structure of @xmath176 , the relevant eigenvalue equation is @xmath178 , where in writing the characteristic polynomial of @xmath177 we took into account the fact that , similar to @xmath179 , such a matrix has a zero eigenvalue .",
    "this feature is the consequence of the fact that both @xmath180 and @xmath181 are constrained by the condition @xmath182 . according to @xmath183",
    "the fixed point is ( linearly ) stable provided that the three conditions @xmath184 are simultaneously met . indeed in this case",
    "the two non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath177 are real and non - positive , so that the four non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath176  namely their signed square roots  are purely imaginary .",
    "conversely , whenever an eigenvalue of @xmath185 is complex or real positive , one of its square roots has necessarily a positive real part , giving rise to ( linear ) instability .",
    "the following subsections describe in some detail the construction of the stability diagrams for the dfp , the nfp and the cdw .      as illustrated in section [ s : dyn ] , the dimeric fixed points ( dfp ) pertain to the integrable dimeric subregime @xcite of the dynamics described by system ( [ e : dyneq ] ) , which is characterized by @xmath186 .",
    "in this situation the fixed point configuration @xmath187 is described by @xmath188 and @xmath189 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ dfp ] ) ) , where the tangent @xmath190 must be a real root of polynomial @xmath191 ( see formula ( [ dfp_c ] ) ) with @xmath80 , @xmath81 . before proceeding to a more detailed discussion of the dfp case , we remark that the previous polar representation of @xmath57 s allows one to readily relate variable @xmath78 to the fixed point @xmath187 .",
    "particularly , @xmath192 shows how @xmath193 corresponds to a situation where the central condensate is almost depleted , so that the total population is ( equally ) shared by the lateral condensates .",
    "conversely , when @xmath194 the lateral condensates are almost empty and the total population is concentrated in the central one .",
    "notice also that the sign of @xmath78 is similarly strictly related to the phase differences between the central condensate and the lateral ones .",
    "more precisely such phase differences are 0 or @xmath195 depending on whether @xmath78 is positive or negative .    as we discussed above , solving the fixed point equations for the dfp amounts to finding the real roots of the fourth - degree polynomial @xmath196 ( henceforth denoted by @xmath197 ) .",
    "four real solutions are found from @xmath198 for @xmath199^{{3}/{2}}\\ ] ] and two real solutions elsewhere in the parameter plane , as it is illustrated in figure [ fig : dn ] . in section [ s :",
    "sd ] , we showed how equation @xmath198 suggests that , for any choice of parameters @xmath200 , @xmath201 , the dfp can be found in the @xmath106 plane from the intersection of the parametric curve ( see [ e : gtauc ] ) @xmath202 with the vertical straight line @xmath112 .",
    "the curve @xmath203 features two asymptotes at @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that polynomial @xmath206 has no less than two real solutions . in particular",
    "it is easy to verify that when @xmath207 the values @xmath208 are solutions of @xmath198 .",
    "hence , in this case , the two unbounded branches coalesce with their asymptotes , thus providing @xmath46-independent solutions corresponding to the configurations @xmath209 . more generally , when @xmath210 the branches of the curve @xmath203 , and hence the roots of @xmath198 , are characterized by a reflection symmetry with respect to the nearest asymptote ( see figure  [ fig : ds ] ) .",
    "this can be seen by noticing that @xmath211   = \\frac{2\\,\\bar\\nu\\mp3 \\sin(2\\vartheta)}{\\sin(2\\vartheta ) }   \\frac{\\cos(2\\vartheta)}{2\\sqrt 2}\\ , , \\",

    "_ local character of the dfp_. this information is obtained by exploiting the constraint @xmath216 and the fixed point equations ( [ e : fpsys ] ) .",
    "after expressing the quantities appearing in matrices @xmath217 and @xmath179 ( see ( [ e : mqp ] ) ) as @xmath218 and @xmath219 , the analysis of the signature of both matrix @xmath217 and @xmath179 depending on parameter @xmath220 leads to the following conclusions . for any choice of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 ,",
    "a dfp is a minimum if the corresponding angular coordinate , @xmath78 , is positive .",
    "if , conversely , @xmath221 the fixed point is either a maximum or a saddle point depending on whether @xmath46 is greater or less than @xmath222 where @xmath223 $ ] with @xmath224 $ ] and @xmath225 @xmath226 $ ] .",
    "combining such results with the linear stability analysis based on equation @xmath183 ( defined after formula ( [ e : m11 ] ) ) confirms that both maxima and minima are , as expected , stable fixed points , whereas all the saddles of the dimeric regime are unstable .",
    "the situation for the dfp is summarized in the corresponding _ stability diagram _ displayed in figure  [ fig : ds ] .",
    "the differently shaded region pertain to fixed points with a different stability character .      since in this case @xmath82 , the polar representation of nondimeric fixed points ( nfp ) is not as simple as that of the dfp case .",
    "still , one can take advantage from the conservation of the total boson number .",
    "some algebraic manipulations of the fixed - point equations ( see _ non - dimeric solutions _ in section [ s : fp ] ) suggest to switch to the new coordinates @xmath227 @xmath228 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , obeying the constraint @xmath229 , before setting @xmath230 and @xmath231 . this way @xmath232 and radial coordinate ( [ ndfp_ra ] )",
    "are shown to depend on @xmath78 and @xmath46 as @xmath233 with @xmath234 , and the fixed points equations are equivalent to the equation for the roots of polynomial @xmath235 , ( henceforth denoted by @xmath236 ) , where @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( see [ ndfp_pol ] ) . recalling that we are ultimately looking for real solutions of system ( [ e : fpsys ] ) it is clear that the roots which make @xmath94 or @xmath237 imaginary must be discarded . before analysing how nfp are identified",
    ", it is important to remark that in the nfp case the relation among the auxiliary variable @xmath78 and the configuration of the fixed point is not as transparent as in the dfp case , basically due to the @xmath78 dependence of the radial variable ( [ e : rg ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , within the nfp stability diagram some special regions can be still recognized .",
    "notice indeed that , according to the previous definitions of @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 as well as to ( [ e : rg ] ) , the ( forbidden ) limit situations @xmath241 and @xmath242 correspond to the dimeric case @xmath243 and to the cdw case @xmath244 , @xmath70 , respectively . as we shall discuss below , these limit situations are actually the boundaries of two forbidden regions in the nfp diagram ( see ( [ e : forb ] ) and discussion ) . due to the restrictions on @xmath88 and @xmath240 , the diagram of figure  [ fig : nn ] , giving the number of fixed points relevant to system ( [ e : fpsys ] ) on varying parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 , is significantly richer than the corresponding diagram for the number of real roots of polynomial @xmath236 .",
    "indeed the latter consists of four regions , delimited by the solid lines appearing in figure  [ fig : nn ] .",
    "two of these regions correspond to situations where @xmath245 features only two real roots , whereas within the remaining regions the roots are either four or none .",
    "despite they are real , some of these roots can make either @xmath94 or @xmath246 complex .",
    "hence some new regions appear within the ones delimited by the solid curves , where the number of solutions must be decreased by either one or two units .",
    "as discussed in section [ s : sd ] , the features of diagram ( [ fig : nn ] ) can be better understood by resorting to the @xmath106 plane , where , similar to the dfp case , for a given choice @xmath112 , @xmath247 , the real roots of polynomial @xmath236 correspond to the intersections of curve @xmath248/(3{\\alpha}^4 + 1)\\ , , \\quad \\nu = \\tilde\\nu \\ , , \\ ] ] with the straight line @xmath112 . in the half plane @xmath249",
    "such curve consists in general of two bounded , roughly bell - shaped , branches .",
    "more precisely they are defined within the @xmath78 intervals @xmath250 $ ] and @xmath251 $ ] , respectively , where @xmath252 @xmath253 .",
    "when @xmath254 ( @xmath255 ) the former ( latter ) branch , which from now on will be referred to as the negative ( positive ) branch , disappears .",
    "these features readily explain the four regions in the diagram describing the number of real roots of @xmath236 .",
    "hence , provided @xmath256 is sufficiently small , there are either four or two solutions depending on whether @xmath257 or @xmath258 .",
    "indeed , for any straight line at a given value of @xmath46 , there exist for each branch a value of @xmath45 such that the branch and the straight line are tangent . denoting such values @xmath259 , where the superscript labels the branch , it is easy to check that @xmath260 is always a growing function of @xmath46",
    ". hence two solutions relevant to the negative ( positive ) branch are always present for @xmath261 [ @xmath262 .",
    "notice further that the presence of a region of parameters where four solutions are found implies that there exists some @xmath263 such that @xmath264 .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath236 features four real roots in the region @xmath265 , no real roots in the region @xmath266 and two real roots elsewhere .",
    "the explicit expressions of functions @xmath267 and @xmath268 for @xmath269 and @xmath270 , respectively , ( solid lines in figure  [ fig : ns ] ) can be easily described in a parametric way by means of two curves @xmath271 , @xmath272 : the curve @xmath273 intersects @xmath274 at the tips of its bell - shaped branches while @xmath275 is such that @xmath276 at @xmath277 and @xmath278=\\tau_t({\\alpha})$ ] .",
    "the requirement that @xmath88 , @xmath279 determines two forbidden regions in the stability diagram:@xmath280 and @xmath281 , where @xmath282 ( see figure  [ fig : ns ] ) .",
    "the information about the forbidden regions can be visualized in parallel in the @xmath283 plane by drawing the curves @xmath284 and @xmath285 describing the intersections between @xmath286 and the borders of the forbidden regions , @xmath287 and @xmath288 , respectively ( dotted curves of figure  [ fig : nn ] ) . according to what we said so far ,",
    "these curves enclose two regions where one of the real roots of polynomial @xmath236 must be excluded from the set of solutions of system ( [ e : fpsys ] ) : @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "similarly two of these real roots must be discarded in the regions @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "notice also that @xmath293 [ @xmath294 is expectedly tangent to @xmath268 [ @xmath295 at @xmath296 , [ @xmath296 ] .",
    "_ local character of the nfp_. the study of the signature of both matrix @xmath217 and @xmath179 defined in ( [ e : mqp ] ) reveals that nfps are either maxima or saddle points depending on whether they lie within the region @xmath298 or elsewhere in the allowed zone . in parallel , the linear stability analysis based on polynomial @xmath299 ( see the discussion relevant to ( [ e : st_cond ] ) ) discloses the ( linear ) stability of most of the saddle points lying in the positive @xmath78 quadrant , namely the ones belonging to the light grey region of figure  [ fig : ns ] .",
    "indeed , within the allowed region @xmath300 , the stability condition ( [ e : st_cond ] ) fails to apply in the region @xmath301 , where @xmath302 , and in a peculiarly shaped region of the positive @xmath78 quadrant , where @xmath303 .",
    "since @xmath304 is positive everywhere outside these regions , it turns out that linear stability characterizes not only , as expected , the maxima , but also most of the saddle points at positive @xmath78 .",

    "indeed , no matter for the sign of @xmath306 , the quadratic form has always an undefined signature . recalling that @xmath307 , the coefficients involved stability condition ( [ e : st_cond ] ) have the quite simple form @xmath308/{\\tau^2}$ ] and @xmath309/{\\tau^2}$ ] yielding @xmath310/\\tau^4 $ ] .",

    "notice that , unlike figures  [ fig : ds ] and [ fig : ns ] , it is in the plane of the parameters , @xmath46 and @xmath45 .",
