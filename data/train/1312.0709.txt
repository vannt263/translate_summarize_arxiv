    "the notion of gravitational theory with a massive graviton is nothing new .",
    "a massive gravity theory was firstly proposed by fierz and pauli ( fp ) in 1939 where the theory of general relativity ( gr ) was extended by a linear mass term  @xcite .",
    "however , lack of hamiltonian and momentum constraints leads to 6 degrees of freedom in this theory , with 5 of which corresponding to those of a massive spin-2 graviton and the rest one a boulware - deser ( bd ) ghost mode  @xcite .",
    "a breakthrough was achieved by recent development of de rham - gabadadze - tolley ( drgt ) nonlinear massive gravity theory  @xcite , where a special form of potential was introduced to recover the hamiltonian constraint so that the sixth bd ghost mode is eliminated  @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable consequences in this theory is that it allows self - accelerating solutions  @xcite , where the universe takes the de sitter form even without a bare cosmological constant , and its hubble scale is of the order of the graviton mass .",
    "however , application of the self - accelerating solution to explain the current accelerated expansion of universe does not solve the `` cosmological constant problem '' ( ccp )  @xcite , which implies a serious contradiction between smallness of the cosmological constant and expected large quantum corrections . motivated by the proposal that ccp may hopefully be solved by the anthropic selection of the cosmological constant in the landscape of vacua  @xcite , the hawking - moss ( hm ) solution  @xcite in drgt massive gravity was studied in  @xcite .",
    "it was found that depending on the choice of parameters in drgt massive gravity theory , the non - vanishing mass of a graviton will influence the tunneling rate of hm instanton , hence affects the stability of a vacuum in this theory .    on the other hand ,",
    "it was known that in gr , traditionally , the hartle - hawking ( hh ) no - boundary wavefunction  @xcite exponentially prefers small number of @xmath2-foldings near the minimum of the inflaton potential , hence it does not seem to predict the universe we observe today .",
    "such situation may be drastically changed by application of the correction term in the euclidean hm action to hh no - boundary proposal .",
    "it was found that for a wide range choice of the parameters in drgt massive gravity theory , the no - boundary wavefunction can peak at a sufficiently large value of the hubble parameter , hence one may obtain a sufficient number of @xmath2-folds of inflation  @xcite .",
    "inspired by these interesting achievements , as a necessary step towards understanding of tunneling process in drgt massive gravity theory , it is necessary to explore another kind of phase transition in theories of scalar fields coupled to gravity : coleman - de luccia ( cdl ) instanton that exists for a special form of potentials such that the curvature scale of the barrier is large compared to the potential energy ( in planck units )  @xcite , and gradually approaches to the hm instanton as the curvature scale shrinks . in this paper",
    ", we consider the cdl solution for a scalar field with minimal coupling to gravity in drgt massive gravity theory .",
    "we set up the model and found the bounce solutions corresponding to the cdl instantons .",
    "based on these solutions , we evaluate the cdl action in two approaches : `` thin - wall '' approximation and perturbations around hm solution , and find monotonic contributions from the graviton mass terms until the `` thick - wall '' limit : the hm case .",
    "moreover , in the `` thin - wall '' limit , comparison of the tunneling rates for the hm and cdl solutions with the same potential shows that , even when the cdl process dominates over the hm one in the case of gr , it may behave inversely in the context of drgt massive gravity , i.e. depending on the values of parameters in this model , the hm process may dominate over the cdl one .",

    "<S> we study the coleman - de luccia ( cdl ) instanton characterizing the tunneling from a false vacuum to the true vacuum in a semi - classical way in drgt ( derham - gabadadze - tolley ) massive gravity theory , and evaluate the dependence of the tunneling rate on the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that provided with the same physical hubble parameters for the true vacuum @xmath0 and the false vacuum @xmath1 as in general relativity ( gr ) , the thin - wall approximation method implies the same tunneling rate as gr . </S>",
    "<S> however , deviations of tunneling rate from gr arise when one goes beyond the thin - wall approximation and they change monotonically until the hawking - moss ( hm ) case . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , under the thin - wall approximation , the hm process may dominate over the cdl one if the value for the graviton mass is larger than the inverse of the radius of the bubble . </S>"
