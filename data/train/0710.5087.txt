    "the nearest of all the giant radio galaxies , centaurus  a ( ngc  5128 ) provides a unique opportunity to observe the dynamics and morphology of an active galaxy in detail across the electromagnetic spectrum . for a recent review on this remarkable object",
    "see @xcite . in its central regions ,",
    "ngc  5128 exhibits a well recognized and optically - dark band of absorption across its nucleus .",
    "images from the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( sst ) with the infrared array camera ( irac ) and multiple imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) cameras in the mid - infrared reveal a 3long parallelogram shape @xcite that has been modeled as a series of folds in a dusty warped thin disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dusty disk is also the site of ongoing star formation at a rate of about @xmath5  yr@xmath6 , ( based on the infrared luminosity estimated by @xcite ) .",
    "centaurus  a hosts an active nucleus ( e.g. , @xcite ) that has been recently studied using infrared spectra from the sst . @xcite .",
    "its nucleus exhibits a strong silicate absorption feature and emission from [ nev ] .",
    "here we do not study the nucleus but focus on structure exterior to it .",
    "the irac and mips images of centaurus  a have revealed another surprise , a bipolar shell - like structure 500pc north and south of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "this shell , seen for the first time with spitzer imaging , could be the first extragalactic nuclear shell discovered in the infrared .    in this paper we present mapping of the central 500600pc of centaurus",
    "a done with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on board the sst .",
    "the infrared spectral maps were obtained to test the possibility that the apparent dust shell is a separate coherent structure and not a chance superposition of dust filaments .",
    "they were also obtained to search for possible interactions between the agn and the interstellar medium either by illumination from the agn or caused by jets or outflows .",
    "based on the discussion by @xcite , we adopt a distance to cen a of 3.4  mpc . at this distance , 1",
    "kpc corresponds to 1on the sky .",
    "all positions reported in this manuscript are given with respect to epoch 2000 .",
    "observations were obtained in spectral mapping mode in the short - low ( sl;514@xmath0 m ) resolution and long - high ( lh ; 19 - 38@xmath0 m ) resolution modules of the infrared spectrograph on board the sst .",
    "the spectral resolution of sl is @xmath7 whereas that of lh is @xmath8 . in spectral mapping mode",
    "the spitzer space craft points on a raster of discrete steps , settling at each position before the integrations begin .",
    "each map was accompanied by a 4 position offset observation taken with the same slit pattern and exposure sequence .",
    "the offset ( rogue ) positions were used for sky subtraction .",
    "the rogue sky position is at ra=13:25:15.7 ( epoch 2000 ) dec=-42:55:13 , approximately 6north of the nucleus and sufficiently far away that little emission from the galaxy was seen in the previously observed broad band irac and mips images .",
    "we mapped in the short low ( sl ) module of the infrared spectrograph using slit overlaps of 25@xmath91.85using a 60s ramp .",
    "one data set covers @xmath10 map positions ( through the guaranteed time observer program ; gto ) , and the other two cover @xmath11 map positions ( through the guest observer program ; go ) .",
    "both maps were observed by the sst on mar 13 , 2007 .",
    "spectral cube assembly , including background subtraction , bad pixel removal , spatial regridding and calibration was done using the software package cube builder for irs spectra maps , ( cubism ) @xcite producing a single spectral cube .",
    "we mapped in the long high spectral resolution ( lh ) module of the infrared spectrograph using slit overlaps of 10@xmath94.5 ,   so that central positions in the map were covered by four slit positions .",
    "we used a 60s ramp , and each observation contained 2 cycles . for central map positions",
    ", this corresponds to a 480s on source integration time .",
    "two data sets ( guest observer ; go ) were taken covering 6@xmath920 map positions .",
    "the third ( guaranteed time observer ; gto ) data set covers @xmath12 map positions .",
    "all three maps were observed by the sst on aug 1 , 2006 .",
    "data reduction of the three lh spectral data sets involved bad pixel removal , spectral extraction , spatial regridding , and application of the slit loss correction . for descriptions of the software procedures used",
    "see appendix a by @xcite .",
    "the resulting three data cubes were then resampled onto the same spatial grid and averaged into a single cube , resulting in 1440s on source exposure times for central positions in the map .",
    "we have extracted continuum images from both spectral cubes to check that they are consistent with previous broad band imaging and to bring attention to features noted in previous studies @xcite and that we will discuss below .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cont25 ] we show the morphology of the continuum emission in @xmath13 m wide bands centered at 25@xmath0 m and 32@xmath0 m from the long - high spectral cube .",
    "we chose these regions so as to be free from artifacts caused by order separation and emission lines .",
    "the morphology at 25@xmath0 m is consistent with the morphology seen in the broad band mips @xmath14 m image previously presented by @xcite .",
    "the broad band of emission approximately 30wide , and stretching approximately along the east - west direction across the galaxy nucleus we refer to as ` the parallelogram ' ( see figure 3 by @xcite ) .",
    "the parallelogram shape is due to folds in a thin dusty warped disk .",
    "the warped disk is also rich in molecular gas @xcite and so is the site of most active star formation present in the galaxy .    in the sl spectral",
    "cube , broad and prominent dust emission features are present .",
    "these dust emission features are generally attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "these dominate the broad band emission in the irac broad band images previously studied @xcite except possibly at the nucleus . in figure",
    "[ fig : pah11 ] we show the morphology of the peak of the @xmath15 m dust emission feature extracted from the sl spectral cube .",
    "this map also shows the parallelogram shape or star forming disk seen in the irac band images . above and below the parallelogram",
    "we can see the shell - like bipolar structure described by @xcite that was most prominent in the irac @xmath16 m image .",
    "this shell has a major axis of @xmath17 , a minor axis of @xmath18 and position angle of approximately @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the irac 8.0@xmath0 m band image is dominated by the pah dust emission feature at 7.7@xmath0 m and so it is not surprising that the 11.3@xmath0 m image shows similar morphology .",
    "we show an image at 11.3@xmath0 m here because it most clearly reveals the dust shell .",
    "the morphology at 7.7@xmath0 m and other pah emission features and their ratios will be discussed in more detail below . in the next section",
    "we will compare the morphology in line emission maps to that seen in continuum ( figure [ fig : cont25 ] ) and in the dust emission features .    in the @xmath20 m continuum image ( figure [ fig : cont25]a )",
    "three peaks in the emission are seen , 2 to the west of the nucleus , one to south - east .",
    "a weaker but fourth is located directly east of the nucleus .",
    "these are labeled with arrows on the 24@xmath0 m image in figure 2 by @xcite .",
    "we bring these to the attention of the reader as we extract spectra from these higher surface brightness regions to represent conditions typical of the star forming disk .",
    "we will show that spectra extracted from regions above or below the parallelogram region differ from those extracted from the star forming disk or parallelogram shaped region .",
    "line emission images were created by summing emission near the line peak and subtracting nearby continuum .",
    "these images are shown in figures [ fig : ssi ]  [ fig : h2s0 ] for lines present in the long wavelength spectral data cube and in figures [ fig : h2s3 ]  [ fig : neii ] for lines or dust emission features present in the sl spectral data cube .",
    "line identifications and rest frame wavelengths are summarized in table [ tab : lines ] .",
    "the lines [ siii](@xmath21 m ) and [ siii](@xmath22 m ) ( as displayed in figure [ fig : ssi ] ) are strong in the parallelogram or star forming disk , as would be expected from the presence of hii regions in this disk .",
    "peaks in these maps are approximately coincident with peaks seen in the nearby continuum at @xmath23 m ( figure [ fig : cont25]b ) .",
    "the [ feii](@xmath24 m ) and [ feiii](22.93@xmath0 m ) lines are also detected in the same region with [ feiii ] weaker than [ feii ] ( figure [ fig : fe ] ) .",
    "molecular hydrogen in the h@xmath25s(0)@xmath260(@xmath27 m ) line is also detected associated with star formation in the warped disk or parallelogram ( figure [ fig : h2s0 ] ) though the morphology in this line differs from that seen in the [ siii ] , [ siii ] , and [ feii ] lines .",
    "the northwestern and southeastern ridges of the parallelogram are stronger than the southwestern and northern ridges .",
    "the northwestern and southeastern ridges also seem to be brighter in the [ feii ] map .",
    "the emission lines present in the long wavelength spectral cube are clearly associated with the disk , however there are differences between these maps and the nearby continuum .",
    "there is more structure seen in the [ siii ] map than present in nearby continuum at 32@xmath0 m ; peaks in the disk are brighter than the surrounding emission in the parallelogram ( compare figure [ fig : ssi ] to [ fig : cont25]b ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the 4 peaks in the broad band @xmath14 m images were due to a superposition of the shell and the star forming disk .",
    "however the emission lines at long wavelengths are not detected in the vicinity of the shell - like structure but do display the four emission peaks ( particularly the [ siii ] line image ) .",
    "therefore that explanation for the 4 peaks seen at 24@xmath0 m is probably incorrect .",
    "those peaks were not predicted by the warped disk model presented by @xcite .",
    "the peaks are symmetrical about the nucleus suggesting that they are due to projection of a warped disk and that improvements in the warp model might succeed in accounting for them . if this were the case then the size of the peaks should be similar in the continuum and line emission .",
    "unfortunately the peaks are more prominent in some of the lines ( e.g. , [ siii ] ) than the nearby continuum .",
    "spiral structure in the warped disk could cause particular regions in the disk to exhibit higher levels of star formation and could maintain the reflective symmetry .",
    "if this were the case then variations in the observed morphology between lines and continuum would require a model in which the strength of spiral structure depends on wavelength .",
    "the [ siii ] , [ siii ] and [ feii ] emission are primarily confined to the warped disk ( or parallelogram shape ) .",
    "however the [ neii](12.8@xmath0 m ) image ( see figure [ fig : neii ] ) does show faint levels of emission ( at the level of @xmath28erg  @xmath2s@xmath6sr@xmath6 ) associated with the dust shell .",
    "this line is blended with the nearby 12.7@xmath0 m dust emission feature , nevertheless the shape of the spectrum at different locations suggests that [ neii ] dominates the dust emission and is present above and below the galaxy disk . if so then the [ siii ] , [ siii ] and [ feii ] emission associated with the dust shell is just too faint to see in the long wavelength spectral cube .",
    "deeper observations at longer wavelengths or higher spectral resolution short wavelength infrared observations would be needed to confirm the presence of ionized gas in the shell .",
    "a spectroscopic study at visible band wavelengths would be quite sensitive as extinction is probably not high in the shell region above and below the parallelogram .",
    "lines requiring higher ionization , [ oiv](@xmath29 m ) and [ nev](@xmath30 m ) , are also detected in the lh spectral cube and they exhibit different morphology than the lower ionization lines . emission from [ oiv ] and [ nev ] is strong along position angles of @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the nucleus and is resolved at locations outside the nucleus ; see figure [ fig : oivnev ] .",
    "these position angles are within 15@xmath33 of the jet axis , though the jet is seen prominently only on the north - east side in radio emission .",
    "the radio and x - ray jets in this region have a position angle of @xmath34 @xcite . in figure [ radioo4 ]",
    "we show contours of radio continuum at 5 ghz by @xcite overlayed on the [ oiv](@xmath29 m ) emission map ( shown in grayscale ) .",
    "we find that the position angle of the [ oiv ] differs from the jet axis by @xmath35 .",
    "the different between the axis of the [ oiv ] emission and radio jet axis is perhaps not surprising .",
    "observations of seyfert galaxies have found that the jet axis can differ from that of an ionization cone ( ngc 1068 , for example ) .",
    "high angular resolution observations of the central few arcseconds of centaurus a have revealed elongated or cone - shaped emission in pa@xmath36 , pa@xmath37 and [ feii](1.26@xmath0 m ) north of the nucleus that has been interpreted in terms of a rotating disk , rather than in terms of an ionization cone @xcite .",
    "the jet axis lies on the western side of the possible ionization cone seen in [ feii](1.26 ) .",
    "the [ oiv ] and [ nev ] extension to the north of the galaxy nucleus are approximately oriented in the same direction as the cone seen in [ feii](1.26@xmath0 m ) shown by @xcite . as there is no cone feature seen in the near - infrared [ feii ] observations south of the nucleus ( likely because the band of absorption caused by the warped disk ) it is more difficult to compare the cone to the [ oiv ] emission south - west of the nucleus .",
    "the [ oiv ] emission north and south of the nucleus are not @xmath38 apart and the emission south - west of the nucleus would not overlay the [ feii](1.26 ) possibly ionization cone if rotated by @xmath38 .",
    "it is interesting to reinspect the morphology of the lower ionization line maps at the position of the peak in [ oiv ] south west of the nucleus .",
    "an extension in the contours of the [ siii ] , [ siii ] , [ feii ] [ feiii ] and h@xmath25s(0 ) emission line brightness is seen at the same location as the peak south - west of the nucleus in the [ oiv ] map .",
    "the ratio of the surface brightness in the extension compared to that in the disk is higher in the [ feiii ] line compared to the [ feii ] line .",
    "this is not surprising as we know these extensions contain higher ionization species such as [ nev ] .",
    "the spectral resolution in the lh spectral cube ( a spectral resolution of @xmath39 corresponds to a velocity resolution of @xmath40km / s ) is sufficiently high that we can just barely see the galactic disk s rotation in the brighter lines ( e.g. , [ siii ] , [ siii ] and h@xmath25s(0 ) ) , with the western and eastern sides of the disk redshifted or blueshifted , respectively , compared to the system velocity .",
    "we inspected the channels near the line centers and searched for evidence of structure in the radial velocity distribution .",
    "we found no clear evidence for a significant ( greater than @xmath41km / s ) red or blue shift in the [ oiv ] emission extensions compared to the system velocity .",
    "we also saw no clear evidence for an increase in line width .",
    "the line width ( fwhm ) must be smaller than the galactic rotation full width or @xmath42km / s .",
    "near the [ oiv ] peak south - west of the nucleus the extensions in the contours of the [ siii ] , [ siii ] , and h@xmath25s(0 ) also appear to have velocities within 200km / s of the system velocity .",
    "unfortunately the spectral resolution is just not high enough to be certain about these line widths or allow a search for structure in the radial velocity distribution .      in the sl spectral",
    "cube we detect four pure rotational molecular hydrogen lines , the s(7)@xmath435 , the s(5)@xmath443 , the s(3)@xmath451 and the s(2)@xmath260 lines .",
    "we show the continuum subtracted line emission maps for the h@xmath25s(5)(6.909@xmath0 m ) and h@xmath25s(3)(9.665@xmath0 m ) lines in figure [ fig : h2s3 ] .",
    "the s(7 ) is weak and the s(2 ) strongly blended with dust emission features so we have only presented line emission maps from the other two lines .",
    "the s(4 ) line at 8.0251@xmath0 m was not detected , probably due to the bright dust emission feature at 7.7@xmath0 m at its expected wavelength and because the even number transitions are singlets rather than triplets and so have one third the number of states .",
    "the s(1 ) line at 17.03@xmath0 m was not detected because it lies outside the spectral range covered by the sl and lh modules . to observe this line we would have needed observations with the sh module of the infrared spectrograph .",
    "the morphology of the higher s(3 ) and s(5 ) rotational molecular hydrogen lines differs from that we see at longer wavelengths in the s(0 ) line at 28@xmath0 m ( compare figure [ fig : h2s0 ] to figure [ fig : h2s3_ov ] ) .",
    "the s(0 ) line is primarily associated with the star forming disk , however the s(3 ) and s(5 ) lines are seen above the disk .",
    "an overlay of the h@xmath25s(3)(9.665@xmath0 m ) line and [ oiv](25.89@xmath0 m ) in figure [ fig : h2s3_ov]a shows that the peak in the [ oiv ] south - west of the nucleus coincides with the peak h@xmath25s(3 ) surface brightness in the same region .",
    "an overlay shown in figure [ fig : h2s3_ov]b of the s(3 ) line with the dust emission in the 11.3@xmath0 pah emission feature ( previously shown in figure [ fig : pah11 ] ) shows that the warmer molecular hydrogen gas ( traced by the higher s pure rotational transitions ) is near the dust shell .",
    "the simplest explanation for the morphology is that warmer molecular hydrogen is associated with the dust shell but that there is additional excitation of the shell material near the jet axis .",
    "constraints on the column depth and temperature of the molecular hydrogen are discussed below in section 5 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : pah ] and figure [ fig : neii ] we show maps of continuum emission at the peak of the 7.7 , and 8.6@xmath0 m dust emission features and the [ neii]12.81@xmath0 m line .",
    "we did not subtract continuum from these maps as the [ neii ] line and dust emission feature are 3 - 8 times brighter than the continuum .",
    "as expected , the [ neii ] line and dust emission features primarily trace the star forming regions in the warped disk .",
    "fainter levels of emission arise from the dust shell above and below the disk and from the region that is bright in [ oiv ] emission ( @xmath4625south west of the nucleus ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : ratio ] we show ratios of the 7.7@xmath0 m and 11.3@xmath0 m surface brightness and the ratio of the [ neii]12.8 and 11.3@xmath0 m surface brightness . both of these ratios exhibit variations across the galaxy , with the lowest values in the dust shell and higher values present in the star forming disk .",
    "subtraction of the continuum made little difference in the morphology of the ratio maps because the lines and dust emission features are over twice as strong as the continuum .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between the 7.7/11.3@xmath0 m ratio of dust emission complexes and the [ neiii](15.6)/[neii](12.8@xmath0 m ) ratio in star forming galaxies .",
    "they also noted that the galaxies with low 7.7/11.3 complex ratios were more likely to be classified as liners or seyferts .",
    "they suggested that the 7.7@xmath0m/11.3@xmath0 m ratio is an indicator of the hardness of the radiation field .",
    "the [ neiii](15.6@xmath0 m ) line lies is outside the wavelength coverage of the sl module so we can not use that ratio to probe the radiation field above the disk . at the nucleus in cen",
    "a , this line was detected but was not strong @xcite .",
    "we do have higher ionization tracers in the the [ oiv](25.9@xmath0 m ) and [ nev](24.3@xmath0 m ) lines .",
    "however , the morphology in those lines differs from that we see in the the 7.7 to 11.3@xmath0 m ratio map .",
    "the [ oiv ] line is bright near the jet axis whereas whereas the 7.7/11.3 ratio is low in the dustshell ( see figure [ fig : ratio ] ) .",
    "the lack of change in the 7.7/11.3 ratio in the region containing [ oiv]25.9 and [ nev]24.3 emission near the jet axis makes it difficult to interpret variations in the 7.7/11.3 ratio purely in terms of hardness of radiation field . since the 7.7/11.3 ratio drops in the vicinity of the dust shell and this is where we detect warm molecular gas we might instead consider models in which pah emission is affected by the presence of warm gas or the physical process that is responsible for heating the warm gas .",
    "we could also consider models where this ratio is affected by the ambient radiation field strength .",
    "we have extracted spectra at various positions in the star forming disk from the lh spectral cube and these are shown in figure [ fig : lhspec]a .",
    "spectra were extracted from 7square regions centered at 5 regions .",
    "4 of these correspond to peaks evident in figure [ fig : ssi ] excluding the nucleus . from bottom",
    "to top the spectra shown in figure [ fig : lhspec]a were extracted from regions centered at ra=13:25:25.8 , dec=-43 00 52 ( peak to the west and north of the nucleus ) , ra=13:25:25.9 , dec=-43:01:09 ( peak west of the nucleus ) , ra=13:25:29.5 , dec=-43:01:27 ( south - east of the nucleus ) , ra=13 25 29.5 , dec=-43:01:10 ( peak east of the nucleus ) , and ra=13:25:28.6 , dec=-43:01:23 ( peak south - east of the nucleus ) .",
    "we also extract an lh spectrum along the jet axis at the peak shown in fig.[fig : lhspec]b .",
    "this spectrum was extracted over a 11square region centered at ra=13:25:25.7 , dec=-43:01:24 , at the peak in the [ oiv ] emission south - west of the nucleus ( see figure [ fig : oivnev ] ) .",
    "the lines we have detected from these spectra are listed in table [ tab : lines ] .",
    "line fluxes measured from this region are listed in tables [ tab : emjet ] and [ tab : hjet ] .",
    "we see only minor differences in different regions of the parallelogram ( see figure [ fig : lhspec ] ) . however , along the jet axis there are deviations in the spectra , in the relative strengths of the lines requiring higher levels of ionization , [ oiv](@xmath29 m ) and [ nev](@xmath30 m ) , compared to those requiring lower levels ( e.g. , [ siii](@xmath21 m ) , [ siii](@xmath22 m ) ) . to produce the emitting ion from the preceding ionization state , [ oiv ] requires an ionization energy of 54.0ev where as [ nev ] requires 97.1ev . a harder uv radiation field",
    "most naturally accounts for these species .    in the sl spectral cube we extracted a spectrum from the same bright region along the jet axis south - west of the nucleus as that shown in figure [ fig : lhspec]b and from a representative region in the parallelogram representing the star forming disk .",
    "the spectrum representing the star forming disk was extracted from a position centered at ra=13:25:25.9 , dec=-43:01:09 .",
    "the location is the same as that for the second from bottom spectrum shown in figure [ fig : lhspec ] .",
    "the two spectra extracted from the sl spectral cube are shown in figure [ fig : slspec ] .    as can be seen from figure [ fig : slspec]a the star forming region exhibits little molecular hydrogen emission in the higher s rotational lines .",
    "however , the s(2 ) , s(3 ) , and s(5 ) lines are detected near the jet axis and above the disk near the dust shell ( see figure [ fig : slspec]b ) .",
    "the s(7 ) line is barely detected at 5.511@xmath0 m .",
    "the s(4 ) line at 8.0241 is not detected likely because it has been overpowered by the dust emission feature at 7.7@xmath0 m .",
    "likewise the s(6 ) line at 6.1086@xmath0 m is not detected as it would have been overpowered by the dust emission feature at 6.2@xmath0 m .",
    "the s(5 ) line is detected above the disk but not in the star forming region at 6.909@xmath0 m ( figure [ fig : slspec]b ) . at almost the same wavelength the [ arii ] line at 6.985@xmath0 m is seen in the star forming disk .",
    "the spectra are sufficiently high spectral resolution that we can differ between the two lines .",
    "a comparison between the two spectra also shows that the relative heights of the 7.7 and 11.3@xmath0 m dust emission features differs .",
    "these two dust emission features are approximately the same height in the star forming disk .",
    "however the 11.3@xmath0 m emission feature is twice as bright as the 7.7@xmath0 m dust emission feature in the dust shell .",
    "the [ neii](12.81@xmath0 m ) and dust emission feature at 11.3@xmath0 m are also similar in height in the star forming region but",
    "the 11.3@xmath0 m is almost twice as bright as [ neii ] above the disk .",
    "these changes are reflected in the ratio maps shown in figure [ fig : ratio ] and discussed in section 3 .",
    "there is a weak feature near 14.2@xmath0 m in both spectra from the star forming disk and jet region ( figure [ fig : slspec]a , b ) .",
    "the shape of the spectra are similar in shape at 14.2@xmath0 m suggesting that this feature is a dust emission feature rather than due to emission from [ nev](14.3@xmath0 m ) .",
    "a higher spectral resolution spectrum would be required to detect this line .",
    "weak [ nev](14.3@xmath0 m ) emission was detected in the sh spectrum of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "we have measured line fluxes from the spectra shown in figures [ fig : lhspec]b and [ fig : slspec]b which were extracted at the location of the [ oiv ] peak south - west of the nucleus .",
    "table [ tab : emjet ] lists the fluxes of the emission lines from ions and table [ tab : hjet ] lists the fluxes of the pure rotational molecular hydrogen transitions .",
    "line fluxes were measured from the 3 spectral cubes in the same aperture using continuum fitting and subtraction routines available in cubism .",
    "we have used cubism to measure line fluxes for the lh spectral cube even though the images ( displayed in our figures ) show the spectral cube reduced with the software described by @xcite .",
    "this spectral cube had fewer artifacts than the one produced by cubism , however the artifacts in the cubism reduced lh spectral cube should not have affected the measured line fluxes as we were able to choose where to measure the continuum and line emission .",
    "also the same software package was used to measure all line fluxes to check and ensure consistency in the calibration between the spectral cubes .",
    "pure rotational transitions of molecular hydrogen in the mid - infrared ( between 3 and 20@xmath0 m ) are a major coolant of of warm gas in the temperature range 100 - 1000k @xcite .",
    "higher s pure rotation molecular hydrogen lines have previously been detected in extragalactic objects . @xcite",
    "detected pure rotational lines from ulirgs including the s(7 ) line in a few objects .",
    "@xcite detected these lines in the elliptical galaxy ngc 4435 that is experiencing an off - center encounter with a nearby galaxy .",
    "this galaxy hosts a dusty disk as seen from visible band hst images and ongoing star formation at modest rate of @xmath47yr . @xcite",
    "observed warm gas in the centers of nearby galaxies with liners and seyferts having warmer h@xmath25 emitting in the excited states or higher s transitions .",
    "the above studies did not resolve the h@xmath25 emission or did not study its morphology .",
    "higher angular resolution near infrared studies have found emission from molecular hydrogen in vibrational transitions in active galaxies . in some seyferts",

    "the detection of [ nev ] suggests that a hard radiation field is illuminating the dust shell near the jet axis .",
    "however we have failed to detect [ nev](14.3@xmath0 m ) or [ nevi](7.65@xmath0 m ) suggesting that the illuminated region is low density and has a low ionization parameter .",
    "the difference in the physical conditions compared to those expected in narrow line regions might account for the discrepancy between the [ oiv]25.9/[neii]12.8 and [ oiv]25.9/[siii]33.5 ratios compared to those seen in agns .",
    "we consider the possibility that the low electron density and ionization parameter are consistent with illumination of a region distant from the nucleus by hard radiation from the central agn .",

    "the active nucleus is estimated to have a bolometric luminosity of @xmath89 erg / s @xcite .",
    "the ionization parameter , @xmath90 , for isotropic emission is @xmath91 where @xmath50 is the speed of light , @xmath92 is the ionizing photon emission rate ( photons per second ) and @xmath93 is the gas density ( in @xmath87 ) . assuming a mean energy for ionizing photons of 100ev ( the estimated energy of the uv bump and hard enough to produce nev from the preceding ionization state ) at the estimated bolometric luminosity emitted isotropically into @xmath94 radians , @xmath95 this estimate illustrates that a low ionization parameter , low density medium ( such as we infer from the line ratios ) is the only situation that we might expect at a distance of 400  pc from the agn .",
    "we now ask : can the agn nucleus provide enough uv photons to account for the flux of the [ oiv ] emission 25from the nucleus ?",
    "we summed the [ oiv](25.9@xmath0 m ) flux in a 15wide region centered on the [ oiv ] emission peak , estimating a flux of @xmath96  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath6 in the line .",
    "this flux corresponds to a luminosity in [ oiv ] of @xmath97 erg / s .",
    "we can compare the [ oiv ] luminosity to the mid - infrared luminosity as have @xcite for other objects .",
    "since the [ oiv ] flux is illuminated only in a small solid angle from the nucleus we must first estimate the fraction of uv luminosity that could be causing the [ oiv ] emission .",
    "the [ oiv ] emission comes from a region that is about 10wide .",
    "as viewed from the position of the nucleus , this corresponds to a solid angle of @xmath98 or @xmath99% of @xmath94 steradians .",
    "thus we compare the [ oiv ] luminosity to 1% of the mid - infrared luminosity .",
    "the mid - infrared luminosity of the agn is @xmath100erg  s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "consequently we estimate that the ratio of the [ oiv ] to 1% of the mid - infrared luminosity is @xmath101 .",
    "this ratio is similar to that seen for the brighter seyferts studied by @xcite ( see their figure 12 ) .",
    "we conclude that as long as they are not absorbed before they run into the dust shell , uv photons from the agn can account for the [ oiv ] and [ nev ] emission near the jet axis .",
    "an additional power source ( like shocks associated with the jet ) is not necessarily required to account for the high ionization species seen near the jet axis but distant from the nucleus . if uv photons from the agn are responsible for the high ionization species then the column depth along the sight line between the agn and dust shell must be low . if a blast wave is responsible for sweeping up the dust shell , as proposed by @xcite , then it could also be responsible for evacuating material between the agn and the dust shell .",
    "we have carried out a spectroscopic study of the central 2 arcminutes of centaurus a using short low and long high spectral modules of the infrared spectrograph on board the _ spitzer space telescope_. most of the emission lines detected in the spectral cubes ( e.g. , [ siii](33.5@xmath0 m ) , [ siii](34.8 ) , [ feii](26.0 ) , [ feiii](23.9 ) , [ arii](6.98 ) and h@xmath25s(0)(28.2 ) ) and dust emission features primarily trace regions of star formation in the warped disk .",
    "our previous study based on irac and mips imaging suggested that centaurus a hosts an oval or bipolar dustshell at a distance approximately 500 pc from the nucleus seen above and below the warped disk .",
    "this dust shell , if confirmed , would be the first extragalactic shell to be discovered in the infrared .",
    "here we see the dust shell even more clearly and prominently in the 11.3@xmath0 m dust emission feature than we saw previously in the broad band irac images .",
    "we have found variations in the dust emission feature 7.7@xmath0m/11.3@xmath0 m ratio and dust 11.3@xmath0m/[neii](12.8@xmath0 ) ratio , with the oval dust shell having the lowest ratios compared to the star forming disk .",
    "the clearer shell morphology at 11.3@xmath0 m than previously seen in broad band images , the association of the molecular hydrogen emission in the shell , and the variation in line ratios in the shell compared to those in the disk , confirm spectroscopically that the shell discovered previously @xcite is a separate coherent entity and is unlikely to be a chance superposition of dust filaments .",
    "we find evidence for higher ionization species line emission in [ nev](@xmath30 m ) and [ oiv](@xmath29 m ) near the jet axis .",
    "emission in these two lines is seen both north - east and south - west of the nucleus along position angles @xmath31 and @xmath102 .",
    "these angles are similar to but not exactly the same as the jet axis at 55@xmath33 as seen at 5ghz . outside the nucleus ,",
    "the peak surface brightness in these lines is 25or 400  pc south - west of the nucleus .",
    "emission line ratios and limits at the location of the [ oiv ] peak suggest that the emitting region is at low ionization parameter , @xmath84 , and has low electron density , @xmath86@xmath87 .",
    "we crudely estimate that the agn can provide sufficient uv photons to account for the [ oiv ] luminosity 400  pc from the nucleus , as long as uv photons are not absorbed by intervening material as they travel from the agn to the dust shell .",
    "a much more detailed photo - ionization study is required to understand the excitation of the [ oiv ] and [ nev ] emission .",
    "previous reports of an ionization cone in cen a were based on near - infrared imaging of the central few arcseconds @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies interpreted line emission in terms of a disk rather than ionization cone @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the morphology of the near - infrared images is strongly affected by extinction and the warp disk models have not been good enough to accurately predict the extinction in the central few arcsecond of the nucleus . cen a might be the only active galaxy in which mid - infrared spectroscopy has found evidence for high ionization species such as nev at hundred pc distances from the nucleus .",
    "as far as we know cen a hosts the only ionization cone that has been resolved with observations from the spitzer space telescope .",
    "we see evidence for warm molecular hydrogen coincident with the peak in [ oiv ] in the odd pure rotational odd transitions s(3 ) and s(5 ) .",
    "the s(7 ) and s(2 ) transitions are also detected but at weaker levels .",
    "the s(3 ) and s(5 ) emission also lies in the vicinity of the dust shell that is most prominent in the 11.3@xmath0 m dust ( pah ) emission feature .",
