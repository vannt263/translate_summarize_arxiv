    "we determine the continuum for the calculation of both properties by fitting the spectrum with a 3rd to 5th order polynomial with the fit anchored at 5.61 - 7.94@xmath1 m , 13.02 - 13.50@xmath1 m , 14.32 - 14.80@xmath1 m , 30.16 - 32.19@xmath1 m and 35.07 - 35.92@xmath1 m which @xcite showed to be free of distinct silicate emission features . for objects where a single polynomial did not produce an adequate fit , we used two polynomials to fit the continuum from 5 - 14@xmath1 m and 14 - 36@xmath1 m .",
    "for a few cases a smoothly varying fit which did not exceed the extinction corrected flux of the spectrum could not be found .",
    "for these objects the equivalent width and integrated flux from the portion of the spectrum for which a satisfactory fit could not found are left out of our analysis .",
    "we calculate ew@xmath86 , ew@xmath87 , f@xmath86 and f@xmath87 as well as their uncertainties for 44 of the 57 disk dominated objects with no evidence of an envelope as discussed in   [ vert ] ; these values are listed in table  [ tbl4 ] .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in these calculations results from the continuum fit , the uncertainties noted in table  [ tbl4 ] are calculated assuming an uncertainty in the continuum fit of 10% , though in some cases the uncertainty is likely to be larger .",
    "a continuum fit successfully extracting the 33@xmath1 m crystalline forsterite feature could not be found for all but a few of the spectra as a result of significant uncertainty at wavelengths @xmath88 30@xmath1 m as discussed in",
    "  [ vert ] , therefore we do not discuss this feature in our analysis .    the ew can be used to identify ptds which have gaps which result in a deficit of optically thick emission @xcite .",
    "equivalent width measures optically thin emission with respect to optically thick emission , therefore for the same amount of optically thin emission , a lack of optically thick emission would manifest itself in a large ew .",
    "if the gaps have some amount of optically thin dust this will further enhance their ability to be identified by having a large ew . in figure  [ w10_n1331 ]",
    "we plot @xmath59 vs. ew@xmath86 for our sample and the taurus sample from @xcite , along with a polygon indicating the boundaries in these indices which correspond to boundaries found by the models of radially continuous , irradiated disks described in   [ vert ] .",
    "these boundaries are a function of the parameters varied in the models ( e.g. , @xmath60 , m@xmath63 and disk inclination ) .",
    "we also note that the ew@xmath86 depends on the settling parameter,@xmath67 which we also varied in the models .",
    "objects with ew@xmath86 and @xmath59 which fall outside of this polygon have an interrupted radial structure , meaning the disk has one or more gaps or is inwardly or outwardly truncated .",
    "this is reflected the positions of the well modeled tds and ptds in taurus such as coku tau/4 , gm aur and lkca 15 .",
    "figure  [ polygon ] demonstrates the areas outside the polygon of radially continuous disk models which generally correspond to disks with altered radial structure in taurus , chamaeleon i and ophiuchus which have been modeled @xcite .",
    "first , we examine the disks which are extreme outliers in ew@xmath86 through the criterion that their ew@xmath86 is in the top 12.5% . using this restrictive criterion",
    "we identify # 50 , 52 , 57 , 73 and 116 as ptds . as discussed previously , objects which are likely to be tds possess a large @xmath59 , greater than that of the radially continuous disk models . while # 110 falls within the ptd range in figure  [ n26_n1331 ] ,",
    "it is certainly not an outlier in ew@xmath86 , though it is an outlier in @xmath59 reinforcing its previous classification as a td .",
    "curiously , # 110 has a position in figure  [ w10_n1331 ] similar to ux tau a , a ptd which has been modeled to have no optically thin dust in the gap resulting in a small ew@xmath86 @xcite .",
    "we can not confirm nor exclude this possibility without detailed modeling .",
    "all disks which were in the ptd range of figure  [ n26_n1331 ] , except for # 110 , fall within the polygon of the models in figure  [ w10_n1331 ] .",
    "the other td in the ptd range from figure  [ n26_n1331 ] , # 101 , falls just within the polygon of radially continuous , irradiated disk models in figure  [ w10_n1331 ] though its uncertainty in @xmath59 crosses the top boundary . of the other disks in the ptd range in figure  [ n26_n1331 ] , # 75 and 134 have ew@xmath86 greater than the median , though are not in the upper 12.5% , therefore are not large enough to be considered significant outliers .",
    "the classification of # 137 as a td from figure  [ n512_n1220 ] and figure  [ n26_n1331 ] , is bolstered here as its position in figure  [ w10_n1331 ] places it outside the polygon of radially continuous disk models and in the td range .",
    "our analysis agrees with that of @xcite which classifies # 137 ( known therein as source 5 or sstc2d j032929.3 + 311835 ) as a cold disk.    the td suggested by @xcite which did not fall in the td range of figure  [ n26_n1331 ] , is also not unique here in it falls within the polygon of models .",
    "though this object has a ` normal ' @xmath59 , examination of it sed shows it is a td .",
    "the sed of # 136 is photospheric @xmath3 9@xmath1 m and the continuum slightly rises toward the long wavelength side of the spectrum .",
    "we interpret this as a sign of a large central hole size , relatively cool outer disk wall , and a settled low mass outer disk .",
    "both the large inner hole and the low - mass settled outer disk prevent # 136 from being identified as a td based on @xmath59 .",
    "the case of # 136 suggests @xmath59 can pick out some tds though others can have an @xmath59 similar to that of a radially continuous disk .",
    "the spectral indices @xmath59 and @xmath72 are only good at identifying tds with a certain range of hole sizes .",
    "if the hole is too small ( @xmath101 au ) or too big ( @xmath8850 au ) the indices will not identify them as tds .",

    "a small value of @xmath90 , namely @xmath11 1% , indicates the quantities are significantly correlated .",
    "the f@xmath86 vs. ew@xmath86 plot shows most of the ptds have large values of f@xmath86 as well as an enhanced ew@xmath86 .",
    "a handful of disks have similar f@xmath86 values as the ptds but have much smaller ew@xmath86",
    ". objects with enhanced ew@xmath86 in ophiuchus @xcite and chamaeleon i @xcite show similar values of f@xmath86 to radially continuous disks , which suggests these objects have a deficit in optically thick emission as a result of a gap in their disk .",
    "interestingly , the disk with the highest f@xmath86 also has the highest ew@xmath86 in ngc 1333 , which is not seen in ophiuchus and chamaeleon i. the tds in ngc 1333 have low f@xmath86 , also the case for tds in ophiuchus and chamaeleon i. the flux at 10@xmath1 m comes from the inner regions of the disk , therefore a significantly cleared inner disk , as is the case for tds , would result in a lack of emission at 10@xmath1 m .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ w10_f10_w20 ] compares ew@xmath86 and ew@xmath87 and shows the two trace each other well , with @xmath89 = 0.32 and @xmath91 = 6.1% .",
    "all of the ptds , which have enhanced ew@xmath86 , fall above the median for ew@xmath87 .",
    "however most of the ptds have a lower ew@xmath87 than ew@xmath86 which is also seen in chamaeleon i. a large gap would affect the underlying optically thick emission contributing to ew@xmath87 as well as ew@xmath86 .",
    "this trend in lower ew@xmath87 with ew@xmath86 outliers possibly suggests most of these ew@xmath86 outliers have small gaps in the inner disk which only affect the ew@xmath86 . as discussed in   [ indices_geometry ] , the small nature of these gaps would cause them to be more difficult to identify as ptds with the @xmath72 vs. @xmath59 analysis ( figure  [ n26_n1331 ] ) . as was the case in ophiuchus and chamaeleon i , the trends of the continuum indices , fluxes and flux ratios with ew@xmath87",
    "are weaker versions of the trends with ew@xmath86 .",
    "most of the scatter in ew@xmath87 is due to the uncertainty in the continuum fit for the 20@xmath1 m feature .",

    "an f@xmath92/f@xmath93 representative of the processing of dust in the disk of object # 110 was impossible to obtain due to contamination of f@xmath93 by residual molecular hydrogen emission not removed by sky subtraction .",
    "in figure  [ w10_f11f9 ] we plot f@xmath92/f@xmath93 against ew@xmath86 .",
    "the objects with the highest values of f@xmath92/f@xmath93 correspond to the lowest ew strength , which is characteristic of radially continuous disks .",
    "this inverse relationship has pearson @xmath89 = -0.34 and @xmath90 = 2.4% .",
    "we also notice the trend that as ew@xmath86 decreases the frequency of disks with high f@xmath92/f@xmath93 increases .",
    "this trend is seen in taurus @xcite , ophiuchus @xcite and chamaeleon i @xcite , as well as in other regions @xcite . also , the ptds have relatively low f@xmath92/f@xmath93 , with most of them falling below the median and close to the pristine line .",
    "this would imply in general the dust seen in the ptds has experienced less grain growth and/or crystallization than the radially continuous disks .",
    "therefore the optically thin dust at 1 - 2 au in ptds is more pristine than radially continuous disks .",
    "the trend in low f@xmath92/f@xmath93 ( more pristine shape ) in outliers in ew@xmath86 is also seen in models of ptds @xcite and observation of ptds in taurus @xcite , ophiuchus @xcite and chamaeleon i @xcite .",
    "modeling suggests the emission responsible for the shape and strength of the 10@xmath1 m silicate feature in these disks comes from the optically thin dust within the gaps or in the surface layers of the outer disk wall @xcite .",
    "as also seen in chamaeleon i , the disks with @xmath59 below -4/3 in ngc 1333 show a slight preference toward higher values of f@xmath92/f@xmath93 which implies these truncated or optically thin disks have a higher degree of dust processing than tds or ptds .",
    "we use a one dimensional two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test to determine if the distribution of @xmath72 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 in ngc 1333 is drawn from a significantly different population from that of taurus @xcite , chamaeleon i @xcite , or the l1688 cloud in ophiuchus @xcite . to do this",

    "ngc 1333 and chamaeleon i have distributions of @xmath72 skewed toward bluer ( smaller ) values .",
    "in chamaeleon i , this is attributed to a spectral type difference between these two regions @xcite .",

    "taurus and ophiuchus both have a median spectral type of m0 .",
    "the median @xmath72 value for m3-m8 objects in ngc 1333 is -1.64 which when compared to the median @xmath72 for k5-m2 objects of -1.50 shows the prevalence of m3-m8 stars in or sample skews the @xmath72 distribution of ngc 1333 to the smaller side .",
