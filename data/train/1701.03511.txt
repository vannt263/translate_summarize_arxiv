    "the four color theorem ( 4ct ) plays a predominant role in the currently fashionable field of graph theory .",
    "the 4ct states that the vertices of every planar graph can be colored with at most four colors in such a way that any two adjacent vertices have different colors @xcite .",
    "a _ coloring _ of a graph is an assignment of colors to its vertices so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color .",
    "the set of all vertices with any one color is independent and is called a _ color class_. an _ @xmath1-coloring _ of a graph @xmath2 uses @xmath1 colors ; it thereby partitions _",
    "@xmath3 _ , the set of vertices into @xmath1 color classes .",
    "heawood @xcite showed that the four color problem becomes true when ` four ' is replaced by ` five ' .",
    "grotzsch @xcite proved that any planar graph without triangle can be colored with three colors and grunbaum @xcite extended the result of grotzsch .    in 1976",
    "appel and haken @xcite achieved a major break through by thoroughly establishing @xmath0 .",
    "their proof is based on studying a large number of cases for which a computer - assisted search for hours is required . in 1997",
    "robertson , sanders , seymour and thomas reproved the @xmath0 with less need for computer verification @xcite . in 2000",
    "ashay dharwadkar gave an algebraic proof to the 4ct involving steiner systems , eilenberg modules , hall matching and reimann surfaces @xcite .",
    "though heawood solved the five color theorem using the principle of mathematical induction , over the past 125 years no one could succeed in employing the same technique in proving the @xmath0 .",
    "also , in the proof of heawood , there is a need to consider different possible colorings of adjacent vertices of a minimum degree vertex of a graph .    in this paper",
    ", we give a simple proof to the @xmath0 .",
    "the proof is based on the principle of mathematical induction , contraction , and possible colorings of a minimum degree vertex , its adjacent vertices , and adjacent vertices of these adjacent vertices .",
    "for all basic ideas in graph theory , we follow @xcite .",

    "our aim is to prove that colorings in which @xmath22 are having colors 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 or colors including 5 are bad colorings of @xmath2 and can be avoided .",

    "at first we consider coloring of the subgraph @xmath33 and from this we try to obtain coloring of @xmath29 . here",

    "<S> their proof is based on studying a large number of cases for which a computer - assisted search for hours is required . in 1997 the 4ct was reproved with less need for computer verification by robertson , sanders , seymour and thomas . in 2000 </S>",
    "<S> ashay dharwadkar gave an algebraic proof to the 4ct involving steiner systems , eilenberg modules , hall matching and riemann surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , we give a simple proof to the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the proof is based on the principle of mathematical induction , contraction , and possible colorings of a minimum degree vertex , its adjacent vertices , and adjacent vertices of these adjacent vertices . </S>"
