    "current numerical calculations of lattice qcd have lattice spacings such that @xmath4 for charm and bottom quarks . to extract meaningful results one must understand how to formulate fermions under these circumstances .",
    "one approach is to formulate this problem starting from the large mass limit .",
    "our approach is to deduce an action that contains the wilson @xcite , static @xcite , and non - relativistic @xcite formulations as special cases .",
    "an important question is how much of the flexibility of our formulation should be exploited to study , for example , quarkonia and heavy - light systems .",
    "a related and practical issue is how one can interpret numerical results obtained with the wilson action when @xmath3 .",
    "this paper offers a brief discussion of these issues .",
    "the key idea is that one should analyze every heavy - quark theory , including the wilson theory , as an effective ( cutoff ) theory .",
    "after all , every numerical simulation has @xmath5 . in other words",
    ", one should avoid being constrained by an implicit desire to take the continuum limit by brute force .",
    "naturally , the goal remains the same , to extract universal ( i.e.  cutoff - free ) information , but one would like to do so as efficiently as possible .    with any effective theory , one must understand its limitations .",
    "it is worth recalling that the characteristic momenta of the systems that we would like to study are much smaller than @xmath1 . in quarkonia",
    "the typical momentum scales are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , so @xmath8 for a wide range of @xmath0 . in heavy - light systems",
    "the typical momentum is roughly @xmath9 , independent of @xmath1 .",
    "below we argue that the wilson action describes heavy quarkonia with the same validity as the non - relativistic effective theory and describes heavy - light systems with the same validity as the non - relativistic and static effective theories .",
    "the familiar heavy - quark effective theories treat time and space asymmetrically",
    ". therefore , it should not be too surprising that our result @xcite boils down to introducing a second hopping parameter to the familiar wilson action .",
