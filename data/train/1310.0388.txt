    "with better sky coverage more and more rare transient events with peak luminosity between those of novae and supernovae ( sne ) are detected ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to them as ilots , for intermediate - luminosity optical transients , although red novae and red transients are also in use .",
    "these rare eruptions can typically last weeks to several years .",
    "the pre - outburst objects of some of the ilots , e.g. , ngc  300 ot2008 - 1 ( ngc  300ot ; @xcite ) , are asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) or extreme - agb stars .",
    "there are single star models ( e.g. , @xcite ) and binary stellar models @xcite for ilot events harboring agb stars .",
    "we consider the binary model ilots , and in the present paper study a specific binary evolutionary channel .    in the binary paradigm ilots",
    "can be powered from merger of a main sequence ( ms ) star ( or slightly evolved off the ms ) with another ms star , as in v838  mon @xcite and v1309  sco @xcite , and from a ms star accreting mass from an evolved star @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that after merger in the formation of a common envelope ( ce ) phase , ilots can be controlled by recombination and powered by the energy released from the recombination of the ejected gas .",
    "for the ilots considered here , that result from merger of a white dwarf ( wd ) and a core , _ wd - core merger _ , the recombination energy is negligible .",
    "ilot can be also powered at the termination of the ce phase by the secondary merging with the core .",
    "@xcite proposed that the ilot ( red transient ) ogle-2002-blg-360 was powered by the collision of a secondary with the core of an evolved star . in some cases",
    "an ilot event can precede a core collapse sn ( ccsn ) event , such as in sn 2010mc @xcite .",
    "sn  2010mc is a type iin ccsn where the ejecta is thought to interact with close circumstellar matter ( csm ) .",
    "@xcite speculated that the pre - explosion outburst ( peo ) was energized by mass accretion onto an o main - sequence stellar secondary .",
    "more generally , some ultraluminous ccsne experience an extreme mass loss episode @xmath3 before explosion ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and a review by @xcite , and references therein ; also , see discussion in @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite suggested that this coincidence can be caused by a secondary that spirals - in inside the envelope and collides with the core . in the scenario of @xcite",
    "the secondary is a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh ) that can accrete mass from the primary and launch jets .",
    "@xcite was considering a ms secondary .    in the present paper",
    "we consider rare cases , termed _ wd - ns reverse evolution _",
    ", where the compact companion to the progenitor of a ccsn is a white dwarf ( wd ) , as opposed to the classical approach of binary systems where the ns is formed first , termed _ ns - wd_. a mass transfer that leads the secondary ( initially less massive ) star to explode as a ccsn and form a wd - ns system with a ns younger than the wd , was mentioned before ( e.g. , @xcite ) , e.g. to explain the presence of a massive wd in the binary radio pulsars psr b2303 + 46 @xcite and psr j1141 - 6545 @xcite . as both systems are in an eccentric orbit the ns - wd evolution is ruled out since it leads to a circularized orbit .",
    "while these previous works focus mainly on an outcome of a binary containing a wd and a ns , our present work emphasizes other outcomes of the reverse evolution , in particular wd - core merger and the possibility of an ilot event .",
    "we also note that @xcite considered a mass transfer process in more massive binary systems that leads to a reversal of the end states , resulting in a ns that forms before a black hole .",
    "in section [ sec : evolution ] we list the evolutionary routes of the wd - ns reverse evolution considered in the present study and also estimate the galactic birthrate of such systems ( section [ sec : br ] ) . in section [ sec : ce ]",
    "we discuss the possible outcomes of the ce evolution . in section [ sec : postce ] we discuss the observational consequences of some of the outcomes .",

    "we examine the evolution of two massive stars in a binary system with a total mass of @xmath4 as schematically presented in figs . [",
    "fig : mech1 ] and [ fig : mech2 ] .",
    "each one of the original stars by itself will end up in a white dwarf ( wd ) , but due to mass transfer the secondary might become massive enough to be considered a progenitor of a ccsn . the binary evolution might be accompanied by an ilot event . as seen in these figures",
    "we consider many evolutionary routes where a wd is formed before either a ns , which we term wd - ns reverse evolution , or a massive core that is a potential progenitor of a ns ; we will refer in short to the second case as wd - ns reverse evolution as well .",
    "several papers other than those listed in section [ sec : introduction ] include charts of ce evolution and ns formation that show the rich variety of evolutionary routes involving a ce phase , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; another chart with more examples and a thorough review of the ce evolution can be found in .",
    "however , these papers did not emphasize the wd - ns reverse evolution accompanied by a possible merger event , and did not consider the possibility of an ilot event in a short or extended time before the sn explosion .",
    "we calculate stellar evolution for non - rotating stars with solar metallicity ( z=0.02 ) from the zams , with initial mass of @xmath5 for the original stars and @xmath6 for the post - mass transfer secondary star . in all calculations",
    "we use the modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ) , version 4798 ( @xcite ) . for a primary of mass @xmath0 , where @xmath7 is the initial mass of the primary star , two rapid rises in the radius",
    "are expected , one when the core is mainly made out of helium and the second when the star has a co core .",
    "these two expansion phases are presented for a @xmath8 stellar model in fig .",
    "[ fig:7ms ] . despite the limited temporal resolution of the evolution presented on the hr diagram",
    ", it is very similar to that presented by @xcite for their @xmath8 star .",
    "we study binary systems where the orbital separation is such that a roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) occurs either when the primary star has a he core , or during its second expansion phase when it has a massive co core . in the earlier case",
    "the primary transfers its h - rich envelope , shrinks , mass transfer ceases , and the he core continues to evolve to form a co wd .",
    "here we do not treat the mass transfer phase , but only assume an ad - hoc mass transfer rate allowing the accreting star to dynamically re - adjust , hence preventing a common envelope ( ce ) during the mass transfer phase @xcite .",
    "the rlof commences before a significant amount of mass is removed from the primary by its wind . at most about several @xmath9 of mass is carried by the primary wind and possible jets from the accreting secondary star .",
    "moreover , we also consider only massive secondary stars , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the initial mass of the secondary star , such that the secondary ( a ) can accrete at a high rate , several @xmath12 within @xmath13 , from the mass - losing primary star , and ( b ) brings the primary envelope to synchronization and a ce is avoided at this stage .",
    "this mass limit of @xmath14 is very similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "after mass transfer ends the secondary has a mass of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mass of the post - accretion secondary star , so that it can be considered as a ccsn progenitor ( @xcite ) .",
    "we make the same assumptions as in the population synthesis of @xcite . in particular",
    "that ( a ) @xmath17 of the mass lost by the primary is accreted by the secondary , and that ( b ) the secondary is massive enough , @xmath18 , to bring the primary envelope to synchronization and prevent a ce phase during the first mass transfer episode ( from the primary to the secondary ) .",
    "this is similar to the treatment of @xcite .",
    "we note the following regarding these assumptions : ( 1 ) an accretion fraction of @xmath17 can be achieved for example if the mass is lost mainly by jets blown by the accreting companion , then a mass loss fraction of @xmath19 is typical .",
    "another way to get @xmath20 is that the mass transfer is conservative in the rlof until the primary loses its h - rich envelope and shrinks to form a he star , and then loses the rest of the envelope in a wind @xcite . ( 2 ) such jets and radiation from the accretion disk remove most of the accreted energy , such that the secondary can accrete lots of mass within a relatively short time without expanding much , e.g. , as the secondary in the great eruption of @xmath21 carinae @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) after the mass of the secondary becomes larger than the primary mass , mass transfer increases the orbital separation , helping in avoiding the ce phase .",
    "these assumptions are in dispute , but bring the number of type ia progenitors to a much better agreement with observations @xcite . in the calculations of stellar evolution we use conservative mass transfer ( @xmath22 ) in the discussions , just for convenience .    , is a co white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "the different evolutionary routes for a co wd are numbered in the bottom line .",
    "we study systems where the primary experiences a roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) when it reaches either the rgb or agb phase ( 2@xmath23 stage in the figure ) .",
    "if the primary experiences rlof before it develops a co core as a giant , an intermediate stage will take place ( before the 3@xmath24 stage ) : the giant primary loses its h - rich envelope , shrinks , and the he core continues to evolve and form a co core after the rlof ceased .",
    "we consider only systems where even if mass transfer starts when the primary is on the rgb sufficient envelope is left for it to form a co wd .",
    "the mass transfer brings the secondary mass to @xmath15 , and leaves a wd remnant from the primary star . as the secondary star ( gray ) evolves to a red supergiant ( rsg ) , tidal forces",
    "cause the wd to lose angular momentum and spiral - in towards the core of the secondary rsg ( 4@xmath25 stage ) .",
    "the ce can terminate in one of three routes .",
    "( a ) the wd merges with the core before the entire envelope is ejected .",
    "any explosion that occurs in one of the cases indicated will lead to a type ii sn . in some of the cases the explosion will lead to a usual ccsn process , and in others a thermonuclear explosion will lead to a peculiar type ii sn .",
    "( b ) the entire envelope is lost and the wd ends outside the core of the rsg .",
    "this route will lead to either a type ia supernova ( sn ia ) + core collapse sn ( ccsn ) , or a wd + ccsn",
    ". both ccsn will be either type ib or ic ( type ibc in short ) .",
    "( c ) the entire envelope is ejected and the system suffers a dynamical instability , e.g. , darwin instability , such that a wd - core merger occurs .",
    "a second ce phase commences .",
    "this liberates huge amounts of gravitational energy that can manifest as an intermediate luminosity optical transient ( ilot ) .",

    "the post - accretion secondary star expands to a radius comparable to the maximum radius attained by the original primary star , but now the orbital angular momentum is too low to bring the secondary envelope to synchronization and a ce is inevitable . as seen in figures [ fig : ev_10 ] and [ fig : ev_12 ] , the post - accretion secondary has two possible expansions , the first when it obtained a he core ( or heco core for the @xmath34 star ) , and the other when there is an inner co core surrounded by a he shell ( which we refer to as a co core ) .",

    "taking into account the mass accretion fraction , @xmath17 , for any initial mass of the primary the post accretion secondary must satisfy @xmath30 in order to be considered a ccsn progenitor .",
    "since we take the lower boundary on the initial mass of the companion to be @xmath49 any primary star with a mass within the range @xmath50 would allow the mass of the post accretion companion to be @xmath45 .",
    "namely , the minimum allowed mass for the secondary is @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "for the lower mass range of primary stars @xmath53 the minimum allowed initial secondary mass has to satisfy @xmath54 so that @xmath45 holds .",
    "consequently we divide the integration in equation ( [ eq : pr1 ] ) to two parts @xmath55    @xmath56    in the work of @xcite the different evolutionary outcomes for a close binary system are presented ( fig . 20 ) as regions in the plane of initial orbital separation @xmath57 ( initial semimajor axis for a circular orbit ) vs. @xmath7 ( initial primary mass ) . in their calculations , for the primary to have a co core the orbital separation range for our primary stellar mass range is between 1 ( for the lower mass primaries ) and 0.8 ( higher mass ) in log scale .",
    "so the relevant orbital separation range is @xmath31 in a log scale .",
    "we note though that when eccentricity is considered , even systems with an initial orbital separation of @xmath58 can go through the suggested evolutionary routes when the primary suffers a rlof after developing a co core .",
    "as well , we can consider an earlier rlof when the primary has a he core , as later the he core evolves to form a co wd ( similar to @xcite ) . over all we take the orbital separation relevant for the considered evolution to be 1 dex .",

    "we considered the wd - ns binary outcomes , as well as merger , the possibility of an ilot event , and a variety of peculiarities .    in the studied scenarios the more massive star evolves first to a wd , but",
    "the secondary star is in an orbital distance that facilitates a roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) during the agb phase of the primary star or at an earlier stage when the primary has a he core . in the later case",
    "the post - transfer primary shrinks , mass transfer ceases , and the he core evolves to form a co ( or onemg ) wd ( similar to @xcite ) . in the majority of cases the wd descendant of the primary star is a carbon - oxygen ( co ) wd , but when the initial mass of the primary is in the range @xmath128 the remnant might be an onemg wd .",

    "furthermore , the synchronized system is practically stable against darwin instability ( eq .",

    "occurs with no envelope , but possibly with an optically - thick wind ( the ejected envelope ) .",
    "if merger occurs much later , then there will be no hydrogen in the vicinity .",
    "the merger itself releases gravitational energy much larger than the binding energy of the envelope , as given in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "even if only a small fraction of this energy is radiated , the process will form a bright event lasting days to months .",
    "in addition , the ejected gas from the merger process will collide with previously ejected envelope , and kinetic energy will be channelled to radiation ( see section [ sec : postce ] ) .",
    "such an event might be classified as an intermediate luminosity optical transient ( ilot ; red nova ; red transient ) .",

    "only the case with an aic of an onemg wd a ccsne type explosion might occur shortly after an ilot event . if an explosion occurs only few days after an ilot event , it might be that the two events will be observed as one explosion .",
    "our main results are that the type of binary systems studied here can lead to a rich variety of peculiar explosions , most of which will be preceded by an ilot event , and be accompanied by narrow lines of hydrogen from the previously ejected hydrogen rich envelope .",

    "this is peculiar in the sense that the collapse occurs before the rest of the core had evolved as in regular ccsne ( one-1 ) . in cases where this happens after complete ejection of the h - rich envelope",
    ", this route will end in a peculiar ccsn type ibc ( route one-6 ) .",
