    "the ads / cft correspondence is a principle that connects a strongly coupled @xmath2-dimensional conformal field theory with a weakly coupled @xmath3-dimensional gravity theory @xcite .",
    "this principle , also known as the gauge / gravity duality , is well - founded in string theory , and has been applied to many field theories having gravity duals with the most noticeable application in condensed matter physics .",
    "one of the earliest applications of the gauge / gravity duality to condensed matter systems was the holographic description of a superconductor @xcite .",
    "it is described by an einstein - maxwell - scalar field theory in which the breaking of a gauge symmetry in the gravity sector corresponds , in the boundary theory , to an operator ( the order parameter ) which condenses below a critical temperature signaling the onset of superconductivity .",
    "the gauge / gravity duality has also been used as a framework for fermi liquid behavior @xcite , non - linear hydrodynamics @xcite , quantum phase transitions @xcite and transport @xcite .",
    "thus , classical gravity theories have been transformed into a laboratory for exploring condensed matter physics from a different point of view @xcite . in this way",
    "the holographic principle is a powerful tool for studying strongly - correlated systems .",
    "recently , there has been considerable activity using the holographic principle to describe metallic states of matter outside of landau s fermi liquid theory @xcite .",
    "experiments provide evidence for the existence of materials whose electronic structure can not be described by fermi liquid theory , nor by any other known effective theory . while fermi liquids are characterized by stable quasi - particles , these exotic materials possess well - defined fermi surfaces but lack long - lived quasi - particles . a quantitative discussion of signatures of different excitations is presented in detail below .",
    "to describe such metallic systems , one needs to introduce charged fermions in the gravity sector of the holographic system .",
    "however , in general , fermions can not be treated classically as in the case of charged scalar fields of holographic superfluids or superconductors .",
    "the coupled system of einstein - maxwell - dirac field equations become tractable only in the limit in which the fermions may be treated locally in the bulk as a charged ideal fluid of zero temperature .",
    "the solutions of these systems are known as an electron star @xcite , dirac hair @xcite or confined fermi liquid @xcite .    in another approach to describe the various phases of a metallic state at low temperatures , a dipole coupling for massless charged fermions is introduced @xcite .",
    "the modified dirac equation in the background of an ads - reissner - nordstrm black hole produces a boundary fermionic spectrum with vanishing spectral weight for a range of energies around @xmath4 without the breaking of any symmetry . as the dipole coupling strength",
    "is varied , the fluid has fermi , marginal fermi , non - fermi liquid phases and also an additional insulating phase .",
    "the insulating phase possesses the characteristics representative of mott insulators , namely the dynamic formation of a gap and spectral weight transfer .",
    "similar behavior was found in other constructions @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the fermi surface and selection of ( non- ) fermi liquid type are discussed in @xcite .    for a fermi liquid ,",
    "the characteristic signature of a quasi - particle is a pole in the retarded green function @xmath5 .",
    "the location of the pole g_r^-1 ( = 0 , k = k_f ) = 0  , in momentum space at zero frequency dictates the fermi surface and dispersion .",
    "additionally , the real component of the green function , @xmath6 , must change signs . in a normal , weakly - coupled metal , this is only possible through the pole , and via luttinger s theorem , integrating over the positive region of @xmath5 one obtains the particle density @xcite .",
    "apart from fermi liquids , one of the principal examples of a strongly correlated condensed matter system is the mott insulator , parent state of high - temperature copper - oxide superconductors in which a gap is dynamically generated .",
    "an explanation for the insulating nature @xcite is that a mott gap manifests as a surface of zeroes in the green function .",
    "the green function of interest , @xmath5 , may be expressed in terms of the non - interacting theory green function , @xmath7 , and the self - energy @xmath8 , [ gpole ] g_r^-1 ( , k ) = g_0 ^ -1 ( , k ) + ( , k )  , of which a zero is indicative of a divergent self - energy .",
    "it is the divergent self - energy that restricts the band from crossing the fermi energy leading to mottness .",
    "the full condition for mottness is specifically on the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath5 and represented with the determinant as , [ mottness ] g_r(=0,k = k_l ) = 0  . for our purposes , we are interested in the spinor space but the statement may be extended to multiple bands @xcite .",
    "a mean - field theory approach such as conventional bcs theory as calculated with the nambu propagator , is unable to produce such a result .",
    "the location of poles and zeroes in @xmath5 provides a path to uncover a system s behavior .",
    "the interplay between poles and zeros is a characteristic feature of qcd .",
    "the renormalization from high ( uv ) to low ( ir ) energy of couplings and masses in qcd involves free quarks at uv scales , which exhibit poles in the propagator , while at ir scales the poles are converted to zeros @xcite signaling the formation of bound states .",
    "the zero of the single quark propagator in the ir is due to an orthogonal configuration between the ( uv ) single quark description and the composite mesons in the ir .    in condensed matter physics the competition of poles ( @xmath9 ) and zeroes ( @xmath10 ) in the green function provides an illuminating criterion for characterizing the different phases found in strongly - coupled fermion systems @xcite .",
    "exploring the hubbard model in this context has led to a variety of features present in doped mott insulators , including spectral weight transfer , fermi arcs found in the pseudo - gap state , and fermi pockets @xcite .",
    "the fermi arcs may be seen as a general consequence of a composite state of uv fields , and hence zeroes , existing at low energies within the hubbard model @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a `` pole - zero mechanism '' for the two - dimensional hubbard model was used to characterize the transition from metal to mott insulator in terms of interfering pole and zero surfaces .",
    "the formalism is comprehensive enough to accommodate arcs , hole pockets , in - gap states , lifshitz transitions and non - fermi liquids .",
    "the work was furthered in @xcite to address several anomalies in connection to ( non ) d - wave symmetries seen in the pseudo - gap and to suggest a topological quantum phase transition responsible for a non - fermi liquid phase .    a holographic description of the structure of poles and zeros and their interconnection addresses central issues in strongly - coupled fermionic systems .",
    "a fermi surface in the green function for holographic fermions was discovered in @xcite with the discussion further expanded in @xcite . near the fermi surface , the structure of the poles is expanded similarly to eq .   as [ hgreen ] g_r^-1 ( , k ) ~k - k_f -/v_f - ( , k ) with self - energy @xmath11 @xcite given as [ eqnupmt ] ( , k ) ~c ^2_k^  ,  6 _ k^2 = k^2 -  , with fermion charge @xmath12 and numerically calculated constant @xmath13 .",
    "it is this scaling dimension @xmath14 that selects the leading term in ( [ hgreen ] ) dictating the dispersion relation at the fermi surface , and hence the type of fluid . for scaling dimension @xmath15 ,",
    "the pole of @xmath5 corresponds to an unstable quasi - particle .",
    "this is identified as a non - fermi fluid . with the value @xmath16",
    ", the excitations are of marginal fermi fluid type .",
    "for @xmath17 the dispersion relation is linear .",
    "this is the fermi ( non - landau ) fluid .",
    "lastly , imaginary @xmath14 corresponds to `` log oscillatory '' solutions .    since the discovery of fermi surfaces within the strongly coupled field theories analyzed via holography",
    ", an exploration of fermions has taken place .",
    "mechanisms underlying different p - wave @xcite and d - wave @xcite symmetries for spectral functions have been offered .",
    "an effective lattice was added in @xcite by using a modulated chemical potential .",
    "the spatial dependence alters the energy scaling and offers identifying signs for a holographic realization of a pseudo - gap state .",
    "more fundamental ( top - down ) holographic theories from truncations of string / m - theory have produced viable models describing superfluity and superconductivity @xcite . in higher dimensions ,",
    "fermions are typically coupled to gravity and gauge fields with high - order derivatives .",
    "there are consistent truncations to lower dimensions in the fermionic sector giving interesting fermionic couplings @xcite .",
    "dipole ( pauli ) couplings are found to be a common feature of the theories with the coupling constant realized as scalar - dependent @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to explore their effect on fermion spectral functions at the boundary .    in this work ,",
    "we aim at studying the zeroes and poles of the green function @xmath5 in a holographic system with a gravity sector consisting of an ads - reissner - nordstrm black hole and a dipole coupling of massless charged fermions to an electromagnetic field . by exploring a duality between the zeroes and poles of this holographic system",
    "we show that by varying the dipole coupling strength , @xmath5 may possess only poles , only zeroes , or both poles and zeroes .",
    "this behavior suggests that the dipole coupling strength plays the role of an order parameter in the mott physics . by studying a simple model in which a fermion is coupled to a gauge field through a dipole interaction in the bulk",
    ", we find that on the field theory side as the strength of this interaction is varied , a new band in the density of states emerges and spectral density is transferred between bands . in the language of green functions",
    "only poles is the signature of the fermi and non - fermi liquids , only zeroes corresponds to the mott insulating phase , and the coexistence of both poles and zeroes is the pseudo - gap phase .",
    "this duality between zeroes and poles also suggests that within the holographic system , the properties of the green function @xmath5 signifying the mott phase can be inferred by mapping to the well understood green function of a fermi liquid by simply changing the sign of the dipole coupling constant @xmath18 .",
    "the discussion is organized as follows . in section ( [ sect2 ] ) we set up the theory and derive the einstein - maxwell - dirac equations . in section ( [ sect3 ] )",
    "we solve the dirac equation . in section ( [ sect4 ] )",

    "as we discussed in the introduction , the interplay between the state of matter and the appearance of poles and zeroes is also observed in qcd .",
    "the difference with qcd is that the appearance of free quarks or bound states depends on the dynamics of the strong gauge theory while in our case there is a variation of a simple coupling that gives the various phases of matter",
    ". it would be intriguing to find other dynamical systems exhibiting this behavior .",
    "one may wonder if this analysis can be applied to holographic superconductors . in bcs superconductivity",
    "the role of the order parameter is played by the condensate of a scalar field .",
    "the formation of a condensate corresponds to a critical temperature below which the system enters the superconductivity phase . in this phase",
    ", the electrons are combined to form cooper pairs which are electronic bound states and therefore correspond to zeroes . on the contrary",
    ", the electrons in the normal phase are free corresponding to poles .    in spite of the similarities with superconductivity ,",
    "our analysis does not explicitly break a gauge symmetry that could have defined an order parameter for the various phases .",
    "instead the metallic phases are controlled by an explicit coupling of charged fermions to a gauge field .",
    "nevertheless , it will be enlightening to consider how a bulk scalar responsible for superconductivity or the coupling will influence the system . also worth exploring",
    "is if a description with additional fields could explain the green function zeroes in terms of a composite excitation .",
    "another way to better understand our results is to calculate the holographic entanglement entropy in our theory .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xcite has proven to be a powerful tool in counting the degrees of freedom available in a holographic system .",
    "in @xcite it was found that the holographic entanglement entropy of a superconducting phase is less than that of the normal phase due to the formation of cooper pairs reducing the degrees of freedom available ( see also @xcite ) . near the contact interface ,",
    "the normal phase entanglement entropy possesses a higher value compared to the superconducting phase due to the proximity effect : the leakage of cooper pairs to the normal phase so more free electrons were available .",
    "similarly we expect that the entanglement entropy in a holographic fermionic system with a dipole coupling will vary , as the degrees of freedom change from the fermi liquid phase to the mott insulating phase providing important information on the various phases of the system .",
    "however , such a study has to overcome the basic difficulty of working with a probe fermonic system .",
    "the boundary theory will see the effect of the dipole coupling only with a fully back - reacted solution .",
    "once a full solution is obtained the dipole coupling could leave some trace on the metric .",
