    "in diffuse interstellar clouds ( @xmath4 ) the gas is heated mainly by photoelectrons expelled from dust grains by far ",
    "ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons @xcite in the energy range 6ev@xmath513.6ev .",
    "the high energy limit corresponds to the cut  off in the fuv radiation field caused by the hydrogen absorption ( @xmath6=13.6ev ) , while the low energy limit corresponds to the energy needed to free electrons from the grains ( @xmath76ev ) . in the cold neutral medium ( @xmath8k )",
    "photoelectric heating accounts for most of the heating , the x - ray and cosmic ray heating rates being more than an order of magnitude smaller @xcite . in a relatively dense neutral medium ( @xmath9100@xmath10 ) ,",
    "where a significant fraction of carbon is in the neutral form , carbon ionization becomes an important heating source , but it is still not comparable to the photoelectric effect .",
    "the efficiency of the photoelectric heating , @xmath1 , is defined as the ratio between the kinetic energy of photoelectrons available to heat the gas and the fuv energy absorbed by the grains . @xcite",
    "estimated the photoelectric yield to be close to 10% , meaning that of all the photons absorbed by grains only one in ten ionizes them .",
    "furthermore , since the average absorbed photon has an energy of @xmath118ev and the work function for a neutral grain is @xmath115.5ev , only one third of the absorbed energy goes into the kinetic energy of the electron . the overall efficiency is therefore expected to be close to 3% , at least in the cold neutral medium .",
    "the rate decreases as the grains become positively charged . in the intense fuv radiation field of photodissociation regions , for example",
    ", the efficiency can be more than a factor of ten lower than in the cold neutral medium .",
    "@xcite have recently studied a sample of translucent , high latitude clouds ( hlcs ) .",
    "the [ c@xmath12 158@xmath13 m line @xmath14 was observed with iso and this was correlated with fir intensities . in the cold neutral medium",
    "the [ cii ] line dominates the cooling @xcite , neutral carbon being the next most important coolant .",
    "@xcite estimated that for these clouds the ci cooling rate is at most 30% of the [ cii ] cooling rate and the co rate is more than one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "therefore , for the observed hlcs the [ c@xmath12 158@xmath13 m line should account for at least 60% of the cooling and in most lines of sight the percentage should be considerably higher .    to be a tracer of photoelectric heating the [ cii ] emission",
    "must originate from the same regions where the photoelectric effect is the main heating source and , conversely , all regions where the photoelectric heating is dominant must be cooled predominantly by the [ cii ] emission . as discussed by ingalls et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , both conditions are approximately satisfied .",
    "the ionization potential of carbon , 11.3ev , is above the work function of grains , and therefore c@xmath15 exists only in regions where photoelectric heating is possible .",
    "conversely , in regions where c@xmath15 is not present and c and co are significant coolants , the photoelectric heating rate must be much lower than in regions where c@xmath15 is present .",
    "as in ingalls et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we therefore assume that the above conditions are satisfied and the photoelectric heating is exactly balanced by the [ cii ] line cooling .",
    "since all the fuv radiation in the energy range 6ev@xmath513.6ev absorbed by grains contributes to the photoelectric heating , the efficiency @xmath1 of this heating mechanism can be computed as the ratio of the observed [ cii ] line emission and the absorbed fuv radiation .",
    "if dust properties are assumed to be known , the absorbed fuv radiation can be estimated through the observed fir emission .",
    "the problem of estimating @xmath1 is therefore reduced to the problem of computing the correlation between the absorbed fuv radiation and the observable fir emission .",
    "such correlation depends on both the intensity of the radiation field and the column density and can be determined with model calculations .",
    "the degeneracy between the effect of the column density and of the intensity of the the external radiation field could in principle be broken using the information contained in the shape of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "this requires , however , quite precise modeling of the dust emission .",
    "@xcite modeled their observations using a plane parallel geometry .",
    "the fir emission was calculated with a dust model consisting only of grains at equilibrium temperature . a comparison with [ cii ] and fir observations resulted in an estimate of @xmath16 for the efficiency of the photoelectric heating . the average radiation field , @xmath17 ,",
    "was estimated to be above the local interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 refers to the sum of the 2.7k cosmic background and the spectrum given by @xcite and @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we follow the same approach as in ingalls et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , in the sense of deriving theoretical relations between the fuv absorption and the fir emission and then using the empirical relation between [ cii ] and fir intensities to estimate the average efficiency of the photoelectric heating .",
    "however , our models of the fuv absorption and fir emission is significantly more detailed and realistic than in ingalls et al . (",
    "we compute the radiative transfer on cloud models based on three dimensional numerical simulations of compressible magneto  hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the density distribution of these turbulent flows provides a realistic model for the density inhomogeneity of interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "the penetration of fuv radiation into the cloud depends on the cloud structure .",
    "inside an inhomogeneous cloud the intensity of short wavelength radiation is higher than inside a homogenous cloud .",
    "furthermore , density variations generate a significant scatter in the relation between the local fuv absorption and fir emission . our model can therefore be used to estimate what fraction of the observed scatter can be attributed to the inhomogeneous nature of the density field .",
    "other factors that could also contribute to the observed scatter , such as anisotropy in the radiation field or abundance variations , are not considered .",
    "other improvements of our work , compared with ingalls et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , are related to the employed dust model .",
    "we use the three component model of @xcite .",
    "the fir intensities are calculated using the method of @xcite and the emission from transiently heated dust grains is included .",
    "the density distributions of the models are the result of three dimensional simulations of super  alfvnic , compressible , magneto  hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence .",
    "three models are used , from three simulations with different values of the rms sonic mach number of the flow , @xmath20 , 2.5 and 10.0 in model @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the simulations are carried out on a staggered grid of 250@xmath24 computational cells , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "turbulence is set up as an initial large scale random and solenoidal velocity field ( generated in fourier space with power only in the range of wavenumbers @xmath25 ) and maintained with an external large scale random and solenoidal force , correlated at the largest scale turn  over time .",
    "the initial density and magnetic field are uniform and the gas is assumed to be isothermal .",
    "details about the numerical method are given in padoan & nordlund ( 1999 ) .",
    "experiments are run for approximately 10 dynamical times in order to achieve a statistically relaxed state .",
    "the cloud models used in this work correspond to the final snapshot of each simulation . the value of @xmath26 is varied in different experiments by varying the thermal energy .",
    "the initial rms alfvnic mach number remains unchanged , @xmath27 , from run to run .",
    "the volume  averaged magnetic field strength is constant in time because of the imposed flux conservation .",
    "the magnetic energy is instead amplified .",
    "the initial value of the ratio of average magnetic and dynamic pressures is @xmath28 for all runs , so all the runs are initially super  alfvnic .",
    "the value of the same ratio at later times is larger , due to the magnetic energy amplification , but still significantly lower than unity ( 0.21 , 0.14 and 0.12 for models @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively ) .",
    "the turbulence is therefore super  alfvnic at all times .",
    "supersonic and super  alfvnic turbulence of an isothermal gas generates a highly inhomogeneous gas density distribution , with a density contrast of several orders of magnitude .",
    "it has been shown to provide a good description of the dynamics of molecular clouds and of their highly fragmented nature @xcite .",
    "translucent high latitude clouds ( hlcs ) , such as the ones observed by @xcite , have been studied thanks to their co emission @xcite . despite their lower gas density and presumably larger fraction of gas in the atomic form",
    ", the clouds can still be approximately modeled with an isothermal equation of state . at densities above 1@xmath10",
    "the gas temperature is expected to remain mostly in the range 50100k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the observed clouds are characterized by supersonic turbulent motions like denser molecular clouds ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it seems therefore appropriate to use supersonic turbulence as a model not only of dense molecular clouds , but also of more diffuse clouds , such as the ones studied in this work",
    ". a subsonic model ( model @xmath21 ) is also used in this work for the purpose of studying the effect of varying @xmath26 over a large range of values . to compute the radiative transfer",
    "the data cubes of the density distributions are scaled to physical units by fixing the length of the computational grid , @xmath29  pc , and the average hydrogen density , @xmath30  @xmath10 .",
    "however , the radiative transfer calculations apply to all values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfying the condition that their product is constant , @xmath33  pc  @xmath10= @xmath34  @xmath35 .",
    "the column density in the models varies between different lines of sight , because of the inhomogeneous density field .",
    "variations are particularly large in model @xmath23 , where the range of column density values is comparable to that found in the @xcite sample .",
    "this can be seen for example by comparing the fir intensities in the models and in the observations ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : results ] ) . when results are compared with observations , the angular size of the models ( or their distance ) must be fixed as well , in order to take into account the spatial resolution of the observations .",
    "one cell , 6.0/250  pc , is assumed to correspond to 0.25@xmath36 , setting the model clouds at the distance of 330  pc .",
    "radiative transfer calculations are needed to obtain estimates for the [ cii ] emission and the total fir emission along different lines of sight through the model clouds .",
    "calculations are carried out on the original grid of 250@xmath37 cells .",
    "the external radiation field is assumed to be the local interstellar radiation field near the sun @xcite .",
    "the dust model is taken from @xcite .",
    "this includes silicate grains ( sizes @xmath38   ) , graphite grains ( @xmath39   ) and pahs ( from @xmath40   to @xmath41   ) with ionization state corresponding to physical conditions in the cold neutral medium ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "following @xcite we assume explicitly a balance between the cooling by [ cii ] line emission and the photoelectric heating .",
    "the latter is taken to be equal to the dust absorption in the energy range 613.6ev multiplied by the efficiency of the photoelectric emission , @xmath1 .",
    "the penetration of the external radiation field is simulated with monte carlo methods , and the absorption in the given energy range is stored in each cell .",
    "the emerging [ cii ] intensity is calculated by summing the corresponding emission on selected lines  of  sight , assuming the emission is optically thin .",
    "the efficiency of the photoelectric heating is unknown but since it is assumed to be constant troughout the cloud it can be taken into account later in the analysis .",
    "the dust emission was calculated using the ` library method ' discussed in @xcite .",
    "first a mapping between the strength of the local radiation field at a few reference frequencies and the resulting dust emission is established .",
    "the radiation field at the reference frequencies is then simulated and the emission is obtained using the existing mapping . the emission , including the contribution from transiently heated particles , can be estimated with an accuracy of a few per cent even in the case of large three  dimensional models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the infrared emission from the clouds is estimated using this method .",
    "ingalls et al . ( 2002 ) calculated fir emission based on 60@xmath13 m and 100@xmath13 m values using the formula @xmath42 the formula gives the fir emission between 42.5@xmath13 m and 122.5@xmath13 m i.e. the wavelength range covered by the iras 60@xmath13 m and 100@xmath13 m filters @xcite . in our models the formula was found to be accurate to @xmath43 per cent . however , the quoted fir intensities are here calculated by direct integration over the computed spectra .",
    "both the fuv absorption ( equivalent to the [ cii ] emission divided by the efficiency , @xmath44 ) and the fir intensity , @xmath45 , are calculated towards three directions perpendicular to the faces of the cubic cloud . for each direction ,",
    "maps of 250@xmath46250 positions are generated .",
    "results are compared with observations presented by @xcite .",
    "the iso lws observations of the [ c@xmath12 158@xmath13 m line have a resolution of 71@xmath47 .",
    "the fir data are based on iras issa maps with a resolution of @xmath48 .",
    "we assume the cells of our models have an angular size of 0.25@xmath36 , and the computed [ cii ] and fir maps are convolved to the resolution of the observations .",
    "for each model the fuv absorption and the fir intensity , @xmath45 are calculated towards three directions perpendicular to the faces of the density field data cubes . since the fuv absorption is assumed to be equivalent to the [ cii ] line intensity , @xmath49 , divided by the efficiency , @xmath1 , in the following we will refer to the quantity @xmath44 ( with @xmath1 still unknown ) , instead of the computed fuv absorption .",
    "[ fig : map.y ] shows the distribution of the ratio @xmath50 in the three models .",
    "the figure is obtained at the original resolution ( 250@xmath46250 pixels ) , and neither @xmath45 nor @xmath44 are spatially convolved .",
    "model @xmath21 is based on a flow with subsonic turbulence , with only small density fluctuations .",
    "this is reflected in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : map.y ] showing a smooth distribution of @xmath51 in model @xmath21 . the density contrast increases with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "model @xmath22 , with @xmath52 , shows a more ` clumpy ' distribution of @xmath51 ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : map.y ] ) .",
    "model @xmath23 , with @xmath53 , has clearly the most inhomogeneous and filamentary distribution ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : map.y ] ) .    in the case of the nearly homogeneous cloud @xmath21 ,",
    "both @xmath45 and @xmath44 are determined mainly by the distance to the cloud surface .",
    "since @xmath44 is assumed to be equivalent to the fuv absorption , @xmath44 depends only on photons in the energy range 613.6  ev , while @xmath45 depends on a much wider wavelength range responsible for heating the dust grains .",
    "the dust extinction increases towards shorter wavelengths , and this leads to a reduction in the ratio @xmath51 inside the clouds . at the cloud surface the ratio @xmath51 is above one , and it decreases to @xmath540.8 inside the cloud , in all three models . the total range of values is wider in the more inhomogeneous clouds , with the lowest values reached in the highest density peaks .",
    "the average ratios are , however , very similar in all three models , @xmath550.9 .",
    "the average value depends , of course , on the total column density and it would become lower in more opaque clouds .",
    "the models have similar column densities as the clouds in the sample of @xcite , and if the clouds are subjected to similar radiation field as the models the exact correspondence can be checked by comparing the fir intensities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : av.y ] we plot the ratio @xmath51 against the visual extinction of the corresponding line of sight .",
    "the average optical depth of the model clouds is below one , but the total range of @xmath56 values depends on the degree of inhomogeneity . while in model @xmath21 the visual extinction stays below @xmath111@xmath57 , the other models include a number of lines of sight with @xmath58 in excess of 2@xmath57 ( model @xmath22 ) and 3@xmath57 ( model @xmath23 ) .",
    "the figure shows the results for both unconvolved data and for the case where data have been convolved to the resolution of the observations ( 71@xmath47 for [ cii ] and @xmath114@xmath36 for fir data ) .",
    "the @xmath58 data has not been convolved .",
    "this would correspond to a situation where the extinction is derived from photometry of an individual background star , probing only a single line of sight inside the larger beam employed in the other observations .",
    "the negative correlation between extinction and the ratio @xmath50 is clearly visible in model @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : av.y]a ) . in model",
    "@xmath22 the correlation can be seen in the unconvolved data , while in the convolved data the large difference between the resolution of the [ cii ] and fir observations increases the scatter and the correlation becomes weak . at high extinction values",
    "the convolution increases systematically the @xmath51 values .",
    "the [ cii ] intensity depends on fuv absorption , and because of the high optical depth the [ cii ] emission is likely to saturate near the column density maxima .",
    "since the intensity distribution is already flat the convolution has little effect on the peak [ cii ] intensities .",
    "the fir emission is less saturated and , more importantly , the fir intensities are convolved with a beam that is several times larger .",
    "as the the fir peaks are smoothed away the ratio @xmath50 increases .",
    "the effect is even higher in model @xmath23 because of the stronger density contrast .",
    "however , in model @xmath23 the @xmath58dependence is quite weak even in the unconvolved data .",
    "this can be attributed to other effects related to the increased density contrast .",
    "for example , dense filaments and sheets are common , with the result that the @xmath58 along one line of sight can be much higher than the average extinction by which the material is shielded towards other directions . in the figure",
    "this results in a larger scatter along the @xmath58 axis .    in a homogeneous model",
    "the extinction of the external radiation field proceeds in a predictable fashion , and the ratio between optical and fuv intensities only depends on the distance from the cloud surface . in an inhomogeneous cloud",
    "there is no longer a one  to ",
    "one relation between the shape of the spectral energy distribution and the intensity of the radiation .",
    "the fuv radiation penetrates deeper into the cloud than in the homogeneous model , and the variation in the ratio between optical and fuv intensities becomes smaller .",
    "if the cloud consisted of optically very thick clumps , the incoming radiation would have exactly the same spectral energy distribution at the centre of the cloud as on the surface  only the intensity would be smaller .",
    "mhd models are somewhere between the two extremes , that is between a homogeneous cloud and a cloud with optically thick clumps . in different parts of the cloud",
    "the spectrum of the radiation field may be different even for the same ` effective extinction ' and this increases the scatter along the @xmath59axis .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : av2.y ] the dependence on the visual extinction along the line of sight is shown separately for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this shows explicitly the saturation of the [ cii ] emission , which at high column densities is caused by the total absorption of incoming fuv intensity .",
    "the [ cii ] line itself is assumed to be optically thin .",
    "the effect is particularly clear in model @xmath22 .",
    "it is present also in model @xmath23 , but it is partially masked by the scatter resulting from the more inhomogeneous cloud structure and the effects of the convolution .",
    "inhomogeneity is expected to lead to a decrease in total energy absorption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , therefore , to lower the emitted intensities . the fir emission in models @xmath22 and @xmath23 is respectively 2% and 5% lower than in model @xmath21 . the fuv absorption , or the equivalent quantity @xmath44 , is 3.6% and 9.0% lower in models @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively than in model @xmath21",
    ". the larger variation of @xmath44 relative to @xmath45 is the result of a difference in the optical depths relevant to the two components . for optically thin radiation",
    "the absorption depends only on the total amount of absorbing material while for optically thick radiation the absorbed energy is proportional to the area filling factor . since the optical depth is higher for the fuv radiation than for the longer wavelengths heating the grains , the quantity @xmath44 is more sensitive to the density contrast ( filling factor ) of the cloud .",
    "the equilibrium dust temperature for large grains , and consequently the fir emission , depends on longer wavelengths that are partly optically thin .",
    "therefore , in more clumpy clouds the reduction in @xmath45 is more modest than in @xmath44 .",
    "however , the value @xmath51 decreases from model @xmath21 to model @xmath23 by less than 2% .",
    "the interpretation of observations is affected by several other uncertainties , such as the imprecise knowledge of the dust properties or the strength of the external radiation field ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : discussion ] ) . a variation of 2% is insignificant compared with these other uncertainties .      in fig .",

    "differences between clouds can be attributed largely to differences in the dust composition . the photoelectric heating and therefore [ cii ] emission depends on the abundance of very small dust grains and pah  molecules while the far  infrared emission is caused mainly by large dust grains .",

    "variations in the radiation field are probably less important .    in the first approximation",
    "an increase in the strength of the radiation field affects fir and [ cii ] intensities in the same way .",
    "however , as the increased dust temperature moves dust emission to shorter wavelengths the fir intensity is reduced relative to the [ cii ] emission ( fuv absorption ) . assuming that the fir intensity in the models is fixed and constrained by the observations , if the interstellar radiation field is increased the dust column density must be decreased to maintain the fir intensity unchanged . as a result of the decreased column density , the [ cii ] emission is less saturated , and",
    "the ratio @xmath72 is increased .",
    "variations within individual clouds could similarly be caused by variations in the local radiation field or in the properties of the gas or dust .    in the",

    ". on the other hand , since the cloud has significant molecular line emission @xcite the total column density may not be very different from the model , and therefore the observed fir intensities do not imply a strong radiation field by themselves .",
    "furthermore , if one would accept the hypothesis of a strong radiation field , the low fir colour temperature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) would require a very low abundance of small dust grains .",
    "the scatter in the observed [ cii ] and fir intensities may depend on two effects not included in the models : i ) ci cooling and ii ) optical depth of the [ cii ] line .",
    "although the models assume all the cooling is from c@xmath15 , ci emission may be important on some lines of sight , increasing the observed scatter . according to @xcite the _ maximum _ contribution to the cooling from ci is approximately 30% .",
    "the scatter due to the the presence of ci cooling on some lines of sight should therefore be well below 15% .",
    "furthermore , the ci contribution can be significant only for high column density , and could not explain the scatter at low fir intensities .",
    "the models also assume that the [ cii ] line is optically thin .",
    "if the line became optically thick at some lines of sight , the main effect would be to flatten the @xmath49 vs. @xmath45 relation at high column densities , while the scatter would not be significantly affected .",
    "in the models , the saturation of @xmath49 is caused by the total absorption of the fuv radiation that is converted into [ cii ] emission , not by self ",
    "absorption of the [ cii ] line itself .",
    "since the observations do not show strong [ cii ] saturation with increasing fir intensity , the optical depth of the [ cii ] line can not be very high .",
    "the derived value of the photoelectric heating efficiency , @xmath1 , is close to theoretically derived values @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed theoretical calculations using a mrn type grain size distributions ( @xmath77 , * ? ? ?",
    "they found that about half of the heating rate is due to grains with sizes below 15   and the contribution from grains larger than 100   is insignificant .",
    "the net efficiency was calculated as a function of the parameter @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the intensity of the far - uv radiation field relative to habing s field @xcite , @xmath80 is gas temperature and @xmath81 the electron density .",
    "the estimated efficiency is constant @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "this prediction should apply to the cloud sample in @xcite .",
    "bakes & tielens found , however , that the predicted heating rate could be doubled if the exponent of the grain size distribution was decreased from -3.5 to -4.0 . since @xmath58 and fir intensity depend on large grains and the heating mainly on pahs the derived efficiency @xmath1 is model dependent .    in this paper",
    "we have used the dust model of @xcite .",
    "@xcite based their studies on the same dust model and considered further different size distributions discussed in @xcite . for cold neutral medium ( @xmath84100k ) and",
    "size distributions consistent with the diffuse cloud extinction law , @xmath853.1 , their predictions for the photoelectric heating rate are close to the values given by @xcite .",
    "the results depend on the carbon abundance which is limited by extinction measurements to values below @xmath86 carbon atoms per h nucleus @xcite",
    ". the models of @xcite and @xcite favoured carbon abundances close to this upper limit and the resulting rate of the photoelectric heating is some 25% above the value given by bakes & tielens @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived values of @xmath87=23% for the efficiency of the photoelectric heating across the cloud l1721 . compared with the ingalls et al",
    ". sample , the cloud has higher visual extinction , @xmath88 , and , due to the proximity of a b2 star , it is subjected to a stronger radiation field , @xmath89 . by adopting the dust model of @xcite , habart et al . were able to derive efficiencies of the photoelectric emission separately for pah , very small grain and large grain components . the derived efficiencies were @xmath90% for pahs , @xmath111% for very small grains and @xmath110.1% for large grains .",
    "part of the observed variation was attributed to changes in the abundance of the dust components .",
    "the clouds in the ingalls sample have lower visual extinction , and abundance variations are expected to be correspondingly smaller .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the balance between the column density and the strength of the radiation field . as discussed above ,",
    "if a stronger radiation field or a smaller column density were adopted in the models , the calculated ratio @xmath91 would increase and the derived value of @xmath1 decrease . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : map.y ] , the ratio @xmath51 increases up to 30% above its average value when moving from the cloud center to the cloud edges , where the radiation field is not attenuated .",
    "therefore , if the clouds had significantly lower extinction , the efficiency of the photoelectric heating could be lower by the same amount .",
    "we modified the model @xmath23 by reducing its column density by a factor of three and by multiplying the intensity of the external radiation field by a factor of two .",
    "the estimated average efficiency of the photoelectric heating decreased from 2.88@xmath3 to 2.25@xmath3 , i.e. only by 22% . based on hi and molecular line",
    "data the column densities are in most of the observed clouds within a factor of two from the average column density of the models . in this paper",
    "we have used for the intensity of the local isrf values given by @xcite and @xcite . according to @xcite and @xcite",
    "the actual isrf could be up to @xmath1170% stronger .",
    "however , the difference is very unlikely to be a factor of two .",
    "the actual errors caused by the uncertainty of the column density and intensity values is therefore less than 22% .",
    "compared with @xcite our estimate of the photoelectric heating efficiency is smaller by one third .",
    "most of the difference is due to a difference in the predicted fir intensity .",
    "for example , for a model with optical depth @xmath58=1.0  mag through the cloud ingalls et al",
    ". obtained a 100  @xmath13 m surface brightness of slightly more than 15mjysr@xmath69 .",
    "for a homogeneous , spherically symmetric cloud with equal optical depth we obtain a surface brightness of @xmath119.5mjysr@xmath69 .",
    "this is close to what @xcite obtained for a similar cloud model using the dust model of @xcite .",
    "the difference between our result and ingalls et al . can not be due to model geometry .",
    "one would expect _ more _ emission ( higher @xmath45 ) from a three dimensional cloud heated from all directions than from a plane parallel cloud heated on two surfaces only .",
    "the most likely explanation for the high fir intensities obtained by @xcite is their assumption of thermal equilibrium .",
    "this means that all grains are constantly at temperatures close to 20k and almost all absorbed energy is re - radiated in the fir . in our case a larger fraction of the absorbed energy is radiated at shorter wavelengths because of the small particles that are temporarily heated to much higher temperatures .",
    "we have calculated fir emission and [ cii ] line emission for three  dimensional density distributions of compressible magneto ",
    "hydrodynamic turbulent flows with rms sonic mach numbers @xmath92  0.6 , 2.5 , and 10.0 .",
    "the dust emission , @xmath45 , is computed with full radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the [ cii ] emission is estimated assuming the photoelectric heating caused by fuv photons between 0.0912@xmath13 m and 0.2066@xmath13 m is balanced by [ cii ] line emission .",
    "the fuv absorption is determined by the radiative transfer simulations , and is assumed to be equal to the [ cii ] line intensity divided by the unknown efficiency of the photoelectric heating , @xmath44 .",
    "the _ average _ ratio @xmath51 is in all models between 0.85 and 0.88 , showing that its dependence on the density contrast ( mach number ) is weak .",
    "however , dense filaments are visible in the maps as regions with lower value of @xmath51 .",
    "the degree of correlation between @xmath51 and visual extinction decreases in more inhomogeneous clouds . in the case of simulated observations convolved to different resolutions ( 71@xmath47 for [ cii ] and @xmath114@xmath36 for fir ) most of the correlation",
    "is lost .",
    "the scatter in the observational ( @xmath45,@xmath44 ) plot can be reproduced by models with rms mach number @xmath932 ( supersonic turbulence ) , showing that most of the scatter may be due to the inhomogeneous nature of the clouds ( likely due to the turbulence ) .",
    "in subsonic models ( @xmath941 ) both the scatter and the total range of fir and [ cii ] intensities become smaller than in the observed clouds . using the empirical value @xmath64=2.5@xmath3 found for high latitude clouds @xcite the efficiency of the photoelectric heating",
    "is found to be @xmath95 .",
