    "the determination of the total mass of the galaxy has been a subject of considerable interest since the work of kapteyn in the early 1920s ( see fich & tremaine 1991 for a nice introductory review on the subject ) . since then",
    ", the mass of the milky way has seen its estimates grow by factors of ten to a hundred , with some dependence on the type of mass tracer used : hikinematics , satellite galaxies and globular clusters , or the local group infall pattern .",
    "the most recent determinations yield fairly consistent values for the mass within 50 kpc , with an uncertainty of the order of 20% for a given mass model ( kochanek 1996 ; wilkinson & evans 1999 , hereafter w&e99 ; sakamoto , chiba & beers 2003 , hereafter scb03 ) . however , even today , the total mass of the galaxy is not known better than within a factor of two .",
    "whatever method is used , be it the hikinematics , globular clusters , satellite galaxies , or halo giants , it is only possible to determine the mass enclosed in the region probed by these tracers ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "this implies that the rotation curve derived from hiwill only constrain the mass within roughly 18 kpc from the galactic centre ( rohlfs & kreitschmann 1988 ; honma & sofue 1997 ) , a region which is baryon dominated .",
    "globular clusters and satellite galaxies are , in principle , better probes of the large scale mass distribution of the galaxy , since they are found out to distances beyond 100 kpc . however , there are only 15 such objects beyond 50 kpc ( zaritsky et al .",
    "1989 ; kochanek 1996 ) . only 6 of these",
    "have proper motion measurements , which despite the large errors , can further constrain the shape of the velocity ellipsoid . using this dataset , w&e99 favour isotropic to slightly tangentially anisotropic models , although 1@xmath5 contours for the velocity anisotropy @xmath6 give @xmath7 .",
    "scb03 have added to the sample used by w&e , field blue horizontal branch stars with proper motions and radial velocities . while this is clearly an improvement , these stars are located within 10 kpc of the sun , which strongly limits their constraining power at larger radii . in their models ,",
    "the velocity ellipsoid is tangentially anisotropic , with @xmath8 as the most likely value .",
    "it is clearly important to measure the total mass of the galaxy in order to constrain its dark - matter content .",
    "however , it is also critical to determine its distribution : density profile , flattening , velocity ellipsoid , etc .",
    "one of the most fundamental predictions of cold - dark matter models is that the density should follow an nfw profile throughout most of the halo ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) .",
    "the density profiles derived from the gas rotation curves of large samples of external galaxies do not always follow the nfw shape ( de blok et al .",
    "tracers at larger distances are rare , but objects such as planetary nebulae or globular clusters could yield powerful constrains on the mass distribution at those radii , for example for elliptical galaxies as shown by romanowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    in the case of the milky way ,",
    "the situation is not dissimilar .",
    "the distribution of mass inside the solar circle has been studied extensively ( see e.g. dehnen & binney 1998 ; evans & binney 2001 ; bissantz , debattista & gerhard 2004 ) .",
    "a common conclusion is that there is little room for dark - matter in this region of the galaxy .",
    "but does the dark - matter beyond the edge of the galactic disk follow an nfw profile ? how does the most often assumed isothermal profile perform in this region of the galaxy ( e.g. sommer - larsen et al . 1997 ; bellazzini 2004 ) ? is the velocity ellipsoid close to isotropic as found in cdm simulations ( ghigna et al .",
    "modeling of the kinematics of halo stars by sommer - larsen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) favoured an ellipsoid that became more tangentially anisotropic towards larger distances , while ratnatunga & freeman ( 1989 ) found a constant line - of - sight velocity dispersion out to 25 kpc .",
    "these fundamental issues can only be addressed when a sufficiently large number of probes of the outer halo of the galaxy are available .",
    "ideal tracers are red giant stars or blue horizontal branch stars , which can be identified photometrically also at large galactocentric distances ( morrison et al .",
    "2000 ; clewley et al .",
    "2002 ; sirko et al .",
    "2004a , b ) . spectroscopic follow - up allows both the confirmation of the luminosity class as well as the determination of radial velocities with relatively small errors ( morrison et al .",
    "2003 ) . with the advent of wide field surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey , or the spaghetti survey ,",
    "the numbers of such outer halo probes have increased by large amounts , making this an ideal time to address the mass distribution of our galaxy in greater detail .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the observational datasets used to determine the radial velocity dispersion curve . in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] we introduce several mass models for the dark halo of our galaxy and derive how the line of sight velocity dispersion depends on the model parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we compare the data to the models and derive the best fit values of the parameters using @xmath9 fitting .",
    "finally we discuss our results and future prospects in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    ".characteristics of the data used in this paper . in all cases ,",
    "position in the sky , heliocentric distance and line of sight velocities are available . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have derived the radial velocity dispersion profile of the stellar halo of the milky way using a sample of 240 halo objects with accurate distance and radial velocity measurements . the new data from the `` spaghetti '' survey led to a significant increase in the number of known objects for galactocentric radii beyond 50 kpc , which allowed a more reliable determination of the dispersion profile out to very large distances .",
    "our most distant probes are located at @xmath10 kpc , which in comparison to previous works ( e.g. sommer - larsen et al .",
    "1997 ) corresponds to an increase of 70 kpc in probing the outer halo .",
    "the galactocentric radial velocity dispersion measured is approximately constant ( @xmath11 120 km  s@xmath0 ) out to 30 kpc ( consistent with ratnatunga & freeman 1986 ) and then it shows a continuous decline out to the last measured point ( 50 @xmath12 22 km  s@xmath0at 120 kpc )",
    ". this fall - off has important implications for the density profile of the dark matter halo of the milky way .",
    "in particular , in the hypothesis of a constant velocity anisotropy , an isothermal sphere can be immediately ruled out as model for the galactic dark halo as this predicts a nearly constant radial velocity dispersion curve .",
    "we have also considered two other possible models for the dark halo : a truncated flat ( tf ) and a navarro , frenk & white ( nfw ) profile .",
    "we have compared the radial velocity dispersion observed with that predicted in these models for a tracer population ( stellar halo ) embedded in a potential provided by the dark halo . by means of a @xmath9 test",
    ", we were able to derive the characteristic parameters and velocity anisotropy of these models that are most consistent with the observed data .",
    "in the case of a tf profile , the favourite model for the milky way dark matter halo has a mass @xmath13@xmath2 , with a corresponding velocity anisotropy @xmath14 . the data are also compatible with an nfw dark halo of @xmath15 @xmath2and @xmath160.3@xmath17 for a concentration @xmath418 .",
    "the comparison of the fits produced by the constant anisotropy tf and nfw models shows that the latter reproduces better the trends in the data as a whole , from small to large radii .",
    "however , at very large radii it tends to overpredict the velocity dispersion . in this regime",
    "the tf model having a steeper density profile provides a much better fit .",
    "our determination of the dark halo mass of the milky way is consistent with previous works : the preferred tf model of w&e99 gives a mass @xmath18@xmath2 , with a 1-@xmath5 range of @xmath19@xmath2@xmath20 < 5.5 $ ] and @xmath21 ; the favourite model from klypin et al .",
    "2002 gives @xmath22 @xmath2with @xmath412 .",
    "however , the radial velocity dispersion predicted by these two models is larger than the observed one .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed low values of the radial velocity dispersion at large radii and that predicted for heavy dark halos raises the question of whether the velocity dispersion in the two most distant bins may be affected by systematics , such as the presence of streams , which could lower their values .",
    "the two bins in question are centered at @xmath23 kpc and @xmath10 kpc , and contain 6 and 3 objects respectively : 4 satellite galaxies and 5 globular clusters .",
    "the minimum angular separation of any two objects in these bins is 40@xmath24 , for the satellites , and 49@xmath24 , for the gcs .",
    "when considering the sample with 9 objects only two of these objects appear to be close on the sky : one globular cluster and one satellite galaxy that are located at @xmath25 ( 241@xmath24,42@xmath24 ) . although these are at similar distances of 96 kpc and 89 kpc , respectively , their line of sight radial velocities differ by more than 140 km  s@xmath0 , thus making any physical association extremely unlikely .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of a velocity anisotropy that varies with radius on the velocity dispersion @xmath26 in the case of an nfw halo of concentration @xmath418 .",
    "we find that the velocity anisotropy , which is radial at the solar neighborhood , needs to become more tangentially anisotropic with radius in order to fit the observed rapid decline in @xmath26 . in the case of an isothermal dark matter",
    "halo , the @xmath6 profile needs to decline even more steeply than in the nfw case in order to fit the data .",
    "we conclude that the behaviour of the observed velocity dispersion can be explained either by a dark matter halo following a steep density profile at large radii and constant velocity anisotropy , or by a halo with a less steep profile whose velocity ellipsoid becomes tangentially anisotropic at large radii . in order to distinguish between an nfw profile and a tf model , proper motions are fundamental since they enable the direct determination of the velocity anisotropy profile .",
    "proper motions of gcs and satellites are becoming available ( dinescu et al . 1999 ; piatek et al . 2003 ; dinescu et al .",
    "2004 ) albeit with large errors because of the very distant location of these objects .",
    "we may have to wait until gaia is launched to determine the density profile of the galactic dark - matter halo .",
