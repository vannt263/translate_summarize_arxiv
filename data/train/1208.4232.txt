    "<S> note , however , that for the graphite with @xmath86 , it is extremely difficult for a macroscopic sphere ( 10 nm ) to spin so fast . even for diatomic molecules , </S>",
    "<S> the rotational constant typically varies from about @xmath87 to @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , considering these experimental challenges , it can be more advantageous to utilize materials with poorer conductivity such as semiconductors . for instance , the conductivities of germanium and silicon are in the @xmath89 to @xmath90 range , depending on the impurity concentration @xcite .    _ realistic semiconductor material_.in the following , we study quantum friction using a realistic semiconductor material , insb . </S>",

    "<S> four singular spots at the intersections of the four singular lines correspond to those three peaks at @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the spp excitations can further enhance quantum friction by several orders of magnitude even at t=0 once the rotation frequency @xmath2 reaches the plasmon resonance frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> it also indicates that insulators such as sic or sio@xmath123 , which exhibit phonon polaritons in the infrared , can not produce considerable quantum friction at t=0 until the spinning speed reaches the polariton frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have made a theoretical investigation of the quantum friction acting on a sphere rotating near a surface . </S>",
