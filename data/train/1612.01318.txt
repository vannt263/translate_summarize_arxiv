    "following the ideas , motivations , and objectives of @xcite , where we prove that the structure of lines with binary coplanarity relation is a sufficient system of primitive notions for grassmann spaces and polar grassmann spaces , we use similar methods to prove the same for spine spaces .",
    "as previously , the key role play cliques of coplanarity which are contained in strong subspaces . the structure of strong subspaces in spine spaces is much more complex but",
    "pretty well known if we take a look into @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the major difference is that we have to deal with three types of lines here as strong subspaces can be projective , semi - affine or affine spaces .",
    "a point - line structure @xmath0 , where the elements of @xmath1 are called _ points _ , the elements of @xmath2 are called _ lines _ , and where @xmath3 , is said to be a _ partial linear space _ , or a _ point - line space _ , if two distinct lines share at most one point and every line is of size ( cardinality ) at least 2 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    a _ subspace _ of @xmath4 is any set @xmath5 with the property that every line which shares with @xmath6 two or more points is entirely contained in @xmath6 .",

    "if @xmath1 is strong then @xmath4 is said to be a _",
    "linear space_. a _ plane _ in @xmath4 is a strong subspace @xmath7 of @xmath8 with the property that the restriction of @xmath4 to @xmath7 is a projective or semi - affine plane . for lines",
    "@xmath9 we say that they are _ coplanar _ and write @xmath10 for a subspace @xmath6 of @xmath4 we write @xmath11 let us fix a subset @xmath12 .",
    "consider the structure @xmath13 where @xmath14 which is a fragment of @xmath4 .",
    "note that @xmath8 is a partial linear space .",
    "the incidence relation in @xmath8 is again @xmath15 , inherited from @xmath4 , but limited to the new point set and line set .",
    "following a standard convention we call the points and lines of @xmath8 _ proper _ , and those points and lines of @xmath8 that are not in @xmath16 , @xmath17 respectively are said to be _",
    "improper_. the set @xmath18 will be called the _ horizon of @xmath8_. if @xmath19 is a proper or improper point in a subspace @xmath6 of @xmath8 , then we write @xmath20 if @xmath7 is a plane in @xmath8 , then @xmath21 is a @xmath22-clique .",
    "we call such cliques _ flats_.",

    "it is trivial that every line , a @xmath28-pencil @xmath45 , of @xmath8 can be uniquely extended to the star @xmath46 and to the top @xmath47 .",
    "a _ spine space _ is a fragment of a grassmann space chosen so that it consists of subspaces of @xmath24 which meet a fixed subspace in a specified way .",
    "the concept of spine spaces was introduced in @xcite and developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath48 be a fixed subspace of @xmath24 and let @xmath49 be an integer with @xmath50 from the points of the grassmann space @xmath51 we take those which as subspaces of @xmath24 meet @xmath48 in dimension @xmath49 , that is : @xmath52 as new lines we take those lines of @xmath51 which have at least two new points : @xmath53 the point - line structure : @xmath54 will be called a _",

    "specifically , depending on @xmath55 and @xmath56 it can be : a projective space , a slit space ( cf .",

    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as @xmath8 is a fragment of the grassmann space @xmath51 we can distinguishe a set @xmath18 of improper points in @xmath8 , i.e.  a horizon .",
    "a line @xmath57 of @xmath51 either , is entirely contained in @xmath18 , meets @xmath18 in all except one points , meets @xmath18 in precisely one point , or is disjoint to @xmath18 . only in the last two cases new lines",
    "arise : they will be called _ affine _ and _ projective _ , respectively .",
    "note that for affine lines we can define parallelism in a natural way : those lines are parallel which meet in @xmath18 .",
    "the class of affine lines is denoted by @xmath58 and projective lines fall into two disjoint classes @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for details see table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    ".the classification of lines in a spine space ( k , m , v , w ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a line of @xmath8 can be in at most two maximal strong subspaces of different type : a star and a top .",
    "[ fact : spineintersections ] a projective star and a projective top are either disjoint or they share a point . in remaining cases , a star and a top",
    "are either disjoint or they share a line .",
    "two stars ( or two tops ) are either disjoint or they share a point .    [ lem : spineplanes ] three pairwise coplanar and concurrent , or parallel , lines not all on a plane span a star or a top .",
    "there are three planes and it suffices to note by [ fact : spineintersections ] that no two of them can be of distinct type , i.e.  they all are of type star or top .",
    "consequently , all these lines lie in one maximal strong subspace .",
    "let @xmath8 be a spine space .",
    "the goal now is to show that the set of lines equipped with coplanarity relation @xmath22 is a sufficient system of primitive notions for @xmath8 .",
    "as it was mentioned before , we can speak about the horizon in case of spine spaces . from this point of view a vertex @xmath19 of a semibundle @xmath23",
    "can be either proper or improper . thus the name _ proper _ and _ improper semibundle_. we omit the adjective when we mean a semibundle in general .",
    "let @xmath61 be a maximal @xmath22-clique which is not a flat .",
    "so , there are three pairwise distinct lines in @xmath61 not all on a plane .",
    "they all meet in a point @xmath19 , possibly improper .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath62 we have @xmath63 .",
    "now , let @xmath70 be the grassmann space embracing @xmath8 , and let @xmath71 be a maximal collinearity clique in @xmath70 containing @xmath65 .",
    "set @xmath72 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath73 .",
    "as @xmath70 is a gamma space @xmath71 is a maximal strong subspace of @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 is a maximal strong subspace of @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath74 .",
    "take a point @xmath75 distinct from @xmath19 .",
    "there is a , possibly affine , line @xmath76 contained in @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath71 is , up to an isomorphism , a projective space , all the lines through @xmath19 in @xmath71 are pairwise coplanar , so @xmath77 . hence @xmath78 and consequently @xmath79 .",
    "we have actually shown that @xmath80 which means that @xmath61 is a semibundle .",
    "the reasoning in [ lem : max - copla - cliques ] is universal in that it remains valid for general grassmann spaces discussed in @xcite and for polar spine spaces discussed later in this paper .",
    "it is worth to point out here that lemma  1.3 in @xcite states the same as [ lem : max - copla - cliques ] for general grassmann spaces but its proof fails to be complete .    as indispensable as the property of the family of maximal @xmath22-cliques provided by [ lem : max - copla - cliques ] is the characterization of this family in terms of lines and coplanarity , that is an elementary definition of maximal @xmath22-cliques within @xmath81 .",
    "we can assume that all stars as projective spaces have dimension @xmath82 and all tops have dimension @xmath83 .",
    "without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath84 . for lines",
    "@xmath85 we define @xmath86 note that for @xmath87 the relation @xmath88 is empty , while for @xmath89 it says that the lines @xmath90 form a @xmath22-clique , they are not in a pencil , and they could not be contained in the intersection of two @xmath22-cliques . in grassmann spaces and spine spaces ,",
    "two distinct @xmath22-cliques share at most one line .",
    "this is because two strong subspaces share at most a line .",
    "it is different in polar grassmann spaces , where two star semibundles can have a lot more in common ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note that in grassmann spaces and spine spaces 3 lines are enough in . in case of polar grassmann spaces",
    "however @xmath82 lines are required . to explain this",
    "let us take @xmath91 lines @xmath92 , which are pairwise coplanar , but not all lie on a plane .",
    "assume that these lines are contained in a star @xmath1 of dimension @xmath82 and @xmath93 .",
    "then , in considered polar geometries there is another star @xmath94 which contains all the lines @xmath92 .",
    "we can find two lines @xmath95 such that @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 but @xmath100 .",
    "it means that @xmath88 fails to be true for @xmath101 .          in view of [ lem : spinecliques ] the set @xmath104 consists of two families : semibundles and flats . by [ fact : spineintersections ] the intersection of a flat with a semibundle in a spine space is the empty set , a line , or a pencil of lines .",
    "two distinct maximal @xmath22-cliques of the same type are disjoint or share a line .",
    "hence we get the following          loosely speaking , a plane is affine if it contains two disjoint pencils .",
    "a pencil @xmath115 lies on an affine plane iff there are two distinct pencils @xmath107 such that @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath114 .",
    "we say that a line @xmath118 lies on an affine plane iff there is a pencil @xmath115 such that @xmath119 and @xmath120 lies on an affine plane .",
    "if a pencil @xmath115 does not lie on an affine plane and every @xmath119 lies on an affine plane , then we call @xmath120 a _ punctured _ pencil .",
    "a pencil is punctured iff its vertex is an improper point and it lies on a punctured plane .",
    "a maximal @xmath22-clique is _ proper _ if it contains no improper or punctured pencil .",
    "let us recall that our goal is to reconstruct the point universe of a spine space given a line universe equipped with coplanarity relation .",
    "the idea is to use vertices of semibudles to do that .",
    "this means that only proper @xmath22-cliques are of our concern .",
    "note that a proper maximal @xmath22-clique together with pencils of lines it contains carries the structure of a projective space .",
    "the geometrical dimension of a proper flat is always 2 whereas a proper semibundle @xmath23 has dimension one less then the dimension of @xmath6 .",
    "this lets us distinguish proper flats from proper semibundles if we assume that @xmath121 that is , in view of and table  [ tab : subs ] , respectively @xmath122      [ lem : semibundle - flaty ] the family @xmath126 defined in @xmath81 coincides with the family of all proper top semibundles , the family of all proper star semibundles or the union of these two families depending on whether tops , stars or all of them are at least 4 dimensional projective or semi - affine spaces",
    ".          by there are lines @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which are coplanar .",
    "note that @xmath136 and @xmath137 as we assume that @xmath131 .",
    "let @xmath138 be a plane containing @xmath139",
    ". then @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "in view of [ fact : spineintersections ] it means that @xmath132 are both of the same type and @xmath138 is of different type .",
    "there is another pair of coplanar lines @xmath142 such that @xmath143 and @xmath144 , since @xmath130 .",
    "let @xmath145 be the plane spanned by @xmath142 .",
    "note that @xmath146 are planes of the same type .",
    "as @xmath147 , by [ fact : spineintersections ] we get that @xmath148 or @xmath149 . if @xmath148 , then @xmath150 which yields a contradiction as @xmath151 are of the same type .    the inverse of [ lem : zlepsemibundle1 ] is not true in general .",
    "let @xmath152 be a semi - affine , but not affine , star .",
    "then @xmath152 is an @xmath153-star ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "take a projective line @xmath154 .",
    "the line @xmath57 is an @xmath153-line and the unique top - extension of @xmath57 is an @xmath153-top @xmath155 , that is a projective space . in case @xmath156",

    "therefore we can not find a line in @xmath156 , which is coplanar with @xmath57 .",
    "however , two affine lines in @xmath159 are enough to fix this problem .",
    "so , it means that @xmath152 can not be a punctured projective space as in such there is only one affine line through a given proper point .    in view of table  [",

    "if @xmath152 is a projective space ( i.e.  it is an @xmath157-star ) , then we take two distinct projective @xmath157-lines @xmath164 .",
    "each of @xmath165 can be extended to the semi - affine @xmath157-top @xmath166 , respectively .",

    "there are two distinct affine lines @xmath172 as @xmath152 is not a punctured projective space . as in the first case we extend @xmath165 to the semi - affine tops and we get our claim .          for a proper semibundle @xmath177",
    "we write @xmath178 we will show that it is the bundle of all lines through the point determined by the semibundle @xmath61 . thanks to and all stars or all tops , no matter if they are @xmath153 or @xmath157 , are at least 4 dimensional and are not punctured .",
    "this is essential here .",
    "the left - to - right inclusion is immediate by [ lem : zlepsemibundle ] . to show the right - to - left inclusion let @xmath57 be a line through @xmath19 .",
    "by there is a maximal strong subspace @xmath155 of the same type as @xmath6 which contains @xmath57 and by it is not a punctured projective space .",
