    "this is highly contrasted with the negligibly polarized cases of the transmitted flux shown in the middle and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ spec_tran_slab_flat ] .    this contrasting behavior can be understood by considering the fact that the reflected flux is quite significantly contributed by the singly rayleigh scattered near the point of entry .",

    "because the incident radiation is prepared in the wavelength range @xmath112  @xmath113   throughout all the monte carlo simulations presented in this work , the larger wavelength range for @xmath114 for @xmath43 than for @xmath101 implies that the slab in the case of top left panel is optically thin to more incident photons than in the case of bottom left .",
    "the rayleigh scattering phase function is forward and backward symmetric so that an optically thin slab shows the same polarization behavior for transmitted and reflected components .",

    "[ torus_polarization ] , we illustrate the development of polarization in a torus model . in the tall and optically thick torus , photons tend to be polarized in the direction perpendicular to the vertical axis as they diffuse along the vertical direction through a large number of scattering near the inner wall .",

    "this is in contrast with the case of @xmath128 shown in the bottom left panel . in the case of @xmath123 , the polarization behavior resembles that of the wing photons reflected in a slab illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tpol_slab_mock ] .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath128 the polarization behavior resembles that of the transmitted component .",
    "totally different behaviors are noticed in the case of the transfer of core photons ( @xmath131 ) . in the top right panel for @xmath123",
    "all the core photons are polarized in the direction parallel to the symmetry axis , which is the same as their wing counterparts .",
    "the degree of polarization is smaller due to the increased number of scatterings required before escape for core photons .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath128 shown in the bottom right panel , core photons are polarized in the perpendicular direction . in this scattering geometry , an core photon needs to climb up along the inner wall of the cylindrical shell by repeated bouncings before it makes the final exit of the scattering region . in the random",
    "walk type process of moving up and down along the inner wall , the electric field associated with the photon relaxes in the direction perpendicular to the symmetry axis .",

    "@xmath133 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ spec_torus_mock ] , we show our monte carlo simulated profiles and polarization of emergent radiation that is rayleigh scattered in a torus region .",
    "the incident radiation consists of a flat continuum and a broad ly@xmath1 emission component with a triangular profile , which was considered in section 3.2.3 .",
    "the top panels show the data for radiation emergent nearly along the symmetry axis , which is negligibly polarized . however , the profiles are augmented by the rayleigh scattered flux . for small @xmath134 rayleigh scattering is limited to photons near line center leading to a spiky central feature .    in the middle panels for emergent radiation with @xmath135 , the behavior of polarization flip is apparent .",
    "the center part where the scattering optical thickness exceeds unity is polarized in the perpendicular direction .",
    "the wing regions exhibit polarization in the parallel direction due to dominant contribution from a small number of scattering occurring in the @xmath127 plane .",
    "the bottom panel shows the simulated data for grazingly emergent radiation .",
    "the largest degree of polarization is obtained near the shoulder region with moderate scattering optical depth . in the far wing region where the scattering optical depth is very small ,",
    "the degree of polarization is small due to the contribution from the unpolarized incident radiation that is not rayleigh scattered .",
    "[ spec_torus_mock_a1 ] shows our monte carlo result for a short torus , for which the behavior is in high contrast with that illustrated in fig.[spec_torus_mock ] .",
    "in particular , in the middle panel , one can see that rayleigh scattered radiation near ly@xmath1 is polarized in the direction parallel to the symmetry axis and no polarization flip appears . in the bottom panel for which the anisotropy is maximal , the degree of polarization is enhanced and particularly the shoulder part exhibits the degree of polarization in excess of 10 percent .",
    "in this work , we compute the flux and polarization of the far uv radiation around ly@xmath1 rayleigh scattered in a slab and a torus in order to develop a new spectropolarimetric tool to investigate the unification models of agns . in the slab geometry ,",
    "the transmitted radiation is weakly polarized with the profile exhibiting a central dip in the flux whereas the rayleigh reflected radiation is significantly polarized with an enhanced line center .    in the torus geometry we find an interesting behavior of polarization flip dependent on the shape of the torus .",
    "when the torus is tall with the shape parameter @xmath136 , the rayleigh thick part near the line center is polarized in the direction perpendicular to the symmetry axis whereas the wing parts are polarized in the parallel direction .",
    "however in the case of a short torus model with @xmath123 , no polarization flip is observed and the emergent radiation is polarized in the direction parallel to the symmetry axis .",
    "it has been proposed that hard x - ray background radiation is significantly contributed by type 2 agns ( e , g .",
    ". however , the population of type 2 agns is only poorly constrained @xcite . according to agn unification models ,",
    "type 2 agn population is closely related with the geometrical covering factor of the molecular torus . in view of this , detection of polarized ly@xmath1 exhibiting a polarization flip in the wing parts may indicate the presence of a tall molecular torus implying a fairly large population of type 2 agns .",
    "the models adopted in this work are highly ideal and the distribution is more probably far from being axisymmetric . in this case , spectropolarimetric observations may reveal ly@xmath1 polarized in different directions depending on wavelength because the rayleigh scattering optical thickness has no axisymmetry . in this work we made no consideration of narrow ly@xmath1 emission component , which may fill the central dip shown in the rayleigh transmitted component and introduce an additional polarized component .",
    "the rayleigh scattering cross section is given as a squared sum consisting of contributions from each bound @xmath23 and free @xmath25 state .",
    "for a photon in the vicinity of ly@xmath1 , the @xmath137 state provides a dominant contribution .",
    "a minor contribution from the remaining @xmath138 states affects the final cross section in a complicated way so that the cross section is larger for radiation redward of ly@xmath1 than blueward @xcite .",
    "more quantitatively , for red and blue wavelengths around ly@xmath1 , @xmath139 corresponding to the doppler velocity @xmath140 , the asymmetry amounts to @xmath141 the asymmetry amounting to 7 percent in scattering cross section will be more easily detected in the polarized flux than in the total flux .",
    "a small excess in the polarized flux redward of ly@xmath1 can be regarded as a convincing signature of rayleigh scattering .",
    "lying at @xmath142 redward of ly@xmath1 , the broad @xmath31240 line is often severely blended with the broad ly@xmath1 in many agns .",
    "this leads to the possibility that the line photons can be rayleigh scattered , which will also enhance the red part of ly@xmath1 .",
    "however , the red enhancement due to is expected to peak at @xmath143 , whereas the red enhancement due to asymmetry in cross section is featureless .",
    "one notable example is provided by @xcite , who used the _ hubble space telescope _ to perform spectropolarimetry of the quasar pg  1630 + 377 .",
    "they reported that ly@xmath1 in this object is significantly polarized with the degree of polarization 7 per cent after correction for unpolarized continuum , whereas no evidence of strong polarization was found in other lines .",
    "this is an interesting case because only ly@xmath1 can be significantly polarized when the main scattering mechanism is rayleigh . however ,",
    "their spectral resolution was too insufficient to reveal any polarization structures , which hinders one from drawing a definite conclusion .",
    "future spectropolarimetric observations will shed much light on the agn unification model .",
