    "intervening massive structures can , via weak gravitational lensing , alter the density of high - redshift objects detected behind them .",
    "myers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) demonstrated the anti - correlation between faint qsos and groups of galaxies , confirming the earlier detection by boyle , fong & shanks ( 1988 ) . using models of lensing by simple haloes ( croom & shanks 1999 ) they concluded that , if due to gravitational lensing , the observed anti - correlation favoured more mass in groups of galaxies than accounted for in a universe with density parameter @xmath9 .",
    "though statistical lensing is most apparent for larger concentrations of mass , such as groups of galaxies , most recent attempts to measure and model associations between qsos and foreground mass have focussed on the cross - correlation between qsos and individual galaxies .",
    "seldner & peebles ( 1979 ) were among the first authors to record a statistically significant clustering of individual galaxies with bright , high - redshift qsos , although tyson ( 1986 ) appears to be the first to have mentioned lensing as a possible explanation .",
    "webster et al . (",
    "1988 ) developed a statistical lensing explanation for the association of qsos with foreground galaxies , suggesting that more lensing mass must be being traced than expected @xcite .",
    "since then , more authors have found positive correlations between optically - selected qsos and galaxies @xcite .",
    "many more have measured positive correlations between galaxies and radio - selected qsos @xcite , for which a larger lensing effect is expected . very few _",
    "anti_-correlations between qsos and galaxies have been detected @xcite , and these were mainly attributed to qso - selection effects .",
    "however , as detected by myers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , an anti - correlation between _ faint _ qsos and foreground matter is predicted by statistical lensing .    the galaxy distribution , relative to underlying mass , is a function of bias , whereas the qso distribution directly traces the mass that lensed it .",
    "thus , comparing the qso - galaxy cross - correlation to the galaxy auto - correlation can be used to constrain galaxy bias .",
    "recent observations of positive correlations between bright qsos and galaxies @xcite suggest a very low value for the bias parameter ( @xmath5  @xmath10  0.1 ) .",
    "the work of gaztaaga ( 2003 ) suggests @xmath5  @xmath10  0.1 on sub - megaparsec scales .",
    "the work of williams & irwin ( 1998 ) suggests @xmath5  @xmath10  0.1 on megaparsec scales but is consistent with @xmath5  @xmath10  0.1 on sub - megaparsec scales .",
    "however , measurements of the strength of bias from clustering in galaxy surveys out to ( redshift ) @xmath11 @xcite , comparisons of local galaxy clustering with the cosmic microwave background @xcite and weak lensing shear @xcite at @xmath12 , seem to converge on a linear model of bias with @xmath5 , of the order of unity on scales of @xmath13 .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that either there is a strong scale - dependence to bias , or that there exists an unexpected , strong systematic effect inducing positive correlations between qsos and foreground galaxies .",
    "the faint flux limit of the 2df qso redshift survey @xcite , henceforth referred to as the ` 2qz ' , may test these two possibilities . as the 2qz number - magnitude count slope at the survey flux limit is relatively flat , statistical lensing predicts an anti - correlation between 2qz qsos and foreground galaxies , as opposed to the positive correlations predicted for brighter qso samples and detected by williams & irwin ( 1998 ) and gaztaaga ( 2003 ) . as there is no other explanation for such opposite signals in the different samples , such a detection would provide a strong confirmation of the lensing hypothesis , and hence the constraints on @xmath5 .",
    "there are additional reasons why the 2qz is appropriate to study statistical lensing .",
    "the 2qz contains around half as many confirmed stars as qsos , which may be used as a control , to determine if any cross - correlation arises from target - selection .",
    "the 2qz can limit the most likely systematic , intervening dust  by considering qso colours , the extent that dust in galaxies could obscure background qsos may be determined . finally , the known redshifts of 2qz qsos can ensure that they are physically removed from a galaxy sample .",
    "this paper regards the cross - correlation between faint qsos and foreground galaxies , and its implications for cosmological parameters , particularly for galaxy bias . in section  [ sec : data5 ]",
    "we outline the samples of qsos and galaxies we shall cross - correlate . in section  [ sec : cross5 ]",
    "we outline our cross - correlation methodology , and investigate possible explanations for the resulting signal .",
    "section  [ sec : model5 ] introduces models we use to investigate the cross - correlation of qsos and galaxies in terms of statistical lensing .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss5 ] applies these lensing models and discusses implications for cosmological parameters , especially how galaxies are biased relative to underlying matter .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary5 ] , we summarise the main results of this paper .",
    "the qso and galaxy samples we will cross - correlate are essentially the same as described by myers et al . (",
    "2003 ) , so we will only outline them briefly .",
    "qsos are taken from the final 2qz catalogue @xcite .",
    "the 2qz comprises two @xmath14 declination strips , one in an equatorial region in the north galactic cap ( centred at @xmath15 with 09@xmath1650@xmath17 @xmath18 14@xmath1950@xmath17 ) , and one at the south galactic pole ( centred at @xmath20 , with 21@xmath1640@xmath17 @xmath18 03@xmath1615@xmath17 ) .",
    "we will refer to these regions as the ` ngc ' and ` sgc ' respectively .",
    "qsos are selected by ultra - violet excess ( uvx ) in the @xmath21 plane , in the magnitude range @xmath22 .",
    "the 2qz colour selection is @xmath23 per cent complete for uvx qsos over the redshift range @xmath24 . at higher redshifts",
    "the uvx technique fails as the lyman - alpha forest enters the @xmath25 band , and the completeness of the survey rapidly drops .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we will consider only qsos with a redshift @xmath26 , to prevent the overlap in real space of qso and galaxy samples .",
    "we shall work with only the most definitively identified qso sample , the so - called quality ` 11 ' sample .",
    "quality ` 11 ' denotes a sample with the best level of reliability for both the qso identification and redshift estimate ( see croom et al .",
    "2004 for further explanation ) .",
    "these restrictions in redshift and spectroscopic quality leave 12042 qsos in the sgc and 9565 in the ngc .",
    "we shall also consider the supplemental 6df qso survey ( henceforth 6qz ) , which contains 376 qsos after the application of our @xmath26 and ` 11 ' only spectroscopic identification criteria .",
    "for further details of the 2qz and 6qz , see croom et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the expected strength of lensing - induced correlations between galaxies and a magnitude - limited sample of qsos depends on the slope of the integrated number - magnitude counts , @xmath27 , fainter than the qso sample s limit @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of qsos is expected behind foreground lenses when the slope of the qso number - magnitude counts is greater than 0.4 and a deficit when the slope is less than 0.4 .",
    "we thus need to estimate this slope for any lensing analysis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmag.eps ] we reproduce the qso @xmath28 for the 2qz from myers et al .",
    "the points are qso number counts in 0.2  mag bins with poisson errors , and have been corrected for incompleteness and absorption by dust in our galaxy .",
    "the line is a smoothed power law fit to the differential counts of form    @xmath29    with a steep bright - end slope ( @xmath30 ) , a knee at @xmath31 , and a flatter faint end slope ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "myers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) marginalised across all of the parameters in this fit and determined a faint end slope of @xmath33 , noting that incompleteness corrections might raise the @xmath34 error to as much as 0.05 .",
    "in this paper , we will assume a slope of @xmath35 at the survey flux limit .",
    "brighter data points are from the 6qz . also displayed are the faint data from boyle , jones & shanks ( 1991 ) and koo & kron ( 1988 ) , which have been offset slightly to prevent points from merging .",
    "recent observations , attributed to statistical lensing , of positive correlations between qsos and galaxies @xcite have used relatively bright qso samples , which only probe the steep qso number - magnitude counts below the knee .",
    "the large size and faint flux limit of the 2qz allows us to probe significantly beyond the knee and test the lensing prediction of an anti - correlation between _ faint _ qsos and galaxies .",
    "the southern galaxy sample we consider in this paper is taken from the apm survey @xcite , which is considered photometrically complete to a magnitude of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the northern galaxy sample is taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( henceforth sdss ) early data release ( henceforth edr ) of june 2001 @xcite .",
    "the sdss edr sample is transformed into the @xmath37 band from the sdss @xmath38 and @xmath39 bands using the colour equations of yasuda et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and cut to @xmath36 to match the apm limit .",
    "both galaxy samples are restricted to areas in which they overlap the 2qz strips .",
    "this leaves nearly 200,000 galaxies in the sgc 2qz strip and 100,000 in the ngc 2qz strip .",
    "note that the sdss edr only partially fills the 2qz ngc strip .",
    "correlation functions @xcite are the main statistic of choice in studies of how qso and galaxy distributions are related , although how the statistic is estimated varies considerably . in this section ,",
    "we measure the two - point cross - correlation between sdss or apm galaxies and 2qz ( or 6qz ) qsos .",
    "we study possible selection effects and different explanations for the signal .",
    "notably , the expected variation of the qso - galaxy cross - correlation with redshift and ( especially ) magnitude of the qso sample is a strong prediction of the statistical lensing hypothesis , and is something we may be able to test using 2qz data .      to measure the two - point correlation function , @xmath40",
    ", we use the estimator @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the number of data - point _ pairs _ drawn from populations 1 and 2 respectively with separation @xmath43 . for @xmath44 the population 2 data are replaced with a catalogue of random points with the same angular selection function as the data .",
    "the factor @xmath45 is the ratio of the size of the random catalogue to the data . throughout this paper ,",
    "we produce random catalogues with @xmath46 , minimizing statistical noise but allowing efficient speed of calculation . for further details on the 2qz angular selection function",
    "see outram et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and croom et al .",
    "note that the cross - correlation function is equivalent in either ` direction ' ( i.e. under the exchange of labels @xmath47 and @xmath48 in equation  [ equation : corrfunc5 ] ) _ provided that the angular selection of sources is accounted for by an appropriate random catalogue_. in general , the angular selection functions of , say , a galaxy population and a qso population are not the same .",
    "further , the angular completeness of a given survey is generally a function of redshift and magnitude , so considerable care should be taken in constructing random catalogues for population subsamples .",
    "numerous estimates of error on the cross - correlation have been proposed .",
    "we will consider three of these .",
    "one of the simpler forms , is the poisson error based on the number of data - data pairs ( across the entire survey ) in the angular bin probed : @xmath49 ^ 2}{dd(\\theta ) } \\label{equation : poisdd}\\ ] ] where we will use @xmath50 to denote the standard error on the correlation function . given that we wish to measure the significance of the correlation function compared to the null hypothesis represented by the random catalogue , we might instead use the poisson error based on the number of data - random pairs , which could be achieved by substituting @xmath51 for @xmath52 in equation  [ equation : poisdd ] .    the hypothesis that error on the correlation function is poisson is not strictly fair .",
    "all else being equal , the number of counts could be highly correlated as the same points appear in different pairs that are included in many different bins , especially on large scales .",
    "some authors @xcite have suggested corrections to the poisson form of error . instead of such corrections , we will consider errors from field - to - field variations in the correlation function ( see , e.g. , stevenson et al .",
    "our data samples are split into 30 subsamples .",
    "this is arbitrary in the case of the sdss edr but deliberately reflects plate boundaries in the case of the apm data ( and by extension the 2qz , which is derived from apm photometry ) .",
    "the cross - correlation function is measured for each subsample and the variance between the subsamples is determined .",
    "the standard error on @xmath40 is then the standard error between the subsamples , inverse weighted by variance to account for different numbers of objects in each subsample @xmath53 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{equation : ftferr}\\ ] ] the weighting by number of objects is essential , mainly as plates in the southern apm immediately east of 00h ra cover less area than other plates at the same declination but also because of varying completeness in the qso catalogue",
    ". we will refer to this error as _ field - to - field error_.    we will also consider a similar estimate of error to equation  [ equation : ftferr ] , essentially a weighted form of the estimate proposed by scranton et al . (",
    "2002 ) when calculating the auto - correlation of galaxies in the sdss edr @xmath54 ^ 2 \\label{equation : jackerr}\\ ] ] note that @xmath55 ( in equation  [ equation : ftferr ] ) refers to a subsample on one of our 30 plates , whereas @xmath56 refers to the subsample remaining _ on the other 29 plates_. in other words , the procedure outlined in equation  [ equation : jackerr ] is to remove each of the plates in turn and to calculate the variance between each sample on the 29 remaining plates",
    ". we shall refer to this as _",
    "jackknife error_. the unweighted version of this estimate agrees well with simulations ( see the appendix of zehavi et al . 2002 ) .",
    "finally , we will measure the statistical correlation ( not to be confused with the correlation _ function _ ) between adjacent bins of @xmath57 .",
    "the statistical correlation is related to the covariance , and is essentially an estimate of how independent the bins are - whether bin @xmath58 has a tendency to take the same value as bin @xmath59 .",
    "we might expect the covariance of the correlation function to be high , as the same data points can appear in different pairs that are counted in many different bins .",
    "the statistical correlation takes the following form @xmath60 where the covariance , @xmath61 , is defined as @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are two bins at different scales , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 represent the mean and standard deviation over a number of realisations , @xmath67 .",
    "the correlation is @xmath68 if the bins are independent , approaches @xmath47 if an increase in bin @xmath58 leads to an increase in bin @xmath59 and approaches @xmath69 if an increase in bin @xmath58 leads to a decrease in bin @xmath59 .        /@xmath70",
    "( where the monte carlo estimate itself would lie ) .",
    "the lower panel depicts the covariance between adjacent bins determined from 100 monte carlo realisations.,width=302 ]    to test the accuracy of our correlation function estimator and the associated error , we have created 100 monte carlo simulations of the 2qz .",
    "each simulation contains the same number of ( @xmath26 , identification quality of ` 11 ' ) qsos as the 2qz and has the same angular selection function , neglecting any intrinsic qso clustering .",
    "we cross - correlate the simulated samples against apm galaxies ( for the sgc strip ) and the sdss edr ( for the ngc strip ) . for each sample , the estimates of error outlined in this section",
    "are calculated and averaged .",
    "the mean value of the cross - correlation across the 100 samples is taken and the standard deviation ( @xmath34 ) is recorded as the monte carlo error . to avoid confusion between our ` monte carlo error ' and the statistical ` standard error ' we shall refer to the monte carlo error as the ` monte carlo deviation ' .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma5 ] , we display the mean cross - correlation signal across the 100 monte carlo simulations .",
    "the agreement between the ngc and sgc results are excellent - better than 12  per  cent of the monte carlo deviation on the ngc mean over all scales .",
    "the deviation of the combined result from zero , the expected result , is similarly no more than 12  per  cent of the combined monte carlo deviation over all scales .",
    "we note that the shot noise ( i.e. the standard error ) would comprise 10  per  cent of the monte carlo deviation ( as we have 100 samples ) .",
    "although the correlation function diverges on scales smaller than 0.3  arcmin , the error is sufficiently large on these scales that we may consider the correlation estimator probably valid on all of the scales plotted and certainly valid on scales larger than 0.3  arcmin .",
    "note that the consistency of the correlation estimator across all scales indicates that the software we use to calculate the estimator is robust .",
    "also , note that the average monte carlo sampling of @xmath71 contains 1180 random points in the smallest bin and has a jackknife error of 0.098this means that the typical fluctuation in our random catalog is three - and - a - half times smaller than our quoted error , and is dwarfed by the jackknife error , justifying our choice of @xmath46 in equation  [ equation : corrfunc5 ] .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma5 ] we compare the various error estimates .",
    "the general trend of the errors is in good agreement , although the poisson error estimate begins to under - predict the error ( as compared to the monte carlo estimate ) on larger scales .",
    "we assume that the monte carlo deviation represents a fair estimate of the true error on the correlation function and , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmacomp5 ] , plot the various errors taken in ratio to the monte carlo deviation .",
    "it is obvious that the poisson error is an underestimate on @xmath72  arcmin scales .",
    "we have also estimated the poisson error by substituting @xmath73 for @xmath52 in equation  [ equation : poisdd ] .",
    "such a change has negligible effect , as the simulated qsos have a largely random distribution .",
    "the jackknife and field - to - field error estimates are much better than the poisson estimate and constitute reasonable estimates on scales from 0.2  arcmin to nearly a degree .",
    "the field - to - field error , however , is perhaps a 20  per  cent overestimate on larger scales , where the jackknife error remains in line with the monte carlo estimate .",
    "the jackknife error estimate has an additional advantage over the field - to - field estimate .",
    "when the number of data points on any plate approaches zero , the field - to - field estimate is ill - defined but the jackknife estimate remains accurate until the number of data points across the entire survey approaches zero .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmacomp5 ] , we also plot the correlation due to the covariance between _ adjacent _ bins .",
    "this covariance is low - almost within the 10  per  cent expected standard error .",
    "however , this covariance measure demonstrates that no correlation between adjacent bins is artificially introduced by our random catalogues - it does not guarantee that the data will show no covariance .",
    "we will quote the significance of results by estimating the correlation function and its associated error in one ` large ' bin ( usually out to 10  arcmin ) , to minimise any covariance in the data on these scales . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the estimate of the correlation function defined by equation  [ equation : corrfunc5 ] , together with the jackknife error estimate of equation  [ equation : jackerr ] as both seem fair over scales we will probe .      in fig .",

    "it is unclear exactly why the errors are slightly larger when the analysis is carried out centring on galaxies but it is likely due to small discrepancies , perhaps second - order gradients , between the random catalogues used to mimic the different angular selection functions of the qso and galaxy samples .",

    "a bright ( @xmath82 ) subsample of these extended images should end up in the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( henceforth 2dfgrs ) and thus appear in deficit in the 2qz .",
    "it turns out that this affects separations between galaxies and qsos on scales of about 8  arcsec @xcite , smaller than the scales we are probing .",
    "restrictions on the placement of 2df fibres means the minimum angle between objects in a 2qz field is about 30  arcsec , which might mean a paucity of objects at small separations .",
    "however , this restriction should not include qso - galaxy separations as , although the 2qz was carried out simultaneously with the 2dfgrs , qso observations were given a higher observational priority , so we would expect few qsos to be rejected because of their proximity to galaxies .",
    "additionally , the vast majority of fields in the 2df survey were repeatedly observed to circumvent fibre - allocation problems .",
    "myers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that a 30  arcsec restriction on the minimum angle between 2df objects in any field leaves no significant signature on these scales .",
    "the easiest way to judge measurement systematics in the 2qz is to consider a control sample of objects that underwent identical data reduction as the qsos but should display no cosmological signatures .",

    "dust around galaxies will cause an absorption ( which we calculate from our measured colour excesses ) that will alter the magnitude limit of the qso number counts close to galaxies @xmath91 where @xmath28 is the integrated number counts , @xmath86 is the absorption in the @xmath37 band and the subscripts ` gal ' and ` field ' represent values near to galaxies and in the field , respectively .",

    "schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) base their absorption laws , from which our absorption estimates are derived , on the difference in reddening between local , lightly - reddened standard stars and more distant reddened stars in the milky way @xcite .",

    "demonstrate that their dust laws reproduce the reddening ( as compared to the mgii index ) of a sample of @xmath92 elliptical galaxies that have broad sky coverage . however , by design , the absorption law used by schlegel et al . only applies to our galaxy .",

    "in fact , though the magellanic clouds have been shown to have similar absorption laws to the milky way @xcite , other local ( @xmath93 ) galaxies have been shown to have ` greyer ' absorption laws @xcite , meaning that more dust absorption ( approximately 25  per  cent in the @xmath37 band ) is expected for the same reddening . at the @xmath1 level",
    ", none of these alternative dust laws could provide enough absorption to explain the observed qso - galaxy anti - correlation .",
    "it is possible to construct dust models that would reconcile the lack of reddening of the qso sample near galaxies with a paucity of qsos around galaxies .",
    "for instance , the uvx qso selection of the 2qz means that qsos that were excessively reddened may be lost entirely from the 2qz , especially if the measured colours of 2qz qsos exhibit a large scatter around their intrinsic colours ( which they do nt , at least at @xmath94 - see croom et al .",
    "also , if there was a lot of dust close to some galaxies , which completely obscured qsos without reddening them , then the clustering of galaxies alone might lead to the observed galaxy - qso anti - correlation .",
    "however , though various dust models can be constructed to explain a galaxy - qso anti - correlation , it is very difficult to reconcile any dust model with the positive qso - galaxy correlations seen in other samples @xcite .    acknowledging the provisos outlined above ,",
    "we tentatively proceed assuming that dust around galaxies can not account for the anti - correlation between qsos and galaxies  but can we find definitive evidence that gravitational lensing is responsible ?",
    "perhaps the key prediction of magnification bias is that an enhancement of qsos is expected near foreground lenses when the slope of the qso number - magnitude counts is greater than 0.4 and a deficit of qsos around the same lenses when the slope is less than 0.4 .",

    "when combined with the work of gaztaaga ( 2003 ) , a consistent picture emerges that spans faint and bright qso samples , which , due to the changing qso number - magnitude count slope , have very different clustering properties , relative to the foreground galaxy population .",
    "we have also considered a number of other possible explanations for the anti - correlation between qsos and galaxies .",
    "firstly , errors and the correlation estimator were proven robust against monte carlo simulations .",
    "care was taken to demonstrate that there is no significant correlation ( 0.5@xmath66 positive correlation ) between stars ( which were selected within the 2df survey in the same way as the qso sample ) and our galaxy samples .",
    "we are thus confident that the anti - correlation between qsos and galaxies is not a systematic error .",
    "the colours of qsos around galaxies were used to place limits on the effect dust ( modelled with an absorption law appropriate to the milky way ) could have in producing an anti - correlation of qsos with galaxies . whilst our simple dust models could account for at most a third of the observed anti - correlation signal ( at 2@xmath66 significance ) , we do not rule out the possibility that scatter in qso colours might preferentially discard reddened qsos from the 2qz , nor do we specifically rule out dust models that could obscure qsos without reddening them , such as grey dust , or heavy concentrations of dust in some galaxies .",
    "no dust model , however , could easily explain the positive galaxy - qso correlations found by gaztaaga ( 2003 ) .",
    "we find that , for a cosmology , galaxies are highly anti - biased on small scales .",
    "we consider two models that use quite different descriptions of the lensing matter and find they yield consistent predictions for the strength of galaxy bias on @xmath3 scales of @xmath4 .",
    "the inferred strength of this result is in agreement with the work of gaztaaga ( 2003 ) .",
    "the slope of the scale - dependent bias parameter is found to be @xmath198 .",
    "the fact that many other authors determine much higher values of @xmath7 on megaparsec scales @xcite suggests that bias might be a strong function of scale .    to explain such strong scale - dependence of bias , we can consider halo occupation models of the galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "such models predict some level of anti - bias on @xmath3 scales , typically yielding a value of @xmath202 @xcite .",
    "however , these models are complicated and depend strongly on galaxy type , and are thus not well constrained on the scales probed .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to reconcile them with the observations reported here through a better understanding of how galaxies populate haloes .",
    "an alternative interpretation of these results is that they indicate that there is significantly more mass present , at least on the @xmath6 scales probed , than predicted by .",
    "myers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) recently detected a strong anti - correlation between the same faint 2qz qsos and groups of galaxies . by applying models of gravitational lensing by simple haloes they used this anti - correlation signal to determine the mass of these lensing galaxy groups , concluding that the observed anti - correlation favours considerably more mass in groups of galaxies than accounted for in a universe with density parameter @xmath9 .",
    "it is hard to account for the statistical lensing properties either of the galaxies presented here , or the groups of galaxies from myers et al .",
