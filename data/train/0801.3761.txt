    "magnetic flux quantization in superconductors is used , in particular , for realization of very sensitive magnetometers .",
    "one of them is so - called radio - frequency ( rf ) squid @xcite .",
    "the sensor of rf squids is a single junction interferometer - a josephson junction which is incorporated in a superconducting ring with a sufficiently small inductance @xmath0 .",
    "when an external flux @xmath1 is applied to an interferometer loop , the circulating supercurrent @xmath2 is induced and a flux @xmath3 is admitted into the ring : @xmath4 the phase difference @xmath5 across a josephson junction equals to a normalized magnetic flux in the interferometer loop : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the flux quantum , and @xmath8 is an integer .",
    "since the josephson current is related to the phase difference @xmath5 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the critical current , eq .",
    "[ eq : int ] can be rewritten : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the normalized external flux and the constant @xmath13 is the normalized inductance of the interferometer .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : phi1 ] it is clearly seen that the magnetic properties of a single junction interferometer are defined by parameter @xmath14 . if @xmath15 the @xmath16 dependence is unique ( see fig .",
    "1 ) and corresponding mode of squid operation is so - called nonhysteretic . if @xmath17 the @xmath16 dependence is multivalued ( see fig .  1 ) and corresponding mode of squid operation is hysteretic .",
    "a rf squid basically consists of a sensor ( usually a single junction interferometer ) inductively coupled to a radio - frequency - biased tank circuit . the flux @xmath18 applied to the sensor changes the effective inductance ( or / and the effective resistance ) of the tank - sensor arrangement .",
    "thus , a flux change can be detected as changes in phase ( or / and amplitude ) of the voltage across the tank circuit .",
    "the classical mode for the single junction interferometer as well as for corresponding rf squid in the presence of fluctuations have been investigated in detail theoretically as well as experimentally [ 2 - 7 ] . on the other hand",
    "the quantum mode for this device is difficult to realize .",
    "since an interferometer should be hysteretic , it requires the finite @xmath19 product , and therefore , the finite coupling with environment . in order to avoid this problem ,",
    "a substitution of the geometrical inductance to the josephson one has been proposed . indeed , if the number of josephson junctions in the loop @xmath20 and for suitable junctions parameters , a double degenerated state exists at any geometrical inductance @xmath0 .",
    "one of the simplest realizations here is a three- junction interferometer , which is called also a persistent current ( or flux ) qubit @xcite .",
    "such qubit was fabricated by several teams and quantum regime was convincingly demonstrated .",
    "if external magnetic flux is @xmath21 the hysteretic interferometer exhibits double - degenerated energy states , see fig .",
    "these states correspond to the different directions of the interferometer current . if temperature is low enough and for suitable parameters of josephson junctions the magnetic flux can tunnel between the two potential minima .",
    "below we will call the systems under consideration quantum if in their dynamics there is quantum tunneling . if , for some reasons , the quantum tunneling is suppressed , we will call these systems classical ones .",
    "it is clear that the presence of the quantum tunneling ensures the absence of the hysteresis at the @xmath16 dependence . on the other hand jumps between two energy minima",
    "can be originated by the fluctuations and the hysteresis will be washed out . therefore for both cases considered above the mode of the rf squid operation will be nonhysteretic .",
    "it arises a natural question : by analyzing a squid output signal is it possible to distinguish between quantum mode ( interferometer with `` quantum leak '' ) and classical mode ( interferometer in presence of the fluctuations ) ?",
    "we address this paper to that question .",
    "the studied system presents the superconducting circuit ( ring ) with three josephson junctions , see fig .  2 .",
    "we consider the case of small self inductance of the ring @xmath22 , therefore @xmath23 .",
    "the phases across each junction in the qubit loop @xmath24 satisfy to    @xmath25    in the frame of rsj model for josephson junctions the current through each junction is :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the plank constant , @xmath28 is the electron charge , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the junctions capacitances and resistances respectively .",
    "we restrict ourself to a practical case , when two junctions in the loop are identical : @xmath31 and the third junction has slightly smaller critical current ( with the same critical current density ) @xmath32 and therefore @xmath33 .",
    "the presence of the white noise is given by the fluctuation currents @xmath34 with correlator @xmath35 and mean value @xmath36 .",
    "in dimensionless units : @xmath37 and for negligible capacitance , eq .  [ eq : rsj ] can be rewritten : @xmath38 the correlators of @xmath39 are : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 .    by introducing the phases @xmath43 and @xmath44    @xmath45    and taking into account that @xmath46 , eqs .",
    "[ eq : rsj ] can be presented in the form :    @xmath47    these equations can be reduced to : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the effective potential and the random forces are : @xmath50    the langevin equations ( 11),(12 ) describe the random motion of the particle with coordinates ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) in the periodic potential ( 13 ) , which is a set of bistable cells ( eight - shaped contours in fig .",
    "we have numerically integrated these stochastic equations by ito s method ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) for different values of parameter @xmath51 and the strength of the fluctuations @xmath52 .",
    "the typical traces of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are shown in fig .",
    "they correspond to random motion in bistable potential , fig .",
    "the arrows indicate the switching from one unit cell in fig .",
    "3a to another .",
    "with knowledge of @xmath53 and @xmath54 the average circulating current in the ring is obtained as : @xmath55    the averaging @xmath56 includes for each value of flux @xmath57 the average over time of traces ( @xmath58 ) and the average over set of 50 traces .",
    "the calculated in such way the current - flux curves for different values of @xmath52 and different values of parameter @xmath51 are presented in fig .  5 and fig .",
    "6 .    from eqs .",
    "( 11 - 13 ) the fokker - plank equation for distribution function @xmath59 can be reconstructed : @xmath60    the fokker - plank equation ( 15 ) admits the stationary potential solution ( see @xcite ) in the special case @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e. _ when all three junctions are identical . for @xmath61",
    "the analytical solution reads : @xmath62 @xmath63    since the potential @xmath64 is @xmath65 periodical function of variables @xmath44 and @xmath43 the average current in the ring is : @xmath66    in fig .",
    "7 we compare the numerical results ( circles ) and the @xmath67 obtained from the analitical formula ( 18 ) ( solid line ) for the case @xmath61 and @xmath68 .",
    "this comparison was used as an additional calibration of our numerical procedure , which is working at arbitrary values of @xmath51 .",
    "as we wrote in introduction we probe a qubit with making use of a tank circuit by the impedance measurement technique @xcite .",
    "it was convincingly shown @xcite that the observable phase difference @xmath69 between tank current @xmath70 and tank voltage @xmath71 both in classical and quantum modes reads :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is _ const _ , which characterizes the inductive coupling of the qubit with the tank circuit . by using the results of section 2 we calculated output signal @xmath69 for classical noise affected mode . for different levels of noise @xmath52 ( all of those correspond to nonhysteretic regime ) the dependencies @xmath69",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "8 .    in the quantum noise free mode",
    "( see appendix a ) the nonhysteretic behavior is achieved by the tunneling between two wells .",
    "the phase shift @xmath69 in this case is described by eqs .",
    "( 19,22 ) .",
    "it is presented in fig .",
    "8 for the same as in the classical case value of the qubit - tank coupling constant @xmath73 and experimentally realized qubit s parameters @xmath74 .",
    "comparing classical and quantum modes ( figs .",
    "8,9 ) we have found that in quantum mode the dip on the @xmath69 dependence remains constant at wide temperature range @xmath75 .",
    "this reflects the fact that tunneling splitting @xmath76 does not depend on the temperature .",
    "the depth of the dip is changed with temperature - excitations to the upper level depress the value of the average qubit s current . for classical mode",
    "the situation is rather different .",
    "first of all for reasonable set of qubit parameters it is impossible to get such narrow and profound dip similar to obtained in quantum mode .",
    "moreover , the temperature dependence of @xmath69 dip demonstrates that its width strongly depends on @xmath77 .",
    "therefore by analyzing the temperature dependence of @xmath69 one can easily distinguish between quantum and classical modes .",
    "in conclusion we analyzed the temperature dependence of imaginary part of impedance for three - junction loop - tank circuit arrangement in quantum and classical modes .",
    "we argued that impedance for these modes have quite different temperature dependencies and , therefore , can be easily distinguished experimentally .",
    "since the tunnel splitting in flux qubit is much smaller than the difference between upper energy levels , qubits are effectively two - level quantum systems . in the two level approximation",
    "a flux qubit can be described by the pseudo - spin hamiltonian @xmath78where @xmath79 are the pauli matrices ; @xmath80 is the tunneling amplitude .",
    "the qubit bias is given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the magnitude of the qubit persistent current and @xmath83 .",
    "the stationary energy levels can be easily found from the hamiltonian ( [ eq01 ] ) : @xmath84 and the average value of the qubit current at temperature @xmath77 is : @xmath85 note , that the dependence ( 21 ) is valid within the narrow interval of @xmath86 near @xmath87 , where the potential @xmath64 ( 13 ) is bistable .",
