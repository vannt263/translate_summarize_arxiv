    "with the commissioning of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , it is now possible to test dynamical models of multiparticle production in nuclear collisions up to a center - of - mass energy ( c.m . ) per nucleon @xmath6 = 5.5 tev .",
    "charged particle densities at mid - pseudorapidity , @xmath7 , and their dependence on energy and centrality are important for understanding the mechanism of hadron production and especially the interplay of soft ( string fragmentation ) and hard ( perturbative quantum chromodynamics ) scattering contributions at an order of magnitude higher energies than were extensively studied up to now at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic / bnl ) .",
    "the rate of parton - parton and multi parton - parton scattering and soft processes are strongly correlated with the observed particle multiplicity ( related to the _ initial entropy _ and the _ initial energy density _ generated in nuclear collisions over spacetime volumes up to @xmath8 greater than in elementary @xmath3 collisions ) .    using the constraints on dynamical parameters from data at rhic energies ,",
    "there remain relatively large uncertainties ( @xmath9 a factor of two ) on predictions for charged hadron multiplicities at the lhc energies , see refs .",
    "@xcite . the first data on inclusive charged particle distributions from the lhc in pb+pb collisions are now available @xcite .",
    "recently , atlas analyzed event samples from central ( 0 - 10% ) pb+pb collisions at @xmath6 = 2.76 tev in which the transverse energy of the most energetic jet ( leading jet ) @xmath10 gev and where a recoiling jet with transverse energy @xmath11 gev could be found at azimuthal separation @xmath12 . in comparison with @xmath13 collisions , atlas observed ( within a narrow cone ) in pb+pb collisions a strong reduction of the number of recoiling jets carrying a large fraction of the maximum available jet energy @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the expected strong quenching of jets due to partonic energy loss in ultradense quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "in addition to the tomographic interest in jet quenching high @xmath15 observables , there is considerable interest on the impact of mini - jet quenching as an additional final state interaction source of the observed bulk multiplicity / entropy production .",
    "the lhc data on nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath16 ) collisions may lead to an improved theoretical understanding of ultra - dense multiparton plasma based on a quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) approach @xcite .    to isolate quark - gluon plasma signatures in heavy - ion collision data , it is imperative to work in a framework that can simultaneously account for nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath3 ) in the same energy range .",
    "in fact @xmath3 reactions can not be considered as elementary at the lhc and their study has already revealed possible interesting new physics @xcite .",
    "we utilize the hijing / bb2.0 heavy - ion generator as a phenomenological tool that can systematically relate observables in @xmath17 , and @xmath18 collisions in terms of a common framework based on a two - component picture of the dynamics involving soft longitudinal beam jets , multiple minijets , and rare hard pqcd processes .",
    "the monte carlo code inherits the phenomenological successes of the lund @xcite and dual parton model ( dpm ) @xcite string excitation and hadronization mechanisms as well as the hard processes encoded in the pythia @xcite event generator .",
    "multiple low @xmath19 transverse momentum color exchanges excite the incident baryons into longitudinal strings that fragment due to color neutralization into an array of physical hadron resonance states .",
    "hard processes are modeled as high @xmath15 kinks in the strings and hadronize via the well - tested lund scheme in @xmath20 and @xmath21 processes .",
    "the hijing model @xcite uses a variant of the string excitation lund and dpm models constrained to lower energy @xmath13 data .    in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the novel `` nuclear physics '' is due to the nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions , the possibility of multiple longitudinal flux tube overlapping leading to strong longitudinal color field ( scf ) effects refered to as color ropes or glasma .",
    "strong fields also lead to enhanced strangeness production @xcite .",
    "the effect is especially enhanced for production of baryons with multiple strange quarks as discovered first at the sps / cern @xcite .",
    "recently , the data on the production of strange particles with one , two or more strange quarks for @xmath22 collisions at the tevatron @xcite and for @xmath3 collisions at the lhc @xcite have been reported . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the ratio @xmath23 and @xmath24 rise at low @xmath15 and the ratio reaches an unexpected plateau at @xmath25 gev/_c _ , which persist up to rather large 10 gev/_c_. this result is a major motivation for the present work .",
    "we address these and other issues within the framework of the hijing / bb v2.0 model @xcite . a systematic comparison with data on @xmath3 and @xmath22 collisions in a wide energy range @xcite revealed that minijet production and fragmentation as implemented in the hijing / bb v2.0 model provide a simultaneous and consistent explanation of several effects : the inclusive spectra at moderate transverse momentum ( @xmath26 gev / c ) , the energy dependence of the central rapidity density , the ( strange)baryon - meson ratios and the baryon - antibaryon asymmetry .",
    "specifically , in this paper we extend our studies to the dynamic consequences of initial and final state saturation phenomena , gluonic jj loops , and jet quenching to particle production in central ( 0 - 5% ) pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "our study aims to investigate a set of observables sensitive to the dynamics of the collisions , covering both longitudinal and transverse degree of freedom .",
    "we present here the pseudorapidity multiplicity density per participant pair , and their centrality and energy dependence .",
    "our study reveals a possible violation at @xmath6 = 2.76 tev of the _ limiting fragmentation _ observed in multiparticle production of charged particles up to top rhic energy @xcite .",
    "predictions for the nuclear modification factors ( nmf ) of charged particle ( @xmath27 ) and of identified particles ( @xmath28 ) are also discussed .",
    "we emphasize the role of scf effects and gluonic jj loops in understanding the _ meson / baryon anomaly _ at the lhc energy , which manifest in the ( strange)baryon - meson ratios at intermediate and large transverse momenta and in nmf of identified particles ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "a detailed description of the model can be found in refs .",
    "the hijing model is based on a two component geometrical model of minijet production and soft interaction and has incorporated nuclear effects such as _ shadowing _ ( nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions ) and _ jet quenching _ , via final state jet medium interaction . in the hijing / bb v2.0 model",
    "@xcite we introduce new dynamical effects associated with long - range coherent fields ( i.e. , strong longitudinal color fields , scfs ) , including baryon junctions and loops @xcite .",
    "saturation physics is based on the observation that small-_x _ hadronic and nuclear wave functions , and thus the scattering cross sections as well , are described by the same internal momentum scale known as the _ saturation scale _ ( @xmath29 ) @xcite . a recent analysis of @xmath13 data up to lhc 7 tev @xcite has shown that , with the @xmath30 factorized gluon fusion approximation the growth of the @xmath31 can be accounted for if the saturation scale grows with center - of - mass system ( c.m.s . ) energy as @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "the saturation scale is also increasing with atomic number as @xmath34 @xcite and it was argued that the effective string tension ( @xmath35 ) of color ropes should scale with @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "however , in hijing the string / rope fragmentation is the only soft source of multiparticle production and multiple minijets provide a semi - hard additional source that is computable within collinear factorized standard pqcd with initial and final radiation ( dglap evolution @xcite ) . in order to achieve a quantitative description , within our hijing / bb framework",
    "we will show that combined effects of hard and soft sources of multiparticle production can reproduce the available data in the range @xmath37 tev only with a reduced dependence of the effective string tension on @xmath38 .",
    "we find that the data can be well reproduced taking @xmath39 where @xmath40 = 1 gev / fm is the vacuum string tension value , @xmath41 = 1 gev@xmath42 is a scale factor , and @xmath43 is adjusted to give @xmath44 gev / fm at the rhic energy @xmath45 tev .",
    "our phenomenological @xmath46 is compared to @xmath47 in fig . 1 from ref.@xcite , where @xmath35 = 1.40 gev / fm at @xmath38 = 0.017 tev increases to @xmath35 = 3.14 gev / fm at @xmath38 = 14 tev .    in a strong longitudinal color electric field ,",
    "the heavier flavor suppression factor @xmath48 varies with string tension via the well - known schwinger formula @xcite , @xmath49 for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 or @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the above formula implies a suppression of heavier quark production according to @xmath56 : @xmath55 : @xmath57 : @xmath51 : @xmath52 @xmath58 1 : 1 : 0.02 : 0.3 : 10@xmath59 for the vacuum string tension @xmath60 = 1 gev / fm .",
    "for a color rope , on the other hand , the _ average string tension _",
    "value increases due to _ in - medium _ effect . with these increase string tensions the @xmath61 flavor pair production suppression factors , @xmath48 , approach unity in @xmath18 collisions . in our model",
    "this is the main mechanism for strange meson and hyperon enhancement .",
    "this increase is quantified in our calculations at rhic and lhc energies , using a power - law expression , @xmath62 where the exponent has been fixed to provide a good description of the charged particle densities at mid - pseudorapidity ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , the measured charged multiplicity grows faster ( @xmath63 ) in nucleus - nucleus collisions than it does for protons ( @xmath64)@xcite . the energy dependence of the multiplicity is an experimental probe of possible _ x _ dependence of the saturation scale @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "also , the energy density for most central ( 0 - 5% ) collisions is larger by about a factor of 3 at lhc than the corresponding one at rhic @xcite . since the energy densities are computed from the square of the field components @xcite they are proportional with @xmath66 .",
    "these experimental facts indicate that we have to use different exponent at rhic and at lhc .",
    "the problem was also addressed in cgc models , where @xmath67 . at smaller _",
    "x _ ( corresponding to lhc energy ) @xmath68 is larger , and thus the nuclear enhancement of @xmath65 is expected to be larger than at top rhic energy @xcite .",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that charged - particle multiplicities measured in central heavy ion collisions at high energies may not directly determine the initial conditions as predicted by cgc models . in its simplest implementation it was generally assumed that there is a direct correspondence between the number of partons in the initial state and the number of particles in the final state @xcite .",
    "however , final - state nonequilibrium production mechanisms generally increase the final multiplicity .",
    "in fact , in recent hijing2.0 ( which includes modern structure functions but without scf and jj loops ) the enhancement of the multiplicity due to quenching of final minijets had to be turned off not to over predict the alice @xmath69 @xcite . in hijing / bb2.0 used here with supersaturated duke - owens parton distribution functions we find a consistent description of both @xmath3 and pb+pb multiplicity when taking into account the extra multiplicity generated by minijet quenching .    as mentioned , in hijing the string / rope fragmentation is the only _ soft source _ of multiparticle production and multiple minijets provide a semihard additional source that is computable within collinear factorized standard pqcd with initial and final radiation ( dglap evolution @xcite ) . within the hijing model , one assumes that nucleon - nucleon collisions at high energy can be divided into _ soft _ and _ hard _ processes with at least one pair of jet production with transverse momentum , @xmath70 .",
    "a cutoff ( or saturation ) scale @xmath1 in the final jet production has to be introduced below which the high density of initial interactions leads to a nonperturbative mechanisms which in the hijing framework is characterized by a finite soft parton cross section @xmath71 .",
    "the inclusive jet cross section @xmath72 at leading order ( lo ) @xcite is    @xmath73    where , @xmath74    depends on the parton - parton cross section @xmath75 and parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , @xmath76 .",
    "the summation runs over all parton species ; @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the rapidities of the scattered partons ; @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the light - cone momentum fractions carried by the initial partons .",
    "the multiplicative @xmath81 factor ( @xmath82 ) accounts for the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the leading order ( lo ) jet cross section @xcite .",
    "the parton distributions per nucleon in a nucleus ( with atomic number @xmath83 and charge number @xmath84 ) , @xmath85 , are assumed to be factorizable into parton distributions in a nucleon ( @xmath86 ) and the parton shadowing factor ( @xmath87 ) ,    @xmath88    for the shadowing factor @xmath87 we take the parametrization used in the regular hijing model @xcite .",
    "we also take into account the intrinsic transverse momentum and the transverse momentum broadening due to initial multiple scattering .",
    "a saturation in the final state , i.e. , of produced gluons , is possible , even without requirement of saturation in the initial state @xcite .",
    "the largest uncertainty in minijet cross sections is the strong dependence on the minimum transverse momentum scale cutoff , @xmath89 .",
    "it was shown that an increased value ( with c.m .",
    "energy @xmath90 ) is required by the experimental data indicating that the _ coherent interaction _ becomes important .",
    "this might be taken also as an evidence of gluon final state saturation at very small _ x _ @xcite . with the duke - owens parametrization @xcite of parton distribution functions , an energy - independent cutoff scale @xmath89 = 2 gev/_c _ and a constant soft parton cross section @xmath91 = 57 mb",
    "are found to reproduce the experimental data on the hadron central rapidity density in @xmath92 collisions @xcite .",
    "however , with a constant momentum cutoff @xmath89 = 2 gev/_c _ , the total number of minijets per unit transverse area for independent multiple jet production in central nucleus - nucleus collisions , could exceed the limit @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the overlap function of @xmath18 collisions and @xmath95 is the intrinsic transverse size of a minijet with transverse momentum @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , we consider an energy and nuclear size dependent cutoff @xmath1 , to ensure the applicability of the two - component model in the hijing model for @xmath18 collisions .",
    "the pseudorapidity distribution of charged particle in central nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic and lhc energies can well be fitted ( see sec .",
    "iiia ) if we consider a scaling law of the type @xmath96 :    @xmath97    new values for @xmath1 increase from @xmath89 = 1.5 gev/_c _ at the c.m.s .",
    "energy @xmath38 = 0.02 tev up to @xmath89 = 4.2 gev/_c _ at @xmath38 = 5.5 tev .",
    "these values obtained for central @xmath18 collisions are not expected to be valid for peripheral @xmath18 or @xmath3 collisions .",
    "these dependences are similar to those used in pqcd+saturation model from ref .",
    "the main difference is a factor of two in the constant c , @xmath98 in comparison with @xmath99 from ref .",
    "note that @xmath99 result in an overestimate of the charged particle density at lhc energies by a factor of approximately two @xcite .",
    "the above limit for incoherent minijet production should also depend on impact parameter ( b ) @xcite . in the present calculations within our model such dependence",
    "is not included .",
    "instead , in the hijing model an impact parameter dependence of the gluon shadowing is considered in the parametrization of the parton shadowing factor @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "due to shadowing effects the observed @xmath83 exponent ( @xmath100 ) is somewhat less than the number expected in the saturated scaling limit ( @xmath101 ) @xcite .",
    "the alice experiment at the lhc published first experimental data on the charged hadron multiplicity density at mid - rapidity in central ( 0 - 5% ) pb + pb collisions at @xmath6=2.76 tev @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the collaboration also confirmed the presence of jet quenching @xcite by studying @xmath102 .",
    "a measure of the jet quenching at large transverse momentum ( @xmath15 ) is given by the ratio of particle yield in @xmath18 collisions to that in @xmath3 collisions , defined by @xmath103    where , @xmath104 is the number of events and @xmath105 is the number of binary nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath106 ) collisions .",
    "these results provide stringent constraints on the theoretical uncertainties in the bulk hadron production and have important consequences on theoretical predictions for jet quenching in pb + pb collisions at lhc energies .    for a parton @xmath107",
    ", the energy loss per unit distance can be expressed as @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the radiative energy loss per scattering and @xmath110 the mean free path ( mfp ) of the inelastic scattering . for a _ quark jet _ at the top rhic energy @xmath111 gev / fm and mfp @xmath112 fm @xcite .",
    "the initial parton density is proportional to the final hadron multiplicity density .",
    "the charged particle density at mid - pseudorapidity at the lhc is a factor of 2.2 higher than that at the top rhic energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a _ quark jet _ at the lhc the energy loss ( mfp ) should increase ( decrease ) by a factor of @xmath113 and become @xmath114 gev / fm and mfp @xmath115 fm . throughout this analysis we will consider the results with two sets of parameters for hard interactions : + @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath117 ; @xmath118 gev / fm ; @xmath119 fm and + @xmath120 , i.e. , @xmath117 ; @xmath121 gev / fm ; @xmath122 fm .",
    "since there is always a coronal region with an average length of @xmath123 in the system where the produced parton jets will escape without scattering or energy loss , the suppression factor can never be infinitely small .",
