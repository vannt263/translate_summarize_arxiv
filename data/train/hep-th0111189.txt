    "the study of d - branes on compact group manifolds has taught us a lot about the classification and the dynamics of branes in curved but highly symmetric backgrounds ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "part of this analysis applies directly to relevant string backgrounds , namely to string theory in near horizon geometries of ns5 or d3 branes . in both cases , a 3-sphere , i.e.  the group manifold of su(2 ) , appears as part of the background .",
    "but there is a more important aspect of these developments that is deeply rooted in cft model building .",
    "in fact , the wzw models that are used to describe strings on group manifolds appear as the basic building blocks for all the coset and orbifold constructions of exactly solvable string backgrounds .",
    "it is therefore natural to analyze how much of the known properties of strings and branes on group manifolds descends down to less symmetric coset spaces @xmath0 .",
    "this has been initiated in a number of recent papers @xcite and it is our main subject below .",
    "brane configurations ( of so - called `` cardy type '' ) in a coset model @xmath0 can be labeled by representations @xmath2 of the lie algebra @xmath3 .",
    "let us remark that not all representations are to be admitted here and that there exist some identifications between representations that are associated with exactly the same brane configuration .",
    "these issues will be addressed in more detail in section 3 .",
    "admissible irreducible representations @xmath2 of @xmath4 correspond to elementary branes while reducible representations enter when we want to describe superpositions of the elementary branes .    in section 4 we shall construct the effective non - commutative gauge theory for such branes @xmath2 in a certain limiting regime of the coset model .",
    "these theories are obtained by some kind of dimensional reduction from the fuzzy gauge theories that control the dynamics of cardy type branes on group manifolds @xcite .",
    "they are ( constrained ) matrix models involving a yang - mills and a chern - simons like term",
    ".    a large number of solutions to these non - commutative gauge theories is constructed and interpreted as a formation of bound states in section 5 .",
    "we shall show that two brane configurations @xmath2 and @xmath5 are related by condensation if the representations one obtains by restriction to the diagonally embedded @xmath6 are equivalent , @xmath7 here , the subscript ` diag ' refers to the diagonal embedding @xmath8 of @xmath9 into @xmath3 .",
    "for the criterion to make sense , we use the identification between brane configurations and representations of @xmath3 .    in non - supersymmetric backgrounds there will be many other processes that involve tachyonic ( relevant ) fields and these lead to further relations between brane configurations . but in super - symmetric models",
    "there is a fairly good chance that the criterion above exhausts all the possibilities . in this case",
    ", our findings suggest that the conserved charges of cardy - type d - branes in a coset @xmath0 take their values in the representation ring of the denominator @xmath10 , i.e.  there is one conserved charge for each irreducible representation of @xmath10 .",
    "this also fits nicely with the structure of ramond - ramond charge lattices found in certain kazama - suzuki models @xcite . for a trivial denominator @xmath11",
    ", there appears just one irreducible representation and hence we recover the known result that cardy type branes on group manifolds carry only d0-brane charge . at present , our studies of the charge group in coset models are restricted to a limiting regime and one expects that they receive the same type of corrections that appear for group manifolds @xcite .    in the last section of this paper",
    "we shall apply our general results to branes in parafermion and minimal models . for",
    "minimal models our general results will provide a large number of new candidates for flows between boundary theories extending previous related work in conformal field theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and we shall propose a nice and very suggestive geometrical interpretation . the results on parafermions and n=2 super - conformal minimal models have been ( partly ) announced before in @xcite .",

    "finally , we discuss the low energy effective action of branes on group manifolds @xcite .",
    "wzw models for a compact simple simply connected group @xmath12 are parametrized by one discrete parameter @xmath1 which is known as the _",
    "level_. we can think of @xmath1 as controlling the volume ( or ` size ' ) of the group manifolds . from the basic group valued field @xmath13 of the model one can construct ( anti-)holomorphic currents @xmath14 taking values in the lie algebra @xmath15 . throughout this work we are interested in boundary theories in which the currents are subjected to the following boundary condition at @xmath16 @xmath17 these boundary conditions were shown in @xcite to describe branes localized along conjugacy classes of the group and they are equipped with a non - vanishing b - field .",
    "the stability of the associated super - symmetric theories was established in @xcite , at least in the large volume regime . at finite level @xmath1",
    ", they can be shown to possess a tachyon free spectrum @xcite .    the wzw - model with boundary condition ( [ eq : glue ] ) can be solved using ideas that go back to the work of cardy @xcite and runkel @xcite ( see @xcite for applications to the wzw model ) .",
    "the solution uses data from the representation theory of affine lie algebras which we shall recall briefly also to set up our notations .",

    "let us now consider the wzw - model associated with the diagonal modular invariant , @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the character of the sector @xmath34 .",
    "the choice of @xmath35 implies that the bulk fields of the boundary theories we are about to discuss are obtained as descendants of primary fields @xmath36 , one for each sector of the affine lie algebra .",

    "are obtained from the primary fields by acting with zero modes of the two commuting affine lie algebras .",
    "they correspond to ground states in the bulk theory and their conformal dimensions are @xmath40 .    following the analysis of cardy , the boundary wzw model with condition ( [ eq : glue ] ) admits as many different solutions as there are sectors @xmath25 .",
    "we will denote the boundary theories by capital letters @xmath41 .",
    "these boundary theories can be characterized by the 1-point functions of bulk fields , i.e.  by the the coupling of closed string modes to the brane . according to @xcite ,",
    "these couplings are given by the modular matrix @xmath42 as follows , @xmath43 for the solution of the model , it would have been sufficient to present the couplings for the primary fields only , but we have decided to include all the fields from the list ( [ eq : list1 ] ) . on the right hand side",
    "this gives rise to the trivial factor @xmath44 .",
    "following a procedure suggested in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the localization region of the branes can be read off from the 1-point functions ( [ eq : cscg ] ) .",
    "the results of such an analysis confirm the findings of @xcite that cardy type branes are localized along conjugacy classes @xmath45 here @xmath46 is some fixed group element which depends on the brane label @xmath47 ( see e.g.  @xcite for details ) .",
    "information on the spectrum of open string states on the branes ( [ eq : cscg ] ) is encoded in the fusion rules .",
    "more precisely , the space of open strings stretching between two branes @xmath48 and @xmath49 is contained in @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the fusion rules of @xmath52 . there is a boundary field associated with each state in this state space and one can show that the operator product expansion of any two such fields is determined by the fusing matrix @xcite ( see also @xcite )",

    "( [ const1 ] ) has the form @xmath385 where @xmath386 denotes the space of ground states in @xmath387 and we sum over all @xmath260 such that @xmath257 is a sector of the coset model .",
    "if we now require the additional invariance condition @xmath388 then the only contribution in the sum will come from @xmath389 and the invariant part of @xmath390 is one - dimensional .",
    "this means that after imposing the two constraints ( [ const1],[const2 ] ) , we are left with the space @xmath391 which is isomorphic to the state space @xmath392 of the boundary coset model . in this way we have prepared states of the coset theory from states of the product of boundary wzw models",
    "now we use the boundary operators of the wzw models to build boundary operators on the product space .",
    "these will then be shown to reduce to boundary fields of the coset theory when @xmath1 is sent to infinity .",
    "the idea is to use fields of the form @xmath393 where @xmath394 label a basis in the representation spaces @xmath395 , respectively , and the coefficients @xmath396 are chosen such that the operator is invariant under the obvious action of @xmath9 .",
    "this choice of @xmath396 guarantees that the operators respect the constraint ( [ const2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , they are not compatible with our first set of constraints ( [ const1 ] ) simply because boundary primary fields usually map ground states into a linear combination which contains also excited states . but these excitations get suppressed for large values of the level so that the operators ( [ op ] ) do respect the conditions ( [ const1 ] ) in the limiting regime and hence they become the operators of the boundary theory at @xmath397 .",
    "this means that we have reduced the computation of @xmath398 and @xmath399 order terms in our effective field theory to computations in the boundary wzw model for @xmath12 and @xmath10 .",
    "these calculations have been performed in @xcite and they provide the corresponding terms in the action ( [ pwzwact ] ) .",
    "but in the case of coset theories , we work only with a small subset of boundary fields from the wzw models which is specified by the constraints ( [ const1 ] , [ const2 ] ) .",
    "they manifest themselves in the constraints ( [ eq : genconstraint ] ) of the effective field theory .",
    "it remains to discuss the quadratic terms in our effective action .",
    "these terms can be read off from the conformal dimensions .",
    "more precisely a mode @xmath307 of the coset model contributes a quadratic term proportional to @xmath400 .",
    "but in our construction of the theory from the two wzw models , @xmath307 is accompanied by the field of weight @xmath401 for the subalgebra @xmath384 and another field with the same weight being associated with the second wzw model .",
    "this would add up to @xmath402 .",
    "our prescription to put an extra factor @xmath159 into the derivatives @xmath403 , accounts for the mismatch .",
    "this is due to the fact that the conformal weights are obtained from the quadratic casimir which changes sign under the replacement @xmath404 .",
    "hence , the extra factor @xmath212 does produce the right quadratic terms @xmath405 in the effective action .",
    "it is easy to see that it does not change the higher order terms in the constrained model .",
