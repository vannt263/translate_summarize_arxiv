    "in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at collider energies , hard and semihard processes dominant .",
    "the high energy density produced in these collisions opens the possibility of studying many interesting phenomena of strong interactions , e.g. , deconfinement phase transition and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the space time evolution of the hot matter produced in the collisions may make the final observables drastically @xcite different from those directly predicted from pqcd and glauber geometry .",
    "so it s very important to study the final state interactions in order to link the experimental observables and the pqcd predictions .",
    "the final state parton interactions can be described by the equations of motion for the quark and gluon wigner operators . under semiclassical approximation and the abelian dominance approximation , in the weak field limit",
    ", the equations of motion become a set of equations resemble the classical transport equations@xcite .",
    "this motivates the study of final state interaction by solving the boltzmann equation for quarks and gluons : @xmath5.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above equation , @xmath6 is the phase space distribution of parton type @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the scattering amplitude defined by : @xmath9    to study the final state parton interactions , we have developed zpc , which solves the boltzmann equations for partons by the cascade method . in the cascade model @xcite , two partons scatter when their closest distance is less than @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the parton parton scattering cross section ) .",
    "the scattering angle is determined by the differential parton parton scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "because cascade prescription of solving the semiclassical transport equation does nt assume any particular form of the phase space distribution , it can be used to study systems far from local thermal equilibrium and it takes into account of finite mean free path effect automatically .    in the inside outside cascade picture ,",
    "the partons come out as independent partons after the nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "these partons are taken as the initial condition for the parton cascade .",
    "the parton formation proper time usually depends on the transverse momentum of the parton @xcite . in the simplest picture ,",
    "the partons are formed on a hyperbola of constant proper time @xcite determined by the average transverse momentum .",
    "the space time evolution afterwards depends also on the scattering cross section .",
    "currently , a rough yukawa type of screening is used to regulate the parton scattering cross section .",
    "lattice gauge theory @xcite and semiclassical transport theory @xcite can give us screening mass(es ) for parton interactions for equilibrium system or system close to local thermal equilibrium .",
    "assume that the formula can be used for the far from equilibrium case as in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , we can get an estimate for the medium generated screen mass . on other hand , this provides one possible way of measuring the effective screening in the medium from the experiment .    in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "there are indications that multiparton processes other than elastic scattering may dominate @xcite . also because inelastic collisions are important for the chemical equilibrium",
    ", it is important to look at parton production and annihilation processes . besides inelastic collisions , parton statistics and hadronization",
    "may all affect the prediction in a non - negligible way .",
    "these elements will be incorporated in zpc in the future .",
    "zpc is developed in parallel with gcp by yang pang @xcite .",
    "the major difference is that zpc 1.0.1 focuses on gluon elastic scatterings , while gcp is being designed to be a more general , user friendly package .",
    "zpc 1.0.1 has the local interaction list optimization .",
    "zpc 1.0.1 is written in fortran , while gcp is written in c.    in this paper , we will discuss the physics background for the parton cascade simulations , some zpc technical points , then a detailed description of the program followed by the instructions for users .",
    "for ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions ( urhics ) at rhic energies and beyond , the gluon number is much larger than the sea quark and antiquark number , and the gluon gluon elastic cross section is much larger than the gluon - quark transition cross section @xcite .",
    "to first approximation , we consider only gluon gluon elastic scatterings .",
    "the initial conditions can be read from an external file or some ideal initial conditions can be generated within the code .",
    "the formation time of partons gives the time beyond which the radiated partons can be considered as independent partons .",
    "there are different models for the formation time .",
    "a simple model motivated by the uncertainty principle and used very often for ideal theoretical calculations is proposed by bjorken@xcite . in this model ,",
    "partons are formed on a hyperbola of constant proper time .",
    "the integrated formation probability can be written as : @xmath12 @xmath13 is inversely proportional to @xmath14 , or can be simply taken as @xmath15 .",
    "another more realistic model proposed by gyulassy , wang , and plmer @xcitehas an integrated probability : @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "the above formula interpolated between the perturbative result @xmath18 for small times and the asymptotic result which is characterized by a formation time @xmath19 .    in zpc 1.0.1 ,",
    "the ideal initial conditions are generated with a fixed formation proper time .",
    "options are available to generate formation time for parton configurations generated at @xmath20 and propagate the partons to their formation time .",
    "the gluon - gluon elastic scattering differential cross section is : @xmath21 at fixed @xmath22 , the leading divergent term is : @xmath23 since two outgoing particles are identical particles , the scattering angle goes from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . if we let the scattering angle go from @xmath24 to @xmath26 , then the @xmath27 , @xmath28 singular terms are redundant .",
    "hence , @xmath29 the singularity is regularized by a medium generated screening mass .",
    "we end up with a scattering differential cross section of the form : @xmath30 this is just the yukawa type of scattering cross section .",
    "currently , we set the total cross section to be @xmath22 independent : @xmath31 and the differential cross section changes correspondingly to : @xmath32 this is only a simplified model for the gluon - gluon scatterings . following the instructions for users , it s easy to make the cross section more realistic .",
    "when the gluon system is not far from equilibrium , perturbative calculation relates the electric screening mass @xmath33 with the phase space density @xmath34 through : @xmath35    assuming the formula can be used for nonequilibrium as well , the phase space density @xmath34 is related to the gluon invariant momentum distribution @xmath36 through : @xmath37 at collider energies , the transverse screening mass is almost the same as the longitudinal screening mass . in the ideal case",
    "that the rapidity distribution is an inverted square well and the transverse momentum distribution is an exponential , the screening mass can be estimated through : @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , which is typical for the minijet gluon system produced at rhic , we get the screen mass @xmath41 .",
    "so in the cascade calculation , the screen mass is taken as several inverse fermis .",
    "zpc 1.0.1 provides the user with a choice of several scattering prescriptions , the option to read in initial conditions or to generate some ideal initial conditions , and the space cell division optimization .",
    "because of the geometric interpretation of the scattering cross section , information travels across the distance of closest approach when a scattering happens in a time period of the fixed time step or the mean free time .",
    "this may lead to causality violation .",
    "different prescriptions may give different results @xcite .",
    "to specify the scattering scheme , we need to specify the collision frame , the collision space - time point , the ordering frame , the ordering time .",
    "the collision frame is the frame in which the collision happens .",
    "the ordering frame is the frame in which the collisions are ordered in time .",
    "it is the global frame where the observer is in .",
    "the ordering time is the time of a collision that we use for ordering the collisions .    in zpc 1.0.1",
    ", the collision frame and space time point choice is set through the first digit of the variable iord_sch which can be specified in input file zpc.ini .",
    "the second digit of iord_sch gives the ordering time .",
    "the ordering frame can be chosen by setting the variable ibst_flag .",
    "zpc 1.0.1 provides 3 different geometric configurations to do cascade .",
    "we can study 3 dimensional expansion , 1 dimensional expansion and particles in a box by setting the variable i_config .",
    "setting igen_flag gives some built - in initial conditions .",
    "for the 3-d expansion , the built - in initial condition is like the minijet gluon system generated in rhic au on au central collisions .",
    "4000 particles are uniformly distributed in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "they are generated in local thermal equilibrium with a temperature @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "at @xmath20 they are within a transverse disk of radius @xmath2 .",
    "the particles are formed with a longitudinal formation time @xmath46 .",
    "the 1 dimensional expansion built - in initial condition is different from the 3-d one in that the transverse positions of particles at their formation times are within a square with x ( y ) goes from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the particles in a box built in initial conditions give particles in thermal equilibrium with temperature @xmath49 .",
    "the particles are confined within a box with x ( y , z ) goes from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "the parton cascade is different from the hadronic cascade for relatively low energy nuclear physics in that there are much more particles to start with in one event .",
    "for example , at rhic energies , each central au on au event has around 4000 minijet gluons . to get the next collision partner for a particle after the collision , a number of n ( n is the total number of particles ) operations have to be performed .",
    "the total number of operations for one event is proportional to @xmath52 . for @xmath53 ,",
    "it s difficult to get enough statistics for detailed study of events , e.g. , correlations @xcite . to improve the speed of the parton cascade , we chose to divide the space into cells . in this manner , to update a particle s collision partner , only the particles in the same and neighboring cells need to be checked .",
    "this makes the total number of operations go down to c*n*n ( n is the average number of particles in one cell ) .",
    "cells expand with time after time size ( which is the minimum of the cell dimensions size1 , size2 , and size3 ) . but to ensure the results are exactly the same as the results without cell division , size should be larger than the interaction length . for reference , the user may want to produce the results without cell division for reference and cross check .",
    "for the 3-d expansion case , set @xmath54 ; for 1-d expansion , set @xmath55 ; for particles in a box set @xmath56 .",
    "oscar ( open standard codes and subroutines ) @xcite standard has been proposed by yang pang and passed by a group of physicists ( open standard working group ) in the field of cascade simulation of high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions to provide objective scientific criteria for cascade simulations . currently , the standard output ( oscar1997a ) has a file - header and an event - header .",
    "the file - header contains general code and simulation information and the event header stores particle number , particle i d , 4 momentum , mass , position and time .",
    "we can set @xmath57 from file zpc.ini to write out the standard output into the file zpc.oscar .",
    "this provides a way of reconstructing event history .",
    "to clearly analysis the program structure , several technical words must be defined in the zpc context .",
    "an _ event _ means the time evolution of a particular initial phase space distribution of particles .",
    "for one particular event , the user can test the effect of different random number sequences by running the same initial conditions with different random number sequences .",
    "the different space time evolutions with one same initial phase space distribution , different random number sequences are called different _ run_s .",
    "an _ operation _ is one of the following : the formation of a particle , the collision of a particle with cell boundary , the collision of two particles or a combination of these simple operations . _",
