    "in this paper we study properly edge - coloured complete graphs , i.e. , graphs in which edges which share a vertex have distinct colours .",
    "properly edge - coloured complete graphs are important objects because they generalize @xmath3-factorizations of complete graphs .",
    "a @xmath3-factorization of @xmath4 is a proper edge - colouring of @xmath4 with @xmath5 colours , or equivalently a decomposition of the edges of @xmath4 into perfect matchings .",
    "these factorizations were introduced by kirkman more than 150 years ago and were extensively studied in the context of combinatorial designs ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein . )    a _ rainbow _ subgraph of a properly edge - coloured complete graph is a subgraph all of whose edges have different colours .",
    "one reason to study such subgraphs arises in ramsey theory , more precisely in the canonical version of ramsey s theorem , proved by erds and rado . here",
    "the goal is to show that edge - colourings of @xmath0 , in which each colour appears only few times contain rainbow copies of certain graphs ( see , e.g. , @xcite , introduction for more details ) .",
    "another motivation comes from problems in design theory . for example",
    "a special case of the brualdi - stein conjecture about transversals in latin squares is that every @xmath3-factorization of @xmath4 has a rainbow subgraph with @xmath5 edges and maximum degree @xmath6 .",
    "a special kind of a graph with maximum degree @xmath6 is a hamiltonian path , that is , a path which goes through every vertex of @xmath7 exactly once .",
    "since properly coloured complete graphs are believed to contain large rainbow maximum degree @xmath6 subgraphs , it is natural to ask whether they have rainbow hamiltonian paths as well .",
    "this was conjectured by hahn  @xcite in 1980 .",
    "specifically he conjectured that for @xmath8 , in every colouring of @xmath0 with @xmath9 edges of every colour there is a rainbow hamiltonian path .",
    "it turns out that this conjecture is false and for @xmath10 , maamoun and meyniel  @xcite found @xmath3-factorizations of @xmath11 without a rainbow hamilton path .",
    "nevertheless , it is widely believed ( see e.g. , @xcite ) that the intuition behind hahn s conjecture is correct and that various slight weakenings of this conjecture should be true .",
    "moreover , they should hold not only for @xmath3-factorizations but in general for proper edge - colourings .",
    "hahn and thomassen  @xcite suggested that every properly edge - coloured @xmath0 , with @xmath12 edges of each colour , has a rainbow hamiltonian path .",
    "akbari , etesami , mahini and mahmoody  @xcite conjectured that every @xmath3-factorization of @xmath0 contains a hamiltonian cycle which has at least @xmath13 different colours on its edges .",
    "they also asked whether every @xmath3-factorization has a rainbow cycle of length at least @xmath13 .",
    "andersen @xcite further conjectured that every properly edge - coloured @xmath0 has a long rainbow path .",
    "every properly edge - coloured @xmath0 has a rainbow path of length @xmath13 .",
    "there have been many positive results supporting the above conjectures . by a trivial greedy argument",
    "every properly coloured @xmath0 has a rainbow path of length @xmath14 .",
    "indeed if the maximum rainbow path @xmath15 in such a complete graph has length less than @xmath16 , then an endpoint of @xmath15 must have an edge going to @xmath17 in a colour which is not present in @xmath15 ( contradicting the maximality of @xmath15 . ) akbari , etesami , mahini and mahmoody  @xcite showed that every properly coloured @xmath0 has a rainbow cycle of length @xmath18 .",

    "gebauer and mousset  @xcite , and independently chen and li  @xcite showed that every properly coloured @xmath0 has a rainbow path of length @xmath21 .",
    "but despite all these results gyrfs and mhalla  @xcite remarked that `` presently finding a rainbow path even with @xmath22 vertices is out of reach . ''    in this paper we improve on all the above mentioned results by showing that every properly edge - coloured @xmath0 has an almost spanning rainbow cycle .",

    "the constant in front of @xmath26 can be further improved and we make no attempt to optimize it .    the proof of our main theorem is based on the following result , which has an independent interest . for a graph @xmath7 and two sets @xmath27 , we use @xmath28 to denote the number of edges of @xmath7 with one vertex in @xmath29 and one vertex in @xmath30 .",

    "partition @xmath157 into two subpaths @xmath289 and @xmath290 such that @xmath289 starts with @xmath80 and has @xmath310 .",
    "let @xmath325 @xmath326 .",
    "then @xmath327 , @xmath314 and @xmath295 for all other @xmath234 satisfy the assertion of the lemma , completing the proof    having finished all the necessary preparations we are now ready to show that every properly edge - coloured @xmath0 has a nearly - spanning rainbow cycle .",
    "given a properly edge - coloured complete graph @xmath0 , we first use theorem  [ theoremrandom ] to construct its subgraph @xmath268 , satisfying the conditions of lemma [ lemmarotation ] .",
    "let @xmath328 .",
    "let @xmath268 be a subgraph obtained by choosing every colour class randomly and independently with probability @xmath329 . since @xmath330 we have that @xmath331 .",
    "therefore , we can apply theorem  [ theoremrandom ] to get that almost surely every vertex in @xmath268 has degree @xmath332 and @xmath333 for any two disjoint sets @xmath29 and @xmath30 of size @xmath274 .",
    "fix such an @xmath268 .",
    "let @xmath334 be the subgraph of @xmath0 consisting of all edges whose colours are not in @xmath335 .",
    "we have @xmath336 . applying lemma  [ lemmapathforest ] with @xmath337 and @xmath338",
    "we get a rainbow path forest @xmath45 with @xmath339 paths and @xmath340",
    ". moreover the colours of edges in @xmath341 and @xmath268 are disjoint .",
    "next , we repeatedly apply lemma  [ lemmarotation ] @xmath342 times with @xmath343 , @xmath344 , and @xmath345 . at each iteration",
    "we delete from @xmath268 all edges sharing a colour with @xmath346 or @xmath347 to get a subgraph @xmath348 .",
    "notice that after @xmath156 iterations , @xmath268 has lost at most @xmath349 colours , and so @xmath350 and for any @xmath351 with @xmath352 we have @xmath353 .",
    "this shows that we indeed can continue the process for @xmath342 steps without violating the conditions of lemma  [ lemmarotation ] . at each iteration",
    "we either increase the length of @xmath299 by @xmath354 , or we establish that latexmath:[$|p_1|\\geq    the second option must occur at some point during the @xmath342 iterations of lemma  [ lemmarotation ] .",
    "this gives a rainbow path @xmath15 of length at least @xmath356 .",
    "as was mentioned above there must still be at least @xmath357 edges of @xmath348 left between any two disjoint sets @xmath29 , @xmath30 of size @xmath274 .",
    "let @xmath126 be the set of first @xmath274 vertices and @xmath127 be the set of last @xmath274 vertices of the rainbow path @xmath15 .",
    "then there is an edge of @xmath348 between @xmath126 and @xmath127 whose colour is not on @xmath15 . adding this edge we get a rainbow cycle of length at least @xmath358 , completing the proof .",
    "versions of theorem  [ theoremrandom ] can be proved in settings other than properly coloured complete graphs .",
    "one particularly interesting variation is to look at properly coloured balanced complete bipartite graphs @xmath359 .",
    "[ bipartitetheorem ] given a proper edge - colouring of @xmath359 with bipartition classes @xmath59 and @xmath360 , let @xmath7 be a subgraph obtained by choosing every colour class randomly and independently with probability @xmath64 . then ,",
    "with high probability , all vertices in @xmath7 have degree @xmath34 and for every two subsets @xmath361 of size @xmath112 , @xmath362 .",
    "the above theorem is proved by essentially the same argument as theorem  [ theoremrandom ] .",
    "properly coloured balanced complete bipartite graphs are interesting because they generalize latin squares . indeed given any @xmath363 latin square , one can associate a proper colouring of @xmath359 with @xmath364 to it by placing a colour @xmath156 edge between @xmath365 and @xmath366 whenever the @xmath367th entry in the latin square is @xmath156 .",
    "thus theorem  [ bipartitetheorem ] implies that every latin square has a small set of symbols which exhibits a random - like behavior .",
    "it would be interesting to find the correct value of the second order term in theorem  [ theoremrainbowcycle ] .",
    "so far , the best lower bound on this is `` @xmath24 '' which comes from maamoun and meyniel s construction in  @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible that their construction is tight and `` @xmath24 '' should be the correct value .",
    "however this would likely be very hard to prove since , at present , we do not even know how to get a rainbow maximum degree @xmath6 subgraph of a properly coloured @xmath0 with @xmath368 edges ( a subgraph with @xmath369 edges can be obtained by lemma  [ lemmapathforest ] , or by a result from  @xcite . )",
    "finally it would be interesting to know what is the smallest size of the sets for which theorem  [ theoremrandom ] holds .",
    "in particular , is it true that for all @xmath370 we have @xmath371 , where @xmath7 is the graph in theorem 1.3 ? it can be shown that this is not the case if @xmath372 and @xmath373 for an appropriate absolute constant @xmath374 ( see  @xcite . )",
