    "in quantum optics , one of the most common transformations consists in the linear coupling between two modes of the electromagnetic field , as effected , for instance , by a beam splitter in bulk optics or an optical coupler in fiber optics @xcite .",
    "mathematically , it corresponds to a rotation in phase space , namely @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the annihilation operators of the two modes that are coupled , while the angle @xmath5 $ ] is a coupling parameter related to the transmittance @xmath6 of the beam splitter .",
    "the beam splitter is called balanced when @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "the transformation ( [ bs ] ) belongs to the set of gaussian unitaries as it corresponds , in the heisenberg picture , to a linear canonical transformation in the annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 , or equivalently to a quadratic hamiltonian , namely @xmath11 , see @xcite for a review on gaussian transformations . moreover , it is a passive linear operation since it conserves the total photon number , so it can be realized with a simple glass plate with a thin coating and no additional ( pump ) energy .",
    "the beam splitter is very conveniently modeled within the so - called symplectic formalism by focusing on the action of the rotation ( [ bs ] ) on the first- and second - order moments of the quadrature operators .",
    "this enables treating complex optical circuits made of beam splitters and other optical devices in a very concise way , which is sufficient for many purposes , e.g. , when the goal is to predict distributions in phase space such as wigner functions .",
    "however , if we want to make predictions about entropies or entanglement , we need to move back to state space and work with density operators .",
    "such calculations are often nontrivial despite the simplicity of the transformation in phase - space representation .",
    "for example , consider a single - photon state @xmath12 impinging on a balanced beam splitter , the other input mode being in the vacuum state @xmath13 .",
    "the two - mode output state is obtained simply by inverting transformation ( [ bs ] ) and writing the input - mode annihilation operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 as functions of the output - mode annihilation operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the input state being @xmath16 , we can write the output state as @xmath17 which is well known to be a path - entangled state of one photon , characterized by an entanglement entropy of 1  bit as measured by the reduced von neumann entropy of any output mode . however , whenever we consider higher photon - number states at the input and arbitrary transmittances , it becomes much harder to find closed formulas for the entanglement entropy .    as another example",
    "illustrating the difficulty of treating a beam splitter in state space , let us consider an arbitrary input state in mode @xmath3 that is coupled to a thermal field in mode @xmath4 .",
    "the transformation @xmath18 can be viewed as a thermal bosonic channel , which is a special case of a gaussian phase - insensitive bosonic channel @xcite . in order to derive the channel capacity ,",
    "a crucial element is to determine the input state in mode @xmath3 that results in the minimum - entropy output state in mode @xmath14 .",
    "although it is very tempting to assume that this extremal input state is the vacuum state @xmath13 , this has not been proven to date @xcite .",
    "it is linked to the holevo - werner conjecture , which states that gaussian mixtures of gaussian states achieve the capacity of such gaussian channels @xcite .    in this paper , we exploit majorization theory in order to study the entanglement generated by an optical beam splitter .",
    "majorization provides a partial order relation between bipartite pure quantum states and gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a deterministic locc ( local operation and classical communication ) transformation from one state to another @xcite . here",
    ", we will show that a beam splitter obeys two classes of majorization relations , which bear some similarity to those characterizing another optical component , namely a two - mode squeezer @xcite .",
    "specifically , we will prove that when feeding the input mode of a beam splitter with @xmath0 photons while the other input mode is in the vacuum state , the resulting two - mode output state majorizes the state corresponding to any larger photon number @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that any bipartite entanglement measure on the output modes increases with @xmath0 in a monotonic fashion .",
    "then , we examine majorization relations with respect to the coupling parameter @xmath19 ( or , equivalently , the transmittance @xmath20 ) of the beam splitter . for a fixed photon - number input state @xmath21 in one port and vacuum in the other port",
    ", we probe the existence of majorization relations between the output states corresponding to different @xmath19 s , which we call parametric majorization .",
    "we find that in a region of finite width , the output state with parameter @xmath19 majorizes the output state with @xmath22 , which implies that entanglement can only increase with the coupling between the two modes in this region .",
    "interestingly , we also disproof parametric majorization in other regions of the parameter @xmath19 , which means that the corresponding output states are then incomparable . in some cases",
    ", however , we can prove that these incomparable output states can be catalyzed @xcite , that is , if we supplement both states with an appropriate catalyst state , then the two product states become comparable ( one is majorized by the other ) . remarkably , the catalyst state can be as simple as a path - entangled single - photon state or a two - mode vacuum squeezed state .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . after summarizing the basics of majorization theory in section",
    "ii , we exploit it in section iii and prove that the input state @xmath23 yields an output state @xmath24 that majorizes the output state @xmath25 with @xmath1 .",
    "then , in section iv , we proceed to investigate parametric majorization , namely the relation between the output states @xmath26 and @xmath27 corresponding to different transmittances .",
    "we focus , in particular , on infinitesimal majorization relations , namely the case where @xmath28 is infinitesimal .",
    "we observe a default of majorization in some specific regions of parameter @xmath19 , indicating that the above states are then incomparable .",
    "we also show how majorization may be recovered by exploiting the concept of catalysis , namely by supplementing the state with an appropriate catalyst state .",
    "finally , we close with the conclusions in section v.",
    "the theory of majorization gives a means to compare two probability distributions and to conclude which of the two is more `` disordered '' or more `` random '' @xcite .",
    "consider two @xmath29-dimensional real vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we say that @xmath30 is majorized by @xmath31 , symbolized by @xmath32 , iff @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 where the down - pointing arrow on @xmath30 and @xmath31 indicates that the components are sorted in non - increasing order .",
    "equation ( [ 2 ] ) is automatically satisfied if @xmath30 and @xmath31 are vectors normalized to unity , e.g. , if they are probability distributions .",
    "majorization only provides a partial order , in the sense that if @xmath30 is _ not",
    "_ majorized by @xmath31 ( symbolized by @xmath36 ) then this does not imply that @xmath37 .",
    "when both @xmath38 and @xmath39 hold , we say that the two vectors are _",
    "incomparable_.    the definition of majorization through eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) is very handy for calculation purposes , but it does not makes it clear in what sense @xmath30 is more disordered than @xmath31 . a more intuitive definition is to say that @xmath30 is majorized by @xmath31 iff there exists a set of @xmath40dimensional permutation matrices @xmath41 and a probability distribution @xmath42 such that @xmath43 roughly speaking , the above definition says that @xmath30 is majorized by @xmath31 iff we can obtain @xmath30 by randomly permuting the components of vector @xmath31 and afterwards taking the average over all permutations .",
    "the equivalence between these two different definitions of majorization is implied by theorems 1 and 2 below .",
    "indeed , the notion of majorization is closely related to the notion of doubly stochastic matrices .",
    "a real @xmath44 matrix @xmath45 $ ] is doubly stochastic if all its entries are non - negative , and each row and each column sums up to 1 .",
    "the following theorem gives the relation between majorization and doubly stochastic matrices .",
    "+ _ theorem 1 : _",
    "@xmath32 iff there exists a doubly stochastic matrix @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .",
    "+ the set of doubly stochastic matrices of a given dimension is convex .",
    "all extremes points of this convex set are the permutation matrices @xmath41 , so any doubly stochastic matrix can be expressed as a convex combination of permutation matrices .",
    "this is expressed in the following theorem .",
    "+ _ theorem 2 : _",
    "the @xmath44 doubly stochastic matrices @xmath46 form a convex set whose extreme points are all the @xmath44 permutation matrices @xmath41 .",
    "+ the convex set of @xmath44 doubly stochastic matrices is called birkhoff s polytope .",
    "it admits @xmath48 vertices ( i.e. , the number of @xmath44 permutation matrices ) and its dimension is @xmath49 .",
    "note that if we want to express a point ( a doubly stochastic matrix ) belonging to this @xmath49-dimensional polytope as a convex combination of the extremal points , caratheodory s theorem implies that we would need @xmath50 extremal points at most .",
    "one naturally expects that majorization theory should be connected with various measures of `` disorder '' , such as entropies . indeed , since @xmath32 means that @xmath30 is more disordered that @xmath31 , any measure of disorder @xmath51 should satisfy @xmath52 for all @xmath30 and @xmath31 such that @xmath32 . a function @xmath53 obeying this property is called schur - concave .",
    "consider , for example , the shannon entropy @xmath54 or the rnyi entropy @xmath55 of order @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "( in the limit @xmath58 , the rnyi entropy converges to the shannon entropy . ) these functions can be seen to be schur - concave as a consequence of the following theorem @xcite .",
    "+ _ theorem 3 : _ @xmath32 iff @xmath59 for all concave functions @xmath60 .",
    "+ the usefulness of majorization in quantum information theory appears first if we wish to compare two density matrices instead of probability distributions . consider the density matrices @xmath61 and @xmath62 of a @xmath40level quantum system , and their respective vectors of eigenvalues @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "+ _ theorem 4 : _",
    "@xmath65 iff state @xmath61 can be obtained from state @xmath62 by applying a mixture of unitaries .",
    "+ the proof goes simply by noting that there is a unitary transformation that aligns the eigenbasis of @xmath62 with that of @xmath61 , and that each permutation of the eigenstates can by realized by a unitary transformation .",
    "the connection with quantum information theory becomes even more evident in the context of comparing pure bipartite entangled states .",
    "indeed , majorization theory gives the means to determine whether one pure bipartite state is convertible into another one using locc ( local operation and classical communication ) .",
    "consider two @xmath40level systems @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "any bipartite pure states on these systems can be written in the schmidt form @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are suitable orthonormal bases of the systems @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the reduced density matrix of system @xmath66 is @xmath71 , and similarly for @xmath67 ( the two reduced density matrices have the same eigenvalues @xmath72 ) .",

    "state @xmath73 can be converted deterministically into state @xmath74 by means of locc iff @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the vector of eigenvalues of @xmath77 and similarly for @xmath78 .",
    "+ for conciseness , we will write simply @xmath79 instead of @xmath75 in what follows . a consequence of this theorem is that @xmath79 iff @xmath80 for all measures of entanglement @xmath81 .",
    "a measure of entanglement , or entanglement monotone , is a non - negative function of the state which does not increase on average under locc and vanishes on separable states @xcite .",
    "a common example is the entropy of entanglement , @xmath82 . since , according to theorem 5 , converting @xmath83 into @xmath84 is possible when @xmath79 , this means that @xmath85 must hold for all entanglement monotones .",
    "conversely , the maximum probability of success of converting @xmath83 into @xmath84 by means of an locc protocol satisfies @xmath86 , where the minimum is taken over all entanglement monotones @xcite .",
    "since a strategy exists where @xmath87 , this implies that @xmath80 , @xmath88 .    according to theorem 5 ,",
    "if @xmath76 and @xmath78 are incomparable , then there does not exist a strategy to convert one state into the other by locc with probability 1 .",
    "remarkably , it has been shown that one may nevertheless be able to accomplish such a transformation deterministically with the use of an auxiliary entangled state , an effect called catalysis @xcite .",
    "if two states @xmath73 and @xmath74 have incomparable @xmath89 vectors , then , under certain conditions , there exists an entangled state @xmath90 that the two parties can share , called a catalyst state , such that @xmath91 is possible . the term `` catalysis ''",
    "is justified because the entangled state @xmath90 is recovered after the locc transformation .",

    "where the first two components of the probability vector switch places , it appears difficult to provide general rules for predicting the existence or absence of majorization for an arbitrary @xmath0 , and one has to treat the problem on a case - by - case basis .",
    "the situation also becomes more complicated if we take a non - infinitesimal angle @xmath130 such that the pair of angles @xmath19 and @xmath138 belong to different regions .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the incomparable states that occur when we change the parameter @xmath19 can nevertheless be made comparable through catalysis .",

    "that not all incomparable states can be catalyzed : some necessary conditions have to be respected @xcite . to solve",
    "the problem of whether catalysis is possible or not in generality is difficult due to the fact that one has to reorder the vector resulting from the tensor product of the state to be catalyzed and the catalyst state .     and @xmath207 .",
    "the catalyst is the entangled state obtained from a beam splitter with angle @xmath208 and one single - photon input state.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( -188,66)@xmath209 ( -188,15)@xmath97 ( -139,40.5)0.7 ( -131,52)@xmath210 ( -131,29)@xmath97 ( -81,40.5)0.62 ( -34,40.5)0.1 ( -115,-2)@xmath211 ( -39,-2)@xmath212 ( -93,19)@xmath213 ( -46,19)@xmath214    consider two angles @xmath19 and @xmath215 that give osc vectors @xmath140 and @xmath216 which are incomparable .",

    "this is summarized in fig .",
    "we could also use as a catalyst a two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xmath227 with squeezing parameter @xmath228 .",
    "several other numerical examples can be found and some of them , like the ones provided above , are experimentally accessible .",
    "note that , due to the additivity of the rnyi entropies , one should look for catalyzable incomparable states only in regions where all of the rniy entropies increase ( see also refs .",
    "however , in the case at hand , we have got numerical evidence that the sole behavior of the min - entropy seems to give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of catalysis .",
    "the latter property will be examined in a forthcoming work .",
    "we have found several classes of majorization relations characterizing a beam splitter , or more generally the linear coupling between a pair of bosonic modes .",
    "more formally , we have proven that the passive bogoliubov transformation of eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) fulfills some majorization relations , which enable comparing the output states corresponding to various input photon numbers @xmath0 as well as various coupling parameters @xmath19 ( or transmittances @xmath229 ) .",
    "interestingly , this behavior is reminiscent of the majorization relations that have recently been shown to prevail with an active bogoliubov transformation ( a two - mode squeezer or parametric amplifier ) @xcite .",
    "note that in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , the present analysis has no implications on the holevo - werner conjecture .",
    "indeed , we consider situations where one of the input modes is in the vacuum state , corresponding , in the language of quantum channels , to the case of a pure lossy channel . for that specific channel ,",
    "the conjecture is well known to be true @xcite since the vacuum input state results in another vacuum state at the output of the channel ( the vacuum is the extremal input state since the corresponding output entropy is minimum  it is zero ) .",
    "we have shown that for any value of the transmittance parameter @xmath19 , the output states resulting from injecting fock states @xmath21 in one port of the beam splitter and vacuum @xmath97 in the other port obey a chain of majorization relations @xmath230 , for all @xmath231 . as a consequence",
    ", the output states can only be more entangled when increasing the number of incident photons , and we have found an explicit deterministic locc transformation that maps @xmath232 onto @xmath233 .",
    "in contrast , we have found that the situation is more complicated when varying the parameter @xmath19 and keeping @xmath0 constant . in that case",
    ", we have shown that there exists a first region in the space of parameter @xmath19 where a parametric infinitesimal majoriation relation holds , by taking the limit of an infinitesimal angle @xmath28 for any @xmath231 , namely @xmath234 .",
    "this implies a monotonic increase of the entanglement of the output states when decreasing the transmittance and moving towards a balanced beam splitter .",
    "however , beyond some value of the parameter @xmath19 , we have shown the existence of a default of majorization , which occurs because the ordering of the osc vectors changes in such a way that the leading probability is replaced by another one .",
    "this majorization default holds from the left boundary of this new ordering region at least up to the local minimum of the min - entropy .",
    "moreover , by examining specific examples , we have shown that one may find more violations of majorization for non - infinitesimal angles @xmath130 within the same ordering region or between different ordering regions .",
    "finally , we have provided an example of two incomparable states , resulting from different values of @xmath19 , whose conversion can nevertheless be catalyzed with the help of an experimentally accessible state , such as a single - photon path - entangled state or a two - mode squeezed vacuum state .",
    "catalysis schemes like the one in fig .",
    "6 may potentially be used for authentication protocols based on entanglement - assisted locc @xcite .",
    "further investigations should also include a more general solution to the catalysis process in the parameter - varying case , the analysis of majorization relations in more complicated optical circuits in the spirit of @xcite , or more ambitiously the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena in a field - theoretical approach @xcite under the prism of parametric majorization , where the parameter could be the temperature of a thermal field @xcite .",
