    "percolation model is probably the simplest and best studied system that experiences ( geometrical ) phase transition of the second kind @xcite .",

    "importantly for our study , percolation model presents a transparent mechanism of the process of hierarchical aggregation ( coagulation ) .",
    "this process has been actively employed for describing the essential properties of material fracture and earthquake nucleation @xcite , starting from the pioneering works of allegre et al .",
    "@xcite and newman and knopoff @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe the evolution of percolation model in terms of an inverse cascade of hierarchical cluster aggregation .",
    "an early idea of hierarchical aggregation was introduced by newman and knopoff in the `` crack - fusion '' model for repetitive cycles of large earthquakes @xcite .",
    "their model focused on processes of small cracks fusions into successively larger ones , accommodating the influence of mainshocks and aftershocks , juvenile crack genesis from tectonic stresses , crack healing , and anelastic - creep induced time delays , plus other effects .",

    "@xcite have reinstated this line of research considering a log - binned description of hierarchical aggregation and performing numerical tests to study its scaling properties .",
    "gabrielov et al .",
    "@xcite first have employed the horton - strahler hierarchical ranking @xcite to construct an exactly solvable model of a general inverse cascade process .",
    "the horton - strahler ranks ( see sect . [ hs ] ) that came from hydrology and have been not well known in physical applications happened to be more natural than cluster masses ( sizes , areas ) in describing the aggregation process .",
    "moreover , the ranks are shown essential for formulating the analytical models @xcite .",
    "recent efforts deal with studying the aggregation dynamics and its various scalings via exactly solvable hierarchical models and extensive simulations @xcite .",
    "below we focus on the evolution of the first spanning cluster in the the classical site - percolation model , and decribe it as a consecutive hierarchical fusion of smaller clusters into larger ones .",
    "noteworthy , we are interested not in a final solution of a percolation state , but in an evolutionary path leading from the juvenile single - particle clusters to a self - similar population of clusters of arbitrary large size ( limited by the finiteness of the lattice ) , the percolation cluster included .",
    "thus we depart from the steady - state assumption of @xcite as well as from the asymptotic focus on the percolation onset typical for the classical percolation studies @xcite .",
    "specifically , we follow @xcite and represent each cluster by a time - oriented tree that reflects the history of cluster formation .",
    "the model dynamics is then described in terms of the corresponding trees using the well - developed theory of hierarchical scaling complexities @xcite .",
    "an important role is played by the the horton - strahler scheme that provides a natural ranking for the tree - based structures .",
    "another important element is the tokunaga classification that defines a special subclass of trees with self - similar branching .",
    "a large number of hierarchies observed in nature are shown to be tokunaga trees @xcite ; this is also the case for the clusters in percolation model @xcite .",
    "we use the tokunaga constraint together with classical results on percolation dynamics ( in terms of cluster masses ) to derive time - dependent scaling laws for rank distribution of clusters .",

    "the results are discussed in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "we consider the classical 2_d _ site - percolation model @xcite .",
    "the model dynamics starts with an empty @xmath0 square lattice . at each step",
    "a particle is dropped into a randomly chosen unoccupied site ; thus each site can be either occupied by one and only one particle or empty .",
    "two sites are considered _ neighbors _ if they share one side ; each site on a square lattice has four neighbors .",
    "cluster is defined as a group of occupied neighbor sites @xcite .",
    "time refers to the steps at which particles drop onto the lattice . since we do not have annihilation of particles , time is formally equivalent to the number of particles on the lattice .",
    "it is convenient to normalize time by the lattice size @xmath1 so it varies from @xmath2 at the start to @xmath3 when all sites are occupied . during the system evolution ,",
    "occupied sites start to aggregate and clusters begin to form .",
    "once a sufficient number of particles is accumulated , a percolation cluster is formed connecting the opposite sides of the lattice vertically and/or horizontally .",
    "the density @xmath4 increases monotonically from zero to its critical value @xmath5 at percolation . for",
    "an infinite lattice @xmath6 @xcite , while for a finite lattice it is smaller @xcite : @xmath7    many phenomena encountered in the percolation model mimic what we see when the phase transitions of the second kind occur .",
    "note however that these phenomena are of purely geometrical and statistical rather than physical nature .",
    "indeed , the physical percolation theory is largerly predicated in this geometrical model and there are many empirical links between them ; this is why the percolation model is said to be an example of the _ geometrical _ phase transition of the second kind , and why its nomenclature emerges from that of the physical critical phenomena .    the theoretical description of the percolation dynamics is conventionally given in terms of the cluster masses @xcite ; and most of the universal scalings ",
    "a benchmark of phase transitions of second kind ",
    "deal with parameters expressed via the mass distribution of clusters .",
    "however , if one is interested in analytical description of the aggregation process , the mass description happens to be inferior to the hierarchical rank approach @xcite .",
    "properly defined ranks not only allow one to construct exactly solvable models of aggregation , but also they are more feasible for observations in practice .",
    "in addition , they reflect the individual history of cluster formation . below",
    "we follow the hierarchical approach of gabrielov et al .",
    "@xcite to study the percolation dynamics .      each cluster in our model",
    "is represented by a tree that reflects the time - dependent formation of a cluster ( its history ) , and is a subject for quantitative analysis .",
    "specifically , each one - particle cluster is represented by a trivial tree consisting of a single node . when two clusters are merged together their trees are also merged by adding a new node ( parent ) for which they become children ( and siblings to each other . ) in our model , the coalescence of two or more clusters can only be materialized by adding to the lattice a new particle which will be a neighbor to one or more existing clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig_model1]a illustrates the four possible types of coalescence .",
    "we call @xmath8-coalescence in a situation when a newly dropped particle ( marked *",
    "n * in the figure ) is a neighbor to @xmath8 existing clusters ( gray numbered sites ) .",
    "numerical simulations on a square lattice with @xmath9 suggest the following relative frequencies @xmath10 of @xmath8-coalescences : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . figures  [ fig_model1]b , c illustrate how a tree is formed for different coalescence types .",
    "there are two basic situations : when a new particle is a neighbor to only one existing cluster , it is considered as an individual one - particle cluster that is connected to the existing one .",
    "the connecting node of the tree in this case does not correspond to a particle on the lattice ( panel b ) .",
    "when a new particle is droped in a neighbor to two , three , or four existing clusters , it is not condidered as an individual cluster .",
    "instead , it corresponds to the connecting node in the tree ( panel c ) .",
    "thus , the connecting node in a tree may or may not correspond to a lattice particle depending on the coalescence type .",
    "the branching parameter ( number of children for a given parent ) of a tree for any cluster varies between 2 and 4 .",
    "note that both 1- and 2-coalescences result in merging only two clusters ; accordingly , most of the observed coalescences ( about 95% ) involve only two clusters while coalescence of three or four clusters is extremely rare .",
    "the consecutive process of tree formation for a simple four - particle cluster is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_model2 ] .",
    "importantly , the individual evolution of a cluster is crucial in constructing the corresponding hierarchical tree . to construct the tree one needs to consider all consecutive coalescences that have formed the cluster , not only its final shape",
    "therefore , it is clear that the same tree may correspond to clusters of different shape : figure  [ fig_model3]a shows two 11-particle clusters that both correspond to the same tree shown in panel b. therefore , working with trees , we unavoidably narrow the information about the cluster population .",
    "notice however both trees capture an excessively larger amount of information than mere cluster masses . summing up",
    ", the time evolution of a cluster is neccesary and sufficient to uniquely determine the corresponding tree , while the inverse is not true .",
    "the problems of describing the set of trees that might correspond to a given cluster , and the set of clusters that correspond to a given tree is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "next , we describe the ranking of clusters , presenting a conventional alternative to the logarithmic binning of cluster masses .",
    "the appropriate ordering of trees ( clusters ) is very important for meaningful description and analysis of the model dynamics .",
    "the problem of such an ordering is not trivial since the clusters may grow and coalesce in a variety of peculiar ways .",
    "an advantageous way to solve this problem is given by the horton - strahler topological classification of ramified patterns @xcite illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_model3]b : one assigns ranks to the nodes of a tree , starting from @xmath15 at leaves ( clusters consisting of one particle . )",
    "when two or more clusters with ranks @xmath16 , @xmath17 merge together , a new cluster is formed with the rank @xcite : @xmath18 the rank of a cluster is that of the root of the corresponding tree .",
    "it is possible to consider an alternative definition of ranks : when at least two clusters with rank @xmath19 coalesce , and other coalescing clusters have a lower rank , the rank of a new cluster becomes @xmath20 .",
    "clearly , the two definition coincide when only two clusters coalesce .",
    "the results reported in this paper are independent of the particular definition , since coalescence of more than two clusters ( especially of high ranks ) is a rare event .",
    "originally introduced in geomorphology by horton @xcite and later refined by strahler @xcite , this classification is shown to be inherent in various geophysical , biological , and computational applications @xcite .",
    "in this section we derive the distribution of the average mass @xmath21 of rank @xmath19 clusters . it will be used consequently to connect various mass and rank scaling laws .",
    "first , we define the branching ratio @xmath22 for a given cluster ( tree ) as the number @xmath23 of subclusters ( nodes ) of rank @xmath24 that joined subcluster ( node ) of rank @xmath25 , averaged over subclusters ( nodes ) of rank @xmath25 @xcite : @xmath26    next we note that the mass of a rank @xmath19 cluster is the sum of two @xmath27 cluster masses that formed the cluster ( we ignore the possibility for three or more clusters to coalesce at the same step ) , plus a unit mass of a joining particle , plus the mass of all the lower - rank clusters that joined the considered cluster , hence : @xmath28 here the coefficient @xmath29 addresses the possibility for a one - particle cluster to join another cluster in two ways : via a one - particle connector ( with probability @xmath29 ) or directly ( with probability @xmath30 ) ; the clusters with @xmath31 can only join other clusters using a one - particle connector .",

    "@xcite suggest @xmath45 which exactly solves eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) .",
    "we found it quite amazing that our complimentary set of assumptions used to derive ( [ c ] ) lead to the same numerical results as analytical study @xcite and simulations of @xcite .",
    "this suggests an underlying connection between our approaches to describe the hierarchical aggregation .    the observed mass - rank distribution of clusters at percolation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mr ] ; it obeys the exponential relation @xmath46 with @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "our simulation suggest that the mass distribution within a given rank is approximately lognormal ( not shown ) with the mean given by eq .",
    "( [ mr ] ) and a rank - independent standard deviation .",
    "the relation ( [ mr ] ) is a key element in our further analysis . as we will show , the distribution of cluster ranks at percolation ( sect .",
    "[ rankdist ] ) and its finite - size corrections ( sect .",
    "[ corrections ] ) are obtained from the corresponding classical laws for masses by simple substituting the relation ( [ mr ] ) . at the same time , one of the most important results : the time dependent rank distribution can not be obtained this way and requires an additional treatment ( sect .  [ dynrankdist ] ) .    the exponential relation of eq .",
    "( [ mr ] ) happens to be valid over the entire time interval @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding dynamics of @xmath50 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_c ] : it grows with time from about 2.0 at the earliest stages to 4.2 at percolation .",
    "this growth reflects the fact that clusters become more weighty with time due to coupling with the clusters of lower ranks ( which does not change the rank but increases the mass ) .",
    "the growth is not monotonous ; it is accompanied by pronounced log - periodic oscillations which are associated with creation of new ranks .",
    "the log - periodic oscillations that accompany general power - law increase of observed parameters have been found in many systems including hierarchical models of defect development @xcite , biased diffusion on random lattices @xcite , diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) @xcite , and others .",
    "log - periodic oscillations can be naturally explained by the discrete scale invariance ( dsi ) @xcite , which occurs in a system whose observables scale only for a discrete set of values .",
    "a famous example of dsi is given by the cantor set that pocesses a discrete scale symmetry : in order to superimpose its scaled image onto the original , one has to stretch it by the discrete factors @xmath51 , @xmath52 , not a continuous set of values .",
    "the cantor set and percolation belong to systems with built - in geometrical hierarchy , leading to dsi . in our particular system , ranks take only a countable set of values .",
    "creation of new ranks necessarily disrupt the system in a discontinuous way resulting in the log - periodicity .",
    "now we return to the numerical value of parameter @xmath53 . in steady - state simulations of @xcite @xmath54 , which is reasonably close to what we observe at percolation .",
    "recall that the models of @xcite use the `` fractal correction '' @xmath55 to the cluster shape ; this correction affects the rate @xmath56 of clusters coalescence : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the total boundary size of the clusters of rank @xmath24 .",
    "the correction @xmath55 can be expressed as @xmath59 which , together with results of fig .",
    "[ fig_c ] , shows that in the percolation model @xmath55 decreases in time passing the euclidean limit @xmath60 @xcite at @xmath61 and approaching the steady - state `` fractal '' @xmath62 @xcite at @xmath63 .",
    "the interval @xmath64 observed during @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "this section is devoted to establishing various time - dependent scaling laws for clusters of a given rank .",
    "we will see that it is tipically impossible to derive such laws by applying the mass - rank relation ( [ mr ] ) to the coresponding well - known laws for cluster masses .",
    "this illustrates an original character and richness of the rank description and prompts for developing new methods of analysis .",
    "we start with the simplest problem : rank distribution at percolation .",
    "we start recalling the well - known cluster mass distribution at percolation @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of clusters of mass @xmath69 per lattice site , and the fisher exponent @xmath70 is universal for 2_d _ systems @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_grm ] illustrates the mass distribution at percolation for a system with @xmath71 ; to smooth out statistical fluctuations it shows the number of clusters with mass equal to or larger than @xmath69 : @xmath72 .",
    "equation  ( [ grm ] ) suggests the slope @xmath73 , while the observed slope @xmath74 is somewhat less than that .",
    "this is due to the impact of two concurrent phenomena : so - called `` deviation from scaling '' at small @xmath69 @xcite and finite - size effects at large @xmath69 @xcite ; they are discussed below in sect .",

    "this index increase comparing to our @xmath82 is due to the fact that in @xcite intermediate clusters are removed from the lattice providing extra space for a larger number of smaller clusters .",
    "combining the mass - rank relation ( [ mr ] ) with ( [ nrm ] ) we obtain the following exponential rank distribution at percolation : @xmath83 with @xmath84    this is indeed what we observe in fig .",

    "the population follows a characteristic bell - shaped trajectory , with percolation at its rightward limb . as in the case of mass description",

    "here one clearly sees the similarity in the dynamics of different ranks .",
    "note that this figure is remarkably similar to fig .  7 from @xcite that shows the dynamics of clusters with logarithmically binned masses .",
    "we now proceed by establishing the appropriate time - dependent scaling laws .",

    ". however , the two exponent scaling does not work for ranks ; to show this we assume more generally @xmath99 which is consistent with the exponential rank distribution of eq.([grr ] ) at percolation ( with @xmath100 ) .",

    "the appropriate scale corrections for the mass distribution were studied by hoshen et al .",
    "@xcite and margolina et al .",
    "@xcite .    to study the above phenomena",
    "it is convenient to consider the normalized functions @xmath133 which , in the absence of scale corrections , would become constants : @xmath134 the function @xmath135 is shown in fig .  [ fig_nr]a ; it clearly deviates from the horizontal plateau at both sides .    in case of the mass distribution ,",
    "the corrections to scaling are given by @xcite : @xmath136 where @xmath137 , @xmath138 is the universal mean cluster radius exponent , and @xmath139 are independent of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the first additional term describes the deviation from scaling for small clusters , while the second one is responsible for finite - size effects .    for rank distribution , the `` deviations from scaling '' at lower clusters",
    "are only observed for @xmath15 ; while the finite - size effects at large clusters are clearly present for many ranks .",
    "accordingly , we propose the following correction to scaling for the rank distribution : @xmath142 with @xmath143 the observed value of @xmath144 can be estimated by plotting @xmath145 as a function of @xmath19 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nr]b .",
    "the observed ranks @xmath146 follow the predicted scaling ( [ grrc ] ) nicely .",
    "importantly , the corrections to scaling ( [ grrc ] ) act at all cluster sizes , so they can not be neglected even for the intermediate clusters , not only for the largest ones .",
    "indeed , their effect decreases with @xmath141 , but this decrease is very slow .",
    "notably , as shown by morein et al .",
    "@xcite ( their fig .",
    "5 ) even for lattices as large as @xmath147 during the process when clusters as large as 2% of the lattice size are removed , the cluster size distribution clearly exhibits the upward deviations at large ranks ( @xmath148 . ) for smaller systems these deviations become dominant and may lead to an artificial decrease of the observed slope of cluster size distribution ; this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_grm],[fig_grr ] and is also seen in the analysis of turcotte et al .",
    "@xcite ( their fig",
    ".  9 ) .",
    "since the finite size effects play an important role in shaping the observed cluster size distribution , it is worth studying their dynamics .",
    "specifically , we will be interested in transition of the cluster size distribution from the convex shape ( in semi- or bilogarithmic scale ) at @xmath149 to formation of the upward bend at percolation .    for this",
    "we introduce a measure of convexity for the rank distribution , defined as an area between @xmath150 and a chord connecting its first and last points as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mu ] ( the point @xmath15 is not considered being affected by the deviations from scaling ) : @xmath151 \\,d\\,r,\\ ] ] with @xmath152 the values of @xmath153 are positive when @xmath154 is convex in semilogarithmic scale , negative when it is concave , and vanish when it is linear .",
    "the measure @xmath155 averaged over 1,000 runs on the lattice @xmath71 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mu ] ; the bell - shaped form of @xmath153 is decorated by the logperiodic oscillations for @xmath156 explained by creation of new ranks , which temporarily increases convexity .",
    "zero level is crossed at about @xmath157 , after that the rank distribution is concave . a detailed analysis ( not shown )",
    "demonstrates that the distribution is never exactly linear ; the transition from convex to concave shape is realized through the wave - shaped form when the distribution is still convex for the lower @xmath19 , but is already concave for the higher ones .",
    "qualitatively the same picture is observed for the mass distribution @xmath158 ( in bilogarithmic scale ) .",
    "the transformation of the cluster size distribution prior to percolation is not unlike a well - known pattern `` upward bend '' first described by narkunskaya and shnirman @xcite in an early static model of defect development .",
    "later it was found in steel samples and seismicity of california @xcite , and confirmed by the dynamical modeling of failure in a hierarchical system ( so - called colliding cascade models ) @xcite .",
    "here we consider the dynamics of total and average mass of rank @xmath19 clusters : @xmath159 here @xmath160 denotes the number of clusters of rank @xmath19 and mass @xmath69 .",
    "figure  [ fig_avem ] shows @xmath85 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 for rank 5 ; the similar picture is observed for other ranks .",
    "it is tempting to use gaussian approximation for @xmath161 and predict the gaussian dynamics of @xmath162 ( as a ratio of two gaussians ) and relate their parameters .",
    "detailed analysis however demonstrates that under this approach the peak of @xmath162 for ranks @xmath163 should be observed after percolation ; while in simulations this peak is always prior to percolation ( not shown ) .",
    "note that one still might approximate @xmath161 and @xmath162 by gaussians with properly scaled parameters ; such approximations will be good for rough curve fitting , but will fail to reproduce deeper properties of cluster dynamics .",
    "this demonstrates the general limitations of gaussian approximations in the percolation problem .",
    "in this section we evaluate the fractal structure of clusters considering the mass - circumference relation @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the number of empty neighbors of a cluster of mass @xmath69 .",
    "for percolation cluster at infinite grid we have @xmath166 , which shows that the percolation cluster is a `` linear '' rather than a space - filling object @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_d]a shows the cluster masses as a function of their circumference for different ranks .",
    "it is easily seen how the linear scaling @xmath166 gradually develops as rank increases .",
    "figure  [ fig_d]b shows the index @xmath167 estimated for @xmath168 .",
    "figure  [ fig_fin ] shows the dynamics of @xmath169 prior to percolation ; noteworthy , its steady state behavior is altered by a gradual increase as @xmath170 .",
    "similar increase is observed for clusters of other ranks .    to explain the increase of @xmath167 we recall that the rate of cluster coalescence is proportional to their circumference ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for a given mass , clusters with a lower @xmath167 have larger circumference , and a higher chance to coalesce .",
    "when a sufficient number of rank @xmath19 clusters have been formed , the clusters with low @xmath167 start to coalesce leaving the high-@xmath167 clusters on the grid .",
    "another reason for the increase of @xmath167 is the finite - size effects .",
    "specifically , this is an effect of having clusters that on an infinite grid have already gained higher ranks , but on our finite lattice are still small .",
    "here we report an interesting regularity in rank dynamics that put a notable constraint on analytical modeling of percolation process .",
    "specificaly , we consider the slope between two consecutive points of the rank distribution : @xmath171 dynamics of @xmath172 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_peaks]a together with that of @xmath173 .",
    "noteworthy , the peaks of two curves ( minimum of @xmath172 and maximum of @xmath173 ) coincide .",
    "this happens to be true for all ranks : positions of corresponding peaks are shown as a function of rank in fig .",
    "[ fig_peaks]b .",
    "such perfect matching is very unlikely to be accidental .",
    "thus we conjecture that in order for @xmath154 to properly describe the time - dependent behavior of rank population , the following system of differential equations must have a solution : @xmath174    applying this constraint to the three - exponent scaling of eqs .",
    "( [ r2exp]),([r3exp]),([g0 ] ) we find @xmath175 according to ( [ sigmas ] ) , the observed value @xmath176 gives @xmath177 , which is 33% larger than the observed value @xmath178 .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the approximate character of the gaussian approximation ( [ g0 ] ) for @xmath109 .",
    "the goal of this study was to describe the evolution of percolation model in terms of consecutive aggregation of smaller clusters into larger ones using the horton - strahler hierarchical scheme .",
    "first , this contributes to a novel understanding of the percolation phenomenon as a time - dependent hierarchical inverse cascade process .",
    "second , this allows one to test the validity of the approach introduced by gabrielov et al . @xcite and further developed by morein et al .",
    "@xcite for a steady - state approximation to a general aggregation process .",
    "we considered dynamical and scaling properties of site - percolation on a 2_d _ square lattice .",
    "following @xcite we described clusters by hierarchical trees that reflect the history of cluster formation ; the horton - strahler scheme was used to rank the trees and thus the corresponding clusters .",
    "we concentrated on the development of the first percolation cluster , thus working with a system that does not exhibit the steady - state dynamics , contrary to the studies @xcite that have developed mean - field steady - state approximations to the system .    combining the results obtained in the classical percolation studies with the tokunaga constraint on the cluster branching structure we derived various rank - dependent scaling laws connecting the number @xmath85 of clusters of rank @xmath19 , their average mass @xmath21 , and the rank @xmath19 .",
    "we have compared the parameters of these laws with those predicted and observed by @xcite in steady - state aggregation models .",
    "the values of parameters are shown to be in a perfect agreement , confirming the validity of the approach used in @xcite . in absence of the steady - state behavior , we derived the time - dependent versions of the scaling laws .",
    "we reported the three - index scaling ( [ r2exp ] ) , ( [ r3exp ] ) for the number @xmath154 of clusters of a given rank , which deviates from the classical two - exponent scaling for masses .",
    "we studied in detail the transition of the system from earlier stages to the vicinity of percolation and reported several characteristic phenomena observed as @xmath170 .",
    "they include transformation of the cluster size distribution not unlike that observed in seismicity , steel samples , and previous models of hierarchical fractures @xcite ; and increase of the cluster fractal dimension . in our simple model these phenomena are partly explained ( qualitatively as well as quantitatively ) by finite - size effects ; nevertheless we believe that they should not be neglected as irrelevant side - effects of numerical simulation .",
    "in fact , in practice we often work with systems that are described by intermediate depth hierarchies ( in other words they have intermediate number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the percolation results related to small and intermediate lattices might be of high relevance in describing such systems .",
    "in addition , simulations on large lattices ( @xmath147 ) performed by morein et al .",
    "@xcite show that finite - size effects are still present even for large @xmath141 .",
    "we have formulated an empirical constraint of eq .",

    "the index of the mass distribution is an essential characteristic of a system , thus even this slight difference of 2.5% might seem disappointing implying the intrinsically approximate character of the modeling of @xcite .",
    "in fact , this implication is not true . to validate the approach of @xcite we notice that the fisher exponent is tightly connected to the precise count of cluster particles on a site - level , hardly feasible in practice . at the same time , the studies @xcite have demonstrated that when we `` characterize the size distribution of clusters in a way that circumvents the site - level description '' considering any `` macroscopic measure of the length scale of the cluster '' , the exponent of the corresponding scaling law becomes @xmath181 , universally for all 2_d _ systems .",
    "an example of a `` macroscopic measure '' is the linear size in arbitrary direction , the radius of gyration , the diameter of the covering disk , etc .",
