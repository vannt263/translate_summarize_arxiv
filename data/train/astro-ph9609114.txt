    "since its discovery in 1966 ( giacconi et al . 1966 )",
    "cyg x-3 has remained one of the most unusual and enigmatic objects in the sky . a neutron star ",
    "wolf rayet binary system , cyg x-3 exhibits the following unusual properties : major radio flares at intervals of aproximately 18 months ( waltman et al . 1995 ) ; a 4.8 hour period making it the shortest period high mass x - ray binary ; and following a major flare , radio jets which expand at 0.35@xmath0 ( spencer et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "recently newell , garrett & spencer ( 1996 , hereafter ngs ; newell 1996 ) published vlba maps showing superluminal motion at a significantly higher magnitude than previous superluminal velocities in the galaxy .",
    "the system also displayed superluminal contraction .",
    "we consider models for this behaviour .",
    "superluminal expansion in one - sided quasars has been well documented and we use the same notation here . consider a blob of material emitted at a velocity @xmath1 at an angle @xmath2 to the line of sight ; the blob appears to travel normal to the line of sight with a velocity @xmath3 given by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 . for a given @xmath6 the angle at which the maximum superluminal effect occurs",
    "is given by @xmath7 and at this angle the apparent velocity has a maximum of @xmath8 where we have substituted @xmath9 .",
    "observations by ngs of cygnus x-3 showed that it was undergoing apparent superluminal expansion and contraction on both the major and minor axes of an ellipse .",
    "the observations include frames showing the object at intermediate size .",
    "taking @xmath10 and using the @xmath11 values quoted by ngs , we find @xmath6 and @xmath12 as reported in table 1 .",
    "using @xmath13 for @xmath11 will tend to underestimate the actual velocities .",
    "the @xmath11 values reported by ngs may also be underestimates of the superluminal velocities ( see section [ offsetcentre ] ) .",
    "we assume that the distance adopted by ngs for cyg x-3 is not seriously in error .",
    ".apparent and actual velocities along the axes of the ellipse [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this model a spherical shell will produce a circular spot with circular expansion velocities . to simulate the elliptical shape",
    "observed we postulate a shell distorted by expansion into an anisotropic dense medium .",
    "a dense medium , sufficient to decelerate the shell , is required to explain the contraction . in this model",
    "the apparent contraction is due to a rapid reduction in intensity , lowering the emission from most of the spot area below the detection threshold .",
    "the rapid reduction in intensity is due to the collapse of the doppler boosting when the expansion velocity drops .",
    "a reduction in doppler boosting of the intensity of 1/32 would require a velocity change of @xmath14 .",
    "if this occurs in @xmath15 60 minutes ( the typical time between contractions in the ngs observations ) then the retardation is @xmath15 70 km s@xmath16 and the shell pushes back the retarding medium by @xmath15 900@xmath17 .",
    "considerable energy would be transfered to the medium , presumably with detectable consequences .",
    "this hybrid model , which combines the useful features of the moving shell and the searchlight beam models ( @xmath18 4.4 and 4.5 ) best addresses the difficult questions concerning the contraction and the elliptical shape of the emitting area .",
    "the central source produces a series of expanding spherical shells , and a beam of energetic particles or photons .",
    "the beam , which is inclined to the line of sight , illuminates a patch on an expanding shell which is seen as an elliptical area of emission .",
    "as the shell expands the area expands superluminally , as set out in @xmath19 4.5 , with the minor axis expansion velocities apparently smaller than the major axis ones .",
    "doppler boosting of the intensity is not significant here because of the large angle to the line of sight .",
    "however , as the shell expands the illuminating beam intensity per unit area decreases and so the emitted radiation falls .",
    "if the intensity of the emission across the area has a flat distribution and is close to the detection threshold of the observer s equipment then as the source fades its detectable area will rapidly shrink simulating superluminal contraction .",
    "meanwhile another shell has been produced and is expanding in the wake of the first .",
    "as emission from the first shell fades , the expanding spot on this second shell becomes visible .",
    "the difference in apparent speeds for the two flares can be explained if we imagine the flares to be running into some ambient medium and imparting momentum . a graph of the distance travelled by the shell against time is shown in figure [ shellvel ] .",
    "if both shells are expanding at the same initial rate , we would observe flare 1 to travel unhindered , then run into an object that slows it down .",
    "after a time @xmath20 we would have observed it to have travelled a distance @xmath21 at an average velocity @xmath22 . during this deceleration , if the shell pushes back the ambient medium it will have allowed flare 2 to expand a greater distance before being decelerated . for the second flare",
    "the initial speed is the same , but the shell travels further , to @xmath23 before it is slowed down . on the same time - scale , @xmath20 , the average speed will have increased to @xmath24 . the maximum shell expansion speed occurs when a previous shell has pushed the braking medium out far enough so we do not see deceleration within the time scale @xmath20 .",
    "this is the true expansion velocity of the shell .",
    "( 60,250 ) ( -150,0 )    in this model a shell apparently expanding at 16@xmath0 produces a superluminal expansion of an elliptical area which then fades and appears to contract superluminally .",
    "the model accounts for the elliptical shape and the lower minor axis velocities .",
    "illumination of a subsequent shell produces the next expansion and contraction phase .",
    "this shell is expected to travel further before retardation and have a higher average speed .",
    "we have considered a number of models which attempt to explain the superluminal expansions and contractions observed in cygnus x-3 , and the observed elliptical shape .",
    "the latter two features are the most difficult to model .",
    "the two most successful models are a ) the propagating photon pattern model and b ) the model in which expanding shells of material are illuminated by an off - axis jet or beam of radiation .",
    "we would like to thank pete taylor and tim ash for useful comments during the development of the models presented here .",
