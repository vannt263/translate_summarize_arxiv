    "in fact @xmath3 is the only variable to appear in the relativistic light - front schrdinger equations predicted from ads / qcd in the limit of zero quark masses .",
    "we have shown that there exists a precise correspondence between the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current and the energy - momentum tensor of the fundamental hadronic constituents in qcd , with the corresponding transition amplitudes describing the interaction of string modes in anti - de sitter space with the external sources which propagate in the ads interior .",

    "one thus obtains a semi - classical frame - independent first approximation to the spectra and light - front wavefunctions of meson and baryon light - quark bound states , which in turn predicts the behavior of the pion and nucleon form factors .",
    "the identification of the coordinate @xmath2 in ads space with @xmath3 at fixed light - front time also provides a physical understanding of the dynamics described by ads / qcd .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of the relativistic light - front wave equations determines the off - shell dynamics of the bound states as a function of the invariant mass of the constituents .",
    "the variable @xmath151 , which appears as a parameter in the five - dimensional mass parameter @xmath520 in ads space , is identified as the kinematic orbital angular momentum @xmath55 of the constituents in 3 + 1 space at fixed light - front time .",
    "given the light - front wavefunctions , one can compute a wide range of hadron properties , including decay constants , structure functions , distribution amplitudes and hadronic form factors .",
    "the ads / qcd light - front wavefunctions also lead to a method for computing the hadronization of quark and gluon jets at the amplitude level .",
    "@xcite    the ads / qcd soft - wall model also predicts the form of the non - perturbative effective coupling @xmath521 and its @xmath494-function .",
    "@xcite the ads / qcd model can be systematically improved by using its complete orthonormal solutions to diagonalize the full qcd light - front hamiltonian  @xcite or by applying the lippmann - schwinger method in order to systematically include the qcd interaction terms .",
    "we have also reviewed some novel features of qcd , including the consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates .",
    "the distinction between static structure functions , such as the probability distributions computed from the square of the light - front wavefunctions , versus dynamical structure functions which include the effects of rescattering , has also been emphasized .",
    "we have also discussed the relevance of the light - front hamiltonian formulation of qcd to describe the coalescence of quark and gluons into hadrons .",

    "<S> light - front holography leads to a rigorous connection between hadronic amplitudes in a higher dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space and frame - independent light - front wavefunctions of hadrons in @xmath0 physical space - time , thus providing a compelling physical interpretation of the ads / cft correspondence principle and ads / qcd , a useful framework which describes the correspondence between theories in a modified ads@xmath1 background and confining field theories in physical space - time . </S>",
    "<S> to a first semiclassical approximation , where quantum loops and quark masses are not included , this approach leads to a single - variable light - front schrdinger equation which determines the eigenspectrum and the light - front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate @xmath2 in ads space is uniquely identified with a lorentz - invariant coordinate @xmath3 which measures the separation of the constituents within a hadron at equal light - front time . </S>",
    "<S> the internal structure of hadrons is explicitly introduced and the angular momentum of the constituents plays a key role . </S>",
    "<S> we give an overview of the light - front holographic approach to strongly coupled qcd . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the photon - to - meson transition form factors ( tffs ) @xmath4 for @xmath5 using light - front holographic methods . the results for the tffs for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> mesons are also presented . </S>",
    "<S> some novel features of qcd are discussed , including the consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates . a method for computing the hadronization of quark and gluon jets at the amplitude level </S>",
    "<S> is outlined . </S>"
