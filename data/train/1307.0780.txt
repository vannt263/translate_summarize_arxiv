    "<S> in this article , we study analyticity properties of ( directed ) areas of @xmath0-neighborhoods of orbits of parabolic germs . </S>",
    "<S> the article is motivated by the question of analytic classification using @xmath0-neighborhoods of orbits in the simplest formal class .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that the coefficient in front of @xmath1 term in the asymptotic expansion in @xmath0 , which we call the principal part of the area , is a sectorially analytic function in the initial point of the orbit . </S>",
    "<S> it satisfies a cohomological equation similar to the standard trivialization equation for parabolic diffeomorphisms . we give necessary and sufficient conditions on a diffeomorphism @xmath2 for the existence of globally analytic solution of this equation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we introduce new classification type for diffeomorphisms implied by this new equation and investigate the relative position of its classes with respect to the analytic classes .    </S>",
