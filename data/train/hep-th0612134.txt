    "the scalar matter field plays the role of an order parameter which outside the monopole s core acquires a non - vanishing value . the global monopole was first introduced by sokolov and starobinsky soko and the gravitational effects of the global monopole have been analyzed by barriola and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for points far away from the monopole s center the corresponding geometry can be described by the line element @xmath3with the parameter @xmath4 determined by the energy scale @xmath5 where the global symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "it is of interest to note that the effective metric produced in superfluid @xmath6 by a monopole is described by line element ( [ gm1 ] ) with the negative angle deficit , @xmath7 , which corresponds to the negative mass of the topological object @xcite .",
    "many of treatments in the investigation of physical effects around a global monopole deal mainly with the case of the idealized point - like monopole geometry described by line element ( [ gm1 ] ) for all values of the radial coordinate .",
    "however , the realistic global monopole has a characteristic core radius determined by the symmetry braking scale at which the monopole is formed .",
    "the calculation of the metric tensor in the region inside the global monopole would require the knowledge of the behavior of the energy - momentum tensor associated with the scalar field @xmath0 , which on the other hand requires the knowledge of the components of the metric tensor , providing , in this way , a non solvable integral equation @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall not go into the details of this calculation .",
    "instead , we shall consider a simplified model described by two sets of the metric tensor for two distinct regions , continuous at a spherical shell of radius @xmath8 .",

    "many years ago , linet @xcite and smith @xcite , independently , have shown that an electrically charged particle placed at rest in the spacetime of an idealized cosmic string becomes subjected to a repulsive self - interaction .",
    "this self - interaction is a consequence of the distortion of the particle s fields caused by the planar angle deficit associated with the conical geometry .",
    "also it was shown in @xcite that a linear electric or magnetic sources in the spacetime of a cosmic string parallel to the latter , become subject to induced self - interactions .",
    "more recently the problem of the induced electrostatic self - energy in the spacetime of a thick cosmic string has been considered in @xcite .",
    "analogously what happens in the cosmic string spacetime , a point - like electrically charged particle placed at rest in the spacetime of an idealized global monopole , becomes also subjected to a repulsive self - interaction @xcite . in the present paper",

    "we shall consider the induced electrostatic self - energy and self - force associated with a point - like charged particle placed at rest in the spacetime of a global monopole with a finite core described by line element ( [ gm2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding results specify the conditions under which we can ignore the details of the interior structure and approximate the effect of the global monopole by the idealized model .",
    "the analysis of quantum vacuum effects for a scalar field in the model under consideration has been developed in mello4 .",
    "it was shown that these effects are composed by the sum of a point - like monopole and core - induced parts . moreover , adopting a specific model for the monopole s core , the flower - pot one , explicit calculations for the vacuum polarization effects in the exterior and interior regions have been done .",

    "writing the maxwell equations in the spherically symmetric spacetime , in section [ sec : outside ] we calculate the three - dimensional green function for points outside and inside the monopole s core . as a consequence ,",
    "we provide a general expression for the electrostatic self - energy and the related self - force .",
    "we shall see that in the exterior region the corresponding expressions are composed by two parts .",
    "the first ones are induced by the global monopole considered as a point - like object , while the second parts are induced by the non - vanishing inner structure attributed to it . as an illustration of the general results obtained , in section [ sec : flower ]  we consider the flower - pot model for the region inside the core . in this model",
