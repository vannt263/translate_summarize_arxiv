    "the polarization has the potential to be a direct probe of the universe at an age of @xmath26  s as well as to inform us about the ionization history of the universe .",
    "this paper reports on the direct detection of cmb polarization at large angular scales and helps set a foundation for future observations .",
    "it is one of four related papers on the three - year _ wmap _  analysis : @xcite report on systematic errors and mapmaking , @xcite on the temperature anisotropy and basic results , and @xcite on the parameter estimation and cosmological significance .",
    "the polarization of the cmb was predicted soon after the discovery of the cmb @xcite . since then",
    ", considerable advances have been made on both theoretical and observational fronts .",
    "the theoretical development @xcite has evolved to where there are precise predictions and a common language to describe the polarization signal .",
    "@xcite give a pedagogical overview .",
    "the first limits on the polarization were placed by @xcite , followed by @xcite and @xcite . in 2002 ,",
    "the dasi team announced a detection of cmb polarization at sub - degree angular scales based on 9 months of data from a 13 element 30  ghz interferometer @xcite .",
    "the signal level was consistent with that expected from measurements of the temperature spectrum .",
    "the dasi results were confirmed and extended @xcite almost contemporaneously with the release of the cbi @xcite and capmap @xcite results .",
    "more recently , the boomerang team has released its measurement of cmb polarization @xcite .",
    "all of these measurements were made at small angular scales ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "of the experiments that measure the polarization , the dasi , cbi , and boomerang @xcite teams also report detections of the temperature - polarization cross correlation .",
    "the cmb polarization probes the evolution of the decoupling and reionization epochs .",
    "the polarization signal is generated by thompson scattering of a local quadrupolar radiation pattern by free electrons .",
    "the scattering of the same quadrupolar pattern in a direction perpendicular to the line of sight to the observer has the effect of isotropizing the quadrupolar radiation field .",
    "the net polarization results from a competition between these two effects .",
    "we estimate the magnitude of the signal following basko and polnarev ( 1980 ) . by integrating the boltzmann equation for the photon distribution",
    "they show that the ratio of the polarization anisotropy ( @xmath28 ) to the temperature ( @xmath29 ) signal in a flat cosmology is given by @xmath30\\sqrt{1+z'}dz'\\over        \\int_0^\\infty [ 6e^{-\\tau(z ' ) } + e^{-0.3\\tau(z')}]\\sqrt{1+z'}dz ' } , \\label{eq : ih}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the optical depth . here , @xmath32 is the thompson cross section , @xmath33 is the speed of light , and @xmath34 is the free electron density .",
    "the difference in brackets in the numerator sets the range in @xmath35 over which polarization is generated .",
    "for example , if the decoupling epoch entailed an instantaneous transition from an extremely high optical depth ( @xmath36 ) to transparency ( @xmath37 ) , there would be no polarization signal .    to estimate the polarization fraction we compute the optical depth using ordinary atomic physics and the thermal history of the universe @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in figure  1 . from inserting @xmath38 in equation  [ eq : ih ]",
    ", we find that the expected level of polarization anisotropy is @xmath39% ( in @xmath40 ) of the anisotropy .",
    "the polarization producing quadrupole is generated by different mechanisms at different epochs .",
    "near decoupling at @xmath41 @xcite , velocity gradients in the flow of the primordial plasma give rise to the quadrupole .",
    "more specifically , in the rest frame of an electron in such a flow , the radiation background has a quadrupolar pattern proportional to the velocity gradient , @xmath42 , and the mean free path between scatterings , @xmath43 . just before decoupling , @xmath44 , the photons are tightly coupled to the electrons and @xmath43 is small .",
    "thus , the polarization is small . as decoupling proceeds @xmath43 increases and the quadrupole magnitude increases .",
    "the process is cut off at lower redshift because the optical depth drops so rapidly . in the context of inflationary cosmology ,",
    "@xcite show that in fourier space the polarization signal is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the wavevector and @xmath47 is the width of the last scattering surface .",
    "after decoupling there are no free electrons to scatter the cmb until the first generation of stars ignite and reionize the universe at @xmath48 .",
    "the free electrons then scatter the intrinsic cmb quadrupole , @xmath49 , and produce a polarized signal @xmath50 . as",
    "this process occurs well after decoupling , the effects of the scattering are manifest at comparatively lower values of @xmath51 .",
    "we expect the maximum value of the signal to be at @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the current angular size of the horizon at reionization . for @xmath54",
    "a simple fit gives @xmath55 , so that for @xmath56 , @xmath57 . thus , the signature of reionization in polarization is cleanly separable from the signature of decoupling .",
    "in the first data release the _ wmap _ team published a measurement of the temperature - polarization ( te ) cross spectrum for @xmath58 @xcite with distinctive anti - peak and peak structure @xcite .",
    "the @xmath59 part of the spectrum was consistent with the prediction from the temperature power spectrum , while the @xmath11 part showed an excess that was interpreted as reionization at @xmath60 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "this paper builds on and extends these results .",
    "not only are there three times as much data , but the analysis has improved significantly : 1 ) the polarization mapmaking pipeline now self - consistently includes almost all known effects and correlations due to instrumental systematics , gain and offset drifts , unequal weighting , and masking @xcite . for example , the noise matrix is no longer taken to be diagonal in pixel space , leading to new estimates of the uncertainties .",
    "2 ) the polarization power spectrum estimate now consistently includes the temperature , e and b modes ( defined below ) , and the coupling between them ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) the polarized foreground emission is now modeled and subtracted in pixel space (  [ sec : fgr ] ) .",
    "potential residual contamination is examined @xmath51 by @xmath51 as a function of frequency .",
    "in addition to enabling the production of full sky maps of the polarization and their power spectra , the combination of these three improvements has led to a new measure of the @xmath11 te and ee spectra , and therefore a new evaluation of the optical depth based primarily on ee .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we discuss the measurement in  [ sec : inst ] and consider systematic errors and maps in  [ sec : syst ] . in  [ sec : foregrounds ] we discuss foreground emission .",

    "detection of the cmb polarization requires tight control of systematic errors , as small couplings to the temperature field or instrument will dominate the polarization signal .",
    "_ wmap _ s differential nature and interlocked scan strategy suppress potential polarization systematics in ways similar to the suppression for temperature systematics .",
    "the details are different however , and more complex because of the tensorial nature of the polarization field and the double difference required to measure the polarization . throughout our analyses , the overall level of systematic contamination",

    "offset and baseline drift- _ the instrumental offset is the output of the detector in the absence of celestial signal .",
    "the average polarization offset in the q , v , and w bands is 250  mk .",
    "changes in this offset on time scales of minutes to hours arise from spacecraft temperature changes and from @xmath100 drifts in the amplifier gain acting on the 250  mk . to measure polarization at the level of @xmath101k",
    ", we require that changes in the baseline be suppressed by roughly a factor of @xmath102 . the first step in achieving",
    "this is maintaining a stable instrument and environment .",
    "the physical temperature of the das averaged over a spin period changes by less than 5 parts in @xmath102 @xcite , suppressing changes in the baseline by a similar factor .",
    "the second step in achieving this is through the baseline removal in the mapmaking algorithm @xcite .",
    "if the precession of the satellite were stopped , the temperature data for @xmath103 would repeat in the time stream at the spin period ( 2.16  m ) .",
    "the offset , though , would change sign relative to the celestial signal at half the spin period enabling the differentiation of celestial and instrumental signals .",
    "( alternatively , one may imagine observing a planet in which case the temperature data would change sign at half the spin period and an offset would be constant . )",
    "by contrast , with our choice of polarization orientations , the polarization data @xmath104 , would repeat at half the spin period for some orientations of the satellite .",
    "consequently , an instrumental offset would not change sign relative to a celestial signal upon a @xmath105 spacecraft rotation .",
    "thus the polarization data are more sensitive to instrumental offsets than are the temperature data . in general",

    "s stability plays a key role .",
    "the residual calibration errors are at the @xmath107% level .",
    "these errors do not limit the polarization maps because the bright galactic plane is masked in the time ordered data when producing the high galactic latitude maps @xcite .",
    "the overall absolute calibration uncertainty is still the first - year value , 0.5% @xcite .",
    "_ passband mismatch _ the effective central frequencies @xcite for @xmath68 and @xmath70 are not the same .",
    "this affects both the beam patterns , treated below , and the detected flux from a celestial source , treated in the following .",
    "the passbands for the a and b sides of one polarization channel in a da may be treated as the same because the dominant contributions to the passband definition , the amplifiers and band defining filters , are common to both sides .    since _ wmap",
    "_  is calibrated on the cmb dipole , the presence of a passband mismatch means that the response to radiation with a non - thermal spectrum is different from the response to radiation with a cmb spectrum @xcite .",
    "this would be true even if the sky were unpolarized , the polarization offset zero , and the beams identical .",
    "the effect produces a response in the polarization data of the form : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the unpolarized temperature difference observed in radiometer one , and similarly for @xmath110 .",
    "if these differ due to passband differences , the polarization data will have an output component that is independent of parallactic angle .",
    "given sufficient paralactic coverage , such a term can be separated from stokes @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the mapmaking process .",
    "we model the polarized signal as @xmath111 where the constant , @xmath112 , absorbs the signal due to passband mismatch .",
    "we solve for the mismatch term simultaneously with @xmath77 and @xmath78 as outlined in @xcite .",
    "note that we do not need to know the magnitude of the passband mismatch , it is fit for in the mapmaking process .",
    "the @xmath112 map resembles a temperature map of the galaxy but at a reduced amplitude of @xmath113 in k band , 2.5% in the v1 band , and on average @xmath106% for the other bands .",
    "the maps of @xmath112 agree with the expectations based on the measured passband mismatch .    _ beamwidth mismatch _ the beamwidths of each polarization on each of the a and b sides are different .",
    "the difference between the a and b side beam shapes is due to the difference in shapes of the primary mirrors and is self consistently treated in the window function @xcite .",
    "the difference in beam shapes between @xmath68 and @xmath70 is due to the mismatch in central frequencies . and",
    "@xmath70 would be the same to @xmath114% accuracy . ]",
    "this effect is most easily seen in the k - band observations of jupiter .",
    "we denote the brightness temperature and solid angle of jupiter with @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and the measured quantities as @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "although the product @xmath119 is the same for the two polarizations ( because jupiter is almost a thermal source in k band ) , the beam solid angles differ by 8.1% on the a - side and 6.5% on the b - side @xcite .",
    "the primary effect of the beamwidth mismatch is to complicate the determination of the intrinsic polarization of point sources .",
    "the difference in beams also leads to a small difference in window functions between @xmath68 and @xmath70 .",
    "the signature would be leakage of power from the temperature anisotropy into the polarization signal at high @xmath51 .",
    "we have analyzed the data for evidence of this effect and found it to be negligible .",
    "additionally , as most of the cmb and foreground polarization signal comes from angular scales much larger than the beam , the difference in window functions can safely be ignored in this data set",
    ".    _ polarization isolation and cross polarization _ polarization isolation , @xmath120 , and cross polarization are measures of the leakage of electric field from one polarization into the measurement of the orthogonal polarization .",
    "for example , if a source were fully polarized in the vertical direction with intensity @xmath121 and was measured to have intensity @xmath122 with a horizontally polarized detector , one would say that the cross polar response ( or isolation ) is @xmath123 or @xmath124  db .",
    "the term `` polarization isolation '' is usually applied to devices whereas `` cross polarization '' is applied to the optical response of the telescope .",
    "we treat these together as a cross - polar response . for _ wmap",
    "_ , the off - axis design and imperfections in the orthomode transducers ( omt ) lead to a small cross - polar response .",

    "we consider the combination of beams plus components below .    because _ wmap _  measures only the difference in power from two polarizations , it measures only stokes @xmath77 in a reference frame fixed to the radiometers , @xmath131 .",
    "the sensitivity to celestial stokes @xmath77 and @xmath78 comes through multiple observations of a single pixel with different orientations of the satellite .",
    "the formalism that describes how cross polarization interacts with the observations is given in appendix  [ app : jones ] . to leading order",
    ", the effect of a simple cross polarization of the form @xmath132 is to rotate some of the radiometer @xmath78 into a @xmath77 component .",

    "note that in the frame of the radiometers @xmath135 ( stokes @xmath77 in the b - side coordinate system ) is @xmath138 .",
    "this leads to the difference in sign conventions between the above and equation  [ eq : diff_defs ] .",
    "system measurements limit the magnitude of @xmath139 but do not directly give the phase , @xmath140 .",
    "laboratory measurements of selected omts show @xmath141 , indicating the effective cross polar contamination is negligible .",
    "we limit the net effect of the reflectors and omt with measurements in the gemac antenna range @xcite .",
    "we find that for a linearly polarized input , the ratios of the maximum to minimum responses of the omts are 1 ) @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath125 , @xmath125 , @xmath142  db for k through w band respectively ; 2 ) @xmath143 apart ; and 3 ) within @xmath144 of the design orientation .",
    "thus , we can limit any rotation of one component into another to @xmath145 .",
    "the comparison of @xmath79 derived from tau  a  to the measurement by @xcite in table  [ tab : crab ] gives further evidence that any possible rotation of the stokes components is minimal .",

    "a change in the loss across the bandpass due to , for example , the feed horns is a potential systematic error that we do not quantify with the radiometer passband measurements @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is second order to the loss imbalance which is 1% .",

    ", one must take into account the correlations or anticorrelations between various foreground components and between the foreground components and the cmb .",

    "the choice of model makes little difference to the conclusions .",
    "for all the following we have subtracted the best fit kd3pol @xmath77 and @xmath78 templates from the ka through w maps ( both r4 and r9 versions ) as described in section  [ sec : foregrounds ] .",

    "this is demonstrated , for example , in the kka and kaka combinations for @xmath266 ee in table  [ tab : eebb ] , in the subtraction shown in figure  [ fig : inout ] , and to a lesser degree by the null eb and bb power spectra .",
    "we also note that to a good approximation foreground emission adds only in quadrature to cmb emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : lbyleebb ] shows the power spectra of the foreground cleaned maps as a function of frequency for @xmath358 .",
    "it also shows what we estimate to be the maximum levels of residual foreground contamination in the power spectrum . in the figure , we plot the synchrotron spectrum scaled to 0.15 of the pre - cleaned ka band value ( in temperature ) .",
    "this shows that there is negligible residual synchrotron from 40 to 60 ghz with the possible exception of @xmath266 at 40  ghz .",
    "given the size of the @xmath266 error bar , this potential contribution to the determination of the optical depth is negligible as discussed in section   [ sec : tau ] . constraining the residual dust contamination is more difficult . in figure",
    "[ fig : lbyleebb ] , we also show the mem temperature dust model scaled by 5% , a typical dust polarization value .",
    "a similarly scaled fds model is almost identical .",
    "this shows that even if we did not model and subtract dust , the contamination from it would not be large in q and v bands .",
    "a more detailed model might have to take into account the possibility that the electrons and dust grains are in regions at different line of sight distances with different magnetic fields or that variations in the magnetic field could alias power from low multipoles to higher ones .",
    "the cross power spectra of the cleaned maps are combined by frequency band for testing cosmological models .",
    "the 10 cross spectra ( since k - band is used in the model , there is no k - band cleaned spectrum ) are assessed @xmath51 by @xmath51 with a least squares fit to a flat line in figure  [ fig : lbyleebb ] .",

    "we present selected , though typical , results in the following .",
    "a particularly important test is the null measurement of the bb , tb , and eb signals as shown in table  [ tab : chisq ] and figure  [ fig : chisq ] .",
    "these data combinations are derived from the same processing as the ee , te , and tt combinations , where a signal is detected .",

    "[ fig : lbyleebb ] , it is clear that the large signal in w band is not residual dust contamination because the dust would not fit measurements in vw .",
    "additionally , if one assumes that the polarized emission at a particular @xmath51 is a fraction times the intensity at the same @xmath51 , it would require @xmath367% dust polarization , which is unreasonable . though this simple picture does not take into account the aliasing of intensity from a lower @xmath51",
    ", we do not observe a similar effect with the synchrotron emission , which in the simplest case is polarized by the same magnetic fields .",
    "the w - band ee @xmath362 value is essentially unchanged by cleaning , removing a @xmath368 radius around the galactic caps , or by additionally masking @xmath369 in the ecliptic plane .",
    "a number of tests have been done to identify this artifact of the data .",
    "we are not yet certain if it is due to an ersatz signal or an incorrect noise term .",
    "the error bars on the individual year differences are too large to clearly see if the effect is the same from year to year .",
    "simulations show that @xmath100 alone can not explain the signal . the scan pattern in combination with the change in polarization is directly related to the large error bars at @xmath361 and is well understood .",
    "we have not identified a mechanism that leads to a further increase in these uncertainties .",
    "we know that different treatments of the noise , for example using @xmath296 weighting , decreases the magnitude of the discrepancy , though we are confident that the @xmath304 treatment of the pixel noise is the correct approach .",
    "the discrepancy can be made smaller by eliminating the w1 data simply because the error bars increase .",
    "the w1 radiometer has the lowest noise but also the largest number of `` glitches '' .",
    "however , since we could not identify any correlation between the glitch rate ( assuming that unmasked glitches are responsible ) and the magnitude of the signal , we do not have a basis for eliminating this channel .",
    "we believe there is an as yet unknown coupling in the w - band data that is driving the signal but more simulations and more sensitivity are needed to understand it .",
    "we can not rule out similar lower - level problems in other bands , but we see no evidence of systematic effects in bb , eb , or other values of @xmath51 and other frequencies in ee . to avoid biasing the result by this residual artifact",
    "which also possibly masks some unmodeled dust and synchrotron contamination , we limit the cosmological analysis to the qv combination .",
    "we also show that including w band ee does not alter our conclusions .      a comparison of the raw spectra and foreground cleaned spectra is shown in figure  [ fig : correebb ] .",
    "we start with the weighted sum of the 8 cross spectra with @xmath370  ghz ( without kw ) .",

    "from the bottom left panel in figure  [ fig : correebb ] one sees that there is a clear signal above the noise in ee at @xmath371 . for the qv combination , @xmath372 .",
    "the signal has persisted through a number of different analyses .",
    "we can not rule out that this signal might find explanation in an unmodeled foreground component ; however , we find this explanation unlikely since the emission would have to be strikingly different from the measured spatial and frequency characteristics of the polarized foreground emission .",
    "additionally , when different bands are coadded , the signal level is consistent : for qvw @xmath373 and for all channels with @xmath374ghz except kw , @xmath375 .",
    "we have searched for systematic effects in the ee @xmath376 range and have not been able to identify any , other than the one discussed above .",
    "we can not find a more plausible explanation than that the signal is in the sky .",
    "we are thus led to interpret it cosmologically .",

    "it is clear that the noise is not yet low enough to use just qv as was done at low multipoles .",

    "when the same code is used to analyze eb and bb data , the fitted amplitude is always consistent with zero .",
    "to summarize , the _ wmap _  ee data are consistent with a model of adiabatic fluctuations based on the temperature maps at greater than the @xmath388 level for the qvw and kaqvw combinations .",
    "figure  [ fig : tespec ] ( left panel ) shows the te spectrum for @xmath11 .",
    "we use v band for temperature and the qv combination for polarization .",
    "several aspects of the new processing led to increased errors and a reduced low-@xmath51 signal estimate relative to the first - year result ( figure  8 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these include : improvements in mapmaking and power spectrum estimation ( especially accounting for correlated noise and applying @xmath304 weighting ) ; limiting the bands to just q and v instead of ka - w ; increasing the cut from kp0 to p06 ; and improvements in foreground modeling , including a new estimate of dust polarization .",
    "recall also that the first - year result was based on the combinations of ka , q , v , and w bands and did not include a dust polarization template in contrast to the new prescription .",
    "furthermore , if the year - two data are processed in the same way as the first - year data , we obtain a spectrum similar to that in @xcite indicating that the major difference between first - year and three - year results rests on new knowledge of how to make and clean polarization maps .",
    "the new spectrum is fully consistent with the first - year results and prefers a model based just on tt and ee data to a null signal at the @xmath388 level .",
    "however , the new spectrum is also consistent with the absence of a te signal .",
