    "solitons play an important role in a wide range of areas such as optics @xcite , superconducting josephson junction arrays @xcite , particle and nuclear physics @xcite , condensed matter physics @xcite , and many others @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 model , which is a particular case of the klein - gordon equation , was extensively studied in relation to the resonant kink - antikink scattering @xcite , kinks interaction with defects @xcite , with the periodically modulated on - site potential @xcite , and with ac external force @xcite .",
    "the effect of discretization scheme on the properties of the @xmath2 kinks has been analysed in @xcite .",
    "solitons in nonintegrable models can support internal vibrational modes @xcite which make soliton dynamics much richer than in the integrable sine - gordon equation @xcite , since energy exchange between translational and vibrational modes is possible .",
    "solitary waves are very robust with respect to small perturbations , they can travel long distances and survive collisions with each other and thus , they are very efficient in energy transfer .",
    "colliding solitons can produce high energy density spots and for many applications it is important to know how large the energy density can be in multi - soliton collisions .",
    "recently we have addressed this issue in the realm of the integrable sine - gordon equation @xcite .",
    "it was found that maximal energy density that can be observed in collision of @xmath0 slowly moving kinks / antikinks is proportional to @xmath1 , while total energy of the system is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "such a high energy density can be achieved only if the kinks and antikinks approach the collision point in an alternating array , where each soliton has nearest neighbors of the opposite topological charge and thus , all solitons attract their nearest neighbors .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath0 is odd ( even ) the maxiaml energy density is in the form of potential ( kinetic ) energy with kinetic ( potential ) energy being zero . in the present study the same problem",
    "is addressed for the @xmath2 model to see the effect of non - integrability of the model and the effect of the kink s internal modes ( i m ) on the maximal energy density and on the scenarios of multi - kink collisions .",

    "[ sec : ii ] the problem to solve is described . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] , by integrating numerically the @xmath2 equation of motion , we estimate the maximal energy density observed in the collision of @xmath0 slowly moving kinks and antikinks with no initially excited kink s i m . the effect of the initially excited kink s i m on the maximal energy density is discussed in sec .",

    "( [ phi4 ] ) is proposed as follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lattice spacing , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . in order to minimize the effect of discreteness , the term @xmath26 in eq .",

    "it has been shown that @xmath0 kinks / antikinks can collide at one point if each of them has nearest neighbors with the opposite topological charge , and thus all quasiparticles are mutually attractive @xcite . here",
