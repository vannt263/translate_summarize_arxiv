    "feynman presented a challenge  @xcite :  is there any method of computing the anomalous moment of the electron which , on first approximation , gives a fair approximation to the @xmath7 term and a crude one to @xmath8 ; and when improved , increases the accuracy of the @xmath8 term , yielding a rough estimate to @xmath9 and beyond .",
    "\" an interesting attempt to answer feynman s challenge using sidewise dispersion relations was pioneered by drell and pagels  @xcite , but it is difficult to make this method systematic .",

    "thus a systematic evaluation of the lepton s fock - state wave functions as an expansion in fock number rather than perturbation theory would provide a physically appealing answer to feynman s challenge  @xcite .    in principle the complete spectrum of a quantum field theory can be determined by finding the eigenvalues of the light - cone hamiltonian  @xcite .",

    "this method has been successfully applied to a large variety of gauge theories and supersymmetric theories in @xmath16 and @xmath17 dimensions .",
    "an essential problem in applying light - cone fock - state methods to renormalizable gauge theory is to regularize the calculations in such a way as to preserve lorentz and gauge invariance , or at least preserve them well enough to allow an effective renormalization to be performed . since the method of regularization must also allow for efficient calculations to be performed , the problem presents a challenge .",
    "we have recently performed nonperturbative calculations using the generalized pauli ",
    "villars ( pv ) method as an ultraviolet regulator of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional quantum field theories .",
    "we include a sufficient number of pv fields in the lagrangian to ensure that perturbation theory is finite .",
    "this method explicitly preserves lorentz invariance ; in some cases , such as qed , it effectively preserves gauge invariance . in a case where it breaks gauge invariance , such as qcd",
    ", we have to add counterterms .",
    "the pv regularization can produce a finite theory which preserves lorentz and gauge symmetries .",

    "our approximation involves truncating the fock space .",
    "the truncation will break all of the symmetries .",
    "however , the usefulness of the truncated answer is a question of accuracy rather than an issue of symmetry breaking . with regulators in place",
    "we presume that there is an exact solution which preserves all symmetries including gauge invariance , and if our approximate solution is close to the exact one , even if the small difference is in such a direction as to maximally violate the symmetries , it is still a small difference . of course",
    ", the inclusion of negative - metric fields in the lagrangian will also violate unitarity .",
    "we shall have more to say about this issue below .",
    "the generalized pv method has been applied successfully to yukawa - like theories  @xcite where there are no infrared divergences and no need to protect gauge symmetry .",
    "an important conclusion of these studies is that past some threshold ( which depends on the values of the coupling constant and the values of the pv masses ) , there is always a rapid drop off of the projection of the eigensolution wave function onto higher fock sectors , in contrast to the equal - time fock - space expansion .",
    "this provides a strong motivation for the light - cone representation as a viable approximant to nonperturbative theory .    in this paper",
    "we will test the convergence of the pv - regulated light - cone fock - state expansion for ( 3 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory by applying it to a nonperturbative calculation of the electron anomalous moment in qed . in some ways this application to qed",
    "is not an ideal test of these nonperturbative methods : the physical electron is a very perturbative object . we do not expect to do better , or even as well as perturbation theory .",
    "however , that is not our objective ; we simply want to verify that an approximate nonperturbative solution for the electron s magnetic moment is an approximation to qed . somewhat related work , from a strictly perturbative point of view , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "careful studies have also shown  @xcite that the perturbative series obtained from particular combinations of pv fields and higher derivative regulators give the same result as standard perturbation series regulated with dimensional regularization .",
    "these studies not only included yukawa theory , but also non - abelian gauge theory . in section",
    "[ sec : lc ] , we shall apply this method of regularization , together with a fock - space truncation to the calculation of the electron magnetic moment .",
    "this is the first application of this regularization to a nonperturbative problem .",
    "we find that there are three problems which must be solved in order to produce a useful calculation of the electron s magnetic moment : the problem of uncanceled divergences , the problem of maintaining gauge invariance , and the problem of new singularities .",
    "we believe that we have found effective solutions to these problems , at least for the present calculations .",
    "the problem of uncanceled divergences occurs anytime we truncate the fock space . for example , if we truncate the physical electron s fock space to include only the subspace of one fermion and one photon , calculate the wave function nonperturbatively , and use that wave function to calculate the moment , we obtain a result of the form : @xmath18 } \\over 1        + \\alpha \\times { \\rm [ finite\\ ; quantity ] } + \\alpha \\times { \\rm [ finite\\ ; quantity ] } \\log { \\mu_1\\over m^2_e}},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the pv photon mass .",

    "the ward identity @xmath26 guarantees the cancellation of the divergences from wave function and vertex renormalization subgraphs .",
    "however , if the three - particle fock state @xmath27 is excluded by the truncation of the fock space , @xmath28 is ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent since the vertex correction shown in amplitude ( c ) is missing .",
    "the divergent contribution to the lepton anomalous moment @xmath29 is the source of the uv divergence in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ae ] ) due to fock - space truncation .",
    "of course , @xmath30 remains uv finite .",
    "the divergence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ae ] ) does not happen in perturbation theory ; since the numerator is already of order @xmath7 , we would use only the 1 from the denominator . at order @xmath8",
    "there would be new terms in the numerator which would cancel the divergent terms in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ae ] ) .",
    "the above discussion illustrates the problem of uncanceled divergences . while we could find ways of allowing the bare mass and the coupling constant to depend on the pv masses to give a finite expression",
    ", the results would not look anything like the results from perturbation theory , since in qed the coupling is renormalized only by vacuum polarization .",
    "in addition , the results would not make sense physically .",
    "our resolution of this difficulty is to keep the pv masses finite .",
    "the motivation is as follows : if the limit of infinite pv masses would give a useful answer in the case where we do not truncate the fock space ( so we have no uncanceled divergences ) , then there must be some finite value of the pv masses that would also give a useful answer .",
    "the question is whether we can use a sufficiently large value . to answer that question",
    "we must consider that there are two types of error associated with the values of the pv masses .",
    "the first type of error results in having these masses too small ; then our wave function will contain too much of the negative - normed states , unitarity will be badly violated , and in the worst case we might get negative probabilities .",
    "we can roughly estimate the magnitude of that type of error as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the physical mass scale and @xmath33 is the pv mass scale .",
    "the other type of error results when the pv masses are too large ; in that case the true wave function will project significantly onto the parts of the representation space excluded by the truncation .",
    "we can roughly estimate the magnitude of that type of error as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the projection of the wave function onto the excluded sectors . in practice , the projection onto the first excluded fock sector can be estimated perturbatively using the projection of @xmath36 onto the higher sectors as the perturbing operator . without additional information ,",
    "the best that we can do is to set @xmath37 equal to the perturbative estimate of @xmath38 .",
    "below , we will apply this procedure to the calculation of the magnetic moment done in this paper .",
    "in general , if , at our estimated optimum value for the pv mass scale both types of error are small , we can do a useful calculation ; otherwise , we can not do a useful calculation without expanding the part of the representation space that we include in our calculation .",
    "the main reason for believing that we can do a useful calculation in spite of the problem of uncanceled divergences is the lesson from the earlier studies mentioned above : the observed rapid drop off of the projection of the wave function onto higher fock sectors .",
    "just where this rapid drop off occurs depends on the theory , the coupling constant , and the values of the pv masses . at weak coupling and relatively light pv masses ,",
    "only the lowest fock sectors are significantly populated . at stronger coupling or heavier pv masses ,",
    "more fock sectors will be populated ; but eventually the projection onto higher sectors will fall rapidly . the rapid drop off of the projection of the wave function onto sufficiently high fock sectors is the most important reason why we do our calculations in the light - cone representation . for any practical calculation in a realistic theory",
    ", we have to truncate the space , and we must have a framework in which that procedure can lead to a useful calculation . the rapid drop off in the projection of the wave function will not happen in the equal - time representation , mostly due to the complexity of the vacuum in that representation .    these features can be explicitly demonstrated by setting the pv masses equal to the physical masses . in that case",
    "the theory becomes exactly solvable  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is the free spectrum , and the theory is not useful for describing real physical processes due to the strong presence of the negative - norm states in physical wave functions ; however , it still illustrates the points we have been trying to make . in the equal - mass case , the physical vacuum is the bare light - cone vacuum , while it is a very complicated state in the equal - time representation ; the physical wave functions project onto a finite number of fock sectors in the light - cone representation but onto an infinite number of sectors in the equal - time representation .",
    "as the pv masses become larger than the physical masses , the light - cone wave functions project onto more of the representation space .",
    "this effect is increased as the coupling constant becomes larger .",
    "however , the wave functions remain much simpler than in the equal - time representation , and , to the extent we can do the calculations , there is always a point of rapid drop off of the projection onto higher fock sectors . due to this rapid drop off , we expect to find a pv mass scale such that the error in the calculated value for a given observable from the presence of negative - norm states and the error from truncation can both be made arbitrarily small .",
    "therefore , we believe the requirement to keep the value of the pv masses finite does not impose a limit on the accuracy which could , in principle , be achieved . in practice , the size of the representation space may be too large for presently available computing facilities .",
    "furthermore , for the method to be useful in practice , there must not only be a value of the pv mass for which both types of errors are small , but there must be a wide range of such values since the optimum value for the pv mass can only be rather crudely estimated . a principal objective of the present work is to test these ideas on a physically realistic problem to which we know the answer .",
    "the problem of maintaining gauge invariance turns out to be nontrivial and quite instructive . in the next section we consider the following procedure : we take the light - cone evolution operator @xmath36 for qed in light - cone gauge @xmath39 as constructed , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite and regulate it with pv fields .",
    "we looked at several cases : pv photons alone , pv fermions alone , and a combination of both .",
    "this procedure does not lead to a viable nonperturbative formalism for the electron magnetic moment ; furthermore , it does not lead to a correct calculation of the electron self - energy , even at order @xmath40 the problem can be traced to a failure to maintain gauge invariance .",
    "the breakdown of the straightforward implementation of the pv method in light - cone gauge shows that the successful construction of the nonperturbative theory is nontrivial .    in section  [ sec : fy ]",
    "we perform the calculation in feynman gauge with one pv photon and one pv fermion ; this leads to a consistent formulation for the nonperturbative calculation of the electron moment in qed . in section  [ sec : lc ] we perform the calculation in light - cone gauge , but use the more sophisticated method of regulation proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we show that this method provides a successful formulation of the nonperturbative electron moment problem in light - cone gauge with a result very similar to that in feynman gauge .    in sections  [ sec : fy ] and [ sec : lc ]",
    "we face the problem of new singularities .",
    "we have to do integrals with denominators of the form @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the physical electron mass , @xmath43 is the bare electron mass , and @xmath44 is the photon mass .",
    "when the bare mass is less than the physical mass , as is the case in qed , there can be a zero in this denominator .",
    "in perturbation theory the expansion is about @xmath45 , and the denominator can not vanish as long as the photon is given a small nonzero mass .",
    "the standard techniques in perturbation theory thus avoid this singularity .",
    "we find that when the zero is a simple pole , the principal - value prescription is correct .",
    "however , in the wave function normalization the denominator is squared , so there is a double pole , and we must give it a meaning .",
    "we propose the following prescription : @xmath46 ^ 2 }     \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\equiv   \\lim_{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0 } { 1\\over 2 \\epsilon } \\int dy \\int dk_\\perp^2 f(y , k_\\perp^2 ) \\bigg[{1 \\over",
    "[ m^2 y + \\mu_0 ^ 2 ( 1-y ) - m^2 y ( 1-y ) + k_\\perp^2 - \\epsilon ] }     \\nonumber \\\\ & & - { 1 \\over [ m^2 y + \\mu_0 ^ 2 ( 1-y ) - m^2 y ( 1-y ) + k_\\perp^2 + \\epsilon]}\\bigg ] , \\label{prescr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where simple poles are prescribed as principal values .",
    "this prescription has the interesting consequence that the wave function normalization is infrared finite whereas it is infrared divergent in perturbation theory .",
    "given this prescription , the true singularity occurs at @xmath47 ; in perturbation theory , with @xmath45 , this is at @xmath48 , which is the infrared singularity and the reason that the photon mass can not be taken all the way to zero in perturbation theory . for the nonperturbative calculation",
    ", the physical photon mass can be taken to zero since @xmath49 .",
    "the basic requirement of these prescriptions is that they preserve the ward identities .",
    "we anticipate using this prescription for qcd where the basic requirement will be the preservation of the ward  takahashi identities .",
    "we have not shown that the prescription preserves the ward identities in qed , but it does lead to a successful calculation in the present case .",
    "a different approach to this same dressed - electron problem has been taken by karmanov , mathiot , and smirnov  @xcite .",
    "they use a covariant form of light - cone quantization without pauli  villars regularization .",
    "their hamiltonian then contains instantaneous fermion interactions , and , in feynman gauge , the infinite number of terms generated by inversion of the covariant derivative .",
    "the problem of uncancelled divergences is avoided by application of sector - dependent renormalization  @xcite .",
    "they must construct counterterms explicitly .",
    "however , they truncate in a fock basis where the constituent electron has the same mass as the dressed electron , bringing their calculation closer to perturbation theory ; in fact , they find that any signifant difference with perturbation theory will not appear until the basis is expanded to include higher fock states .",
    "also , they do not calculate the anomalous moment .",
    "in this and the next section the notation that we use for light - cone coordinates is @xmath50 the time coordinate is @xmath51 , and the dot product of two four - vectors is @xmath52 the momentum component conjugate to @xmath53 is @xmath54 , and the light - cone energy is @xmath55 .",
    "light - cone three - vectors are identified by underscores , such as @xmath56 we use the following choice for the @xmath57 matrices @xmath58 for additional details , see appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use the standard @xmath36 for light - cone quantized qed in light - cone gauge  @xcite with modifications due to the inclusion of the pv fields .",
    "we should remark , however , that with the inclusion of any number of pv fermi fields , the four - point interactions which would take a state of one electron and one photon to another state of one electron and one photon are missing from @xmath36 ; that such terms are not included below is not an omission ; the calculation is complete in our chosen subspace .",
    "we truncate the fock space to the one - fermion sector plus the one - fermion , one - photon sector .",
    "we then solve the eigenvalue problem @xmath59 where the total @xmath60 of the state is taken equal to 0 .",
    "as always with a tamm - dancoff truncation , we can solve for the wave function in the highest fock sector ( one fermion plus one photon ) by hand and obtain an equation in the one - fermion sector .",
    "we have regulated the theory in several ways .",
    "we shall describe one particular choice in some detail : we use three pv fermi fields with flavor - changing currents .",
    "the flavor - changing currents break gauge invariance , and thus we might expect to require counterterms to correct for that .",
    "nevertheless , we will proceed with the calculation without counterterms .",
    "that will allow us to study a case where a proper respect for gauge invariance is not maintained .",
    "also , as we shall argue below , the source of the breaking of gauge invariance is much deeper than that due to the flavor - changing currents .    for the lagrangian",
    "we take @xmath61 where @xmath62 a particular realization of these pv conditions is @xmath63 with this choice it is convenient to define @xmath64 so that the @xmath65 fields are canonically normalized ( except for the minus signs for @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) .",
    "the coupling to the @xmath68 field is @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we use the mode expansions @xmath72 , \\label{me1}\\ ] ] @xmath73\\label{me2},\\ ] ] where the polarization states are @xmath74 @xmath75 the vertex functions can be computed from @xmath36 as @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80    we expand the eigenstate as @xmath81 we will take the wave function normalization @xmath82 to be 1 for the moment and calculate it later . from @xmath83",
    "we find immediately ( in units where @xmath84 is taken to 1 ) : @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 from all this we derive the four nonlinear equations @xmath88 these can be written in terms of the three integrals : @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 where @xmath92 the nonlinear equations become @xmath93 while these equations are complicated , they can be simplified by the observation that , for the parameter values of interest , @xmath94 is very much larger than @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "also , for those parameter values , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are small compared to one , and a solution sufficiently accurate for our needs is given by the simple expression @xmath100    we can use the wave function to calculate the anomalous magnetic moment using the formalism of brodsky and drell  @xcite .",
    "the contribution from the physical field is much larger that the contributions from the pv fields , so we have @xmath101 where @xmath82 is determined by wave function normalization : @xmath102 we find @xmath103    we can now state the problem with this calculation : @xmath94 has a very strong dependence on @xmath104 ( the pv mass scale ) . that , in turn , gives our estimate of the anomalous magnetic moment a very strong dependence on @xmath104 .",
    "if we use units of @xmath105 , so that the correct value is near one , then we find that , even with a value for the photon mass as large as 0.5 electron masses , when @xmath104 changes from 3 times the electron mass to 7 times the electron mass , @xmath13 changes from 1.2 to -1.2 .",
    "if we use a smaller value for the photon mass , which we would surely have to do to get useful results , the dependence is even stronger . since we can not hope to estimate the optimum value for the pv mass scale even to within this range , the present calculation is clearly useless .",
    "the problem is clearly the loss of gauge invariance ; gauge invariance should prevent such strong behavior .",
    "one might reasonably think that the problem is the flavor - changing currents we have included in the calculation , but we shall now argue that the worst breaking of gauge invariance has a more fundamental source .",
    "we shall return to the breaking due to flavor - changing currents in the next section .",
    "we note that if we keep only the physical field and set @xmath106 , the function which appears in our nonlinear equations is just the ( unregulated ) one - loop fermion self - energy @xmath107 therefore , a very useful point of comparison is the evaluation of the fermion self - energy calculated in the paper by brodsky , roskies and suaya  @xcite , hereafter referenced as brs .",
    "they evaluated all the graphs needed to calculate the electron s magnetic moment in perturbation theory through order @xmath8 .",
    "included in their calculations is the one - loop electron self - energy .",
    "they did not use light - cone quantization but wrote down time - ordered perturbation theory in the equal - time representation and then boosted to the infinite momentum frame .",
    "they worked in feynman gauge , but the electron self - energy should be gauge invariant .",
    "they give the self - energy as the sum of two separate pieces , @xmath108 and @xmath109 ; @xmath109 results from boosting the z - graph while @xmath108 comes from the other time ordering .",
    "they obtain in our notation ( see eqs .  ( 3.40 ) and ( 3.41 ) of brs ) @xmath110 @xmath111 brs show that if the theory is regulated with the inclusion of two pv photons , the sum of @xmath108 and @xmath109 is equal to the usual feynman one - loop self - energy in qed , regulated in the same way .",
    "notice that @xmath109 implements the requirement of chiral symmetry : the shift in the bare mass is zero if the bare mass is zero , that is , @xmath112 .",
    "terms such as @xmath109 are often missed in light - cone quantization . that fact has been noticed at least as far back as the work of chang and yan  @xcite .",
    "those authors suggest that the problem can be solved by including an extra pv field and using it to implement the chiral symmetry condition ; that is a technique we have used in the past  @xcite . since @xmath109 does not depend on the mass , inclusion of pv fermi fields will also solve the problem .",
    "that possibility was noticed by brs , and we shall use this method in the next sections . therefore without pv fermi fields we might not expect to get the sum of @xmath108 and @xmath109 correctly , but we should expect to at least reproduce @xmath108 .",
    "we do not have to get the same integrand , but we should get the same result after integration if the regulation preserves covariance . however , if we use two pv photons , or three pv photons with the third field used to eliminate @xmath109 , we do not obtain the correct result for @xmath113    we can gain some further insight into what is going on by observing that , in feynman methods , the light - cone gauge is obtained from feynman gauge by the replacement @xmath114 from that replacement there is no obvious source for the double pole at @xmath115 that we see in our light - cone calculation .",
    "the explanation is that , in some formal sense without worrying about regulation , light - cone quantization accomplishes the replacement by writing @xmath116 the first three terms correspond to the usual three - point interactions that one obtains by usual light - cone quantization as given , for instance , in  @xcite .",
    "the last term is given by the so called `` instantaneous '' ( four - point ) interactions which result from solving the constraint equation for the photon .",
    "in at least some cases , for tree level processes the required cancellations actually occur , and results equivalent to the equal - time formulation are obtained .",
    "however , here , at one loop , the cancellations are not working correctly , and we can see why as follows : if we write down the feynman integral whose numerator is @xmath117 regulate the calculation with two pv photons , and perform the @xmath118 integral , we get an amplitude which can not be obtained from a four - point interaction @xmath119 when this amplitude is added to our light - cone amplitude , ( [ lca ] ) , we get precisely @xmath108 .",
    "there is no doubt that @xmath108  with the perturbative denominator , @xmath120 , replaced by the nonperturbative denominator , @xmath121  is the function that should enter our nonlinear equations .",
    "we could fix the problem here by just using @xmath108 with the perturbative denominator replaced by the nonperturbative denominator , but since we do not know how to make similar corrections in other cases , we do not consider that replacement to be useful .",
    "it is clear that the problem is that gauge invariance has been lost in solving the constraint equation @xmath122 it is possible that the wrong boundary conditions have been used in solving this equation or that the equation must be modified : the constraint equation satisfied by the regulated fields and something like schwinger terms may need to be included .",
    "the loss of gauge invariance using standard light - cone techniques deserves further study .",

    "the difference between the answers we obtained here in the feynman gauge and in the light - cone gauge provides some test of that idea .",
    "the answers differ by some two percent .",
    "we believe that the fact that they are close to each other is due to the fact that they are close to the answer which would result from a calculation without truncation .",
    "the objective of the calculations presented here was not to improve on the very accurate calculations of perturbation theory .",
    "rather , the objective was to verify that the nonperturbative methods we have developed really do represent a nonperturbative approximation to qed .",
    "we have succeeded in this , not only because the answers we get are as close as can be expected to the correct answer but also because an expansion of our approximate , nonperturbative answer in powers of the coupling constant reproduces the finite terms of standard qed perturbation theory , through the order allowed by our truncation of the representation space .",
    "we get additional terms up to all orders in the coupling constant , which can be identified as some of the terms of standard perturbation theory .",

    "<S> in principle , the complete spectrum and bound - state wave functions of a quantum field theory can be determined by finding the eigenvalues and eigensolutions of its light - cone hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> one of the challenges in obtaining nonperturbative solutions for gauge theories such as qcd using light - cone hamiltonian methods is to renormalize the theory while preserving lorentz symmetries and gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the truncation of the light - cone fock space leads to uncompensated ultraviolet divergences . </S>",
    "<S> we present two methods for consistently regularizing light - cone - quantized gauge theories in feynman and light - cone gauges : ( 1 ) the introduction of a spectrum of pauli  villars fields which produces a finite theory while preserving lorentz invariance ; ( 2 ) the augmentation of the gauge - theory lagrangian with higher derivatives . in the latter case , which is applicable to light - cone gauge ( @xmath0 ) , the @xmath1 component of the gauge field </S>",
    "<S> is maintained as an independent degree of freedom rather than a constraint . </S>",
    "<S> finite - mass pauli  </S>",
    "<S> villars regulators can also be used to compensate for neglected higher fock states . as a test case </S>",
    "<S> , we apply these regularization procedures to an approximate nonperturbative computation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron in qed as a first attempt to meet feynman s famous challenge .    </S>",
