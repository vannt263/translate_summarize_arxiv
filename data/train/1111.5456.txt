    "one of the scientific and technological revolutions currently in progress is the increasing ability to miniaturize material design and manufacturing components .",
    "advances in the chemical synthesis and fabrication of nanometer - to - micrometer sized particles have produced a variety of new particles .",
    "their organization into more complex structures remains , however , a great challenge .",
    "a promising approach inspired by nature is nanoparticle self - assembly .",
    "the structure of the self - assembled clusters , which range from chains to rings and complex branched structures , depends crucially on the anisotropy of the particle shapes and interactions and may compete with the clustering that drives condensation , giving rise to novel macroscopic behavior @xcite .",
    "indeed , patchy particle models with dissimilar patches ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) were recently introduced in this context and revealed that the criticality depends on the type of clusters that are formed @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are systems where the self - assembled clusters are long linear chains connected by junctions , as the liquid - vapor transition of these network ( percolated ) fluids may be viewed as the condensation of these junctions @xcite .",
    "in addition to ferrofluids or electro - rheological fluids , colloids with distinct patchy interactions may be synthesized by the selective functionalisation of specific areas of the particles @xcite .",
    "primitive models of patchy particles with identical @xcite and distinct patches share the physics of limited valence materials , namely the existence of stable liquid states of vanishingly small density ( empty liquids ) , and provide a route to equilibrium gels @xcite .",
    "in addition , distinct - patch models allow a unique control of the effective valence through the temperature @xmath5 . in three - dimensional ( 3d ) off - lattice models consisting of particles with two types of patches , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where the interaction between @xmath1 patches is set to zero",
    ", the topology of the liquid - vapor diagram is determined by the ratio between the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 interactions , @xmath4 .",
    "as @xmath4 decreases in the range @xmath6 , the low - temperature liquid - vapor coexistence region also decreases @xcite .",
    "the binodal exhibits a characteristic re - entrant or `` pinched '' shape with the coexisting liquid density vanishing as the temperature approaches zero @xcite .",
    "below @xmath7 there is no condensation , and above @xmath8 there is no re - entrant behavior @xcite .",
    "both the scaling of the vanishing critical parameters and the re - entrant phase behavior are predicted correctly by wertheim s thermodynamic first - order perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the theory also reveals that the re - entrant phase behavior is driven by the balance of two entropic contributions : the higher entropy of the junctions and the lower entropy of the chains in the ( network ) liquid phase , as suggested a decade ago on the basis of a hierarchical theory of network fluids @xcite .",
    "the feature that makes patchy particles ideally suited to the investigation of the interplay between self - assembly and condensation is the fact that both the thermodynamic and structural properties of patchy particle systems can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy by the thermodynamic perturbation theory of wertheim and the flory - stockmayer theory of polymerization @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to study the phase behavior of patchy particles using reliable liquid - state theories and to use this knowledge to design the models and guide the simulations , the results of which validated the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "there remain , however , two open questions : 1 .",
    "what is the nature of the liquid - vapor critical point , in models with an empty fluid regime ? and 2 .",
    "are there ordered phases that pre - empt the empty fluid regime or , what is the topology of the global phase diagram ?",
    "these are difficult questions that will be addressed here by considering simple patchy particle models on the square lattice .    in systems with two bonding sites per particle , only ( polydisperse ) linear chains form and there is no liquid - vapor phase transition @xcite . if the chains are sufficiently stiff they undergo an ordering transition at fixed concentration , as the temperature decreases below the bonding temperature .",
    "the interplay between the self - assembly process , driven by the bonding interactions , and the ordering transition , driven by the anisotropic shape of the bonded clusters has been investigated for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) model consisting of particles with two bonding sites , on the square lattice ( self - assembling rigid rods or sarr model ) . it was shown that bonding drives ordering and that the ordering enhances bonding @xcite . subsequently , extensive monte carlo simulations were carried out to investigate the nature of the ordering transition that was shown to be in the ising 2d universality class , as in models where the rods are monodisperse @xcite .",
    "the scaling region , however , was found to depend strongly on the temperature @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the @xmath9 model consisting of particles with four patches , two of type @xmath0 and two of type @xmath1 , on the square lattice and investigate its global phase behavior by simulations and theory .",
    "we set the interaction between @xmath1 patches to zero and calculate the phase diagram , as the ratio of the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 interactions , @xmath4 , varies .",
    "we find that , in the same range of parameters as in 3d off - lattice models , the liquid - vapor diagram exhibits a re - entrant or `` pinched '' shape , and there is an empty fluid regime . in addition , below @xmath7 condensation ceases to exist , and the re - entrant regime disappears for @xmath10 , in line with the results for off - lattice 3d models and the predictions of wertheim s theory @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the thresholds predicted by wertheim s theory are exact and universal , i.e. independent of the dimensionality of the system and of the lattice structure .",
    "finally , the @xmath9 model exhibits an order - disorder ( o - d ) transition that is ferromagnetic for @xmath11 .",
    "the use of 2d lattice models allows the simulation of larger systems enabling us to establish the nature of the critical points and to investigate the structure of the network liquid phase in the empty fluid regime , where the size of the `` voids '' increases rapidly as the temperature decreases .",
    "we find that the liquid - vapor critical points are in the 2d ising universality class , with a scaling region that decreases as the temperature decreases .",
    "the simulation results also indicate that the line of o - d transitions intersects the condensation line at zero temperature and density , at a multicritical point , or at a very low temperature , at a critical end - point .",
    "the analysis of this region requires the simulation of larger systems at extremely low temperatures , which becomes prohibitive even for 2d patchy particle lattice models .    in order to proceed we consider a low - temperature - model ( ltm ) that describes the asymptotic behavior of 2d patchy particle models at low temperatures , and use a cluster algorithm that enables the efficient simulation of these low temperature systems .",
    "finally , we derive asymptotic expressions based on wertheim s theory , for the liquid branch of the binodal and the o - d transition that suggest , in line with the simulation results , that the transition lines meet , at a multicritical point , at zero temperature and density .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in section ii we describe the patchy particle model , the mapping of the full lattice limit and the simulation methods . in section",
    "iii we present the results for the global phase diagram of a system with a re - entrant binodal .",
    "we compute the binodals , analyze the nature of the liquid - vapor critical points , and discuss the topology of the global phase diagram for systems with a ferromagnetic ordering transition ( re - entrant regime ) . in section iv we introduce the ltm and the simulation techniques developed to sample low temperatures efficiently .",
    "we compute the binodals and the ferromagnetic ordering transition and discuss the topology of the global phase diagram .",
    "then , in section v we address the zero temperature and zero density limit theoretically .",
    "we derive asymptotic expressions for the condensation and o - d transitions based on wertheim s theory for associating liquids , in the limit of strong @xmath3 bonding .",
    "we conclude , based on the asymptotic analysis , that the condensation and o - d lines meet at a multicritical point , at zero temperature and density . in section",
    "vi we make some concluding remarks and in the appendix provide details of the calculation of the starting point of the liquid - vapor equilibrium of the ltm , used in the gibbs - duhem integration of the liquid branch of the binodals .",
    "the model consists of particles with four patches , two of type @xmath0 and two of type @xmath1 , on a square lattice .",
    "the lattice sites are either empty or occupied by one single particle .",
    "the patches @xmath0 and @xmath1 are aligned along one of the two lattice directions ( see figure [ fig01 ] ) .",
    "there are two configurations for each occupied site : ( 1 ) @xmath0 patches aligned along @xmath12 and @xmath1 patches aligned along @xmath13 , and the symmetric configuration with ( 2 ) @xmath0 patches aligned along @xmath13 and @xmath1 patches aligned along @xmath12 .",
    "the potential energy , @xmath14 , is the sum of pair interactions between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) particles on the lattice and is written as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of @xmath17 bonds , i.e. lattice bonds between nn occupied sites connecting patches @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this model is a lattice realization of the patchy particle models with distinct patches introduced in @xcite and investigated in the context of empty network fluids @xcite . in line with previous work",
    "we take @xmath20 as the energy scale ( @xmath21 ) , and focus on systems where the @xmath1 patches do not interact , i.e. @xmath22 . the interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath1 patches varies although most of the results are for systems in the re - entrant regime , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "taking into account that each particle carries two @xmath0 patches and that a patch can participate , at most , in one bond we can write : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of particles in the system and @xmath26 is the number of patches that are not bonded . combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath27 we get : @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) it follows that @xmath3 bonds are favored when @xmath29 , while @xmath2 bonds are favored when @xmath30 . at low temperature ,",
    "most of the @xmath0 patches are bonded and the network fluid consists of @xmath3 chains connected by a small number of @xmath2 branches in the former case while the network is almost fully branched in the latter .",
    "the special case @xmath31 corresponds to a self - assembling rigid rod ( sarr ) model that was studied on 2d lattices recently @xcite . in the sarr model",
    ", a continuous o - d transition is found to be the only feature of the phase diagram . at low temperatures the particles",
    "form long rigid rods , through @xmath3 bonds , which undergo an orientational ordering transition , in the 2d ising class on the square lattice and in the q=3 potts class on the triangular one @xcite .",
    "the sarr model has no liquid - vapor transition as adjacent rods do not interact energetically .      the full lattice limit of the sarr model on the square lattice has been mapped on to the ising model @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by establishing a correspondence between the particle orientations of the sarr model and the spins @xmath32 of the ising model .",
    "the total energy of both models is then computed by adding the contributions of elementary plaquettes , consisting of a square with four sites enclosing an elementary lattice cell .",
    "the mapping between the ising and the full lattice limit of the sarr model , is established for any plaquette configuration and the critical temperature of the model is identified with the exact result of the critical temperature of the corresponding ising model @xcite . following this procedure a similar mapping",
    "is established for the @xmath9 model . at full lattice occupancy ,",
    "the @xmath9 model undergoes an ising o - d transition , at the reduced temperature @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the ordered phase is stable at @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath36 , the ordered phase is ferromagnetic ( particles aligned in the same direction ) if @xmath37 , and antiferromagnetic otherwise , @xmath30 .    note that when @xmath36 and @xmath38 there is no o - d transition",
    ". inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) reveals that at full lattice occupancy every @xmath0 patch is bonded , and therefore all the configurations have the same potential energy .",
    "this degeneracy does not hold when vacancies ( empty sites ) are present but the free energy is still dominated by entropic terms that prevent the system from ordering .",
    "we aim at computing the global phase diagram of the @xmath9 model through monte carlo simulation . based on previous results @xcite a low temperature critical line corresponding to the o - d transition",
    ", the locus of which at @xmath39 is known exactly through the mapping to the ising model ( [ tc2a2b ] ) , is expected to occur ; in addition , a liquid - vapor first - order transition ending at a critical point ( for @xmath40 above a certain threshold ) is also expected .",
    "the o - d transition is located using techniques analogous to those described in @xcite .",
    "we fix the temperature and system size and , by means of the simulated tempering algorithm , compute the properties for different values of the chemical potential around the expected critical point . by using appropriate finite - size scaling analysis we obtain estimates of the critical parameters , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the liquid vapor equilibria ( lve ) is computed using a combination of wang - landau multicanonical simulation ( wlmc ) @xcite and gibbs - duhem integration ( gdi ) procedures @xcite adapted to lattice models @xcite .",
    "the wlmc methodology was described previously , including the details specific to lattice models @xcite .",
    "wlmc simulations , combined with finite - size analysis techniques , are very efficient in locating the liquid - vapor critical point , and in computing the phase diagram at temperatures not far from it . at low temperatures we found it useful to resort to gdi schemes .",
    "we run wlmc simulations and locate the lve at a given temperature and system size by searching for the value of the chemical potential , @xmath43 , that maximizes the density fluctuations : @xmath44^{1/2 } $ ] . under these conditions",
    "we compute the average density , @xmath45 , and the moments of the density distribution , @xmath46 , in order to calculate the ratio @xmath47 , which is related to the fourth - order binder cumulant @xcite .",
    "we establish whether at the chosen temperature @xmath5 there is lve by analyzing the dependence of @xmath48 on the system size .",
    "lve occurs below the critical temperature , where at @xmath49 the density distribution function exhibits two peaks that become sharper as the system size @xmath50 increases .",
    "this implies that @xmath51 decreases as @xmath50 increases and approaches @xmath52 in the thermodynamic limit . above @xmath53 ,",
    "@xmath51 increases with @xmath50 and approaches @xmath54 ( gaussian distribution ) in the thermodynamic limit . at the critical temperature , finite - size",
    "scaling arguments @xcite , indicate that ( for sufficiently large systems ) @xmath51 takes a non - trivial value that depends on the boundary conditions and on the universality class of the transition .",
    "we estimate system size dependent pseudo - critical points : @xmath55 $ ] by imposing that @xmath56 takes the value corresponding to the 2d ising universality class @xcite .",
    "numerical details of these calculations may be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we proceed to estimate the critical temperature and density in thermodynamic limit , using the scaling equations:@xcite @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the correlation length critical exponent ( @xmath60 for the 2d ising class ) ; and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the correction to scaling critical exponent .",
    "there is some controversy @xcite concerning the value of @xmath63 for systems in the 2d ising class , as a number of simple models ( e.g. 2d ising ) have no irrelevant operators @xcite .",
    "one then expects , @xmath64 @xcite in general or @xmath65 @xcite in the absence of irrelevant operators . taking this into account , we computed three estimates of the critical temperature ( the same scheme applies to the critical chemical potential ) , using : @xmath64 ; @xmath66 ; and considering @xmath63 as a fitting parameter .    at temperatures below @xmath53 we fit the system - size dependent lve results to the scaling equations : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the finite - size result for the property @xmath69 , and @xmath70 ( obtained from the fit )",
    "is the estimate of the property in the thermodynamic limit ; @xmath71 is the spatial dimensionality of the system .",
    "we have obtained very precise values of the chemical potential at coexistence , which were subsequently used in the gdi to compute the lve in a wider range of temperatures ( away from the critical point ) . within the gdi we run sequences of two phase ( liquid and vapor ) simulations using larger system sizes ( than those feasible with wlmc ) allowing us to sample lower temperatures , in the empty liquid regime .    in the computation of the critical parameters , described above",
    ", we assumed that the critical point of the lve is in the 2d ising universality class .",
    "as this is not yet established , we proceed to analyze the scaling behavior of the pseudocritical parameters , and the moments of the density distribution , @xmath72 , at the pseudocritical points .",
    "the finite - size scaling behavior of @xmath73 satisfies:@xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the critical exponent of the order parameter ( @xmath76 for 2d ising ) .",
    "we expect the shape of the critical density distribution , @xmath72 , to approach that of the critical ising 2d magnetization @xmath77 , for large system sizes @xcite .",
    "deviations occur for small systems due to corrections to scaling associated to irrelevant fields and field - mixing contributions@xcite .",
    "thus , in addition to checking the scaling of @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath73 , we compare the asymptotic values of the reduced moments of the density distribution , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , to the critical ising 2d values , @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "we start by illustrating , in figure [ fig02 ] , typical configurations of the coexisting phases for a system in the re - entrant regime , with @xmath84 , at three temperatures .",
    "we note that the density of the liquid decreases rapidly as the temperature decreases .",
    "the ( network ) liquid phase is characterized by voids ( regions without particles ) that increase as the temperature decreases .",
    "this observation implies that larger system sizes are required at lower temperatures , in order to sample adequately the increasing length scales that characterize the empty liquid phase .",
    "we consider @xmath9 models characterized by different @xmath4 .",
    "after preliminary wlmc tests we choose appropriate subcritical temperatures and compute the liquid - vapor equilibria by extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit the results of several system sizes .",
    "we then select a temperature ( for each model ) as the starting point of the gdi .",
    "these are collected in table [ table01 ]    .liquid vapor equilibria from wlmc simulations .",
    "the temperatures are those used as the starting points of subsequent gdis .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,<,<,<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     a final important question remains .",
    "the @xmath9 patchy particle models undergo , in general , two thermodynamic transitions , a first - order liquid - vapor transition at low densities ; and a continuous o - d transition at high densities ( see the phase diagram for @xmath86 in figure [ fig03 ] ) .",
    "previous results @xcite and those discussed here suggest that for appropriate values of @xmath4 both the vapor and the liquid branches of the lve approach zero density at zero temperature ; on the other hand the results for the sarr model @xcite also indicate that the o - d transition approaches zero density at zero temperature .",
    "several scenarios are then plausible for the global phase diagram of the @xmath9 patchy particle model depending on where the o - d critical line intersects the lve line ; this can happen at a finite temperature ( either at a critical end point or at a tricritical point ) or at @xmath87 .",
    "the simulation results for @xmath88 , and @xmath86 , discard the possibility of an upper tricritical point , as the critical temperature of the lve is higher than the exact result for the o - d transition at @xmath39 and previous @xcite and present results ( see figure [ fig03 ] ) suggest that the critical temperature of the o - d transition increases with the density .    the question remains whether the transitions meet at @xmath87 or at a finite temperature critical end point .",
    "for the models with @xmath89 considered here we computed the order parameter on the liquid branch as obtained from the gdi , for several system sizes , and found that the network liquid phase at lve is orientationally disordered .",
    "if a critical end point exists then it has to occur at lower temperatures than those accessible by simulations of the @xmath9 patchy particle model . to proceed we consider a related model in the next section",
    "let us consider @xmath9 models with @xmath36 .",
    "defining @xmath90 we re - write eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) as : @xmath91 with @xmath92 for @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "now consider @xmath96 . at sufficiently low temperatures @xmath26 ( the number of non - bonded @xmath0 patches )",
    "is negligible with respect to both @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and the thermodynamics of the model is determined by @xmath99 .",
    "this suggests that the lve of @xmath9 patchy particle models at low temperatures , and small @xmath63 , may be collapsed ( approximately ) onto a single curve .",
    "the previous discussion suggests the consideration of a related low temperature model ( ltm ) with interaction energies : @xmath100 ( i.e. non - bonded @xmath0 patches are disallowed ) , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .    in order to compute the lve we assume that the vapor phase at low temperatures has zero density .",
    "this results from the fact that , as all @xmath0 patches are bonded , the particles must belong to a network that percolates in , at least , one direction ; since the vapor does not percolate its density must vanish in the thermodynamic limit . we compute the liquid branch of the ltm using gibbs - duhem integration , with thermodynamic variables @xmath103 and @xmath104 . the differential equation to be solved is:@xcite @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath25 and @xmath97 correspond to the liquid branch ( the vapor has zero density ) . the starting point for the integration",
    "is @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath109 is discussed in the appendix . at full lattice occupancy",
    "the ltm is equivalent to the original patchy particle model , since all @xmath0 patches are bonded , and thus the ltm may also be used to compute the o - d transition .    in the ltm",
    "every @xmath0 patch is bonded ( either to another @xmath0 or to a @xmath1 patch ) .",
    "in addition , the density of the liquid phase decreases rapidly as @xmath103 increases , in the empty fluid regime .",
    "a standard algorithm involving single particle moves is useless under these conditions . in order to sample the ltm we develop an efficient cluster algorithm that is described below .",
    "the ltm algorithm is based on three types of moves : ( a ) rotation of particles ( only if the four nns of the particle are occupied ) ; ( b ) insertion of a sequence of aligned particles ; ( c ) deletion of a sequence of aligned particles .",
    "the rotation move is straightforward .",
    "one particle with four nns occupied is selected at random ( if there is any ) , and then one of its two orientations is chosen with a probability proportional to its boltzmann factor .",
    "the insertion / deletion of a sequence of aligned particles is carried out as follows : a lattice site is chosen at random : if the site is occupied then a deletion attempt is performed .",
    "it starts by identifying the linear cluster of particles linked to the selected one by an unbroken sequence of @xmath3 bonds .",
    "such cluster either percolates through the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) or ends at two @xmath2 bonds . if the removal of the cluster leads to an unbonded @xmath0 patch the deletion attempt is rejected , otherwise the acceptance criterion ( defined below ) is applied .",
    "if the chosen site is empty then one direction , @xmath110 , is chosen at random .",
    "a linear @xmath3 cluster of occupied sites is built along the chosen direction ( on both sides ) , the bonding criterion being that the nn position is empty .",
    "the process stops when the cluster percolates through the pbc or when occupied sites are found at both ends . the acceptance criterion ( defined below )",
    "is then applied .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the change in energy when inserting or deleting a ltm cluster .",
    "the cluster either percolates through a sequence of @xmath3 bonds ( @xmath111 ) or terminates at both ends with @xmath2 bonds : @xmath112 . considering that positions ( not insertions / deletions ) are selected at random ,",
    "the acceptance probabilities are : @xmath113\\ ] ] where @xmath114 , and the factor @xmath115 arises from the two orientations of the inserted cluster , of length @xmath116 lattice sites .",
    "the gdi requires as input a point on the lve binodal , which was taken to be @xmath109 , the reduced chemical potential at @xmath108 .",
    "the chemical potential at zero pressure ( the vapor phase has zero density ) is obtained via thermodynamic integration @xcite from ( @xmath117 ) , as the partition function in the full lattice limit and @xmath92 is known exactly : @xmath118 .",
    "we carried out the calculation for different system sizes @xmath119 and found that the size dependence of @xmath120 is negligible , obtaining @xmath121 .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate from the gdi of the patchy particle model with @xmath122 , which gives @xmath123 , at low temperatures .",
    "the lve is obtained using gibbs - duhem integration .",
    "several system sizes are considered to check the system size dependence of the results . in figure [ fig06 ]",
    "we test the accuracy of the ltm to describe the coexisting liquid densities of the @xmath9 patchy particle models , at low temperatures . clearly , the ltm results converge to those of the patchy particle models as the temperature is lowered .",
    "we found that as @xmath103 increases ( scaled temperature decreases ) larger systems are required to obtain consistent results for different system sizes ( as was observed in the simulation of the @xmath9 patchy particle models ) .",
    "indeed , the line corresponding to the ltm liquid branch in figure [ fig06 ] is plotted for scaled temperatures higher than those where the results for systems with @xmath124 and @xmath125 start to show significant differences : i.e. @xmath126 .",
    "this is due to the rapid increase of the size of the voids in the empty liquid at low temperatures , which hinders the simulations of the ltm at larger @xmath103 due to the system size requirements and the loss of efficiency of the simulation algorithm .",
    "finally , we have computed the o - d transition of the ltm , which is almost indistinguishable from that of the @xmath9 model with @xmath86 , after proper re - scaling ( both are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] ) .    despite the difficulties in simulating the lve of the ltm",
    "when @xmath127 , the numerical results suggest that the ratio @xmath128 decreases with @xmath103 , for @xmath129 .",
    "considering that the ltm describes accurately the low temperature phase diagram of the @xmath9 patchy particle models , we conclude that the most likely topology of the phase diagram of this class of models is characterized by a multicritical point at @xmath87 and @xmath130 , where the liquid - vapor and the o - d transitions merge .",
    "in this section we address the topology of the phase diagram by resorting to theoretical / analytical techniques .",
    "the thermodynamics of the @xmath9 patchy particle model can be described using wertheim s first order perturbation theory ( wpt ) , which accounts accurately , in the low density limit , for the effect of association @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig07 ] shows the results of this calculation for several values of @xmath4 .",
    "comparison with the results of simulations ( section iii ) reveals that the theory describes correctly the re - entrance of the liquid branch for @xmath149 and the constant density of the liquid branch at low temperatures when @xmath150 .",
    "the theory also predicts @xcite that no liquid - vapor coexistence occurs when @xmath151 , in line with the results of the simulations for these values of the parameters .",
    "note that , as in 3d off - lattice models @xcite , there is almost quantitative agreement between the critical temperatures obtained by theory and simulations , while the theory underestimates systematically the density of the coexisting liquid branch .",

    "the ordering is driven by the excluded volume of the chains formed at low temperatures @xcite , and this effect is not included in ( [ freenid ] ) nor in ( [ werthiso ] ) .",
    "based on previous works @xcite , we proceed to derive asymptotic expressions for the o - d transition and the liquid branch of the binodal .",
    "this analysis shows that the line of lve is not intersected by the o - d line at any finite temperature , and thus a critical end point does not occur in this model .",

    "it is clear that eq.([binliquidass ] ) is the asymptotic limit of the liquid branch of @xmath9 patchy particle binodals , at low densities and temperatures .",

    "an order parameter @xmath160 ( with @xmath161 being the number density of particles with @xmath0 patches aligned along @xmath162 ) was defined , and it was shown that the field @xmath163 associated to @xmath164 , is , @xmath165,\\ ] ] with @xmath166 and @xmath167 given by , @xmath168 @xmath169    the o - d line is found by solving @xmath170 .",

    "in other words , the empty liquid regime is not pre - empted by the ordered ( liquid ) phase .",
    "we investigated a simple patchy particle lattice model consisting of particles with four bonding sites , two of type @xmath0 and two of type @xmath1 , on the square lattice , and computed its global phase behavior by simulations and theory .",
    "we have set the interaction between @xmath1 patches to zero and calculated the phase diagram as the ratio between the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 interactions , @xmath4 , varies . in line with previous work on three - dimensional off - lattice models",
    ", we have shown that the liquid - vapor phase diagram exhibits a re - entrant or `` pinched '' shape , for an identical range of @xmath4 , suggesting somewhat surprisingly that this range - and the corresponding empty fluid regime - is independent of the dimensionality of the system and of the lattice structure .",
    "in addition , the use of low - dimensional lattice systems allowed the simulations of much larger systems enabling us to establish the nature of the liquid - vapor critical points , which were found to be in the ising 2d class , both in the re - entrant and the normal liquid models . while in the normal liquid regime the scaling regions are typical of models in the 2d ising universality class , in the re - entrant liquid regime the scaling region decreases rapidly as the critical temperature ( or @xmath4 ) decreases .",
    "our theoretical and simulation results also suggest that the ising scaling region vanishes as the critical temperature vanishes , in line with the presence of a multicritical point at zero density and temperature .    the patchy particle models on the square lattice exhibit an o - d transition at fixed density , as the temperature is lowered below the bonding temperature .",
    "this transition is anti - ferromagnetic for normal liquid models and ferromagnetic for models with a re - entrant liquid regime . in the latter models ,",
    "the results of simulations of an appropriate low - temperature - model that describes the asymptotics of the particle patchy systems at low temperatures , together with an efficient sampling cluster algorithm , suggest that the line of o - d transitions intersects the condensation line at zero temperature and zero density .",
    "this topology of the phase diagram is corroborated by an asymptotic theoretical analysis of the liquid branch of the binodal and of the o - d transition , based on wertheim s theory for associating fluids .",
    "the theory is exact at zero density , lending support to the results of the asymptotic analysis in the low temperature , low density region .    in summary",
    ", the results of simulations and of theoretical analysis strongly suggest that the line of o - d transitions intersects the condensation line at a multicritical point at zero temperature and density , for patchy particle lattice models in the re - entrant liquid regime .",
    "the global phase diagram of off - lattice patchy particle models , in 2d and 3d , is further complicated by the presence of stable solid phases .",
    "these phases may pre - empt the empty fluid regime rendering the zero temperature zero density multicritical point metastable .",
