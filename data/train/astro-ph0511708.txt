    "currently there is very little direct information about the structure and strength of magnetic fields in the radiative zone ( rz ) of the sun , for a short review see introduction of the paper @xcite .",
    "some authors argue that for the young sun ( @xmath0  myr ) relatively small fields , @xmath1  kg  @xcite and @xmath2  gauss  @xcite could survive , being relic fields captured from the primordial ones in the protostar plasma . for the sun at the present epoch there is an upper bound of @xmath3  mg near the tachocline obtained from the magnetic splitting of acoustic oscillations  @xcite .",
    "however , some authors have considered very strong magnetic fields in the rz , up to 30 mg  @xcite . here",
    "we suggest a new way to estimate the magnetic field strengths in the rz of the sun by relating them to the frequency shifts of g - mode candidates suggested by the first observations made with the golf ( global oscillations at low frequencies ) experiment  @xcite .",
    "we discuss some effects of rz magnetic fields which could explain the displacement of g - mode frequencies with respect to the theoretical frequencies calculated in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "indeed the existence of such shifts are hinted in golf s data . if eventually confirmed by further data , the idea that rz magnetic fields cause such frequency shifts would provide us with a useful tool to estimate their magnitude .    in order to find spectra of seismic waves accounting for the magnetic field in the rz a number of assumptions",
    "is required .",
    "for example :    1 .",
    "we consider ideal mhd neglecting both the heat conductivity and viscosity contributions to energy losses , as well as the ohmic dissipation .",
    "we linearize the mhd equations about a static background configuration , _",
    "i.e. _ a background configuration which is time independent and for which the background fluid velocity vanishes , @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   we assume the fluctuations to be adiabatic , with the contributions of fluctuations to the heat source vanishing : @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , we consider a fully ionized ideal gas , so that the thermodynamic quantity , first adiabatic exponent @xmath6 , is time independent and uniform . for numerical estimates",
    "we will take @xmath7 for hydrogen plasma .",
    "we adopt the cowling approximation , which amounts to the neglect of perturbations of the gravitational potential , ( i.e. : @xmath8 ) . 6 .",
    "we assume a rectangular geometry with cartesian coordinates : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath11 corresponds to the solar radial direction .",
    "the background quantities vary along the @xmath11 direction only ( which implies the local gravitational acceleration , @xmath12 , is directed along the @xmath11 axis , but in opposite direction ) .",
    "we also take a constant , uniform background magnetic field , @xmath13 , pointing along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the background mass - density profile is assumed to be exponential , @xmath14 $ ] , for constant @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium for the background then determine the profiles of thermodynamic quantities , and in particular imply @xmath17 is a constant .",
    "we assume that the frequency is zero in the convective zone ( cz ) and non - zero , but constant in the rz .    in what follows",
    ", we shall again specify the assumptions used , as they are needed , in order to keep clear which results rely on which assumptions .",
    "note that , deep within the radiative zone , the last approximation above holds to very good approximation for real mass - density profiles obtained by standard solar models , provided we identify the @xmath11 direction with the radial direction .",
    "the constancy of @xmath17 in this region is also expected since the highly - ionized plasma satisfies an ideal gas equation - of - state to good approximation . the rectangular geometry provides a reasonable approximation so long as we do not examine too close to the solar centre .",
    "what is important about our choice for @xmath13 is that it is slowly varying in the region of interest , and it is perpendicular to both @xmath12 and all background gradients , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , _ etc_.    as suggested in  @xcite such one - dimensional ( 1-d ) picture can be fully described in analytical terms in contrast to the 3-d case .",
    "there are two parameters which describe the spectra of magneto - gravity waves  @xcite : ( i ) strength of the background magnetic field @xmath20 and ( ii ) the dimensionless transversal wave number @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the density scale height and @xmath22 is the projection of the wavevector onto the x axis .",
    "let us estimate the value of the transversal wave number that could be relevant for the g - mode candidates observed on the photosphere .    since g - modes decay in the cz as @xmath23 , only modes with low transversal wave number @xmath24 ( long wave lengths )",
    "could be seen at the photosphere .",
    "this follows from the simple estimate for the longitudinal fluid velocity @xmath25 which is directed along the sun - earth line and causes the doppler shifts of optic lines registered by the golf experiment : @xmath26 this formula comes from eq .",

    "for instance , substituting for the magnetic field perturbation , @xmath32 , @xmath33 for the frequency in the rz , @xmath34  @xcite for the density scale height , one obtains @xmath35 , from which the estimate @xmath36 comes .",

    "subsection : b0 ] we derive the simplified master equation in the perturbative limit . in this limit",
    "there are no mhd ( slow or alfvn ) resonances within the sun , a situation which was treated in  @xcite .",
    "this perturbative method allows us to use a standard quantum mechanical 1-d approach to determine an exact analytical spectrum of g - modes in the presence of rz magnetic fields . in section  [ section : discussion ]",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "we describe the sun as an ideal hydrodynamical system characterized by nonlinear mhd equations .",
    "the mass conservation law for the total density @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 the total pressure @xmath38 is a sum of equilibrium , @xmath40 , and non - equilibrium , @xmath41 , parts , @xmath42 .",
    "since viscosity can be neglected , momentum is conserved according to @xmath43 here the total pressure @xmath44 consists of two terms : the equilibrium and non - equilibrium parts .",
    "the first is expressed as @xmath45 and obeys the equation @xmath46 .",
    "the non - equilibrium part of the total pressure @xmath47 involves non - linear terms coming from the total magnetic field @xmath48 .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field is governed by faraday s equation , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the compressibility of the gas .",
    "finally the conservation of entropy leads to the energy conservation law for an ideal plasma , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the total gas pressure .",
    "for definiteness here we consider the same generalized helioseismic model already proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , adopting an approximately rectangular rather than cylindrical , geometry . in this case",
    "it is convenient to choose a cartesian coordinate system whose z - axis is the `` radial''direction ; opposite to the local acceleration , @xmath53 . with this choice",
    "we take @xmath11 in the range @xmath54 , where @xmath55 represents the solar center and @xmath56 denotes the solar surface .",
    "the radiative zone corresponds to @xmath57 .",
    "the model assumes the background magnetic field to be directed along the x - axis @xmath58 , ensuring that physical gradients lie along the z - axis .",
    "such a field mimics both a toroidal field lying in the equatorial plane and a poloidal field perpendicular to the equatorial plane .",
    "we now linearize the above mhd equations ( [ mass]-[energy ] ) , so that all variables are split into background and fluctuating euler quantities , @xmath59 , with @xmath60 denoting small fluctuations about the background value @xmath61 . in what follows",
    "we also neglect rotation of the sun , so that the background velocity is zero , @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the mhd perturbations are independent of @xmath10 , which implies that @xmath63 , leaving just six perturbation functions , instead of eight .",
    "in addition , following @xcite , we consider plane waves propagating along the @xmath9-axis and therefore the dependence of all functions on the coordinates @xmath64 can be reduced to just @xmath65 , with @xmath66 being the phase velocity .",
    "this can be done since all functions depend only on the harmonic factor @xmath67 .    this way all perturbations are functions of two variables , @xmath68 , and the linearized mhd equations involve partial derivatives over @xmath69 and @xmath11 .",
    "notice that @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "let us rewrite the initial system for the six functions @xmath72 in eqs .",

    "second , the radial order @xmath121 should also be low , otherwise , such low frequency g - modes are much below the present experimental sensitivity .",
    "third , there is a strong influence of the rz magnetic field .",
    "if the magnetic field is too strong ( more than a few mg ) all g - modes are locked within the alfvn cavity ( see  @xcite ) , hence these g - modes decay far beneath the cz becoming invisible in the photosphere .",
    "this happens because the mhd energy in the radial direction is fully diverted to the transversal plane at the alfvn resonant layer position . on the other hand , for very small magnetic fields ( @xmath202 mg )",
    "the magnetic field effect is negligible and can not account for a possible discrepancy between present experimental data and theoretical predictions of seismic models .",
    "in contrast , we have shown that a solar radiative zone magnetic fields of intermediate magnitude , of the order 600 - 800  kg , can displace the pure g - mode frequencies by about 1% with respect to our model of seismic wave propagation , a value close to what is hinted by results of the golf experiment .",
    "we find that higher modes require a smaller magnetic field to produce a given g - mode frequency shift . however encouraging this result may sound , let us stress again that in our simple one - dimensional mhd picture ( with further assumptions , such as adiabatic oscillations , exponential density profile , constant gravity , etc ) we can only make a qualitative estimate of the magnetic field corrections to the pure g - mode spectrum .",
    "for example , our formalism can not explain the magnetic splitting of g - mode frequencies over azimuthal number @xmath203 , as it requires 3-d .",
    "further work in 3-d geometry is necessary to perform a quantitative comparison with the frequency patterns observed in the golf experiment @xcite . even within the simple analytic approach 1-d",
    "mhd model one may include viscosity effects in non - ideal plasma with finite conductivity , and also take into account magnetic field diffusion stabilizing mhd instabilities .",
    "last , but not least , recall that our perturbative analysis avoids the appearance of mhd resonances that could lead to density spikes .",
    "these are potentially important , as they can affect neutrino propagation through the solar rz  @xcite .",
    "improved determination of neutrino mixing parameters , e.g. by kamland  @xcite , allows one to carry out neutrino tomography in deep solar interior .",
    "both regimes of `` magnetized helioseismology '' ( i ) the mhd seismic models and ( ii ) the analysis of msw neutrino oscillations in noisy sun are complementary tools to explore rz magnetic fields .",
    "a fully quantitative analysis may require the inclusion of the differential rotation in the rz  @xcite as well as non - linearities .",
    ".2 cm    note added : as this paper was being typed , we saw a paper by @xcite ( astro - ph/0511472 ) , where a similar idea to probe the internal magnetic field of slowly pulsating b - stars through g modes is given .",
