    "star polymers , i.e. structures of polymer chains that are chemically linked with one end to a common core attain recently much attention both in theory , experiment , and technical applications @xcite . on the experimental side",
    "this is due to their effective interaction properties that interpolate between those of colloidal particles and single chain polymers . for theory and simulation",
    "they present the most simple albeit non - trivial examples of polymeric networks which , as shown by theory , provide all information to derive the scaling properties of general polymer networks . for this reason the scaling properties of stars of long flexible polymer chains in a good solvent are of central interest @xcite .",
    "the scaling of single long flexible polymer chains is perfectly described by a model of self - avoiding walks resulting in universal scaling exponents that only depend on the space dimension @xmath0 @xcite . however",
    ", the corresponding scaling exponents for star polymers will also depend on the number of arms @xmath1 constituting the star @xcite . building a polymer star from chains of different species one finds an even richer scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "the partition function of such a so - called copolymer star consisting of @xmath2 chains of species 1 and @xmath3 chains of species 2 ( each of the same size @xmath4 ) will show power law scaling in @xmath4 according to @xcite : @xmath5 with a family of copolymer star exponents @xmath6 for @xmath7 . in ( [ 1 ] )",
    "@xmath8 is a microscopic scale and a fugacity factor is omitted .",
    "we consider a species a of self- and mutually avoiding chains ( saw ) , species b and b@xmath9 of both self and mutually transparent chains ( rw ) and a species c of self - transparent but mutually avoiding chains ( maw ) .",
    "copolymer stars are built from one or more of these species with mutual avoidance between any two species .",
    "of special interest are the exponents of ( a ) homogeneous polymer stars @xmath10 , ( b ) symmetric and unsymmetric copolymer stars @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and ( c ) of stars of mutually avoiding walks @xmath13 .",
    "these exponents naturally arise when describing e.g. the scaling properties of the effective interaction of star polymers , the correlations of the vertices of a branched polymeric structure , the diffusion of particles near an absorbing polymer , and the transition of double stranded to single stranded dna @xcite .",
    "moreover , the star exponents @xmath14 uniquely define the scaling of copolymer networks of arbitrary but fixed topology @xcite . the above mentioned facts together with theoretical reasons ( e.g. the copolymer star exponents are related to the composite operators of polymer field theory and possess multifractal properties @xcite which seemingly is in contradiction with stability conditions @xcite ) explain the high interest in their analysis .",
    "currently , the field theoretical renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite is recognized as the most reliable analytic tool to calculate numerical values of scaling exponents in a systematic perturbative way . for the universality class of @xmath15-symmetric @xmath16 theory exponents",
    "are known up to high orders of perturbation theory : to the 5th order in @xmath17 expansion @xcite and to the 6th/7th order when calculated directly at fixed space dimension @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , the star exponents are known so far only to the 3rd order of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "a principal reason for this gap is that copolymer star exponents were introduced only recently @xcite and that these exponents have no direct counterparts in the theory of magnets .",
    "our main message is given by the analytic expressions for the copolymer star exponents that we obtained by state - of - the - art rg methods to @xmath19 accuracy in an @xmath20-expansion .",
    "this is merely one order below the best known @xmath20-expansion for the critical exponents of the @xmath21-vector model @xcite . when evaluated numerically @xcite by appropriate resummation techniques @xcite the expansions for the exponents lead to results in nice correspondence with the available exact ( 2d ) and mc data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the next , 2nd section introduces the main expressions relating the copolymer star exponents to polymer field theory , section [ iii ] presents the @xmath20-expansions for the three cases discussed above : @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the last section we conclude and discuss our results presenting a numerical estimate drawn from our expansions .",
    "details of our calculations along with numerical estimates of different quantities involving star exponents are the subject of a separate publication @xcite .",
    "here , we sketch the framework of polymer field theory suited to describe copolymer stars . the starting point is the edwards model @xcite generalized to describe a set of @xmath22 polymer chains in solution with self- and mutual- avoiding interactions @xmath23 . within this model ,",
    "the configuration of each chain @xmath24 is given by a path @xmath25 in @xmath0-dimensional space , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the so - called gaussian surface of the path @xmath25 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath28 of the model reads @xcite : @xmath29 with densities @xmath30 . in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , the first term describes the chain connectivity whereas the second one stands for the excluded volume interaction .",
    "the partition function of a star of @xmath22 polymer chains @xmath31 is calculated as a functional integral ( @xmath32 $ ] ) of the boltzmann distribution with the hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) over all possible configurations of the paths @xmath25 .",
    "a product of @xmath33-functions serves as a constraint ensuring all polymer chains to have a common endpoint : @xmath34 \\exp   \\ { -\\frac{1}{k_{\\rm b}t}{\\mathcal h}_{f_1f_2}({\\bf r}_a,\\{s_a\\})\\ }   \\prod_{a=2}^{f_1+f_2 } \\delta({\\bf r}_a(0 ) - { \\bf r}_1(0)).\\ ] ]    the mapping of the edwards model to a @xmath16 field theory with one coupling of @xmath15-symmetry in the limit @xmath35 is well established @xcite .",
    "the polymer system we are currently interested in is the so - called ternary polymer solution , where polymer chains of two species ( 1 and 2 ) are present .",
    "it is described by an edwards model ( [ 2 ] ) with three couplings @xcite : @xmath36 the partition function of the copolymer star ( [ 3 ] ) corresponds in the field theory to a vertex function with the insertion of a composite operator @xmath37 of a special symmetry @xcite .",
    "ultraviolet divergences occur when the bare vertex functions are evaluated naively @xcite .",
    "we apply the field theoretical rg approach @xcite to remove the divergences and to study the scaling properties of the vertex functions of copolymer stars .",
    "since the theory is renormalizable one can collect all divergences in the so - called renormalization factors @xmath38 and define a finite theory with renormalized parameters preserving the structure of the original one .",
    "the renormalized couplings @xmath39 and the renormalization factors @xmath38 depend on the parameter @xmath40 which gives the scale of the external momenta in the renormalization procedure .",
    "this dependence is expressed by rg functions defined by the following relations : @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , @xmath42 stands for the @xmath38-factor renormalizing the vertex function of a composite operator , which corresponds to the copolymer star partition function ( [ 3 ] ) . in the fixed points of the rg transformation , given by a common zero of the @xmath43-functions ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) the anomalous dimensions @xmath6 of the composite operators define the set of exponents for copolymer stars .",
    "explicit expressions for the star exponents will be given in the next section .",
    "the zeros of the @xmath43-functions ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) correspond to the fixed points of the theory . to clarify their physical significance",
    "we here refer to the three classes of species a , b , and c introduced above and denote nontrivial values by @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the fixed points of ( [ 5 ] ) are @xmath47 for species a , @xmath48 for species b and c. the non - trivial fixed points of ( [ 6 ] ) are @xmath49 for the combination of species b , b@xmath9 and for the interchain interaction of species c and finally @xmath50 for the combination of species a and b @xcite . analyzing the fixed point structure , one",
    "is led basically to the following physically different situations : in the first case we combine species b and b@xmath9 i.e. both sets of @xmath2 polymer chains of species b and of @xmath3 polymer chains of species b@xmath9 are non - selfinteracting rws , but mutually avoid each other ( we refer to this as to the case  @xmath51 \" ) . in the second case , ",
    "@xmath52 \" , the species a selfinteract ( @xmath2 saws ) and the species b do not ( @xmath3 rws ) . in the third case ,  @xmath53 \" , only species c of @xmath54 mutually avoiding rws is present . in our calculations",
    "we use the dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction scheme @xcite .",
    "most of the star graphs could be derived from the four - point diagrams of the @xmath16 theory . at the four loop level , however , we encountered a number of independent star graphs , which we evaluated following the r@xmath55-operation scheme @xcite .",
    "details of our calculations will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
