    "the investigation of the heavy quarks production in the high energy hadron processes provides a method for studying the internal structure of hadrons .",
    "realistic estimates of the cross section of the heavy quark production as well as their correlations are necessary in order to plan experiments on existing and future accelerators .",
    "these predictions are obtained usually in the parton model framework and depend significantly on the quark and gluon structure functions .",
    "the last ones are more or less known experimentally from the data of hera , but unknown at the very small values of bjorken variable @xmath2 .",
    "however it is just the region that dominates in the heavy quark production at the high energies .",
    "the gribov - lipatov - dokshitzer - altarelli - parisi ( gldap ) evolution equation is applied usually to calculate the structure functions .",
    "it sums up in the leading logarithm approximation ( lla ) all the qcd diagram contributions proportional to @xmath3 , but it does not take into account the terms proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "that is why this approximation does not give the correct asymptotic behaviour of the structure function in the small @xmath5 region .",
    "for the correct description of these phenomena not only the terms of the form @xmath3 have to be collected in the feynman diagrams but also the terms @xmath4 .",
    "another problem that appears at @xmath6 is that of the absorption ( screening ) corrections which must stop the increase of the cross section at @xmath7 in accordance with the unitarity condition .",
    "it can be interpreted as the saturation of parton density .",
    "for relatively small virtuality @xmath8 the gluon structure function behaves as @xmath9 , so the cross section for the interaction of the point - like parton with a target , @xmath10 , obeys the unitarity condition .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 can be treated as a new infrared - cutoff parameter which plays the role of the typical transverse momentum of partons in the parton cascade of the hadron in semihard processes .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath12 was discussed in ref.[6 ] .",
    "it increases with @xmath13 and the values of @xmath12 are about 2 - 4 gev at @xmath14 .    the predictions for the cross section of the heavy quark pair production",
    "are based usually on the parton model calculations [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "all particles are assumed in this model to be on mass shell with the longitudinal component of the momentum only ( so called collinear approximation ) , and the cross section is averaged over two transverse polarizations of the gluons .",
    "the virtualities @xmath15 of the initial partons are taken into account only through their densities .",
    "the latter are calculated in lla through gldap evolution equation .",
    "the probabilistic picture of noninteracting partons underlies this way of proceeding . in the region , where the transverse mass @xmath16 of the produced heavy quark is close to @xmath12 , the dependence of the amplitude of the subprocess @xmath17 , dominating at the high energy , on the virtualities and polarizations of the gluons",
    "becomes important .",
    "the amplitudes of these subprocesses should be calculated more accurately than in the parton model .",
    "the matrix elements of the qcd subprocesses accounting for the virtualities and polarizations of the gluons are very complicated .",
    "we presented them in our previous paper [ 4 ] for the main and simplest subprocesses , @xmath18 for hadroproduction and @xmath19 for photo- and electroproduction .",
    "the contributions of high - order subprocesses can be essential , but our aim is to discuss the qualitative difference between our results and the parton model predictions .",
    "this can be done on the level of the low - order diagrams .    in this paper",
    "we calculate in the same order ( @xmath20 ) the azimutal correlations of the heavy quarks produced in hadron - hadron collisions which are in serious disagreement with the conventional parton model predictions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the cross section of heavy quark hadroproduction is given schematically by the diagrams in fig.1 .",
    "the main contribution to the cross section at small @xmath5 is known to come from the gluons .",
    "the lower and upper ladder blocks represent the two - dimensional gluon distributions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which are the functions of the longitudinal momentum fraction ( @xmath5 and @xmath23 ) of the initial hadron and the virtuality of the gluon . their distribution over @xmath5 and transverse momenta @xmath24 in hadron is given in semihard theory @xcite by the function @xmath25 .",
    "it differs from the usual function @xmath26 : @xmath27 such a definition of @xmath25 enables to treat correctly the effects arising from the gluon virtualities .",
    "the exact expression for this function can be obtained as a solution of the evolution equation which , contrary to the parton model case , is nonlinear due to interactions between the partons in the small @xmath5 region .    in what follows we use sudakov decomposition for the quark momenta @xmath28 through the momenta of the colliding hadrons @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the transverse ones @xmath31 : @xmath32 the differential cross sections of heavy quarks hadroproduction have the form : to be equal to the gluon virtuality , which is very close to the blm scheme@xcite ; ( see also @xcite ) . ]",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 here @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the gluon transverse momenta and @xmath37 are the quark rapidities in the hadron - hadron c.m.s .",
    "frame , @xmath38 @xmath39 is the square of the matrix element for the heavy quark pair hadroproduction .    in lla kinematics",
    "@xmath40 so @xmath41 ( the more accurate relations are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , but we are working in the kinematics , where @xmath44 ) .",
    "the matrix element @xmath45 is calculated in the born order of qcd without standart simplifications of the parton model , since in the small @xmath5 domain there are no grounds for neglecting the transverse momenta of the gluons @xmath46 and @xmath47 in comparision with the quark mass and the parameter @xmath12 . in the axial gauge @xmath48 the gluon propagator takes the form @xmath49 @xmath50 for the gluons in @xmath51channel the main contribution comes from the so called nonsense polarization @xmath52 , which can be picked out by decomposing the numerator into the longitudinal and the transverse parts : @xmath53",
    "the other contributions are suppressed by the powers of @xmath54 .",
    "since the sum of the diagrams in fig.1a-1c is gauge invariant in the lla , the transversality condition for the ends of gluon line enables one to replace @xmath55 by @xmath56 in the expression for @xmath52 .",
    "thus we get @xmath57 or @xmath58 if we do such a trick for the vector @xmath59 too .",
    "both these equations for @xmath60 can be used , but for the form ( [ trans1 ] ) one has to modify slightly the gluon vertex ( to account for the several ways of gluon emission  see ref .",
    "@xmath61.\\ ] ] as a result the colliding gluons can be treated as aligned ones and their polarization vectors are directed along the transverse momenta .",
    "ultimately , the nontrivial azimuthal correlations must arise between the transverse momenta @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the heavy quarks .",
    "formally , one looses the gauge invariance dealing with off mass shell gluons ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "indeed , the new graphs similar to the bremsstruhlung from the initial ( final ) quark line ( fig.1d ) may contribute to the central plato rapidity region in the covariant feynman gauge .",
    "however this is not the fact .",
    "the function @xmath65 collects with the `` semihard '' accuracy all terms of the form @xmath66 with @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the triple gluon vertex ( 11 ) includes effectively all the main ( leading logarithmic ) contributions of the type of fig.1d @xcite .",
    "for example , the upper part of the graph shown in fig.1d corresponds in terms of the bfkl equation to the t - channel gluon reggeization .",
    "therefore the final expression is gauge invariant with the logarithmic accuracy .",
    "although the situation considered here seems to be quite opposite to the parton model , there is a certain limit in which our formulae can be transformed into the parton model ones .",
    "consider the @xmath0 case and assume that the characteristic values of quark momenta @xmath62 and @xmath63 are much larger than the values of gluon momenta , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and one can keep only the lowest powers of @xmath70 .",
    "it means that we can put @xmath71 everywhere in the matrix element @xmath45 except the vertices .",
    "introducing the polar coordinates @xmath72 ( and the same for @xmath47 ) and performing angular integration with the help of the formula @xmath73 we obtain @xmath74 here @xmath75 is just the parton model matrix element , since the result is the same as that calculated for the real ( mass shell ) gluons and averaged over transverse polarizations . then we obtain the cross section ( [ spp ] ) in the form [ 2 , 3 ] : @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the mass square of @xmath80 pair .    on the other hand , the assumption ( [ par1 ] ) is not fulfilled in a more or less realistic case .",
    "the transverse momenta of produced quarks as well as the gluon virtualities ( qcd scale values ) should be of the order of heavy quark masses .",
    "eq.(3 ) enables to calculate straightforwardly the distributions over the azimutal angle @xmath81 , which is defined as the opening angle between the two produced heavy quarks projected onto a plane perpendicular to the beam .",
    "let us define this plane as @xmath82-plane and let the first heavy quark flights to the @xmath5 direction , i.e. @xmath83 , @xmath84 . in this case @xmath85 , and it is not a problem to evaluate the distribution over @xmath81 integrating eq.(3 ) using , say , vegas code .",
    "since the functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 are unknown at the small values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we rewrite the integrals in eq.(3 ) as @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 where eq.([xg ] ) is used should not be mixed with the function @xmath93 discussed in the introduction . ] .",
    "thus , we obtain the sum of the three different contributions : the product of two first terms with @xmath94 in the r.h.s . of eq.(17 ) , @xmath95 ; the sum of the products of first and second terms , @xmath96 ; and , finally , the product of second terms , @xmath97 .",
    "the first contribution , @xmath95 , is very similar to the conventional lo parton model expression , in which the total heavy quark momenta is exactly zero and the angle between quarks is always @xmath98 .",
    "however the angle between two heavy hadrons can be sligtly different from this value due to a hadronization process . to take it into account we assume that in the first contribution , where quarks are produced back - to - back , the probability to find the final azimutal angle @xmath81 , @xmath99 is determined by the expression @xmath100 where @xmath101 = 0.2 gev / c and @xmath102 is the transverse momentum in the azimutal plane of the hadron coming from hadronization process .",
    "the two last contributions , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , result in a more or less broad distribution over the angle between the produced quarks , so we neglect here their small modification in the hadronization .",
    "it is necessary to repeat that our approach is justified only at small @xmath5 , that is at the high enough initial energies .",
    "unfortunately , the highest energy , where the experimental data on the charm azimutal correlations exist , is only @xmath103 = 39 gev @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 in eq.(3 ) , giving an essential contributions to the charm production cross section , are not large enough at this energy , so the first contribution in eq.(17 ) dominates at the not very small @xmath106 value and our predictions coincide practically with the results of lo parton model .    at the higher energies the second and third contributions become large enough and lead to some difference with the conventional parton model .",
    "the predictions of charm pair azimutal correlations at @xmath103 = 1800 gev and @xmath106 = 4 gev@xmath107 are presented in fig.2a .",
    "the solid hystogram shows the results for all produced charm particles .",
    "however in this case some hadronization mechanism can contribute to the azimutal correlations of the charmed hadrons with the small relative momenta . to decrease this possible contribution",
    "the dashed histogram presents the same results for the events , where both charmed hadrons have the transverse momenta @xmath108 , @xmath109 = 4 gev / c .",
    "the same results at the energy @xmath103 = 14 tev are shown in fig.2b .",
    "note that the predicted azimutal correlations have some energy dependence , they become more broad , when the initial energy increases , however this energy dependence is weak enough , especially at @xmath109 = 0 .",
    "our @xmath81-distributions seem to be more broad than the results of parton model calculations .    the similar predictions for the beauty pair",
    "azimutal correlations at the energies @xmath103 = 1800 gev and 14 tev are presented in fig.3 for the two values of @xmath109 , 0 and 8 gev / c .",
    "for both these @xmath109 values the distributions become more broad with the energy increase .    contrary to the parton model results , we predict two peaks for all cases , the standard one at @xmath110 and the second peak with the smaller altitude , at @xmath111 , originated from the contribution of the diagram fig.1c .",
    "the hera experimental data on @xmath112 at the small x , actually @xmath113 , show the singular @xmath5-behaviour at the moderate @xmath114 ( say , @xmath115 gev@xmath107 ) .",
    "both zeus @xcite as well as h1 @xcite coll .",
    "data can be parametrized as @xmath116 with @xmath117 .",
    "such a behaviour at @xmath118 is in evident contradiction with the unitarity and has to be stopped by a shadow mechanism @xcite .    to see the possible influence of the shadow effects on the azimutal correlations",
    "we make the simplest assumption that the shadowing modifies the gluon distribution in such a way that the real distribution can be written as @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the bare grv ( ho ) gluon distribution @xcite . both @xmath122 and @xmath121 distributions",
    "are shown in fig.4 for the value @xmath123 .",
    "one can see that the difference between them at the smallest @xmath5 , where the data exist ( @xmath124 ) , is about 10 % .",
    "the calculated results for the azimutal correlations of the heavy flavour pairs with `` shadowed '' gluon distributions , eq.(20 ) , are presented in fig.5 and show that the shadowing does not significantly affect our results .",
    "the above discussion shows that the accounting for the virtual nature of the interacting gluons as well as their transverse motion and different polarizations results in the qualitative discrepances with the parton model predictions .",
    "using , say , lo qcd formulae we obtain a considerably more broad distribution over the angle between two heavy flavours than the convenient nlo parton model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is that the nlo parton model allows the discussed distributions to differ from @xmath125-functions only due to the emission of one hard gluon .",
    "our approach , to the contrary , incorporates effectively the emission of all evolution gluons via the phenomenological gluon distribution .",
    "low order qcd diagrams for the heavy quark production in @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) collisions via gluon - gluon fusion ( a - c ) and the diagram ( d ) violating formally the gauge invariance , which is restored , however , with logarithmic accuracy .",
