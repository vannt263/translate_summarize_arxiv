    "in the recent years , the group of m. fink developed an experimental technique called time reversal mirror ( trm ) @xcite that allows time reversal of ultrasonic waves .",
    "an ultrasonic pulse is emitted from the inside of the control region ( called cavity ) and the excitation is detected as it escapes through a set of transducers placed at the boundaries .",
    "these transducers can act alternatively like microphones or loudspeakers and the registered signal is played back in the time reversed sequence .",
    "thus , the signal focalizes in space and time in the source point forming a loschmidt echo @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the quality of focalization gets better by increasing the inhomogeneities inside the cavity .",
    "this property allows for applications in many fields @xcite . in order to have a first formal description for the exact reversion",
    ", we introduced a time reversal procedure denoted perfect inverse filter ( pif ) in the quantum domain @xcite .",
    "the pif is based in the injection of a wave function that precisely compensates the feedback effects by means of the renormalization of the registered signal in the frequency domain .",
    "this also accounts for the correlations between the transducers .",
    "recently , we proved that these concepts apply for classical waves @xcite .",
    "we applied it to the numerical evaluation of the reversal of excitations in a linear chain of classical coupled harmonic oscillators with satisfactory results .",
    "a key issue in assessing the stability of the reversal procedure is have a numerical integrator that is stable and perfectly reversible .",
    "therefore , we developed a numerical algorithm , the pair partitioning method ( pp ) , that allowed the precise test of the reversal procedure . in the next section",
    "we develop the main idea of the method and then we use it to obtain the numerical results that we compare with the analytical solution for the homogeneous system . additionally , we introduce a method to approximate the solution of an infinite system using a finite one . for this",
    "we introduce a non - homogeneous fictitious friction term that can simulate the diffusion of the excitation occurring in an unbounded system .",
    "these strategies are tested through a numerical simulation of a time reversal experiment .",
    "the system to be used is shown in the figure [ fig_scheme ] : a one - dimensional chain of @xmath0 coupled oscillators with masses @xmath1 and natural frequencies @xmath2 that can be represented as a set of coupled pendulums .",
    "coupled oscillators system to be solved by the pp numerical method . ]    if @xmath3 denotes the impulse and @xmath4 the displacement amplitude from the equilibrium position for the @xmath5th oscillator , the hamiltonian writes @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the elastic coefficient that accounts for the coupling between the oscillators @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "notice that we could rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of each coupling separating it in non - interacting terms including even pairs and odd pairs each : @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 a good approximation to the overall dynamics , inspired in the trotter method used in quantum mechanics @xcite , can be obtained solving analytically the equations of motion for each independent hamiltonian in a time step @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the pair @xmath13 has @xmath14 at each small time step @xmath12 , the evolution for the even couplings is obtained and the resulting positions and velocities are used as initial conditions for the set of hamiltonians accounting for odd couplings and so on . since the equations of motion are solved separately , we could consider only the two coupled oscillators system , e.g. @xmath15 for this system , it is easy to obtain the corresponding normal modes @xmath16 with characteristic frequencies @xmath17 from ( [ eq_normal ] ) , @xmath18 are obtained and these values are used for the evolution after the temporal step @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 once we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 we can go back to the natural basis by means of the inverse of ( [ eq_normal ] ) @xmath23 then , one obtains the displacements and momenta for all oscillators at time @xmath24 .",
    "the above steps are summarized in the pair partitioning algorithm :    1 .",
    "determine all the masses and natural frequencies of the partitioned system @xmath25 .",
    "2 .   for even couplings",
    "@xmath26 , rewrite the initial conditions @xmath27 for the normal modes according to ( [ eq_normal ] ) .",
    "3 .   calculate the normal modes evolution for even couplings , according to ( [ eq_evnorm ] ) and obtain @xmath28 from ( [ eq_inv ] ) .",
    "4 .   calculate the normal modes for odd couplings @xmath29 , using the recent positions and velocities .",
    "calculate the normal modes evolution for odd couplings and give the positions and velocities @xmath30 .",
    "go back to the step 2 with @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , applying @xmath31 times the pp algorithm we obtain the positions and velocities for all oscillators at time @xmath32 . + as an example we consider the homogeneous system where the @xmath33 oscillators have identical masses and the only natural frequencies correspond to the surface @xmath34 .",
    "the displacement amplitude of the @xmath5th oscillator due to an initial displacement in the @xmath35th oscillator can be expressed analytically as @xmath36 with @xmath37 the characteristic frequency for the @xmath38th normal mode . in the figure",
    "[ fig_ordered ] the analytical and numerical results are compared for the surface oscillator displacement in a case when all the oscillators were initially in their equilibrium positions except @xmath39 .",
    "we use @xmath40 in two cases where the temporal steps are @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we have taken @xmath33 such that no mesoscopics echoes @xcite appear in the interval of time shown .",
    "we also notice that the error @xmath43 drops as the temporal step @xmath12 diminishes .",
    "we observe a quadratic dependence @xmath44 in complete analogy with the trotter method . in the particular case of the homogeneous system",
    "we have @xmath45 .",
    "the solution of wave dynamics in infinite media remains as a delicate problem .",
    "in such case , the initially localized excitation spreads through the systems in a way that resembles actual dissipation .",
    "in contrast , finite systems present periodic revivals , the mesoscopic echoes , that show that energy remains in the system . in order",
    "to get rid the mesoscopic echoes and obtaining a form of dissipation  using a finite number of oscillators , we add a fictitious friction  term .",
    "the friction coefficients @xmath46 can be included between the @xmath47th and @xmath48th steps of the pp algorithm supposing that the displacement amplitude decays exponentially @xmath49 as occurs in a damped oscillator in the limit @xmath50 .",
    "for the homogeneous system with @xmath51 oscillators were the cavity ending at site @xmath52 we choose a progressive increase in the damping as @xmath53 we compare the result of this approximation with the undamped case for the displacement amplitude in @xmath54 .",
    "the figure [ fig_mesosc ] shows how the dynamics in the damped system has no mesoscopic echoes whereas in the undamped system we observe the echo at @xmath55 .    .",
    "]    as we will see for trm and pif procedures , this last result is very usefull since it allows to obtain the dynamics of an open system with a small number of oscillators ( e.g. @xmath56 ) .",
    "as we mentioned above , the time reversal mirror procedure consists in the injection , at the boundaries of the cavity , of a signal proportional to that recorded during the forward propagation .",
    "in contrast , the perfect inverse filter corrects this recorded signal to accounts for the contributions of multiple reflections and normal dispersion of the previously injected signal in a manner that their instantaneous total sum coincides precisely with the time reversed signal at the boundaries .",
    "the continuity of the wave equation ensures that perfect time reversal occurs at every point inside the cavity .",
    "the procedure for such correction is described somewhere else @xcite . here",
    ", it is enough to notice that the imposition of an appropriate wave amplitude at the boundaries should give the perfect reversal of an excitation originally localized inside the cavity .",
    "an example of such situation would be a  surface pendulum  coupled to a semi - infinite linear chain of harmonically coupled masses @xcite . in such a case , we know that the energy decays in a approximately exponential way , where the decay rate can be assimilated to a friction coefficient",
    ". however , for very short times , the local energy decays with a quadratic law while for very long times the exponential decay gives rise to a power law characteristic of the slow diffusion of the energy @xcite . in the figure [ fig_recovering ]",
    "we show how this overall decay is reversed by controling the amplitude at site @xmath54 .    .",
    "evolution ( blue ) for the displacement amplitude @xmath57 . ]",
    "as long as we have been able to wait until a neglegible amount of energy is left in the cavity , the control of the boundaries is enough to reverse the whole dynamics inside the cavity . as a comparison",
    ", the theoretical reversal of the decay of a surface excitation in a semi - infinite chain is shown .",
    "we see that the region they differ is when the injected signal is still negligible as compared to the energy still remaining in the cavity ( as a concequence of the very slow power law decay ) .",
    "we have presented a numerical strategy for the solution of the wave equation that is completely time reversible .",
    "this involves the iterative application of the exact evolution of pairs of coupled effective oscillators where the energy is conserved , hence deserving the name of pair partitioning method .",
    "this is complemented with an original strategy for dealing with wave propagation through infinite media .",
    "while various tests of these procedures remain to be done , we have shown , through the solution of simple but highly non - trivial examples , that the method is numerically stable and can be used to revert wave dynamics up to a desired precision .",
