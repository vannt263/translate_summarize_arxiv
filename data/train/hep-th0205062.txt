    "[ 3intro ] recently a lot of work on quantum einstein gravity ( qeg ) went into constructing an appropriate exact renormalization group ( rg ) equation @xcite , finding approximate solutions to it @xcite , and exploring their implications for black hole physics @xcite and cosmology @xcite .",
    "in particular , strong indications were found that qeg might be nonperturbatively renormalizable .",
    "if so , it could have the status of a fundamental , microscopic quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the basic tool used in these investigations is the effective average action and its exact rg equation @xcite .",
    "it is a continuum analog of wilson s lattice renormalization group of iterated block spin transformations @xcite .",
    "both in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics the idea is to integrate out all fluctuation modes which have momenta larger than a certain infrared ( ir ) cutoff @xmath2 ( `` fast degrees of freedom '' ) , and to take account of those modes in an implicit way by the modified dynamics which they induce for the remaining fluctuations with momenta smaller than @xmath2 ( the `` slow degrees of freedom '' ) . in field theory this `` renormalized '' dynamics is encoded in a scale dependent effective action , @xmath3 , whose dependence on the cutoff scale @xmath2 is governed by a functional differential equation referred to as the `` exact rg equation '' @xcite .",
    "this equation gives rise to a flow on the space of all actions ( `` theory space '' ) .",
    "the functional @xmath3 defines an effective field theory valid near the scale @xmath2 ; evaluated at tree level , it describes all loop effects due to the high - momentum modes .",
    "the effective average action can be thought of as a kind of microscope with a variable resolution . at large @xmath2 , the physics at short distances",
    "@xmath4 can be read off directly from @xmath3 ; at small @xmath2 we see a coarse - grained picture suitable for a simple description of structures with a large characteristic length scale @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the effective average action @xmath3 , regarded as a function of @xmath2 , interpolates between the ordinary effective action @xmath5 and the bare ( classical ) action @xmath6 which is approached for @xmath7 .",
    "the construction of @xmath3 begins by adding a ir cutoff term @xmath8 to the classical action entering the standard euclidean functional integral for the generating functional @xmath9 of the connected green s functions .",
    "the new piece @xmath8 introduces a momentum dependent @xmath10-term @xmath11 for each mode of the quantum field with momentum @xmath12 . for @xmath13 , the cutoff function @xmath11",
    "is assumed to vanish so that the high - momentum modes get integrated out unsuppressed . for @xmath14",
    ", it behaves as @xmath15 ; hence the small - momentum modes are suppressed in the path integral by a mass term @xmath16 .",
    "apart from a correction term which is known explicitly @xcite , the effective average action @xmath3 is given by the legendre transform of the modified generating functional @xmath17 .    from this definition",
    "one can derive the exact rg equation obeyed by @xmath3 . in a slightly symbolic notation it is of the form @xmath18\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the rhs of this equation is a kind of `` beta - functional '' which summarizes the beta - functions for infinitely many running couplings .",
    "geometrically , it defines a vector field on theory space , the corresponding flow lines being the rg trajectories @xmath19 .",
    "the functional @xmath3 enters this vector field via its hessian @xmath20 , i.e. the infinite - dimensional matrix of all second functional derivatives of @xmath3 with respect to the dynamical , i.e. , non - background fields .    in eq .",
    "( [ 3in1 ] ) the c - number argument of @xmath21 is replaced with the operator @xmath22 .",
    "the discrimination of high-``momentum '' vs. low-``momentum '' modes is performed according to the spectrum of this operator , i.e. @xmath23 is an eigenvalue of @xmath22 . in simple theories where no gauge or diffeomorphism invariance needs to be respected , @xmath24 is the free laplacian , @xmath25 , whose eigenmodes are momentum eigenstates in the usual sense of the word . in yang - mills",
    "theory @xcite it has proven convenient to use the background field formalism @xcite and to set @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the covariant derivative in the background field . the background field technique plays a dual role in this context .",
    "using a background gauge fixing term makes @xmath3 a gauge invariant functional of its argument , and using @xmath27 in the cutoff leads to a flow equation of the relatively simple type ( [ 3in1 ] ) , similar to non - gauge theories .",
    "( the rg equation resulting from @xmath28 with @xmath29 constructed from the _ dynamical _ gauge field is quite unwieldy . )    along similar lines an effective average action for @xmath30-dimensional euclidean qeg has been constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the corresponding flow equation has been derived . leaving the faddeev - popov ghosts aside for a moment ,",
    "the gravitational effective average action , @xmath31 $ ] , is a functional of two different metrics , the `` ordinary '' dynamical metric @xmath32 and the background metric @xmath33 .",
    "the usual effective action @xmath34 $ ] is recovered by taking the limit @xmath35 of the functional @xmath36\\equiv\\gamma_k[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\bar{g}_{\\mu\\nu}=g_{\\mu\\nu}]$ ] in which the two metrics are taken equal .",
    "thanks to the background gauge fixing condition this construction leads to a functional @xmath36 $ ] which is invariant under general coordinate transformations .",
    "one of the many advantages which the exact rg approach has in comparison to the standard canonical or path integral quantization is that it offers a very natural and intuitive nonperturbative approximation scheme . by truncating the theory space",
    "one can obtain approximate solutions to the rg equation which do not need a small expansion parameter .",
    "the idea is to project the rg flow from the `` huge '' infinite - dimensional space of all actions onto some smaller , typically finite dimensional subspace which is easier to handle . in this way",
    "the functional rg equation for @xmath3 becomes a system of ordinary differential equations for a ( finite ) set of coupling constants which have the geometrical interpretation of coordinates on the subspace .",
    "it is clear that in applying this strategy the key problem is finding the `` relevant '' subspace which contains the essential physics .    in a first attempt at solving the gravitational rg equation @xcite",
    "the flow has been projected onto the 2-dimensional subspace of theory space which is spanned by the invariants @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this is the so - called einstein - hilbert truncation defined by the ansatz @xmath39=\\left(16\\pi",
    "g_k\\right)^{-1}\\int d^dx\\,\\sqrt{g}\\left\\ { -r(g)+2\\bar{\\lambda}_k\\right\\}+\\mbox{classical gauge fixing}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two running couplings involved are the running newton constant @xmath40 and the running cosmological constant @xmath41 .",
    "the similarity of ( [ 3in2 ] ) to the action of classical general relativity is accidental in a sense ; improved truncations would include both higher powers of the curvature and nonlocal terms @xcite . in ( [ 3in2 ] )",
    "only the gauge fixing term depends on @xmath33 ; it vanishes when we set @xmath42 .",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath40 and @xmath41 is most conveniently visualized as a flow in the @xmath43-@xmath44plane where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the dimensionless newton constant and cosmological constant , respectively . using the original cutoff of `` type a '' @xcite the system of equations for @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "was derived in @xcite and solved numerically in @xcite . in @xcite a new cutoff of `` type b '' was introduced and the corresponding flow equations in the einstein - hilbert truncation were derived .",
    "( the `` type b '' cutoff is convenient if one uses the tt - decomposition of the metric @xcite . )",
    "the fixed point properties of these equations were first discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and analyzed in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one finds that the rg flow in the @xmath43-@xmath44plane is governed by two fixed points @xmath49 : a trivial or `` gaussian '' fixed point at @xmath50 , and a non - gaussian fixed point with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    in order to appreciate the importance of the non - gaussian fixed point we recall what it means to `` quantize '' a theory in the average action approach .",
    "one picks a bare action @xmath6 and imposes the initial condition @xmath53 at the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff scale @xmath54 , uses the rg equation to find @xmath3 at all lower scales @xmath55 , and finally sends @xmath35 and @xmath56 .",
    "a _ fundamental _ theory has the property that the `` continuum '' limit @xmath56 actually exists after redefining only finitely many parameters in the action .",
    "this is the case in perturbatively renormalizable theories @xcite , but there are also examples of perturbatively nonrenormalizable theories which possess a limit @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the continuum limit of those `` nonperturbatively renormalizable '' theories is taken at a non - gaussian fixed point , i.e. the theory is defined by the set of rg trajectories which leave the fixed point when we lower @xmath2 .",
    "these trajectories span the uv critical hypersurface of the fixed point , @xmath57 .",
    "if it is finite dimensional , the quantum theory thus constructed has only finitely many free parameters and therefore keeps its predictive power even at arbitrarily large momentum scales .",
    "this behavior is to be contrasted with an _ effective _ field theory which , at high energies , typically contains an increasing number of free parameters which must be taken from the experiment .    in his `` asymptotic safety '' scenario weinberg",
    "@xcite conjectured that a fundamental quantum field theory of gravity could perhaps be constructed nonperturbatively by taking the continuum limit at a non - gaussian fixed point @xcite .",
    "while originally this idea could be implemented in @xmath58 dimensions only , the recent results coming from the effective average action strongly support the hypothesis that this fixed point exists also in 4 dimensions . within the einstein - hilbert truncation ,",
    "the existence of a suitable non - gaussian fixed point is definitely established by now ; the crucial question is whether it is the projection of a fixed point present in the exact theory or merely an artifact of the approximation .",
    "let us assume for a moment that the fixed point indeed exists in the exact 4-dimensional theory and that we define qeg by taking the @xmath56 limit there .",
    "then , since @xmath59 approaches @xmath60 for @xmath7 , the dimensionful couplings behave as @xmath61 for large @xmath2 .",
    "obviously @xmath40 vanishes for @xmath7 .",
    "at least as far as this coupling is concerned qeg is asymptotically free similar to yang - mills theory .",
    "the @xmath62-dependence of the running newton constant will lead to a characteristic momentum dependence of the cross sections for graviton - graviton scattering and graviton mediated matter - matter scattering . because of this characteristic momentum dependence , qeg could be distinguished experimentally from alternative theories of quantum gravity such as string theory , at least in principle .",
    "let us generalize the standard definition of the planck mass , @xmath63 , and introduce the _ running planck mass _ @xmath64 at the laboratory scale @xmath65 reduces to @xmath66 , most probably , and its dependence on @xmath2 is negligible .",
    "however , in the fixed point regime @xmath7 , the asymptotic freedom of @xmath40 implies that @xmath65 is proportional to the scale @xmath2 itself : @xmath67 .",
    "this shows that the running planck mass is a rather elusive `` barrier '' which never can be jumped across in any experiment .",
    "if we analyze a system with a probe of increasing momentum @xmath2 we will always push the running planck mass ahead of us and never reach it .    also the standard constant planck mass ,",
    "defined more precisely in terms of the ir value of @xmath40 , @xmath68^{-1/2}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plays an important role in qeg , similar to that of @xmath69 in qcd . according to the numerical solutions of the @xmath43-@xmath70-system @xcite , @xmath66 marks the lower boundary of the asymptotic scaling region .",
    "near @xmath71 there is a crossover from the scaling laws ( [ 3in3 ] ) of the non - gaussian fixed point to those of the gaussian fixed point .        according to the uv scaling laws ( [ 3in3 ] )",
    "the dimensionful cosmological constant diverges for @xmath7 proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "this has an interesting geometrical interpretation .",
    "let us consider the @xmath2-dependent , effective field equations implied by the truncation ansatz ( [ 3in2 ] ) with @xmath42 for @xmath73 .",
    "they happen to coincide with the familiar vacuum einstein equations with the cosmological constant replaced by the scale - dependent quantity @xmath41 : @xmath74 since @xmath41 is the only quantity which sets a scale , every solution to ( [ 3in6 ] ) has a typical radius of curvature @xmath75 .",
    "( for instance , the maximally symmetric @xmath76-solution has the radius @xmath77 . ) the @xmath2-dependence of the solutions and in particular of @xmath78 should be interpreted as follows .",
    "if we want to explore the spacetime structure at a fixed length scale @xmath79 it is most convenient to use the action @xmath36 $ ] at @xmath80 because for this , and only this , functional a _ tree level _",
    "analysis is sufficient to describe the essential physics at this scale , including all quantum effects .",
    "hence , when we observe spacetime with a `` microscope '' of resolution @xmath81 , we will see an average radius of curvature given by @xmath82 .",
    "once @xmath81 is smaller than the ( standard ) planck length @xmath83 we are in the fixed point regime ( [ 3in3 ] ) so that @xmath84 , or @xmath85 thus , when we look at the structure of spacetime with a microscope of resolution @xmath81 , the average radius of curvature which we measure is proportional to the resolution itself",
    ". if we want to probe finer details and decrease @xmath81 we automatically decrease @xmath78 and hence _ in_crease the average curvature .",
    "spacetime seems to be more strongly curved at small distances than at larger ones .",
    "the scale - free relation ( [ 3in7 ] ) suggests that at distances below the planck length quantum spacetime is a kind of fractal with a self - similar structure .",
    "it has no intrinsic scale .    before we continue",
    "a remark might be in order on which theory precisely we refer to as `` quantum einstein gravity '' or `` qeg '' .",
    "while flow equations can also be used in the effective field theory approach to quantum gravity @xcite , in the present context `` qeg '' stands for the fundamental theory whose continuum limit @xmath56 is taken at the non - gaussian fixed point .",
    "this theory has @xmath86 free parameters , and fixing these parameters amounts to picking a specific trajectory @xmath19 in the full theory space .",
    "for @xmath7 this trajectory hits the fixed point action @xmath87 , regarded as the collection of its infinitely many dimensionless coordinates on theory space .",
    "the fixed point action @xmath87 corresponds to the `` bare '' or `` classical '' action in conventional field theory .",
    "however , unlike the latter @xmath87 is not put in by hand but is rather _ derived _ with the help of the rg equation .",
    "the usual canonical or path integral quantization is always based upon a `` prejudice '' about what the classical action is . in the asymptotic safety scenario the `` classical '' action is fixed instead by the condition of nonperturbative renormalizability ; it can not be guessed by simple power - counting , symmetry , or invariance arguments , but the effective average action provides a computational framework to determine it .",
    "the really crucial property which defines qeg is the requirement of _ diffeomorphism invariance_. before we can write down a flow equation we must declare what the theory space is on which the renormalization group is supposed to operate . in the case of qeg it is defined to be the space of functionals @xmath34 $ ] depending on a nondegenerate , symmetric rank-2 tensor field in a diffeomorphism invariant way . leaving technical details aside , the theory space then fixes the flow equation which in turn determines the rg trajectories and the fixed points .",
    "so far our discussion referred to the exact theory on the full theory space .",
    "if we project on the subspace spanned by the einstein - hilbert truncation it is clear that also the fixed point action @xmath87 must be of the einstein - hilbert type .",
    "however , we emphasize that this is a trivial consequence of the simple truncation we have chosen , and we have no reason to believe that the exact @xmath87 is of the einstein - hilbert type , too .",
    "in fact , within the more complicated truncation of the present paper @xmath87 receives corrections which go beyond the einstein - hilbert form .",
    "hence `` quantum einstein gravity '' does _ not _ mean that the einstein - hilbert action is the bare action to be quantized . in this respect",
    "our approach is different from canonical quantum gravity , along the lines of ashtekar s program @xcite , for instance .",
    "( it is intriguing that also in this context remarkable finiteness properties have been proven recently @xcite . )",
    "clearly it is a highly attractive idea that there could be a nonperturbatively renormalizable field theory of the metric field so that there is no longer any conceptual need for leaving the framework of quantum field theory in order to arrive at a consistent microscopic theory of quantum gravity .",
    "therefore every effort should be made to show that the non - gaussian fixed point found in the einstein - hilbert truncation is not just an artifact of this approximation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we therefore started an extensive analysis of the reliability of the einstein - hilbert truncation near the fixed point . there",
    "the strategy was to use the scheme dependence of universal quantities in order to get a first idea about the precision which can be achieved with this truncation . here `` scheme dependence '' refers to the dependence on the details of the cutoff procedure , i.e. on the shape of the function @xmath11 . by definition ,",
    "universal quantities are exactly scheme independent in the exact theory , but they might acquire some scheme dependence once we make approximations . the level of this residual scheme dependence can serve as a measure for the quality of the approximation .",
    "typical universal quantities are the critical exponents of fixed points and , as we argued , the product @xmath88 .",
    "the upshot of our analysis was that the einstein - hilbert truncation seems to provide a description that is much more reliable and precise than originally hoped for , and that it would be very hard to understand the approximate scheme independence we found if the fixed point was just due to a misleading approximation .",
    "these results are certainly very encouraging , but it is clear that the ultimate justification of a truncation ansatz consists of adding further terms to it and verifying that its predictions do not change much . in the present paper",
    "we take a first step in this direction and add one further invariant constructed from @xmath32 to the ansatz .    which invariant should we take ?",
    "in standard renormalized perturbation theory where ( at least implicitly ) the @xmath56 limit is taken at the gaussian fixed point , the relative importance or `` relevance '' of the various field monomials is measured by their scaling dimensions at the gaussian fixed point , i.e. by their canonical dimensions simply . since at the non - gaussian fixed point",
    "the anomalous dimensions are large we have no similarly simple guide line at our disposal , and a priori all invariants are equally plausible . to get a first idea about what happens away from the einstein - hilbert subspace we shall include the higher - derivative invariant @xmath89 and study the rg flow in the `` @xmath1-truncation ''    , @xmath90 , @xmath91 . ]",
    "@xmath92=\\int d^dx\\,\\sqrt{g}\\left\\{\\left(16\\pi g_k\\right)^{-1 } \\left[-r(g)+2\\bar{\\lambda}_k\\right]+\\bar{\\beta}_k\\,r^2(g)\\right\\ } + \\mbox{classical gauge fixing}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] its truncation subspace is 3-dimensional , with coordinates @xmath93 , @xmath94 and the new coupling @xmath95 .",
    "it is well known that beyond @xmath89 there exist two     where one invariant can be eliminated by virtue of the gauss - bonnet identity . ]",
    "more @xmath96-invariants : @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in a standard perturbative calculation near",
    "the gaussian fixed point consistency would require to include them along with the @xmath1-term because they all have the same canonical dimension .",
    "as for the non - gaussian fixed point , we have no a priori information from general principles about the relative importance of the three terms . since anyhow the best we can do is to take a `` step into the dark '' , without knowing whether we walk in the most `` relevant '' direction , we shall omit the other two invariants here . including them",
    "would go far beyond the present calculational possibilities , in particular since it would require a much more complicated projection technique @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall derive the ( extremely complicated ) 3-dimensional rg equations of the @xmath1-truncation , and we shall use them in order to investigate the fixed points of the flow .",
    "our main results will be the following : a ) the gaussian fixed point of the einstein - hilbert truncation does _ not _ generalize to a fixed point of the @xmath1-truncation .",
    "b ) the non - gaussian fixed point does indeed generalize to a fixed point of the @xmath1-truncation , and the @xmath43-@xmath44projection of this fixed point is described almost perfectly by the einstein - hilbert truncation . within the ( weak ) residual scheme dependence ,",
    "the fixed point properties are almost insensitive to the inclusion of the @xmath1-invariant .",
    "this is further strong evidence against the theoretical possibility that the non - gaussian fixed point is a truncation artifact .    in the second part of the paper we shall address a very important general problem which is of a more technical nature .",
    "it is related to a notorious disease of standard euclidean quantum gravity : the conformal factor problem . in setting up the truncated rg equation the cutoff function @xmath21 ( actually a matrix in field space )",
    "is adapted to the truncation in such a way that , for @xmath14 , the inverse propagator of every massless mode , @xmath23 , is replaced by @xmath99 .",
    "a problem arises if there are modes , such as those of the conformal factor in the einstein - hilbert truncation , which have a negative kinetic energy , i.e. their inverse propagator is @xmath100 . in @xcite",
    "it has been argued that for these modes also the sign of @xmath21 should be reversed so as to obtain the regularized inverse propagator @xmath101 .",
    "while there is little doubt that this procedure is correct for the einstein - hilbert truncation , it leads to the seemingly paradoxical situation that in the euclidean path integral the modes of the conformal factor are enhanced rather than suppressed in the ir @xcite .",
    "contrary to the einstein - hilbert truncation , the @xmath1-truncation yields a functional @xmath36 $ ] which is bounded below and , as we shall see , gives positive kinetic energy to _ all _ modes , provided one stays close to the uv fixed point .",
    "hence our investigation of the non - gaussian fixed point is not plagued by the conformal factor problem , and the construction of the cutoff becomes straightforward .",
    "this advantage is an independent motivation for studying the @xmath1-truncation .    in the usual perturbative approach higher - derivative theories of ( lorentzian ) gravity",
    "are notoriously problematic as far as causality and unitarity are concerned @xcite . while in @xmath73 the most general @xmath96-theory , when expanded about flat space , is power - counting renormalizable it suffers from excitations with , classically , negative linearized energy and , quantum mechanically , a wrong - sign residue of the propagator leading to a state space containing negative - norm states @xcite .",
    "these `` ghosts '' have masses of the order of the planck mass .",
    "correspondingly , if a truncation ansatz is of the @xmath96-type the @xmath2-dependent effective propagator @xmath102 , evaluated for flat space , has similar ghosts with masses @xmath103 @xmath65 . by itself",
    "this does not indicate any real problem because generically flat space anyhow is not a solution of the effective equation of motion .",
    "compared to the perturbative quantization the potential problem of ghost excitations manifests itself in the euclidean rg approach in a conceptually different , more tractable manner . here",
    "the linearization is performed about the backgrounds needed for the projection procedure , not about flat space . for a well - defined computation of the rg trajectories on a certain @xmath2-interval",
    "it is sufficient that the ( truncated ) @xmath3 gives positive linearized action to all modes contributing to the rg running in this interval . in our calculation",
    "this will indeed be the case for @xmath2 large enough where the truncation is believed to be reliable @xcite .",
    "the much more subtle issues related to a lorentzian interpretation of the theory and its causality properties can be addressed only once a complete trajectory , valid down to the ir , and in particular the precise form of the fixed point action is known . from all",
    "what we can tell now the exact qeg could very well be `` causal '' in an appropriate sense .",
    "a brief summary of some of the results derived in the present paper appeared in @xcite , and an informal introduction to the older work can be found in @xcite . in the present paper we focus on pure gravity .",
    "the gravitational average action with matter fields included was discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gauge fixing dependence of the original formulation @xcite was investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an incomplete higher - derivative calculation was begun in @xcite where the running of the @xmath1-couplings was neglected , however , and no conclusions about the fixed point could be drawn .",
    "the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows . in section [ 3s2 ]",
    "we review some general properties of the exact rg equation which will be needed later on .",
    "section [ 3s3 ] is devoted to the construction of cutoffs which are adapted to a specific truncation ; in particular the complications due to the conformal factor problem will be discussed there . in section [ @xmath1-trunc ]",
    "we derive the system of rg equations which results from the @xmath1-truncation , and in section [ 3s5 ] we analyze its fixed point structure .",
    "we discuss the fate of the gaussian fixed point which is present only in the einstein - hilbert truncation , and we reanalyze the non - gaussian fixed point in the more general setting . in section [ 3s6 ] the positivity properties of the truncated action functional , its hessian , and",
    "the cutoff operator are investigated ; in particular we show that our analysis of the non - gaussian fixed point is not affected by the conformal factor problem .",
    "the conclusions are contained in section [ conclusio ] .",
    "many important technical results , including the coefficients occuring in the rather complicated beta - functions of the @xmath43-@xmath70-@xmath104system , are tabulated in various appendices .",

    ", the conformal factor @xmath210 has @xmath211 .    the important question is how @xmath161 should be chosen when @xmath205 is negative .",
    "if we continue to use @xmath207 , the rg equation is still well - defined because the inverse propagator @xmath212 $ ] never vanishes so that the functional traces on the rhs of ( [ truncflow ] ) are not suffering from any ir problem .",

    "even worse , it can introduce a spurious singularity at the value of @xmath23 for which @xmath215 .    at first sight",
    "the choice @xmath213 might have appeared to be the more natural one because only if @xmath216 the factor @xmath217 is a damped exponential which suppresses the low - momentum modes under the path integral .",
    "nevertheless it was argued in @xcite that the `` @xmath207-rule '' is the correct choice both for @xmath218 and @xmath211 .",
    "the calculations in @xcite and all subsequent papers @xcite were based upon this rule . on the one hand",
    ", this rule guarantees that the rg equation is well - defined and consistent . on the other hand ,",
    "it is difficult to give a meaning to the euclidean functional integral from which this rg equation was derived at the formal level . in the case @xmath219 the factor @xmath220 is a growing exponential which seems to enhance rather than suppress the low - momentum modes .",
    "however , as suggested by the perturbative argument above , this conclusion is too naive probably .",
    "let us now come to the case where the functions @xmath202 are not linear in @xmath203 but , say , of the form @xmath221 . in this case",
    "the rule ( [ rule ] ) demands that we choose the corresponding operators @xmath222 in such a way that they contain cutoff terms adjusted to both the @xmath223- and the @xmath203-terms of the kinetic operator . for the above example , which is relevant to the @xmath1-truncation",

    "obviously we have to set @xmath225 and @xmath226 in order to achieve that the propagator and the cutoff combine as prescribed by the rule ( [ rule ] ) .",

    "we refer to this prescription , too , as the @xmath207-rule .",
    "we believe that the @xmath207-rule is correct also for @xmath211 , and that it is the relation between the manifestly well - defined flow equation and the formal path integral that needs to be understood better .",
    "various attitudes are possible here . for instance , one could postulate that the fundamental definition of the theory is in terms of the flow equation rather than the path integral .",
    "since the former is much better defined than the latter ( in particular also with respect to the usual uv and ir problems ) one would simply discard the path integral then .",
    "another way out is to adopt the usual , albeit rather ad hoc , prescription of wick - rotating the conformal factor @xmath228 which turns the growing exponential into a decaying one .",
    "a much more attractive and less radical possibility is the following .",
    "presumably it will be possible to construct an effective average action for _ lorentzian _ quantum gravity by invoking a kind of stationary phase argument for the mode suppression .",
    "then one deals with oscillating exponentials @xmath229 , and apart from the trivial substitutions @xmath230 , @xmath231 the flow equation remains the same as in euclidean gravity . for @xmath207 it has all the desired features , and @xmath211 poses no special problem for the path integral .",
    "it is interesting that there are also recent indications @xcite coming from the dynamical triangulation approach to quantum gravity @xcite which suggest that the lorentzian path integral might have a better chance of being well - defined than the euclidean one .    as the last possibility we mention the best of all situations , namely that in an exact treatment there are simply no factors",
    "if this is actually the case , the conformal factor problem which we encounter in the einstein - hilbert and similar truncations would have the status of an unphysical truncation artifact .",
    "if so , the `` @xmath207-rule '' could be interpreted as a device which helps in approximating as well as possible the exact rg flow by a truncated flow .",
    "it is one of the main results of the present paper that this scenario is indeed realized to some extent .",
    "we shall see that within the @xmath1-truncation those terms of @xmath202 which dominate at sufficiently large momenta have @xmath218 at least for large enough values of @xmath2 @xmath232 . for too low scales",
    "@xmath233 some of the @xmath205 s might turn negative , but at these scales the @xmath1-truncation becomes unreliable probably @xcite so that the negative @xmath205 s might be due to an insufficient truncation .",
    "it is not excluded that in the exact theory the dominating @xmath205 s are positive down to @xmath234 .",
    "as all those @xmath205 s which determine the sign of the dominating contributions to @xmath202 are positive for large values of @xmath2 , the cutoff has the standard suppression properties and is not plagued by any conformal factor problem for @xmath7 .",
    "this , then , allows for an unambiguous investigation of the uv fixed point and its properties .",
    "it is quite remarkable that , as we shall see , all results concerning the fixed point are basically the same for the @xmath1-truncation ( where @xmath235 at least for the dominating terms ) and the einstein - hilbert truncation with both positive and negative factors @xmath207 .",
    "this is certainly a quite impressive confirmation of the @xmath207-rule .      in the next section",

    "<S> motivated by recent evidence indicating that quantum einstein gravity ( qeg ) might be nonperturbatively renormalizable , the exact renormalization group equation of qeg is evaluated in a truncation of theory space which generalizes the einstein - hilbert truncation by the inclusion of a higher - derivative term @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the beta - functions describing the renormalization group flow of the cosmological constant , newton s constant , and the @xmath1-coupling are computed explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> the fixed point properties of the 3-dimensional flow are investigated , and they are confronted with those of the 2-dimensional einstein - hilbert flow . the non - gaussian fixed point predicted by the latter is found to generalize to a fixed point on the enlarged theory space . in order to test the reliability of the @xmath1-truncation near this fixed point we analyze the residual scheme dependence of various universal quantities ; it turns out to be very weak . </S>",
    "<S> the two truncations are compared in detail , and their numerical predictions are found to agree with a suprisingly high precision . due to the consistency of the results it appears increasingly unlikely that the non - gaussian fixed point is an artifact of the truncation . </S>",
    "<S> if it is present in the exact theory qeg is probably nonperturbatively renormalizable and `` asymptotically safe '' . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the conformal factor problem of euclidean gravity manifests itself in the exact renormalization group approach and show that , in the @xmath1-truncation , the investigation of the fixed point is not afflicted with this problem . </S>",
    "<S> also the gaussian fixed point of the einstein - hilbert truncation is analyzed ; it turns out that it does not generalize to a corresponding fixed point on the enlarged theory space .    </S>",
