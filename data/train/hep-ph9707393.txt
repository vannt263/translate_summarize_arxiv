    "one of the simplest characteristics of the hadronic final state is the particle multiplicity . following the ideas of a soft hadronization mechanism @xcite the observable hadron multiplicity in a quark or gluon jet",
    "is expected to follow closely that of the final qcd partons in its energy dependence .",
    "more specifically , within the picture of local parton hadron duality ( lphd ) @xcite the primary parton of energy @xmath5 generates a parton cascade which is evolved down to small scales of a few hundred mev for the transverse momentum cutoff @xmath2 .",
    "then , within the so - called modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) , which takes into account the leading double logarithmic and next to leading single logarithmic terms , a good description of the mean charged particle multiplicity in @xmath3 annihilation as a function of the primary @xmath6 energy @xmath7 is obtained with a formula @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes the multiplicity of partons in a single quark jet of energy @xmath5 and @xmath10 is the qcd scale . from fits in the energy range",
    "@xmath11 gev one typically finds @xmath12 250 mev and the normalization @xmath13 @xcite . assuming @xmath14 the number of all hadrons ( charged and neutral ) is then about twice as large as the number of partons ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "another characteristic of the final state is the mean multiplicity of jets @xmath16 for a given resolution parameter @xmath1 , or , in conventional normalization , @xmath17 .",
    "early results at low resolution in @xmath18 @xcite played an important role as a qcd test and in the determination of the running coupling @xmath19 .",
    "the calculation of jet multiplicities to all orders in @xmath19 became feasible using the durham/@xmath0 algorithm @xcite which takes as separation parameter for two jets the measure @xmath20 which for small relative angles @xmath21 approximates the rescaled transverse momentum @xmath22 of the jet of lower momentum with respect to that of higher momentum",
    ". then the jet multiplicity @xmath23 refers to all jets with separation @xmath24 .",
    "jet multiplicities in leading and next - to - leading order of @xmath25 have been calculated @xcite and , after matching with the full @xmath26 results , a good description of jet multiplicities down to @xmath27 has been obtained @xcite . in these calculations",
    "the jet multiplicities are derived in absolute normalization ( @xmath28 ) from @xmath29    in this paper we investigate whether both observables , jet multiplicities and hadron multiplicities , can be described in a unified way . indeed , the resummation of the perturbative series has been achieved in both cases by using the same type of evolution equation .",
    "also , the durham/@xmath0 algorithm of the jet definition ( [ durhamy ] ) coincides for @xmath30 with the prescription @xmath31 which is applied in the description of hadrons within the lphd picture . at a first sight",
    "there is no smooth transition for @xmath30 from ( [ njet ] ) to ( [ nch ] ) because of the two additional constants in ( [ nch ] ) .",
    "furthermore , various jet observables for small @xmath32 deviate from the perturbative predictions ( see , for example , review @xcite ) , and this is often taken as evidence for nonperturbative hadronization effects at the resolution scales @xmath33 gev .    we show that these problems  in the case of the mean jet or particle multiplicity  disappear if the underlying coupled evolution equations for quark and gluon jets are solved with sufficiently high accuracy ; here we perform a numerical integration to obtain the exact solutions .",
    "we start from the evolution equation for the generating functional of the multiparton final state @xcite which , in the parton splitting process @xmath34 , takes into account angular ordering , energy conservation and the running coupling at the one - loop order . by appropriate differentiation",
    "we obtain the evolution equations for the mean parton multiplicities @xmath35 and @xmath36 in quark and gluon jets with jet virtuality @xmath37 ( see also @xcite ) or with @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the maximum angle between the outgoing partons @xmath40 and @xmath41 . at fixed cutoff",

    "the boundaries of the integral over the parton momentum fractions @xmath46 are determined by the lower cutoff in the transverse momentum measure @xmath51 defined according to ( [ durhamy ] ) with the approximation @xmath52 @xmath53 the lower bound @xmath54 in ( [ eveq ] ) is obtained for minimal @xmath55 which is found for @xmath56 ( in this configuration , because of transverse momentum conservation , the high energy secondary parton has production angle @xmath57 and the soft particle @xmath58 ) ; more generally , @xmath39 corresponds to the half opening angle of the jet ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath54 is given by @xmath60 since @xmath61 , one finds @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the coupling is given by @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "we evolve @xmath66 with @xmath51 by matching smoothly the couplings for @xmath48 and @xmath67 at twice the heavy quark thresholds according to the formula @xmath68 the factor two in the threshold for heavy quark production takes into account that heavy quarks are produced in pairs by a gluon .",
    "the differential equations are defined only for @xmath69 .",
    "the initial conditions for the solutions of ( [ eveq ] ) then read ( for any fixed @xmath1 ) @xmath70    analytical solutions using the boundary conditions at threshold have been derived within the mlla for gluon jets@xcite and for the coupled system of quark and gluon jets@xcite .",
    "whereas the mlla yields a good high energy behaviour , it leads to inconsistencies ( @xmath71 ) near threshold . in the present analysis",
    "we solve the equations ( [ eveq ] ) and ( [ init ] ) numerically .",
    ", calculate @xmath72 in steps of length @xmath73 from the derivatives ( [ eveq ] ) as @xmath74 using the trapezoidal rule for the integration and linear interpolation for the required @xmath75 values under the integral .",
    "the integration is performed with logarithmic variable @xmath76 . ]",
    "the two jets in @xmath3 annihilation evolve independently in this approximation . near threshold this factorization of the generating functional",
    "does not hold any more and non - logarithmic terms become important . for the @xmath0 resolution criterion ( [ durhamy ] )",
    "the inelastic threshold is found for symmetric 3-jet events ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) with @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "this is to be compared with @xmath81 and @xmath82 for eq .",
    "( [ eveq ] ) .",
    "the difference of thresholds will clearly affect the results in the large @xmath32 region .",
    "an improvement in this region can be achieved by replacing the contribution of @xmath83 in ( [ eveq ] ) by the explicit result for @xmath84 partons in @xmath83 ( see also ref .",
    "the lowest order contribution @xmath85 of the evolution equation is obtained by taking the first iteration of ( [ eveq ] ) with the initial conditions ( [ init ] ) , i.e. , replacing the three @xmath75-terms in the curly brackets in ( [ eveq ] ) by unity . the full @xmath83 contribution is found by numerical integration of @xmath86 where @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) denote the quark ( antiquark ) and @xmath89 the gluon momentum fractions ( @xmath90 = 4/3 ) . here",
    "the coupling is taken again as running with the @xmath0 measure ( [ durhamy ] ) @xmath91 as scale in the integration region @xmath92 in ( [ jet3 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath83 corrected solution @xmath93 is then obtained from @xmath94 a corresponding improved result for the gluon jet is not yet available and has to be considered for each process separately . in this paper",
    "we apply the equation ( [ nepem ] ) to the full range of scale parameters @xmath95 , i.e. , we study the jet region ( @xmath96 ) and also the transition from the jets to the fully resolved hadrons ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "in fig . 1a we show the data of the average jet multiplicity at @xmath98 = 91 gev @xcite as a function of the resolution parameter @xmath99 as obtained with the @xmath0 algorithm .",
    "the theoretical predictions from ( [ nepem ] ) for the jet data are given in absolute normalization in terms of the single parameter @xmath10 .",
    "also shown are the data on hadron multiplicities in the energy range @xmath98 = 1.6@xmath100 91 gev  @xcite taken as @xmath101 as a function of the same scale parameter , now calculated as @xmath102 , where the parameter @xmath2 corresponds to the parton @xmath0 cutoff characterizing a hadronic scale and is obtained from a fit to the data .",
    "another adjustable parameter here is the overall normalization @xmath103 which relates the parton and hadron multiplicities in @xmath104 .",
    "we determine first the @xmath10 parameter from the jet multiplicity ( lower data set in fig . 1 ) and then the @xmath103 and @xmath2 from the hadronic multiplicity ( upper data set ) . a good description of the data is obtained with parameters @xmath105 which correspond to the curves shown in fig .",
    "the quantity @xmath106 derived from the same experimental data is shown in fig .",
    "the dashed curves represent the contribution @xmath107 in ( [ nepem ] ) from the evolution equation alone .",
    "the fits can be seen to describe quantitatively the hadron multiplicity , the jet multiplicity for the small and large @xmath32 , whereas in the intermediate region around @xmath108 the fit exceeds the data on @xmath106 by up to 20% ( up to 5% in @xmath75 ) .",
    "deviations of this type may indicate the importance of two - loop @xmath18 terms not included in the analysis .    as a remarkable result of our analysis",
    "we find that the common normalization @xmath28 is possible without difficulty ; the normalization parameter @xmath103 is correlated with @xmath2 and can be varied within about 30% .",
    "the solution with @xmath103 = 1 is natural as it provides the correct boundary conditions @xmath109 at threshold for both hadrons and jets .",
    "then a continuous connection between jet and hadron data results , since both are described by the same evolution equation ( [ nepem ] ) . in this description",
    "a single hadron corresponds to a single parton of low virtuality @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the two sets of data at the same @xmath32 .",
    "the difference between the two curves comes entirely from the running of @xmath19 .",
    "namely , if @xmath19 were kept fixed in equations ( [ eveq ] ) the resulting multiplicities would depend only on the ratio of the available scales through the variable @xmath110 but not on the absolute size of @xmath98 and the two curves in fig .",
    "1 would coincide . a model with fixed",
    "@xmath19 would predict at high energy a power like dependence on q , i.e. a straight line in fig .",
    "1a between the two curves shown .",
    "the largest difference occurs near the inelastic threshold at @xmath111 or @xmath112 . in this region",
    "@xmath106 is dominated by the contribution of order @xmath19 and the jet and hadron results at the same @xmath32 are in the ratio of the relevant typical coupling constants . at the lowest available energy for the hadron multiplicity ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 gev )",
    "this ratio of couplings is larger than 10 , so the typical coupling to produce hadrons at 1.6 gev is @xmath115 .",
    "the good matching of the prediction for hadrons with the boundary condition at threshold suggests that the coupling is rising even more towards lower energies .",
    "the strong variation of the coupling at small scales has been found important also in the description of particle energy spectra@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the jet multiplicity is first rising very slowly with decreasing @xmath32 , because of the small coupling ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "only for very high resolution , if @xmath1 is lowered from 900 mev ( @xmath117 ) to the final 500 mev , about three quarters of the final multiplicity are produced , three times as many jets as in the large complementary kinematic region .",
    "the steep rise toward small @xmath32 in fig .  1 reflects the singularity in the coupling at @xmath118 , which is however screened by the hadronization scale @xmath119 .",
    "this behaviour is qualitatively described by the high energy dla result@xcite @xmath120 with @xmath121 which at high energies and small @xmath122 behaves as @xmath123 .",
    "this form , for fixed @xmath1 , describes the slow rise of multiplicity with @xmath124 , whereas , for fixed @xmath98 , it exhibits the logarithmic singularity for @xmath125 0 .",
    "this singularity arises in the first iteration of ( [ eveq ] ) ( the `` born - term '' ) from the contribution @xmath126 .",
    "previous approximate solutions had been restricted to @xmath127 for jets , whereas for hadrons the analytical results could only be applied to the higher energy region with a larger @xmath128 factor . and therefore lead to a delayed rise with energy  @xcite .",
    "our exact solution in the present @xmath6 energy range is about twice as large and rises more slowly than the analytical mlla solution for @xmath129  @xcite . ]",
    "our results are consistent with the previous finding @xmath130 from the energy moments @xcite ; on the other hand , @xmath131 = 0 is not allowed in  ( [ eveq ] ) , as the multiplicity would diverge in this case",
    ".    it will be interesting to study this behaviour further near the transition @xmath132 also at other @xmath6 energies , especially for the jet multiplicity , since it varies strongly in the low @xmath32 range . in the experimental analysis using eq .",
    "( [ durhamy ] ) the full hadronic multiplicity will only be reached for @xmath133 0 .",
    "the same lower cutoff for partons and hadrons is achieved if we interpret @xmath1 as transverse mass cutoff with @xmath2 as effective mass parameter ( see also @xcite ) , i.e. , if we relate the theoretical predictions and experimental results from cutoff  ( [ durhamy ] ) by @xmath134 .",
    "the value  ( [ results ] ) for the scale @xmath10 is larger than that found in previous analyses of particle spectra@xcite .",
    "this difference comes from taking the durham @xmath51 not only in the integral boundaries but also as argument of @xmath19 and in the definition of hadrons by @xmath135 .",
    "we performed an alternative calculation where we used the standard @xmath136 as argument of @xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath137 instead of eq .",
    "( [ kperp ] ) and the exact @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ jet3 ] ) ) and inserted the cutoff @xmath138 into eqs .",
    "( [ eveq ] ) and  ( [ jet3 ] ) ; then a description of comparable quality is obtained with the lower scale @xmath139 gev and the same @xmath131 parameter 250 gev comes from taking the scale @xmath140 in  ( [ kperp ] ) instead of @xmath141 . ] .",
    "the threshold for hadrons is shifted in this case to the lower value @xmath142 and also the hadron data points are shifted to the left in fig .  1 according to the lower value of @xmath2 .",
    "our conclusions about the order of magnitude variation of @xmath19 remain unaltered .",
    "the ambiguity in choosing the scale for @xmath19 may be reduced in 2-loop calculations ; for now we stay with the conceptually simplest possibility and take @xmath51 throughout .      the evolution equations ( [ eveq ] ) yield also results on the mean multiplicity @xmath143 in gluon jets .",
    "the results derived here refer to the multiplicity in the full hemisphere of the gluon jet and can be measured , for example , in a final state with a primary @xmath144 colour singlet state .",
    "such a state is expected to be produced in the decay of heavy quarkonia ; recently the multiplicity in the decay @xmath145 has been measured by the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "an initial state of this type can also be realized approximately in @xmath84 jets with nearly antiparallel @xmath146 and @xmath147 recoiling against the gluon @xcite ; this configuration has been analysed by the opal collaboration @xcite corresponding to our calculation is obtained if the higher jet multiplicities are also taken into account . ] .",
    "our results do not apply immediately to other configurations ( like `` y '' or `` mercedes '' ) where the large angle soft radiation from the gluon is suppressed ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .    of special interest",
    "is the ratio of gluon and quark jet multiplicity @xmath148 , which is predicted to approach asymptotically the value @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "the next - to - leading order corrections decrease this ratio at finite energies @xcite and yet further with the inclusion of higher order corrections @xcite .",
    "there is an uncertainty with these asymptotic predictions in that the region of validity is not known a priori .",
    "a complete solution of the evolution equations ( [ eveq ] ) requires an initial value for the multiplicities at some energy .",
    "such results with absolute normalization at threshold have been presented within the mlla @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the results from our evolution equation ( [ eveq ] ) with initial condition ( [ init ] ) , however , we have not yet included a low energy correction term as in ( [ nepem ] ) which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the results for the ratio @xmath150 are shown in fig .",
    "2 again as function of @xmath151 for hadron multiplicities in comparison with the opal and cleo data mentioned above . also shown is the prediction for jets at fixed @xmath152 gev which could be tested using the same type of events with antiparallel @xmath153 .",
    "there is a very good agreement of our calculation with the opal data which refer to jet energies of @xmath15440 gev . from fig .",
    "1b one may expect that the inclusion of the full @xmath83 corrections would not modify the prediction essentially ( by more than about 10% ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the cleo data fall considerably below the prediction @xmath155 from the evolution equation . in this region , however , the low energy corrections may not be small : in fig 1b these corrections correspond to a factor of two",
    ". a more precise prediction of the @xmath156 data will require the inclusion of the full @xmath83 correction to the @xmath157 process .",
    "we solved the qcd evolution equations for quark and gluon jets exactly by numerical integration and also supplemented the full @xmath83 correction for @xmath3 annihilation . with this improved accuracy beyond mlla",
    "we obtain a unified description with common absolute normalization of the mean jet multiplicity at lep-1 and the hadron multiplicities in the energy range from @xmath158 to 91 gev within the errors or at least within 5% . in this description only the qcd scale @xmath10 and a @xmath0 cutoff parameter @xmath159 for the hadrons according to the lphd picture have been adjusted to the data .",
    "the ratio of gluon to quark multiplicity at lep-1 is described as well .    of particular interest",
    "is the success of this model in the regions where perturbative qcd is not expected to be relevant a priori , namely for small transverse momenta , where the running coupling gets large , either for the hadron multiplicity near threshold or for the jet multiplicity at very high resolution . in both cases the strong effect of the running @xmath19 is clearly seen from the comparison of the two multiplicities at the same scale @xmath32 ; taking the transverse momentum as the argument of @xmath19 provides about the right separation .",
    "it appears that perturbative qcd is still successful in these extreme kinematic regions for this inclusive quantity .",
    "the model for hadron production emerging from this analysis is very simple .",
    "a hadron can be treated formally like a narrow microjet of partons but with the radiated partons being so soft ( @xmath160 ) that they can not be resolved and are therefore confined in a region characterized by the hadronic scale @xmath2 of a few hundred mev .",
    "so a hadron in this picture does not correspond to a colour singlet state of valence partons `` but rather to a single parton ( quark or gluon ) with about the same momentum together with a sea '' of soft confined partons which take care of the colour neutralization . in this way the soft hadronization picture can become consistent with the perturbative treatment of particle production .",
