    "there has long been considerable circumstantial evidence that at least some luminous , low - redshift qsos are the result of strong interactions or mergers of galaxies ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",

    "however , a concrete suggestion for an evolutionary scenario for such objects was lacking until @xcite showed that ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) , virtually all of which are compelling examples of ongoing mergers , had bolometric luminosities and space densities similar to those of qsos .",
    "these similarities suggested the possibility that uligs are dust - enshrouded qsos which , after blowing away the dust , become classical qsos .    if this hypothesis is correct , one should be able to observe examples of objects that are at intermediate stages of this evolutionary sequence .",
    "we are conducting a study of a sample of low - redshift objects that may be in such a transitionary state .",

    ", we are attempting to construct interaction histories for each of these `` transition '' objects .",
    "if strong interactions triggered the qso activity and induced starbursts , one might expect both events to occur roughly simultaneously , since both are plausibly dependent on gas flows to the inner regions .",
    "thus , we are placing these objects on an age sequence by measuring the time elapsed since the last major starburst event . this age sequence along with interaction histories can help us answer the question of whether the intermediate position of these objects is indicative of evolution from the ulig to the classical qso population , or whether it simply indicates a range of characteristics in qsos .",
    "our sample is drawn from the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite samples of _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) objects , and it consists of those objects which have : ( 1 ) a luminosity above the cutoff defined for quasars by @xcite , _",

[ firplot ] ) .",
    "although mrk231 just misses the luminosity threshold given above , its active nucleus is known to suffer heavy extinction ( see  [ mrk231 ] ) , apart from which it would clearly be a member of the sample .",
    "we know of no other objects satisfying the other criteria for which this is true .",
    "we have therefore chosen to include it for the present , although it may be approriate to exclude it from some of the analyses of the whole sample , which will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "so far , we have presented results for two of the nine objects in the sample : 3c48 ( * ? ? ? * hereafter cs2000 ) , an ongoing merger near the peak of starburst activity ; and pg1700 + 518 ( * ? ? ?",

    "the slit was 1  wide , projecting to @xmath145 pixels on the tektronix 2048@xmath152048 ccd .",

    "table [ journal ] shows a complete journal of observations , with specification of the slit positions , and total integration times .",
    "the spectra were reduced with iraf , using standard reduction procedures . after subtracting bias , dividing by a normalized halogen lamp flat - field frame and removing sky lines",
    ", we rectified the two - dimensional spectra and placed them on a wavelength scale using the least - mean - squares fit of cubic spline segments to identified lines in a hg - kr - ne lamp .",
    "we calibrated the spectra using spectrophotometric standards from @xcite observed with the slit at the parallactic angle .",
    "the distortions in the spatial coordinate were removed with the iraf _ apextract _ routines . for each slit position , we had two or three individual frames ; we averaged the spatially corrected spectra using the iraf task _",
    "scombine_. we then corrected the spectra for galactic extinction , using the values given by @xcite . since we were aiming to observe the youngest populations in the host galaxies of these objects , we chose the slit positions based on previously obtained color maps of the host galaxies .",
    "we obtained imaging data for the three objects with the university of hawaii 2.2  m telescope as specified in table [ imaging ] .",
    "observations with the @xmath16 filter ( centered at 3410   with a bandpass of 320  ) sample the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies on the short side of both the 4000   break and the balmer limit .",
    "this region is very sensitive to the age of the stellar population , and will be brightest in regions of very recent star formation ( ages @xmath17 myr ) , as well as regions with scattered qso continuum .",
    "observations in @xmath18band sample the region redwards of the balmer limit , where @xmath14a - type stellar populations are expected to peak , while longer wavelength optical and near infrared images will map the distribution of late - type stellar populations .",
    "the @xmath19 color maps will then highlight the regions of most recent star formation while @xmath20 will point to the somewhat older ( @xmath21 myr ) populations .",
    "thus our slit positions generally cover the regions brightest in these color maps .",
    "in general , the spectra from each slit position were subdivided into regions corresponding to some of the main features observed in the optical ground - based images , and one - dimensional spectra were extracted by summing pixels corresponding to the regions of interest .",
    "the spectra of regions close to the qso nucleus were contaminated by scattered qso light .",
    "the scattered light was removed by subtracting from each region a version of the quasar nuclear spectrum , scaled to match the broad - line flux . in the case of mrk1014",
    ", none of our slit positions went through the qso , so we obtained a separate 200 s exposure of the nucleus .",
    "spectra from those slit positions which actually went through the qso nucleus suffered from strong light scattering within the spectrograph , particularly in the spectral region around h@xmath22 .",
    "therefore we were unable to obtain spectra of regions closer than @xmath23  from the qso nucleus for these slit positions .",
    "wfpc2 images of the three objects were obtained from the _ hst _ data archive .",
    "we used three 600 s wfc2 images of mrk1014 in the f675w filter , one 400 s and two 600 s pc1 images of iras07598 + 6508 in the f702w filter , and two 1100 s pc1 images of mrk231 in the f439w filter .",
    "most cosmic rays were removed by subtracting a median image from each of the individual frames , then thresholding the difference at a 3@xmath24 level , setting points above this threshold to the median of the difference image .",
    "pixels near the position of the peak of the qso were excluded from this process .",
    "the corrected difference image was then added back to the median image , giving a corrected version of the original image .",
    "the few cosmic rays within the relevant region that escaped this process were removed manually with the iraf task _ imedit_. in the case of mrk231 , where only two images were available , we first subtracted one from the other , and proceeded as above .",
    "the procedure was repeated , interchanging the images .",
    "all the corrected images for each object were then averaged .",
    "we use @xcite isochrone synthesis models to fit the spectra of the host galaxies .",
    "we will see in the following sections that the three objects which are the subject of this paper show strong evidence of having undergone some major tidal interaction . as we have described in our previous work ( cs97 , cs2000 ) , spectra of the host galaxies of such objects show features from both young ( _ e.g. , _  strong balmer lines ) and old ( _ e.g. , _   absorption ) stellar populations , and can usually be fitted satisfactorily by a two - component model .",
    "this model includes an old underlying stellar population , presumably the stellar component present prior to interaction , and a younger instantaneous burst model , presumably produced as a result of the interaction .",
    "a population with no age dispersion will be a reasonable approximation of the actual starburst as long as the period during which the star formation rate was greatly enhanced is short compared to the age of the population itself .",
    "we have also noted previously ( scc98 ) that the age of the superposed starburst is remarkably robust with respect to the different assumptions about the nature of the older stellar component .",
    "thus , we select a reasonable old underlying population ( with certain variations as described in each section below ) and assume that the same underlying population is present everywhere in the host galaxy . to this population we add instantaneous burst , @xcite initial mass function , solar metallicity models of various ages .",
    "we then perform a @xmath25 fit to the data to determine the scaling of each component and the age of the most recent starburst .",
    "the errors in the starburst ages that we quote are estimated by noting the youngest and oldest best fits for which @xmath26 changes by 15% with respect to the minimum value ( see cs2000 for details ) .    in some cases , stellar absorption features ( most often the balmer lines )",
    "were contaminated by emission coming from the extended narrow emission line region around the qso . in some cases , we subtracted a scaled synthetic spectrum of the recombination lines assuming case  b. however , in calculating @xmath26 for the model fitting , we generally excluded those lines that suffered most from contamination .",
    "all spectra are displayed as observed ( _ i.e. , _  without line subtraction ) , unless otherwise specified .    as we discussed in cs2000 , because of our limited spatial resolution ( generally @xmath27 ) and projection along the line of sight , we are likely observing the integrated spectrum of several starbursts of different ages , and the age we determine will be somewhat older than the youngest starbursts . therefore the ages we report should be regarded as upper limits to the most recent episodes of star formation along the line of sight .    in objects with recent starbursts ,",
    "the effect of reddening by dust is an obvious concern .",
    "however , studies of low - redshift agns and uligs at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths indicate that dust is generally heavily concentrated within @xmath28 kpc of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "in addition , have found ( scc98 ) that even in a case where the optical  ir spectral index is strongly affected by dust , the stellar ages from spectral features in the rest - frame 32005200   region remain fairly robust .",
    "this relative insensitivity to dust can be attributed to the fact that we are largely dealing with dust that is intermixed with the stars and that we preferentially observe regions with low extinction and , thus , low reddening . even in regions where dust along the line of sight is significant",
    ", the reddening in our observed bandpass is likely to be largely compensated by blue light scattered into our line of sight .",
    "mrk1014 ( @xmath29 ) is a luminous ( m@xmath30 ) , infrared loud ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) radio - quiet qso which shows a luminous host galaxy .",
    "the host galaxy has two large `` spiral - like arms '' ( @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ mrk1014mos ] and fig .",
    "[ mrk1014hst ] ) .",
    "its spectrum indicates a mixture of old and young stars @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite , in a spectroscopic survey of 26 rlqs , rqqs , and radio galaxies , observed the host galaxy of mrk1014 with the mayall 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory and with the 4.2 m william herschel telescope at la palma .",
    "they modeled the spectra and determined an age of 12 gyr for the host galaxy of mrk1014 .",
    "their approach is exactly opposite to ours ( see  [ modeling ] ) : they fix the age of a possible young single starburst population to 0.1 gyr and let that of a second , older single starburst population ( what we would call the `` underlying population '' ) vary .",
    "their reason for including the 0.1 gyr population is to account for `` the spectral shape of the blue light '' which they attribute to either a recent burst of star formation or contamination of the slit by scattered light from the qso nucleus .",
    "their results will be discussed further in  [ smrk1014spec ] .",
    "the host galaxy of mrk1014 shows stellar absorption features with redshifts remarkably close to those of the qso broad and narrow emission lines ( @xmath31 , as measured from our spectrum ) .    we have obtained and modeled spectra of different regions in the host galaxy of mrk1014 , and we shall refer to them according to their label in fig .",
    "[ mrk1014slit ] .",
    "we have chosen a 10 gyr old population with an exponentially declining star formation rate with an e - folding time of 3 gyr as an old underlying population .",
    "this model fits reasonably well the spectrum of a galaxy 60  west - southwest of the qso at the same redshift and only slightly smaller than the `` bulge '' ( see below ) of mrk1014 .",
    "( this galaxy was in our slit while obtaining the 200 s exposure of the qso ) .",
    "the assumption that the host galaxy ( or parent galaxies ) of mrk1014 had a similar star formation history to this galaxy need not be accurate as the precise model we use as the pre - existing population makes little difference in the age determination of the starburst population ( scc98 ) . for comparison",
    ", we have tried using a generic elliptical galaxy spectrum , and a model with a longer e - folding time ( _ i.e. , _  5 gyr ) as underlying populations in the modeling of the spectra in mrk1014 .",
    "we obtain the same starburst ages , though slightly different flux contributions from the old population , regardless of the model used .",
    "figure  [ mrk1014mos ] includes a @xmath32 color map of mrk1014 .",
    "this image emphasizes those regions with a steeper blue continuum spectrum , peaking just redwards of the balmer limit .",
    "these regions are concentrated mainly along the north edge of the tail ( regions @xmath33 and @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ mrk1014slit ] ) , in a clump on the east end of the tail ( @xmath35 ) , directly east of the nucleus ( not covered by our slits ) , and southwest of the qso nucleus ( @xmath36 ) .",

    "figure  [ mrk1014hst ] shows compact knots at the positions of regions @xmath33 through @xmath37 , and planetary camera _ hst _ images @xcite show a larger and very bright blue knot at the position of region @xmath36 .",
    "even though there are knots at the positions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , it is evident from colors and spectroscopy that there is recent star formation all along the north edge of the tail ( _ i.e. , _  between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "other regions of the host galaxy appear redder in the @xmath32 color map in fig .",
    "[ mrk1014mos ] .",
    "these regions , sampled by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , appear to be dominated by an older , @xmath28 gyr population , and to have very little , if any , contribution from the old underlying population ( fig .",
    "[ mrk1014older ] , top panel ) .",
    "it is not entirely clear whether these are truly intermediate age populations , or if they are simply , as in the case of region @xmath41 , dominated by an old underlying population with a very small contribution from a younger population like those found in regions @xmath33 through @xmath36 .",
    "we attempted to fit models with the latter characteristics to the observed spectra .",
    "the resulting fits are reasonable , with minimum values of @xmath26 10% and 25% larger than that obtained for a dominant intermediate - age population for regions @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ mrk1014older ] shows the spectrum of region @xmath39 with the best fit to the data of the sum of an old underlying population and a 250 myr instantaneous burst population .",
    "while a reasonable fit , it does show significant discrepancies in the region around the 4000    break and the @xmath42 line .",
    "the potential presence of this intermediate age population suggests that a better fit for the younger populations might be achieved by adding a third component that accounts for this intermediate age component .",
    "however the flux of the young starburst population in those regions is so dominant ( typically contributing 80% of the total flux at rest - frame 5000  ) , that a third component makes a negligible difference to the fit .",
    "region @xmath43 shows very strong emission , which almost certainly comes from gas ionized by the qso rather than from star - forming regions .",
    "the equivalent widths of the emission lines here are greater than those of the emission lines elsewhere in the galaxy by at least a factor of 5 , and at least twice those of the qso nucleus for [ ] .",

    "the underlying spectrum is similar to that of region @xmath41 .",
    "region @xmath41 also shows emission lines with approaching velocities of @xmath45 km s@xmath5 with respect to the stellar features , but this region shows an additional , weaker emission component clearly visible in [ ] , [ ] , and h@xmath46 , blueshifted by @xmath47 km s@xmath5 with respect to the stronger component .",
    "the stellar population here seems to be dominated by an old population with a small fraction of the flux coming from younger stars .",
    "we have added spectra from two different slit positions at region @xmath48 to improve the signal to noise in this very faint region .",
    "this is part of the long extension on the west side clearly seen in the high contrast image in fig .",
    "[ mrk1014mos ] .",
    "we find a continuum with a red sed and a clear 4000   break at a redshift close to , but slightly larger than that of the main body of the galaxy .",
    "region @xmath49 , which is very bright in the @xmath50 image in fig .",
    "[ mrk1014mos ] , would appear to be an extension of the east tail .",
    "however , its spectrum shows that it is a background galaxy at @xmath51 .",
    "likewise , region @xmath52 on the west tail is a galaxy at @xmath53 .",
    "a third galaxy se of the qso ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) has a similar redshift as well ( @xmath56 ) , so there seems to be a group or cluster of galaxies at this redshift .",
    "the 200 s exposure spectrum of the elongated object 92 west - southwest of the qso shows narrow emission lines at the same redshift as the qso superposed on a red continuum .",
    "2@xmath37 of @xcite shows that there is strong emission just north of this object coming from extended gas ionized by the qso and not necessarily associated with the object .",
    "the spectrum is too noisy to distinguish stellar features , so it is unclear whether this object is interacting with the system or if it is a chance projection .",
    "the near edge - on galaxy @xmath57west of the qso , on the other hand , shows [ ] emission confined to the galaxy at @xmath58 in a university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope spectrum ( canalizo 2000 , unpublished ) , as suggested by @xcite from their [ ] imaging .",
    "how do our results compare to those of @xcite ? as mentioned above , nolan et al .",
    "use a fixed 0.1 gyr starburst population .",
    "they determine that this population makes up 1.1% of the total luminous mass along the line of sight , and that the rest of the flux is well characterized by a 12 gyr instantaneous burst .",
    "in contrast , we find several regions of recent ( @xmath59 gyr ) star formation where the star forming mass typically amounts to 12% , and sometimes up to 30% , of the total luminous mass along the line of sight .",
    "one of our slit positions is very similar to one used by nolan et al.(see fig .  2 in @xcite ) , but our slit is narrower and slightly closer to the nucleus . as a way to compare , we added the flux along the slit as nolan et al .  seem to have done , including the background galaxy @xmath49 , which is also in their slit .",
    "even if we add up all the flux along this slit ( subtracting the qso light , which amounted to 5% of the total flux ) , we still find that the star forming regions make up 8% of the total luminous mass along the line of sight .",
    "obviously , the difference in ages will lead to a smaller percentage for their choice of parameters .",
    "so , we tried fixing our parameters to match theirs ( _ i.e. ,",
    "_  12 gyr + 0.1 gyr populations ) , and this yields a 5% by mass for the young population , but the fit is much inferior to the ones discussed in this section .",
    "their slit position may have fortuitously missed the major star forming regions , thus leading to this smaller percentage . we have previously cautioned ( cs2000 ) that different slit positions can lead to different age determinations , and we emphasize the importance of carefully selecting slit positions if one wishes ( as we do ) to find the major starburst regions .",
    "it is also far more difficult to obtain a reliable age for an older population in the presence of a contaminating younger population than the reverse .",
    "images of mrk1014 show a very prominent tail extending to the northeast , reminiscent of the tidal tail of 3c48 ( cs2000 ) . like the tidal tail in 3c48 ,",
    "this tail has a number of small clumps ( see _ hst _ image in fig .",
    "[ mrk1014hst ] ) of star formation , which are commonly found in merging systems .",
    "the bulk of the bright portion of the tail appears to be dominated by an intermediate age population ( @xmath141 gyr ) with a very small contribution , if any , from an old underlying population ; alternatively , it could be dominated by an older population , with some flux scattered from the bright star - forming regions ( @xmath33 through @xmath37 ) or fainter small regions distributed along the host",
    ". however , the north edge of the tail appears as a very sharp feature in the short wavelength images , and contains stellar populations which are as young as those of the clumps .",
    "as we find no redshift variations along this edge , it would appear that we are observing the tail nearly face - on , and that this is the leading edge where the material has been compressed , thus producing star formation .",
    "this , again , is similar to the blue leading edge observed in 3c48 ( fig .",
    "2@xmath36 in cs2000 ) , presumably sharper in mrk1014 because of the lower inclination angle .",
    "both the ground - based and the _ hst _ images of mrk1014 ( figs .",
    "[ mrk1014mos ] and [ mrk1014hst ] ) show a long , low - surface - brightness extension of the bright tail on the east of the nucleus and arching towards the south ( more evident after the removal of the background galaxy , @xmath49 ) as well a very extended faint secondary tail , rotationally symmetric to the bright ( primary ) tail .",
    "each tail extends for as much as @xmath60   or @xmath14100 kpc ( note the inset in fig .  [ mrk1014mos ] showing the well - known local interacting system m51/ngc5195 at the same scale ) .",
    "spectra of the secondary tail west of the nucleus indicates that the tail is made up by older stars , and this is consistent with this tail being visible in our @xmath61 ( not shown ) and @xmath62 images .",
    "no bright clumps of star formation are evident along the secondary tail ; this absence is not unusual as tidal dwarf formation appears not to be a ubiquitous process in mergers @xcite .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "image of the nucleus ( see inset in fig .  [ mrk1014hst ] ) shows a small extension on the south side which follows the direction of the secondary tidal tail .",
    "a similar extension is seen in _",
    "hst nicmos _",
    "images by @xcite .",
    "there appears to be a `` bulge '' or enhanced brightness area elongated roughly along the axis connecting the beginning of both tails ( _ i.e. , _",
    "se ) , with a half radius of @xmath63 kpc . assuming a projected velocity of 300 km s@xmath5 on the plane of the sky , the dynamical age for the tails is @xmath64 myr .",
    "the tails are then older than every major post - starburst knot they contain , consistent with the idea that the latter were formed after the tails were first launched . at the same time , the tails are dynamically younger than the bulk of the stars that form them , though perhaps only slightly so if the stellar populations observed in @xmath39 and @xmath40 are truly @xmath28 gyr old , instead of being @xmath65 gyr with a small admixture of younger stars .",
    "mrk1014 shows some striking similarities to 3c48 ( cs2000 ) : the morphology of the ( primary ) tidal tail , the clumps of star formation along the tail as well as its blue leading edge , the relation of the starburst ages to the dynamical age of the tails ( both ages @xmath66 myr younger in 3c48 ) , and the clumpy extended emission line region @xcite with high velocity ( @xmath67 km s@xmath5 ) components . as with 3c48 ,",
    "the data strongly suggest that mrk1014 is the result of a merger of two galaxies of comparable size , both of which were disks in this case .",
    "the starbursts in the main body of the host of mrk1014 , however , appear to be less intense and less widespread than those of 3c48 .",
    "if the intermediate age ( 1 gyr ) population we see in regions @xmath39 and @xmath40 is real , it may be the relic of a starburst ignited at an initial passage of the two interacting galaxies .",
    "indeed , we know of another system ( unj1025@xmath680040 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where the interacting galaxies have a difference in starburst ages of this order , possibly coincident with their orbital period .",
    "if this were the case for mrk1014 , one might expect most of the star formation at the present to be very strongly concentrated towards the nucleus , as most of the gas would have been driven towards the center starting @xmath28 gyr ago .",
    "the luminous , @xmath69 , radio - quiet qso iras07598 + 6508 was first detected by _ iras _ , identified as an agn candidate by @xcite , and spectroscopically identified as a qso by @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum of the qso is dominated by extremely strong emission @xcite , and the uv spectrum shows low- and high - ionization broad absorption lines ( bal ) extending to blueshifts of 5200 to 22000 km s@xmath70 @xcite .",
    "figures [ ir0759mos ] and [ ir0759hst ] show , respectively , ground - based and _ hst _ images of iras07598 + 6508 ( see * ? ? ? * for a psf - subtracted version of the _ hst _ image ) .",
    "these images show two clumpy regions @xmath71  south and southeast of the qso , bright in the psf subtracted @xmath16 image , but barely visible in @xmath61-band images ( not shown ) .",

    "mrk231 is unusual in that there seems to be a significant post - starburst population somewhat older ( 300360 myr ) than the tails , which may indicate that wide spread star formation was ignited prior to the stages of final merger .",
    "numerical simulations of mergers @xcite predict such a scenario when the merging galaxies lack a significant bulge to stabilize them against an early dissipation .",
    "in cs2000 we noted that the apparent correlation between bulge mass and black - hole mass @xcite suggests a possible correlation between qso luminosity and the delay in star formation activity .",
    "thus , the early starburst activity in mrk231 may indicate that the host galaxy did not have a substantial bulge , which would in turn imply a less massive black - hole that may result into a less luminous agn .",

    "we have found evidence that all three objects have undergone a strong interaction and are now in the final stages of mergers .",
    "the morphology of the hosts ( highly perturbed galaxies with tidal tails and destroyed disks ) as well as the extent of the starbursts indicate that these are all major mergers between galaxies of comparable mass rather than accretion events of low mass dwarf companions @xcite .",
    "all three objects show spectra typical of e+a galaxies @xcite , that is , spectra characterized by the simultaneous presence of strong balmer absorption lines indicative of a young stellar population and features from an older population such as , and the absence of strong emission lines typical of star forming galaxies ( we reiterate that the emission lines seen in our spectra generally come from extended gas ionized by the qso rather than from star forming regions , with a few exceptions ) .",

    "* ) . in the case of objects with e+a spectra undergoing tidal interactions ,",
    "the young superposed population is clearly related to the interaction .",
    "the three objects discussed in this paper , along with 3c48 ( cs2000 ) and pg1700 + 518 ( cs97 ) , all have interaction - induced starbursts .",
    "in addition to the similarities noted in the host galaxies of the three objects , there are also some common characteristics in the spectra of the active nuclei themselves .",
    "all three objects show strong emission , with two of these objects ( iras07598 + 6508 and mrk231 ) being `` extreme '' emitters ( _ i.e. , _  showing ratios of @xmath115(feii @xmath116)/@xmath115(h@xmath46 ) @xmath117 2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the latter two objects , like pg1700 + 518 ( cs97 ; scc98 ) , are also low - ionization bal qsos and have weak or absent narrow emission lines .",
    "how do the ages of these starbursts relate to the merger / interaction stage ?",
    "the dynamical ages for tidal features in these objects are uncertain because of projection effects .",
    "however , our rough estimates indicate that in two cases , mrk1014 and iras07598 + 6508 , the peak of the starburst occurred after the tidal tails were launched .",
    "this requires some mechanism to stabilize the gas contents of the galaxies against bursting in star formation until the later stages of the merger ; numerical simulations indicate that a significant bulge in the host can provide this mechanism @xcite .",
    "mrk231 , on the other hand , shows starburst ages which indicate that much of the star formation activity may have started before the last stages of the merger ; hence , one or both of the merging galaxies may have lacked a significant bulge .    whenever we have found a significant range of starburst ages in the host galaxies of qsos , we have also found evidence that the youngest major starburst regions are preferentially concentrated towards the center of the galaxy . in 3c48 ( cs2000 )",
    "we found the clearest example of this , with starburst ages becoming progressively younger and more dominating as we approached the galaxy / qso nucleus .",
    "mrk231 shows older starbursts in the `` plateau '' extending @xmath118 kpc around the nucleus , with some of the youngest populations only 3 kpc from the nucleus , and possibly even younger populations in the central kpc of the galaxy .",
    "mrk1014 shows stronger relatively recent star formation activity along the tail than any of the other objects . however , the starburst region we observe within 2 kpc of the nucleus is far more massive , luminous , and larger @xcite than the starburst regions along the tail , and has the youngest age found in the host .",
    "the interaction histories of the five objects discussed so far clearly favor a strong connection between interactions and vigorous bursts of star formation .",
    "since the gas flows towards the inner regions can not only trigger star formation but also serve as fuel to the qso , one might expect the age of the qso activity to be closely related to the age of the initial starbursts in the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "however , observations of central starbursts are in every case hampered by the presence of the qso ; even if this region could be observed , the spectrum would likely be dominated by continuing recent starburst activity and not by a starburst that was coincident with the onset of the qso activity .",
    "furthermore , both starburst and qso activity may be episodic .",
    "all of this is to say that there is an unavoidable intrinsic uncertainty in using starburst ages to place qsos in an evolutionary sequence .",
    "we defer the detailed discussion of a possible age sequence to a subsequent paper where we will present the results of the four remaining objects in our sample ( _ i.e. , _",
    "iras00275@xmath682859 , iras04505@xmath682958 , izw1 , and pg1543 + 489 ) .",
    "we emphasize , though , that many of our general conclusions from the objects discussed here , as well as from our observations of 3c48 ( cs2000 ) , have an interest that is quite independent of any attempt to use some sort of starburst age as a proxy for a qso age .",
    "( 1 ) the confirmation that these are all starburst or post - starburst objects and that they all show obvious tidal tails validates their close connection with other uligs , virtually all of which are mergers or strongly interacting pairs .",
    "while there has long been strong _ circumstantial _ evidence that a large fraction of the qso population has resulted from triggering of the qso activity by interactions and mergers , we now have much more direct evidence for this mechanism for at least one subclass of qsos .",
    "( 2 ) both the spatial distribution and the time history of star formation in a qso host galaxy give clues to nature of the galaxies that have participated in the merger .",
    "while more sophisticated models of star formation during interactions will be necessary to exploit these data fully , we already have some hints in terms of the enhanced star formation along the leading edge of the tails in 3c48 and mrk1014 , and in the relative ages of the tail structures and the star - forming regions contained within them .",
    "( 3 ) the youth of the stellar populations in these objects reinforces previous suggestions connecting strong emission and low - ionization bal features with the relatively recent triggering of qso activity .",

    "<S> we present deep spectroscopic and imaging data of the host galaxies of mrk1014 , iras07598 + 6508 , and mrk231 . </S>",
    "<S> these objects form part of both the qso and the ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulig ) families , and may represent a transition stage in an evolutionary scenario . </S>",
    "<S> our imaging shows that all three objects have highly perturbed hosts with tidal tails and destroyed disks , and appear to be in the final stages of major mergers . </S>",
    "<S> the host galaxies of the three objects have spectra typical of e+a galaxies , showing simultaneously features from an old and a young stellar component . </S>",
    "<S> we model spectra from different regions of the host galaxies using @xcite spectral synthesis models using two component models including an old underlying population and recent superposed starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> mrk1014 has intense star formation concentrated in a large knot @xmath0 kpc from the nucleus , along the leading edge of the tidal tail , and in several knots scattered around the host . </S>",
    "<S> the starburst ages in these regions range from 180 to 290 myr . </S>",
    "<S> iras 07598 + 6508 has multiple knots of star formation concentrated in two regions within 16 kpc of the qso nucleus , with ages ranging from 30 to 70 myr ; the host galaxy shows an older population in other regions . </S>",
    "<S> mrk231 shows a wider range of starburst ages , ranging from 42 myr in the arc 3 kpc south of the nucleus , to @xmath1 myr spread on a `` plateau '' @xmath2 kpc across around the nucleus , as well as a uv bright region 12 kpc south of the nucleus , which is apparently a region of currently active star formation . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate a strong connection between interactions and vigorous bursts of star formation in these objects . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the starburst ages found are indicative of young ages for the qso activity . </S>",
    "<S> the young starburst ages found are also consistent with the intermediate position of these objects in the far infrared color - color diagram . </S>"
