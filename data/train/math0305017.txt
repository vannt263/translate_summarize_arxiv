    "-5 mm    a widely adopted setting for  arbitrage - free \" financial markets is as follows : one models the price dynamics of primitive assets by a vector semimartingale , takes the saving account ( or bond ) as numeraire , and assumes that there exists an equivalent local martingale measure for the deflated price process of assets .",
    "according to the fundamental theorem of asset pricing ( ftap , for short ) , due to kreps ( 1981 ) and delbaen and schachermayer ( 1994 ) if the deflated price process is locally bounded , this assumption is equivalent to the condition of  no free lunch with vanishing risk \" ( nflvr for short ) .",
