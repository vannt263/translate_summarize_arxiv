    "the reason why we prefer a bound in @xmath0 and @xmath1 rather than in the ` volume ' of the system @xmath28 , will be clarified later .    a first naive ( and wrong ) idea to do so consists in choosing the position ( the energy level ) of a first , second ,    and eventually @xmath29 particle in the following way .",
    "first choose randomly the position of the first particle according to the exponential weights associated with the ` free entropies ' of the empty sites , that is choose level @xmath30 with a probability proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "then decrease by  1 the degeneracy of the chosen energy level and repeat the procedure to choose the position of the second , third ,    and eventually @xmath29 particle .",

    "@xmath20 associated with the different energy levels , that is of the numbers of particles placed in each level , is in general not given by @xmath18 as soon as @xmath0 is larger than one .",

    "very classically , the fast sampling performed by the algorithm we will build will be obtained by running a markov chain @xmath32 with transition matrix  @xmath33 on @xmath34 and with equilibrium measure @xmath18 .",

    "this markov chain is certainly irreducible and aperiodic . to prove that it relaxes to @xmath18 we will check the reversibility of the process with respect to @xmath18",
    ". then we will have to estimate the mixing time of the process .",
    "we will carry out both the tasks in a more general setup .      for any function @xmath66",
    "we define @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 and we say that a measure @xmath70 on the integers @xmath71 with @xmath72 , is log - concave if @xmath73 is an interval of the integers and @xmath74 i.e. , if @xmath75 is non - increasing , or , equivalently , @xmath76 is non - negative ( with the obvious extension of the previous definitions to such a possibly non - finite @xmath77 ) .",
    "the measure @xmath12 defined in ( [ defmu ] ) is a product of log - concave measures and the canonical fermi statistics is such a product measure normalized over the condition ( [ canonical ] ) .",
    "_ from now on , and except for explicit mentioning of additional hypotheses , we will only assume that the probability measure @xmath18 we want to sample is a product of log - concave measures normalized over the global constraint ( [ canonical ] ) , i.e. , that @xmath18 is a probability on @xmath34 that can be written in the form ( [ defnu ] ) with non - increasing @xmath78 s . _    in this more general setup we will often refer to the indices @xmath30 in @xmath47 as _ sites _ rather than energy levels of the system .",
    "actually the @xmath79 s of the fermi statistics are much more than log - concave measures .",
    "they are _ ultra log - concave _ measures according to the following definition by pemantle @xcite and liggett @xcite .    a measure @xmath80 is _ ultra log - concave _ if @xmath81 is log - concave .    in other words",
    "@xmath79 is ultra log - concave if and only if @xmath82 is non - increasing ( for the fermi statistics observe that so are the @xmath23 s and that ( [ defpsi2 ] ) is consistent with ( [ defpsi1 ] ) ) .    for birth and death processes that are reversible with respect to ultra log - concave measures , caputo , dai pra and posta  @xcite proved modified log - sobolev inequalities and stronger convex entropy decays , both giving good upper bounds on the mixing time of the processes .",
    "johnson  @xcite proved also easier poincar inequalities that give weaker bounds on the mixing times .",
    "we refer to  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for an introduction to this classical functional inequality approach to convergence to equilibrium and we note that for such birth and death processes the ultra - log concavity hypotheses allowed for a bakry - mery like approach ( see  @xcite ) to derive ( modified ) log - sobolev inequalities . actually ,  @xcite was an attempt to extend this celebrated analysis to markov processes with jumps ( see also  @xcite for a more geometric perspective ) .",
    "but it turns out , as we will soon review , that beyond the case of birth and death processes the role of ultra log - concavity to follow the bakry - mery line in the discrete setup is still unclear .    in this paper",
    "we will not follow the functional analysis approach to control mixing times . to bound from above the mixing time of a markov chain that is reversible with respect to a conditional product of ultra log - concave measures , we will follow ( and recall in section  [ pt1 ] ) the non less classical , and , in this case , elementary , probabilistic approach via coalescent coupling .",

    "our estimate does not depend on the temperature , and , more generally it is independent from the energy values as well as the level degeneracies .",
    "to illustrate this fact let us start with the case @xmath85 for all @xmath30 . in this case",
    "our dynamics is a simple exclusion process with site disorder .",
    "caputo ( @xcite , @xcite ) proved poincar inequalities for such processes , in their continuous time version , assuming a uniform lower ( and upper ) bound on general transition rates , while caputo , dai pra and posta  @xcite , looking at particular rates for the process and still assuming moderate disorder  that is , uniform lower and upper bounds on these rates  proved a modified log - sobolev inequality . for",
    "the particular choice of rates they made , the upper bound on the mixing time implied by  @xcite could not hold in a strong disorder context ( for example with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) .",
    "our uniformity over the disorder of the system depends then strongly on our particular choice for the transition probabilities .",
    "as it is often the case with markov processes on discrete state space , the details of the dynamics are not less important than the properties of its equilibrium measure .    under the moderate disorder hypotheses of  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    ", however , the upper bound on the mixing time implied by  @xcite and suggested by  @xcite , @xcite is better than our upper bound in theorem  [ thm1 ] ( by a factor of order @xmath0 ) .",
    "but we will see that introducing such moderate disorder hypotheses in our arguments directly improves our result by a factor of order @xmath91 ( see the last remark at the end of section  [ pt1 ] ) .    to close the discussion on simple exclusion processes we note that those of the arguments in  @xcite that do not depend on the disorder suggest an upper bound on the mixing time of order @xmath92 .",
    "theorem  [ thm1 ] improves this estimate when @xmath0 is small with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "as far as more general conditional non - homogeneous product of log - concave measures are concerned , we stress once again that theorem  [ thm1 ] gives a uniform bound over the disorder that can be improved by a factor of order @xmath1 by adding moderate disorder hypotheses ( see the last remark at the end of section  [ last ] and our simulation appendix )",
    ". then , such product measures can be equilibrium measures of zero - range processes with a continuous time generator as in  @xcite , @xcite : @xmath93 where the @xmath94 are such that @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "indeed , such a process is reversible with respect to @xmath18 provided that @xmath98 boudou , caputo , dai pra and posta @xcite proved a poincar inequality for such a process , assuming that there exists a positive @xmath99 such that @xmath100 this is a moderate disorder hypothesis that implies the log - concavity of the @xmath101 . to go to modified log - sobolev inequalities , i.e. , to good mixing time estimates rather than simple gap estimates",
    ", there is the additional hypothesis in  @xcite that there exists a non - negative @xmath102 such that @xmath103 clearly there are ultra log - concave measures that do not satisfy  ( [ cn2 ] ) : to have an ultra log - concave measure one needs a strongly decreasing @xmath78 , i.e. , a strongly increasing @xmath104 .",
    "conversely , it is not true that  ( [ cn1 ] ) and  ( [ cn2 ] ) imply ultra log - concavity , i.e. , @xmath105 however , elementary algebra shows that  ( [ cn1 ] ) together with  ( [ cn2 ] ) implies @xmath106 and this strangely looks like  ( [ ulc ] ) .",
    "therefore we said that the role played by ultra log - concavity is still unclear along the functional analysis line of research in the discrete setup .",
    "we conclude stressing once again that in this paper we will follow a different line , that our uniform bound on the mixing time comes from an elementary coupling argument and that we do not need any moderate disorder hypothesis .",
    "it seems that today available techniques are such that the less log - concavity we have , the more homogeneity we need to control the convergence to equilibrium . staying to the papers mentioned above , without ultra log - concavity or at least something that looks like ultra log - concavity we only have poincar inequalities for non - homogeneous product of log - concave measures , and without log - concavity we have modified log - sobolev inequalities for homogeneous product measures only ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the only result we know for a conservative dynamics in ( weakly ) disordered context and with an equilibrium measure that is a product of measures that are not log - concave is that of landim and noronha neto  @xcite for the ( continuous ) ginzburg - landau process .",
    "we will see that all the ideas of the proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] can be extended to deal with a large class of conditional product of log - concave measures that are not ultra log - concave .",
    "to do so , let us define @xmath107 : \\ :      \\forall j \\in \\{1;\\cdots;m\\},\\ ,      \\forall k_j > 0,\\ ,      - \\delta_{k_j}\\phi_j \\geq \\lambda\\ln\\frac{1 + k_j}{k_j }    \\right\\}.    \\label{dfndelta}\\ ] ] in other words , @xmath108 is the largest real number in @xmath109 $ ] for which all the @xmath110 } : = \\nabla^+\\phi_j + \\delta\\ln(1+\\cdot ) ,",

    "* remark 2 : * as far as this can make sense in our discrete setup , we note that the hypothesis @xmath119 is slightly weaker than a `` uniform strict log - concavity hypothesis '' ( see  ( [ dfndelta ] ) ) .",
    "* proof of theorem 2 : * see section  [ pt2 ] .",
    "for @xmath120 the transition matrix represents an algorithm starting with a uniform choice of a particle . for @xmath121 theorem  [ thm2 ]",
    "is empty but  ( [ defp2a])-([defp2b ] ) still define a markov chain @xmath32 that can be seen as a particular version of a discrete state space non - homogeneous ginzburg - landau process . in this case",
    "the transition matrix represents an algorithm that starts with a uniform choice of a ( non - empty ) site .",
    "the case @xmath122 can be seen as an interpolation between uniform choices of site and particle .",
    "more precisely , assuming that at time @xmath42 the system is in some configuration @xmath123 in @xmath124 , the configuration at time @xmath49 can be decided as follows .",
    "* choose a site @xmath46 or no site at all with probabilities proportional to @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "* if some site @xmath46 was chosen , then proceed as in the previously described algorithm using the functions @xmath127}$ ] instead of the @xmath128 s , if not , then set @xmath57 .",
    "first , we note that as long as one wants bounds that are uniform over the disorder , theorem 1 gives the right order for the mixing time : for the fermi statistic in the very low temperature regime with , for example , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , the equilibrium measure will be concentrated on @xmath131 while , starting from @xmath132 , the system will reach the ground state in a time of order @xmath2 for large @xmath0 ( this is a coupon - collector estimate ) .",
    "this fact is illustrated in our simulation appendix .",
    "next , we observe that , with our definitions , @xmath133 can often be close to one , especially in strong disorder situations or when the right and left hand sides in  ( [ holder ] ) are far from each other .",
    "if one would like to use these results to perform practical simulations , then it could be useful to note that the computational time would still be improved by implementing an algorithm that at each step simulates , for a given configuration @xmath134 on the trajectory of the markov chain , the elapsed time before the particle reach a _ different _ configuration ( this is a geometric time ) and choose this configuration @xmath135 according to the ( easy to compute ) associated law .",
    "it would then be enough to stop the algorithm as soon as the total simulated time goes beyond the mixing time ( and then return the last configuration , that the system occupied at the mixing time ) rather than waiting for the original algorithm to make a step number equal to the mixing time .    turning back to the first naive and wrong idea",
    ", it is interesting to note that it can easily be modified to determine the most probable states of the system , i.e. , the configurations @xmath136 in @xmath34 such that @xmath137 one can prove , using the concavity of the @xmath23 s , that the most probable configurations for the system with @xmath0 particles can be obtained from the most probable configurations @xmath138 for the system with @xmath139 particles simply adding one particle where the corresponding gain in ` free energy ' is the highest , that is in @xmath140 such that @xmath141 as a consequence one can place the particles one by one , each time maximizing this free energy gain , to build the most probable configuration .",
    "then , as a referee pointed out , since the sampling problem is a trivial one in the poissonian case ( when all the @xmath101 s are poisson measures , so that @xmath18 is nothing but a multinomial law @xmath142 ) , one can ask about the expected time needed to perform a rejection sampling with respect to the multinomial case .",
    "it is given by @xmath143 .",
    "if we take the fermi statistics with @xmath144 and all the @xmath145 equal to 1 , then we find ( optimizing on the multinomial parameters by a geometric / arithmetic mean comparison ) @xmath146 . of course , the sampling problem for that fermi statistics is also a trivial one .",
    "but if we take @xmath147 and all the @xmath145 equal to 2 , it is not anymore a trivial problem and we find an expected time for the rejection sampling that is logarithmically equivalent to @xmath148 .",
    "turning back to the fermi statistics we now explain why we were interested in bounds in @xmath0 and @xmath1 rather than in the volume @xmath149 .",
    "iovanella , scoppola and scoppola defined in  @xcite an algorithm to individuate cliques ( i.e. , complete subgraphs ) with @xmath0 vertices inside a large erds - reyni random graph with @xmath149 vertices .",
    "their algorithm requires to perform repeated approximate samplings of fermi statistics in volume @xmath149 , with @xmath0 particles and @xmath150 energy levels .",
    "now , the key observation is that the largest cliques in erds - reyni graphs with @xmath149 vertices are of order @xmath151 , so that @xmath0 and @xmath1 in this problem are logarithmically small with respect to @xmath149 . before theorem  [ thm1 ]",
    "the samplings for their algorithm were done by running simple exclusion processes with @xmath0 particles on the complete graph ( with site disorder ) of size @xmath149 .",
    "such processes converge to equilibrium in a time of order @xmath152 .",
    "now the samplings are done in a time of order @xmath153 , and that was the original motivation of the present work .    finally we note that our bound in @xmath0 and @xmath1 is not only useful when @xmath0 is small with respect to @xmath149 but also when @xmath0 is close to @xmath149 . in this case",
    "we can define a dynamics on the @xmath154 vacancies rather than on the @xmath0 particles .",
    "in this section we assume that @xmath18 is a measure on @xmath34 deriving from a product of ultra log - concave measures , which means that we can write @xmath155 and , for all @xmath156 , @xmath128 defined by  ( [ defpsi2 ] ) is non - increasing .",

    "the horizontal line stands for our theoretical upper bound.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we can now conclude with a few comments . first , with such a procedure , @xmath35 is essentially underestimated . indeed , except for the replacement of @xmath460 and @xmath18 by @xmath502 and @xmath503 our successive approximations underestimated @xmath173 then @xmath35 .",
    "as a consequence we recover with case  2 that @xmath504 is the best upper bound on @xmath35 that is uniform over the disorder .",
    "second , we note that @xmath3 can be seen as a tuning parameter for the disorder .",
    "we recover that our theoretical estimate on @xmath35 can be improved by a factor of order @xmath1 in weak disorder situations .",
    "last , it is worth to note that case  1 suggests that @xmath35 is not generally decreasing with the temperature . in our preliminary simulations",
    "we only considered @xmath505 to estimate the mixing time .",
    "then we feared that our non monotonic estimation could be an artefact of our simulation .",
    "this led us to introduce the alternative saturated low level starting configuration , confirming in that way the non - monotonicity .",
