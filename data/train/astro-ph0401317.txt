    "type i x - ray bursts from accreting neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries involve unstable thermonuclear burning of accreted hydrogen ( h ) and helium ( he ) ( lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1995 ) . in the last few years , long term monitoring of x - ray bursters by bepposax and the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) has revealed a new class of very energetic type i x - ray bursts , now known as `` superbursts '' ( see strohmayer & bildsten 2003 ; kuulkers 2003 for reviews ) .",
    "the @xmath4 energies and several hour durations of superbursts are @xmath5@xmath6 times greater than usual type i bursts .",
    "in addition , they are rare : so far 8 have been seen from 7 sources , with recurrence times not well - constrained , but estimated as @xmath7 year ( kuulkers 2002 ; in t zand et al .",
    "2003 ; wijnands 2001 ) , instead of hours to days for usual type i bursts .",
    "the current picture is that superbursts are due to unstable ignition of carbon at densities @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "hydrogen and helium burn at @xmath10@xmath11 via the rp - process ( wallace & woosley 1981 ) , producing chiefly heavy elements beyond the iron group ( including nuclei as massive as @xmath12 ; schatz et al .",
    "2001 ) , but with some residual carbon ( mass fraction @xmath13@xmath14 ) ( schatz et al .  2003 ) .",
    "cumming & bildsten ( 2001 ) ( hereafter cb01 ) showed that this small amount of carbon can ignite unstably once the mass of the ash layer reaches @xmath15 ( see also strohmayer & brown 2002 ) .",
    "this fits well with observed superburst energies for @xmath16 and an energy release from the nuclear burning of 1 mev per nucleon .",
    "the low thermal conductivity of the rp - process ashes gives a large temperature gradient and ignition at the required mass ( cb01 ) .",
    "the heavy nuclei may also photodisintegrate to iron group during the flash , enhancing the nuclear energy release ( schatz , bildsten , & cumming 2003 ) .",
    "therefore superbursts offer an opportunity to study the rp - process ashes .",
    "previous authors used one - zone models to estimate the time - dependence of the flash ( cb01 ; strohmayer & brown 2002 ) . in this paper , we present the first multi - zone models of the cooling phase of superbursts . unlike normal type i bursts ,",
    "the time to burn the fuel is much less than the convective turnover time .",
    "we therefore assume that the fuel burns locally and instantaneously in place , without significant vertical mixing .",
    "we do not calculate ignition conditions , but rather treat the amount of energy deposited and the thickness of the fuel layer as free parameters . in  2 , we describe our calculations of the subsequent thermal evolution of the layer , and present a simple analytic model which helps to understand the numerical results . at late times",
    ", the flux evolves as a power law in time rather than the exponential decay found by cb01 for a one - zone model . in  3 , we use the long term flux evolution of the layer to predict the timescale of quenching of type i bursts after the superburst , and compare to observations .",
    "after the fuel burns , the cooling of the layer is described by the entropy equation @xmath17 where the heat flux is @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the neutrino energy loss rate .",
    "the layer remains in hydrostatic balance , in which case a useful independent coordinate is the column depth @xmath20 into the star ( units : @xmath21 ) , where @xmath22 , giving a pressure @xmath23 .",
    "the surface gravity is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the gravitational redshift factor . in this paper , we assume @xmath26 and @xmath27 , giving @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "to find the temperature profile just after the fuel burns , we deposit an energy @xmath30 throughout the layer .",
    "since carbon burning to iron gives @xmath31 , we expect @xmath32 to correspond to @xmath33@xmath14 , depending on how much energy is contributed by photodisintegration ( schatz et al .",
    "2003 ) . at each depth",
    ", we calculate the temperature of the layer , @xmath34 , from @xmath35 , where @xmath36 the initial temperature .",
    "following cb01 , a simple analytic estimate of @xmath34 is as follows .",
    "the electrons are degenerate and relativistic for @xmath37 , giving @xmath38 , fermi energy @xmath39 , and pressure scale height @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "the heat capacity @xmath42 is determined mainly by the electrons , @xmath43 . integrating and assuming @xmath44 , we find the convectively stable temperature profile @xmath45 , insensitive to depth and depending mainly on @xmath46 .",
    "our thermal evolution code uses the method of lines , in which the right hand side of equation ( 1 ) is differenced over a spatial grid , and the resulting set of ordinary differential equations integrated using a stiff integrator .",
    "we choose a uniform grid in @xmath47 , which concentrates grid points around the base of the layer @xmath48 , resolving the initial temperature discontinuity .",
    "we place the outer boundary at @xmath49 , and set flux @xmath50 there ; at the inner boundary , typically @xmath51 , we assume vanishing flux .",
    "we assume the layer is heated before the flash by a @xmath52 flux from the crust , and that all the fuel burns to @xmath53fe .",
    "our results are not sensitive to the details of the grid , or boundary conditions ( for times longer than the thermal time at the top zone ) .",
    "we calculate the equation of state , opacity , neutrino emissivity , and heat capacity as described by schatz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows temperature and flux profiles 10 minutes , 1 hour , 1 day , and 10 days after ignition for a model with @xmath32 and @xmath54 .",
    "figure 2 shows a series of lightcurves for different @xmath48 and @xmath46 . at early times , as the outer parts of the layer thermally adjust , the radiative flux depends mostly on @xmath46 . at late times",
    ", after the cooling wave reaches the base of the layer , the flux depends mostly on @xmath48 , and falls off as a power law @xmath3 .",
    "figure 3 shows the cumulative energy release for @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath32@xmath57 . in the first few hours , the energy released from the surface is @xmath58 , the exact value being mainly sensitive to @xmath46 , rather than depth .",
    "a significant fraction of the heat is initially conducted inwards and released on a longer timescale , as pointed out by strohmayer & brown ( 2002 ) .",
    "the physical reason for the late - time power law flux decay is that as time evolves , the peak of the temperature profile moves to greater depths where the thermal timescale to the surface is longer ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the simplest analytic model is a slab with constant thermal diffusivity @xmath59 , whose temperature is perturbed close to the surface , for example at a depth @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the surface ) . for a delta - function perturbation",
    "initially , the temperature evolution is given by the green s function .",
    "eichler & cheng ( 1989 ) derive a similar result for a power law dependence of conductivity on depth , which also shows self - similar behavior at late times ( see lyubarsky , eichler , & thompson 2002 for a recent application to cooling of sgr 1900 + 14 after an outburst ) . ] @xmath62 and the surface flux is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the thermal time at the initial heating depth @xmath65 . for an initial `` top hat '' temperature profile @xmath66 , @xmath67 ,",
    "the surface flux is @xmath68 $ ] . for @xmath69 , before the cooling wave reaches the base of the layer , @xmath70 ; for @xmath71 , the solution is independent of the initial temperature profile , and @xmath72 .",
    "the numerical results show a similar behavior , although with different power law indices .",
    "the relevant timescale in this case is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "the electron conductivity is @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the electron collision frequency .",
    "when electrons dominate the heat capacity , the thermal diffusivity takes the particularly simple temperature - independent form @xmath78 . for electron - ion collisions , @xmath79 ( e.g.  see appendix of schatz et al .",
    "1999 ) , giving @xmath80 ( see also eq .  [",
    "10 ] of cb01 ) , where we insert the appropriate numbers for @xmath53fe composition .",
    "the simple `` top hat '' solution for constant conductivity motivates a fit to the numerical solutions , @xmath81,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 . for @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the transition from @xmath85 to @xmath86 occurs when @xmath87",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : fit ] ) fits the numerical results to better than a factor of two for models without substantial neutrino emission .",
    "as emphasised by strohmayer & brown ( 2002 ) , neutrino cooling is important for large carbon fractions : it depresses the flux at @xmath88@xmath89 hours for the models with @xmath90 and @xmath57 , @xmath91 in figure 2 .",
    "whenever neutrinos dominate the cooling , the peak temperature is large enough that emission is by pair annhilation .",
    "a good fit to the neutrino energy loss rate is @xmath92 , giving a cooling time @xmath93 .",
    "inserting the peak temperature from equation ( 2 ) gives @xmath94 .",
    "neutrinos dominate when @xmath95 , or when @xmath96 .",
    "the cooling curves in figure [ fig : gop3 ] compare well with observed lightcurves , including a rapid initial decay on hour timescales , followed by an extended tail of emission ( as observed following some superbursts , e.g.  ks  1731 - 260 , kuulkers et al .",
    "2002 ; ser x-1 , cornelisse et al .",
    "2002 ) . we will present a detailed comparison with the observed superburst lightcurves in a future paper .",
    "the initial decay from the peak depends mostly on @xmath46 , and so it should be possible to constrain the amount of fuel consumed in the superburst .",
    "our models do not resolve the peak itself , since this depends on the details of how the burning propagates out to the surface ; however , for @xmath97@xmath57 , the flux exceeds the eddington flux , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the h fraction , for timescales of minutes . superburst peak luminosities are generally less than the eddington luminosity ( kuulkers 2003 ) , implying @xmath100 .",
    "the one exception is the superburst from 4u  1820 - 30 , which showed dramatic photospheric radius expansion lasting for several minutes ( strohmayer & brown 2002 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the proposal that this source , which accretes and burns he rich material , produces large quantities of carbon ( strohmayer & brown 2002 ; cumming 2003a ) .",
    "the transition to the late - time power law occurs after @xmath101 ( eq .  [ 5 ] ) , which corresponds to @xmath102 . it may therefore be possible to measure the power law decay using superburst tails , although this depends upon being able to subtract out the underlying accretion luminosity , @xmath103 , in a reliable way .",
    "another way to probe the late - time cooling is to use the remarkable observation that type i bursts disappear ( are `` quenched '' ) for @xmath104 weeks following the superburst ( e.g.  kuulkers 2003 ) .",
    "cb01 proposed that the cooling flux from the superburst temporarily stabilizes the h / he burning .",
    "an estimate of the critical stabilizing flux , @xmath105 , is as follows .",
    "the condition for temperature fluctuations to grow , and unstable he ignition to occur , is @xmath106 ( fushiki & lamb 1987 ) , where @xmath107 is the triple alpha ( @xmath108 ) energy production rate , @xmath109 is a local approximation to the cooling rate , and @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the respective temperature sensitivities . for a large flux from below ,",
    "the he burns stably before reaching this ignition condition , at a depth where the time to accumulate the layer equals the he burning time , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the he mass fraction , @xmath114 is the local accretion rate per unit area , and @xmath115 mev per nucleon is the @xmath108 energy release . at the transition from unstable to stable burning ,",
    "both criteria are satisfied at the base of the h / he layer .",
    "using the first condition to eliminate @xmath107 from the second , and writing @xmath116 , gives @xmath117 .",
    "some of this flux is provided by hot cno burning of accreted h , @xmath118 ( cumming & bildsten 2000 ; @xmath119 is the metallicity ) ; the remainder is @xmath120 .",
    "this estimate agrees well with a more detailed calculation using the ignition models of cumming & bildsten ( 2000 ) , in which we find @xmath121 per accreted nucleon , almost independent of @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , @xmath123 ( see also paczynski 1983a ; bildsten 1995 ) .",
    "equation ( 5 ) in the limit @xmath124 gives @xmath125 which gives @xmath126 in terms of the thickness of the layer and energy release .",
    "figure 5 compares the predicted and observed quenching times .",
    "the observations of @xmath127 and accretion rates ( used to find @xmath105 from eq .",
    "[ [ eq : fcrit ] ] ) are taken from kuulkers ( 2003 ) ( except for 4u  1636 - 53 , which has a revised upper limit of @xmath128 days , kuulkers private communication ) .",
    "the observations are upper or lower limits only : nonetheless , the general agreement is very good and supports the quenching picture suggested by cb01 .",
    "there is much to learn from a careful comparison of superburst lightcurves and the corresponding quenching times , separately constraining both @xmath46 and @xmath48 .",
    "we have presented the first multi - zone models of the cooling phase of superbursts . the flux decay is not exponential , but power - law ( eq .  [ 5 ] ) . for @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the cooling time at the base of the layer",
    ", the flux depends mostly on the energy release @xmath46 , and is insensitive to depth : the inwards travelling cooling wave does not yet know that the layer has a finite thickness . for @xmath131 ,",
    "the flux decays as a power law @xmath3 , independent of the initial temperature profile .",
    "the power law decay at late times gives predicted type i burst quenching times of weeks ( eq .  [ 6 ] ) , consistent with observational limits .",
    "future comparisons of both superburst lightcurves and quenching times with observations will constrain both the thickness of the fuel layer and the energy deposited , particularly when combined with models of normal type i bursts from the same source ( cumming 2003a , b ) .",
    "there is still much to be done in terms of theory .",
    "perhaps the most important issues are the physics of the rise ( which sets the initial condition for our simulations ) , and production of the fuel .",
    "important clues to the first are the observed precursors to superbursts , which may be normal type i bursts ignited by the superburst .",
    "recent progress has been made on the second , with indications from both theory ( schatz et al .",
    "2003 ; woosley et al .",
    "2003 ) and observations ( in  t zand et al .  2003 ) that stable burning may be required to produce enough carbon to power superbursts . a self - consistent model of h",
    "/ he burning , followed by accumulation and ignition of the ashes may require a better understanding of the transition from unstable to stable burning observed in normal type i bursting ( e.g.  cornelisse et al .  2003 ) .",
