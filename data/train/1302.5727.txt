    "in the subject of planar harmonic mappings , the mappings which arise as poisson integrals of step functions , especially those which are univalent , play a prominent role ( cf . ) . when the mapping is univalent , the image is a domain bounded by a jordan polygon with its vertices at the steps of the boundary function .",
    "mappings of this type also appear when conformally parametrizing minimal graphs known as jenkins - serrin surfaces @xcite .",
    "these are minimal graphs which take values @xmath0 over the sides of a domain bounded by a jordan polygon , and if the parameter space is taken to be the unit disk @xmath1 , then the first two coordinate functions of the parametrization give a univalent harmonic mapping which is given by the poisson integral of a step function @xcite .    in 1989 ,",
    "t. sheil - small @xcite made a study of the mapping properties of poisson integrals of step functions and posed the following problem .",
    "* the mapping problem*. _ given a domain @xmath2 bounded by a jordan polygon , does there exist a univalent harmonic mapping @xmath3 , which is the poisson integral of a step function , such that @xmath4 ? _    there is a classical univalence criterion for harmonic mappings of @xmath1 onto a convex domain .",
    "the problem stated by t. rad in 1926 @xcite and solved by h. kneser @xcite the same year , shows that for any homeomorphism of the unit circle @xmath5 onto the boundary @xmath6 of a convex domain @xmath2 , the harmonic extension maps @xmath1 univalently onto @xmath2 .",
    "later g. choquet @xcite gave another proof which allowed the boundary function to be constant on arcs , and even to have jump discontinuities .",
    "thus , by choquet s theorem , the mapping problem has a positive solution when the polygon is convex .",
    "this mapping problem has also been repeated in the book @xcite and more recently in the book @xcite ) .",
    "also it was conjectured in @xcite that there would be polygons for which there is no such mapping .",
    "in this paper we shall describe an algorithm which leads to a positive solution to the mapping problem .",
    "[ thm : main ] given any jordan polygon @xmath7 bounding a domain @xmath2 , there exists a step function @xmath8 on @xmath5 whose harmonic extension gives a univalent harmonic mapping of @xmath1 onto @xmath2 .    in order to state the problem precisely , consider the polygon @xmath9 $ ] as a positively oriented jordan curve with distinct vertices @xmath10 bounding a domain @xmath2 . for a sequence of intervals",
    "@xmath11 , consider the poisson integral @xmath12 of the ( complex ) step function ( also denoted by @xmath3 ) @xmath13 the problem then comes down to showing that there is a choice of @xmath14 for which the poisson extension is univalent .",
    "we prove this theorem in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we describe an estimate for harmonic measure in a half - plane which can be useful in determining the univalence across the sides of a polygon as it arises as the image of the poisson integral of a step function .",
    "we follow the notation in @xcite .",
    "with @xmath15 represented by analytic functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , it is enough to show , by theorem 5 in @xcite , that the zeros of @xmath18 are outside @xmath1 the unit disk , where @xmath19 for @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for @xmath23 .",
    "we give a proof by induction on the number of vertices .",
    "* induction statement : * given any jordan @xmath24-gon , there exists a sequence of intervals such that the zeros of @xmath25 are in @xmath26 .",
    "the `` base case '' @xmath27 is a triangle and the statement follows from the rado - kneser - choquet theorem .",
    "inductive step : suppose the induction statement is true up to some @xmath24 . consider a jordan @xmath28-gon , @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "we follow the triangulation algorithm known as `` ear clipping '' . namely , find a vertex of @xmath7 , without loss of generality assume the vertex is @xmath30 , such that removing it results in a jordan polygon with @xmath24 vertices .",
    "such a vertex is called an `` ear '' in computational geometry , and it is well - known that every jordan polygon has at least two ears @xcite .",
    "* lemma a.*(the `` two ears '' theorem ) _ any jordan polygon has at least two `` ears '' .",
    "_    consider the @xmath24-gon @xmath31 $ ] . by the induction statement",
    ", there is a choice of intervals @xmath32 so that the poisson integral of the corresponding step function @xmath12 is univalent , and the zeros of @xmath25 are outside the closed unit disk @xmath33 .",
    "we construct a map @xmath34 to @xmath7 by making a new choice of intervals @xmath35 namely , we take @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath34 is taken to be the poisson integral of the step function @xmath39 in comparison with the choice of intervals used for the map @xmath12 , this slightly alters the interval corresponding to @xmath40 and introduces a new interval @xmath41 of size @xmath42 corresponding to the ear @xmath30 ( see figure [ fig : ear ]     in the vicinity of the ear @xmath30 . ]    with these choices and using the notation @xmath43 for @xmath23 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the analytic part of @xmath49 .",
    "* claim 1 : * as @xmath50 , @xmath51 approximates @xmath52 uniformly outside any neighborhood of the point @xmath53 .    to verify claim 1 , we note that the first @xmath54 terms in the sum ( [ eq : heps ] ) are the same as the first @xmath54 terms in @xmath55 thus , in order to prove claim 1 we only need to check that as @xmath50 the last two terms in @xmath56 @xmath57 converge uniformly to the last term in @xmath52 @xmath58 which follows from @xmath59    by claim 1 and hurwitz s theorem , @xmath51 has a zero near each of the zeros of @xmath52 . for @xmath60 sufficiently small , this places at least @xmath61 ( counting multiplicities ) of the @xmath54 zeros of @xmath51 outside @xmath33 ( not counting @xmath62 which is a zero of multiplicity two ) .",
    "it remains to show that the final zero of @xmath63 is also outside @xmath33 .",
    "estimating the location of this zero is slightly complicated by the fact that it converges to @xmath64 , the point where two poles are merging as @xmath50 .",
    "thus , we use a renormalization .",
    "let us write @xmath65 , and @xmath66 by the above , @xmath67 has @xmath61 zeros ( counting multiplicities ) converging to @xmath62 as @xmath50 .",
    "the remaining zero converges to a finite point @xmath68 in the right half - plane as follows from the next claim .",
    "* claim 2 : * @xmath67 has a zero at @xmath69 such that @xmath70    before proving claim 2 let us see how it establishes the result .",
    "it follows from the fact that @xmath71 $ ] is an _ outside _ corner that the argument of @xmath72 is strictly between zero and @xmath73 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 is in the right half - plane , and , for @xmath42 sufficiently small , @xmath75 is also in the right half - plane .",
    "this places @xmath76 ( the remaining zero of @xmath51 ) outside of @xmath33 , and this completes the inductive step .",
    "it remains to prove claim 2 .",
    "we have @xmath77 choose a disk @xmath78 centered at the point @xmath79 such that @xmath80 omits each of the points @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "as @xmath50 , the first @xmath54 terms in ( [ eq : epsh1 ] ) converge uniformly to zero in @xmath78 while the final terms @xmath83 converge uniformly to @xmath84 where we have used @xmath85 this last expression ( [ eq : limit ] ) has a single zero in @xmath78 , namely at @xmath86 by hurwitz s theorem ( [ eq : epsh1 ] ) has exactly one zero in @xmath78 , and this zero converges to @xmath87 .",
    "in this section , we replace the unit disk with the upper half - plane @xmath88 , and consider the harmonic measure @xmath89 in @xmath88 of an interval @xmath90 on the real axis .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath91 as @xmath92 approaches a point on the real axis can be used to detect possible folding near an edge of the image polygon @xmath7 .",
    "lemma [ los ] below was an initial guide for theorem [ thm : main ] , although in the end we did not need it .",
    "however , it seems that it may be of independent interest .",
    "suppose @xmath95 are points on the real axis and the intervals @xmath96 $ ] and @xmath97 $ ] have length @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "suppose @xmath92 approaches @xmath100 along a segment .",
    "let @xmath101 be the imaginary part of @xmath94 , and let @xmath102 denote the harmonic measure of @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "then , @xmath103 in particular , this limit is independent of the angle of approach of @xmath104 .              in order to see how this can be useful ,",
    "suppose that @xmath118 $ ] is a jordan polygon and @xmath3 is the harmonic extension of the corresponding step function as before , but now composed with a mbius transformation so it is defined in @xmath88 .",
    "then , corresponding to ( [ f(x)1 ] ) we have points @xmath119 on the real axis , @xmath120      let @xmath124 be the harmonic measure of the interval @xmath125 $ ] with respect to @xmath94 .",
    "the map @xmath3 can be expressed simply as a linear combination of the vertices @xmath10 weighted by the harmonic measure @xmath124 of the interval that is mapped to @xmath10 : @xmath126    as noted in the introduction , if the map @xmath3 fails to be univalent , then there must be folding over the boundary , so it is natural to consider the local behavior of @xmath3 near an edge .",

    "namely , when @xmath132 , @xmath133 we obtain a similar expression for @xmath124 when @xmath134 , and when @xmath135 ( corresponding to the infinite interval ) we have @xmath136    guided by these approximations , one may quantify in terms of the relative lengths of the intervals , the contributions of the individual terms in ( [ f(x ) ] ) .",
