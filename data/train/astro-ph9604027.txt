    "the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) is a long term project with the main goal of searching for dark matter in our galaxy by identifying microlensing events toward the galactic bulge ( udalski et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ) . at times",
    "the bulge is unobservable we conduct other long - term photometric programs .",
    "a complete list of side - projects attempted by the ogle team can be found in paczyski et al .",
    "in particular , during last three observing seasons we monitored globular clusters ngc  104 ( = 47  tuc ) and ngc  5139 ( = @xmath0  cen ) in a search for variable stars of various types . of primary interest was detection of detached eclipsing binaries . in paper",
    "i ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1996 ) we presented results for three fields in @xmath0  cen . here",
    "we report on variables discovered in another three fields of that cluster .",
    "the ogle project is conducted using the 1-m swope telescope at las campanas observatory which is operated by carnegie institution of washington . a single @xmath5 pixels loral ccd chip , giving the scale of 0.435 arcsec / pixel is used as the detector .",
    "the initial processing of the raw frames is done automatically in near - real time .",
    "details of the standard ogle processing techniques are described by udalski et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "this paper is based mostly on the data obtained during 1996 observing season .",
    "the cluster was monitored for a period spanning about 3 months .",
    "detailed logs of observations can be found in udalski et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "we monitored three fields .",
    "fields 5139d and 5139e were centered about 13 arcmin west and about 13 arcmin east of the cluster center , respectively .",
    "field 5139f was centered about 12 arcmin south in respect to field 5139e .",

    "most of observations in the v - band were collected with an exposure time set to 420 seconds . for the i - band exposures lasted 300 seconds .",

    "the total number of stars contained in data bases with v photometry was 37771 , 49426 and 22115 for fields , 5139d , 5139e and 5139f , respectively .",
    "most of these stars were faint objects with relatively large errors of photometry .",
    "table 3 gives condensed information about the numbers of stars analyzed for variability and about the quality of derived photometry .",
    "in this paper we present results for all variables identified in observed fields with the exception of rr lyr stars .",
    "rr lyr stars in @xmath2  cen shall be subject of a separate contribution .",
    "we identified a total of 32 periodic variables of which 28 are new discoveries .",
    "the rectangular and equatorial coordinates of these stars are listed in table 4 .",
    "the rectangular coordinates correspond to positions of variables on the v - band `` template '' images which were submitted to the editors of a&a ( see appendix a ) . these images allow easy identification of all objects listed in table 4 .",
    "the name of field in which a given variable can be identified is given in the 6th column .",
    "all frames collected by the ogle team were deposited at the nasa nss data center .",
    "frames mr10525 , mr10524 and mr11042 were used as templates for fields 5139d , 5139e and 5139f , respectively . the transformation from rectangular to equatorial coordinates was derived based on positions of stars which could be matched with objects from the guide star catalogue ( lasker et al .",
    "we identified 77 , 106 and 82 gsc stars for fields 5139d , 5139e and 5139f , respectively .",
    "the adopted frame solutions reproduce equatorial coordinates of gsc stars with residuals rarely exceeding 0.5 arcsec .",
    "our sample of variables consist of 10 sx  phe stars and 19 certain or probable eclipsing binaries .",
    "objects oglegc17 and oglegc20 were already reported in paper i. these two stars are located in the overlapping areas of fields 5139a / e and 5139c / f .",
    "they were `` re - discovered '' in the photometry analyzed here .",
    "variables oglegc42=e39 and oglegc50=njl220 were known before our survey ( jorgensen & hansen 1984 ) .",
    "table 5 lists basic characteristics of the light curves of 10 sx  phe stars identified in fields 5139d - f .",
    "the mean v magnitudes were calculated by numerically integrating the phased light curves after converting them into intensity scale .",
    "photometric data for the remaining variables are given in table 6 .",
    "to determine the most probable periods we used an _ aov _ statistic ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1989 , 1991 ) .",
    "this statistic allows  in particular  reliable determination of periods for variables with non - sinusoidal light curves ( eg . eclipsing variables of ea - type )",
    ". phased light curves of sx  phe stars are shown in fig . 1 while figs . 2 and 3 present light curves for the remaining variables .",
    "figure 4 shows location of variables with known color on the cluster color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) . for the sx",
    "phe stars marked positions correspond to the intensity - averaged magnitudes . for the remaining variables we marked positions corresponding to magnitude at maximum light .",
    "the main sequence and red giant branch are marked with double lines in fig .",
    "the large width of these sequences is due to the well known spread of metallicity exhibited by stars in @xmath2  cen ( woolley 1966 ) .",
    "all sx  phe stars as well as some eclipsing binaries are located on the cluster cmd among candidate blue stragglers .",
    "four eclipsing binaries occupy positions at the base of the subgiant branch . among them",
    "there are two systems with ea - type light curves : oglegc17 and oglegc51 .",
    "the first system has been already reported in paper i. the second one is a new discovery .",
    "the orbital period of oglegc51 , @xmath1 day , connected with the shape of its light curve indicate that this binary is a detached system .",
    "the phase coverage at the primary minimum is poor and observed depth of the primary eclipse should be treated as a lower limit only .",
    "the variable was caught twice in the primary eclipse and twice in the secondary eclipse .",
    "this allowed to determine the period of oglegc51 with confidence .",
    "five variables occupy positions on the upper part of the main - sequence of the cluster .",
    "oglegc53 exhibit eb - type light curve and has period close to 0.50 day",
    ". it may be either a semidetached or nearly contact binary .",
    "oglegc49 , oglegc54 and oglegc56 show light curves and periods typical for w uma - type contact binaries .",
    "oglegc43 also shows ew - type light curve but at the same time its period , @xmath8 day , is unexpectedly long for a contact binary of late spectral type .",
    "the light curve of this star shows two distinct minima .",
    "hence , we can rule out a possibility that oglegc43 is a pulsating variable with @xmath9 day located in the galactic halo behind the cluster .",
    "another interesting binary identified in our survey is oglegc52 .",
    "this star is located slightly above the horizontal branch of the cluster near the blue edge of the instability strip .",
    "its light curve suggest a semi - detached configuration with a red component filling its roche lobe . the secondary eclipse is shallow but",
    "the depth of the primary eclipse indicates comparable sizes of components of the system .",
    "most probably oglegc52 is composed of a horizontal branch star and a red sub - giant .",
    "the out - of - eclipse part of the light curve does not show presence of any secondary periodicity .",
    "hence , the blue component of oglegc52 is not a rr  lyr star . some scatter visible in the light curve before primary eclipse is due to problems with photometring over - exposed images of the star .",
    "we consider some of our period determinations , especially those for oglegc61 and oglegc65 , as preliminary . for oglegc61 we obtained reasonable , low - amplitude light curves for two values of the orbital period : 0.631 and 0.479 day . for oglegc65",
    "the possible periods are 0.512 and 0.408 day .",
    "the periods of all identified sx  phe stars are rather firmly established . for variables of this type",
    "we calculated the power spectra using the program based on a clean algorithm ( roberts et al .",
    "for all stars the derived power spectra show a very prominent peak at positions corresponding to the periods listed in table 5 .",
    "the variable oglegc41 is located about 0.3 mag to the red of the subgiant branch of the cluster .",
    "we adopted for this star a period @xmath10 day but it can not be ruled out that the real period is twice shorter . for @xmath10 day",
    "the likely reason of observed variability would be binary nature of oglegc41 .",
    "this star could be either an eclipsing binary or an ellipsoidal variable .",
    "for @xmath11 day it could belong to by  dra or fk  com type variables .",
    "the relatively red color of oglegc41 is consistent with the hypothesis that it belongs to spotted variables .",
    "the contact binary oglegc67 is located more than 0.5 mag to the red of the base of the subgiant branch on the cluster cmd .",
    "it is most probably a foreground star .",
    "the low amplitude variable oglegc68 is located about 2 mag above cluster turnoff and 0.3 mag to the blue of the subgiant branch .",
    "we adopted for it a period of 0.65 day but the light curve can be phased also with a period of 1.3 day .",
    "for @xmath12 day the star could be a foreground spotted variable . for @xmath13 day it could be an ellipsoidal variable composed of subgiant and a star from an extended horizontal branch .",
    "the @xmath2  cen cluster is located at an intermediate galactic latitude of @xmath14  deg .",
    "therefore , one can not assume that all variables listed in table 4 are cluster members .",
    "figure 5 shows the period versus absolute magnitude diagram for 10 sx  phe stars listed in table 5 .",
    "the standard relations for the f - mode pulsators ( solid line ) and the h - mode pulsators ( dashed line ) and for @xmath15=-2.2}$ ] ( upper line ) and @xmath16=-0.7}$ ] ( lower line ) are also shown .",
    "the calibration @xmath17 $ ] was taken from nemec et al .",
    "we adopted for the cluster an apparent distance modulus @xmath18 while calculating absolute magnitudes of sx  phe stars .",
    "the assumed range of metallicities is based on results published by brown and wallerstein ( 1993 ) and vanture et al .",
    "the observed luminosities of reported sx  phe stars are consistent with the hypothesis that all of them are members of the cluster .",
    "we have applied the absolute brightness calibration established by rucinski ( 1995 ) to calculate @xmath19 for newly discovered contact binaries .",
    "rucinski s calibration gives @xmath19 as a function of period , unreddened color @xmath20 and metallicity : @xmath21.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we adopted for all systems @xmath22=-1.6 $ ] what is the mean metallicity for the cluster stars .",
    "figure 6 shows the period versus an apparent distance modulus diagram for contact binaries identified in fields 5139d - f . of @xmath2  cen .",
    "specifically the following systems listed in table  6 were considered to be `` normal '' w  uma - type binaries : oglegc20 , 44 , 48 , 49 , 54 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 61 , 64 , 65 and 67 .",
    "an apparent distance modulus was calculated for each system as a difference between its v magnitude and @xmath23 .",
    "an apparent distance modulus for @xmath2  cen is estimated at @xmath18 ( nemec et al .",
    "the systems with mostly deviating values of @xmath24 are oglegc48 , oglegc57 and oglegc67 ( this system is not marked in fig .",
    "these binaries are probably a foreground variables .",
    "the remaining systems plotted in fig .",
    "6 are likely members of the cluster .",
    "clearly some additional data are needed to establish with more confidence which variables identified in our survey are members of @xmath2  cen .",
    "we note that potential field interlopers should exhibit radial velocity differing significantly from the velocity observed for the cluster .",
    "radial velocity of @xmath2 cen is + 228 km / sec ( eg .",
    "zinn 1985 )",
    "what is a much higher value than velocities observed for field stars from the cluster region .",
    "in fig . 7 we show the @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 cmds for fields 5139d - f . for each field",
    "the photometry is based on a single pair of `` long '' v&i exposures .",
    "the cmd s based on `` short '' exposures are presented in fig .",
    "the frames used for construction of cmd s shown if figs . 7 and 8 are listed in table 7 .",
    "the presented cmds were cleaned from stars of relatively poor photometry .",
    "the presented cmds show the same features which have been already noted in paper i. several likely hot subdwarfs with @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be noted .",
    "also a numerous candidates for blue stragglers are visible , especially in fields 5139d and 5139e .",
    "the apparent main sequence of field stars can be traced from the base of the subgiant branch of the cluster up to @xmath27 what is the bright limiting magnitude of our photometry .",
    "this sequence is probably related to the so called `` old disc '' discussed recently by jonch - sorensen & knude ( 1994 ) and ng et al .",
    "all photometry presented in this section was submitted in tabular form to the editors of a&a and is available in electronic form to all interested readers ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the potential users of this photometry should be aware about possibility of some systematic errors of the photometry .",
    "these errors are most likely to be significant for relatively faint stars .",
    "the ccd chip used for observations by the ogle suffers from some nonlinearity .",
    "more details on this subject can be found in paper i.",
    "the cmd s of all monitored fields contain sizeable population of candidates for blue stragglers .",
    "blue stragglers are known to be present in most well studied globular clusters ( eg .",
    "ferraro et al . 1995 ) .",
    "several lines of evidence indicate that blue stragglers have higher masses than turnoff stars in their parent clusters .",
    "this supports hypothesis , originally proposed by mccrea ( 1964 ) that they are formed by merging of close binaries .",
    "in fact a few dozen photometric binary blue stragglers . were discovered in globular clusters during recent years ( see mateo ( 1996 ) for a recent summary ) .",
    "these are mostly w uma - type contact systems but some detached and semi - detached systems are are also known .",
    "another type of variable blue stragglers occurring in globulars are sx  phe stars .",
    "the fraction of variables seems to vary significantly from cluster to cluster .",
    "for example about 30% of blue stragglers in ngc5053 are short - period variables ( nemec et al . 1995 ) while no single variable could be identified among 27 blue stragglers in ngc  6366 ( harris 1993 ) .",
    "it is not clear for the moment how the relative frequency of variable blue stragglers correlates with such parameters as age and metallicity of a host cluster .",
    "we used our data to estimate a relative frequency of contact binaries and sx  phe stars among @xmath2  cen blue stragglers .",
    "it has to be noted at this point that the definition of blue stragglers is somehow flexible .",
    "it is unclear how to separate regions occupied by the turnoff stars and faint blue stragglers . for fields 5139a , 5139bc , 5139c and 5139d",
    "the following limits are adopted to define area occupied by blue stragglers : @xmath28 , @xmath29 . for fields 5139e and 5139f",
    "the corresponding limits are : @xmath28 , @xmath30 .",
    "the different definition of the red edge of the blue stragglers area reflects differences in the turnoff color observed for monitored fields .",
    "these differences may be possibly caused by the patchy reddening across the cluster face .",
    "the data presented in fig . 7 and the data presented in fig . 12 from paper",
    "i were used to determine a number of blue stragglers in each of monitored fields .",
    "note that presented cmd s are highly incomplete as we plotted only stars with relatively reliable photometry .",
    "the degree of incompleteness varies with changing crowding .",
    "table 8 gives a number of selected blue stragglers candidates .",
    "only objects whose light curves were analyzed for variability were retained in this statistic .",
    "the number of variable blue stragglers which were included in presented cmd s is also given in table 8 .",
    "all counted objects are blue straggles according to adopted criteria on color and magnitude .",
    "note that some detected variable blue stragglers were dropped from the statistic .",
    "these were stars with formally poor photometry in the data sets used for plotting the cmd s .",
    "the fields 5139a and 5139c - f overlap with field 5139bc .",
    "moreover , field 5139f overlaps with fields 5130e and 5139c .",
    "the statistics given in table 8 applies to the non - overlapping parts of surveyed fields .",
    "the effective area of all fields are given in the second column of table 8 .",
    "we counted a total of 200 candidate blue stragglers .",
    "this number includes 24 sx  phe stars and 11 binaries ( 9 ew and 2 eb / ea systems ) .",
    "we showed that most of detected variables are very likely cluster members .",
    "the lower limits on the relative frequency of sx  phe stars and eclipsing binaries among cluster blue straggles are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "it is difficult to asses precisely what fraction of candidate blue stragglers are field interlopers .",
    "however , we note that the surface density of possible blue stragglers is by a factor of @xmath33 higher for the central field 5139bc than for the outermost field 5139f .",
    "it may be concluded that most of selected blue stragglers are indeed members of the cluster .",
    "our data indicate that @xmath2  cen contains the largest number of blue stragglers among all well studied galactic globular clusters ( eg .",
    "ferraro et al . 1995 ) .",
    "this section summarizes results presented above as well as those described in paper  i. we surveyed a total of six fields covering most of the central part of @xmath2  cen and identified 70 periodic variables .",
    "this sample includes 5 previously known variables .",
    "rr  lyr stars are excluded from these statistics  a separate paper devoted to them is in preparation .",
    "the most interesting result is identification of 3 detached eclipsing systems which are located at the base of the subgiant branch of the cluster .",
    "these are oglegc15 , oglegc17 and oglegc51 .",
    "further observations of these systems can lead to direct determination of masses and radii of turnoff stars in @xmath2  cen .",
    "an accurate determination of the cluster distance would be also obtained from such data .",
    "another clearly detached binaries discovered in our survey are oglegc14 and oglegc52 .",
    "the former one is a blue straggler ( assuming it is a cluster member ) while the latter is located slightly above the horizontal branch of the cluster . determination of parameters for components of oglegc52 would provide information about masses of horizontal branch stars in @xmath0  cen .",
    "we obtained light curves for 34 sx  phe stars .",
    "all of them are located among blue stragglers and are likely members of the cluster .",
    "20 out of 34 of identified sx  phe stars shows variability with a full range not exceeding 0.1 mag in the v - band . detected sx",
    "phe stars constitute about 11% of the blue straggler population of @xmath2  cen .",
    "several contact or nearly - contact binaries were identified .",
    "most of them are located among blue stragglers but some systems are present among upper main - sequence and turnoff stars .",
    "most of identified contact binaries are likely members of the cluster .",
    "three low - amplitude variables with periods from the range 19 - 33 days were identified on the subgiant branch ( oglegc22 , oglegc35 and oglegc69 ) .",
    "these stars belong most likely to the so called `` spotted '' variables .",
    "another likely variable of this type is oglegc30 whose position on the cmd is unknown due to lack of information about its color .",
