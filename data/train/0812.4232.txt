    "microquasars are stellar binaries in which one of the component is a black hole .",
    "the stellar companion is filling its roche lobe , ejecting matter through the first lagrangian point , which then organizes itself around the compact object as an accretion disk .",
    "the temperature of the disk increases strongly towards the center and large amounts of x - rays with powerful , persistent and collimated jets are produced . in some cases ,",
    "the relativistic jets appear to be superluminal .",
    "microquasars are galactic laboratories of high - energy phenomena , and they must be seen as part of a large paradigm where agns , microquasars and possibly gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) share similar physics @xcite .    there are various physical reasons why the distance is an important parameter in our understanding of microquasars .",
    "firstly , the superluminal velocity effect of the jets ( which is a relativistic time delay effect producing an apparent velocity on the sky larger than the speed of light ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) depends on the distance .",
    "although it is a pure geometrical effect , it has a minimum threshold of @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 the speed of light ) below which the jets are not superluminal , whatever their true spatial speed @xmath2 .",
    "when one tries to model the jets , and more importantly , the jet s launching mechanism , it is important to know the true velocity ( and hence power ) of the jets .",
    "moreover , this effect is not very common , and it will become more important to correctly identify superluminal objects when the statistics will grow with future x - ray missions .    secondly , the possible misalignment of the jets with respect to the accretion disk axis . as a matter of fact , gro  j165540  is often quoted as the typical microquasar where the jets and the disk are misaligned ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is directly related to the fact that the determination of the jet projection angle is linked to that of the distance , as explained below .",
    "the possible misalignment of the jet is an important clue of the formation and evolution of the system ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thirdly , the black holes origin , and their orbit in our galaxy .",
    "this is particularly true for gro  j165540 , where a change in the distance by a factor of three makes a large difference to the orbit of the object in the galaxy .",
    "see for instance @xcite who have calculated the orbit for gro  j165540  with @xmath3 and 3.2 kpc .",
    "this is important for our understanding of the origin of black holes in our galaxy , and their distribution throughout the disk .",
    "finally , the true luminosity of the stellar companion can also be an important point in our understanding of the microquasars as dynamical objects , and in particular how the companion is affected by the filling of its roche lobe and is certainly ( partially ) irradiated by x - rays from the accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the distance of microquasars is a simple yet central parameter in our description of these objects , conditioning a large part of our understanding both of the physics and the astronomical views of black hole stellar systems .",
    "the origin of this work is to be found in the publication by @xcite who note that the distance of gro  j165540  can be actually radically different from the accepted distance of 3.2  kpc determined by @xcite .",
    "this later value has since then been apparently confirmed by many other studies .",
    "in fact , gro  j165540  is a runaway black hole and mirabel et al .",
    "published its proper motion , obtained with the _ hubble space telescope_. the opposite direction of the proper motion points almost perfectly ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) to the center of a cluster ( ngc  6242 ) located at 1.0 kpc from the sun @xcite . it is then tempting to think that the system received a kick velocity at the moment of the primary s supernova explosion , and then moved away from its original cluster .",
    "this is the starting question : is the distance of gro  j165540  3.2 or 1.0 kpc ? among other things ,",
    "the jets are superluminal with @xmath4 kpc , but not at 1.0 kpc .",
    "@xcite published a new method providing only an upper limit to the distance and giving @xmath5 kpc when applied to gro  j165540 , thus challenging the accepted distance of 3.2  kpc .",
    "this method is also partially problematic , and it will be discussed critically below . with a maximum distance of 1.7  kpc , gro",
    "j165540  becomes a likely candidate of being the closest ( stellar ) black hole to the sun .",
    "the position is currently held by a062000 , which has an average measured distance of about 1.0 kpc .",
    "we will show however that the distance of a062000  is also very uncertain , revealing different problems in each distance method .    in summary ,",
    "none of the published distances of gro  j165540  and a062000  are so far reliable .",
    "this paper emphasizes the difficulties encountered when determining the distance of microquasars , and shows that the distances of probably many , if not all , microquasars in our galaxy are much more uncertain than currently admitted . in this paper",
    "we aim to provide a fair and critical review on the distance methods used on these two galactic microquasars .",
    "other microquasars will be the subject of a subsequent work .",
    "in addition to @xcite , partial material ( incomplete and partially incorrect on the radio - jet distance of gro  j165540 ) has already been published in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper addresses many more important details , and in particular the issues of the dynamical studies used to determine the absolute magnitude of the secondary star of gro  j165540 .",
    "moreover , we also provide a completely new estimate of the distance of gro  j165540 .",
    "finally , we apply the method of @xcite to a062000 , along with archival astrometric data .",
    "we conclude that gro  j165540  is certainly closer than the current accepted distance , but that a062000  might be even closer still .",
    "the distance of a _ stellar _ object is often measured by comparing its absolute and apparent magnitudes .",
    "there are other methods , such as astrometry and parallax , and jet speed measurements ( see below ) for the special case of microquasars .",
    "but most often , the core method is simply this one .",
    "it reads : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the true apparent magnitude of the object , affected only by the geometrical distance separating the object and the observer .",
    "there are ( at least ) two major issues with this method : one is general , and one is specific to stellar binaries of short period . the first _",
    "difficulty is that @xmath7 is usually different from the observed apparent magnitude @xmath8 since the light is going through some absorbing patchy interstellar medium , which makes the star dimmer and redder .",
    "we have : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the absorption , in the given passband , expressed in magnitudes . therefore : @xmath11 the determination of @xmath10 is critical .",
    "it is often not measured directly , but rather is the so - called color excess , or reddening : @xmath12 , which is the relative amount of additional red color between the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands due to the absorption of bluer wavelengths by the gas and the dust . for a star",
    ", the color excess can be obtained by comparing the observed and the intrinsic @xmath13 and @xmath14 color indices ( the latter being inferred from the spectral type ) : @xmath15 the absorption in the @xmath14 band follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total - to - selective absorption . for other colors , this relation needs corrections ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the practice shows that what is often measured directly is @xmath12 , @xmath17 being often approximated3.0 and 3.7 implies a relative distance uncertainty of 1.38 . ] by a value between 3.0 and 3.7 with a more - or - less canonical value of 3.1 .",
    "in fact , @xmath17 is a function of the interstellar reddening curve and the color of the stars , because the wide passbands of the photometric @xmath13 and @xmath14 filters makes the effective wavelengths of the filters shift with different stellar intensity gradients .",
    "@xcite gives an approximate relation for @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the unreddened color index of the star .",
    "this relation is valid for normal stars with @xmath20 and @xmath21 to within an error of 0.05 in @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "see for instance @xcite for a comparison for various photometric systems , and @xcite for an updated discussion on this topic .",
    "the other issue with the method consisting of comparing the magnitudes , specific to the stellar binaries with short period , is that the stellar companion ( here the secondary star ) is certainly not spherical anymore , since it completely fills its roche lobe to feed the accretion disk .",
    "moreover , its surface temperature might also not be homogeneous because of irradiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making its average observed temperature a function of the orbital phase .",
    "hence uncertainties arise when one tries to estimate the true value of the absolute magnitude , @xmath22 , in equation  [ equ_magdist ] , since it is often calibrated with `` normal '' ( spherical ) and isolated stars .",
    "the absolute magnitude is normally obtained through the determination of the spectral type of the star , which gives the temperature @xmath23 , and the modelling of either the radial - velocity curve or the multi - color lightcurves of the binary system gives the size of its orbit . from the latter",
    ", one can compute the _ effective _ roche - lobe radius ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is then identified to the radius of the star .",
    "assuming a uniform temperature distribution across the star and that it is roughly spherical , the luminosity ( and thus the absolute magnitude ) can be estimated with : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "gro  j165540  ( a.k.a .",
    "nova sco 94 ) has been discovered as a soft x - ray transient ( sxt ) on july 27 , 1994 with _",
    "batse _ on board the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ @xcite .",
    "its jets were observed in the radio , giving a distance of about 3 kpc , implying that they are superluminal : 1.5@xmath260.4  @xmath1 @xcite , 1.05  @xmath1 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the speed of light .",
    "gro  j165540  was the second superluminal source in our galaxy shortly after the discovery of the jets in grs  1915 + 105  by @xcite .",
    "the value of 3.2 kpc has been published by @xcite based on vla and vlba radio data .",
    "since then , many publications use directly this canonical distance .",
    "for instance : @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite use gro  j165540  and its parameters as a reference object for determining the mass of cyg  x-1 .",
    "but a significant number of studies seem to confirm the canonical distance .",
    "we challenge here not only the lower limit of 3.0  kpc of gro  j165540  but also every published confirmation .",
    "we note however that @xcite use with caution the upper limit of 1.7  kpc determined in @xcite .",
    "@xcite present new radio data from which they infer a value for the distance of gro  j165540 .",
    "the method is simple : the opposite motions of the receding and approaching jets ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively ) are directly related to jet projection angle relative to the line of sight @xmath29 , the true jet speed @xmath30 , and the distance @xmath31 .",
    "the authors measure the intrinsic proper motions of each jet : 54 mas  d@xmath32 for the ne component , and 45 mas  d@xmath32 for the sw component , and use the kinematic equation described in @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath1 is the speed of light .",
    "there are two equations and three unknowns .",
    "a constraint on the distance can be obtained by eliminating @xmath29 and requiring that @xmath34 : @xmath35 taking @xmath36 , the maximum distance of gro  j165540  inferred from the proper motion of the radio jets is @xmath37 kpc .",
    "a constraint on the inclination angle of the jets can also be obtained by eliminating @xmath38 and requesting that @xmath39 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath40 this gives : @xmath41 .",
    "rearranging equation  [ mumu1 ] and eliminating @xmath42 , we can write , using the value of @xmath29 : @xmath43 that is @xmath44 49.3 mas  d@xmath32 .",
    "all these results are given in @xcite .",
    "at this point the authors mention that : `` _ for a distance of 3.2  kpc , this corresponds to @xmath45 , implying @xmath46 .",
    "_ '' why 3.2 kpc ?",
    "the only previous mention of the distance at the beginning of the article is only stating that the source lies `` at a distance of about 3 kpc '' , and for which three references were given ( all discussed below ) : @xcite .",
    "in fact , the value @xmath47 kpc is constrained to lie between the value of 3.0 kpc considered as a lower limit and determined elsewhere , and the actual result on the upper limit of 3.5 kpc . however , choosing 3.2  kpc fixes @xmath29 that is now constrained to a very narrow range ( @xmath48 ) , and the system is now defined .",
    "furthermore , this value of 3.2 kpc is being confirmed by a model of the possible jet precession ( adding two parameters to the kinematic model : the precession period and axis inclination ) .",
    "it is however barely relevant concerning the distance , since , as mentioned earlier , the systems characteristics are now fixed .",
    "this additional modelling gives @xmath49 based on the fact that the jet precesses , or more precisely : `` [ ... ] the jets ` wiggle ' slightly about the best - fit position angle '' .",
    "the authors performed a detailed modelling , similar to what has been done by one of the authors on the galactic source ss433 which shows clearly jet precession @xcite .",
    "the model of the wiggles assume , of course , that they are true , and are due to the kinematics only . in fig .  3",
    "of @xcite we see the variations of position of roughly 4 different ejectas ( following the main solid lines only ) .",
    "it is obvious that few points perfectly follow the best - fit constant proper motion .",
    "but it is not obvious at all that they form a regular periodic pattern .",
    "succeeding at modelling these wiggles does not mean we can interpret them as the signature of jet precession taking place in gro  j165540 , since the low number of points makes the fit poorly constrained .",
    "at that point , it should be clear enough that these supposed wiggles do not help to secure the distance .",
    "but there are additional problems attached to them .    in order to interpret wiggles as precession",
    ", one must ensure that the global motion follow lines of constant proper motion .",
    "but the 22 epochs of _ vla _ observations used for by this model did not resolve the source at a level of 100 mas , but only as a multi - core object elongating with time .",
    "the reason why a constant proper motion is a reasonable hypothesis is because it is consistent with what is seen in the _ vlba _ observations .",
    "but the authors emphasize the lack of a very - long - baseline interferometry calibrator , which implies that these _ vlba _ data are self - calibrated , `` eliminating all absolute positional information , and leaving the alignment of the different images a free parameter . ''",
    "consequently , the fact that the brightest point in each image is the stationary center of ejection is an hypothesis .",
    "moreover , as mentioned in the paper , `` these [ vla ] and other [ unspecified ] data are consistent with constant intrinsic proper motion of 54 mas  d@xmath32 '' and later `` the underlying proper motions appear constant '' .",
    "this value is in agreement with the result of equation  [ mumu4 ] .",
    "the hypothesis of constant proper motion is strengthened by the fact that the daily southern hemisphere vlbi experiment ( sheve ) array observations of @xcite are consistent with the major structures of the _ vlba _ images of hjellming & rupen .",
    "as a matter of fact , the authors note that the proper motion inferred from sheve data of 65@xmath265 mas  d@xmath32 actually agrees with the 62 mas  d@xmath32 motion of the _ outer edge _ of the early ne ejecta .",
    "all these measurements indeed appear to roughly agree , but the uncertainties are likely large enough to encompass the wiggles . in summary , not only are the mere existence of these wiggles doubtful , but the simple ability to extract meaningful and additional constraints from it is also questionable .",
    "we conclude that the value of 3.2 kpc has been chosen between a firm upper limit of @xmath50  kpc and the external indication that its lower limit must be `` about 3 kpc '' , which consequently fix the value of @xmath29 .",
    "a questionable model is used to strengthen its value , and , as an obvious consequence , confirm the distance value .",
    "literally , later in the text , it is said that the `` [ ... ] kinematic model for gro  j165540  _ gives _ a distance of 3.2@xmath260.2 kpc '' .",
    "as noted above , three references are given for a first estimation of the distance : @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the first reference is literally citing the two others for the distance value , and must therefore be discarded .",
    "the paper by @xcite is actually an iau circular which simply states that `` hi observations of gro  j165540  made with the _ at compact array _",
    "show solid absorption in the velocity range @xmath51 to @xmath52  km  s@xmath32 , with a further isolated weak feature at @xmath53  km  s@xmath32 . _",
    "the balance of probabilities is that the distance is around 3.5 kpc , unless the @xmath53  km  s@xmath32  feature is due to an atypical cloud . _ ''",
    "although not being a robust measurement , the result obtained in this circular needs to be verified .",
    "identifying the origin of the negative - velocity features in the absorption spectrum is the crucial point , since it provides an estimate of the lower limit of the distance , if correctly interpreted ( i.e. if correctly identified and attributed to a component whose velocity can be estimated ) . to interpret the radio spectrum",
    ", one must consider a background source of unknown distance emitting continuum radiation ( here gro  j165540 ) that is being intercepted by foreground hi clouds .",
    "when one looks inside the solar galactic orbit , the line of sight goes through the multiple galactic spiral arms . assuming all the clouds are moving with the mean galactic rotation scheme , the more distant from the sun the cloud is , the more negative is its velocity , in the local standard of rest , down to the tangential point where the distance / velocity relation flips back .",
    "@xcite presented new radio _ vlbi _ and _ atca _ data of gro  j165540 .",
    "it is the only true work studying the lower distance limit of gro  j165540 .",
    "firstly , we note that a rather large distance is expected by the authors in order to agree with : `` a significant reddening due to absorption '' , as explained in @xcite .",
    "@xcite is a iau circular stating nothing more than : `` [ ... ] the [ optical ] spectrum exhibits prominent , broad balmer lines [ ... ] superimposed on a relatively red continuum . [ ... ] '' however , the spectrum has been taken during a flaring state .",
    "the spectral type of the secondary , and its possible veiling by the accretion disk , were , at that time , unknown . leaving this aside ,",
    "let us concentrate on the radio spectrum .",
    "the hi spectrum of tingay and collaborators , obtained with _ atca _ ( see their fig .  2 ) , shows a multi - component profile , with strong features at @xmath54  km  s@xmath32 , between @xmath55 and @xmath56  km  s@xmath32 , and isolated weak features at @xmath52 and @xmath53  km  s@xmath32  ( @xmath5718% and @xmath572% of the normalized continuum flux respectively ) .",
    "it is said that the latter feature is confirmed with multiple observations but no references are given .",
    "according to @xcite , the feature at @xmath53  km  s@xmath32  would imply a lower limit of @xmath574.2 kpc if it was participating to the mean galactic rotation .",
    "this feature is actually discarded by tingay and collaborators because it can not be ruled out that such feature is driven by an expanding shell surrounding the scorpius ob1 association located at 1.9 kpc from the sun ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_mapscoob1 ] ) .",
    "this is however the feature used by @xcite to derive an approximate distance of 3.5  kpc .",
    "in other words , @xcite derive @xmath58  kpc thanks to the feature at @xmath53  km  s@xmath32  that is discarded by @xcite because it would imply @xmath59  kpc .    according to @xcite , the feature at @xmath52  km  s@xmath32  implies a lower limit of 3.0  kpc if it is associated with the mean galactic rotation . to strengthen their conclusion",

    "ctb  35  a ) studied by @xcite and located 2.4  kpc away .",
    "in fact , the lower limit of the distance of gro  j165540  is built on this hypothesis : the feature at @xmath52  km  s@xmath32  in the radio spectrum is moving with the mean galactic rotation scheme , which is confirmed by the comparison with grs 345.4 + 1.4 .",
    "but if there is such uncertainty on the interpretation of the feature at @xmath53  km  s@xmath32 , why ca nt the feature at @xmath52  km  s@xmath32  not also be associated with sco  ob1 ? or could the latter be indeed associated with sco  ob1 while the most negative one is not ?",
    "the spectrum of grs  345.4 + 1.4 looks indeed similar to that of gro  j165540 , except that it has no absorption feature with velocities more negative than @xmath60  km  s@xmath32 .",

    "furthermore , @xcite have shown that there are a number of hi clouds in this region that have a peculiar velocity which can not be accounted for by assuming that such cloud is moving with the mean galactic rotation , since the derived distance from the hi absorption appears larger than that derived from optical observations of hii regions along the same line of sight .",
    "we are therefore entitled to conclude that no meaningful comparison can be made between two absorption radio spectra in this region of the sky and the interpretation of the negative velocity features in the absorption radio spectrum is uncertain .",

    "firstly , absorption lines comprised in the range @xmath63  km  s@xmath32  must arise from material between sco  ob1 and the observer , since it can not participate to the mean rotation curve .",
    "second , the absence of blueshifted absorption features with @xmath64  km  s@xmath32  in the spectrum of hd  152269 implies that the absorbing material responsible for these blue features is comprised between the star ( 720 pc away ) , and the cluster .",
