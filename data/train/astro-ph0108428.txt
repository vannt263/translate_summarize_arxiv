    "the region beyond neptune is populated by @xmath4 kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) with diameter @xmath5 km , with a total mass of @xmath6 earth masses ( jewitt , luu , & trujillo 1998 ) .",
    "these bodies are found in three dynamical classes : ( 1 ) the classical kbos , which have semimajor axes in the @xmath7 range with low eccentricities , @xmath8 ; ( 2 ) the resonant kbos , which occupy the mean - motion resonances with neptune , predominantly the plutinos ( @xmath9 au ) and the 2:1 objects ( @xmath10 au ) ; and ( 3 ) the scattered kbos , which are distant ( @xmath11 ) and have highly eccentric orbits ( @xmath12 ; jewitt & luu 2000 ) . to date , very little is known about the physical properties of these numerous kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) because most of the known objects are quite faint ; the known kbos have median red magnitude @xmath13 .",
    "studies of other outer solar system objects suggest that bright ( @xmath14 ) bodies are ideal targets for physical studies ( brown et al .",
    "1997 ; luu & jewitt 1998 ; brown , cruikshank & pendleton 1999 ; luu , jewitt & trujillo 2000 ; brown 2000 ) .",
    "they may also allow ( 1 ) albedo measurements through the use of combined thermal and visible measurements , as collected from centaur 10199 chariklo ( provisional designation 1997 @xmath15 ; jewitt & kalas 1998 ; altenhoff , menten & bertoldi 2001 ) and kbo 2000 @xmath16 ( jewitt & aussel 2001 ) ; and ( 2 ) direct imaging with the hubble space telescope , such as performed on pluto ( stern , buie & trafton 1997 ) and centaur 2060 chiron ( parker et al . 1997 ) .",
    "large kbos offer higher chances for occultations and longer duration events , such as have been observed for chiron ( elliot et al .",
    "1995 ; bus et al .",
    "1996 ) , charon ( walker 1980 ; elliot & young 1991 ) , and pluto ( elliot et al . 1989 ; millis et al . 1993 ) .",
    "very few surveys have been sensitive to these bright kbos , primarily due to the fact that the surface density of ecliptic kbos at @xmath17 is low , about 1 per 100 sq deg ( ferrin et al . 2001 ; larsen et al . 2001 ; and trujillo , jewitt & luu , 2001 ) . in the past",
    ", photographic plate surveys have been used to search for these objects .",
    "tombaugh ( 1961 ) examined about 20,000 sq deg in a decade - long survey to visual magnitude @xmath18 , and found only pluto in 1930 .",
    "kowal ( 1989 ) searched 6400 sq deg to visual magnitude @xmath19 and found one centaur , 2060 chiron , but no kbos .",
    "although plates easily image large areas , they suffer from poor sensitivity and surface defects .",
    "in addition , computer - assisted analysis of plates is more difficult than that of charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) .",
    "more recently , ccds , which have a much higher quantum efficiency than photographic plates , have played a growing role , due to technological advancements allowing increased detector size . for a review of",
    "all published wide - field ( @xmath20 sq deg ) ccd surveys , see table  [ surveys ] .    in this work",
    "we report results from a new survey of the outer solar system undertaken at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) using a large format mosaic ccd array ( muller et al .",
    "we have surveyed 164 square degrees to limiting red magnitude @xmath21 ( defined as the magnitude at which survey efficiency drops to 1/2 the maximum value ) .",
    "this survey yielded 3 bright kbos and 1 centaur , the brightest kbo being @xmath22 , corresponding to a diameter of 710 km , assuming a 4% red albedo .",
    "we use these data to constrain the number of large kbos and place limits on the maximum size of the kbos using a realistic model of the discovery process .",
    "observations were made with the now decommissioned kpno 0.9 m f/7.5 telescope and the 8192 x 8192 pixel mosaic ccd array .",
    "this array is composed of eight @xmath23 pixel ccds , each with an independent bias level and flat - field response .",
    "observations were made through a standard johnson @xmath24 filter to enhance the detection of the kbos , which have @xmath25 .",
    "the plate scale was 0.43 /pixel for the 15 @xmath26 m pixels , corresponding to a 0.96 sq deg field of view .",
    "this telescope and camera combination was unique in providing a nearly 1 sq deg field of view while simultaneously nyquist - sampling stellar images .",
    "in addition , the chips were relatively free from defects and had typical quantum efficiencies of @xmath27 in @xmath24 .",
    "telescope and detector parameters are listed in table  [ kpnoobs ] .",
    "fields were chosen to be within 1.5 hours of opposition where the parallactic motion of the kbos is greatest ( @xmath28 /hr ) , and easily distinguishable from the main - belt asteroid motion ( @xmath29 /hr ) .",
    "nearly all ( @xmath30 90% ) of the fields were confined to be within 5 deg of the ecliptic , as depicted in figures [ fields2 ] and [ fields1 ] .",
    "each field was imaged three times , using 200 s exposures with a @xmath31 hour separation between images .",
    "the observed fields included in the survey passed two quality tests : ( 1 ) they must have been taken during photometric conditions , and ( 2 ) they must have had a characteristic stellar full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) better than 2.5 . of the 285 fields imaged in the survey , only 171 passed these criteria .",
    "these fields are listed in table  [ kpnofieldtable ] . as detailed in table  [ kpnoobs ] , 1998 @xmath32",
    "was discovered by spacewatch three nights before we serendipitously detected the object .",
    "we verified that no known objects remained undiscovered in our data by computing the ephemerides of all bright ( @xmath33 ) objects with opposition motion slower than 10 arcsec / hr for the epochs observed .",
    "the width , ellipticity , and position angle of the point spread function ( psf ) varied significantly over the mosaic ccd field of view .",
    "we quantified this variation by fitting an elliptical moffat psf ( moffat 1969 ) to stars in the linear flux regime of the ccds for a large number of images .",
    "figure  [ psf ] shows the variations in the fwhm of the psf minor axis , as measured by iraf s imexam procedure .",
    "the ellipticity was found to be correlated with the minor axis fwhm , ranging in magnitude from 0.1  0.3 over the focal plane .",
    "the width , ellipticity and position angle information was used to add simulated kbos to the data in order to test our moving object detection software ( mods , trujillo & jewitt 1998 ) .",
    "the seeing in the survey varied from 0.9to 2.4 , with median 1.5 .",
    "we tested mods with 3 groups of images based on the seeing ( 0.9 1.4 , 1.4 1.9 , and 1.9 2.4 ; with median seeing 1.3 , 1.6 , and 2.1 , respectively ) .",
    "artificial moving objects , with profiles matched to the characteristic psf for each image group and location in the focal plane , were added to flattened images .",
    "a tally of objects was recorded , and the detection efficiency ( figure  [ kpnoefffig ] ) was computed and found to be uniform with respect to sky - plane speed in the 1.5  10 /hr range .    the psf- and seeing - corrected efficiency function was fitted with the same hyperbolic tangent function used in trujillo , jewitt & luu ( 2000 ) , given by @xmath34 the limiting red magnitude @xmath35 is the brightness where @xmath36 , with @xmath37 defined as the maximum detection efficiency obtained for bright objects .",
    "the characteristic magnitude range over which the efficiency drops from @xmath37 to zero is @xmath38 .",
    "the values of these parameters for each seeing range are listed in table  [ efftable ] .",
    "the poorer seeing images show a drop in @xmath35 compared to those with good seeing , consistent with reduced signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "thus , the limiting magnitude can be characterized as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 represents the fwhm of a stellar image in arc sec .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 varies little for the different seeing categories ; even for the worst seeing , @xmath37 is reduced by only 9% from the best seeing .",
    "the discovery circumstances for the 4 kpno objects appear in table  [ kpnodisc ] . although the discovered objects were found during good seeing ( table  [ kpnoobs ] ) , the null detection of objects in the medium and poor seeing cases is not statistically significant .",
    "given the @xmath41 slope of the cumulative luminosity function (   [ results ] ) and the limiting magnitude and sky area presented in table  [ efftable ] , 46% of the objects should be found during good seeing .",
    "thus , the probability of all 4 object detections occurring by chance during good seeing is @xmath42 ( less probable than a @xmath43 gaussian event ) .",
    "we therefore combine the data for all seeing cases into a single global efficiency function .",
    "the four critical quantities we estimate for the kbos are : ( 1 ) the cumulative luminosity function , or clf , ( 2 ) the size distribution and total number of objects , ( 3 ) the kbo maximum size , and ( 4 ) the total number and mass of large kbos ( @xmath44 km and @xmath45 km diameter ) .",
    "the cumulative luminosity function ( clf ) describes the surface density of kbos near the ecliptic ( @xmath46 ) versus limiting red survey magnitude ( @xmath47 ) and is fit by the equation @xmath48 where @xmath49 describes the slope and @xmath50 is the red magnitude at which @xmath51 kbo per sq deg . assuming heliocentric and geocentric distance and albedo independent of object size , and a differential size distribution @xmath52 , where @xmath53 describes the number of bodies with radii between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the size distribution of the kbos can be directly measured via ( irwin et al .",
    "1995 ) @xmath56    we estimated the clf by combining the discovery results of the 86 kbos found by trujillo , jewitt & luu ( 2001 , hereafter 01tjl ) with the three kbos found in our data .",
    "although the 01tjl data dominate the total numbers of faint objects , the two surveys have found comparable numbers of bright objects .",
    "in addition , our brightest object ( 1999 @xmath57 , @xmath22 ) was over a magnitude brighter than the brightest object from 01tjl ( 1999 @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "these two data sets improve upon previous survey results due to discovery statistics that cover nearly a 5 magnitude range ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "since the clf is a cumulative measure , the clf value at a given magnitude is correlated with the clf values at fainter magnitudes .",
    "thus , a linear fit to the clf will implicitly weight the bright bodies ( which are counted in the bright and faint data points ) to a greater degree than the faint bodies ( which are only counted in the faint data points ) .",
    "we instead perform a maximum - likelihood fit to find @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( gladman et al . 1998 ) , using the efficiency function ( equation  [ kpnoeff ] ) and the sky area imaged ( 164 sq deg ) .",
    "it was impossible for all fields to be centered on the ecliptic due to the large sky area imaged .",
    "thus , sky coverage was computed by weighting each field imaged by the fraction of kbos expected at that ecliptic latitude , assuming the best - fit inclination distribution of 01tjl , a half - width of 20 deg . for our kpno data ,",
    "this correction reduces our 164 sq deg to an effective area of 95.7 sq deg , resulting in a minor change ( 23% ) in the normalization of @xmath61 , a factor 2 smaller than the @xmath62 poisson uncertainty for @xmath61 due to the 4 kbos discovered ( 45% ) .",
    "the resulting best fit follows @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this result is in statistical agreement with many other previous works ( jewitt , luu & trujillo 1998 with @xmath65 , @xmath66 ; gladman et al .",
    "1998 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; chiang & brown 1999 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; and 01tjl @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) .",
    "we present this simple fit , our observations , and other works covering @xmath20 sq deg in figure  [ clf ] . using equation  [ qalpha ]",
    ", we find the exponent of the differential size distribution to be @xmath73 .",
    "we present a more detailed analysis in the next section , where we use a more realistic simulation to constrain the slope of the size distribution .      to better constrain the size distribution , we estimate @xmath74 and the total number of classical kbos larger than 100 km , @xmath75 , using a more realistic maximum - likelihood simulation than the clf fit described in the previous section .",
    "bias factors such as the detection efficiency and the distribution of discovery distances are correctly handled in this more detailed simulation .",
    "a full description of our simulation can be found in trujillo , jewitt & luu ( 2000 ) and 01tjl .",
    "we summarize the assumed quantities in table  [ model ] , and key procedures here :    \\(1 ) simulated orbital elements and object sizes were drawn for the classical kbos ( ckbos ) .",
    "\\(2 ) object brightnesses were computed from the following formula ( jewitt & luu 1995 ) : @xmath76 where @xmath77 represents the phase angle of the observations , @xmath78 is the bowell et al .",
    "( 1989 ) phase function for dark bodies ( @xmath79 ) , geometric albedo is given by @xmath80 , object radius is described by @xmath54 [ km ] , and @xmath24 [ au ] and @xmath81 [ au ] describe the heliocentric and geocentric distance of the body , respectively .",
    "the apparent red magnitude of the sun is @xmath82 .",
    "\\(3 ) object ecliptic coordinates and velocities were computed from the equations of sykes & moynihan ( 1996 , sign error corrected ) .",
    "\\(4 ) the observed field areas and efficiency functions were used to determine which of the simulated objects could be detected in either our survey or that of 01tjl , based on the ecliptic coordinates , velocities and brightnesses computed in steps 2 and 3 .",
    "\\(5 ) two tallies of the radii of the `` detected '' simulated objects were kept , one for our kpno 8k mosaic survey and one for the 01tjl survey .",
    "steps 1 - 4 were repeated until there were a factor 10 to 100 more simulated objects in each radius bin than were actually observed .",
    "\\(6 ) the likelihood of the model producing the observed distribution of radii was estimated by assuming poisson detection statistics with the number of `` detected '' simulated objects providing the expectation value for each bin .",
    "this dataset consists of the 57 ckbos found by 01tjl , and the single ckbo found in the kpno survey ( 1999 @xmath83 ) .",
    "although the 01tjl data contains many more objects , the kpno survey has comparable area coverage , and number of bright object discoveries .",
    "\\(7 ) steps 1 - 6 were repeated , each time varying the size distribution index , @xmath74 , and the total number of classical kbos , @xmath84 , with the ultimate goal of finding the number of ckbos and size distribution that has the maximum likelihood of producing the observations .    the primary process we are modeling is the effect of heliocentric distance @xmath24 and geocentric distance @xmath81 on the apparent red magnitude @xmath47 , and the resulting probability of detection based on detection efficiency ( equation  [ kpnoeff ] ) and survey area .",
    "the inclination distribution assumed in table  [ model ] is equivalent to the best - fit value found by 01tjl  a gaussian model with half - width of 20 deg .",
    "the true ecliptic latitude distribution of observed fields was used in the simulation , so no explicit correction for finite belt thickness is necessary , as needed in the clf fit (   [ clfsection ] ) .",
    "the results for the best - fit size distribution index , @xmath74 , and number of classical kbos with diameters @xmath5 km , @xmath85 , are presented in figure  [ kboqdist ] .",
    "this figure depicts the contours of constant probability that the given @xmath74 and @xmath86 , could produce the observed distribution .",
    "we find that @xmath87 this estimate of @xmath74 is in formal agreement with that derived from the clf alone at @xmath88 level .    the results for @xmath74 to not depend sensitively on our model assumptions .",
    "our values for @xmath89 are somewhat dependent on the inclination distribution assumed , as thicker inclination distributions can hide more objects at high ecliptic latitudes where no observations were made .",
    "for example , increasing the half - width of the inclination distribution by a factor of two , from 20 deg to 40 deg results in an increase in the best - fit @xmath90 , from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , a factor 1.6 .",
    "the best - fit value for @xmath85 is roughly linear with half - width @xmath93 , following @xmath94 .      adopting the best - fit @xmath95 , we simulated the clf that would be found by our survey given several different maximum sizes for the classical kbos , with results appearing in figure  [ maxradius ] .",
    "the expected clf from the classical kbos was multiplied by the observed kbo : classical kbo ratio ( 89:58 ) to construct this graph , which makes the implicit assumption that the clf of the classical kbos matches that of the kbos as a whole .",
    "this assumption is reasonable , as a maximum - likelihood fit to the clf for the classical kbos alone ( @xmath96 ) is statistically consistent with the fit to all observed populations ( @xmath63 ,   [ clfsection ] ) .",
    "our analysis rules out the @xmath97 km and @xmath98 km diameter maximum sizes , as is expected since we found one body with diameter @xmath99 km and another with @xmath100 km .",
    "the @xmath101 km simulation is the best - fit to our data , however , these data are formally consistent will all greater @xmath102 .",
    "thus , if there is a maximum size cutoff , it is greater than or equal to @xmath101 km , because we do not observe a significant surface density decrease for bright objects beyond that described by the linear slope of the clf .",
    "this analysis is in agreement with all other published wide - field surveys except for kowal ( 1989 ) .",
    "kowal s ( 1989 ) datum could be explained by a precipitous drop in surface density between @xmath103 , as would be expected if there were a maximum size of @xmath104 km to the kbos .",
    "such a model would be in violation of the tombaugh ( 1961 ) datum point , unless pluto is considered a special case . in either case ,",
    "our observations indicate that if there is a maximum size , it must be @xmath105 .",
    "the number of large kbos is of fundamental interest because it is a direct measurement of the runaway accretion in the planet forming era of the solar system ( kenyon & luu 1998 ) .",
    "two sizes of typical interest are the number of charon - sized bodies ( @xmath106 km in diameter ) and the number of pluto - sized bodies ( @xmath107 km in diameter ) .",
    "the number of bodies with diameters larger than @xmath108 , given by @xmath109 , can be directly calculated from the results of our maximum likelihood simulation . for @xmath110 , @xmath111    thus , from figure  [ kboqdist ] ,",
    "we find that the total numbers of charon- and pluto - sized bodies in the classical kuiper belt follow @xmath112 thus , assuming that the @xmath95 size distribution continues to large sizes , we expect that there are @xmath113 ( @xmath114 lower - limit ) undiscovered pluto - sized bodies in the classical kuiper belt and @xmath115 ( @xmath114 lower - limit ) charon - sized bodies , of which only a few have been discovered .",
    "if the size distributions of the classical and scattered kbos are identical , then a similar number of bodies should be present in the scattered kuiper belt , which has approximately the same number of bodies ( trujillo , jewitt & luu 2000 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the kuiper belt growth models of kenyon and luu ( 1998 , 1999 ) using velocity evolution and collisional fragmentation . in these models ,",
    "several pluto - sized bodies grow concurrently in a low - mass ( @xmath116 ) disk .",
    "these models have two characteristic observable parameters : ( 1 ) the size distribution of the resulting kuiper belt corresponds to @xmath117 , and ( 2 ) several large bodies are formed concurrently .",
    "their favored model produces @xmath118 charon - sized bodies and 1 pluto - sized body in 36.5 myr ( kenyon and luu 1999a ) and is roughly consistent with our observations , although no prediction is made about the subsequent destruction rates of such bodies from catastrophic collisions .",
    "the possibility of finding these pluto- and charon- sized bodies can be estimated by examining the discovery conditions of other bright bodies .",
    "table  [ brightdisc ] lists the three kbos to date brighter than red magnitude @xmath119 that have been found in published surveys ( with the exception of pluto ) .",
    "these three bodies were found in the heliocentric distance range 3039 au .",
    "assuming opposition observations and 4% albedo , 2000 km and 1000 km diameter bodies at these heliocentric distances would have have brightnesses @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively , according to equation  [ mreq ] .",
    "these magnitudes are within range for most time - resolved wide - field survey telescopes , however the apparent motion of these bodies , @xmath122 /hr , is considerably slower than @xmath29 /hr main - belt asteroids . since most such observing programs are designed to find near - earth asteroids and other high proper motion planetary bodies , plate scales and timebases between images are not usually conducive to finding the kbos .",
    "thus , special observing procedures or software methods must be adopted to find the slower kbos , as has been done by spacewatch ( larsen et al .",
    "a time - resolved all - sky @xmath123 magnitude survey should be able to find all the remaining pluto- and charon- sized bodies , as long as suitable measures are taken to detect @xmath122 /hr bodies .",
    "such a survey could be conducted with a dedicated 1 meter class telescope outfitted with a ccd camera allowing a wide - field of view , similar to the kpno 0.9 m and 8k ccd mosaic instrument combination used in this work .",
    "these analyses presume that the kbos have a 4% albedo , consistent with the centaurs ( jewitt & luu 2000 ) .",
    "if the mean kbo albedo , @xmath80 , departs from this value , then the radial sizes of the bodies will be affected by a factor @xmath124 . for a 14% albedo such as that of chiron ( campins et al .",
    "1995 ) and a 38% albedo such as found for charon ( buie , tholen & wasserman 1997 ) , this amounts to a size factor 1.9 and 3.1 , respectively .    the total amount of mass in 1000 km to 2000 km diameter classical kbos for our best - fit @xmath125 case is @xmath126 with @xmath127 representing the bulk density , @xmath80 denoting the albedo , and @xmath128 kg .",
    "this accounts for 18% of the total mass found in @xmath129 bodies .",
    "again , the scattered kbos may contain a similar amount of material .",
    "although there is no formal international astronomical union definition of the centaur population , we classify bodies whose perihelia fall between that of jupiter and neptune as centaurs , similar to the larsen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) definition .",
    "one such centaur was found in the kpno 8k data ( 2000 @xmath130 ) .",
    "we therefore estimate the sky - plane density of centaurs to be @xmath131 ( @xmath62 ) centaurs per sq deg at our survey limiting magnitude @xmath21 .",
    "this is consistent with other recent estimates of the centaur population : larsen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) predict a value of @xmath132 at our limiting magnitude and sheppard et al .",
    "( 2000 ) predict a similar surface density of @xmath133 centaurs per sq deg .",
    "we have conducted a survey for kbos and centaurs with the kpno 0.9 m telescope and 8k mosaic ccd , which together provide a nearly 1 sq deg field of view , reaching red magnitude @xmath134 in 200 s in typical seeing conditions at kitt peak .",
    "we detected 3 kbos and 1 centaur in 164 sq deg examined near the ecliptic . combining these new data with the results of trujillo , jewitt & luu ( 2001 )",
    ", we find the following results :      \\(2 ) the classical kbos follow a @xmath137 ( @xmath62 ) differential size distribution , with the total number of classical kbos with diameters larger than 100 km given by @xmath138 , assuming a gaussian inclination distribution with half - width 20 deg .",
    "\\(4 ) assuming the differential size distribution extends to large sizes , the total number of classical kbos with diameters @xmath140 km and @xmath141 km is @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively ( @xmath62 ) . the bodies in the @xmath142 diameter range account for @xmath143 of the total mass in the @xmath144 diameter range , representing @xmath145 , assuming a bulk density of 1000 @xmath146 .",
