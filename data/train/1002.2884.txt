    "we find a similar effect in the scattering of vector bosons , and also in the standard rs model for cross sections involving the lorentz - violating contribution from the massive bulk vector field .",
    "the main feature of our models is the amplification of the nc effects at the resonance , while they are strongly suppressed outside the resonance region .",
    "this offers the possibility to detect  together with the additional massive particles due to the extradimensional setup ",
    "effects of spacetime nc in particle collisions at the tev scale .",
    "1= 2=      comparing our models to experimental bounds from laboratory experiments and astrophysics is possible by considering the effective lorentz - violating operators which are induced for the sm photon propagator . in our models ,",

    "exploiting the relation of the poisson tensor to the b - field as motivated by string theory in the low - energy description in terms of gauged supergravity on @xmath1 , we found preferred choices for the radial - coordinate dependence where the poisson tensor is exponentially localized towards either the uv or ir brane .    assuming the poisson tensor to be confined to one of the branes , we classified the effective lorentz - violating operators arising from brane - localized nc interactions for bulk particles , namely the graviton , radion and a bulk u(1 ) gauge field .",
