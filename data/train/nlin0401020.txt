    "the understanding of the small scale statistics of turbulent systems is a problem of considerable interest @xcite . with turbulent systems , we mean both the dynamics of velocity fields in high - reynolds number flows , and the advection of scalar or vector fields by turbulent flows as , e.g. , temperature or magnetic fields . in the last few years",
    ", much progress has been reached both in experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite investigations of turbulent systems .",
    "we have now plenty of observations showing that two properties generally holds .",
    "first , turbulent systems are intermittent @xcite , as quantified by the anomalous scaling of moments of field increments .",
    "second , the anomalous scaling exponents display universality with respect to the boundary conditions and to the _ large scale _ forcing mechanisms @xcite .",
    "some subtle points arise when isotropy is broken at large scale by the injection mechanisms @xcite . in that case , for universality to hold it is required that anisotropic contributions are subleading with respect to the isotropic one .",
    "however , evidences for universality of both isotropic and anisotropic scaling exponents have been found @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the mechanisms responsible for anomalous scaling and universality in turbulent systems are still not fully comprehended with the remarkable exception of linear problems such as the passive transport of a field , for which intermittency and universality have been systematically understood ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an exhaustive review ) . in this context , in particular for the class of kraichnan models @xcite ,",
    "closed equations for the correlation functions can be derived .",
    "these are linear partial differential equations , whose homogeneous solutions ( zero modes ) generally exhibit anomalous scaling . on the other hand , the inhomogeneous solutions , constrained by the external forcing , possess dimensional ( non - anomalous ) scaling .",
    "universality results then from the decoupling between the zero modes scaling and the forcing .",
    "remarkably , the zero modes can be interpreted as statistically preserved structures , i.e. functions that do not change in time once averaged over the velocity field realisations and particle trajectories .",
    "this allowed for successfully testing the entire picture also for the advection by realistic velocity fields @xcite , and in the context of shell models for passive transport @xcite .    on the theoretical side",
    ", it is tempting to export the concepts issuing from linear turbulent systems to nonlinear ones , i.e. to see whether the same mechanisms for anomalous scaling and universality are at work also in nonlinear hydrodynamic systems such as navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "a possible test case to probe universality with respect to the forcing mechanisms is to study turbulent fluctuations stirred at all scales by a self - similar power - law random forcing .",
    "indeed , the non - analytical properties of the forcing may alter the energy exchange between the turbulent field fluctuations .",
    "for instance , in some cases , the energy injection mechanism may prevail over the energy cascade process , modifying the inertial range physics .",
    "this problem was pioneered by means of renormalisation group ( rg ) methods @xcite , in the late 70s , for the @xmath2-dimensional navier - stokes equations . in the rg calculations , for @xmath3 ,",
    "the forcing spectrum is chosen as @xmath4 with @xmath5 playing the role of a small parameter in perturbative expansions .",
    "unfortunately the interesting physical case , obtained for @xmath6 and corresponding to the kolmogorov spectrum for the velocity field , lies in a range where convergence of the rg expansion is not granted @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding extensions of the rg formalism to @xmath7 values have been tempted by different approaches @xcite , the problem is still open .",
    "recent numerical simulations tried to shed light on this issue @xcite but , because of the limited resolution , their results are not conclusive .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the general issue of the small scale statistical properties of linear and nonlinear hydro - dynamical systems , in the presence of stirring acting at all scales with a power - law spectrum .",
    "a systematic study of the scaling behaviour at varying the forcing spectrum allows indeed for understanding the interplay of dimensional and anomalous scaling in turbulent fields .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ps ] , as an instance of linear problems , we consider passive scalars stirred at all scales by a power - law forcing , and advected by a @xmath0 turbulent velocity field .",
    "our results confirm the universality scenario originating from the zero modes picture which predicts two distinct regimes . _",
    "forcing - dominated _ regime : the scaling of low order structure functions is non - anomalous , with exponents dimensionally related to the forcing spectrum ; for the higher order moments , scaling is anomalous and dominated by the zero modes .",
    "_ forcing - subleading _ regime : the dimensional scaling related to the balance with the forcing is subleading , at any order , with respect to the anomalous one , similarly to the case of a standard large scale injection . hence , anomalous scaling is observed for any order statistics . a subtle technical point revealed by the passive scalar case is the existence of many important power - law terms that contribute to the scaling properties . as clarified in sec .",
    "[ sec : ps ] , for both regimes , to disentangle the authentic scaling behaviours , it is necessary to take into account the leading as well as the subleading terms . concerning nonlinear systems , in sec .",
    "[ sec : nl ] , we review the numerical study of the @xmath1 navier - stokes equations done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where due to natural limitation in the resolution only semi - quantitative results were obtained . then , to overcome this difficulty , we consider shell models for turbulence .",
    "these are nonlinear models that maintain most of the richness of the original problem but allow for reaching higher reynolds numbers .",
    "shell model results coherently fit with the passive scalar and ns ones .",
    "conclusions follow in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the evolution of a passive scalar field @xmath8 advected by an incompressible flow @xmath9 is governed by the advection - diffusion equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the molecular diffusivity .",
    "the standard phenomenology is as follows .",
    "scalar fluctuations are injected at large scale by the source term @xmath12 ; then , by a cascade mechanism induced by the advection term , they reach small scales where dissipation takes place balancing the input , and holding the system in a statistically stationary state .",
    "since the problem is passive , it can be studied also with a synthetic velocity field mimicking some of the features of realistic turbulent flows .",
    "much attention has been recently devoted to the kraichnan model @xcite , where @xmath9 is a gaussian , incompressible , homogeneous , isotropic and @xmath13-correlated in time field of zero mean .",
    "the only reminiscence of real turbulent flows is the existence of a scaling behaviour that , due to the assumed self - similarity , is fixed by a unique exponent , i.e. @xmath14 with @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 ) . for the sake of analytical control ,",
    "the forcing @xmath12 is also taken as a gaussian , homogeneous , isotropic field of zero mean and with correlation function : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 decays rapidly for @xmath19 , identifying @xmath20 as the large scale of the problem .",
    "thanks to the above simplifying assumptions , a closed equation for the generic @xmath21-point correlator , @xmath22 , can be derived .",
    "it formally reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the forcing spatial correlation defined above , and @xmath25 is a linear differential operator coming from the diffusion and the advection terms ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the stationary solution of ( [ eq : correlaps ] ) satisfies the equation @xmath26 . as usual , a linear equation is solved by the superposition of the solution of the associated homogeneous equation , @xmath27 , and the solution of the inhomogeneous one , which will be denoted as @xmath28 . in the inertial range of scales both @xmath29 and @xmath30 display a scaling behaviour , i.e. @xmath31 where the scaling exponents @xmath32 are fixed by dimensionally matching the inertial operator with the forcing , while the @xmath33 , not constrained by any dimensional requirements , are independent of the forcing .",
    "one is usually interested in the @xmath21-point irreducible component of the correlation function , @xmath34 , that is the structure function @xmath35 .",
    "still in the framework of kraichnan model , the zero modes scaling exponents contributing to @xmath36 have been calculated perturbatively in @xcite .",
    "it has been found that @xmath37 for @xmath38 , i.e. the leading contribution to the structure function scaling is anomalous .",
    "the zero modes dominance scenario explains both the anomalous scaling exponents and their universality .",
    "indeed the forcing does not enter the definition of @xmath39 , but fixes only the multiplicative constants in front of @xmath40 and @xmath39 , necessary to match the large scale boundary conditions .",
    "this implies that , even though scaling exponents are universal , probability density functions ( pdf ) of scalar increments are not . the above picture based on zero modes is now recognised to apply in all linear hydrodynamic problems .",
    "as confirmed by investigations of passive advection by realistic velocity fields @xcite , and of shell models for passive transport @xcite .",
    "let us now focus on the main issue of this work : the scaling behaviour in the presence of forcing fluctuations directly injected in the inertial range of scales .",
    "we consider the case of a source term @xmath41 which is a random gaussian scalar field , with zero mean , white - in - time and characterised by the spectrum @xmath42 in the following , it is always assumed the presence of ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs for the forcing , i.e. expression ( [ def : force_ps ] ) holds only in the range @xmath43 of wave - numbers , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are of the order of the inverse of the largest scale in the system and of the dissipative scale , respectively .",
    "remaining in the framework of the kraichnan model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlaps ] ) still holds , and its stationary solution is again the superposition of the homogeneous solution , @xmath39 , which remains unchanged ( _ viz . _ with the same scaling exponents ) and of the inhomogeneous one , @xmath46 , whose scaling exponents now depend on the slope of the forcing spectrum , @xmath47 .",
    "indeed by dimensional reasoning , we have @xmath48 .    two regimes can be identified . if @xmath49 , the scaling of the inhomogeneous solution is always subleading with respect to the anomalous one .",
    "the scaling exponents measured from the structure functions are the same as those obtained with the standard large scale forcing .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath50 , there exists a critical order @xmath51 such that for @xmath52 : @xmath53 , and for @xmath54 : @xmath55 .",
    "in other words , the scaling behaviour of the low - order structure functions is non - anomalous and dominated by the forcing .",
    "the appearing of anomalous scaling for @xmath54 can be understood due the fact that @xmath33 as a function of @xmath21 is concave .",
    "moreover , it is known numerically @xcite and to some degree analytically @xcite that in the kraichnan model the scaling exponents above a certain order saturate to a finite value , @xmath56 , which makes even more intuitive the existence of a finite @xmath51 .",
    "some subtle points may arise for positive @xmath47 larger than @xmath57 .",
    "in such a case , the strong uv components of the forcing spectrum may allow a matching with zero modes , disregarded for a large scale forcing @xcite , exploding at small scales . finally , the case @xmath58 is marginal , because the exponents @xmath59 coincide with the large scale prediction , up to possible logarithmic corrections .    checking",
    "the validity of the above predictions in numerical simulations of a realistic flow is interesting for two reasons .",
    "first , it is a further demonstration , in the eulerian framework , of the zero modes picture for anomalous scaling and universality in linear problems , which was previously assayed with lagrangian studies @xcite .",
    "second , it offers a controlled testing ground for interpreting some aspects of the nonlinear hydrodynamics which will be considered in the next section .    as an example of realistic velocity field",
    ", we consider two - dimensional incompressible navier - stokes equations in the inverse cascade regime @xcite : @xmath60 the terms in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2dns ] ) have the following meaning : @xmath61 is the pressure field ; @xmath62 injects kinetic energy at scale @xmath63 ; @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 is the viscosity ) dissipates enstrophy at small scale ; @xmath66 removes energy at the large scales allowing for a statistically stationary state . in the inverse energy cascade regime ,",
    "the velocity statistics is self - similar ( not - intermittent ) , with @xmath67 , but temporal correlations are non trivial .",
    "moreover , precise numerical measurements of passive scalars with large scale forcing @xcite have shown that : @xmath68 while for @xmath38 the exponents are anomalous , and saturation is observed for @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "it is noteworthy that saturation seems to be generic in passive scalars , as found also in experiments @xcite . from a physical point of view , it means that the strongest scalar fluctuations are statistically dominated by front - like structures , i.e. huge variations of the field @xmath8 at very small scales .",
    "once a power law forcing ( [ def : force_ps ] ) is considered , the predicted dimensional scaling is @xmath71 .",

    "@xmath137 can be sketched as , @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the integro - differential linear operator coming from the inertial and pressure terms , @xmath140 is the differential operator describing dissipative effects and @xmath141 is the two - point forcing correlator .",
    "unfortunately , since the hierarchy ( [ eq : closure ] ) is unclosed , no straight - forward analytical approache can be done . even though nothing can be rigorously said ,",
    "one may still be tempted to assume that anomalous scaling is brought by the inertial operator . however , the presence of finite size effects , due to the limited inertial range , in dns data of @xmath1 navier - stokes simulations @xcite provide only a semi - quantitative support to this scenario . as we shall see in the next section",
    ", more quantitative statements can be made in the context of shell models for turbulence , for which resolution constraints are much less severe .",
    "shell models of turbulence are dynamical systems mimicking navier - stokes nonlinear evolution @xcite .",
    "their main advantage relies on the possibility of performing high reynolds number simulations to measure statistical properties , say intermittent corrections , with high accuracy .",
    "the model we use , proposed in @xcite , is an improved version of the goy model @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the evolution equation is : @xmath142 the velocity field fluctuation at the wavenumber @xmath143 , with @xmath144 , is expressed in terms of the complex variable @xmath145 ; @xmath146 is a free parameter and @xmath65 indicates the viscosity .",
    "the number of shells varies as @xmath147 .",
    "remarkably , for large scale forcing , the structure functions show anomalous scaling : @xmath148 deviating from the dimensional prediction @xmath149 .",
    "moreover , anomalous scaling exponents are found to be universal with respect to the forcing , provided it is large scale ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we aim at investigating the properties of the model stirred by a white - in - time , gaussian field , with zero mean and spectrum @xmath150 being @xmath151 the forcing intensity .",
    "a similar injection mechanism was proposed in @xcite where authors tried to compare the power - law forced shell models with fractal - grid induced turbulence @xcite . in order to understand the effect of forcing as ( [ def : shellforce ] )",
    "let us start with the energy flux , which obeys an exact equation .",
    "denoting with @xmath152 the time derivative of the energy content up to the scale @xmath153 , the energy balance relation can be written as : @xmath154 in the previous expression , @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the energy flux through the shell @xmath153 defined as @xmath157 for the forcing ( [ def : shellforce ] ) and for @xmath158 , we get an exact prediction in the stationary state : @xmath159 where the constants @xmath160 , bound by the equation of motion to have opposite signs , depend on the forcing details ( @xmath151 , @xmath47 ) and on the integral wavenumber @xmath161 . at this level , where everything is exact , we see that when @xmath47 approaches the critical value ( @xmath58 ) , a large number of shells is needed to distinguish leading terms from subleading ones in the third order moment . in our runs , the choice of a large value for @xmath162 , allow us to have a good control of such effects .     , @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "for the random forcing , acting on all shells of the inertial range , we chose the following values of @xmath47 : @xmath84 ( green squares ) , @xmath165 ( red circles ) .",
    "fits are made with a superposition of two power - law contributions , in agreement with ( [ eq : shellflusso ] ) .",
    "insets : compensation with the leading power law ( dotted ) or with two power laws for @xmath84 ( bottom inset ) and @xmath165 ( top inset ) .",
    "right : same as left panel but for the second order flux moment , to be compared with ( [ eq : sub ] ) .",
    "also here the two power laws terms have opposite signs.,title=\"fig : \" ]    similarly to the ns case ( [ eq : closure ] ) , we can write the unclosed hierarchy for the multi - point correlators of shell variables : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the generic correlation function of order @xmath21 , @xmath168 is the linear operator coming from the inertial terms , and @xmath169 is the two - point forcing operator .",
    "the main difference with the case of passive scalar transport , as pointed out in the previous subsection , is that now the system ( [ shell : eqs ] ) is not closed , i.e. we have more unknowns than equations . without any ambition of a rigorous approach",
    ", we may imagine that the general solution is characterised by two terms .",
    "the first , @xmath170 , given by the dimensional matching between the inertial operator and the forcing operator , @xmath171 the second , @xmath30 , associated to a `` zero mode '' of the inertial operator , namely a solution of the homogeneous equation , @xmath172 . here , as for the linear problem ,",
    "the non homogeneous terms are the only contributions depending on the forcing , while the homogeneous ones , dimensionally unconstrained , may show anomalous scaling . in particular , for the structure functions @xmath173 , we have @xmath174 where @xmath175 . this implies the following behaviour for the second order moment of the flux ( equivalent to the sixth - order structure function ) : @xmath176 where the power @xmath177 coincides with the anomalous exponent measured for sixth - order structure function with a large scale forcing , and the value @xmath178 comes from the dimensional prediction ( [ eq : ino ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] the first and second moments of the flux variables are shown for both the subleading and dominant forcing with @xmath165 and @xmath84 , respectively . it is easy to see that to get a good agreement of the numerical results with the prediction ( [ eq : sub ] ) , both the leading and the subleading power laws have to be taken into account . for both cases with @xmath84 and @xmath165 , at least for the order of the statistics we could reach , the anomalous scaling exponents have values in agreement with those found for a large scale forcing , supporting the universality scenario .",
    "we have discussed the problem of small scale fluctuations in turbulent systems stirred at all scales by a power - law forcing . the main question in our study concerns anomalous",
    "scaling and universality of scaling exponents .    for linear systems ",
    "i.e. passive transport , we find clear evidence for the universality of anomalous fluctuations and our results fit well in the zero mode scenario . in the regime",
    "in which forcing is subleading anomalous scaling is recovered in quantitative agreement with the case of large scale forcing . in the forcing dominated regime ,",
    "the dimensional scaling imposed by the injection mechanism overwhelms the anomalous fluctuations of low order moments .",
    "nevertheless , anomalous scaling shows up again for high enough moments , independently of the forcing spectrum slope , as confirmed by the existence of a unique saturation exponent in all regimes .",
    "the results obtained for nonlinear turbulent systems point in the same direction . indeed both the semi - quantitative results obtained in the context of @xmath1 navier - stokes turbulence and those more quantitative issuing from the investigation of the shell models are compatible with the linear systems scenario for universality . however , in the presence of power - law forcing acting in the turbulent energy cascade range , as shown both in the linear and nonlinear cases , scaling properties are strongly spoiled by the beating of leading and subleading terms .",
    "this effect is particularly strong due to cancellations induced by different signed pre - factors in the power - law terms .",
    "strong cancellation effects , which apparently are a mere technical question , may lead to misinterpretation in analysing data .",
    "we wonder , for example , if the observed multi - fractal behaviour in the one - dimensional burgers equation stirred by a power - law forcing might be a spurious effect @xcite .",
