    "factorization theorems for inclusive single - hadron production @xcite guarantee that the dominant mechanism for a hadron production with high @xmath2 is _ fragmentation _",
    "@xcite , the production of a parton which subsequently decays into the hadron and other partons .",
    "many of the theoretical uncertainties disappear in the high @xmath2 region and fragmentation is , therefore , a nice probe of the hadron production mechanism .",
    "this process is described by a fragmentation function @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the hadron and @xmath5 is a factorization scale .",
    "the earliest calculations of fragmentation functions exploited the fact that the fragmentation function is independent of the production processes of the decaying parton .",
    "for example , the fragmentation functions for heavy quark@xcite and for quarkonia @xcite were deduced by comparing the production cross sections for the hadron with the form predicted by the factorization theorems for inclusive single - hadron production .",
    "a field - theoretical definition of the fragmentation function can be expressed as matrix elements of bilocal operators in a light - cone gauge @xcite or , more generally , as matrix elements of nonlocal gauge - invariant operators @xcite .",
    "the collins - soper definition of the fragmentation function was first used by ma to calculate a fragmentation function for heavy quarkonium in leading order @xcite and in next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "the definition is particularly convenient for carrying out calculations beyond leading order in @xmath6 , and it allows for the calculation in the feynman gauge . by using the feynman gauge , one can avoid the problem caused by the ambiguity of the spurious pole of the gluon propagator in the light - cone gauge . on the other hand",
    ", one must calculate a number of diagrams which do not appear in the light - cone gauge . in higher - order corrections to a fragmentation function ,",
    "the simplicity in the light - cone gauge is remarkable , provided the spurious poles are handled correctly .",
    "the spurious pole problem does not appear in tree - level real - parton corrections .",
    "however , when we calculate a virtual correction to an amplitude in the light - cone gauge , we should keep in mind the possible problem caused by the spurious pole . a naive way to evaluate such light - cone dependent integrals",
    "is known as the cauchy principal value ( pv ) prescription .",
    "if we use the pv prescription , there exist the ill - defined spurious pole in some loop integral . without introducing _ ad hoc _ assumptions ,",
    "these integrals are not calculable using dimensional regularization .",
    "an elegant method has been presented by mandelstam and leibbrandt independently@xcite .",
    "the ml prescription made it possible to transform such an integral into a well - defined one .",
    "the derivation of the altarelli - parisi evolution of parton densities @xcite is one of the best examples of the use of the light - cone gauge .",
    "all previous calculations beyond - leading order had to employ some prescription for the spurious pole .",
    "the pv prescription is used in refs .",
    "the ml prescription is employed in the leading order @xcite and the next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "a safe way to fix the prescription for the spurious pole is to find the gauge transformation relation from another gauge , such as the feynman gauge , where all the poles are well defined .",
    "fortunately , at least for the case of the fragmentation function calculation , one may make use of the gauge - invariant property of the fragmentation function of collins and soper .",
    "one notices that the spurious pole in the light - cone gauge is transformed into the propagator of the eikonal operator in the feynman gauge which makes the nonlocal operators of the decaying partons , quark or gluon , gauge - invariant .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary to introduce a prescription for the spurious pole structure . instead , by matching the result from the light - cone gauge , where the spurious pole has an ambiguity , with the well - defined feynman gauge result , one can determine the structure by virtue of gauge invariance .    in this work",
    ", we develop a way to calculate next - to - leading order corrections to a fragmentation function in the light - cone gauge . instead of employing any known prescription for the spurious pole , we determine the sign of @xmath7 in the spurious pole by using only gauge invariance .",
    "it is fixed by comparing the light - cone gauge result with that from another gauge where there is no such ambiguity .",
    "this method , which has not been used before , is derived straight - forwardly from the gauge independent definition of the fragmentation function given by collins and soper @xcite . by choosing the gauge - fixing vector @xmath8 with vanishing transverse component with respect to the momentum of the produced hadron",
    ", we observe that the ill - defined spurious poles in one - loop integrals disappear , at least in our example .",
    "the reason is that the transverse momenta of the final states are integrated out . as an application , we re -",
    "derive the short - distance coefficients for the color - octet @xmath0 term in the fragmentation function for a gluon to split into polarized heavy quarkonium states to order @xmath1 .",
    "there are two previous calculations of this function which disagree with each other @xcite .",
    "we use both the feynman gauge and the light - cone gauge .",
    "we fix the sign of @xmath7 in the spurious pole by matching the two calculations .",
    "our results from the two gauges agree with each other before the evaluation of the loop integrals .",
    "we remove ultraviolet divergences using the @xmath9 renormalization procedure .",
    "our result agrees with the recent calculation of braaten and lee @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : lc ] , we give a short description of the spurious pole problem in the light - cone gauge , evaluate the one - loop renormalization constants in the light - cone gauge and compare our results with those based on the pv and the ml prescriptions . in section [ sec : cs ] , we describe the method based on the collins - soper definition for the calculation of a fragmentation function in the light - cone gauge . as an application of our method , we give in section [ sec : cal ] the result for the color - octet @xmath0 term in the fragmentation function for a gluon to split into heavy quarkonia .",
    "a discussion is presented in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "the light - cone gauge is a physical gauge where the gluon field @xmath10 has vanishing light - cone projection @xmath11 where @xmath8 is an arbitrary light - like vector ( @xmath12 ) appearing in the gauge - fixing term in the qcd lagrangian . in the light - cone gauge , in which the fragmentation function was originally defined @xcite , the eikonal line as well as the ghost decouples from the gluon , since the coupling , proportional to @xmath13 , is orthogonal to the gluon propagator .",

    "one need to introduce some assumptions .",
    "various prescriptions for the spurious pole have been proposed . as a naive way , the pv prescription assumes @xmath17 .",

    "the spurious pole is re - expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a conjugate light - like vector satisfying @xmath20 .",
    "its spatial components are opposite in sign to those of @xmath8 .",
    "the merit of the ml prescription is that it allows us for a proper wick rotation to evaluate the integral in euclidean space . in the ml prescription ,",
    "the reduction of tensor integrals into scalar integrals , and the evaluation of scalar integrals , can be very involved due to the introduction of one more light - like vector @xmath19 .",
    "the reason is that the light - cone vector has a non - vanishing transverse component compared to that of the propagator momentum .",
    "let us classify the integrals involving spurious poles into two classes in view of the naive pv prescription which does not include any other assumption but ( [ pv ] ) .",
    "first , there is an integral with the _ ambiguous _ spurious pole .",
    "this integral can be regularized using dimensional regularization imposing the pv prescription ( [ pv ] ) .",
    "the integral can be evaluated by using the ml prescription as well . once we choose @xmath8 arbitrarily , some loop - integrals depending on this spurious pole are ill - defined even under dimensional regularization within the pv prescription .",
    "for example , there is a scalar integral in the gluon self - energy diagram : @xmath21\\ ; k\\cdot n } , \\label{ill } % ----------------------\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is loop momentum .",
    "if we use the pv prescription without any further assumption , the integral ( [ ill ] ) is proportional to the ill - defined gamma function @xmath22 even though we use the regularized dimension @xmath23 .",
    "let us call this by the integral having the _ ill - defined _ spurious pole",
    ". in the ml prescription , the integral ( [ ill ] ) becomes a well - defined one .",
    "however , it is dangerous to impose an _ ad hoc _ prescription for these spurious poles .",
    "once we employ such a prescription , we must check renormalizability and unitarity , the cancelation of infrared ( ir ) divergence , case by case .",
    "fortunately , in the case of the fragmentation function calculation , there is a possibility to fix the spurious pole structure by using gauge invariance , so we do not have to depend on a specific prescription . in covariant gauges such as the feynman gauge , there is no such problem .",
    "the spurious pole from the gluon propagator in the light - cone gauge is transformed into the propagator of the eikonal line in the feynman gauge . and",
    "the @xmath7 sign for the eikonal line propagator is well defined .",
    "if we calculate a gauge - invariant quantity in the two gauges and compare the two results , we may fix the spurious pole ambiguity in the light - cone gauge .    as an example , let us consider the next - to - leading order calculation of a fragmentation function .",
    "the natural choice of the light - cone vector @xmath8 for defining a fragmentation function is @xmath24 , which has vanishing transverse components relative to the daughter - particle momentum @xmath25 . in general ,",
    "any fragmentation function is expressed in terms of the scalar products among vectors @xmath26 , @xmath8 , and @xmath27 . since the transverse dependence is integrated out in the fragmentation function and",
    "the daughter particle is on its mass shell , the conjugate light - cone vector @xmath19 is no longer independent of @xmath26 and @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the fragmentation function in the light - cone gauge becomes dependent only on @xmath26 and @xmath8 even if we use the ml prescription . in this case , the quark wavefunction renormalization constant @xmath28 and the gluon propagator correction factor @xmath29 in one - loop level are given by @xmath30 , \\label{z : lc } \\\\",

    "the reason why the ill - defined spurious pole does not appear in the light - cone gauge calculations in ( [ z : lc ] ) and ( [ pi : lc ] ) is that we have chosen the light - like vector @xmath8 with vanishing transverse components relative to the momentum of the daughter particle .",
    "furthermore , their values are independent of the sign of the @xmath7 in the definition ( [ eq : c ] ) .",
    "since the integral is invariant under the inversion @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath47 defined in appendix a , it is trivial to obtain the relations : @xmath48 where the definition of the integral @xmath49 is the same as that of the integral @xmath50 except for the fact that @xmath51 is replaced by its complex conjugate @xmath52 . at least in this case",
    ", the values of the scalar integrals agree with those evaluated by using the pv prescription : @xmath53 the independence on the sign in front of the @xmath7 in @xmath38 might be accidental .",
    "if we use the ml prescription , each light - cone - dependent integral in ( [ lci ] ) has ultraviolet ( uv ) and ir structures which are different from those shown in appendix a. effectively , the ml prescription transforms a double pole into an ir pole and makes the integral satisfy naive power counting rules . note that @xmath33 and @xmath29 are gauge dependent .",

    "the dependence on the spectroscopic state of the produced quarkonium of this fragmentation function can be found in ref .",
    "we have shown how the light - cone gauge can be used to evaluate the perturbatively calculable parts of a fragmentation function . as an application",
    ", we tested our method by evaluating the next - to - leading order correction to the color - octet @xmath0 term in the gluon fragmentation function .",
    "we reproduced the recent result of braaten and lee @xcite which disagrees with that of ma @xcite .",
    "the light - cone gauge considerably simplifies the calculation procedure for both the real and the virtual corrections . at least at the one - loop level",
    ", the spurious pole problem can be resolved .",
    "this problem does not appear in the real corrections , because they come from tree - level diagrams , but it does appear in the virtual corrections .",
    "the gauge - invariant definition of the fragmentation function of collins and soper allows us to fix the ambiguities from spurious poles in the light - cone gauge by comparing with the result obtained in the feynman gauge .",
    "we reduced the virtual correction in the color - octet @xmath0 fragmentation function in the light - cone gauge to a linear combination of scalar integrals .",
    "after naive cancelations among the scalar integrals , ignoring the ambiguity from spurious poles , the correction reduces to scalar integrals that are independent of the sign of @xmath39 in the denominator @xmath116 .",
    "thus the pv prescription gives the correct answer . to see if the ml prescription also gives correct answer requires explicit calculations of the scalar integrals including ir and finite terms . as a byproduct ,",
    "the renormalization constants in the light - cone gauge were obtained at one - loop level .",
    "their uv dependencies agree with the previous calculations within the ml prescription .",
    "they might be useful for other calculations , such as the next - to - leading order corrections to other fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "were it not for the problem of the spurious pole , one could reduce a large amount of the intermediate calculation by using the light - cone gauge .",
    "if we choose the gauge - fixing vector @xmath8 with vanishing transverse components with respect to the momentum of the produced hadron , the one - loop integrals are remarkably simplified compared to the case using the ml prescription .",
    "we were able to determine the spurious pole structure without depending on a specific prescription by comparing with the result in the feynman gauge .",
    "of course , if we have to repeat the entire calculation using the feynman gauge to fix the spurious poles , the light - cone gauge will not save any labor . however , there are only a small number of integrals which have the spurious pole problem , and this provides a way to save labor .",
    "first calculate the full contribution in the light - cone gauge in terms of scalar integrals , without specifying any prescription for the spurious poles .",
    "then , calculate in the feynman gauge only those diagrams where the eikonal line couples with one or more gluons . by comparing the two results",
    ", we can determine the appropriate prescription for the spurious poles in the integrals .",
    "one restriction of this method is that it can only be applied to gauge - invariant quantities .",
    "the study of high-@xmath2 fragmentation phenomena has a significant potential to refine our understanding of hadron physics .",
    "it avoids the nontrivial resummations that complicate theoretical predictions for low-@xmath2 hadron processes .",
    "the signature of fragmentation dominance in high @xmath2 charmonium production has been observed in run i of the tevatron . in run",
    "ii of the tevatron , as well as at lhc and at future colliders , there will be much better statistics of high-@xmath2 heavy meson events .",
    "quantitative predictions for quarkonium production at high @xmath2 will require next - to - leading order calculations of all the phenomenologically relevant fragmentation functions .",
    "the light - cone gauge may be a powerful tool for carrying out these calculations .",
