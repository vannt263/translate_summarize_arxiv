    "two - level system coupled to a quantum harmonic oscillator ( e.g. , a single radiation mode ) as a simple and tractable model has played a central role in many branches of contemporary physics ranging from quantum optics to condensed matter physics . in quantum optics",
    "it describes a two level atom resonantly coupled to a single mode electromagnetic radiation @xcite , so called jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model @xcite .",
    "it accurately describes trapped ion experiments for quantum informatics @xcite . in condensed matter physics",
    "we may include here holstein model  @xcite , graphene in the magnetic field @xcite or in the quantized single mode radiation field @xcite , quantum dots coupled to photonic cavities @xcite , and circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) setups where superconducting qubits are coupled to microwave cavities @xcite .",
    "even though the underlying setups of mentioned systems are different , the physics is similar to cavity qed , where first experiments have been done toward the realization of jc model @xcite .",
    "cavity qed can be divided into three coupling regimes : weak , strong , and ultrastrong . for weak coupling atom - photon interaction rate",
    "is smaller than the atomic and cavity field decay rates . in this case",
    "one can manipulate by the spontaneous emission rate compared with its vacuum level by tuning discrete cavity modes @xcite . in strong coupling regime , when the emitter ",
    "photon interaction becomes larger than the combined decay rate , instead of the irreversible spontaneous emission process coherent periodic energy exchange between the emitter and the photon field in the form of rabi oscillations takes place @xcite .",
    "thanks to recent achievements in solid - state semiconductor @xcite or superconductor systems @xcite one can achieve ultrastrong coupling regime , where the coupling strength is comparable to appreciable fractions of the mode frequency . in this regime new nonlinear phenomena are visible @xcite . besides , in these setups one can enrich the conventional jc model including new interaction terms inaccessible in conventional cavity qed setups .",
    "one of the new factor which can be incorporated into the jc model is an inversion - symmetry - breaking ( isb ) .",
    "thus , in the conventional jc model , as well as in the rabi model with classical radiation field one assumes that the diagonal matrix elements of the dipole moment operator are zero , that is the states possess a certain spatial parity , and the levels are not degenerated .",
    "nevertheless , in various systems of interest , there is intrinsic or extrinsic reasons for isb .",
    "the inversion symmetry of a system can be broken either by a system hamiltonian or the stationary states may not have this symmetry . as has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , when the quantum system has permanent dipole moments in the stationary states , or the level is degenerated upon orbital momentum there are new multiphoton effects in the quantum dynamics of the system subjected to a strong laser field . furthermore , these systems have an advantage , which allows to generate radiation with rabi frequency @xcite and moderately high harmonics by optical pulses @xcite . for",
    "the semiconductor version of jc model one can achieve isb by the asymmetric quantum dots @xcite . in the circuit qed setups it appears naturally as a consequence of internal asymmetry . for flux qubit potential landscape",
    "is reduced to a double - well potential @xcite , for cooper pair box isb takes place at setup far from charge degeneracy point @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of interest to study the consequence of isb on the quantized version of rabi model , where multiphoton effects are expected in the ultrastrong coupling regime .    in the present work we study the effect of isb on the quantum dynamics of a two - level system interacting with a quantized harmonic oscillator .",
    "particularly , we consider the consequences of the isb on the eigenstates and eigenenergies of generalized jc hamiltonian , and on the dynamics of rabi oscillations , collapse and revival .",
    "it is shown that isb substantially alters the dynamics of the system compared with conventional jc one .",
    "similar to quasiclassical case @xcite it is possible direct multiphoton transitions , and as a consequence , there are rabi oscillations with periodic exchange of several photons between the emitter and the radiation ( bosonic ) field .",
    "we consider ultrastrong coupling regime .",
    "accordingly , the quantum dynamics of the considered system is investigated using a resonant approximation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the model hamiltonian is presented and diagonalized in the scope of a resonant approximation . in sec .",
    "iii we consider temporal quantum dynamics of considered system and present corresponding numerical simulations .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in sec .",
    "assuming here two level system with isb coupled to quantum harmonic oscillator , the model hamiltonian can be written as@xmath0@xmath1the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ h_m ] ) correspond to the free harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath2 and two level system with the transition frequency @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the final term gives the interaction between the oscillator and two level system .",
    "creation and annihilation operators , @xmath4and @xmath5 , satisfy the bosonic commutation rules , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are pauli operators , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are projection operators and are the result of isb .",
    "these terms distinguish the systems being considered from conventional jc model . at @xmath10 , one will obtain usual hamiltonian for jc model ( including also counter - rotating terms ) with coupling @xmath11 . in the case of atoms / molecules and quantum dots @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspond to mean dipole moments in states of indefinite parity , while @xmath14 corresponds to transition dipole moment . in the case of circuit qed see refs .",
    "@xcite . without loss of generality",
    "we have assumed that ground and excited states have mean dipole moments of opposite signs , and @xmath15 @xmath12 @xmath16 .        at",
    "first we will diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ h_m ] ) , which is straightforward in the dressed states picture . as jc model our model does not admit exact analytical solution .",
    "one of the most powerful approximations for the solution of jc model is the resonant or so called rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , which is valid at near - resonance @xmath17 @xmath2 and weak coupling between the two systems @xmath18  @xcite . for our model generalized multiphoton rwa",
    "is needed .",
    "the first step is to rewrite hamiltonian ( [ h_m ] ) in the form @xmath19where @xmath20 @xmath21 represents two non - coupled position - displaced oscillators:@xmath22@xmath23and@xmath24is the interaction part .",
    "hamiltonians ( [ ha ] ) and ( [ hb ] ) admit exact diagonalization",
    ". schematic illustration of the two position - displaced harmonic oscillators with coupling @xmath25 is given in fig .",
    "it is easy to see that in each well the eigenstates are@xmath26with energies@xmath27hear @xmath28 is the displacement operator and quantum number @xmath29 . the states @xmath30 , @xmath31 are eigenstates of @xmath32 and the states @xmath33 , @xmath34 are position - displaced fock states:@xmath35where @xmath36 is the lagger function and defined via generalized lagger polynomials @xmath37 as follows:@xmath38particularly , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the glauber or coherent states with mean number of photons @xmath41 and  @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we have two ladders shifted by the energy : @xmath43the coupling term ( [ h2 ] ) @xmath44 induces transitions between these two manifolds . at the resonance : @xmath45with @xmath46 the equidistant ladders are crossed : @xmath47 , and the energy levels starting from the ground state of upper harmonic oscillators are nearly degenerated .",
    "the coupling ( [ h2 ] ) removes this degeneracy , leading to symmetric and asymmetric entangled states .",
    "the splitting of levels is defined by the vacuum multiphoton rabi frequency . in this case",
    "we should apply secular perturbation theory resulting:@xmath48@xmath49where @xmath50 ; @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constant with ratio @xmath53 and transition matrix element is:@xmath54 i_{n - n , n}\\left ( \\frac{\\left ( \\lambda _ { g}+\\lambda _ { e}\\right ) ^{2}}{\\omega ^{2}}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{vn}\\]]for the exact resonance , starting from the @xmath55 we have symmetric and asymmetric entangled states@xmath56with energies @xmath57 , while for @xmath58 , we have eigenstates @xmath59 and energy @xmath60 .",
    "for the conventional jc model there is a selection rule : @xmath61 only for @xmath62 .",
    "this also follows from eq .",
    "( [ vn ] ) in the limit @xmath63 .",
    "that is why in that case only one photon rabi oscillations takes place . in our model due to isb",
    "there are transition with arbitrary @xmath64 giving rise to multiphoton coherent transitions .",
    "besides , at the @xmath65 in the ground state @xmath66 @xmath40 bosonic field is in the coherent state .",
    "the solutions ( [ dres ] ) are valid at near multiphoton resonance @xmath67 and weak coupling @xmath68 the latter condition implies that for the multiphoton resonant transitions , systems with large dipole moments ( @xmath69 ) are preferable .",
    "let us now consider the quantum dynamics of the two - level system and harmonic oscillator starting from an initial state , which is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ h_m ] ) .",
    "this is of particular interest for applications in quantum information processing . assuming arbitrary initial state @xmath70 of a system , then the state vector for times @xmath71 is just given by the expansion over dressed state basis obtained above:@xmath72@xmath73for concreteness we will consider two common initial conditions for harmonic oscillator : the fock state and the coherent state . we will calculate the time dependence of the two level system population inversion @xmath74 @xmath75 at the exact @xmath64-photon resonance ( [ res ] ) @xmath76 . for the field in the fock",
    "sate and two level system in the excited state @xmath77 , we have@xmath78where @xmath79 is the multiphoton vacuum rabi frequency . for @xmath80",
    "the main contribution in the sum ( [ w1 ] ) comes from the first term : @xmath81 , which corresponds to rabi oscillations with periodic exchange of @xmath64 photons between the two - level system and the radiation ( bosonic ) field .",
    "finally we turn to the case in which a two - level system begins in the ground state , while oscillator prepared in a coherent state with a mean excitation ( photon ) number @xmath82 . from eq .",
