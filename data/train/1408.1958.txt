    "there are not many known eclipsing binaries having such an early spectral type as @xmath5  cir ( hd  135240 , hr  5664 , hip 74778 ) . according to @xcite , the integrated type is o7.5iii(f ) ; but see later .",
    "the period is 390 , brightness @xmath65.@xmath705 @xmath8 5.@xmath720 .",
    "the orbit is eccentric , so the rotation of the apside line is to be expected .",
    "knowledge of the apse period is important , since there is only one other galactic binary of earlier spectral type with the known apsidal - line rotation period ",
    "hd  93205 @xcite , and others of similar spectral types as @xmath5  cir , v1007  sco @xcite , and hd  165052 @xcite .",
    "the first three radial velocities ( hereafter rvs ) of @xmath5  cir were obtained at the southern station of the lick observatory already in the year 1915 @xcite .",
    "additional rvs were secured by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "rvs and orbits for @xmath5  cir were published by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* te ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* st93 ) , and .",
    "the results of these studies were similar ; they all found a small eccentricity of the orbit ( @xmath9 ) and semiamplitude @xmath10  km  s@xmath11 .    according to pe01 ,",
    "the signature of a third body is present in the @xmath0 spectra of @xmath5  cir .",
    "here we analyze the spectra from the eso archive .",
    "the third body spectrum is present in these spectra , too .",
    "the mutual orbit of the eclipsing binary and the third body is clearly observed .    in the following ,",
    "we describe the spectroscopic data we used ( sect .",
    "2 ) , how the rvs were measured and exploited for the orbital solutions ( sect .",
    "3 ) , discuss the probable elements of the third body ( sect .",

    "the spectra in the eso archive consist of 2 uves spectra from the years 20002001 , 29 feros spectra from 20072009 , and 95 harps spectra from 20092012 .",
    "we downloaded all harps and most of feros spectra as pipeline products .",
    "we also compiled all available rv measurements from the astronomical literature  km  s@xmath11 for rjd  35252.4 , while @xcite tabulate @xmath12  km  s@xmath11 without any explanation .",
    "we adopted the original feast s et al .",

    "journal of all available rvs is in table  [ jourv ] .",
    "note that throughout this paper we use an abbreviation rjd = hjd@xmath82400000.0 .",
    "we first inspected the existing photographic rvs of the primary component .",
    "several published photographic secondary velocities are probably rather uncertain .",
    "we also used the @xmath0 rvs from pe01 .",
    "there are 41 @xmath0 spectra taken over the course of 17 years .",
    "a large part , 29 of them , was obtained within ten days in september 1992 .",
    "st93 used only spectra from this short interval , and their solution of the primary rv curve has a rms = 2.3  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "pe01 used all @xmath0 spectra together with the h@xmath13 rvs ( they obtained 18 cat / ces spectra at the eso la silla observatory and 3 spectra at the mount stromlo observatory ) and got rms = 8.2  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "they found a third component in the @xmath0 spectra . we will show that the radial velocity of this third body varies ;",
    "already the rms values cited above indicate that the position of the third line must vary , naturally due to the third - body motion around a common centre of gravity with the 3.9  d binary .",
    "such an explanation of the unexpectedly large rms has already been put forward by te .",
    "st93 also noted that their systemic velocity differs from that derived by te and explained the difference by the presence of a third body .",
    "pe01 got different systemic velocities for the iue and h@xmath13 spectra . for the primary rvs",
    ", the difference amounted to 19.6  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "pe01 suggested that this difference might be due to the fact that the corresponding lines were formed in different layers in an expanding stellar atmosphere .",
    "however , we note that their h@xmath13 and iue spectra were obtained in different times , so in view of the results from the eso spectra , the true reason of the difference might well be the orbital motion in the three - body system . in the pe01 solution",
    ", the difference , 19.6  km  s@xmath11 , was added to the h@xmath13 velocities , so we subtracted this value to use the originally measured rvs .",
    "the eso feros and harps spectra were always taken during rather short time intervals , every year from 2007 to 2012 .",

    "but there is also another way how to use the rvs .",
    "the program fotel allows to solve both orbits in a hierarchic system simultaneously , with the advantage that all rvs , not only those in the time - limited groups , can be used .",
    "the solution which includes all old and new rvs is shown in table  4 .",
    "the rvs were weighted by weights inversely proportial to the squares of rms errors of individual datasets .",
    "there is certainly a measurable increase of the longitude of the periastron over the time interval from the @xmath0 spectra to the eso spectra .",
    "however , the value obtained by te disagrees with the trend defined by other sources .",
    "this could , of course , be related to the limited number of photographic rvs available to te and the effects of the motion in the wide orbit .    to verify this suspicion , we split the rvs into two data sets , before rjd  43000 and more recent ones , and derived separate solutions for them modelling both orbits simultaneously .",
