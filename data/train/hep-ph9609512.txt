    "although the standard model ( sm ) of the elementary particle physics is successful in explaining almost all experimental results , it is possible that physics beyond the sm exists just above the presently available energy scale .",
    "since new physics may affect various processes at low energy such as the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes of @xmath11 mesons and @xmath12 mesons , new physics searches in these processes are as important as direct particle searches at collider experiments .",
    "a prime example is the @xmath13 process .",
    "experimentally the inclusive branching ratio is determined as b(@xmath13 ) = @xmath14 at the cleo experiment @xcite .",
    "it is known that this process puts very strong constraints on various new physics beyond the sm , for example two higgs doublet model and supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the sm . along with the @xmath13 process ,",
    "another important rare @xmath15 decay process is the @xmath7 decay .",
    "although only upper bounds on branching ratios are given by experiments for various exclusive modes @xcite , this process is expected to be observed in the near future at @xmath12 factories as well as at hadron machines .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the @xmath7 decay in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , especially in the minimal supergravity ( sugra ) model .",
    "the mssm is now considered to be the most promising candidate beyond the sm . in the mssm , susy partners such as squarks , sleptons , higgsinos and gauginos can contribute to fcnc processes through loop diagrams . in order to evaluate their contributions quantitatively",
    "it is necessary to specify how soft susy breaking terms are generated .",
    "in particular , the soft susy breaking terms in the squark sector become new sources of flavor mixing , and the @xmath16-@xmath17 mixing becomes too large if the squark mixing is @xmath18 and masses of susy partners are in below - tev region @xcite . in the minimal sugra model",
    "it is assumed that the soft susy breaking terms are universal at the planck or gut scale .",
    "flavor mixing at the electroweak scale can be determined by solving the relevant renormalization group equations ( rges ) from the planck to the low energy scale .",
    "it is shown that the constraint from the @xmath16-@xmath17 mixing is easily satisfied in this framework since masses of the first- two - generation squarks with the same quantum numbers remain highly degenerate at the low energy @xcite .",
    "the fcnc processes involving the third generation quarks and squarks can receive sizable susy contributions due to the large top yukawa coupling constant .",
    "in particular the @xmath13 process has been intensively studied both in low energy susy standard models and in the minimal sugra model @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the susy loop effects can interfere with the sm amplitude constructively or destructively depending on the parameters on the model whereas the charged higgs contribution is always constructive . for the minimal sugra model the @xmath19-@xmath20 mixing and cp violating parameter in the @xmath16-@xmath17 mixing , @xmath21 , has been also investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the @xmath7 process in addition to the @xmath13 process to see possible implication on the model by future experiments .",
    "we observe that the predicted branching ratio of the @xmath13 process and that of the @xmath22 process are strongly correlated and thus their measurements are useful to distinguish the sugra model from other extensions of the sm .",
    "the @xmath22 process in the sugra model was analyzed by bertolini _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "recently this process was reconsidered taking account of the measured branching ratio of @xmath13 and the top quark mass in the context of the low - energy susy models as well as the minimal sugra model @xcite . in ref .",

    "@xcite a more detailed analysis has been done in the minimal sugra model .",
    "compared to them , our calculation is improved in several points such as ( 1 ) numerically solving rges with whole yukawa matrices and soft susy breaking parameters with the flavor mixing , ( 2 ) taking account of one - loop corrections in the higgs effective potential @xcite in order to determine the proper vacuum expectation value through the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking scenario @xcite , and ( 3 ) including the interference effect with the long distance contribution in calculating the lepton invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath22 branching ratio .",
    "it turns out that the third effect can change the branching ratio in the off - resonance region by @xmath23% depending on the relative phase between the long and short distance contributions . taking account of various phenomenological constraints including the branching ratio of @xmath2",
    ", we show that there are regions in the parameter space where the branching ratio of @xmath0 is enhanced by about @xmath4% compared to the sm .",

    "this may be achieved before the branching ratio in the off - resonance regions is measured since a large number of events is expected near the resonance regions .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical result of the branching ratio of @xmath24 in the minimal sugra model . for the calculation of this branching ratio ,",
    "we need to introduce a new operator to the effective hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : effective ] , @xmath191 the corresponding wilson coefficient @xmath192 is given in [ sec : ci ] .",
    "note that @xmath192 does not receive qcd correction in lla .",
    "in addition to the sm contribution , there are the @xmath93 penguin and the box diagrams due to the charged higgs boson and susy particles .",
    "since the effect of tau lepton mass in the loop diagram is small , @xmath192 is calculated with 3 massless charged leptons .",
    "important difference from the @xmath22 process is that no photon penguin diagram can contribute to the @xmath24 process .",
    "thus susy contributions to @xmath192 are similar to those to @xmath193 , and no large susy contribution is induced .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath24 is written as @xmath194    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsnunu ] we show the scatter plot of the @xmath24 branching ratio and the chargino mass ( the light stop mass ) . in this calculation",
    "we have taken into account all constraints ( 1)(7 ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we see that the branching ratio does not exceed the sm value and the change is at most @xmath6% .",
    "this result does not depend much on the value of @xmath138 .",
    "in this paper , we have extensively examined the @xmath7 branching ratio in the minimal sugra model . by scanning the three - dimensional space of the soft susy breaking parameters @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath137 for various choices of @xmath138",
    ", we have found that a parameter region , where the wilson coefficient @xmath185 receives a large susy contribution , is still allowed under the lep 1.5 constraints provided that @xmath138 is large . on the other hand ,",
    "the susy contributions to the coefficients @xmath195 and @xmath157 are much smaller than the sm contributions in the whole allowed parameter space .",
    "consequently , there is a strong correlation between the predicted values of the branching ratios of @xmath13 and @xmath22 . applying the measured bound of the @xmath13 branching ratio",
    ", we have shown that the predicted values of the @xmath22 branching ratio are separated in two branches for a large @xmath138 : one corresponds to the region where the sign of the @xmath13 amplitude is the same as that in the sm and the other corresponds to the opposite sign . in the latter case ,",
    "the @xmath22 branching ratio becomes at most @xmath196 larger compared to the sm value .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry is also significantly different from the sm in the same parameter region .",
    "since @xmath197 gev is allowed for such a parameter region , it is possible to observe a large enhancement in the branching ratio of @xmath22 even if no susy particle is found at lep ii .",
    "we also calculated the branching ratio of @xmath24 process and found that it is reduced at most @xmath198 from the sm value .",
    "there are several theoretical ambiguities in the calculation of @xmath22 branching ratio , such as the @xmath199 resonance effect , the renormalization point dependence , the strange quark mass and the higher order corrections in the heavy quark expansion . among them",
    "we studied the renormalization point dependence and the resonance effects in some detail .",
    "the strange quark mass correction , which is of order @xmath200 , is estimated to be less important especially in the low @xmath124 region .",
    "the higher order corrections in the heavy quark expansion is also expected to be small @xcite .",
    "the renormalization point dependence gives about @xmath201 ambiguity to determine the magnitude of @xmath91 from the measured value of @xmath13 branching ratio .",
    "this ambiguity , however , does not affect the correlation between the branching ratios of @xmath13 and @xmath22 much .",
    "we can make a rather definite prediction on the value of the @xmath22 branching ratio with use of the measured @xmath13 branching ratio .",
    "the @xmath199 resonance effect turns out to be important . to deal with this effect ,",
    "we have introduced a phenomenological parameter @xmath123 and have presented our results for @xmath129 since the phase of @xmath123 is not known theoretically .",
    "we have pointed out that there are sizable ambiguities due to this effect for both low and high @xmath124 regions .",
    "this ambiguity will be reduced experimentally if the lepton invariant mass spectrum near the resonances will be measured in some detail .",
    "we have also found that in the low @xmath124 region the change of the @xmath22 branching ratio due to the sign of @xmath185 is larger than the ambiguity induced from the phase of @xmath123 .",
    "this fact enables us to distinguish the sign of @xmath185 without the knowledge of the phase of @xmath123 , by measuring the @xmath22 branching ratio integrated in the low @xmath124 region .",
    "the authors would like to thank k.  hikasa for carefully reading the manuscript and giving useful comments and s.  uno for discussion on the possibility of the experimental measurement on the lepton invariant mass spectrum near the resonance regions .",
