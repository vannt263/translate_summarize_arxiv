    "in light of recent wmap results on reionization @xcite there has been renewed interest in early reionization scenarios @xcite .",
    "the models rely heavily on uv production estimates for the assumed stellar populations and the escape rates depending on the global structure of the luminous proto  galaxies .",
    "the latter is modeled by an escape fraction , f@xmath5 , which is defined as the fraction of ionizing photons produced by stars within a luminous object that exit the object .",
    "initial upper limits of only @xmath6 placed upon escape fractions for local starburst galaxies @xcite raised concerns about the role early galaxies could have had in reionization but these estimates were later revised upward by a factor of four @xcite .",
    "lyman break galaxies may have escape fractions greater than 0.2 @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations usually derive very low escape fractions for even small high redshift galaxies in part because of the assumed scaling of the typical interstellar densities with @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "@xcite in particular do not consider radiation - driven hydrodynamic motion in their static models that could open channels out the galaxy from which uv flux might escape .",
    "a notable exception is the study by @xcite which does model galactic outflows with multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations and finds an appreciably larger escape fraction of @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , there is a clear limit to how far present upper bounds on f@xmath5 can predict the escape of uv photons from pop iii stars because the ionization environment of primordial stars residing in minihalos at z @xmath0 20 is very different from that observed in z @xmath9 0.1 galaxies .",
    "zero - metallicity pop iii stars are not currently thought to have line - driven stellar winds @xcite or exhibit instabilities that can drive significant mass loss on timescales smaller than the main sequence lifetimes of these stars .",
    "consequently , the wind bubbles blown by ob associations in galactic settings which can act to trap uv outflow from these stars @xcite are probably absent around pop iii stars so we do not consider them in our study .",
    "likewise , the primordial halos surrounding the first generation of stars were free of dust that impedes escape of uv photons in modern galaxies .",
    "uv escape fractions and their evolution in current models of early reionization have therefore remained highly uncertain and been treated as a free parameter .    of similar importance in these models",
    "is the efficiency of uv photon production per baryon in stars .",
    "interestingly , different stellar population synthesis models disagree on uv production efficiency , regardless of imf ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "fortunately , high - resolution cdm hydrodynamical simulations now offer robust predictions of the masses and evolution of the first luminous objects that can guide studies of early reionization .",
    "several different techniques have been applied to numerical simulations of the first stars .",
    "the initial studies using nested grid eulerian schemes @xcite revealed that the first cosmological objects condense cool 1000 @xmath10 clouds in their centers . at that time we argued that insufficent spatial resolution and the exclusion of three body formation of molecular hydrogen @xcite left the fate of these large clouds uncertain . similarly medium - resolution smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations @xcite that followed the idealized collapse of uniformly rotating spheres of masses of @xmath11 also found cold clouds of masses @xmath12 to form .",
    "these rotating models first create rotationally - supported disks that eventually fragment .",
    "in contrast , simulations that account for the full hierarchy of structure in cdm models from realistic cosmological conditions produce no disks @xcite , independent of whether smooth particle hydrodynamical or eulerian adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) techniques are employed .",
    "instead , these studies typically find the first protostellar objects to be roughly spherical on scales from @xmath13pc out to the virial radii ( @xmath14pc ) , with masses of approximately 100 @xmath10 accreting within dark matter halos on the order of 10@xmath15 @xmath10 and forming by redshifts of 20 - 30 .",
    "this absence of global disks in the first galaxies and hence around the first luminous objects is crucial to understanding their uv escape fraction and the impact of the first supernova explosions . for a first study of the formation and evolution of the first hii regions , however , it is reasonable to employ only one dimensional radiation  hydrodynamical models .",
    "the highest resolution simulations to date with elements as small as @xmath14 @xmath16 and @xmath17 m@xmath18 @xcite , which also include three - body molecular hydrogen formation , suggest that the primordal molecular cloud analogs do not fragment .",
    "they instead form a single very massive star from the inside out .",
    "the detailed processes limiting the accretion onto these first protostars are not fully understood but @xcite suggested a plausible mass range for the first stars to be between 30 and 300 @xmath10 .",
    "subsequent studies of @xcite assert that the first stars might be as large as 600 @xmath10 , at which point accretion times from @xcite become equal to the lifetime of a primordial massive star .",
    "however , as discussed in detail by @xcite such massive stars would most likely bypass sn explosion to form black holes directly without releasing the heavy elements necessary for the formation of the next generation of lower - mass metal - enriched stars .",
    "omukai & palla further argued that these stars would never achieve photospheric temperatures in excess of 6000 k to contribute uv radiation to the early reionization of the universe .",
    "the models of omukai and palla do not include full hydrodynamics and perhaps more importantly only consider grey radiative transport using mean opacities .",
    "grey transport may fail to capture uv photons in the lyman werner bands of h@xmath19 which even in small numbers will destroy h@xmath19 in the accreting envelope that can not be reformed because of the absence of dust and free electrons .",
    "this method may therefore fail to properly cut off the h@xmath19 cooling that permits accretion to continue , leading to overestimates of protostellar mass .",
    "considering the three - dimensional nature of the accretion , it also seems unlikely that the material would accumulate at the exact rate required to keep the star from reaching the 100,000 k zams temperatures predicted by theory @xcite . however , see @xcite and @xcite for a markedly different view .",
    "we feel that only fully three - dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations that follow radiative transfer without resorting to grey opacities will be able to shed light on the exact physics that presumably halt the accretion of the first protostars .",
    "therefore , given that ab initio numerical simulations yield the detailed structure of the first star - forming clouds and good estimates for the range of expected luminosities of the first stars are available , it is timely to discuss the properties of the associated first hii regions . in this paper we demonstrate that the escape fraction from most microgalaxies holding very massive primordial stars is of order unity .",
    "we make this point with one dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations along with purely analytical arguments . in light of the possible overestimates of final primordial star masses in some current work",
    "we only consider the 120  500 @xmath10 mass range of interest also to future sn metal mixing studies .",
    "collisional and ionization processes can ionize and recombine primordial h and he into h@xmath20 , he@xmath20 , he@xmath21 , h@xmath22 , h@xmath23 , h@xmath24 , and e@xmath22 , which we added to zeus - mp by insertion of a 9species reaction network and nine additional advection equations @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", the calculations we present here assume the primordial gas is hydrogen only , which can be in neutral or ionic form but not molecular .",
    "we discuss the omission of helium later and show that it has a minimal effect on our principal conclusions .",
    "the rate equation for change of neutral hydrogen abundance ( excluding the advection term ) reduces to : @xmath25 we further modified zeus - mp to follow the radiative transfer of a single point source of uv radiation at the center of a spherical - coordinate geometry .",
    "photoionizations in any given cell are due to direct photons from the central source entering the cell s lower face as well as to diffuse photons entering through all its faces .",
    "recombinations within a zone occur to both the ground state and to all the excited states .",
    "the on - the - spot approximation @xcite allows us to equate the diffuse ionizations in a cell to its recombinations to the ground state , relieving us of the costly radiative transfer from many lines of sight needed to compute the diffuse radiation in the cell .",
    "the diffuse ionization and ground - state recombination terms cancel each other in the network above so only a single integration of the transfer equation along a radial ray from the coordinate center is necessary to compute k@xmath26 in a zone .",
    "recognizing that light - crossing times over most of the problem domain are short in comparison to material evolution timescales enables us to discard the time derivative in the equation of transfer that would otherwise restrict the code to unnecessarily short timesteps .",
    "rapid ionizations very close to the central star will violate this approximation and lead to superluminal i  front velocities , which we prevent by computing fluxes only at distances smaller than ct@xmath27 from the star ( see @xcite for discussion ) . in practice ,",
    "the static approximation to the equation of transfer usually becomes valid before the i  front approaches the strmgren radius and the code computes strmgren radii and formation times in excellent agreement with theory .",
    "hence , we solve the static equation of radiative transfer in flux form @xmath28 to produce the central flux piercing the bottom of each cell @xmath29 which yields the photoionization rate coefficient k@xmath26 with units @xmath30 $ ] for the i@xmath31 radial zone : @xmath32 where v@xmath33 and a@xmath34 are the volume and area of the lower face of the cell .",
    "this numerical scheme ensures conservation of photons in all problem zones , a highly - desirable property that ensures i  fronts propagate at speeds that are independent of problem resolution .",
    "we consider only monochromatic radiative transfer , wherein a fixed amount of heat @xmath35 is deposited by the radiation per photoionization .",
    "though not necessary for 1-d studies , this restriction greatly reduces computational cost and will allow full three - dimensional simulations ( whalen _ et  al .  _ in preparation ) .",
    "photoionization , collisional ionization and recombination processes can occur over highly disparate timescales that are all in general much shorter than the hydrodynamic response of the gas .",
    "we finite difference the reaction network in a semi ",
    "implicit scheme which employs densities at the advanced time but rate coefficients evaluated at the current time .",
    "this algorithm bypasses costly matrix iteration that would become prohibitive in 3d while retaining sufficient accuracy to follow i  front propagation .",
    "the code subcycles the reaction network and isochoric energy equation by a tenth of the photoionization timestep @xmath36 until it has covered a tenth of the heating / cooling timestep @xmath37 at which point it updates the hydro equations .",
    "the absence of metals in the first - generation stars and their primordial envelopes permits the use of simple cooling rates in the ischoric energy equation .",
    "only photoionization , recombination , electron collisional ionization and excitation occur in the atomic hydrogen we consider in our calculations , yielding the energy equation : @xmath38 where k@xmath26 is the photoionization rate described above , @xmath35 is the fixed energy per ionization deposited into the gas ( set to 2.4 ev for reasons explained in section 5 ) , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the recombinational and collisional cooling rates taken from @xcite ) .",
    "these four processes act in concert with hydrodynamics ( such as adiabatic expansion or shock heating ) to set the temperature of the gas everywhere in the simulations .",
    "we adopted the benchmarks that franco _ et  al .",
    "_ @xcite employed in their theoretical studies of i  front propagation , in which a source of ionizing photons was centered in a radial density profile with a flat core and an r@xmath42 dropoff : @xmath43 we applied the same initial density profiles , central source strength , and cooling physics in our tests as did franco , _ et  al .",
    "_ their studies of i  front propagation down these radial density gradients indicate there is a critical exponent @xmath44 1.5 below which the front executes the classic approach to a strmgren sphere , reverts from r - type to d - type , and subsequently drives a dense shocked shell before it thereafter down the density gradient @xcite .",
    "the front remains d - type throughout its evolution and accumulates mass in its shell for as long as it expands .",
    "fig 1 compares zeus - mp s propagation of a d - type i  front down an r@xmath3 density gradient to the predicted analytical result .",
    "the code results agree with theory to within 7% at early times and 3% at later times .",
    "we expect slightly greater disagreement at early times because no current theory addresses the hydrodynamic details of the r- to d - transition but becomes increasingly accurate as the i  front evolves .",
    "the shock front can be seen to precede the i  front with the analytical result ( which assumes the shock and front positions essentially coincide ) falling between them .",
    "ionization fronts descending density gradients steeper than the critical @xmath45 1.5 rapidly revert from d - type back to r - type ( in some cases never having switched from r - type in the first place ) and quickly overrun the cloud .",
    "now completely ionized and at much higher pressures , the entire cloud inflates outward at the sound speed of the ionized material , typically on the order of 10 km s@xmath3 . in this scenario strong core density gradients in the now mostly - isothermal cloud become strong pressure gradients which drive a shock that pistons the already - moving cloud material outward in a champagne flow .",
    "the shocked core expands at nearly constant velocities down 1.5 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath46 3 gradients but strongly accelerates out through @xmath47 @xmath48 3 gradients .",
    "runs conducted with zeus - mp for 1.5 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath46 5 demonstrate this behavior . fig 1 compares zeus - mp s expansion of the ionized core to the core expansion rates of the @xcite theory , demonstrating agreement to within 10% at early times and 2% at later times .",
    "we show in fig 2 the fit we computed to the spherically - averaged gas number density surrounding the primordial protostar of the very high dynamical range amr calculation performed by @xcite . in that calculation",
    "the protostellar core accreted within a 7 @xmath49 10@xmath50 m@xmath51 dark matter halo by a redshift of 18.2 . at r @xmath0 175 pc",
    "we smoothly joined this fit to a constant baryon number density of 0.02 cm@xmath3 , which is roughly 10 times the cosmic mean at this redshift , to approximate the higher circum - halo density found in @xcite . in table 2",
    "we list final i - front radii assuming a circum - halo density equal to the cosmic mean .",
    "the spherical averaging of the baryonic density removes clumping and other features whose effects will be studied when we extend these simulations to 3-d in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the density was assigned a uniform temperature of 300 k ( typical of the virialized baryonic matter cooled by molecular hydrogen in the @xcite simulations ) and made static by applying the gravitational potential necessary to hold it in hydrostatic equilibrium ( this potential would be that exerted by the dark matter halo were it explicitly present in our simulation ) .",
    "we evolved this model without a central ionizing source to make certain the gas is in sufficiently stable equilibrium and found peculiar velocities to be less than 0.1 @xmath53 after the three million years typical for lifetimes of very massive primordial stars . the gravitational potential was held constant throughout the evolution of the problem because the exit of the gas from the halo should have minimal impact on the more massive equilibrium dark matter halo left behind . for the results presented below we used 142 logarithmically - spaced radial zones .",
    "we placed a series of constant ionizing luminosities shown in table 1 corresponding to a range of stellar masses and main - sequence lifetimes @xcite at the center of the distribution ( the 120 m@xmath51 star was what emerged from the @xcite calculations ) .

    "+      an interesting question is whether a sufficiently massive halo is capable of trapping the hii region .",
    "the escape velocity has no direct effect on escape fraction because the fraction depends only on the reversion of the front back to r - type , not on whether any gas exits the halo .",
    "this transition will occur in any halo whose baryonic density drops off more steeply than r@xmath54 , whether or not there is outflow from the halo ( the abel , et al densities as well as more recent @xmath55cdm profiles all decrease approximately as r@xmath56 ) .    however , core densities could be sufficiently high in massive halos to prevent this transition from occurring before the main sequence lifetime of the central source , in which case the front would be trapped as an ultracompact ( uc ) hii region @xcite .",
    "we tested three halo mass profiles with a 200 m@xmath18 star by scaling the original density profile of @xcite by factors of 2 and 5 ( n(r/2 ) and n(r/5 ) ) .",
    "the most massive halo confined the i  front to a 0.1 pc uc hii region while the n(r/2 ) halo permitted the front to escape , as seen clearly in figs 7 and 8 .",
    "the front has slightly higher temperatures in the greater n(r/2 ) density and thus develops higher shock speeds .",
    "however , the delay in the d- to r - type transition keeps the core shock from reaching the same radius as in the original distribution .",
    "the high central densities of the most massive halo prevent the reversion of the i - front from d - type to r - type before the star exits the main sequence . only in this",
    "unrealistically limiting case does no uv ( or therefore gas ) escape the halo .",
    "breakout occurs in the other two cases although it occurs later in the more massive of the two halos so less mass is ejected from it .",
    "the final i - sphere radius of the n(r/2 ) halo is also smaller than the n(r ) i - sphere because the n(r/2 ) halo exhibits its high f@xmath5 for less time . until the relationship between the mass of a minihalo and the central star that may accrete within it is better understood it will not be possible to make a precise determination of how many pop iii i - fronts achieve breakout , only that the majority of them do for a reasonable scaling of halo densities with stellar mass .",
    "realistic escape fractions from the first luminous objects are close to unity because the halos become nearly transparent to uv photons when ionized by the r - type front .",
    "this result is of particular importance because recent determinations of the electron - scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background radiation since recombination suggest an early period of reionization @xcite .",
    "the very massive stars ( 30 m@xmath51 @xmath9 m@xmath57 @xmath9 300 m@xmath51 ) emerging in recent numerical simulations in concert with large uv escape fractions may likely be large contributors to early reionization .",
    "the photoevaporative flows of the first stars will leave dark halos with low gas content regardless of whether these stars die in bright supernovae or form black holes ( e.g. @xcite , for an extended discussion ) . since the typical expansion velocities of the flows we find are much larger than the halo escape velocity one can not expect the gas to return within timescales in which the halo would merge again into larger objects .",
    "black hole remnants of the first stars that created the hii region could not accrete significant mass in the low density environment their progenitors have created .",
    "this fact may be an important constraint for theories of supermassive black hole formation relying on constant feeding of stellar black hole remnants ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the hii region that evacuates the halo will also enhance metal enrichment of the halo and interhalo medium by the first supernova .",
    "a 200 m@xmath51 pair - instability supernova remnant initially expands into an ambient density that is only twice the interhalo mean .",
    "fig 5 shows this ejecta must travel 10 pc before encountering its own mass in halo material , before which it would be in a free - expansion state .",
    "the remnant will not enter a sedov - taylor phase until it is at least 50 pc in radius , at which point rayleigh - taylor instabilities that we can not simulate in 1d begin to mix the ejected metals with the gas in the halo .",
    "how these instabilities promote metal pollution of the early igm will be the focus of future study .",
    "only three dimensional models of the first hii regions will allow us to address the detailed questions recently raised by @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for suggestions that significantly improved the quality of this manuscript .",
