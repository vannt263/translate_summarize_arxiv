    "the idea that string theory , with its fundamental length scale , could resolve the big bang singularity by effectively limiting space - time curvature has led , during the last decade , to a variety of models @xcite where the big bang represents a turning ( rather than an end)-point in the history of the early universe .",
    "all these models share the property of exhibiting a bounce in curvature , since the pre ( resp .",
    "post)-bang eras are characterized by growing ( resp . decreasing ) space - time curvature .",
    "hereafter we shall refer to this generic class of models as pre - big bang ( pbb ) cosmologies .",
    "technically speaking , the pbb phase can replace the inflationary phase of standard slow - roll inflation since it allows the cosmologically interesting scales we observe today to start well inside the hubble radius , and thus to have time to homogenize through causal microphysics .",
    "an advantage of pbb cosmologies @xcite is that they are less sensitive to the so - called trans - planckian problem since the proper frequency of all relevant quantum fluctuation starts very much below the planck ( but not necessarily the string ) scale ; the opposite is true in the case of slow - roll inflation , where all relevant proper frequencies are initially much above the planck scale , formally causing linear perturbation theory to break down .",
    "another difference is that , while in ordinary inflationary models string ( or planck)-scale physics is washed out by inflation ( except for the above - mentioned possible imprint on initial conditions ) , the opposite is the case in pbb cosmologies since the high - curvature phase , the bounce , comes there _ at the end _ of inflation .",
    "if this latter property of pbb cosmology is appealing in that it opens an observational window on short - distance physics it also makes it mandatory to understand how the bounce itself may ( or may not ) affect different observables . unfortunately , this is not an easy problem to solve since the details of the poorly understood mechanism responsible for the curvature bounce may affect , in a crucial way , how different perturbations behave across the bounce itself . as an example , while the original investigations @xcite argued in favour of a strongly tilted ( blue ) spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations , more recently arguments have been given @xcite for much flatter ( and possibly even scale - invariant ) spectra . in toy models where the bounce is schematized as a discontinuity across a space - like hypersurface",
    "those different predictions can be shown @xcite to correspond to different ways of implementing israel s junction conditions .",
    "this has led to much debate in the literature lately ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to use , as a theoretical laboratory , a model of background which is everywhere smooth and regular , so that we can follow both analytically and numerically the evolution of the different fluctuations throughout .",
    "one can then replace the smooth evolution by a sudden transition , and check how different prescriptions match with the  exact \" results .",
    "we will work , in particular , in the context of a perturbative approach based on the string effective action , where it is known that curvature singularities can be eliminated either at large curvature / coupling by a combination of higher - derivative and loop corrections @xcite or , in the low - curvature regime , by the contribution of a non - local dilaton potential @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on this second possibility , and we will consider regular cosmological models obtained by using a non - local potential put in by hand . such a potential may arise , however , from dilatonic loop corrections in manifolds with compact spatial sections .",
    "the corresponding non - local potential energy provides a dominant correction to the regularization of the background when an effective dimensionally - reduced coupling grows large , and leads to bouncing solutions smoothly evolving ( in the einstein frame ) from accelerated contraction to decelerated expansion .",
    "this paper extends the results of a previous letter @xcite by investigating the frame - independence of the results , by performing the above - mentioned comparison with different matching conditions , and by including a perfect fluid source both in the background and the perturbation equations .",
    "however , we shall limit our detailed discussion of scalar perturbations to a particular example of gravi - dilaton background without matter sources .",
    "the discussion of more general examples is postponed to further work @xcite .",
    "our analytical and numerical computations suggests that the scalar spectrum associated to a non - singular background can be correctly obtained through an ( approximate ) matching procedure , _ provided _ the matching prescriptions are such as to guarantee a smooth crossing over the bounce of the variable @xmath6 , representing spatial curvature perturbations on comoving ( or , at large scale , on constant energy density ) hypersurfaces , and _ not _ of the variable @xmath7 , the gauge invariant bardeeen potential .",
    "it is possible , however , that such a result is due to the fact that the bounce is triggered by a potential @xmath8 that depends mostly on the value of the dilaton : as such , it may not apply when the matching is performed through a _ singular _ bounce , as it seems to be the case in the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the low - energy effective action to be used throughout this paper and discuss , in particular , the possible origin of the non - local dilaton potential . in section",
    "iii we derive , both in the string and in the einstein frame , the ( non - local ) field equations that follow from the above action , and present classes of exact solutions describing regular homogeneous bouncing backgrounds .",
    "the last part of section iii , containing the derivation of the exact solutions with fluid sources , is not essential for the understanding of the subsequent sections , and may be skipped by those readers who are only interested in the discussion of the matching prescriptions . in section",
    "iv we introduce the full set of scalar perturbation equations in the einstein frame , including the perturbations of the fluid sources , both in the uniform - dilaton gauge and in full gauge - invariant form .",
    "we also give explicit relations to the string - frame perturbation variables , for easier comparison with previous papers and results .",
    "in section v we estimate analytically , and compute numerically , the scalar perturbation spectrum ( inside and outside the horizon ) for a typical example of regularized background , and we discuss the possibility of reproducing the same spectrum through an appropriate matching procedure across a sudden bounce .",
    "section vi is devoted to some general comments and concluding remarks .",
    "it is well known that implementing a curvature bounce in cosmology must involve some unconventional equation of state for the dominant source of energy .",
    "such a possibility can arise in principle from higher - order corrections in @xmath9 , string - loop corrections , or both .",
    "examples of such  exit \" mechanisms have been widely discussed in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we wish to implement a low - curvature bounce and therefore we will not appeal to the former kind of corrections .",
    "we shall argue , instead , that string - loop corrections , in the presence of space compactification , can provide an efficient and appealing regularization mechanism .    in a @xmath10-dimensional manifold ,",
    "if @xmath11 spatial dimensions are compactified , at energies below the compactification scale the effective lower - dimensional dynamics is controlled indeed by the  reduced \" coupling : g_red^2 = g_s^2/ v_n , [ gred ] where @xmath12 is the string coupling of the full @xmath10-dimensional theory ( @xmath13 being the dilaton ) and @xmath14 is the @xmath15-dimensonal compactification volume in string units . in standard superstring compactifications from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ,",
    "the reduced coupling @xmath18 is nothing but the four - dimensional gauge coupling that controls the dynamics of the  zero - modes \" with respect to the six - dimensional internal space , i.e. of the light four - dimensional degrees of freedom . as an example",
    ", it is known that the running of @xmath19 is determined by @xmath19 itself through the infrared behaviour of zero - mode loops .",
    "it is also known that @xmath0-duality ( i.e. large - small volume duality ) is preserved by loops , provided the reduced coupling is kept fixed .    in a cosmological set - up where the whole of space is compact , the zero modes become the homogeneous components of the various fields , and their self - interactions",
    "should be controlled by the @xmath20 effective coupling @xmath21 . in analogy with the previous example we may expect loop - corrections that preserve @xmath0-duality where ,",
    "this time , @xmath22 is kept fixed . in particular ,",
    "if a non - trivial effective potential is induced , it should satisfy such a symmetry and must therefore be of the form @xmath23 .",
    "it is known @xcite that such potentials can be very useful for inducing curvature bounces .",
    "however , for a long time , it was not clear how to formulate such a framework in a fully general - covariant way .",
    "this problem was solved in @xcite , where the following generalization of @xmath24 to a function of all the coordinates @xmath25 was proposed ( @xmath26 ) : e^-(x ) = 1^d   e^-(y )  ( ( x ) - ( y ) ) . [",
    "21 ] such a quantity , even if non - local , transforms as a scalar function of @xmath25 under general coordinate transformations , and is automatically @xmath27 invariant for a string - frame ( s - frame ) metric with @xmath28 abelian isometries .",
    "it should be remarked , however , that such a definition of @xmath29 is only consistent for backgrounds such that @xmath30 .",
    "this will be always the case for all background solutions we will consider in this paper .    in the spirit of the previous discussion",
    ", our toy model will consist of taking the tree - level , low - energy effective action of ( say heterotic ) string theory , and of adding to it a suitable effective potential depending only upon @xmath31 , while other possible matter fields are included into the effective action @xmath32 .",
