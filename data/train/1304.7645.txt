    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) were introduced by mller _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , ji @xcite and radyushkin @xcite .",
    "they encode a wealth of information about the structure of the nucleon including 3d imaging of its partonic content and access to the quark orbital angular momentum .",
    "gpds have been the object of an intense theoretical and experimental activity ever since ( see the reviews ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "gpds can be accessed experimentally by studying the processes of leptoproduction of a photon : deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) ( gpds can also be accessed through its timelike counterpart : timelike compton scattering @xcite ) , or a meson : deeply virtual meson production ( dvmp ) .",
    "the dvcs amplitude is expressed in terms of compton form factors ( cffs ) , which are convolutions of gpds with known kernels .",
    "cffs were extracted from dvcs in ref .",
    "@xcite while gpds were constrained from dvcs in ref .",
    "@xcite or from dvmp in ref .",
    "note that this last set of gpds , tuned for dvmp analysis , has been compared recently to almost all existing dvcs measurements @xcite .",
    "although these results are promising , our knowledge of gpds is far from complete and will certainly be challenged by forthcoming measurements at compass , by the high precision data expected after the jefferson lab 12   upgrade and at an electron ion collider .",
    "gaining an experimental knowledge of gpds is more involved than extracting parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) from measurements : there are more gpds than pdfs , and they depend on three variables instead of one .",
    "gpds are subject to several theoretical constraints , and are related to pdfs and quark contributions to nucleon form factors ( ffs ) .",
    "there is no known parameterization of gpds relying only on qcd first principles .",
    "part of the theoretical constraints on gpds are fulfilled by modeling double distributions ( dds ) @xcite , which are related to gpds by a radon transform @xcite .",
    "dd modeling is the most popular way to build simple and realistic gpd models , and has been widely used so far , for example in the popular vgg ( vanderhaeghen , guichon and guidal ) @xcite or gk ( goloskokov and kroll ) @xcite models .",
    "however these models are not in agreement with all existing dvcs data , as one can see from fit results for vgg @xcite or in the systematic application of the gk model to dvcs data in ref .",
    "@xcite . to reach a better comparison to the data",
    "one may either turn to more sophisticated gpd parameterizations , for example as advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , or try different implementations of dd modeling .",
    "the latter direction recently benefited from renewed interest when radyushkin exhibited a gpd model @xcite built on the so - called _ one - component dds _",
    "representation @xcite .",
    "this representation was first outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite but was not used for phenomenology so far : its implementation was an open problem since it leads to a more divergent behavior of the gpds at small longitudinal momentum fractions than the one described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we implement the one - component dd formalism along the lines described in ref .",
    "@xcite for pdfs with an integrable singularity at the origin , and confront it to dvcs experimental data .",
    "we will compare our model to jefferson lab hall  a @xcite and clas measurements @xcite which are very accurate and concern the valence sector .",
    "therefore we only implemented the one - component dd model for the singlet contribution of valence quarks .",
    "since the partonic interpretation of dvcs observables relies on factorization theorems , we will apply the further restriction @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the momentum transfer , and @xmath3 the incoming photon virtuality @xcite .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite was done in the case of a spinless target although it was illustrated by a nucleon valence pdf - like toy model .",
    "the analog of the gpd @xmath4 in the spinless case is an admixture of the gpds @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , beam polarized dvcs observables involving unpolarized targets are mostly independent of the gpd @xmath7 .",
    "this allows us to use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite without any further adaptation to the spin-1/2 case in this first study .    in the first section",
    "we remind the basics of gpd modeling based on dds . in the second section",
    "we modify accordingly the valence part of the dd model used in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the third section we discuss the phenomenological consequences of this alternative dd ansatz . in the fourth section",
    "we discuss the model for nucleon gpds relying on both 1cdd and 2cdd formalisms recently advocated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for any four - vector @xmath8 we note : @xmath9 @xmath10 denotes the scalar product of two four - vectors @xmath11 and @xmath8 .      for the sake of clarity ,",
    "we discuss in this section the case of gpds and dds of spinless hadrons .",

    "@xmath23 is the rhombus defined by : @xmath24    assuming the vanishing of dds on the boundary of the rhombus and @xmath25 of the support @xmath23 .",

    "the coefficient @xmath51 guarantees the normalization of the profile function : @xmath52 from a matter of principles , the fdda can be applied to a @xmath26-type dd in the 1cdd and 2cdd formalisms as well .",

    "a natural question is : can the agreement be improved in the valence region by switching from the 2cdd to the 1cdd formalism ?",

    "we compared these two representations to existing data . to keep the exercise simple , we worked with beam - helicity dependent observables in the valence region . as a first approximation",
    ", we choose to work at leading order , to take into account only the quark gpds @xmath0 and @xmath7 , and to modify only their valence part .",
    "we also neglect gpd evolution and higher twist effects .",
    "such a detailed treatment is beyond the scope of this paper , which simply aims at comparing the pros and cons of two dd representations .    to illustrate the two - component dd representations ( spin-0 and spin-1/2 cases ) we used the goloskokov  -  kroll model .",
    "we built our one - component dd models by modifying the valence parts of @xmath0 and @xmath7 and leaving the rest unchanged .",
    "interestingly , for a given gpd , all models have the same unskewed limits when the profile function widths decrease to produce a single peak .",
    "this shows a natural limit of dd models and gives a hint about the flexibility of the associated dd representations .",
    "since both one and two - component dd representations have the same limit when distorting the profile function , the one - component dd framework can produce similar results to the two - component dd representation .",
    "the classical two - component dd is almost insensitive to the width of the profile function , while the one - component dd displays important variations when using a spin-0 ansatz .",
    "the conclusion is less clear when using a spin-1/2 modeling , which mixes @xmath0 and @xmath7 in the dd and one - component dd representations , probably because the @xmath7-dependent part of the model is not really constrained by the selected measurement sets . in that respect",
    "it would be interesting to carefully examine the constraints on @xmath7 brought by the form factor @xmath116 in the spirit of the extensive study ref .",
    "this point is left for future work .",
    "the one - component dd has hardly been used so far in phenomenological applications because of its more singular behavior for small longitudinal momentum fractions .",
    "but since radyushkin s treatment of divergences @xcite in the one - component dd representation , the implementation of the one - component dd and two - component dd frameworks have the same complexity , at last when the gpd forward limits have integrable singularities : the same kind of integrals have to be dealt with .    for these two reasons ( flexibility and implementation complexity )",
    "we consider the use of the one - component dd representation and its implementation along the lines described in ref .",
    "@xcite as an interesting alternative to the earlier approach of ref .",
    "these features allow to build flexible ands realistic gpd models for sensitivity studies , for example to compute the typical size of higher - order corrections in some channels in the spirit of ref",
    ".  @xcite .    in this study gpds",
    "were modified only in the valence region .",
