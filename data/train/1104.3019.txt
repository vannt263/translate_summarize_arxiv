    "we consider the well - known fitzhugh  nagumo model in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the membrane potential , @xmath2 is a recovery variable , and @xmath3 is the magnitude of stimulus current , which is a two - dimensional simplification of the classical hodgkin  huxley model of the spike dynamics in a biological neuron @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this system was suggested by fitzhugh ( 1961 ) @xcite , who called it `` bonhoeffer  van der pol model '' , and the equivalent circuit was constructed by nagumo et al .",
    "( 1962 ) @xcite . the motivation for the fitzhugh  nagumo model was to isolate conceptually the essentially mathematical properties of excitation and propagation from the electrochemical properties of sodium and potassium ion flow .",
    "the model consists of a voltage - like variable having cubic nonlinearity that allows regenerative self - excitation via a positive feedback , and a recovery variable having a linear dynamics that provides a slower negative feedback . while the hodgkin  huxley model is more realistic and biophysically sound , only projections of its four - dimensional phase trajectories",
    "can be observed .",
    "the simplicity of the fitzhugh  nagumo model permits the entire solution to be viewed at once .",
    "this allows a geometrical explanation of important biological phenomena related to neuronal excitability and spike - generating mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the phase portrait of the fitzhugh  nagumo model ( 1.1 ) depicts the @xmath1-nullcline , which is the @xmath4-shaped curve obtained from the condition @xmath5 and the @xmath2-nullcline , which is a straight line obtained from the condition @xmath6 the intersection of nullclines is an equilibrium ( a singular point ) of the system ( 1.1 ) , which may be unstable if it is on the middle branch of the @xmath1-nullcline , i.e. , when @xmath3 is strong enough . in this case , the model exhibits periodic ( tonic spiking ) activity .",
    "the fitzhugh  nagumo model explained the absence of all - or - none spikes in the hodgkin ",
    "huxley model in response to stimuli , i.e. , pulses of the injected current @xmath7 weak stimuli ( small pulses of @xmath8 result in small - amplitude trajectories that correspond to subthreshold responses ; stronger stimuli result in intermediate - amplitude trajectories that correspond to partial - amplitude spikes ; and strong stimuli result in large - amplitude trajectories that correspond to suprathreshold response  firing a spike .    similarly to the hodgkin ",
    "huxley model , the fitzhugh  nagumo model does not have a well - defined firing threshold in the absence of a saddle equilibrium .",
    "this feature is the consequence of the absence of all - or - none responses .",
    "the apparent illusion of threshold dynamics and all - or - none responses in both models is due to the existence of the `` quasi - threshold '' , which is a canard trajectory that follows the unstable ( middle ) branch of the @xmath4-shaped @xmath1-nullcline .",
    "the fitzhugh  nagumo model explains the excitation block phenomenon , i.e. , the cessation of repetitive spiking as the amplitude of the stimulus current increases .",
    "when @xmath3 is weak or zero , the equilibrium ( intersection of nullclines ) is on the left ( stable ) branch of @xmath1-nullcline , and the model is resting .",
    "increasing @xmath3 shifts the nullcline upward and the equilibrium slides onto the middle ( unstable ) branch of the nullcline .",
    "the model exhibits periodic spiking activity in this case . increasing the stimulus",
    "further shifts the equilibrium to the right ( stable ) branch of the @xmath4-shaped nullcline , and the oscillations are blocked ( by excitation ) .",
    "the precise mathematical mechanism involves appearance and disappearance of a limit cycle attractor , and it is reviewed in detail by izhikevich ( 2007 ) @xcite .",
    "this model explained also the phenomenon of post - inhibitory ( rebound ) spikes , called anodal break excitation at that time .",
    "as the stimulus @xmath3 becomes negative ( hyperpolarization ) , the resting state shifts to the left .",
    "as the system is released from hyperpolarization ( anodal break ) , the trajectory starts from a point far below the resting state ( outside the quasi - threshold ) , makes a large - amplitude excursion , i.e. , fires a transient spike , and then returns to the resting state .",
    "the fitzhugh  nagumo model explained the dynamical mechanism of spike accommodation in hodgkin  huxley - type models .",
    "when stimulation strength increases slowly , the neuron remains quiescent .",
    "the resting equilibrium of ( 1.1 ) shifts slowly to the right , and the state of the system follows it smoothly without firing spikes .",
    "in contrast , when the stimulation is increased abruptly , even by a smaller amount , the trajectory could not go directly to the new resting state , but fires a transient spike ; see figure .",
    "geometrically , this phenomenon is similar to the post - inhibitory ( rebound ) response .",
    "the fitzhugh  nagumo equations became a favorite model for reaction - diffusion systems @xmath9 which simulate propagation of waves in excitable media , such as heart tissue or nerve fiber . here",
    ", the diffusion term @xmath10 is the second derivative with respect to the spatial variable @xmath11 its success is mostly due to the fact that the model is analytically tractable , and hence it allows derivation of many important properties of traveling pulses without resort to computer simulations .    without loss of generality , the system ( 1.1 ) can be written in the canonical form @xmath12 such a system was studied earlier , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "however , its qualitative analysis was incomplete , since the global bifurcations of multiple limit cycles could not be studied properly by means of the methods and techniques which were used earlier in the qualitative theory of dynamical systems . applying new bifurcation methods and geometric approaches developed in @xcite , @xcite@xcite , we complete the qualitative analysis of the fitzhugh  nagumo model and prove , in particular , that the corresponding dynamical system ( 1.3 ) has at most two limit cycles . in sections  24 of this paper , we recall basic facts and results from the global bifurcation theory of polynomial dynamical systems and its applications .",
    "these results , together with the methods of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite , are used in sections  5 ,  6 for the study of singular point and limit cycle bifurcations of the system  ( 1.3 ) .",
    "in this paper , geometric aspects of bifurcation and catastrophe theories are used and developed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "first of all , the two - isocline method which was developed by erugin is used , see @xcite .",
    "an isocline portrait is the most natural construction for a polynomial equation .",
    "it is sufficient to have only two nullclines ( or isoclines of zero and infinity in our terminology ) to obtain principal information on the original polynomial system , because these two isoclines are right - hand sides of the system .",
    "geometric properties of isoclines ( conics , cubics , quartics , etc . ) are well - known , and all isocline portraits can be easily constructed . by means of them , all topologically different qualitative pictures of integral curves to within a number of limit cycles and distinguishing center and focus can be obtained .",
    "thus , it is possible to carry out a rough topological classification of the phase portraits for the polynomial dynamical systems .",
    "it is the first application of erugin s method . after studying contact and rotation properties of the isoclines ,",
    "the simplest ( canonical ) systems containing limit cycles can be also constructed .",
    "two groups of parameters can be distinguished in such systems : static and dynamic .",
    "static parameters determine the behavior of phase trajectories in principle , since they control the number , position , and character of singular points in a finite part of the plane ( finite singularities ) .",
    "the parameters from the first group determine also a possible behavior of separatrices and singular points at infinity ( infinite singularities ) under variation of the parameters from the second group .",
    "the dynamic parameters are field rotation parameters , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they do not change the number , position and index of the finite singularities , but only involve the vector field in a directional rotation .",
    "the rotation parameters allow to control the infinite singularities , the behavior of limit cycles and separatrices .",
    "the cyclicity of singular points and separatrix cycles , the behavior of semi - stable and other multiple limit cycles are controlled by these parameters as well .",
    "therefore , by means of the rotation parameters , it is possible to control all limit cycle bifurcations and to solve the most complicated problems of the qualitative theory of dynamical systems .    in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "some complete results on quadratic systems have been presented . in particular",
    ", it has been proved that for quadratic systems four is really the maximum number of limit cycles and @xmath13 i.e. , three limit cycles around one focus and the only limit cycle around another focus , is their only possible distribution ( this is a solution of hilbert s sixteenth problem in the quadratic case of polynomial dynamical systems ) . in @xcite , some preliminary results on generalizing new ideas and methods of @xcite to cubic dynamical systems have already been established . in particular , a canonical cubic system of kukles type has been constructed and the global qualitative analysis of its special case corresponding to a generalized linard equation has been carried out .",
    "it has been proved also that the foci of such a linard system can be at most of second order and that such system can have at most three limit cycles on the whole phase plane . moreover , unlike all previous works on the kukles - type systems , global bifurcations of limit and separatrix cycles using arbitrary ( including as large as possible ) field rotation parameters of the canonical system have been studied in @xcite . as a result , the classification of all possible types of separatrix cycles for the generalized linard system has been obtained and all possible distributions of its limit cycles have been found . in @xcite , @xcite , a solution of smale s thirteenth problem proving that the linard system with a polynomial of degree @xmath14 can have at most @xmath15 limit cycles has been presented . in @xcite , we have completed the global qualitative analysis of a quartic ecological model .",
    "all of these methods and results can be applied to the global qualitative analysis of the fitzhugh  nagumo neuronal model as  well .    in @xcite",
    ", we have already carried out the global qualitative analysis of a polynomial dynamical system as a learning model of neural networks @xcite , @xcite .",
    "learning models are algorithms , implementable as neural networks , that aim to mimic an adaptive procedure .",
    "a  neural network is a device consisting on interconnected processing units , designated neurons .",
    "an input presented to the network is translated as a numerical assignment to each neuron .",
    "this will create a sequence of internal adjustments leading to a learning process .",
    "an input vector , denoted by @xmath16 represents an @xmath17-dimensional random vector with independent components .",
    "this means that the joint probability distribution function is the product of @xmath17 density functions .",
    "the output value , denoted by  @xmath18 is the outcome of the network s action on @xmath19 and is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the connecting weight for the synapse attached to the input neuron @xmath22 since new synapses may be created under a constant error rate , @xmath23 a synaptic strength may capture nearby activity .",
    "this is done by the creation of temporary synapses from the closest neurons to the output one .",
    "the synaptic rate of change is given by @xmath24 for @xmath25 or @xmath26 for @xmath27 or @xmath28 respectively .",
    "substituting the value of @xmath1 in the expression of @xmath29 we obtain @xmath30      ( 1\\!-\\!e)\\sum_{j=1}^n \\omega_j \\xi_j \\xi_i+(e/2)\\sum_{j=1}^n      \\omega_j\\xi_j\\xi_{i\\pm1}\\!-\\sum_{j,\\,k}\\omega_j\\omega_k\\xi_j\\xi_k\\omega_i,\\\\      i=1~\\mbox{or}~n ,      \\end{array }      \\right.\\ ] ] what can be reduced to the equation @xmath31 with @xmath32_{ij}=\\xi^t\\xi,$ ] @xmath33 a correlation matrix of expected values , and @xmath34 a  tridiagonal substochastic matrix given by @xmath35 if @xmath36 @xmath37 if @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for all @xmath40 and @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "desirable initial conditions are those with trajectories that converge to some equilibrium ( singular ) point of  ( 2.1 ) .",
    "this will assume a natural weight assignment as a result of the learning process .",
    "knowledge on the stability of equilibria provides information on the robustness of the learning process .",
    "existence of cycles might represent a different kind of learning where a whole continuum of connecting weight vectors emerges instead of just a single vector . in @xcite , we have restricted our attention to two dimensions .    for two input neurons , ( 2.1 ) can be written as a cubic dynamical system @xmath42   \\dot{y}=((\\varepsilon/2)a\\!+\\!(1\\!-\\!\\varepsilon)b)x\\!+\\!((\\varepsilon/2)b\\!+   \\!(1\\!-\\!\\varepsilon)c)y - y(ax^2\\!+\\!2bxy\\!+\\!cy^2 ) ,      \\end{array }      \\eqno(2.2)\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 represent , respectively , the probability of synaptic formation and the weight strengths for the synapses attached to the input neurons  @xcite .",
    "thus , we have got a four - parameter planar dynamical system for investigation . applying techniques based both on classical poincar and dulac methods and also on some methods developed in  @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the global bifurcations of singular points and limit cycles of the cubic system  ( 2.2 ) , a learning model of planar neural networks  @xcite .    some of these techniques can be extended to higher - dimensional dynamical systems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so , for the global analysis of limit cycle bifurcations ( in particular , for solving the uniqueness problem ) we have used the perko planar termination principle stating that the maximal one - parameter family of multiple limit cycles terminates either at a singular point , which is typically of the same multiplicity , or on a separatrix cycle , which is also typically of the same multiplicity @xcite .",
    "this principle is a consequence of the wintner principle of natural termination , which was stated for higher - dimensional dynamical systems ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , where one - parameter families of periodic orbits of the restricted three - body problem are studied and puiseux series are used to show that in the analytic case any one - parameter family of periodic orbits can be uniquely continued through any bifurcation except a period - doubling bifurcation .",
    "thus , the wintner  perko termination principle and the method developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite can be applied to the further global qualitative analysis of neural dynamical systems .",
