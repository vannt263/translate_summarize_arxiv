    "they act on @xmath18 s symmetric space , the hyperbolic three - space @xmath19 .",
    "interest in this action first arose when felix klein and henri poincar studied certain groups of mbius transformations with complex coefficients @xcite , laying the groundwork for the study of _ kleinian groups_. the latter are nowadays defined as discrete subgroups of @xmath18 .",
    "each non - cocompact arithmetic kleinian group is commensurable with some bianchi group @xcite .",
    "thus , the bianchi groups play a key role in the study of arithmetic kleinian groups . a wealth of information on the bianchi groups",
    "can be found in the pertinent monographs @xcite .",
    "+ poincar gave an explicit formula for their action on @xmath19 .",
    "however , the virtual cohomological dimension of arithmetic groups which are lattices in @xmath20 is two , so it is desirable to restrict this proper action on @xmath19 to a contractible cellular two - dimensional space .",
    "moreover , this space should be cofinite . in principle , this has been achieved by mendoza @xcite and also by flge @xcite , using reduction theory of minkowski , humbert , harder and others .",
    "their two approaches have in common that they consider two - dimensional retracts which are cocompact and are endowed with a natural cw - structure such that the action of @xmath11 is cellular and the quotient is a finite cw - complex . + using mendoza s complex , schwermer and vogtmann @xcite calculated the integral group homology in the cases of trivial class group @xmath21 , and vogtmann @xcite computed the rational homology as the homology of the quotient space in many cases of non - trivial class group .",
    "the integral cohomology in the cases @xmath22 has been determined by berkove @xcite , based on flge s presentation of the groups with generators and relations . a completely different method to obtain group presentations",
    "has been chosen by yasaki  @xcite , who has implemented an algorithm of gunnells  @xcite to compute the perfect forms modulo the action of @xmath23 and obtain the facets of the vorono polyhedron arising from a construction of ash  @xcite .",

    "we consider an analogous equivariant retraction of @xmath32 such that its retract @xmath33 contains the singular points .",
    "now it turns out that the quotient space of @xmath33 by @xmath11 is compact , and @xmath33 is a suitable contractible @xmath34-dimensional @xmath11-complex also in the case of non - trivial class group . + with an implementation in pari / gp @xcite , due to the first named author , of swan s algorithm @xcite we obtain a fundamental polyhedron for @xmath11 in @xmath19 . in the cases considered ,",
    "bianchi has already computed this polyhedron , so we have a control of the correctness of the implementation . + in the cases @xmath35 and @xmath36 , flge has computed the cell stabilizers and cell identifications ; and with our pari / gp program , we redo flge s computations and do the same computation in the cases @xmath37 and @xmath6 .",
    "we use the equivariant euler characteristic to check our computations .",
    "then we follow the lines of schwermer and vogtmann @xcite , encountering a spectral sequence which degenerates on the @xmath38-page , in contrast to the cases of trivial class group where it does so already on the @xmath39-page .",
    "this is because of the singular points in our cell complex @xmath33 , which have infinite stabilizers .",
    "so we have some additional use of homological algebra to obtain the homology of the bianchi group .",

    "we shall also make extensive use of the description of the @xmath132-differential given in @xcite .",

    "[ remark ] it would be possible to shift the technical difficulty away from homological algebra , using a topological modification of our complex . in our cases of class number two ,",

    "one could modify our complex in order to make the @xmath11-action on it proper , by replacing each singular point by an @xmath138 with the former stabilizer @xmath139 now acting properly .",
    "then the nontriviality of our differential is equivalent to the existence of a nontrivial homology relation induced by adjoining the torus @xmath140 to the fundamental domain .",
    "the following lemma will be useful for computing our @xmath133-differential in the situations where cycles for @xmath127 are given in terms of the standard resolution of @xmath11 instead of @xmath127 . in order to state it ,",

    "@xmath179 is @xmath142-linear .",
    "the augmentation @xmath180 is the composition of @xmath179 with the augmentation @xmath181 .",
    "then the statement follows from the comparison theorem @xcite*2.2.6 of fundamental homological algebra .",
    "in fact , the properties imply that @xmath179 is a chain map of resolutions lifting the identity on @xmath130 .",
    "an inverse is given by the canonical inclusion @xmath182 , and since the composition is unique up to chain homotopy equivalence , it must be homotopic to the identity .",
    "the group @xmath127 acts diagonally from the right on @xmath183 , and trivially on @xmath130 , so we can consider @xmath184 .",

    "[ corollary ] consider a cycle for @xmath187 of the form @xmath188 where @xmath189 .",
    "assume that all @xmath190 and @xmath191 are elements of @xmath11 .",
    "the ensuing homology class is then given by @xmath192    by the linearity of the described map , this covers the general case as the cycles of the form appearing in the corollary generate the submodule of all cycles .",
    "note that the cycle condition on @xmath193 says that @xmath194 which means that @xmath195 is equivalent to @xmath196 modulo @xmath142 .    using lemma [ lemma ] , we apply the map @xmath197 to get @xmath198 denote the augmentation @xmath199 by @xmath200 . as @xmath201 , we have @xmath202 which is invertible in @xmath142 , and @xmath203 .",
