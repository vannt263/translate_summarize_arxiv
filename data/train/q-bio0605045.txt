    "development of new experimental techniques , such as dna microarrays , in the late 1990 s  @xcite made a huge impact on cell biology research .",
    "such experiments generated a flood of expression data for several well - studied single - cell species for which we now have an almost complete list of not only the genes , but also the interactions between them .",
    "a cell is able to survive , grow and replicate due to the collective actions of its genes .",
    "the adaptation and robustness of its activities in a constantly changing environment is maintained by the complex network of interactions between the genes .",
    "the regulation of gene expression in a cell relies to a major extent on dedicated proteins called transcription factors ( tfs ) .",
    "@xcite these proteins come with a structure suited to recognize and bind the dna at specific locations called binding sites .",
    "the binding affinity of a tf on a certain dna segment is determined by the base sequence at the location .",
    "each tf preferentially binds certain regulatory sequences or binding motifs , within the promoter regions ( prs ) responsible for the regulation of the gene . in the case of yeast ,",
    "_ saccharomyces cerevisiae _",
    ", a list of the binding motifs for more than 100 tfs has recently been provided .",
    "@xcite it was also reported  @xcite that the tf binding sites are located with high probability within a window of several hundred bases upstream of the transcription activation site ( preceding the start codon of the gene ) , although longer - distance action is also possible .",
    "in fact , the existence of a high - affinity binding motif in a promoter region is a necessary but not sufficient condition for tf - based expression regulation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , especially in eukaryotic cells , gene regulation relies on the simultaneous action of multiple tfs .",
    "we argue that the global features of the gene regulation network depend very little on such details and are largely determined by the distribution of the amount of shared information or content , that is required for the establishment of regulatory interactions .",
    "it may be conjectured that information sharing and its distribution is the basic organizing principle which is responsible for the universality of the degree distribution of gene regulatory networks across diverse species  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose to model the transcription regulation network of yeast using the ideas of the content - based model we introduced earlier  @xcite .",
    "we are able to faithfully reproduce all the topological aspects of the gene regulatory network of yeast when the parameters of the yeast genome , in particular the distribution of information coded by the  binding sequences \" of the regulatory segments , are given as input .",
    "we compare the ensemble of the resulting model networks with the data on the yeast regulatory network available in different databases .",
    "gene regulatory networks can be naturally described as a directed graph where the nodes are the genes . a directed edge from node a to node b implies that the transcription factor produced by gene a regulates the activity of gene b. since the edges are directed , one distinguishes the in - degree ( the number of incoming edges ) , the out - degree ( number of outgoing edges ) and the total degree of a node , each with their own ( possibly distinct ) probability distributions .",
    "these distributions serve as distinguishing features of the network which a realistic model is expected to reproduce .",
    "further structural aspects of these networks are probed by measures such as the clustering coefficient @xmath0  @xcite , the degree - degree correlation between connected vertices  @xcite , the `` rich - club coefficient ''  @xcite , or the @xmath1-core decomposition  @xcite recently employed to predict new interactions in various biological systems  @xcite .",
    "this report is organized as follows : in section [ modelsect ] we introduce our model , which we compare with the experimentally determined yeast regulatory network in [ simsect ] .",
    "a discussion is provided in section [ discsect ] , while section [ methodssect ] outlines our methods .",
    "the nodes of our model network correspond to genes .",
    "we differentiate between genes which code for a transcription factor ( tf ) and those which do not .",
    "all genes are assumed to be possible targets of regulation by one or more tfs .",
    "each node has a sequence associated with it , representing the promoter region ( pr ) through which the corresponding gene may be regulated .",
    "we pick a given percentage of nodes ( around 5% , see table i ) at random , to represent tf - producing genes . with each tf - producing node / gene",
    "we also associate a second sequence , which stands for the binding motif , which the tf recognizes and binds in the promoter region of another gene .",
    "we represent both the binding motifs and the prs as random binary sequences of variable length . the mechanism for establishing connections between nodes of the gene regulatory network",
    "is given by a string matching condition  @xcite , between the binding motifs of the tf s and all possible uninterrupted subsequences of the prs .",
    "the ( directed ) network of regulatory gene interactions is then obtained by connecting each tf - producing node @xmath2 to all those nodes @xmath3 whose prs contain the binding motif associated with node @xmath2 .",
    "the amount of information coded in these randomly generated binding motifs and promoter regions constitutes the essential ingredient of our model and dictates the overall topology of the resultant networks .",
    "experimentally determined tf binding motifs are typically short sequences with a narrow length distribution , since a tf selectively binds 5 - 10 bases and not much more .",
    "a single tf can bind a range of similar motifs , and the relative frequencies of the four bases at each position within the motif contribute to the information exchanged in the binding process .",
    "the promoter regions ( prs ) which lie in the intergenic portions of the genome are typically longer and may accommodate several binding motifs ( as shown in fig .  [ model ] ) to allow graded and/or combinatorial regulation  @xcite .",
    "the bitwise length distribution of the model binding motifs was derived from the yeast data provided by harbison et al . in @xcite .",
    "the motifs were reported  @xcite as letter sequences comprising the symbols for the four bases \\{atgc } , or the symbols \\{ymkrsw } for incompletely specified bases , with the corresponding lower case letters indicating a lower confidence level . in order to account for such variations in the information content of the motifs",
    ", we assigned two bits to each of the letters \\{actg } appearing in the motif , signifying a high information content at that position , and one bit otherwise .",
    "the length of the bit sequence obtained in this way roughly corresponds to the amount of shared information , measured by the shannon entropy  @xcite , required for the binding of the tf .",
    "performing this calculation for each tf in  @xcite , we obtain the length distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ rs_dist ] .        in choosing the length distribution of the promoter regions ,",
    "about which less is known , we are guided by the finding  @xcite that most of the probability for encountering a tf binding site is contained within a window of 250 base pairs ( bps ) located approximately 100 bps upstream of a gene . the pr length distribution that we adopt within this range decays with a power law @xmath4 , with @xmath5 after the findings of almirantis and provata  @xcite for the lengths of intergenic regions .",
    "we also assign a minimum length chosen to coincide with the peak of the motif - length distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ rs_dist ] .",
    "note that the 250 bps window does not double as we move from the 4 letter alphabet to a binary one , because the matching probabilities and the total number of positions at which the tfs may bind are required to remain invariant under this transformation .",
    "the value of @xmath6 remains as the only adjustable parameter in our model , and is determined by comparing the @xmath1-core decomposition of the gene regulatory network of yeast as extracted from experimental data ( table i ) with our content - based network model , as explained in the methods section .",
    "the collection of such model networks forms an ensemble whose features are a direct consequence of the string - matching mechanism and the length distributions .",
    "clearly , each realization of the model will result in a different collection of random prs and binding motifs , and hence a somewhat different network .",
    "these features turn out to be strikingly distinct from those encountered in random  @xcite or scale - free  @xcite networks .",
    "we show below that the `` signatures '' of this ensemble are shared by the yeast regulatory network .",
    "our purpose here is to show that the experimentally determined features of the yeast regulation network follow closely those typical of the ensemble defined by our model .",
    "the topological features we will focus on are the following :    1 .",
    "* degree distribution * ( in- , out- , and total ) : the distribution of the number of connections of the nodes in a network .",
    "2 .   * clustering coefficient * : the modularity of the network .",
    "* degree - degree correlations * : average degree of the neighbors of a node with degree @xmath1 .",
    "4 .   * `` rich - club '' coefficient * : a measure of the relative connectivity among nodes whose degree is higher than a given number . 5 .",
    "* @xmath1-core structure * : the hierarchical structuring in the network    the precise definition of these quantities is given in the methods section .    here we will report the comparison of our results with the most recent yeastract  @xcite data .",
    "analogous comparisons with each of the data sources listed in table  [ tabyeast ] yield similar results ( see supplementary material ) showing that our conclusions are consistent with all the different data sets available .    in order to compare our results with the available data we generate an ensemble of realizations , with an average of @xmath7 genes in total , 4167 of which contribute to the network on the average . out of these ,",
    "202 ( making up % 4.8 of the genes ) are tf - coding genes , taking part in a total of 14365 interactions , again on the average .",
    "the corresponding values for the yeast regulatory networks reported in the publicly available data bases are given in table  [ tabyeast ] .",
    "the total degree distribution is obtained by ignoring the directionality of the interactions and is different from the superposition of in- and out - degree distributions . in fig .",
    "[ degree - dists]a , yeastract data for the degree distribution is shown on top of a scatter plot obtained by superposing the results from 100 artificial model genomes independently generated according to the rules described in section [ modelsect ] . in fig .",

    "[ coefficients](c ) , a feature common to both gene - regulation and protein - protein interaction networks @xcite , is captured accurately in our model .",

    "to give an idea of the sensitivity of the @xmath1-core analysis to the structure of the network , let us point out that , under a shuffling of the edges of the network keeping the degree of each node fixed , the typical value of the maximum number of @xmath1-cores , @xmath8 , becomes 29 rather than 9 as observed in both the real yeast regulatory network and the model ( see supplement ) .",

    "the close structural similarity between the model and the real yeast regulatory network , with respect to a diverse set of criteria , shows that they are part of the same statistical ensemble of networks , formed by random strings connected by the sequence matching rule .",
    "the sequence matching rule could more generally be viewed as an information - theoretical constraint , where the interaction between two genes requires the fulfillment of a set of conditions which we symbolically represent as the matching of two random sequences . the more stringent the prerequisites of the interaction , the longer is the random  binding motif \" that is to be matched .",
    "the length of the pr establishes the size of the phase space in which the motif is to be sought .",
    "the properties of the network are then determined by the distributions obeyed by the lengths of the binding motifs as well as the promoting regions .",
    "interpreted within this information - theoretical framework , our model has sufficient generality to accommodate other interactions based on lock - and - key mechanisms , such as protein networks , where the interactions are dictated by certain steric and chemical conditions .",
    "the topological features of the networks investigated here and shown to be shared by the yeast regulatory network strongly point to the possibility that these networks did not have to be assembled from scratch , but rather emerged spontaneously , given any sufficiently long linear code .",
    "this proposition by no means minimizes the role of evolutionary pressures on such networks ; instead , it suggests that a network with essentially the current topology could have provided a starting point for further fine - tuning . as a case in point , it has recently been demonstrated that evolution under duplication and divergence  @xcite may leave the topological features of such networks essentially invariant  @xcite .",
    "such a perspective will hopefully bring us a step closer to envisioning how complex structures may have come into existence , by shifting some of the load from the shoulders of evolution onto the laws of probability .",
