    "outflows and winds are widely observed in many types of galaxies , from active to normal ( e.g. chartas et al . , 2003 ; pounds et al . , 2003a , 2006 ; obrien et al . , 2005 , holt et al . , 2008 ; krongold et al . , 2007 ;",
    "tremonti et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "there is often a strong presumption that the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) is implicated .",
    "although other types of driving exist , e.g. by supernovae or starbursts , in many cases these phenomena are themselves associated with accretion episodes on to the smbh .    from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "outflows driven by black holes offer a simple way of establishing relations between the smbh and its host galaxy , and hence potential explanations for the @xmath4 and @xmath8 relations ( ferrarese & merritt , 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "such outflows are plausible , as agn must feed at high rates to grow the observed smbh masses , given the short duty cycle implied by the rarity of agn among all galaxies .",
    "there is no obvious reason why these rates should respect the hole s eddington limit , and outflows are a natural consequence .",
    "however it is unclear just how , if at all , the various types of observed outflows mentioned in the first paragraph fit together in terms of these ideas .",
    "this paper aims to clarify this .",
    "super  eddington accretion is widely observed in accreting binary systems .",
    "for example the well  known system ss433 has an eddington ratio @xmath9 of order 5000 ( e.g. king et al . , 2000 ;",
    "begelman et al . , 2006 ) . here",
    "@xmath10 are the accretion rate and the eddington value respectively .",
    "the distinctive feature of agn accretion is that such large eddington ratios are unlikely . to see this we note that the maximum possible accretion rate is the dynamical rate @xmath11 the dynamical rate applies when a gas mass which was previously self  supporting against gravity is destabilized and falls freely on to the black hole .",
    "equation ( [ dyn ] ) describes the case where gas is initially in rough virial equilibrium in the bulge of a galaxy with velocity dispersion @xmath7 and baryonic mass fraction @xmath12 .",
    "parametrizing , we find @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and we have taken @xmath15 . we compare this with @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath18 the radiative efficiency of accretion , and @xmath19 the electron scattering opacity .",
    "we evaluate this for @xmath20 and black hole masses @xmath6 lying close to the observed @xmath4 relation @xmath21 to find @xmath22 and thus an eddington ratio @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath25 for the black holes in agn , and @xmath26 is an upper limit to @xmath27 , modest values @xmath28 of the eddington ratio are likely .",
    "for completeness i note that much higher eddington ratios can occur if the gas mass which is destabilized was previously held together by self ",
    "gravity , e.g. as in a star . in this case",
    "we find a maximum dynamical rate @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the stellar mass and @xmath31 its orbital velocity and period .",
    "this gives rates @xmath32 in stellar ",
    "mass binary systems .",
    "rather lower values result for tidal disruption of stars near smbh because the stellar debris is only accreted over a spread in orbital times ( e.g. lodato et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "motivated by the results of the previous section , i examine the properties of winds from smbh accreting with modest eddington ratios @xmath28 .",
    "i assume that the winds are quasi ",
    "spherical , over solid angle @xmath33 , with @xmath34 ( this is confirmed for pg1211 + 143 ; pounds & reeves , 2009 ) .",
    "it is well known that winds of this type have electron scattering optical depth @xmath35 measured from infinity in to a distance of order the schwarzschild radius @xmath36 ( e.g. king & pounds , 2003 ) .",
    "this means that on average every emitted photon scatters about once before escaping to infinity , which in turn suggests that the total wind momentum must be of order the photon momentum , i.e. @xmath37 as is for example also found for the winds of hot stars . using ( [ edd ] )",
    "gives the wind velocity @xmath38 this agrees with the fact that winds are always found to have a terminal velocity typical of the escape velocity from the radius at which they are launched , here several tens of @xmath39 . as expected , using this value of @xmath40 in the mass conservation equation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mass density , self ",
    "consistently shows that the optical depth @xmath43 of the wind is @xmath44 ( cf king & pounds , 2003 , eqn .",
    "since the wind moves with speed @xmath45 , it can persist long after the agn is observed to have become sub  eddington .",
    "the duration of the lag is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the radial extent of the wind ( i.e. the shock radius , as we shall see below ) . for @xmath48",
    "pc this lag is at least a century , and far longer lags are possible , as we shall see .",
    "this may be the reason why agn showing other signs of super  eddington phenomena ( e.g. narrow  line seyfert 2 galaxies ) are nevertheless seen to have sub ",
    "eddington luminosities ( e.g. ngc 4051 : denney et al . , 2009 )",
    ".    we can use ( [ v ] , [ mass ] ) to estimate the ionization parameter @xmath49 of the wind . here",
    "@xmath50 is the ionizing luminosity , with @xmath51 a dimensionless parameter specified by the quasar spectrum , and @xmath52 is the number density .",
    "this gives @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "equation ( [ ion2 ] ) shows that the wind momentum and mass rates determine its ionization parameter : for a given quasar spectrum , the predominant ionization state is such that the threshold photon energy defining @xmath56 , and the corresponding ionization parameter @xmath57 , together satisfy ( [ ion2 ] ) .",
    "this requires high excitation : a low threshold photon energy ( say in the infrared ) would imply a large value of @xmath58 , but the high value of @xmath57 then given by ( [ ion2 ] ) would require the presence of very highly ionized species , physically incompatible with such low excitation .    for suitably chosen continuum spectra",
    ", it is possible to envisage a range of solutions of ( [ ion2 ] ) , and it is even possible that a given spectrum may allow more than one solution , the result being specified by initial conditions .",
    "however for a typical quasar spectrum , an obvious self  consistent solution of ( [ ion2 ] ) is @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "this describes the case where the quasar is currently radiating at the eddington limit .",
    "however as remarked after eqn ( [ mass ] ) , we can also have situations where the quasar s luminosity has dropped after an eddington episode , but the wind is still flowing , with @xmath62 . in this case the ionizing luminosity @xmath63 in ( [ ion2 ] ) takes a lower value , giving a lower value of @xmath57 .",
    "for example a quasar of luminosity @xmath64 would have @xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds to a photon energy threshold appropriate for helium or hydrogenlike iron ( i.e. @xmath65  kev ) .",
    "we conclude that    _ eddington winds from agn are likely to have velocities @xmath66 , and show the presence of helium or hydrogenlike iron .",
    "_    a number of such winds are known ( see cappi , 2006 , for a review ) .",
    "this section shows that it is no coincidence that in all cases the wind velocity is @xmath0 , and further that they are all found by identifying blueshifted resonance lines of fe xxv , xxvi in absorption .",
    "conversely , any observed wind with these properties automatically satisfies the momentum and mass relations ( [ mom ] , [ mass ] ) , strongly suggesting launching by an agn accreting at a slightly super  eddington rate .",
    "two further remarks are relevant here .",
    "we note first that ( [ mom ] ) implies a kinetic energy rate @xmath67 implying a mechanical ` energy efficiency ' @xmath68 wrt @xmath17 .",
    "cosmological simulations typically adopt such values in order to produce an @xmath69 relation in agreement with observation ( e.g. di matteo , 2005 ) .",
    "as we have seen , this implicitly means that they adopt the single  scattering momentum relation ( [ mom ] ) .",
    "we shall see below ( in section 5 ) that there must also be an implicit assumption of momentum rather than energy driving , i.e. that the wind interacts with the host galaxy through its ram pressure rather than its energy .",
    "i note that the near  eddington regime considered here differs from the hyper ",
    "eddington regime discussed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , where the much larger optical depth leads to the energy relation @xmath70 instead of the momentum relation ( [ mom ] ) .",
    "this generally only holds in accreting stellar  mass binary systems ( see section 6 below ) , but king ( 2009 ) discusses a possible case involving supermassive black holes .",
    "finally , we should also note that although we assume here that eddington or super  eddington accretion leads to winds and outflow , some authors have considered alternative possibilities .",
    "the main observational constraint on these ideas is the soltan argument ( soltan , 1982 ) .",
    "this relates the background radiation of the universe to the mass density in supermassive black holes , and with subsequent work ( e.g. yu & tremaine , 2002 ) is generally interpreted as implying that most of the mass of the smbh in galaxy centres results from luminous accretion with a typical radiative efficiency @xmath71 .",
    "however since the value of @xmath18 appearing in the soltan argument is a global average over many different accretion events , it is clearly still possible for some fraction of the mass growth to occur in other ways which produce little outflow , as for example in the so  called polish doughnuts ( see abramowicz , 2009 , for a recent review ) .",
    "this type of accretion flow could reduce or even remove the mechanical feedback between black hole growth and the host galaxy .",
    "the fact that the @xmath4 relation emerges ( without free parameter ) from consideration of momentum  driven eddington winds tends to support the straightforward interpretation of the soltan argument adopted here , but one should be alive to alternative possibilities .",
    "it is clear that an eddington wind of the type discussed above can have a significant effect on its host galaxy .",
    "the kinetic power of the wind is @xmath72 where we have used ( [ mom ] ) and ( [ v ] ) .",
    "if the wind persists as the hole doubles its mass ( i.e. for a salpeter time ) , its total energy is @xmath73  erg , where @xmath74 is the hole mass in units of @xmath75 .",
    "this formally exceeds the binding energy @xmath76  erg of a galaxy bulge with baryonic mass @xmath77 and velocity dispersion @xmath78 ( as suggested by the @xmath79 and @xmath4 relations ) . evidently the coupling of wind energy to the galaxy must be inefficient , as black holes would destroy or at least severely modify their host bulges in any significant super  eddington growth phase .    to investigate this",
    "we must consider how the wind interacts with the interstellar medium of the host .",
    "just as in the corresponding problem for a stellar wind , the interaction must successively involve an inner ( reverse ) shock , slowing the central wind , a contact discontinuity between the shocked wind and the shocked , swept ",
    "up interstellar medium , and an outer ( forward ) shock driven into this medium and sweeping it outwards , ahead of the shocked wind ( see fig .",
    "the inefficient coupling of wind energy to the galactic baryons noted above strongly suggests that the shocked wind cools rapidly after passing through the inner shock .",
    "this removes the thermal pressure generated in the shock , and leaves only the preshock ram pressure acting on the interstellar medium .",
    "a clear candidate for this shock cooling is the inverse compton effect on the quasar s radiation field ( king , 2003 ) .",
    "we note that this typically has compton temperature @xmath80  k , whereas the formal temperature at the inner adiabatic shock is @xmath81  k. the quasar radiation cools the inner shock efficiently , provided that this is within galaxy  scale distances from the centre ( king , 2003 ) .",
    "inverse compton cooling should produce a component in the quasar spectrum characterized by @xmath82  kev and with a luminosity @xmath83 , i.e. about @xmath84 of the quasar s bolometric output .",
    "i note that even if the quasar becomes sub  eddington , leaving a wind persisting for a lag time @xmath85 , its radiation field is still able to cool the shock efficiently .    given this efficient cooling , the inner ( adiabatic ) shock and very narrow associated cooling region together constitute an ` isothermal shock ' .",
    "the gas density jumps by a factor @xmath86 at the adiabatic shock , accompanied by a velocity drop by the same factor .",
    "it is then strongly compressed in the cooling region while the velocity slows to low values ( see fig .",
    "since the cooling is efficient the whole region is very thin compared with the shock radius @xmath87 , and we can regard the shock as locally plane . the rankine ",
    "hugoniot relations across this isothermal shock then show that the mass flow rate @xmath88 remains constant , while the postshock gas pressure drops to the value @xmath89 i.e. the preshock ram pressure . with a constant cooling time , as expected , the postshock temperature and velocity @xmath90 drop approximately linearly with distance behind the shock , and the density rises as @xmath91 , strongly increasing its emission measure .",
    "the gas is likely to be in photoionization equilibrium as it has low optical depth to the quasar radiation , and the increased densities imply short recombination times .",
    "the mass conservation equation ( [ mass ] ) and ionization parameter ( [ ion ] ) combine to give @xmath92 in this region . _",
    "we thus expect a correlation between velocity and excitation .",
    "_ the rapid cooling in this region implies a rapid transition between the immediate postshock regime ( @xmath93 , kev excitation ) and the much slower and cooler compressed state .",
    "there is direct observational evidence for this cooling shock in ngc 4051 ( pounds et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "pounds et al ( 2004 ) had already noted a correlation of outflow velocity with ionization in this source .",
    "given the basic structure sketched in the last section , we can investigate how the shock pattern moves through the interstellar medium of the host galaxy .",
    "the cooled postshock gas exerts the ram pressure ( [ ram ] ) on the undisturbed interstellar medium of the galaxy , driving an outer shock into it and sweeping it up into a relatively dense shell of increasing mass .",
    "the equation of motion of the shell in the momentum ",
    "driven limit is @xmath94 + { gm(r)[m + m_{\\rm tot}(r)]\\over r^2 } =   4\\pi\\rho v^2 = { \\le\\over c } \\label{motion}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the swept  up interstellar gas mass , @xmath6 is the black hole mass , @xmath96 is the total mass within radius @xmath47 ( including any dark matter ) , and @xmath12 is the gas fraction ( note that in eqn ( 2 ) of king , 2005 the suffix ` tot ' was inadvertently missed off the relevant quantity ) .",
    "this equation takes different forms depending on which part of the host galaxy the shell has reached .      close to the black hole ,",
    "i.e. within its sphere of influence , of radius @xmath97 the black hole dominates the gravitational potential , and there is essentially no dark matter . then ( [ motion ] ) becomes @xmath94 + { gm(r)m\\over r^2 } = { \\le\\over c}\\ ] ] multiplying through by @xmath98 we find the first integral @xmath99 ^ 2\\over 2gm } = { 4\\pi\\over \\kappa}\\int m(r){\\rm d}r - \\int{m^2(r)\\over r^2 } { \\rm d}r .",
    "\\label{int}\\ ] ] this equation shows that for any reasonable distribution of matter @xmath100 , the shell can not move outwards unless @xmath101 where we have parametrized the radius in units of the schwarzschild radius @xmath39 of the black hole , with @xmath24 .",
    "the physical content of ( [ limit ] ) is that the eddington thrust can not lift the weight of a more massive shell at the radius @xmath47 .",
    "an equivalent formulation is @xmath102 i.e. that the maximum shell mass at a given radius has thomson depth @xmath44 .",
    "we see that even relatively small amounts of gas sufficiently close to the black hole can stall the outflow .",
    "however in this case , the gas from the central eddington wind would accumulate at the stalled shock until its own mass violated the limit ( [ limit ] ) .",
    "the equivalent ( [ limit2 ] ) shows that the inner wind shock would become optically thick to the quasar radiation , causing multiple scattering and enhancing the momentum deposition .",
    "the postshock pressure would begin to exceed @xmath103 by large factors .",
    "unless the black hole had a very low mass , this enhanced pressure would cause the shell to move out again .",
    "this argument shows that the shell moves so as to keep the optical depth of the eddington wind @xmath104 , i.e. @xmath105 so that @xmath106 and @xmath107 this implies that the shell would reach a radius @xmath108 in no more than a year . at this point the swept  up mass ( from ( [ limit ] ) could be as large as @xmath109 , which would imply an emission measure comparable with an agn broad  line region .",
    "the shell would reach @xmath110 in @xmath111  yr , with a velocity @xmath112 .",
    "thus even a shell whose progress is blocked by an unfavourable matter distribution reaches @xmath113 in about @xmath114  yr , assuming that the quasar wind continues to drive it . in the opposite extreme , where the mass of the swept",
    " up matter is low , the time to emerge decreases as @xmath115 , and is limited only by the wind  travel time @xmath116  yr for arbitrarily low @xmath117 .",
    "this mechanism is clearly limited to the inner parts of a galaxy bulge , as a shell driven in this way can typically only reach radii @xmath118  pc in a salpeter time , and @xmath119  kpc even after a hubble time .",
    "accordingly we do not consider this mechanism in the next subsection , which treats outflows at radii @xmath120 .",
    "far from the black hole ( i.e. for @xmath121 ) the dark matter term @xmath122 becomes dominant in the equation of motion ( [ motion ] ) , and we can drop the black hole mass term involving @xmath6 .",
    "the condition that the shell should just be able to escape to infinity specifies a relation between the black hole mass @xmath6 and the parameters of the galaxy potential , particularly the velocity dispersion , i.e. an @xmath4 relation . for a general mass distribution @xmath123",
    "we can use the first integral ( [ int ] ) to do this .",
    "however for a simple isothermal potential the equation of motion has the analytic solution @xmath124t^2 + 2r_0v_0 t + r_0 ^ 2 \\label{shell}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 are the position and speed of the shell at time @xmath126 ( king , 2005 ) . for large times the first term dominates , and the shell can reach arbitrarily large radii if and only if the black hole mass exceeds the critical value @xmath127 this is very close to the observed @xmath4 relation ( [ msig ] ) ( cf king , 2005 ) . at sufficiently large radii",
    "the quasar radiation field is too dilute to cool the wind shock , and the shell accelerates beyond the escape value , cutting off the galaxy and establishing the black  hole mass  bulge  mass relation ( cf king , 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "we see that the time for a continuously  driven shell to reach a given radius @xmath128  kpc is @xmath129 for large @xmath130 this time is significantly longer than the salpeter time , implying that the black hole mass @xmath6 must increase above the threshold value @xmath3 before the shell reaches large radii .",
    "this may suggest that for galaxies with large bulge radii , the black hole mass may tend to lie above the @xmath131 relation .",
    "there is some suggestion of this in the observational data ( marconi & hunt , 2003 ) .",
    "however the uncertainty here is in knowing just what radius the shell must reach in order to shut off further accretion on to the black hole .",
    "we see from the reasoning of the last section that the interaction beween the quasar wind and its host establishing the @xmath4 relation is  crucially  ` momentum  driven ' rather than ` energy  driven ' .",
    "this equivalent to requiring efficient shock cooling . an energy  driven shock ( e.g. silk & rees , 1998 ) would result in a much smaller black hole mass for for a given @xmath7 than observed . instead of the momentum rate @xmath132 balancing the weight of swept  up gas @xmath133 , which is what produces the momentum",
    " driven relation ( [ msig2 ] ) , an energy ",
    "driven shock would equate the energy deposition rate to the rate of working against this weight . in the near  eddington regime",
    "the result is @xmath134 i.e. @xmath135 which lies well below the observed relation ( [ msig ] ) .",
    "the coupling adopted in cosmological simulations evidently ensure that the interstellar medium feels the outflow momentum rather than its energy , in addition to the ` energy efficiency ' @xmath136 noted above .",
    "i note finally that if instead of the near  eddington regime considered here , an energy ",
    "driven outflow had a large eddington ratio @xmath137 , we would have to replace ( [ work ] ) by @xmath138 and thus ( [ energysig ] ) by @xmath139 which is still smaller .",
    "indeed one could imagine a situation in which the central black holes of medium or large galaxies obeyed ( [ energysig2 ] ) rather than the observed ( [ msig ] ) and self  consistently had central accretion rates well above eddington , since ( [ eddrat ] ) would now become @xmath140 the high optical depth implied by the large eddington ratio might then prevent efficient compton cooling , justifying the original hypothesis of energy ",
    "driven outflow .",
    "it is interesting that observation does not seem to give examples of this possibility , i.e. medium or large galaxies with very low  mass central black holes which could accrete at very high eddington ratios",
    ". the reason may be the inherent tendency of this low  mass sequence to move irreversibly over time to the high  mass case specified by the usual @xmath4 relation ( [ msig ] ) : thus steady sub or near  eddington accretion on to such a hole could eventually increase its mass to the point that it was unlikely to accrete at high eddington ratios .",
    "this would then imply efficient cooling of the shock and thus a momentum  driven outflow .",
    "on large scales the outflows described in section 5.2 above all have ( outer ) shock velocities limited by the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath7 . yet optical and uv observations give clear evidence of outflows with velocities of several times this value .",
    "these can not be the central quasar winds with @xmath141 discussed in section 3 .",
    "outflows confined within a few parsecs of the black hole may be the near  zone winds inside @xmath142 discussed in section 5.1 , but high  velocity outflows are often seen or inferred on scales comparable with the entire galaxy .",
    "some of these outflows are seen in compact radio sources ( e.g. holt et al . , 2008 ) , some in seyfert galaxies which are clearly sub  eddington , and others in post  starburst galaxies ( cf tremonti et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the latter could result from the combined effects of stellar winds and supernovae , but the known association of starbursts and agn leave open the possibility that black holes may be the ultimate driver .",
    "there is a simple interpretation of such large  scale high  velocity outflows .",
    "consider a galaxy in which the smbh has reached the mass @xmath3 given by eqn ( [ msig2 ] ) , with the cosmic gas fraction @xmath143 .",
    "its bulge gas will probably be severely depleted . in a subsequent minor accretion event triggering agn activity",
    ", the effective gas fraction in the bulge will be @xmath144 . if accretion on to the smbh becomes super ",
    "eddington for a time @xmath145  yr , the agn must drive an outflow shock beyond the radius @xmath142 .",
    "however because of the discrepancy between @xmath12 ( establishing the black hole mass ) , and @xmath146 ( the current gas fraction ) , the shell radius now obeys a modified form of the analytic solution ( [ shell ] ) , namely @xmath147t^2 + 2r_0v_0 t + r_0 ^ 2 \\label{shell2}\\ ] ] where the @xmath17 term involves @xmath12 rather than @xmath146 .",
    "thus at large @xmath148 we have @xmath149\\sigma^2t^2 \\simeq 2{f_g\\over f'_g}\\sigma^2t^2   \\label{shell3}\\ ] ] where we have taken @xmath150 in the last form .",
    "this shows that the shell reaches velocities @xmath151 because its inertia is much lower than the one previously expelled by the eddington thrust in the accretion episode which defined the smbh mass .",
    "if at some point the agn activity turns off , we can match another solution of the form ( [ shell ] ) , but with @xmath17 formally @xmath152 , to the solution ( [ shell2 ] ) .",
    "this solution reveals that a coasting shell stalls only at distances @xmath153 times its radius @xmath154 at the point when agn activity ceased , and thus persists for a timescale @xmath155  yr , ( cf [ flowtime ] ) .",
    "episodic minor accretion events of this type therefore naturally produce large  scale outflows with velocities @xmath156 .",
    "moreover , since they persist as fossil winds long after the agn has become faint , they can have total momentum considerably higher than could be driven by the _",
    "current _ agn radiation pressure , i.e. well in excess of the apparent momentum limit .",
    "there is a second possible type of rapid outflow on large spatial scales .",
    "it is inherently rarer than those triggered by minor accretion events , as described in the previous subsection , but represents a decisive stage in the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "consider a major eddington accretion event in which the central smbh attains its critical mass @xmath3 .",
    "equation ( [ msig2 ] ) shows that the resulting momentum ",
    "driven outflow does not stall , as it does for lower smbh masses , but continues out to large radii . beyond a critical radius ,",
    "the quasar radiation field is too dilute to cool the wind shock on its ( momentum  driven ) flow time @xmath157 .",
    "if eddington accretion on to the central smbh is still continuing , the outflow becomes energy  driven .",
    "the extra thermal energy now accelerates the shell further , eventually to a terminal speed @xmath158^{1/3 } \\simeq 875\\sigma_{200}^{2/3}~{\\rm km\\ s}^{-1 } \\label{ve}\\ ] ] ( king , 2005 ) .",
    "this is fast enough to drive gas out of the galaxy potential entirely .",
    "this process ultimately limits the gas content of the galaxy bulge and hence establishes the black hole ",
    "bulge mass relation ( king , 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "it is clearly a rarer type of event than outflows driven by minor accretion events as described above .",
    "a clear observational distinction is that these rare energy ",
    "driven outflows require that the quasar driving the outflow should be radiating at the eddington limit .",
    "we have shown that eddington accretion episodes in agn produce winds with velocities @xmath0 and ionization parameters @xmath159  ( cgs ) requiring the presence of resonance lines of helium and hydrogenlike iron .",
    "these properties follow from momentum and mass conservation , and agree with recent x  ray observations of high  speed outflows from agn . because the winds have speeds @xmath45 they can persist long after the agn have become sub  eddington .    the wind creates a strong cooling shock as it impacts the interstellar medium of the host galaxy .",
    "this cooling region may be observable , as it produces an inverse compton continuum and lower  excitation emission lines associated with lower velocities .",
    "the shell of matter swept up by the ( momentum  driven ) shocked wind emerges from the black hole s sphere of influence on a timescale @xmath111  yr . the shell then stalls unless the black hole mass has reached the value @xmath3 implied by the @xmath4 relation . if the wind shock did not cool , as suggested here , the resulting ( ` energy  driven ' ) outflow would imply a far smaller smbh mass than actually observed . in galaxies with large bulges the black hole must grow somewhat beyond this value , suggesting that the observed @xmath5 relation may curve upwards at large @xmath6",

    "<S> because the wind is significantly subluminal , it can persist long after the agn is observed to have become sub  eddington . </S>",
    "<S> the wind creates a strong cooling shock as it interacts with the interstellar medium of the host galaxy , and this cooling region may be observable in an inverse compton continuum and lower  excitation emission lines associated with lower velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the shell of matter swept up by the ( ` momentum  driven ' ) shocked wind must propagate beyond the black hole s sphere of influence on a timescale @xmath2  yr . outside this radius </S>",
    "<S> the shell stalls unless the black hole mass has reached the value @xmath3 implied by the @xmath4 relation . </S>",

    "<S> outflow would imply a far smaller smbh mass than actually observed . in galaxies with large bulges the black hole may grow somewhat beyond this value , suggesting that the observed @xmath5 relation may curve upwards at large @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> minor accretion events with small gas fractions can produce galaxy  wide outflows with velocities significantly exceeding @xmath7 , including fossil outflows in galaxies where there is little current agn activity . </S>",
