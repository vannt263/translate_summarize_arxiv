    "there are many ways to display the time . for example",
    "the familiar analog display with a dial and clock hands or digital displays using numerals .",
    "in addition there are binary displays which are a bit more difficult to read .",
    "a well known example is the so called berlin clock ( also called `` set theory '' clock ) , invented by and first installed in 1975 on the kurfrstendamm in berlin .",
    "the display of this clock consists of bits realized by lamps ( or leds in a table version ) which correspond to a certain amount of time .",
    "lamps in the same row correspond to the same amount . for the berlin clock ,",
    "every lamp in the top row corresponds to 5 hours .",
    "the corresponding values in the second row is 1 h. in the third and fourth row the lamps represent 5 and 1 minute(s ) , respectively . for a better readability , every third lamp in the third row",
    "has a different color .",
    "the time is then just given by adding the amounts of all lamps lit .",
    "[ berlinuhr ] shows the berlin clock .",
    "the time displayed is 10:31 .    ,",
    "a new , more esthetic and geometric , form of display will be presented now . here",
    "the lamps or leds are arranged in form of a triangle ( see fig .  [ uhr ] ) .",
    "again , lamps in the same row correspond to the same amount of time .",
    "the corresponding values are listed in the following table .    [ cols=\"^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     if all lamps are on , the time displayed is @xmath0 which means that this triangular form with 5 rows of lamps is perfectly suited for a 12 hour display . using two different colors , one can achieve a 24h display ; for example green for _ am _ and red for _ pm_. fig .",
    "[ moreex ] shows more examples .    ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]    a java applet of this clock can be found on http://joerg.pretz.de .",
    "we now come to the question why our system of time divisions allows such a triangular display ?",
    "first let us compare the berlin and the triangular clock .",
    "common to both concepts is the fact that the amount of time a certain lamp corresponds to in the @xmath1th row equals @xmath2 times the amount in the @xmath3th row where @xmath4 is the number of lamps in the @xmath3th row . here are two examples to illustrate this :    * berlin clock : 3rd row has @xmath5 lamps representing 5 minutes each .",
    "thus for the 2nd row one finds @xmath6 min@xmath7h . * triangular clock : 3rd row has @xmath8 lamps representing 30 minutes each .",
    "thus for the 2nd row one finds @xmath9 min@xmath10h .",
    "but what does @xmath12 mean ?",
    "a row with @xmath3 lamps allows to display @xmath13 states , from all lamps off to all lamps on .",
    "( note that in the way the display is used here , not all of the @xmath14 possible states are used because if a lamp is on , also the lamps left to it are on in the same row . ) for a triangular display with @xmath3 lamps in the bottom row and the number of lamps decreasing by one in every following row the total number of states is thus @xmath15    now , note that our system of time measurement is based on divisions which have many factors , e.g. @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for a 12 hour display with a precision of one minute the number of states one has to display is thus @xmath18 which perfectly fits in a triangular display with five rows .",
    "thus the whole concept works because our system of time divisions is based on a sexagesimal system dating back to the babylonian  @xcite rather than a decimal system ."
