    "graphene is a promising material for high - frequency electronic applications , ranging from dc to thz@xcite , such as transistors@xcite , low - noise amplifiers@xcite , mixers@xcite , frequency doublers@xcite and microwave radiation detectors@xcite .",
    "this is because of its high carrier mobility ( @xmath5 @xmath6 at room temperature@xcite ) , ambipolar transport@xcite , high fermi velocity @xmath7 m/s [ ] , current carrying capacity@xcite ( @xmath81.8@xmath9 ) and thermal conductivity@xcite ( @xmath85000w@xmath10 ) .",
    "power dissipation through a channel of resistance r carrying radio - frequency ( 1 - 300mhz ) and microwave signals ( 0.3 - 300ghz ) is also an important parameter , particularly for applications in high - speed electronics , such as transistors and low noise amplifiers .",
    "any increase of channel resistance at higher frequencies ( above the dc value ) , @xmath11/r_{dc}$ ] , will contribute excess noise and impact the signal - to - noise ratio at both the component level and when integrated into a complete system - on - chip@xcite or microwave monolithic integrated circuit ( mmics)@xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath12 on frequency therefore needs to be determined accurately to ensure that the power dissipation does not become prohibitive for applications in a given frequency range ( such as microwaves or thz ) .",
    "power dissipation , e.g. , degrades the signal - to - noise ratio in high - frequency detectors@xcite .",
    "metals and superconductors show strong frequency dependence of their surface impedance which manifests as electromagnetic losses@xmath13 and skin effect losses@xcite@xmath14 , leading to an additional ac resistance .",
    "the ac ( or dynamic ) conductivity @xmath15 of single layer graphene ( slg ) from dc to optical frequencies can be modeled by the kubo formalism@xcite as [ ] : @xmath16\\\\ & & + \\frac{e^2}{4\\hbar}\\left[h(\\omega/2)+\\frac{4i\\omega}{\\pi } \\int_0^\\infty\\frac{h(\\epsilon)-h(\\omega/2)}{\\omega^2 - 4 \\epsilon^2}d\\epsilon\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where t is the temperature , @xmath17 the reduced planck s constant , _ i _ the imaginary unit , @xmath18 the fermi energy , @xmath19 the boltzmann s constant , and @xmath20 is [ ] : @xmath21 eq.[kubo ] consists of intra- and inter - band contributions , corresponding to the first and second term respectively .",
    "the conductivity depends on the energy of the incident rf radiation , such that the interband term corresponds to electron - hole ( e - h ) pair generation and recombination events , whereas the intraband converges to the drude model for t=0k . in the dc to 13.5ghz range ,",
    "relevant for devices and applications such as transistors , mixers and low noise amplifiers , the inter - band transitions are negligible and eq.[kubo ] can be rewritten as : @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the electron scattering rate ( in units of @xmath24 ) due to electron interactions with impurities , defects , phonons and disorder and @xmath25 is the chemical potential",
    "( [ intra ] ) can be rewritten in the drude form ( at room temperature and constant @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) as [ ] : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the real and imaginary components of the conductivity .",
    "the prefactor @xmath30 , known as the drude weight@xcite , is : @xmath31\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath30 for graphene is different from conventional metals due to its linear energy - wavevector dispersion ( in contrast with @xmath32 in metals , where @xmath33 is the carrier effective mass and its number density@xcite ) .",
    "eq.([drude ] ) suggests that , for @xmath34 , graphene s conductivity should be frequency - independent and approximately equal to the dc conductivity @xmath35 .",
    "given that @xmath26 of slg is in the order of 1 - 20 thz ( depending on doping , material quality , i.e. exfoliated / chemical vapor deposited ( cvd ) ) , which corresponds to @xmath36ps [ ] , graphene s conductivity should be frequency - independent up to@xmath80.5 - 1thz .",
    "however , experimental confirmation of this frequency - independent response of graphene to transport rf and microwave signals has not been reported , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we integrate slg into coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) transmission lines in order to investigate its rf and microwave transport properties .",
    "the cpw transmission lines ( fig.[graph : cpw ] a , b ) consist of a central signal conductor in close proximity with two ground conductors@xcite .",
    "these are ideal for investigating the rf to mm - wave electromagnetic transport properties of a variety of materials and devices@xcite , since their properties are well established theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite . compared to microstrips@xcite , cpws enable quasi - transverse electromagnetic ( tem ) wave propagation ( where quasi - tem refers to the presence of small but finite longitudinal electric and magnetic field components ) , low dispersion of its characteristic impedance , low cross - talk ( or interference with any nearby devices ) and broadband ( dc to mm - wave@xcite ) operation .",
    "furthermore , cpws can also be used as a building block for the integration of passive and active components into complete systems - on - chip@xcite or mmics@xcite ( which integrate a range of functionalities , such as mixing , amplification , switching etc . at microwave frequencies ) .",
    "cpws allow accurate measurement of rf properties , since their electromagnetic properties are traceable to well - established and extensively used short - open - load - thru ( solt ) reference standards ( linked to the benchmark national institute for standards and technology multiline thru - reflect - line procedures@xcite ) , provided by instrument manufactures and national metrology institutes to enable calibration of vector network analyzers ( vnas)@xcite .",

    "the cpws length is optimized to@xmath42 in order to accommodate the tapering of the signal conductor from its contact pad of dimensions 100@xmath41 x 100@xmath41 to a 10@xmath41 x 10@xmath41 slg sample .",
    "the contacts are formed by evaporating 2 nm cr/80 nm au .",
    "the optimized au cpws show excellent broadband rf and microwave transmission properties from dc to 13.5ghz , as discussed later .",

    "after contact fabrication , only small changes of pos(g ) and pos(2d ) ( @xmath81@xmath48 ) occur , while i(2d)/i(g ) is reduced from 6 to 4 , indicating that that the doping of the sample increases during the process , but still remains below@xmath85@xmath49 .",

    "no significant d peak is detected at any stage of the fabrication process nor after the rf measurements , proving the high structural quality of the flakes and the non - invasiveness of the measurements .",
    "the gcpws are first characterized at dc using a parameter analyzer in a 2-probe configuration since slg is positioned in the signal conductor ( i.e. source - drain configuration ) . in order to contact the slg , the cpws are tapered from the contact pads to match the width of the selected slg flakes , whilst maintaining the 50@xmath50 characteristic impedance of the waveguide , as shown in fig[graph : cpw](c ) .",

    "<S> the graphene channel is modeled as a parallel resistive - capacitive network with a frequency dependence identical to that of the drude conductivity with momentum relaxation time@xmath4ps , highlighting the influence of alternating current ( ac ) electron transport on the electromagnetic properties of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> this can lead to optimized design of high - speed analogue field - effect transistors , mixers , frequency doublers , low - noise amplifiers and radiation detectors . </S>"
