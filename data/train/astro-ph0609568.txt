    "dark energy ( de ) is one of the main puzzles of cosmology .",
    "it could be a scalar field @xmath1 , self  interacting through a potential @xmath2 ( wetterich 1988 , ratra & peebles 1988 ) , so that @xmath3 provided that @xmath4 , so that @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the metrics and dots indicate differentiation with respect to @xmath7 ( conformal time ) .",
    "this kind of de is dubbed _ dynamical _ de ( dde ) or _",
    "quintessence_.    the most significant potentials are those allowing tracker solutions , so limiting the impact of initial conditions . among them , we consider here the sugra ( brax & martin 1999 , 2001 ; brax , martin & riazuelo 2000 ) and ratra & peebles ( 1988 , 2003 ) potentials @xmath8 @xmath9 ( @xmath10 : planck mass ) ; in the recent times , they yield @xmath11 close to unity and fastly variable or @xmath11 farther from unity and slowly variable , respectively . in a flat model , once the de density parameters @xmath12 is assigned , either @xmath13 or the energy @xmath14 can still be freely chosen .",
    "sugra and rp behave differently when @xmath1 approaches @xmath15 . here",
    ", however , we shall not deal with late epochs and our expressions , worked out for rp , suit sugra as well .",
    "tracker solutions are then usually found by considering the equation of motion @xmath16 and seeking solutions of the form @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is a reference time and @xmath19 is the field value at that time ) .",
    "they are fixed once the time dependence of the scale factor @xmath20 is set . in turn , we can however write @xmath21 so that @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) in the radiation ( matter ) dominated eras and is actually @xmath24 dependent around matter  radiation equality .    in this note we give a single expression for the tracker solution holding before , during and after equality , occurring at @xmath25 .",
    "this expression improves the tracker solution expression , known for @xmath26 , when @xmath24 approaches @xmath27 .",
    "it also neatly improves the tracker solution known for @xmath28 , for a large range of redshifts .",
    "furthermore , it fits the behavior of the @xmath1 field across equality , with quite a small discrepancy from the numerical solution , keeping mostly well below @xmath29 .",
    "let be @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , @xmath25 : equality scale factor , time ) ; it is easy to verify that the expression @xmath33 gives the scale factor behavior before , during and after equality .",
    "this follows the integration of the friemann equation @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ; @xmath36 are matter and radiation energy densities at equality ) and noticing that @xmath37 .",
    "it is then also easy to see that @xmath38 so that , clearly , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) for @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .    let us now rewrite eq .",

    "let then be @xmath52 although this means that also @xmath53 depends on @xmath47 and , therefore , the expressions ( [ deriva ] ) should contain further terms .",
    "the @xmath47 dependence of @xmath54 arises from the @xmath47 dependence of @xmath55 ; should we neglect the former one , the last term in the expression ( [ gm1 ] ) should be consistently omitted .    in the next section",
    "we shall compare the behavior of @xmath1 , as obtained from the expressions ( [ newtra ] ) , ( [ gm1 ] ) , ( [ bye ] ) , denominated gt , with a numerical solution of eq .",

    "the symmetry between rt and mt solution is only apparent .",
    "dotted curves are symmetric in respect to @xmath72 , and this means that at such redshift , inside the matter dominated era , the rt solution still performs as well as the mt solution . using the expressions ( [ radtra ] ) and ( [ mattra ] ) it is easy to see that the two solutions intersect for @xmath73 _ i.e. _ , for @xmath74 and this confirms what is shown by the plot .    -3.5truecm",
    "-3.2truecm    altogether , this means that a fair tracker solution , since @xmath75 , can only be given by using the gt expression , holding until de itself begins to play a significant role as a source of the cosmic expansion .",

    "its @xmath78 dependence is plotted in figure [ dphimax ] .",
    "tracker solutions play an important role in the analysis of dde cosmologies . a good tracker solution for the radiation dominated regime",
    "can be easily given . a tracker solution for the matter dominated regime also exists , but its usual analytical expression is rather far from a fair numerical behavior .",
    "here we gave a fair solution performing as well as the usual one in the radiation dominated era , fitting the numerical solution also about the equality ( the residual discrepancy approaches @xmath79 just in a narrow interval ) and fitting the numerical solution all through the matter dominated era .",

    "when initial conditions to any numerical problem are to be set , one usually needs to go back to the radiation dominated era , so to rely on a fair tracking . as an example of problems where initial conditions in the matter dominated era are useful ,",
