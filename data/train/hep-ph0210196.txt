    "in this talk i summarize salient features of the results of four different investigations .",
    "small departures from the standard assumptions of the sm and the mssm are the common feature unifying all of them .",
    "the results presented are based on four abstracts  @xcite submitted to this meeting .",
    "supersymmetry and models for non - zero @xmath5 masses indeed form a very big part of all the current beyond the standard model ( bsm ) discussions . in this talk",
    "i refer to the effects of relaxing two of the assumptions normally made : that of universal gaugino masses  @xcite and @xmath6 conservation  @xcite",
    ".  susy provides one of the most economical ways of generating non - zero @xmath5 masses . in the last abstract  @xcite a new aspect of the collider signatures of the heavy majorana neutrino , an important ingredient of all the models of @xmath5 masses not involving  susy , is presented",
    "mssm assumes universal masses for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 gauginos at the high scale .",
    "this implies @xmath9 at the electroweak scale , where @xmath10 are the @xmath11 gaugino masses .",
    "however , this assumption need not be true even in the very restrictive msugra model wherein the non - universality is possible for a non - minimal kinetic term for the gauge superfields .",
    "non - universal gaugino masses are expected also in models with anomaly - mediated susy breaking ( amsb ) or moduli - dominated susy breaking . in general , therefore , we can expect @xmath12 with @xmath13 at the ew scale .",
    "we studied the effect of such a scenario on the ` invisible ' decays of the @xmath14 .",
    "a ratio @xmath15 between the two gaugino masses at the ew scale needs m_1 = 2 r m_2 [ m1m2 ] at the gut scale .",
    "most of the above - mentioned models normally imply values of @xmath16 . taking a phenomenological approach ,",
    "however , we consider two values of @xmath17 , viz . @xmath18 . as a result of such a non - universality , for a given @xmath19 mass ,",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 is smaller than that in the universal case .",
    "hence it is possible to have @xmath20 while respecting all the lep constraints , in spite of the theoretical upper limit of @xmath21 gev on the mass of the lightest @xmath14 among the susy higgses .",
    "of course it is necessary to rework  @xcite all the lep constraints for the non - universal case .",
    "( @xmath22 is maximized for moderate @xmath23 , small @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "unlike the case of universal gaugino masses , we found large regions of the @xmath25@xmath24 plane where b.r .",
    "for the ` invisible ' , @xmath26 decay mode can be as large as @xmath27 _ even _",
    "after all the lep constraints are imposed , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "for @xmath28 along with the lep constraints on the @xmath29 mass indicated by the black region .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 gev . ]    [ fig1 ]    such a large ` invisible ' branching ratio for the @xmath14 decreases that into the @xmath32 and @xmath33 channels .",
    "the latter indeed provide the best possible signature for the @xmath14 produced ` inclusively ' and in association with a @xmath34 .",
    "if we define , @xmath35 and @xmath36 similarly , we find that @xmath37 thus b.r.@xmath38@xmath39 can mean loss of the signal for the lightest higgs at the lhc .",
    "a light @xmath40 also has implications for the relic density of the neutralinos in the universe , as the latter is decided by @xmath41 . for a light @xmath0 , the @xmath42-mediated @xmath43 channel process contributes to the annihilation .",
    "if the @xmath44 is light the cross - section also receives a contribution from the @xmath45-channel @xmath44 exchange .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the expected ` invisible ' branching ratio for the @xmath14 and the relic density of the @xmath0 as the same couplings are involved .",
    "for @xmath28 along with the dm and lep constraints .",
    "the white region corresponds to @xmath46 , for @xmath47 gev , @xmath30 and @xmath31 gev .",
    "the black region is the lep - excluded region .",
    "the lightly ( heavily ) shaded region corresponds to @xmath48 . ]",
    "[ fig2 ]    figure  [ fig2 ] shows results obtained for @xmath49 with @xmath30 and @xmath50 gev  @xcite using the micromegas  @xcite program to calculate the relic density .",
    "these show that the requirement of an acceptable relic density does constrain the @xmath25@xmath24 plane quite substantially",
    ". however , there exist large regions of this plane where the ` invisible ' branching ratio of @xmath14 is as large as @xmath51@xmath52 , even for ` large ' @xmath53 gev ) @xmath44 , consistent with the lep constraints and with an acceptable relic density .",
    "the small mass of the @xmath0 in this case means that the trilepton signal at the tevatron will be qualitatively different from the universal case .",
    "thus this scenario can be tested at the tevatron via the trilepton events . as a matter of fact",
    ", one can also obtain a model - independent limit on @xmath54 and hence on the @xmath0 mass , by considerations of relic density .",
    "@xmath55 are symmetries of the sm but not of the mssm ; i.e. it is possible to write terms in the lagrangian which are ,  but respect gauge invariance as well as supersymmetry .",
    "non - zero @xmath5 masses can be generated in  supersymmetric theories , without introducing any new fields ; at the tree level via the bilinear  terms in the superpotential and quantum one or two loop level via the trilinear @xmath56 couplings  @xcite .",
    "a large number of these couplings are constrained by low energy processes , cosmological arguments as well as explicit collider searches  @xcite .",
    "some of the strongest constraints on the @xmath57 processes come from @xmath5 masses . as said earlier , since the heavy scale involved in the mass - generation mechanism is decided by the sparticle masses , this leads to constraints on the size of the  couplings and hence to clear predictions of the ,   signals in collider processes involving these sparticles . since some of the constraints do depend on the details of the specific susy model , it is important to study the direct effect of the _ very same _ couplings that are so indirectly constrained , at the colliders .",
    "such studies can help clarify the picture for model building .",
    "the main constraints on  couplings @xmath56 with more than one third - generation index come from models for @xmath5 masses and not from collider experiments .",
    "probes of these  couplings at the colliders involve studying the physics of third - generation fermions .",
    "the third generation sfermions are also likely to give rise to larger virtual effects , as they are expected to be lighter than those of the first two generations . for @xmath58 with masses of interest at the lhc and nlc , final states with third - generation fermions including @xmath45",
    "are possible .",
    "one thus needs a study of the  decays of @xmath59 retaining effects of the mass of the third generation fermions , for @xmath60-violating coupling .",
    "an interesting example is the resonant or non - resonant production of the @xmath61 via the @xmath62 coupling in @xmath63 , similar to the case of @xmath64 production via the yukawa coupling . even for @xmath62 as small as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the rates are appreciable .",
    "the @xmath61 thus produced will have both @xmath6-conserving decay @xmath67 for @xmath68 and the @xmath6-violating one @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "the final state composition will depend on the  decays of the @xmath0 as well .",
    "production of @xmath61 through  couplings and its decay via the _ same _ will give rise to @xmath71 , which is the same as the expected final state for the @xmath72 production .",
    "thus the @xmath61 in this case can fake the @xmath72 signal .",
    "@xmath6 conserving decays of the @xmath61 and  decays of the @xmath0 can also produce @xmath73 in the latter case the final state has the tell - tale signature of , the like - sign fermion pairs .",
    "we calculated  @xcite the three - body decays of the lsp for dominant  trilinear couplings and obtained explicit expressions for the most general case of complex mass matrices , including the effect of the mass of the third - generation fermions .",
    "of course the results depend on the @xmath60@xmath74 mixing in the sfermion sector , gaugino  higgsino mixing and @xmath23 , as well as on the generation structure of the particular  couplings that is large .",
    "one can have the ` massive ' and ` massless ' modes with / without a @xmath45 in the final state .",
    "[ fig3 ]    figure  [ fig3 ] shows the results for the case with @xmath62 dominant , for two different choices of @xmath60@xmath74 mixing in the squark sector and different composition of the @xmath40 .",
    "the massive decay mode has a large width for low @xmath23 and large higgsino  gaugino mixing .",
    "otherwise the massless mode is larger , although the massive mode is non - negligible . even for smaller but dominant , @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings , with more than one third - generation index ,",
    "the three - body   decays of @xmath58 can have important phenomenological consequences for new particle searches at the future colliders .    in the above discussion the bilinear  terms",
    "were assumed to be zero . in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , a particular case of non - zero @xmath75 is considered . the  and @xmath6-conserving decays of the @xmath76 in this case are given by eqs .",
    "( [ rpvd ] ) and ( [ rpcd ] ) respectively . @xmath77 and _ 2 ^ 0 _ 1 ^ 0 ^+ ^- , _",
    "1^_1 ^ 0 _ .",
    "[ rpcd ] it is clear the   decays will enhance the number of leptons in the final state and give very clear signals .",
    "these authors analysed , in an msugra picture , the multilepton signals at the tevatron .",
    "the multilepton signal is one of the promising channel for discovery of susy at the tevatron .",
    "hence such an analysis is important .",
    "this one shows that the reach in the multilepton channel for the  case is much better than for the @xmath6-conserving case at large values of @xmath78 . for small @xmath78 the situation",
    "is reversed , owing to slepton - mediated @xmath79 decay .",
    "the authors  @xcite consider models of @xmath5 masses which have an isosinglet neutrino @xmath80 that mixes with the ordinary light one but wherein the mass and the mixing of the @xmath80 are not linked together , unlike in the usual models based on he see - saw mechanism .",
    "this mixing is then treated as a phenomenological parameter constrained by the lep data .",
    "it is possible in these models to have @xmath80 mass ` naturally ' in the range : @xmath81 gev  @xcite .",
    "the issue of characteristic  signals for the hmn via like sign dilepton ( lsd ) events . was revisited in this investigation .",
    "they considered both the fusion contribution from q_i + |q_j q_k + |q_l + w^+ * + w ^+ * q_k + |q_l + l^+ + l ^+ where the @xmath80 is exchanged in the @xmath45 channel and also from the resonant production of @xmath80 via @xmath82 explicit formulae were obtained in helicity formalism and errors in the earlier calculations  @xcite , traced to dropping of the ghost diagrams , were corrected . the predicted lsd cross - section increases by about @xmath83 as a result of this .",
    "the reach of the lhc , just from rates , is @xmath84@xmath85 gev .",
    "detailed simulations will be needed to make these conclusions firmer , as the cuts can then be optimized .",
