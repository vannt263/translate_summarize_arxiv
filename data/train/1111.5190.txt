    "in this letter , we will focus on holographic qcd from d4 branes .",
    "we will discuss some problems with the usual correspondence between the confinement / deconfinement transition in qcd and the scherk - schwarz transition between a solitonic d4 brane and a black d4 brane in the gravity dual .",
    "some of these problems were first discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will specifically show that the black d4 brane can not be identified with the ( strong coupling continuation of the ) deconfinement phase in qcd in four dimensions . as a resolution of these problems",
    ", we will propose an alternative scenario in which the confinement / deconfinement transition corresponds to a gregory - laflamme transition @xcite between a uniformly distributed soliton and a localized soliton in the iib frame .",
    "the scenario we propose suggests that we need to reconsider several previous results in holographic qcd including phenomena related to the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will review the construction of four dimensional @xmath0 pure yang - mills theory ( ym4 ) from @xmath1 d4 branes @xcite .",
    "let us first consider a 10 dimensional euclidean spacetime with an @xmath2 and consider d4 branes wrapping on the @xmath2 .",
    "we define the coordinate along this @xmath2 as @xmath3 and its periodicity as @xmath4 .",
    "the effective theory on this brane is a 5 dimensional supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym5 ) on the @xmath5 . for the fermions on the brane",
    ", the boundary condition along the circle can be ap ( antiperiodic ) or p ( periodic ) ; to specify the theory , we must pick one of these two boundary conditions .",
    "let us take the ap boundary condition .",
    "this gives rise to fermion masses proportional to the kaluza - klein scale @xmath6 , leading to supersymmetry breaking ( this is called the ss  scherk - schwarz mechanism ) .",
    "this , in turn , induces masses for the adjoint scalars and for @xmath7 , which are proportional to @xmath8 at one - loop .",
    "therefore , if @xmath9 is sufficiently small and the dynamical scale @xmath10 and temperature are much less than both the above mass scales , then the fermions , adjoint scalars and kk modes are decoupled and the 5 dimensional supersymmetric yang - mills theory is reduced to a four dimensional pure yang - mills theory .",
    "the precise conditions to obtain ym4 from sym5 are @xmath11    by taking the large @xmath1 ( maldacena ) limit of this system @xcite at low temperatures , we obtain the dual gravity description of the compactified 5 dimensional sym theory @xcite , which consists , at low temperatures , of a solitonic d@xmath12 brane solution wrapping the @xmath5 .",
    "the explicit metric is given by @xmath13 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "& f_4(u)=1-\\left ( \\frac{u_0}{u}\\right)^3 , \\quad e^{\\phi}=\\frac{\\lambda_5}{(2\\pi)^2n } \\left(\\frac{u^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{d_5 \\lambda_5 } }   \\right)^{1/2 } , \\quad u_0=\\frac{\\pi \\lambda_4}{9 l_4 } ,     \\label{metric - sd4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this gravity solution is not always valid .",
    "e.g. in order that the stringy modes can be ignored , we should ensure that the curvature in string units must be small @xcite .",
    "this condition turns out to be equivalent to @xmath16 this is opposite to the condition ( [ gauge - cond ] ) .",
    "thus , the gravity solution can describe sym5 but can not directly describe ym4 .",
    "this is a common problem in the construction of holographic duals of non - supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "however , in principle , leading order effects of stringy modes can be computed by perturbatively evaluating @xmath17 corrections in the gravity theory and , as in case of the standard strong coupling expansion in gauge theory ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , we may obtain appropriate weak coupling results , _ provided no phase transition occurs between the weak and strong coupling regimes_. although the gravity solution ( [ metric - sd4 ] ) is just the leading term of such an expansion , we should be able to infer qualitative properties of the gauge theory by extrapolating .",
    "many interesting results , including the qualitative predictions in @xcite , have been obtained using this prescription",
    ". we will proceed to describe the thermodynamics of yang - mills theory from gravity in this spirit .",
    "in this section we investigate the thermodynamic phase structure of the gravity solutions and compare the result with the phase structure of pure yang - mills theory . to discuss holographic qcd at finite temperatures ,",
    "we begin by compactifying euclidean time in the boundary theory on a circle with periodicity @xmath18 . in order to determine the gravitational theory , we need to fix the periodicity of fermions in the gauge theory along the time cycle .",
    "let us recall that the gauge theory of interest here is pure yang mills theory in four dimensions , which does not have fermions .",
    "fermions reappear when the validity condition of the gravity description ( [ gravity - cond - sd4 ] ) is enforced and @xmath10 goes above the kk scale @xmath6 . in this sense , fermions are an artifact of the holographic method and in the region of validity of the pure ym theory , the periodicity of the fermion should not affect the gauge theory results .    indeed we can obtain the thermal partition function of ym4 from sym5 on @xmath19 with either the ( ap , ap ) or ( p , ap ) boundary condition here and elsewhere the boundary conditions will always refer to those of the boundary theory along @xmath20 , respectively . ] : @xmath21 where the limit ensures that the fermions and adjoint scalars are decoupled because of large mass . since we recover pure ym4 in both cases , it is pertinent to study gravity solutions corresponding to both these boundary conditions .    the gravity solutions appearing in the ( ap , ap ) case @xcite are summarized as @xmath22 here the metric of the black d4 solution is given by @xmath23 , ~~ u_0=\\frac{\\pi \\lambda_4 l_4}{9\\beta^2 }    \\label{metric - bd4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this metric is related to the solitonic d4 brane ( [ metric - sd4 ] ) through the @xmath24 symmetry : @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the free energies of these solutions are coincident at the self - dual point @xmath26 and a phase transition called scherk - schwarz transition happens there . in ( [ table - apap ] ) ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the polyakov loop operators : @xmath29 vacuum expectation values of these operators characterize the phases of the gauge theory .",
    "these also act as order parameters for the @xmath30 ` centre symmetry ' ( see @xcite for details ) and their vanishing is related to large-@xmath1 volume independence @xcite .",
    "the gravity solutions appearing in the ( p , ap ) case are @xmath31 note that we need to take a t - dual along the temporal @xmath32 circle and go to the iib frame to see the high temperature region , since the masses of the winding modes of the iia string wrapping along the temporal circle become light when @xmath33 .",
    "this t - dual maps the solitonic d4 solution in the iia to solitonic d3 branes uniformly smeared along the dual temporal circle in the iib , with metric given by @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{metric - ssd3 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath35 is the dual of @xmath36 , hence @xmath37 has a periodicity @xmath38 .",
    "this uniform configuration becomes meta - stable above a critical temperature @xmath39 , and the solitonic d3 branes get localized on the dual temporal circle .",
    "this phase transition is a gregory - laflamme ( gl ) type transition @xcite .",
    "the metric of the localized solitonic d3 brane is approximately described in @xcite .",
    "the phases in the 4 dimensional pure yang - mills theory are @xmath40 here @xmath28 makes an appearance because ym4 is viewed as a limit of sym5",
    ". that @xmath41 follows from the fact that kk reduction from sym5 to ym4 only works in this phase ; in the phase with vanishing @xmath28 the thermodynamics is independent of @xmath4 ( through the large @xmath1 volume independence mentioned above ) and can not describe the kk reduction .",
    "note , further , that the above table works for either p or ap boundary condition for the sym5 fermions along the temporal circle , as we argued in ( [ 4d - limit ] ) .",
    "let us now compare this phase structure in yang - mills theory with the one found above for gravity . in the low temperature regime ,",
    "the properties of the polyakov loop operators in the solitonic d4 brane agree with those of the confinement phase . thus these two phases may be identified . in the high temperature regime",
    ", it is the localized d3 soliton which matches the deconfinement phase in terms of properties of @xmath27 and @xmath28 whereas the black d4 brane solution does not .",
    "this , in particular , means that the @xmath30 symmetry is realized in the same was in the localized d3 soliton phase as in the deconfinement phase , whereas it is realized differently in the black d4 solution .",
    "thus the localized d3 solution may correspond to the deconfinement phase but the black d4 brane does not .",
    "indeed the expected phase structures of sym5 with the ( ap , ap ) and ( p , ap ) boundary condition are shown in figure [ fig - d4-phase ] . in the ( ap , ap ) case , at least one phase transition has to occur between the black d4 brane solution and the deconfinement phase .",
    "( this is also expected through the @xmath24 symmetry : @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite . )",
    "therefore the previous conjecture that the black d4 brane corresponds to the deconfinement phase of the yang - mills theory is not correct , since these two phases are not smoothly connected ( see the remarks below in _ italics _ ) .",
    "by contrast ,",
    "in the ( p , ap ) case , the gravity solutions in the strong coupling regime may smoothly continue to the phases of the weakly coupled 4 dimensional yang mills theory .",
    "thus we propose that we should look at these gravity solutions in the ( p , ap ) case to investigate the dynamics of the yang - mills theory .",
    "especially the gl transition between the smeared d3 soliton and the localized d3 soliton would correspond to the confinement / deconfinement transition in the yang - mills theory where d4 branes are replaced by d1 branes .",
    "this provides support for the proposal presented in this paper . ] .     with the ( ap , ap ) and ( p , ap ) boundary condition .",
    "the gravity analysis is valid in the strong coupling region ( the blue region ) .",
    "the 4 dimensional ym description is valid in the upper green region , see ( [ gauge - cond ] ) .",
    "the lower green region in the ( ap , ap ) case is the mirror of the upper one via the @xmath24 symmetry @xmath25 .",
    "the solid black lines correspond to a minimal extrapolation of the phase boundaries through the intermediate region .",
    "the dotted line denotes another possible phase transition which is allowed by the @xmath24 symmetry . ]",
    "our proposal opens up the interesting possibility of a relation between the gl transition and the hagedorn transition .",
    "it is known that the gl instability is an instability of the kk modes of the graviton along the compact circle @xcite ( such modes develop an imaginary frequency and grow exponentially ) . in our case ,",
    "the kk modes along the dual temporal circle , which cause the gl instability in the iib description , would be mapped to winding modes around the temporal circle through the t - duality @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the gl transition is associated with the tachyonic instability of the winding modes of the iia string .",
    "this is similar to the hagedorn transition in string theory @xcite , where the temporal winding modes cause the instability .",
    "thus the gl transition in the iib description might correspond to the hagedorn transition in the iia description .",
    "note that on the gauge theory side also , the confinement / deconfinement transition has been shown to be related to the hagedorn transition @xcite .",
    "this makes it plausible that the hagedorn transition in the yang - mills theory continues to the hagedorn transition in the iia string , which , as we argued above , is possibly the dual of the gl transition in the iib supergravity .",
    "in this study , we showed that the identification between the deconfinement phase and the black d4 brane solution in the ( ap , ap ) boundary condition is not correct and proposed a resolution by using the ( p , ap ) boundary condition .",
    "this result suggests that we need to reconsider several previous results , in which the black d4 brane was employed in high temperature holographic qcd including the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite .",
    "one important ingredient in the sakai - sugimoto model is the mechanism of chiral symmetry restoration at high temperatures @xcite . in @xcite , we proposed a new mechanism for chiral symmetry restoration in our framework .",
    "another important issue is to explore what geometry corresponds to the deconfinement phase in the real time formalism ; this is important , e.g. , for the investigation of the viscosity ratio .",
    "problems similar to the above had also been encountered in the study of two dimensional bosonic gauge theory in @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the issues addressed in this paper are rather general in the discussion of holography for non - supersymmetric gauge theories at finite temperatures .",
