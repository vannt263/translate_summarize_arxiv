    ", this pulsar has exhibited regular glitches with giant jumps of the angular velocity of order @xmath1 .",
    "these spin - ups have been generally attributed to the sudden unpinning of neutron superfluid vortices in the inner crust of the neutron star  @xcite ( see , e.g. section 12.4 of ref .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the vortex - mediated glitch scenario has been recently challenged  @xcite by the realization that despite the absence of viscous drag the neutron superfluid is still strongly coupled to the neutron - star crust due to bragg scattering  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been argued that the crustal superfluid may carry enough angular momentum to explain vela glitches invoking the lack of knowledge of the dense - matter equation of state ( eos )  @xcite .",
    "however , the eoss employed in these analyses are not thermodynamically consistent , and more importantly , they are found to be incompatible with existing constraints from laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations . in particular , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite determined the eos of neutron stars using a relativistic mean - field model for the core , and the model of baym , pethick and sutherland ( bps ) for the outer crust  @xcite .",

    "in addition , the symmetric nuclear - matter incompressibility coefficient at saturation predicted by nl3max , @xmath6  mev , lies outside the range of values inferred from isoscalar giant monopole resonances in finite nuclei ( see , e.g. ref .",

    "the extent to which giant pulsar glitches can be explained by the superfluid in neutron - star crusts is more closely examined given the current uncertainties on dense - matter properties .",
    "to this end , we have employed a set of different unified eoss . treating all regions of a neutron star within",
    "the same nuclear model ensures that the resulting eoss are thermodynamically consistent .",

    "giant pulsar glitches as observed in vela are generally thought to arise from sudden transfers of angular momentum between the neutron superfluid permeating the neutron - star crust and the rest of the star .",

    ", we shall compute the moments of inertia assuming that the superfluid is corotating with the rest of star , i.e. neglecting the small difference @xmath45 .",
    "the stress energy - density tensor will thus be taken to be that of a perfect fluid : t_ab = ( + p ) u_a u_b + p g_ab , where @xmath46 is the mass - energy density , @xmath47 the pressure , @xmath48 the metric and @xmath49 the @xmath50-velocity of the fluid normalized as @xmath51 .",

    "even though two different codes were used to calculate the eos in the outer crust and in the inner crust , the pressure ( energy per nucleon ) at the boundary was found to differ by less than 3% ( 5% ) thus ensuring a thermodynamically consistent description of the eos  @xcite .",
    "deeper in the star , the core is described by the eos of homogeneous beta - equilibrated matter made of nucleons and leptons ( including muons at high density ) .",
    "the crust - core transition can be determined by the instability of such homogeneous matter against density fluctuations .",
    "the transition density and pressure were calculated by the method described in ref.@xcite , which was shown to be extremely accurate  @xcite .    in this way , unified eoss for neutron stars were calculated using the latest series of brussels - montreal ( bsk ) edfs .",

    "a number of additional constraints were imposed to the brussels - montreal edfs : i ) the incompressibility @xmath103 of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation was required to fall in the empirical range @xmath104  mev @xcite , ii ) the isoscalar effective mass in symmetric nuclear matter at saturation was fixed to the realistic value of @xmath105 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary of the experimental and theoretical evidence ) , iii ) the parameters of the interactions were adjusted so as to limit the occurence of spurious spin and spin - isospin instabilities , and in particular to prevent a ferromagnetic collapse of neutron stars .",
    "although the brussels - montreal edfs were not directly fitted to realistic eos of symmetric nuclear matter , they are compatible with the constraints inferred from the analysis of heavy - ion collision experiments  @xcite . besides , the predicted values for the symmetry energy @xmath101 and its slope @xmath12 at saturation are consistent with those inferred from from various experimental and theoretical constraints  @xcite . finally , the isovector effective mass was found to be smaller than the isoscalar effective mass at the saturation density .",
    "this result is consistent with measurements of isovector giant resonances  @xcite , and microscopic calculations  @xcite .",

    "the sly eos does not actually provide a fully consistent description of neutron stars : indeed , the eos of the outer crust was not calculated using the same edf , but was taken from ref .",
    "the reason may lie in the fact that hfb calculations using the sly4  @xcite edf that underlies the sly eos , yields a rather poor fit to experimental nuclear masses , with a root - mean - square deviation ( considering only even - even nuclei ) of about 5.1 mev  @xcite .",

    "the inferred mass of the vela pulsar is at most @xmath120 .",
    "such a low mass challenges the current scenarios of neutron - star formation ( see , e.g. , section 3.3 in ref .",
    "@xcite for a short review ) .",
    "although neutron stars with a mass @xmath121 might be produced via fragmentation , they are not expected to be seen as ordinary radio pulsars ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "besides , the comparison of neutron - star cooling simulations with the observational estimates of the age and thermal luminosity of the vela pulsar suggests that this neutron star is rather massive ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "the glitch puzzle still remains considering the current uncertainties in the dense - matter eos .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that the average baryon number density inferred at the center of vela is rather low , _ at most _",
    "@xmath122  @xmath9 depending on the eos . at such densities ,",
    "the neutron - star core is generally expected to contain nucleons and leptons only ( see , e.g. ref .  @xcite and references therein ) , and the dense - matter eos is fairly well constrained by laboratory experiments , especially heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .    in this analysis",
    ", we considered that the fractional moments of inertia @xmath107 and @xmath106 are the same for all eoss , as in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "although the threshold density for the onset of the neutron - drip transition is model - dependent , the variations are quite small ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the ensuying changes in @xmath78 are expected to be negligible since @xmath78 is mainly determined by the inertia of the denser regions of the inner crust . ignoring the model dependence of @xmath107 and @xmath106 seems also to be a reasonable approximation in view of the published results for the effective neutron mass in the inner crust of a neutron star  @xcite . for consistency and completeness ,",
    "we have computed the global structure of rotating neutron stars using the unified eos constructed from bsk14 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : icrust_bsk ] , bsk14 yields similar results for the ratio @xmath116 as those obtained with the more recent brussels - montreal edf bsk26 , as well as with the sly eos .",
    "since the assumption of slow rotation may underestimate @xmath116 , we have assessed the validity of this approximation for the eos based on bsk24 using the _ rns _ code .",
    "we have calculated different models of neutron stars varying the central density and the ratio of the polar to equatorial coordinate radius @xmath123 . for neutron stars with a spin parameter @xmath124 below @xmath125",
    "we have reduced the polynomial order of the expansion in the _ rns _ code to @xmath126 , since higher orders contributed only numerical noise as in ref .",
    "we chose a grid of @xmath127 in the compactified coordinate plane @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "a further increase of the grid size did not yield any improvements . as a consistency check of the numerical method",
    ", we have calculated the total angular momentum via the two ways described in section  [ sec : constraint ] .",
    "the results have been found to deviate by less than @xmath129 for neutron - stars with a mass exceeding @xmath130 , which is in accordance with previous comparative studies @xcite .",
    "thus , an accuracy of approximately that order must be accepted for local quantities like @xmath131 , too .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : icrustratio_bsk24 ] , we exemplify the behavior of @xmath131 for four different masses and varying frequency of the neutron star .",
    "indeed , this ratio increases with the spin rate of the pulsar . taking as an example the fastest spinning pulsar ( psr j1748 - 2446ad ) known to date with a rotation frequency @xmath132 of about @xmath133hz @xcite , the relative difference of the slow - rotation approximation and the numerical results are between @xmath134 for a @xmath135 star and @xmath136 for a @xmath137 star , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : icrustratio_bsk24 ] .",
    "in contrast , the slow - rotation approximation is very accurate for stars spinning as slow as vela ( @xmath138hz ) , for which the relative difference to the results obtained with the _ rns _ code is far below the numerical noise limit of @xmath129 .",
    "nonetheless , the fits shown in fig .  [ fig : icrustratio_bsk24 ] include already terms from an expansion in @xmath139 to the fourth order .",
    "in fact , the highest order is only relevant , i.e. above the numerical noise limit , for the @xmath137 stars ( @xmath140 contribution ) .",
    "the fits reproduce also the results of the slow rotation approximation with an accuracy of @xmath141 , which corroborates the expected accuracy regime .",
    ", as obtained using the unified equation of state based on the energy - density functional bsk24  @xcite .",
    "results are shown for four different neutron - star masses : @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 solar masses , respectively ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "the points represent the actual numerical results and the curves are polynomial fits up to the fourth order . ]",
    "we have computed the global structure of rotating neutron stars , both in full general relativity and in the slow - rotation approximation . for this purpose ,",
    "we have employed a series of unified eoss , treating consistently all regions of a neutron star .",
    "the brussels - montreal unified eoss presented in ref .",
    "@xcite are all based on the very accurately calibrated edfs bsk22 - 26 spanning the current uncertainties in the nuclear symmetry energy as well as in the high - density stiffness of the neutron - matter eos  @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "we have also considered the unified eos based on bsk14  @xcite ( for which crustal entrainment was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , bsk20 - 21  @xcite , sly  @xcite and bcpm  @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "we find that the neutron superfluid permeating the inner crust of a neutron star does not carry enough angular momentum to explain the giant frequency glitches observed in the vela pulsar .",
    "the glitch puzzle is not restricted to vela , but concerns other glitching pulsars . on the other hand ,",
    "the statistical errors are much larger due to the smaller number of observed glitches  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the analyses of the 2007 glitch detected in psr j1119@xmath06127 , as well as of the 2010 glitch in psr  2334@xmath26 lead to even larger fractional moments of inertia of the crust than for vela  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the constraint @xmath146 inferred from the glitch in psr j1119@xmath06127 can not be fulfilled by the crustal superfluid . indeed , inserting @xmath147 and @xmath148  @xcite thus yields @xmath149 .",
    "our study suggests that the neutron superfluid in the core of a neutron star plays a more important role than previously thought .",
    "the pinning of neutron superfluid vortices to magnetic flux tubes opens promising perspectives for unravelling the origin of giant glitches  @xcite .",
    "this scenario could be independently tested by the search for gravitational waves associated with glitch events  @xcite .",

    "<S> giant pulsar frequency glitches as detected in the emblematic vela pulsar have long been thought to be the manifestation of a neutron superfluid permeating the inner crust of a neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> however , this superfluid has been recently found to be entrained by the crust , and as a consequence it does not carry enough angular momentum to explain giant glitches . </S>",
    "<S> the extent to which pulsar - timing observations can be reconciled with the standard vortex - mediated glitch theory is studied considering the current uncertainties on dense - matter properties . to this end , the crustal moment of inertia of glitching pulsars is calculated employing a series of different unified dense - matter equations of state . </S>"
