    ".8truecm    one of the most fascinating aspects of classical field theory is the existence of travelling localized solutions of the non - linear equations describing physical systems : these _ solitons _ find application in a very broad class of physical problems . from the quantum field theory point of view , ( being exact non - perturbative solutions of the classical theory ) they are believed to carry information about the non - perturbative structure of the quantum theory .",
    "their particle - like properties have an intuitive and reasonable interpretation as bound states of the elementary excitations of the corresponding quantum field theory . for specific two - dimensional models",
    "this idea was confirmed by explicit computations in the framework of the semiclassical approximation @xcite , of quantum inverse scattering @xcite and of other systematic expansions @xcite while , in more recent years , conformal field theory techniques have led to exact results for the @xmath0matrix @xcite .",
    "solitons also play fundamental role in recent non - perturbative developments of qft ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) , since they are seen as the `` duals '' of the elementary excitations appearing in the original lagrangian @xcite .",
    "solitons made their appearance in a completely different context some years ago , namely in low - energy phenomenological applications to physical systems confined to a plane .",
    "an interesting class of gauge theoretical models , describing non - relativistic matter coupled to a chern - simons gauge field , was introduced by jackiw and pi @xcite to obtain a simple realization of non - relativistic interacting anyons . for an appropriate choice of the self - interaction potential , in the static case",
    ", one can reduce the euler - lagrange equations to the completely integrable toda equation ( in the non - abelian situation ) or liouville ( in the abelian one ) @xcite , with well - known soliton solutions .",
    "the dynamics of the system corresponds , in this case , to a dimensional reduction in time : recently @xcite there has been instead considered a reduction in one spatial dimension .",
    "the physical reason lies in the hope that some characteristic of the model , in particular its fractional statistics , can be maintained by the related one - dimensional excitations and that , by a suitable modification , chiral behaviour can be induced .",
    "these two features are in fact relevant in the phenomenological description of the edge states in the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the theory obtained in this way , originally proposed in @xcite , partially fails to achieve its goal , because as was shown in @xcite no statistical transmutation arises for non - relativistic matter . on the other hand ,",
    "as first observed in @xcite , a novel and interesting soliton structure is present there , finding its origin in the gauge coupling and in the chiral modification .",
    "our investigation is a direct follow - up of the work begun in @xcite , and it is particularly devoted to the classical and quantum analysis of the solitons appearing in the theory . actually , after realizing that the symmetry property of the original model is shared by a larger class of @xmath1 dimensional theories , we have chosen to study a slight generalization of the model of @xcite , that fits equally well into the dimensional reduction procedure .",
    "surprisingly , as we shall see , quantum effects naturally lead one to include the more general interactions that we have introduced . as in the analogous @xmath2-dimensional family",
    ", integrability appears only for a suitable choice of the initial parameters ( as observed in @xcite ) , relating our system to the derivative non - linear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless soliton solutions exist for any value of the coupling constants .",
    "we start in sect . 2 by describing the dimensional reduction of the jackiw - pi model and its modification , based essentially on the introduction of a chiral boson .",
    "the gauge action turns out to be of @xmath3 type and we show that the system is equivalent to a general family of non - linear schrdinger equations that do not possess galilean invariance . in absence of a self - interaction potential for the matter , the model has non - relativistic scale invariance , an important ingredient in understanding some features of the theory : a suitable potential respecting the scale invariance can also be added .",
    "we discuss the conserved charges and we derive , from symmetry considerations , some general properties of localized classical solution . in sect .",
    "3 we compute the solitons , first without and then including a potential , and we discuss their properties : in particular they appear to be chiral , existing only for a fixed sign of the total momentum , and presenting an interesting particle - like behaviour , inherited from the scale invariance .",
    "we also consider finite energy solutions with non - vanishing boundary condition at ( spatial ) infinity ( dark solitons ) , that possess opposite chirality with respect to the previous ones .",
    "we show that conserved charges must be carefully defined when non - trivial boundary conditions are present and we derive the relevant energy - momentum dispersion relation . in sect.4",
    ", we discuss the quantization of the theory , paying particular attention to the relation between the solitons and the quantum bound states .",
    "since the system is non - integrable for a generic choice of the coupling constants , it is difficult to obtain exact results , and we have explicitly solved the schrdinger equation only for the two - body problem . nevertheless we have obtained a perturbative solution , consistent with the bohr - sommerfield quantization of the solitons ( in the weak - coupling limit ) and the exact expression of the trace anomaly of the theory , showing that classical scale invariance is destroyed , except at the fixed point of the renormalization group , represented by dnls . combining this result with the semiclassical quantization of the soliton , we conjecture the general form of the energy for the @xmath4-body bound - state . finally , in sect .",
    "5 we present our conclusion and indicate future directions .",
    "a nonrelativistic gauge field theory that leads to planar anyons @xcite is the nonlinear schrdinger equation , gauged by a chern - simons field and governed by the lagrange density @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the schrdinger quantum field , giving rise to charged bosonic particles after second quantization .",
    "@xmath7 possesses no propagating degrees of freedom ; it can be eliminated , leaving a statistical aharonov - bohm interaction between the particles .",
    "@xmath8 describes possible nonlinear self - interactions , and can be a general polynomial in the density @xmath9 .",
    "we notice that the above lagrangian is invariant under galilean transformations , due to the topological nature of the chern - simons action . when analyzing the lineal problem @xcite , it is natural to consider a dimensional reduction of ( [ eq:1 ] ) , by suppressing dependence on the second spatial coordinate , renaming @xmath10 as @xmath11 and redefining the gauge field as @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in this way one",
    "is led to a @xmath14@xmath15 gauge theory coupled to a non - relativistic bosonic field in @xmath1 dimensions : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is dimensionless and we have neglected @xmath18 since it is a total spatial derivative .",
    "eliminating the @xmath14 and @xmath19 fields decouples them completely , in the sense that the phase of @xmath6 may be adjusted so that the interactions of the @xmath6 field are solely determined by @xmath20 , and particle statistics remain unaffected @xcite .",
    "in fact the equation of motion obtained by varying @xmath14 , @xmath21 , implies that the gauge field @xmath19 is a pure gauge and it can be reabsorbed in a phase redefinition of @xmath6 . in order to obtain a non - trivial theory even in absence of @xmath20",
    "it is quite natural to introduce a kinetic term for @xmath14 , which , for example , could be taken to be in the klein - gordon form . in the following ,",
    "however , we prefer a simpler expression that describes `` chiral '' bose fields , propagating only in one direction .",
    "the reason why we commit ourselves to this specific choice is twofold : we hope both to induce a statistical transmutation and that the chiral dynamics is inherited by @xmath6 .",
    "having a field theoretical model that was both chiral and with anomalous statistics would be of great relevance in the description of the edge states @xcite . as we shall see ,",
    "while this model achieves the first goal ( chirality ) , it fails the other one . on the other hand",
    "its structure is so rich that a detailed study of its properties has intrinsic interest .",
    "the lagrangian density for the chiral boson is proportional to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "( dot / prime indicate differentiation with respect to time / space . ) here @xmath23 is a velocity and the ensuing equations of motion for this kinetic term ( without further interaction ) are solved by @xmath24 ( with suitable boundary conditions at spatial infinity ) , describing propagation with velocity @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath26 is not invariant against a galileo transformation , which is a symmetry of @xmath27 and of @xmath28 : performing a galileo boost on @xmath26 with velocity @xmath29 gives rise to @xmath30 , effectively boosting the @xmath23  parameter by @xmath29 .",
    "consequently one can drop the @xmath31 contribution to the kinetic @xmath14 lagrangian , thereby selecting to work in a global  rest frame \" . boosting a solution in this rest frame",
    "then produces a solution to the theory with a @xmath32 term . in view of the above",
    ", we choose the @xmath14-kinetic lagrange density to be @xmath33 and the total lagrange density is @xmath34 the ensuing equations of motion are    @xmath35    with @xmath36 .",
    "the integrability condition for the last two equation leads to the usual continuity equation @xmath37 now in terms of field @xmath38 eqs ( [ eq:5a ] ) and ( [ eq:5b ] ) become respectively @xmath39 the latter gives the electromagnetic field as a function of the density @xmath40 while the former encodes all the dynamical content of the system . in the following",
    "we shall be mainly interested in the case in which the potential @xmath41 is absent : this corresponds to a schrdinger equation with a _ current _ ( @xmath42 ) nonlinearity : @xmath43 this is to be contrasted with the familiar nonlinear schrdinger equation , where the nonlinearity involves the _ charge density _ ( @xmath44 ) : @xmath45 note that the gauge interaction has dynamically produced a non - trivial alternative to the usual non - linear schrdinger equation , much studied both from physical and mathematical points of view . however eq .",

    "( [ eq:11 ] ) and ( [ eq:14 ] ) @xmath50 represents the density @xmath51 , while @xmath52 is the corresponding current .",

    "we can therefore write a conserved momentum @xmath58 and energy @xmath59 . the unconventional form of the momentum density signals lack of galilean invariance .",
    "in fact , in contrast to the galilean invariant case , @xmath60 is not proportional to the @xmath61 current @xmath62 . indeed computing the time derivative of the galileo generator @xmath63",
    ", we find @xmath64 namely @xmath65 , depending on the sign of the coupling constant , always increases or decreases in time . on the other hand , for a particular choice of the potential @xmath20 ,",
    "the theory becomes scale invariant .",

    "the generator @xmath70 of the scale symmetry takes the form @xmath71 where the density @xmath72 obeys the continuity equation @xmath73 we can remove the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xcontd ] ) proportional to the derivative of @xmath50 by adding a superpotential to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "in fact if we define an improved @xmath74 @xmath75 we obtain @xmath76 the new energy momentum tensor satisfies @xmath77 which is the non relativistic analog of the relativistic traceless condition for scale symmetry . in a galilean invariant theory",
    "this condition would also ensure conformal invariance ; here , instead , the absence of galilean symmetry requires the absence of conformal symmetry .",
    "notice that the classical symmetries of our system form a three dimensional lie sub - algebra of the conformal group ( non - relativistic weyl group in @xmath78dimensions ) with poisson brackets @xmath79    in the following we shall be interested in classical `` localized '' solutions of the scale invariant hamiltonian @xmath80 , \\ ] ] namely normalizable field configurations ( @xmath81 ) with finite energy and momentum . here",
    "@xmath82 is a dimensionless parameter governing the strength of the cubic potential . in the absence of @xmath20 ( _",

    "@xcite that will be our main concern and whose solutions we shall present in detail .",
    "some results about @xmath84 will be also discussed as well because of their relevance in the quantum theory .    unlike the conventional nonlinear schrdinger equation , the family of scale invariant equations we have described , and in particular the one without cubic potential , does not appear to be completely integrable and thus analytic expressions for multisoliton solutions are not available .",
    "it has been remarked , however , that for @xmath85 the resulting schrdinger equation becomes an integrable nonlinear , derivative schrdinger equation with nonlinearity @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "when it comes to the problem of solving non - linear differential equations , very few general tools are available .",
    "one possibility is to look for solutions that possess particular symmetries or whose specific functional dependence simplifies the structure of the original equation . in our case a simple ansatz , which allows us to integrate eq . ( [ eq:11 ] ) , is to assume that the density is a function only of @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88 drawing from the experience of integrable models , we can expect that this choice will allow us to explore the presence of one - soliton solutions or more generally of traveling waves . substituting the ansatz into the continuity equation , yields @xmath89 and hence @xmath90 here",

    "thus @xmath99.\\ ] ] let us notice that the vacuum solution ( [ vacuum1 ] ) is characterized by a vanishing current @xmath100 . thus requiring that a solution approach the vacuum unambiguously fixes the value of @xmath91 in eq .",
