    "among different photoproduction channels special interest is focused today on the processes with two pseudoscalar mesons in the final state .",
    "experimental study of @xmath10 and @xmath11 photoproduction on nucleons and nuclei have become an important part of the research programs of the european laboratory for structural assessment ( elsa ) and mainz microtron ( mami ) facilities @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the database for @xmath0 photoproduction was greatly extended by the new very precise measurements , covering large region of the lab photon energy from threshold up to 3 gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a considerable amount of new data for polarization observables was reported in refs.@xcite .",
    "new experimental results generate a revival of theoretical interest to @xmath0 photoproduction . besides the most early studies of @xcite a recent , rather detailed investigation of this process on a free proton was performed in @xcite .",
    "most of the efforts are directed towards understanding of the general dynamical properties of those @xmath12 and @xmath13 resonances which are not very well seen in the reactions with a single meson and for which only a weak evidence exists @xcite .",
    "analysis of the existing data within different models has provided further insight into the details of the nucleon excitation spectrum , in particular , in the third and the fourth resonance region .",
    "it is however clear , that systematic study of meson photoproduction requires detailed information on the same process in nuclei . here",
    "coherent reactions are of special use .",
    "different works clearly demonstrate their importance , especially in those cases when the production proceeds dominantly via resonance excitations .",
    "one of the main motivations for studying these reactions is to obtain information on the isotopic structure of the elementary production amplitude .",
    "evident advantage of using light nuclei as targets is the small number of nucleons .",
    "this allows one to minimize the influence of a nuclear environment on the elementary process , on the one hand , and to adopt an accurate microscopic description of the nuclear states , on the other hand .    an important question related to @xmath0 photoproduction on nuclei concerns @xmath4-nuclear interaction in the final state .",
    "although the @xmath4-nuclear scattering problem is by itself rather many - sided , the major part of the related questions are connected to the one central point ",
    "@xmath14 phenomenology in the low - energy regime .",
    "more specifically , the matter concerns determination of the @xmath14 low - energy interaction parameters , primarily the scattering length @xmath15 . in the absence of the direct scattering results , final state interaction ( fsi ) in @xmath4 production on nuclei remains the major source of information on the @xmath14 dynamics .",
    "typical method of studying @xmath14 system in these reactions follows the scheme : ( i ) @xmath4 production on nuclei , ( ii ) @xmath16 model , ( iii ) @xmath14 interaction parameters .",
    "the central point in this sequence is the @xmath4-nuclear interaction model . since in general one",
    "intends to connect @xmath16 properties with those of @xmath14 , the @xmath16 model should be based on a refined microscopic approach , wherever possible , and at the same time , it should allow one to take systematically into account fundamental properties of @xmath16 system , such as unitarity of the scattering matrix , which is especially important at low energies . here",
    "the few - body calculations @xcite , utilizing , as a rule , separable @xmath14 matrix , have already deserved a reputation of an effective theoretical method . since these calculations are mostly restricted to the systems with three and four particles , by now only @xmath4 production on deuterium @xcite and @xmath1he @xcite is considered in detail . according to the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , for reasonable values of @xmath14 scattering length with @xmath17 fm and @xmath18 fm , attraction strength is insufficient to generate bound states of @xmath4 with two- and three - body nuclei , so that only virtual poles in these systems appear . on the other hand , for higher values of @xmath19 about 0.8 fm ,",
    "the @xmath4-nuclear forces become nearly strong enough to bind the system . as a consequence ,",
    "the corresponding virtual pole lies very close to the physical region , resulting in strong enhancement of the @xmath4 production cross section .",
    "the case of @xmath2he is less clear .",
    "firstly , the existing data @xcite for the total cross section of @xmath20he shows no threshold enhancement due to final state interaction .",
    "furthermore , in the resent experiment of @xcite no signal from the decay of a hypothetical @xmath4-mesic @xmath2he into @xmath21he in the same reaction @xmath20he was detected .",
    "these results are rather surprising irrespective of existence of @xmath22he bound states .",
    "they mean that the @xmath23-matrix pole which in the case of @xmath7he seems to be close to the threshold energy on the riemann surface , moves far away from this point when we turn to @xmath2he .",
    "even if one takes into account a larger number of nucleons in @xmath2he and profound increase of its density , total disappearance of a signal from @xmath22he interaction in the measured spectrum is rather unexpected .",
    "secondly , there are still no correct few - body results for @xmath24he due to difficulty of the corresponding calculation .",
    "less sophisticated theories , like optical model , are unable to take correctly into account important features of the low - energy @xmath4-nuclear interaction , for example , importance of the virtual target excitations between the successive scattering acts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . therefore , even the qualitative results obtained within this approach are unreliable .",
    "the matter is further complicated by the fact that it is the @xmath22he case , where the binding may appear .",
    "the value of the scattering length corresponding to a weakly bound or virtual state is known to be very sensitive to small variation of the potential parameters .",
    "therefore , it may turn out that if we apply few - body formalism to @xmath24he , the result will strongly depend not only on the @xmath14 parameters , but also on the approximations used for @xmath2he states ( e.g. , on details of the @xmath25-forces at short distances , inclusion of the repulsive core into @xmath25 potential , @xmath26 ) .",
    "this will lead to strong model dependence of the calculation , not to mention that the five - body scattering problem is technically very difficult by itself .    since no microscopic @xmath16 calculations are available for the nuclei with @xmath27 , the methods allowing model independent extraction of the @xmath16 scattering parameters directly from the measured observables are of special importance .",
    "several steps are already done in refs.@xcite , where information on the @xmath4-nuclear scattering from the characteristic behavior or the cross section in the region of small @xmath16 relative energies was obtained . as a rule",
    ", the underlying method is based on the approach developed by watson @xcite and migdal @xcite . under certain conditions",
    "this approach makes it possible to study @xmath16 interaction directly from a distribution over the relative @xmath16 energy .",
    "the case in point is a characteristic enhancement of the @xmath4 yield due to strong attraction between @xmath4 meson and the recoiled nucleus . here again , coherent photoproduction of @xmath0 seems to have some advantages over other reactions , like @xmath28 or @xmath29 , for which one has to take into account interaction between all three final particles .",
    "even the simplest case , when the composite nature of the nucleus is ignored ( e.g. , if one neglects its virtual excitations ) , requires three - body calculation .",
    "this problem should be much less important for @xmath0 photoproduction . in this case",
    "one can safely neglect the interaction between @xmath4 and @xmath30 , since in the energy region under discussion @xmath31gev this system does not resonate . as a result , the whole interaction process may be approximated by the sum of @xmath16 and @xmath32 rescatterings .",
    "although the reactions @xmath33 offer important advantages , up to now rather little effort has been devoted to their theoretical study .",
    "perhaps , the major reason of this fact is difficulty of the experimental identification of these reactions due to smallness of the coherent cross section in comparison to the background quasifree process @xmath34 .",
    "this situation should change with new measurements of @xmath0 photoproduction on nuclei @xcite . in anticipation of the new data , we present here theoretical results for @xmath0 photoproduction on @xmath23-shell nuclei , for which we have chosen as specific examples @xmath5 , @xmath1he , and @xmath2he .",
    "we consider the process @xmath35 where the 4-momenta of the participating particles are given in the parentheses .",
    "the calculations are performed in the laboratory frame where the initial nucleus @xmath36 is at rest ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the circular polarization vector of the photon is denoted by @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "one of the features of the reaction ( [ 20 ] ) is rather high momentum transfer associated with a relatively large mass of the @xmath11 system .",
    "this firstly results in rather low cross section ( several hundreds nb ) and , moreover , in sensitivity of its magnitude to details of the nuclear wave function at short internuclear distances . at the same time",
    ", this sensitivity does not necessarily mean that a refined microscopic nuclear model is required for the calculation .",
    "indeed , according to our general notion about the coherent production , its basic mechanism , yielding the main fraction of the amplitude , is impulse approximation accompanied by the final state interaction ( fsi ) effects . within this model , the unpolarized cross section is mainly governed by the nuclear form factor .",
    "the latter is free from the ambiguities of the nuclear structure and may well be described phenomenologically without resorting to complicated microscopic calculations .",
    "furthermore , interaction of pions with nuclei in the resonance region , where its main effect is attenuation of the pion wave function inside the nucleus , may be described in terms of the pion mean free path in the nuclear matter .",
    "as for the @xmath4-nuclear interaction , which is one of the main objects of the present study , in the low energy region it is mainly determined by the long - range part of the @xmath4-nuclear wave function , and therefore , should be insensitive to the structural details of the nuclear model . taking account of this observation",
    ", we use for the nuclear wave functions the phenomenological models , which reproduce the corresponding formfactors up to the values of momentum transfer , which are characteristic for @xmath11 production in the second and the third resonance region . for the deuteron",
    "we take the wave function of the bonn potential ( full model )  @xcite . for @xmath1he target the separable parametrization from @xcite",
    "is employed , and for @xmath2he we adopt fourier transform of the @xmath40-space wave function from @xcite .",
    "the elementary operator has the well known form @xmath41 reflecting the general spin structure of photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons on spin 1/2 fermions .",
    "here we used the isobar model from ref.@xcite ( first solution ) .",
    "apart from the dominant @xmath42 and @xmath43 resonances , the model @xcite also contains the positive parity states @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and relatively small admixture of the born terms .",
    "the amplitude is diagrammatically presented in fig.2 of ref.@xcite .",
    "the parameters were fitted to the experimental angular distributions of pions and @xmath4 mesons in @xmath48 . in fig.[fig1 ] we show the total cross section of this reaction .",
    "the contributions of different terms are separately presented on the right panel . according to the calculation , in the region up to @xmath49gev the major fraction of the cross section",
    "is provided by the resonance @xmath42 .    on the left panel of fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we also plotted the components @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the cross section coming from the spin - flip and spin independent part of the operator ( [ 30 ] ) . neglecting all terms apart from @xmath42 one",
    "can obtain for the ratio of @xmath50 to @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the ratio of @xmath54 to @xmath55 helicity amplitudes of the @xmath42 resonance @xmath56 in the model @xcite this parameter changes from 0.9 to 1.1 in the region @xmath57gev , where @xmath58(1700 ) dominates ( see fig.6 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , at these photon energies the ratio ( [ ratkl ] ) remains almost constant and is equal to @xmath59 , so that the components @xmath50 and @xmath51 are comparable , as may also be seen from fig.[fig1 ] .    within the impulse approximation",
    "the amplitude on a nucleus is proportional to that on a single nucleon sandwiched between the states including the initial and the final nucleus in the ground state with the spin @xmath60 @xmath61 with @xmath36 denoting the number of nucleons in the target .",
    "the quantity @xmath62 in ( [ 40 ] ) has a meaning of the invariant @xmath63 energy when the nucleon is on the mass shell . to take properly into account the fermi motion effect , which should be important in the resonance region",
    ", we use the prescription @xcite , in which the elementary operator is frozen at the average effective nucleon momentum in the laboratory system @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the momentum transferred to the nucleus and @xmath36 is the nuclear mass number .",
    "this choice is compatible with the requirements of energy and momentum conservation together with the on - mass - shell conditions for the nucleon both in the initial and the final state .",
    "the unpolarized cross section of the reaction ( [ 20 ] ) is proportional to the square of the amplitude ( [ 40 ] ) averaged over the spin states @xmath66 where the total @xmath16 energy @xmath67 , as well as the @xmath4 momentum @xmath68 and the corresponding solid angle @xmath69 are calculated in the @xmath16 center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame .    of primary importance for",
    "the coherent reaction is a relative contribution of the transitions with isospins @xmath70 and @xmath71 . since @xmath4 is an isoscalar particle , the isospin structure of the operator ( [ 30 ] ) is similar to that of single pion photoproduction . in particular , for @xmath0 we have @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the third component of the nucleon isospin operator @xmath74 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath75 and @xmath76 in ( [ isospin ] ) are related to the final @xmath77 state with the isospin @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the isoscalar amplitude @xmath78 leads only to the states with isospin @xmath55 . according to the analyses of @xcite in the region",
    "@xmath79 gev the process ( [ 30 ] ) is dominated by excitation of @xmath13-like resonances , so that the role of the @xmath78 and @xmath75 components is small in the energy region considered . therefore , the resulting elementary cross section is practically the same for proton and neutron targets . for the reactions on nuclei",
    "this means that the effect of coherence is maximal and the cross section does not depend on the isospin of the target .    to take into account interaction between the emitted pion and the final nucleus we used a simplified model in which this interaction is described in terms of classical propagation of a pion in a nuclear matter . in the resonance region",
    "the major impact of a nucleus is attenuation of the pion beam due to absorption .",
    "apart from the true absorption on nucleon pairs , the inelastically scattered pions , which in fact contribute to the incoherent cross section , are also treated as if they are absorbed .",
    "additional interaction effect , which however should be less important in the region considered , comes from the modification of the pion wave number in a nuclear medium , which in particular results in changing diffraction patterns which are characteristic for coherent pion photoproduction in the resonance region . here",
    "we neglect the last effect and take into account only absorption of the produced pions using the simple prescription .",
    "namely , the cross section is multiplied by the energy dependent damping factor , which was calculated as follows .",
    "the pion wave function inside the nucleus was taken in the form used by fernbach , serber , and taylor @xcite for neutron interactions in nuclei : @xmath80 where the damping factor @xmath81 depends on the distance @xmath82 , measured along the classical trajectory of a meson between the point where it was produced and the point where it escaped from the nucleus .",
    "the optical properties of the nuclear environment are determined by the mean free path @xmath83 of a pion .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the @xmath84 scattering cross section @xmath85 averaged over protons and neutrons as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the nuclear density . for simplicity",
    "we take the damping factor @xmath81 out of the matrix element at a mean value @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the nuclear volume . for the nuclear density @xmath90 in ( [ opt_param ] ) and ( [ d ] ) a simple hard sphere form",
    "@xmath91 was taken , where for @xmath92 we used the r.m.s .",
    ". then the absorption effect results in suppressing the cross section by the factor ( see also @xcite ) @xmath94\\right\\}^2\\,,\\quad x=\\frac{r}{\\lambda}\\,.\\ ] ] in fig.[fig2 ] we show our results for coherent single @xmath30 photoproduction on all three nuclei in the first resonance region . as one can see , for the reaction on @xmath5 and @xmath2he the method provides the required suppression in the region of maximum at @xmath95mev . above @xmath96mev",
    "the calculated cross section underestimates the experimental results .",
    "however , in view of extreme simplicity of our model the agreement with the data is quite reasonable .",
    "contrary to the pion case , interaction in the @xmath4-nucleus system , where the major role is played by the strong @xmath23-wave attraction , is mostly important at lower relative energies .",
    "this well known property is also observed in the @xmath97 reaction @xcite where it leads to a pronounced peak in the distribution over the relative @xmath4-nuclear energy @xmath98 in the region of small @xmath98 values .",
    "to extract the @xmath16 interaction parameters , one assumes that this fsi effect is independent on the @xmath4 production mechanism , and , therefore , can be unambiguously isolated .",
    "in fact , this assumption is justified only if the following conditions are fulfilled @xcite : ( i ) the driving reaction mechanism ( @xmath0 photoproduction in our case ) is of short - range nature , i.e. its effective radius is essentially smaller than the characteristic range of @xmath16 forces , and ( ii ) attraction between the particles is comparatively strong and is characterized by low relative momentum , so that it acts during a sufficiently long time . for the reactions with more than two strongly interacting particles in the final state",
    "the third obvious condition should be added : ( iii ) other particles having high velocities , quickly escape the region in which the production mechanism works , and thus have little effect on the interacting pair . from the three conditions above the first two seem to be fairly well satisfied in our case .",
    "indeed , the smallness of the effective range of an interaction responsible for @xmath11 production is ensured by rather large momentum transfer .",
    "strong @xmath16 attraction is due to the nearby pole in the corresponding @xmath23-wave amplitudes .",
    "the third condition is fulfilled due to the small pion mass , which results in rather high velocity of the produced pion , so that in the major fraction of the reaction events it is at a distance well removed from the @xmath16 pair .",
    "this latter aspect is considered in the next section in more detail .    to take into account the @xmath4-nuclear fsi , we add to the impulse approximation @xmath99 the interaction term @xmath100 @xmath101 with @xmath102 here , @xmath103 with @xmath104 is the half - off - shell @xmath16 @xmath105-matrix . in the on - shell region",

    "we would like to start our discussion from the total cross section presented in fig.[fig3 ] . as noted above",
    ", the cross section value is independent of the nuclear isospin and should be mostly determined by the spin of the target and its density .",
    "in particular , the cross section turns out to be rather sensitive to the details of the target wave function .",
    "for example , if one neglects the deuteron @xmath5-wave component , the total cross section for @xmath133 is reduced by about 30@xmath134 at @xmath135gev . furthermore , since , as discussed above , the contributions of the spin - flip and spin independent part in @xmath0 photoproduction are comparable , the nuclear cross section strongly depends on the nuclear spin .",
    "the interplay between the nuclear fromfactor at high momentum transfer and the spin structure of the production matrix element leads to nontrivial dependence of the cross section on the choice of the target . as we can see from fig.[fig3 ] , without fsi the deuteron cross section turns out to be almost twice as large as that on @xmath1he .",
    "since for @xmath136-nucleus interaction we take into account only absorption , the only influence of @xmath137 fsi is attenuation of the cross section .",
    "clearly , it should increase with increasing number of nucleons and increasing the nuclear density .",
    "this means that among the three nuclei considered here the largest effect should be observed for @xmath2he .",
    "furthermore , absorption is known to be especially important in the region of @xmath138 , where @xmath137 scattering becomes highly inelastic , leading for heavier nuclei to the so - called surface production mechanism . in our case",
    "it is responsible for a significant reduction of the total cross section especially above @xmath135gev .",
    "as already noted above , an important feature of the reaction ( [ 20 ] ) is that the time which the produced pion spends in the interaction region is short in comparison to that for the @xmath4 meson . to demonstrate this feature we present in fig.[fig4 ] the distribution of the cross section for @xmath1he@xmath139he over the relative velocity in the @xmath7he and @xmath140he subsystems .",
    "the velocity was calculated in the corresponding @xmath16 and @xmath137 center - of - mass ( c.m . )",

    "the corresponding average values of @xmath148 are @xmath149c and @xmath150c .",

    "taking @xmath150c , @xmath154mev ( corresponds to @xmath146 ) , @xmath155fm , and @xmath156mev@xmath157 one obtains for the pion @xmath158s .    to calculate @xmath159",

    "taking @xmath165fm from table [ ta1 ] and @xmath166 mev ( corresponds to the average relative velocity @xmath167c ) , one obtains for the time delay @xmath168s , so that the resulting value of @xmath169 ( [ tx ] ) turns out to be @xmath170s , almost six times larger than @xmath171 .",
    "this result supports our intuitive assumption that the pion tends to quickly escape the interaction region and its presence should have little effect on the @xmath16 interaction .    to demonstrate the role of @xmath4-nuclear interaction , we show in figs .",

    "such a strong suppression of the @xmath14 inelasticity in a nucleus is also in contradiction to the intuitive expectation that with increasing number of nucleons the inelastic effects in @xmath16 interaction should become more and more important , so that for heavier nuclei the enhancement effect due to @xmath16 attraction is completely overshadowed by the absorption and is practically invisible @xcite .    also desirable",

    "as already noted in introduction , an enhancement effect due to @xmath4-nuclear attraction which is rather well seen in the reactions @xmath189he@xmath190he and @xmath191he was not observed in the case of @xmath2he @xcite .",

    "these reactions have some clear advantages making them preferable to corresponding processes with hadrons as probes .",
    "because of relative weakness of the electromagnetic interaction , photo - induced reactions are known to furnish a special opportunity to study effects of interaction in the final state .",
    "furthermore , the underlying elementary process @xmath192 seems to be under control , in the sense that the results of different analyses @xcite of the existing data agree with each other .",
    "this is in contrast to the reactions @xmath193 or @xmath184he where the driving mechanism is still not completely understood @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to smallness of the pion mass it tends to escape the interaction region with high velocity , and the major fraction of the production events correspond to low relative velocity between @xmath4 and the recoiled nucleus .",
    "this allows a cleaner way to study @xmath4-nuclear interaction , in comparison to @xmath193 where @xmath194 interaction in the final state should always strongly affect the interaction between @xmath4 and the deuteron .",

    "one of the innovations of the present paper is a study of dependence of the total cross section on the spin and isotopic spin of the target .",
    "since @xmath0 photoproduction seems to be dominated by the @xmath58 wave , among the @xmath23-shell nuclei the largest cross section is predicted for @xmath2he whereas for @xmath1he it appears to be twice as small as for the deuteron .",
