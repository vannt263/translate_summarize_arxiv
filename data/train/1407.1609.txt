    "although our galaxy is known to be a barred spiral galaxy , it is very difficult to determine its structure owing to our location within its disk .",
    "considerable uncertainties still exist regarding the number and locations of spiral arms , the length and orientation of the central bar and the rotation curve .",
    "kinematic distances have often been used to infer spiral structure , however , they have large uncertainties stemming from inaccuracies in the adopted galactic rotation model and the existence of significant peculiar ( non - circular ) motions @xcite .",

    "the perseus arm has been proposed as one of the two dominate spiral arms of the galaxy , emanating from the far side of the galactic bar @xcite . toward the galactic anticenter , the perseus arm is relatively close to the sun and parallaxes and proper motions of 14 sources in the perseus arm have already been obtained with the vlba , the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) array , and the european vlbi network ( evn ) @xcite .",
    "here we present trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of 12 massive star forming regions in the perseus spiral arm in the outer galaxy .",

    "the average peculiar motion in the direction of galactic rotation is affected by the @xmath42 component of solar motion .",
    "these peculiar motion values indicate that on average sources in the perseus arm are moving toward the galactic center and move slower than for circular galactic orbits .",
    "compared with the average peculiar motions of the 100 sources with parallaxes in many arms , ( @xmath51 km s@xmath6 and @xmath52 km s@xmath6 from b1 model , @xcite ) , the perseus arm sources have higher average peculiar motions and it seems to be a characteristic of the arm at least in the second and third quadrants .",
    "the general claim of the spiral density wave theory in literature from 1960s is that peculiar motions should be toward the galactic center and counter to the galactic rotation .",
    "our result is consistent with that claim . as for kinematic distances , indeed , the peculiar motions affect them . as shown in table [ tab - kd ] , the standard kinematic distance , which do not consider the average peculiar motions of sources (  @xmath53 = @xmath54 = @xmath55 = 0 km s@xmath6 ) , are biased higher than the true ( parallax ) values in the second quadrant .",
    "the `` revised kinematic distances '' @xcite using the average peculiar motion of the perseus arm ( @xmath53 = 9.2 km s@xmath6 , @xmath54 = 8.0 km s@xmath6 , and @xmath55 = 2.3 km s@xmath6 ) have better agreement with the distance from the parallax than the standard kinematic distance in the second quadrant . in the third quadrants ,",
    "revised kinematic distances may be somewhat biased toward larger distances compared to parallax values .",
    "this portion of the perseus arm may have a smaller @xmath53 peculiar motion than the average for all sources .",
    "therefore , when calculating ( revised ) kinematic distances , for perseus arm sources in the third quadrant , one should probably use @xmath53 @xmath56 2 km s@xmath6 . clearly , more parallax / proper motion measurements are needed to better understand average peculiar motions along the perseus arm .",
