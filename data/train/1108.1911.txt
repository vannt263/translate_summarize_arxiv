    "post - asymtoptic giant branch ( post - agb ) stars represent a very short phase in the evolution of low and intermediate initial mass stars ( @xmath4 ) . during the post - agb phase ,",
    "the high mass - loss rate ( @xmath5 ) observed at the end of the asymtoptic giant branch ( agb ) evolution decreases .",
    "simultaneously , the effective temperature of the central star increases , while the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) slowly detaches from the star ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the post - agb phase ends when the central star is hot enough to ionize the material which was ejected from the agb phase , forming a new planetary nebula ( pn ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is generally assumed that the mass - loss process along the evolution in the agb is spherically symmetric @xcite .",
    "however , a high percentage of pne have been observed showing aspherical symmetries that include elliptical , bipolar or multipolar shapes .",
    "it is still not clear at what point in the evolution toward a pne the departure from the spherical symmetry starts and even more importantly , what the physical processes involved to form the complex shapes observed are .",
    "companion interactions , binary sources , magnetic fields , fast and slow wind interaction , disks and a combination of these have been considered as the main factors to shape pne ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ hydroxyl ( oh ) and water ( h@xmath0o ) maser emission have been observed in the cse of the progenitors of the ( pre-)pne .",
    "typically , for spherically symmetric cses , the double peak spectra of the oh masers defines the most blue- and red - shifted velocities in the cse with respect to the stellar velocity . the velocity range of the h@xmath0o maser spectra is narrower than the oh velocity distribution , and",
    "the h@xmath0o masers are confined closer to the central star . a class of post - agb stars , the so called `` water fountains '' , is characterized by the detection of h@xmath0o maser emission over an unusually large velocity range broader than the velocity range defined by the oh maser emission @xcite .",
    "sources with h@xmath0o maser velocity spread over a range of @xmath6 have been detected ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "those h@xmath0o masers have been observed in regions where the interaction between the high - velocity outflow and the slow agb wind seems to be active , hence the h@xmath0o masers are probably excited in the post - shock region .",
    "recent infrared imaging of water fountains have revealed bipolar and multipolar morphologies @xcite . @xcite",
    "have detected circular and linear polarization in the h@xmath0o maser features along the jet of w43a , the archetypal water fountain .",
    "they found that the jets of w43a are magnetically collimated .",
    "therefore , the detection of polarized maser emission from water fountains is useful to determine the role of the magnetic fields on the onset of wind asymmetries during the evolution from agb stars to aspherical pne .",
    "+ here we report the detection of linear polarization of 22-ghz h@xmath0o maser emission from two water fountains d46 and b292 ( iras 15445@xmath15449 , iras 18043@xmath12116 ) .",
    "the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) was used to observe the h@xmath0o maser emission from d46 ( iras 15445@xmath15449 ) on 2006 november 28 - 30 using the 6b array configuration , and b292 ( iras 18043@xmath12116 ) on 2007 july 6 - 9 with the 6c array configuration .",
    "the full track of observations of d46 was 8 hr , consisting of observations of the source interspersed with scans on the phase calibrator 1613@xmath1586 .",
    "later , b292 was observed over 16 hr , and likewise , its observations were interleaved with a phase reference source , 1730@xmath1130 .",
    "the primary flux calibrator source , 1934@xmath1638 , was observed during each observation program .",
    "the flux density of 1934@xmath1638 at 22.2-ghz was taken to be 0.81 jy .",
    "both observations were performed in full polarization mode , with rest frequency of 22.23508-ghz , using 4-mhz bandwidth with 1024 spectral channels , covering a velocity width @xmath750 @xmath8 and a velocity resolution of @xmath9 . before starting the full observations ,",
    "some snapshots were carried out , for each source , to determine at what range of velocity the brightest emission occurred .",
    "as we could not cover the entire velocity range , the observing bands were centered on the brightest emission peak .",
    "+ the data reduction was performed using the miriad package @xcite . after flagging bad visibilities , the flux density for each phase calibrator",
    "was determined using the flux density of primary flux calibrator .",
    "we obtained flux densities of 1.83 jy and 2.83 jy for 1613@xmath1586 and 1730@xmath1130 respectively .",
    "both sources were used to perform the polarization calibration as well as to determine amplitude and phase solutions , which were applied to the corresponding target data set . for polarization analysis , image cubes for stokes",
    "i , q , u and v were created .",
    "the resulting noise level in the emission free channels of the i cube of d46 was @xmath737 @xmath10 , whereas that of b292 was @xmath713 @xmath10 .",
    "the stokes i image cubes were analysed using the aips task sad , which was used to fit , channel by channel , all the components with peak flux densities higher than five times the rms with two - dimensional gaussians . only those maser features found in at least five consecutive channels were considered reliable detections .",
    "the right ascension and declination for the maser features were calculated as the mean position for each set of consecutive channels .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows the h@xmath0o maser spectra for both sources .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : one ]",
    "in table [ tab : one ] , we present the results of the analysis of the h@xmath0o masers features of d46 and b292 .",
    "we list the peak intensity , the position as ra and dec , lsr velocity ( @xmath11 ) , fractional linear polarization ( @xmath12 ) and polarization angle ( @xmath13 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : h2omas ] we show a map of the h@xmath0o maser regions for both observed sources .",
    "the size of each feature is scaled according to the peak intensity , the radial velocity is colour - coded and the vectors show the polarization angles .",
    "we have identified twenty h@xmath0o maser features for d46 , with emission detected at velocities from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , red - shifted respect to the systemic velocity @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "fractional linear polarization has been detected for five of the twenty features , particularly for the most blue - shifted features , with levels from @xmath17 per cent to @xmath18 per cent .",
    "no significant circular polarization was detected .",
    "+ ten h@xmath0o maser features have been identified in our observation of b292 , with emission at velocities from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite have derived the systemic velocity of the source from the double - peaked 1665-mhz spectrum , obtaining a stellar velocity of @xmath21 .",
    "thus , because of the limited bandwidth , our observation was restricted to blue - shifted velocities only .",
    "fractional linear polarization was detected only for the two brightest features . as presented in table",
    "[ tab : one ] , not only are the fractional linear polarization levels for both features almost the same , but so is the polarization angle . as was the case for d46 , no significant circular polarization was detected .",
    "according to the msx ( [ 8@xmath112],[15@xmath121 ] ) and iras ( [ 12@xmath125],[25@xmath160 ] ) two - colour diagrams , d46 has been classified as a highly - evolve late post - agb object ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "after 22-ghz h@xmath0o maser emission was detected with a velocity range beyond that of the oh masers , it was classified as a water fountain source @xcite .",
    "+ both main - line and 1612-mhz oh maser emission have been detected toward d46 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the irregular line profile of the three lines detected , @xcite suggested that the source was likely a bipolar object , since irregular oh maser profiles are associated with sources that almost certainly have bipolar outflows and a remnant agb wind .",
    "this hypothesis was confirmed by the mid - infrared images ( 11.85 and 12.81 @xmath22 ) of the source , obtained with visir / vlt and recently published by @xcite . from the images",
    "the bipolar structure of the object is clear , with dust emission around the jet lobes .",
    "indeed , the infrared photometry and the iras lrs data reported in the literature ( @xcite , @xcite ) show that the contribution at short wavelengths , which is due to the photospheric component , is still weak and the double - peaked infrared sed , characteristic of post - agb objects , is mainly dominated by the dust emission .",
    "therefore , the central star is surrounded by an optically thick structure @xcite which could be a dense equatorial torus .",
    "+ non - thermal radio continuum emission has been detected at 3 , 6 and 13 cm ( @xcite , @xcite ) with significant flux variation among the observations ( spectral index @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 @xcite ) .",
    "such detections have been associated with synchrotron emission produced by shocks between the high - velocity wind and the slow agb remnant .",
    "the flux variation has been interpreted as episodic shocks between both wind components .",
    "we have observed h@xmath0o maser features only from the red - shifted velocities with respect to the oh maser features , which are centered at @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the brightest features were detected between @xmath1115.0 and @xmath1140.0 km @xmath26 , considering the overlapped region , the overall h@xmath0o spectrum that we have detected is quite similar to the spectrum detected by @xcite , although as expected with some difference of the flux densities .",
    "figure [ fig : h2omas ] ( _ left _ ) shows that the projected spatial distribution of the h@xmath0o maser features resembles a bow - shock - like structure , similar to that observed by @xcite for the water fountain oh 12.8@xmath10.9 .",
    "figure [ fig : spowoh ] ( _ left _ ) shows both the oh and radio continuum positions with respect to the projected distribution of the 22-ghz h@xmath0o maser features that we have detected .",
    "the solid circle represents the uncertainty on the oh position , the error bars show the accuracy of the radio continuum position , whereas the error on the h@xmath0o maser position of each feature is within the size of the symbols .",
    "the offset of the radio continuum position with respect to that of the h@xmath0o maser agrees very well with the mid - infrared image , and it seems likely that both emitting region are at different points along the jet .",
    "in fact , since the h@xmath0o maser features have been produced at the red - shifted side of the jet , the position of the radio continuum could be related to the position of the central star .",
    "but , because the spectral index of the radio continuum implies non - thermal emission @xcite it is more likely synchrotron radiation produced at a region along the jet .",
    "this suggests the presence of a strong magnetic field along the axis defined by the direction of the high - velocity outflow . in figure",
    "[ fig : superima ] we show the mid - infrared image of d46 recently published by @xcite .",
    "the corrected position of the center of the mid - infrared image is ra 15 48 19.420 , dec @xmath154 58 20.100 , with an error circle of radius 2 arcsec ( lagadec , private comunication ) .",
    "thus , as the relative positions are not known accurately enough , for illustration we have overlaid the h@xmath0o maser features with the red - shifted lobe .",
    "the offset of the continuum emission suggest that it could arise from the blue - shifted lobe , as an effect of a strong magnetic field , as mentioned above .",
    "although the error of the oh position encloses part of the blue - shifted lobe , it is likely produced in the outer shells of the cse where the gas has been accelerated to high velocities through wind - wind collisions .",
    "two of the maser features were detected to have a high percentage of linear polarization ( @xmath27 per cent ) , which likely is a result of maser emission in the saturated regime @xcite . for h@xmath0o masers ,",
    "the percentage of linear polarization depends on the degree of saturation of the emiting region and on the angle ( @xmath28 ) between the direction of the maser propagation and the magnetic field lines .",
    "additionally , there is a critical value @xmath29 , such that if @xmath30 , the polarization vectors are parallel to the magnetic field lines , otherwise they both are perpendicular . according to the @xmath12 levels measured , the polarization vectors in figure [ fig : h2omas ] should be perpedicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the vectors then appear to trace the poloidal field component , ie , along the direction of the high - velocity outflow .",
    "we did not detect circularly polarized emission .",
    "as the masers are relatively weak the resulting 3-@xmath3 magnetic field limit is high , @xmath31 mg .        according to its position on the ( [ 8]@xmath1[12],[15]@xmath1[21 ] ) msx two - colour diagram @xcite ,",
    "b292 is likely to be a young post - agb object ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this source was confirmed as a water fountain by @xcite , who have detected 22-ghz h@xmath0o maser emission over a wide velocity range of @xmath32 . in later observations performed by @xcite h@xmath0o maser emission over the even larger velocity range of @xmath33",
    "has been detected , one of the largest velocity spread in any galactic h@xmath0o maser source . until the recent observation of @xcite , it was the water fountain with the largest range in h@xmath0o maser velocities .",
    "in addition , b292 was the first post - agb object discovered with emission from the 1720-mhz oh satellite line @xcite .",
    "the 1720-mhz oh transition is produced in regions with special conditions of temperature and density and it is often associated with both galactic star - forming regions ( sfrs ) and supernova remnants @xcite . its detection is interpreted as an indicator of the existence of c - shocks in the emitting regions .",
    "the detection of oh maser emission at 1665-mhz and 1612-mhz associated with the position of the 1720-mhz maser region did confirm that all the oh maser transitions are related to the same stellar source @xcite .",
    "in fact , the position offset from the 1665-mhz and 1612-mhz emitting region is less than 0.3  @xcite .",
    "neither @xcite nor @xcite have detected the oh 1667-mhz maser transition , which is unusual for a source having maser emission at 1665-mhz .",
    "as mentioned above , @xcite have detected h@xmath0o maser emission at both blue - shifted and red - shifted velocities relative to the systemic velocity .",
    "the projected spatial distribution and position of such features within the same velocity range ( e.g. figure 2 of @xcite ) is quite consistent with the projected position of those features that we have detected ( figure [ fig : h2omas ] ) .",
    "but , considering that the observations were carried out with a time period of almost a year in between , it is important to point out the strong variability of the maser flux intesity . in our spectra ( figure [ fig : spectra ] _",
    "right _ ) there is no maser emission at @xmath34 , while @xcite detected the brightest peak at that velocity .",
    "besides , they have detected our brightest feature at only a half the intensity .",
    "+ as pointed out by @xcite , the spread in the projected distribution of the maser features with the most extreme velocities could be caused by a very small angle between the jet propagation direction and the line - of - sight .",
    "in addition , @xcite have pointed out that the lack of a second ( red - shifted ) peak of the 1720-mhz oh maser emission might be because the line - of - sight is almost parallel to the jet propagation direction . although high - resolution images have not been obtained , we can thus assume that we are looking at the emerging jet almost pole - on . from @xcite , the projected orientation in the sky of the jets is east - west .",
    "the 22-ghz h@xmath0o maser transition is probably excited by the shock front of the high - velocity outflow , which hits the slow expanding agb envelope . @xcite",
    "have reported detection of 22-ghz h@xmath0o maser emission produced in regions under c - shock conditions in a high mass sfr . in late - type stars ,",
    "c - shocks should be produced at the tip of the emergent outflows , whereas the post - shock region seems to achieve the necessary conditions to produce the 1720-mhz oh maser emission .",
    "figure [ fig : spowoh ] ( _ right _ ) indicates the position of the oh maser reported by @xcite relative to the 22-ghz h@xmath0o maser features identified in our analisys .",
    "the uncertainty of the oh maser position is represented by the solid circle .",
    "the fractional polarization level detected for the brightest features is low ( @xmath35 per cent ) and corresponds to non - saturated h@xmath0o maser emission .",
    "consequently , the polarization vectors could be either perpendicular or parallel to the magnetic field component projected in the sky plane .",
    "considering the projected jet direction is east - west , this implies that the b - field is either almost exactly parallel or perpendicular to the jet .",
    "the field in the h@xmath0o maser region of b292 is thus potentially toroidal , as observed for w43a @xcite or poloidal as seen in d46 .",
    "significant levels of circular polarization were not detected .",
    "the 3-@xmath3 upper limit for the field strength is @xmath36 mg .",
    "o maser and radio continuum position overlaid on the mid - infrared image published by @xcite . for illustration , we have shifted the mid - infrared image , within the 2 arcsec of uncertainty of its position , in order of align the h@xmath0o maser features with the red - shifted side of the high - velocity outflow.,width=302 ]",
    "we have used the atca to observe high - velocity h@xmath0o emission from two late - type stars , d46 and b292 .",
    "we have presented new high angular resolution images of the h@xmath0o maser emission in parts of the jet and measured linear polarization for both sources .",
    "the first h@xmath0o maser maps of d46 show a bow - shock morphology similar to that of oh 12.8@xmath10.9 . according to the level of @xmath12 that we have measured , the maser emission is in the saturated regime , and the polarization vectors should be perpendicular to the magnetic field lines , which consequently are the poloidal component . in figure [",
    "fig : superima ] we have overlaid the position of the masers with the red - shifted lobe of the jet on the mid - infrared vlti image of d46 from @xcite .",
    "the relative position of the radio continuum emission with respect to those maser features suggest that it is arising from the blue - shifted lobe and is likely due to synchrotron radiation , indicating the potential presence of a significant magnetic field in the jet .",
    "circular polarization was not detected , and we can not infer the magnetic field strength along the line - of - sight to better than a 3-@xmath3 limit of @xmath31 mg for d46 .",
    "new polarization observations , including that of the radio continuum emission and a broader velocity range of the h@xmath0o spectrum could give accurate measurements of the magnetic field strength along the jets of d46 .",
    "for the h@xmath0o of b292 we have measured low @xmath12 levels , and the polarization vectors could be either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field lines projected on the sky plane .",
    "in fact , the projection of the jets in the sky is likely east - west , and the polarization vectors could be associated to either the poloidal ( i.e. east - west ) or toroidal ( i.e. north - south ) component of the b - field .",
    "also in this case , no significant levels of circular polarization were not detected .",
    "the 3-@xmath3 upper limit for the magnetic field strength , is @xmath36 mg .",
