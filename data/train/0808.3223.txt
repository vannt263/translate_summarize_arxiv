    "recent studies of the isospin dependence of nuclear reactions at intermediate energies have been studied by comparing fragmenting collisions of similar mass and energies but different isospin .",
    "experimentally , the ratio of isotope yields in two different systems , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , has been seen to follow , approximately , an exponential function of the neutron number , @xmath6 , and the proton number , @xmath7 , of the isotopes ; dependence known as _ isoscaling _",
    "@xcite : @xmath8where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fitting parameters and @xmath11 is a normalization constant .",
    "this fit has been studied under the light of several theoretical models of nuclear reactions and , under different assumptions ( see _ eg . _",
    "@xcite ) , the fitting parameters can be expected to be related to the symmetry term of the equation of state , @xmath12 , through @xmath13 \\ ,   \\label{eq2}\\ ] ]  where @xmath14 is the assumed temperature of both reactions thus the interest on studying the isoscaling phenomenon : @xmath0 has the potential of elucidating the behavior of @xmath12 at varying isospin , temperature , etc .. it is relevant to notice that according to the above displayed relation the coefficient @xmath9 should approach @xmath15 as @xmath14 increases .    in a series of recent works",
    ", however , it has been shown that the phenomenon of isoscaling can be found very early before thermalization in classical molecular dynamics simulations of nuclear reactions  @xcite , as well as in non - thermal physical phenomena , such as in percolating networks .",
    "in particular , percolation in two _ colors _ , ( _ i.e. _ protons and neutrons  @xcite ) , or in extended polychromatic  nets  dorso-1 , has demonstrated that the isoscaling behavior of the form of equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) emerges as a direct consequence of simple combinatorial problems with , _ eg .",
    "_ @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "these results point to the fact that isoscaling , although connected to the equation of state , can also be produced by non - thermal processes.and then , probabilistic aspects of the problem can play a disturbing role complicating the determination of @xmath12 from isoscaling deermination .",
    "thus the motive of the present work : to study the probabilistic aspects of isoscaling .    in this study",
    "we investigate the phenomenon of isoscaling in the very simplest scenario free of the geometrical constraints imposed by bond percolation of sampling protons  and neutrons  directly from an urn . in section  [ sec1 ]",
    "we will obtain the correct isoscaling law using probabilistic arguments , and will show that equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) is a limiting approximation to the exact expression . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we compare our results to experimental values , after which the manuscript closes listing several conclusions .",
    "consider the problem of building clusters containing a number @xmath18 of nucleons by simply grabbing these @xmath18 particles from an urn in which there are @xmath19 particles composed of @xmath20 `` protons '' and @xmath21 `` neutrons '' , @xmath22 .",
    "we assume the sampling to be without replacement , and with no interactions amongst the particles nor with the urn itself ; these premises are known as simple random sampling ( @xmath23 ) in the statistics circles .    to use this setup to study isoscaling",
    "we first focus on determining the yield of fragments , @xmath24 , that the previous scheme would produce after a large number of samplings .",
    "stands to reason that such yield would be directly related to the probability of drawing @xmath6 neutrons and @xmath7 protons , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath25 . repeating then for a second urn with a different isotopic composition",
    ", one can easily obtain the corresponding @xmath0 and , thus , the scaling law .",
    "let us first determine the probability of ending with a cluster composed by @xmath26 neutrons and @xmath7 protons , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath25 .",
    "the number of ways in which a cluster of @xmath18 particles can be obtained from randomly sampling an urn with @xmath19 particles is @xmath27 . out of these possibilities",
    "only @xmath28 will correspond to clusters with @xmath6 neutrons and @xmath7 protons .",
    "thus , if we now assume that the probability of getting a fragment of size @xmath18 out of an urn with @xmath19 particles is @xmath29 , the normalized yield of such a sampling will be : @xmath30 in particular for the case of sampling @xmath18 particles composed of @xmath6 neutrons and @xmath7 protons ( @xmath25 ) from an urn with @xmath31 the term @xmath32 becomes @xmath33and taking the ratio of this probability to the probability of obtaining @xmath6 neutrons and @xmath7 protons from a sampling of @xmath18 nucleons from an urn with @xmath34 nucleons composed of @xmath35 neutrons and @xmath36 protons , the isoscaling ratio is given exactly by @xmath37which can be readily used for calculations taking @xmath38 as an overall normalization .    this expression",
    ", although close to the usual exponential law  ( [ eq1 ] ) , is not a straight line in the linear - log plot of @xmath0 versus @xmath21 ; the fact that experimental data also deviates from such a linear behavior is reassuring ( see @xmath39  @xcite ) .",
    "the approximate exponential law  ( eq1 ) can be obtained from the exact result  ( [ eq4 ] ) using the binomial approximation to the hypergeometric distribution ( see _ eg .",
    "_  ross ) which , in this case , depends on the assumption that @xmath40 for @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the sampling isoscaling ratio then becomes @xmath44where we have introduced the probabilities of extracting a neutron , @xmath17 , and a proton , @xmath45 .",
    "comparing to equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) we identify the overall normalization constant as @xmath46 and the isoscaling parameters as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , in perfect agreement with the percolation results  davila , dorso-1 . reviewing the procedure leading to equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) , it is clear that exponential law is a direct result of the sampling .",
    "[ for completeness , although not relevant to the nuclear case , we note that a functionally similar result can be obtained for the case of sampling with replacement . in this case",
    ", fragments with @xmath25 will appear with probability @xmath49 , where @xmath11 is given by the normalization @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 were defined before .",
    "using this for urns @xmath3 and @xmath4 leads to @xmath53 % \\left [ \\frac{\\left ( p_2-q_2\\right ) \\left ( -q_1^{a+1}+p_1^{a+1}\\right ) } { % \\left ( p_1-q_1\\right ) \\left ( -q_2^{a+1}+p_2^{a+1}\\right ) } \\right]=c(a)\\frac{% p(a , a_2)}{p(a , a_1 ) } \\left [ \\frac{q_2}{q_1}\\right]^n\\left [ \\frac { p_2}{p_1}% \\right ] ^z   \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] where @xmath54/\\left [ \\left ( 2p_1 - 1\\right ) \\left ( -q_2^{a+1}+p_2^{a+1}\\right ) % \\right]$ ] . since @xmath55 is independent of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , equation  ( [ eq6 ] ) depends on these variables in a functionally similar manner as the isoscaling law  ( [ eq1 ] ) . ]",
    "the energy dependence of the isoscaling parameters has already been explored in collisions  @xcite ; here we compare the isoscaling parameter @xmath9 obtained from experiments to those from samplings , and study their variation as a function of beam energy .    in view of the previous result , namely the fact that isoscaling can be expected from the mere act of fragmenting a system , the question to answer now is : what fraction of the nuclear isoscaling is due to sampling ?    in what follows we will show to which extent combinatorial effects ( aka symentropy effects , see @xcite ) , are relevant by comparing the value of @xmath9 obtained from experimental calculations with the one resulting from the simple combinaorial analysis .",
    "it is worth realizing at this point that in the case of the combinatorial analysis we are disregarding all correlations , in particular those associated with energy terms and then correspond to the very high temperature limit.(see for example @xcite).we then expect that the contribution of combinatorial terms to be apparent in collisions at high energies . here",
    "we present a direct comparison of our findings to two sets of experimental data not to try to reproduce them but to assess the relative magnitude of the sampling contribution to isoscaling , and to attempt to draw a baseline from which future experimental studies will be able to extract the nuclear contribution to this effect .",
    "the data used was obtained by yennello _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite at the cyclotron institute of the texas a&m university    the values of @xmath56 used in this comparison are shown in the inset of figure  [ fig1 ] and correspond to the ratios of the yields @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 at the energies shown .",
    "the main panel of figure  [ fig1 ] shows the ratio of @xmath56 to the corresponding parameter obtained from the sampling , @xmath61 ; _ cf .",
    "_ equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) .     to the sampling",
    "@xmath62 as a function of energy . ]    it is easy to see that at all energies @xmath63 , and that for large energies @xmath64 .",
    "a second point of interest is the fact that upon division by @xmath65 , the previously scattered four curves of @xmath56 values collapse into a single group ..",
    "the conclusions of this work are quite simple .",
    "first we note that isoscaling can be expected to appear in any system undergoing a _ fair _ sampling ; nuclear fragmentation being a type of sampling is bound to exhibit this phenomenon .",
    "second , the inherent correlations of nuclear systems are expected to have an effect on the _ fairness _ of the sampling modifying the yield ratio @xmath66 and the isoscaling parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as was demonstrated by a direct comparison to experimental results .",
    "finally , a word of caution is needed if one attempts to extract information about the nuclear equation of state from isoscaling .",
    "given that it is now known that a sampling - related isoscaling is ever present , obtaining quantities such as @xmath12 from equation  [ eq2 ] is not straightforward . in principle , the experimental results should contain the isoscaling produced by sampling , and in some regime both @xmath67 and @xmath68 should tend to @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the indication that @xmath71 at high energies indicates perhaps that at those energies nuclear binding is less important and the `` _ _ sampling _ _ '' is closer to that of a non - interacting urn ; at lower energies , however , the reaction has longer interaction times and the phase space available for the _ sampling _ becomes a complex function of the energy distancing itself from the fair sampling case of equations  ( [ eq4 ] ) and  ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the implications of equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) which , through its inverse dependence on the temperature , indicates that in the limit of high energies the expected contribution from the equation of state to the isoscaling coefficients should vanish : @xmath72 .",
    "likewise , studies of bond percolation on polychromatic substrates  @xcite ( generated through the nuclear lattice model at temperature @xmath14 ) have shown that in the limit of high temperatures only the probabilistic term survives ."
