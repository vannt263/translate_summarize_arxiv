    "a rather natural explanation for the existence of the fermionic generations is that the known leptons and quarks are composite @xcite , sharing some common constituents ( preons ) . in this sense , it is conceivable that the sm is just the low energy limit of a more fundamental theory , which is characterized by a large mass scale @xmath6 . in general , composite models exhibit a rich spectrum which includes many new states like the excitations of the known particles .    since the existence of excited fermions is an undeniable signal for new physics beyond the sm ,",

    "moreover , a limit on the mass of an excited electron of @xmath10 gev at @xmath11 of confidence level was set from the measurement of the @xmath12 cross section @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the experiments at the desy @xmath13 collider hera searched , in a model independent way , for resonances in the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 systems @xcite , however the lep bounds on excited leptons couplings are about one order of magnitude more stringent in the mass region just below the @xmath17 mass .    up to now all the direct searches for compositeness have failed , and we expect that the next generation of accelerators , working at higher center  of  mass energies , will be able to further extend the search for composite states . on the theoretical side , there have been extensive studies on the possibility of unraveling the existence of excited fermions in @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath0 @xcite , and @xmath13 @xcite collisions at higher energies .    a particularly interesting machine for analyzing the substructure of the electron and its neutrino is the next linear @xmath0 collider ( nlc ) that is been planned to operate with a center  of  mass energy of at least @xmath19 gev and an integrated luminosity around 10 fb@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "at the nlc , it will be possible to convert an electron beam into a photon one focusing a laser on the electron beam . by compton scattering ,",
    "high energy photons are produced along the electron direction carrying away a large amount of the beam energy @xcite .",

    "in particular , it is important to determine the spin of the fermionic excitations since the allowed values of the spin can give hints about the underlying preonic structure @xcite .",
    "we perform a detailed study of the experimental signatures of excited fermions exploring the possibility of polarizing both the electron and laser beams , and we point out the best strategy to unravel the spin and the chiral couplings of the excited leptons to the usual particles .",

    "this paper is supplemented with an appendix that contains the complete helicity amplitudes for the processes under study , as well as for the decays of the excited leptons .",
    "composite models can not be analyzed perturbatively since the preons interact strongly at the energy scales of interest .",
    "instead , we must rely on effective lagrangians to describe the couplings of excited states with ordinary fermions and vector bosons .",
    "we demanded that the effective lagrangians for the excited fermions are @xmath27 conserving and that they respect the @xmath28 gauge invariance .",

    "the above couplings of the excited leptons allow them to decay predominantly into the ground state lepton through the emission of a photon with widths @xmath41 in this work , we assumed that the branching ratio of these particles into electron  photon pairs is equal to one .",
    "the helicity amplitudes for these decays are presented in the appendix .",
