    "one of the most important legacies of  is the discovery and the study of kpc - scale x - ray jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "mostly ,  detected x - ray emission from the jets of fris and friis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , raising important questions of the mechanisms of emission of the high - energy radiation and the acceleration processes in these sources .",
    "the study of extended structure in bl lac objects , however , lags behind .",
    "x - ray emission from extended structures were so far detected in only 3 of such sources : pks  0521365 ( birkinshaw , worrall , & hardcastle 2001 ) , 3c  371 @xcite , and pks  2201 + 044 @xcite .",
    "these objects are peculiar , in the sense that broad optical emission lines were occasionally detected from their nuclei , leading to an intermediate classification between bl lacs and qsos . indeed , their x - ray jets present properties both of fris and friis .    here",
    "we report the discovery of an x - ray counterpart to the 18radio jet in the bl lac s5  2007 + 777 ( z=0.342 ) .",
    "the source is a well - known bl lac from the 1 jy sample @xcite with a narrow radio jet ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the results is in preparation @xcite .",
    "we observed s5  2007 + 777 with  on may 23 , 2005 .",
    "the acis - s data were reducted according to standard procedures yielding 33  ks of good data .",
    "archival  ( acs f814w and wfpc2 f702w ) and  1.5 and 4.8  ghz observations were also used .",
    "figure  1 shows a montage of the multiwavelength images of the jet . at radio",
    ", the jet appears knotty with several well - defined knots of emission .",
    "x - ray emission is present from all the radio knots .",
    "figure  1 , bottom , shows that there is a remarkable correspondence between the radio and the x - ray emission .",
    "table  1 lists the properties of the jet , including the radio spectral index and the radio - to - x - ray broad - band index .",
    "the x - ray flux and flux densities were calculated with ` pimms ` using the knot s count rate in column 2 and assuming a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath0 and galactic n@xmath1=8.58@xmath2  ( table  2 ) .",
    "there are no variations of the x - ray - to - radio flux ratio along the jet .",
    "we extracted the x - ray spectrum of the full jet and of the brightest knot at 8.5  from the core ( table  2 ) .",
    "as for the latter a total of 43 counts were collected , the spectral fit was performed using the c - statistics .",
    "the full jet x - ray spectrum is well described by a power law with @xmath3 . a thermal model is equally acceptable , but the fitted temperature , kt=64 kev ,",
    "effectively mimicks a power law .",
    "similarly , knot k8.5 is fitted with a power law with rather hard slope ( table  2 ) , albeit within large uncertainties .",
    "table  2 also reports the spectral parameters from a fit to the core x - ray spectrum .",
    "the latter is described by a power law with @xmath4 , softer than the jet .",
    "thus , as in the cases of 3c  371 and pks  2201 + 044 , there is evidence for hardening of the x - ray emission going from the core to the jet .",
    "no diffuse x - ray emission is detected around the core .",
    "this paper presents new  and archival  and observations of the kpc - scale jet in the bl lac s5  2007 + 777 .",
    "an x - ray counterpart to the radio jet was detected , with a remarkable morphological correspondence at the two wavelengths .",
    "this morphological similarity provides first clues to the origin of the high - energy emission .",
    "a likely possibility is that the x - rays are produced via inverse compton scattering of seed photons ( cmb ? ) off the same electrons responsible for the synchrotron radio emission .",
    "indeed , a similar 1:1 correspondence between the radio and x - ray jet is also present in powerful friis and similar or higher z , where ic / cmb is thought to play a dominant role @xcite .",
    "note that if the x - rays were the high - energy tail of the longer - wavelength synchrotron emission the size of the x - ray knots would be smaller than at radio , due to the shorter lifetimes of the higher - energy electrons , unless acceleration occurs throughout the entire volume .    to better quantify the properties of the x - ray jet",
    ", we assembled its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from radio to x - rays .",
    "knot k8.5 was used , as it is the brightest . a 3@xmath5 upper limit to the optical emission was derived from the acs data .",
    "the sed is shown in figure  2 .",
    "we also report the result of the modeling of the sed with the synchrotron+ic / cmb model @xcite .",
    "the hard x - ray emission can be reproduced assuming that it belongs to the low energy tail of the ic / cmb component : this choice implies a relatively large value for the minimum energy of the relativistic electrons , @xmath6 , compared to the `` typical '' value @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor is @xmath8 .",
    "one of the motivations for observing this source with  was to test the structure of the jet .",
    "it has been proposed , and supported by radio observations , that agn jets may have two components - a fast spine and a slow wall .",
    "the latter contributes synchrotron x - ray emission when the jet is seen at larger viewing angles ( as in fris ) , while the fast - moving plasma in the spine is responsible for the beamed ic / cmb emission seen in frii jets .",
    "bl lacs are more aligned versions of fris .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of their jet x - ray emission should originate via ic / cmb off the fast spine .",
    "s5  2007 + 777 was chosen for this study because of it exhibits a long , collimated jet , while in most bl lacs the radio jets appear larger and more diffuse ( murphy , browne , & perley 1993 ) , perhaps because of smaller viewing angles .",
    "our results confirm the original expectations that , at a favorable angle , the x - ray emission from the jet of a bl lac is dominated by ic / cmb as in powerful friis .",
    "this also provides circumstantial evidence in support of a spine - wall structure for the jet .",
