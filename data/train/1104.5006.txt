    "while it is generally agreed that the enormous energy output of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as well as x - ray binaries ( xrb ) is due to accretion of matter onto a compact object ( @xmath4{\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1 $ ] , see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) , the fate of the accreted material is somewhat uncertain .",
    "most likely , a large fraction of this accreted matter crosses the event horizon of the black hole and is forever lost from the observer s view .",
    "however , the presence of relativistic outflows , often dubbed `` jets '' , observed to emanate from the very core of the agns and xrbs , show that some of the accreted material is in fact ejected from the inner accretion flow .",
    "recent simulations show that such jets are likely poynting flux dominated , i.e. , only a very small fraction of the accreted material is ejected while most of the energy in the jets is carried by the electromagnetic fields .",
    "launching of such relativistic outflows , their composition , and their association with the accretion inflow are currently topics of intense research .",
    "observations indicate that nuclear radio - loudness of agns ( parametrized by the radio - to - optical luminosity ratio ) tends to increase with decreasing eddington - scaled nuclear luminosity @xcite .",
    "a similar situation is seen in xrbs accreting at low mass accretion rates where the radio loudness ( in this case parametrized by radio to soft x - ray flux ratio ) tends to increase with decreasing x - ray luminosity @xcite . the radio emission from a radio loud agn",
    "is generally attributed to synchrotron emission from a population of nonthermal particles in the jets and the lobes .",
    "but the emission mechanism in radio quiet agns such as seyferts remains much less well understood .",
    "recent vlbi observations reported by @xcite have detected radio emission from the nuclear region of four very faint seyfert galaxies ( ngc 4051 , ngc 4388 , ngc 4501 , and ngc 5033 ) , where high brightness temperature ( t@xmath5@xmath6 k ) and ( in some cases ) resolved structure in the core favor a weak jet / outflow origin for these sources .    among these four faint seyferts studied by @xcite , ngc 4051 ,",
    "one of the `` original '' seyfert galaxies studied by @xcite due to its strong nuclear emission lines , is a narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ; see @xcite for definition of nls1s ) that has been well studied in almost all wavelengths from radio to the x - rays . located in the ursa major cluster of galaxies ,",
    "ngc 4051  is a fairly nearby ( z=@xmath7 ) spiral galaxy .",
    "based on the latest reverberation mapping estimates , the agn in the heart of ngc 4051  boasts a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) of @xmath8 m@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , recent vlbi observations of ngc 4051  at 1.6 and 5 ghz show a complex , sub - parsec - scale compact core and other structure @xcite .",
    "similar results have also been obtained from recent _ vla_/_e__vla _  observations @xcite .",
    "the high brightness temperature of the compact core of ngc 4051  ( @xmath10 k ) along with the observed radio structures lead to the conclusion that the radio emission maybe be nonthermal in origin , and likely originating from an outflow / jet .    from gemini near - infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs ) data of ngc 4051 ,",
    "@xcite have found a strong hii br@xmath11 emission at 2.1661 @xmath12 m in the nuclear spectrum ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) . based on h@xmath132.1218@xmath12m / br@xmath11 line ratio they concluded that some contribution to the strong br@xmath11 emission is from shocks or energy injection due to interaction of the h@xmath14 emitting gas with the jet . while the strong br@xmath11 line may be associated with interaction with the jet",
    ", it is quite unlikely that the ir continuum emission is dominated by the jet .",
    "earlier high time resolution monitoring at 2.2@xmath12 m continuum emission of ngc 4051  by @xcite does not show any rapid ir variability ( relative to x - rays ) which might be expected if the dominant fraction of the observed ir emission is an extension of the optically - thin x - ray emission ( e.g. as recently found for the stellar black hole binary system xte  j1550@xmath15564 by @xcite ) .",
    "simultaneous optical , ir and x - ray observations of ngc 4051  obtained by @xcite also show little optical / ir variability compared to the x - rays , suggesting different origins for the x - ray continuum and optical / ir continuum emission .",
    "compact , steady jets are observed from xrbs when they are in _ hard _ x - ray state , i.e. , their x - ray spectrum is dominated by hard power law emission and large r.m.s .  variability . in contrast , such steady , compact jets are not seen when xrbs are in the _ soft _ x - ray state characterized by predominantly thermal spectrum from the accretion disc and low r.m.s . variability .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , for extensive definitions and review of x - ray states in xrbs , and @xcite for a review of xrb jets .",
    "it is still not clear which physical mechanism(s ) trigger transition between these states , as well as the associated change in disk  jet coupling .",
    "such state transitions and appearance / disappearance of radio jets are now regularly seen in transient x - ray binary systems ( where epochs of activity typically span @xmath0month or less ) , thanks to advances in instrumentation and coordinated , quasi - simultaneous multiwavelength observations over the past decade .",
    "such changes however can not be seen in agn because the associated timescales can easily exceed the human lifespan , and advances can only be made via studying ensemble properties of agn .",
    "indeed , recent works show that there exists a tight relationship connecting the radio luminosity , x - ray luminosity , and black hole mass .",
    "this relationship , often referred to as the `` fundamental plane '' of black hole accretion @xcite , not only holds across the stellar mass black holes in hard state and low - luminosity agns ( llagn ) , but also for supermassive black holes with direct , dynamical mass - measurements ( i.e. the @xmath16 agns ; see @xcite ) , and extends to blazars as well ( plotkin et al . in prep . ) .",
    "@xcite have argued that ngc 4051  and the stellar mass black hole cygnus x@xmath17 in soft state have very similar fourier power density spectra , and therefore ngc 4051  may be a soft state agn accreting at @xmath030% l@xmath18 .",
    "based on the bending frequency of the fourier power spectrum of ngc 4051 , these authors had deduced a central black hole mass of @xmath19m@xmath9 , which was consistent with the best estimated reverberation mass of @xmath20m@xmath9  at that time .",
    "however , the most recent , revised reverberation mass estimate of @xmath21m@xmath9  by @xcite is @xmath05.7 times larger , consequently lowering the bolometric luminosity to @xmath05% l@xmath18 .",
    "moreover , as discussed in detail in their discussion section , the assumed x - ray to bolometric conversion factor of 27 is quite likely an overestimate . on the other hand ,",
    "another commonly used empirical relationship to estimate the bolometric luminosity of similar agns is @xmath22 ( 5100  ) @xcite . given ngc 4051 s host galaxy starlight subtracted average nuclear flux density at 5100   is ( 4.5@xmath230.4)@xmath24 erg s@xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath25 @xcite , its bolometric luminosity is roughly @xmath27 l@xmath18 . both of the above estimates of the bolometric luminosity are closer to galactic black hole binaries in hard state than in soft state .",
    "it is also worth noting that cygnus x-1 is actually never in a `` classical '' soft state , but rather it is always somewhat transitional ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus it is unclear whether ngc 4051  is indeed a soft state agn , or in hard state , or perhaps in a transitory state between canonical hard and soft states .",
    "can xrb state definitions be straightforwardly carried over to agns",
    "? such are the questions which motivate the current work .    since jets are known to emit over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum spanning from radio through x - rays , it is plausible that at least some of the observed nuclear emission from ngc 4051  might also originate in the jet . in this work",
    "we have collected high quality , high - resolution nuclear seds of ngc 4051  from the literature , to study the broadband ( radio  x - ray ) sed and test whether the observed nuclear emission can originate in a mildly relativistic jet outflow .",
    "we use the accretion disk+jet model developed by @xcite , @xcite to model the broadband continuum .",
    "the model has been successfully applied to explaining broadband seds of several black hole x - ray binaries in hard state , as well as that of the llagns sagittarius a * , m81 * ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these previous results suggest that despite a difference of @xmath056 orders of magnitude in mass , the accretion / ejection processes in stellar mass black holes ( @xmath010m@xmath9 ) and supermassive black holes in the nearby low - luminosity agns ( @xmath0@xmath28m@xmath9 ) appear quite similar when comparing sources with similar eddington scaled luminosity .",
    "this is the first time we apply this jet model to a radio - quiet seyfert galaxy to test whether the broadband emission originates in a collimated jet outflow .",
    "the sources from which we obtained the multi - wavelength sed data are described in ",
    "[ s : data ] , and a brief summary of the model parameters that best match the data is given in ",
    "[ s : analysis ] .",
    "implications of the modeling results and conclusions drawn from the study are discussed in ",
    "[ s : conclusion ] .",
    "the nuclear region of ngc 4051  has been observed with many different ground - based as well as space - borne telescopes spanning from radio through x - rays , at the highest spatial resolution available in each of these wavelength ranges .",
    "the high angular resolution is of crucial importance for isolating the central , nuclear emission from that of the surrounding galaxy .",
    "this is especially important in optical and ir wavelengths where contributions from non - agn components such as the host galaxy s stellar population , ongoing star formation near the nuclear region , and dust can easily dominate the observed emission if the photometric aperture is not small .      the x - ray flux from ngc 4051  is known to be highly variable on a timescale of days ( see , e.g. , * ?",

    "like most nls1s , the 210 kev x - ray continuum sed of ngc 4051  is well modeled by a power law .",
    "a narrow iron line is seen near 6.4 kev , and the presence of curvature at higher energies hint towards presence of reflection @xcite .",
    "similar to the x - ray spectra of many other nlss , there exists an excess of soft photons in addition to the power law at @xmath292 kev ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we are interested in the power - law continuum only and take the power - law photon index ( @xmath30 ) and normalization from a recent simultaneous radio ( _ vla_/_evla_)x - ray ( _ chandra _ ) campaign of ngc 4051  published by @xcite .",

    "( _ fuse _ ) observations presented by @xcite .",
    "even though the three _ fuse _  observations were separated by as much as @xmath0 one year , the analysis by @xcite suggests little or no ( @xmath2910% ) variation in the _ fuse _  spectra .",
    "as discussed above , we are interested in the continuum emission only , and therefore use the average flux - density measurements in wavelength ranges that are free from emission and absorption as presented in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "we have also included _",

    "the binned stis spectrum presented in their work shows that the continuum flux is roughly constant at @xmath33 erg  @xmath26  s@xmath25  @xmath25 over the observed wavelength range of 12001700  .",
    "these _ hst _  observations were made simultaneously with _",
    "chandra _ , and even though the _ chandra_light curve showed large variations in the x - ray flux ( see , e.g , fig .",
    "2 of @xcite ) , no variability could be detected in the stis data .",
    "the lack of uv variability strongly contrasts with the high x - ray variability and suggests that the uv and x - rays are most likely coming from different emission mechanisms .",
    "contribution of non - agn components , e.g. light from stars as well as dust , starts becoming important in optical and ir , and extreme caution must be taken not only to use highest resolution available to observe the nuclear region , but also to model and subtract the non - agn contributions within the aperture .",
    "readily available optical and ir fluxes listed , e.g. in the ned , are therefore not usable for this work since the apertures listed in ned are typically large and there is no easy way to estimate the non - agn contribution .",
    "instead we use the results obtained by @xcite , who presented new , optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of ngc 4051from a densely sampled reverberation mapping campaign , using data from five different observatories ( 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope at mdm observatory , 0.7 and 2.6 m telescopes of the crimean astrophysical observatory ( crao ) , 2 m magnum telescope at the haleakala observatories , and the 0.4 m telescope of the university of nebraska(unebr ) ) .",
    "they then subtract the host galaxy starlight contribution to the continuum flux following the prescription by @xcite . the estimated agn continuum flux at 5100",
    "  for ngc 4051  is @xmath34 erg  s@xmath25  @xmath26  @xmath25 after subtracting host galaxy starlight contribution .",
    "the host galaxy starlight contribution is about twice that of the agn .",
    "however the optical flux is much less variable than the x - ray and euv .",
    "the excess variance in the 5100   measurements of @xcite is 0.09 .",
    "a recent analysis of last twelve years of x - ray and optical variability in ngc 4051  by @xcite also concluded that the variability of the agn in optical wavelengths ( where the fractional variability , f@xmath35 , is @xmath01226% ) is much smaller than the the variability in x - rays ( f@xmath36% ) .      for ir we used the",

    "three representative continuum fluxes at 2.1 , 2.2 , and 2.25@xmath12 m from the nuclear ( central 0.1@xmath370.1 ) region obtained by the nifs are shown by the cyan points in fig .",

    "therefore contribution of direct agn emission in mir appears to be small .",
    "the slit width of the ir spectrograph is 3.6 arcsec , which at the distance of ngc 4051  implies a linear scale of @xmath0175 ( d/10 mpc ) parsec .",
    "spitzer_/irs slit width is a factor of 18 larger than that of the _ hst_/stis slit width ( 0.2 arcsec ) and the former therefore includes significantly larger circumnuclear regions .",

    "we note that no cosmological k - correction was made to the observed continuum fluxes .",
    "given the small redshift of ngc 4051  ( z=0.0023 ) , any k - correction is negligible and uncertainties in absolute flux calibrations are much larger than this correction .",

    "the continuum jet emission in the outflow - dominated model we have used here is based on previous works by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to these works for the details of the model .",
    "the main parameters that determine the properties of the jet in this model are the input jet power ( n@xmath39 ) , electron temperature of the relativistic thermal plasma entering at the jet base ( t@xmath40 ) , the ratio of magnetic to particle energy density ( a.k.a .",
    "the equipartition factor @xmath41 ) , physical dimensions of the jet base ( assumed to be cylindrical with radius r@xmath42  and height h@xmath42 ) , and the location of the point on the jet ( z@xmath43 ) beyond which a fraction of the leptons are accelerated to a power - law energy distribution ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "n@xmath39 , parametrized in terms of the eddington luminosity , determines the power initially input into the particles and magnetic field at the base of the jets . beyond the jet - base ,",
    "we assume that the jet plasma ( a ) accelerates mildly due to longitudinal pressure gradient with its bulk lorentz factor asymptotically reaching a value of 23 far downstream along the jet , ( b ) expands laterally with its initial sound speed , and ( c ) cools due to adiabatic expansion .",
    "once the initial conditions are specified , then the bulk speed of the jet plasma , magnetic field , and particle density are computed by solving the adiabatic , relativistic euler equation @xcite .",
    "we note that in agn , a combination of higher powers , confinement and perhaps stronger magnetic field pressures may give higher bulk lorentz factors .",
    "the accretion disk is modeled as a multi - color blackbody with radial temperature profile t@xmath45r@xmath46 @xcite , and is parametrized by t@xmath47 , r@xmath47 , the temperature and radius at the inner edge of the disc .",
    "the thermal photons from the accretion disc are also included in the photon field of the jet for compton scattering , although due to doppler redshifting in the jet frame , this external compton emission is usually much smaller than the synchrotron self - compton .    given the various uncertainties involved , e.g. , in our understanding of the cause of the large x - ray variability , non - simultaneity of data from different wavelengths ( except for the vla / evla data and the _ chandra _ data , which were obtained simultaneously ) , contribution to the optical / uv flux from non - agn components , dust heating , etc .",
    ", a detailed statistical comparison between the data and the model would yield errors which will significantly underestimate the systematic uncertainties . in other words ,",
    "the uncertaintites involved are much larger than simply the deviation of model prediction from the data .",
    "therefore the best - match model here is ` @xmath48-by - eye ' , and is shown by the line labeled ` total ' in fig .  [ f : sed ] . in fig .",
    "[ f : sed_pars ] we show the model variability when one of the parameters was varied by @xmath2310% and @xmath2320% from the best - match model while the remaining parameter values were fixed to those of the best - match model .    we adopted a distance of 10 mpc @xcite and the recently revised reverberation mass estimate of 1.7@xmath3710@xmath49 m@xmath9@xcite for ngc 4051 . the outer radius of the accretion disc is not constrained by the data and was arbitrarily set to a value of @xmath50 @xmath1 .",
    "the remaining parameters were obtained from the best - match to the data .",
    "assuming that the radio originates in an optically thick , stratified jet , a comparison of the radio and _",
    "spitzer_/irs fluxes immediately shows that the _ spitzer _  fluxes are at least an order of magnitude higher than the expected jet flux .",
    "the large slit - width of the irs ( 3.6 ) is primarily responsible for this .",
    "the high spatial - resolution gemini / nifs spectrum , shows that the agn contribution is much less .    the soft x - ray continuum , obtained with _ chandra _  simultaneously with the 8.4 ghz _ vla_/_evla _",
    "observations @xcite , shows much more variability both in the power law index and normalization .",
    "such variations could arise due to rapid changes in the particle energisation / acceleration / cooling processes occurring in small `` knots '' in the post - shock region of the jet , e.g. , as seen in the blazar bl lacertae by @xcite . a full understanding of particle acceleration in such jets is still lacking ; here we use a particle energy distribution index @xmath51=2.7  which matches the observed @xmath3110@xmath52 hz sed quite well if the observed euv and x - ray emission is largely due to optically thin synchrotron .",
    "the jet inclination was taken to be 50 .",
    "while not strongly constrained by the data , a much lower value ( @xmath5340 ) of the inclination would cause a larger fraction of the doppler - boosted synchrotron photons from the outer parts of the jet to overestimate the radio flux .",
    "inclinations greater than @xmath060are similarly not preferred .",
    "we note that this inclination is same as the results by @xcite , who modeled the narrow - line region of ngc 4051  as an outflowing biconical region of inclination 50 , thus suggesting that the relativistic jet as well as the much slower outflowing narrow - line region are co - aligned .",
    "since we assume a symmetric model where the jets are perpendicular to the accretion disc , this means that the inclination to the disc normal is also 50 .",
    "since the radio data do not show any hint of low - energy cutoff , the minimum length of the jet was set to 0.3 parsec , which is the upper limit for the source radius of the central component detected by @xcite using vlbi .",
    "also , while searching for the best - match model more weight was given to the vla a configuration data point of @xcite since that observation had the highest spatial resolution as well as the smallest error bar of all the radio observations presented in that paper .",
    "the equipartition factor ( @xmath41 ) is not strongly constrained by the data , although we could not obtain good matches either for @xmath54 or for @xmath55 , pointing toward a near - equipartition model .",
    "we therefore set @xmath41=1 .",
    "in addition to the jet , an accretion disk with r@xmath47=130  @xmath1  and t@xmath47=2.8@xmath56  k is required to model the sed .",
    "this however assumes that the entire optical and uv emission is from the accretion disc . as discussed in ",
    "[ s : conclusion ] ( and perhaps as evidenced from the pah lines in the _ spitzer_/irs spectrum ) , some of the uv emission could be from an actively star - forming nuclear star cluster .",
    "some of the optical / uv radiation could also be due to reprocessing of the x - rays from the jet base by the outer accretion disk , as suggested by the time - lags reported in @xcite .",
    "therefore the inner disc radius obtained here is more realistically an upper limit on the actual radius .",
    "the pre - shock synchrotron is the emission from the base / launching region of the jet .",
    "while the data does not constrain it directly in this case ( see , e.g. , the solid orange curve in fig .",
    "[ f : sed ] ) , the physical conditions at the base determine the nature of the flow farther downstream along the jet in the model . in order to produce the observed radio emission ( which arises in the optically thick , post - shock synchrotron regime ) and the x - rays ( which in our model are originating mainly in a region close to the base where the a fraction of the thermal leptons are accelerated to a non - thermal powerlaw distribution ) , only certain physical conditions and geometries of the base are allowed , and these choices ( r@xmath42=4@xmath1 , h@xmath42/r@xmath42=1 , t@xmath40=4@xmath57  k , z@xmath43=5  @xmath1 ) lead to the observed pre - shock synchrotron emission .",
    "an input jet power of 1.7@xmath58  l@xmath18 , initially input into the particles and magnetic field at the base of the jets , is needed to match the broadband sed .",
    "the inverse compton component ( solid blue line in fig .",
    "[ f : sed ] ) is also not strongly required by the data , however it is computed self - consistently by the model and we include it in the plot to show that the x - ray emission is indeed dominated by synchrotron radiation and not by inverse comptonization .",
    "we also tried models where the high energy is primarily dominated by inverse compton scattering .",
    "however , within the framework of jet models , an ic - dominated model requires very extreme and rather unphysical parameters ( e.g. , r@xmath42@xmath29@xmath1 , and h@xmath42/r@xmath42@xmath3120 ) for the x - rays , and is still unable to model the euve flux .",
    "therefore we favor a synchrotron origin for the euve and soft x - ray flux .",

    "similarly it is not possible to strongly constrain the equipartition factor in this case , but models near equipartition or slightly magnetically dominated models are preferred .",
    "the location of the region where acceleration starts ( z@xmath43@xmath05@xmath1  in this case ) is still a free parameter in the model .",
    "recent calculations by @xcite have indicated that it is possible to self - consistently derive the location of this acceleration region within the self - similar magnetohydrodynamical approximation proposed by @xcite .",
    "once gravity is incorporated into this new calculation , we will be able to reduce the number of free parameters significantly in future versions of the jet model ( polko et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .      the high variability of the x - rays and the extreme - uv , and the fact that they are simultaneous to within 1 ksec @xcite suggests a common origin for these two bandpasses .",
    "the variability of the optical and lower frequencies is much smaller . in the framework of our model ,",
    "the euv and x - rays originate in a compact jet close to the central black hole .",
    "the observed high variability is expected both because of the small size of the emission region and relativistic beaming due to bulk motion of the jet plasma .",
    "the optical , on the other hand , originates from a much larger region in the accretion disc , and therefore exhibits much lower variability .",
    "the energy distribution index of the shocked leptons ( @xmath60 ) obtained here is somewhat steeper than the values predicted e.g. by diffusive shock process @xcite .",
    "it is however possible that for ngc 4051  the euve and x - ray bandpasses are at a higher energy than the cooling break energy , where the particle energy distribution steepens from @xmath51 to @xmath61 due to enhanced cooling .",
    "if the cooling break is indeed at a frequency lower than the euve , an immediate effect of this would be to move the optically - thick - to - optically - thin transition , currently in the @xmath01015 micron range , to submm wavelengths ( where this break has been seen for the llagns sgr a@xmath62 [ @xcite ] , and m81@xmath62 [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "since the location of the cooling break is dependent on time as well as particle injection / acceleration rate , some of the observed variability could also be attributed to cooling .",
    "@xcite have noted that above @xmath595 kev there may be a tendency for the rms variability to decrease with increasing energy .",
    "x - ray flux in our model originates in the optically thin synchrotron from a distribution of shocked particles beyond z@xmath43 .",
    "the spatial extent of such shocks may be small , and the x - ray variability could be due to rapid changes in particle energisation , e.g , perhaps due to magnetic reconnection events . while the soft x - rays ( @xmath291020 kev ) originate mainly due to this `` post - shock '' synchrotron , it is possible that inverse compton scattering ( of synchrotron photons produced at the base of the jet ( ssc ) as well as that of the soft photons from the accretion disc ) becomes dominant at @xmath3120 kev . assuming a reasonably constant mass accretion rate by the disc , and a constant fraction of mass channeled into the jets ,",
    "the variability of this ic component would be small , and would largely reflect the ( more slowly occurring ) changes in mass accretion rate .",
    "the simultaneous _ chandra _  and _ vla _  data presented by @xcite suggest that during their 20082009 campaign ngc 4051  shows an anti - correlation between x - rays and radio .",
    "another recent work by @xcite , using _",
    "rxte _ and _ vla _",
    "observations made during 20002001 , found a weak positive correlation between radio and x - ray fluxes .",
    "the origin of the anti - correlation observed by @xcite is still not clear ; however this may be due to the following two reasons : ( a ) given the uncertainties in the bulk speed of the jet plasma , the simultaneous ( as observed by us ) radio and x - ray fluxes may not be causally connected , and ( b ) as multiwavelength monitoring results of sgr a * show ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there seems to be no tight correlation between the x - ray and radio flares . in sgr",
    "a * the optically thin nir / x - ray flares most likely trace particle acceleration/(re)energization and cooling very close to the black hole , which only marginally affects the optically thick radio flux @xcite .",
    "changes in radio flux on the other hand are mainly driven by adiabatic expansion of overdensities in the outflow @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that ngc 4051  is in a transitional phase between hard and soft states , where the radio emission is in the process of getting quenched .",
    "while comparing with xrbs one must however keep in mind that the observed `` quenching '' of xrb jets may not mean that the jets have actually turned off .",
    "it is possible that xrbs jets may only appear quenched because they have become quite weak and the sensitivity is not enough to detect them .",
    "the presence of a separate mode for the disk  jet coupling ( i.e. , separate from the coupling which gives rise to the fundamental plane relation ) operating in ngc 4051  during the @xcite observations can not be ruled out either .",
    "our modeling suggests that the inner edge of the accretion disk is @xmath0130@xmath1 .",
    "given that the model luminosity is @xmath0@xmath63l@xmath18 , a large r@xmath47  is not unreasonable .",
    "the profile of the iron k@xmath64 emission line near 6.4 kev ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose origin is generally attributed to hard x - rays irradiating the relatively colder accretion disc @xcite , is quite narrow and does not show strong relativistic broadening , further suggesting that the accretion disc may be truncated at a large radius .",
    "however , by comparing the observed variability in the reflection features seen in the x - ray data with reflection models that include light - bending , @xcite have suggested a much smaller inner edge radius ( within a few @xmath1 ) .",
    "we would like to point out that our estimation of the disc s r@xmath47assumes that the optical , uv , and fuv light are entirely coming from the accretion disc .",
    "however , ongoing star formation , as evidenced by the pah lines in the _ spitzer _  spectrum , may contribute some fraction ( although most likely not a large fraction ; see below ) of the light that we are currently attributing to the disc .",
    "any ( presumably small ) contribution from star formation will reduce the disc contribution , which in turn will likely imply a smaller disc - truncation radius ( assuming that t@xmath47  of the accretion disk , which determines the peak of the optical / uv sed , is not changing ) .",
    "an additional contributor to the optical and uv flux is reprocessing of the more energetic euv / x - rays from near the central black hole .",
    "a recent work studying the long - term optical and x - ray light curves of ngc 4051  by @xcite hints at a lag of @xmath65 days , with the optical lagging behind the x - rays , thus favoring a reprocessing origin . on the other hand",
    ", results by @xcite suggest that part of the optical leads the x - ray by @xmath02.4 days . based on their detailed reprocessing model @xcite concluded that there seems to be no common origin for the observed x - ray / optical variability , and that not all of the observed optical variability can be attributed to reprocessing .",
    "contribution by reprocessing would tend to lower the disk r@xmath47 .",
    "therefore the r@xmath47deduced here should perhaps more realistically be seen as an upper limit on the actual inner radius .",
    "an independent measurement of the inner radius may come from a self - consistent modeling of the soft excess in this source . while the true nature of the soft excess is still debated ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a survey of 34 type 1 agns by @xcite and detailed spectral and timing analysis of the nls1 galaxy 1h0707 - 495 by @xcite and @xcite showed that the soft excess can be well modeled by relativistically blurred photoionized disc reflection model .",
    "assuming a maximally rotating kerr black hole , disc reflection model fits to _ xmm - newton _  data of ngc 4051  by @xcite give an inner disc radius of @xmath01.24@xmath1 .",
    "a more physical treatment of the scenario , where the x - ray emission from the jet - base ( which can act as a source of irradiation ) is self - consistently used to compute disc reflection features , would help in understanding soft excess seen in the source .",
    "if the inner disc radius is indeed close to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) as suggested by the reflection model fits , this would require most of the flux , which is attributed to the accretion disc in this model , to have a non - disc origin .",
    "the _ hst_/stis spectrum given in figure 6 of @xcite suggests that the continuum flux between 12001700  is approximately constant at f@xmath66@xmath672@xmath3710@xmath68 erg @xmath26 s@xmath25 @xmath25 , implying an observed isotropic luminosity l@xmath69=1.2@xmath3710@xmath70 ( d/10 mpc)@xmath71 erg s@xmath25 . in order to estimate the contribution from stellar flux at these wavelengths we used the synthetic seds of simple stellar populations published by @xcite .",
    "we used a model sed with @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) , solar metallicity , and red horizontal branch morphology ( hbm ) .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the blue / uv photons , the main factor that affects the luminosity is age , and influence of other factors ( imf , metallicity , hbm ) are comparatively much smaller . for the chosen set of parameters , the @xcite models give seds as a function of the age of the stellar population . given the shape of the stis continuum , a relatively young age of @xmath00.1 gyr is needed .",
    "integrating the 0.1 gyr maraston model between 12001700   gives a model luminosity of l@xmath72=3.25@xmath3710@xmath73 erg s@xmath25 .",
    "therefore l@xmath69/l@xmath74 .",
    "since the maraston models are normalized to 1 m@xmath9 , this implies that @xmath037 million young stars would be needed within the stis aperture in order to have the same luminosity .",
    "such a stellar concentration , while not implausibly large , is still at the high end of what has been observed in globular clusters and in nuclear star clusters ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however there is a very important issue here that we have not considered : in reality it is well known that the stars in globular clusters are quite old , and so are the stars in the bulge .",
    "nuclear star clusters typically consist of a somewhat older stellar population . according to the @xcite models , the number of stars needed to produce the stis observed luminosity would have to be increased by 4 orders of magnitude if the stellar population was 1 gyr old , instead of the assumed 0.1 gyr . on the other hand , recent results from _",
    "spitzer _",
    "spectroscopy by @xcite show strong pah emission at 6.2@xmath12 m from narrow line seyferts , indicating ongoing star formation within the circumnuclear region included inside the irs s slit - width ( 3.6 ) .",
    "clearly , high - resolution mir observations would be required to better understand ongoing star - formation in the nuclear region of nlss .",
    "the variability seen in the optical wavelengths however argues against a scenario where stellar emission dominates the total observed optical flux . based on our modeling",
    ", @xmath2910% of the _ spitzer _  observed flux is due to the jet .",
    "the jet contribution is higher in the 0.1  _",
    "gemini_spectrum , but still appears to be dominated by sources other than the accretion disk and the jet .",
    "the results of modeling the broadband sed of ngc 4051 , along with similar results from modeling stellar mass black holes as well as low - luminosity agns like sagittarius a@xmath62 and m81@xmath62 , broadly suggest that the underlying physical mechanism driving accretion inflows and outflows do not depend on the mass of the accretor and rather most of the observed properties scale with mass .",
    "evidence for the presence of this mass - scaling is not only seen in broadband spectral modeling and the existence of the fundamental plane , but also in various other recent observations which include ( but are not limited to ) detection of quasi - periodic oscillations in the nls1 galaxy re  j1034@xmath75396 @xcite , variability ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , frequency - dependent lags between energy bands ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , iron line and other associated disc reflection features ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to note that recent x - ray and optical observations of gravitationally lensed quasars rx  j11311231 and he  11041805 suggest that the x - ray emitting region of these quasars are quite compact ( @xmath010@xmath1  or smaller ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as our modeling of ngc 4051  presented here shows , such a compact region of emission is expected if the x - rays are produced at the base of a jet .",
    "typically the inner disc radius is close to that of the isco in xrbs in soft state , whereas the inner - disc radius we obtain here is much larger and more characteristic of hard state xrbs where the disc is truncated ( although the radius we obtain is most likely an upper limit as discussed above , but otherwise it would require a rather improbably high number of extremely young stars to produce the observed uv flux ) .",
    "based on our modeling , the continuum luminosity of the accretion disk is @xmath76 erg s@xmath25 ( @xmath00.3%l@xmath18 ) and the isotropic luminosity from the power law component between 10@xmath5210@xmath77 hz is @xmath78 erg s@xmath25 ( 0.6% l@xmath18 , about twice the disk flux ) .",
    "integrating the broadband model flux between 10@xmath7910@xmath77 hz and assuming isotropic emission gives a luminosity of @xmath80 erg s@xmath25 or @xmath01.1% l@xmath18 , in good agreement with the bolometric luminosity obtained with the @xmath22 ( 5100  ) relation .",
    "therefore , while the timing properties of ngc 4051  are similar to soft state xrbs , the sed and luminosities are more akin to hard state xrbs .",
    "thus it is unclear if the xrb state definitions can be straightforwardly carried over to agns , or if perhaps ngc 4051  is in a transitional phase between hard and soft states",
    ".    it would be interesting to test whether outflow - dominated models can explain the sed of other seyfert galaxies ( maitra et al . in prep . ) . as shown in this work , isolating the agn emission from starburst , dust etc .",
    "is one of the biggest challenges for this project ; and it is only in the very nearby seyferts that we currently have the required resolution and sensitivity to see these relatively weak jets",
    ". the enhanced sensitivity of the evla at radio frequencies , and alma in millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths will soon provide data with unprecedented sensitivity and coverage , zooming into the heart of the central engines of the nearby agns to study accretion / ejection processes in much greater detail than before .",
