    "the distribution of the eigenvalues of a quantum hamiltonian is a central subject that is studied in quantum chaos .",
    "there are some generally accepted conjectures about the nearest - neighbor spacing distributions of the eigenvalues .",
    "unless otherwise stated we use the following assumptions : the quantum mechanical system is desymmetrized with respect to all its unitary symmetries , and whenever we examine the distribution of the eigenvalues we regard them on the scale of the mean level spacings .",
    "moreover , it is generically believed that after desymmetrization a generic quantum hamiltonian possesses no degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "if the corresponding classical system is integrable , the eigenvalues behave like independent random variables and the distribution of the nearest - neighbor spacings is close to the poisson distribution , i.e. there is no level repulsion .",
    "[ then : conj : bgs ] if the corresponding classical system is chaotic , the eigenvalues are distributed like the eigenvalues of hermitian random matrices @xcite .",
    "the corresponding ensembles depend only on the symmetries of the system :    * for chaotic systems without time - reversal invariance the distribution of the eigenvalues should be close to the distribution of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) which is characterized by a quadratic level repulsion . * for chaotic systems with time - reversal invariance and integer",
    "spin the distribution of the eigenvalues should be close to the distribution of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) which is characterized by a linear level repulsion . * for chaotic systems with time - reversal invariance and half - integer spin",
    "the distribution of the eigenvalues should be close to the distribution of the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) which is characterized by a quartic level repulsion .",
    "these conjectures are very well confirmed by numerical calculations , but several exceptions are known . here are two examples :    the harmonic oscillator is classically integrable , but its spectrum is equidistant .",
    "the geodesic motion on surfaces with constant negative curvature provides a prime example for classical chaos . in some cases",
    ", however , the nearest - neighbor distribution of the eigenvalues of the laplacian on these surfaces appears to be poissonian .    ``",
    "a strange arithmetical structure of chaos '' in the case of surfaces of constant negative curvature that are generated by arithmetic fundamental groups was discovered by aurich and steiner @xcite , see also aurich , bogomolny , and steiner @xcite .",
    "deviations from the expected goe - behaviour in the case of a particular arithmetic surface were numerically observed by bohigas , giannoni , and schmit @xcite and by aurich and steiner @xcite .",
    "computations coming out in @xcite showed , however , that the level statistics on @xmath0 generic ( i.e. non - arithmetic ) surfaces were in nice agreement with the expected random - matrix theory prediction in accordance with conjecture [ then : conj : bgs ] .",
    "this has led bogomolny , georgeot , giannoni , and schmit @xcite , bolte , steil , and steiner @xcite , and sarnak @xcite to introduce the concept of arithmetic quantum chaos .    on surfaces of constant negative curvature that are generated by arithmetic fundamental groups ,",
    "the distribution of the eigenvalues of the quantum hamiltonian are close to the poisson distribution .",
    "due to level clustering small spacings occur comparably often .",
    "we compute numerically the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the laplacian that describes the quantum mechanics of a point particle moving freely in the non - integrable three - dimensional hyperbolic space of constant negative curvature generated by the picard group .",
    "the picard group is arithmetic and we find that our results are in accordance with the conjecture of arithmetic quantum chaos .    for the definition of an arithmetic group we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we first introduce the topology and geometry of the two - dimensional surface of constant negative curvature that is generated by the modular group @xcite . it will then be easy to carry over to the three - dimensional space of constant negative curvature that is generated by the picard group .",
    "the construction begins with the upper half - plane , @xmath1 equipped with the hyperbolic metric of constant negative curvature @xmath2 a free particle on the upper half - plane moves along geodesics , which are straight lines and semicircles perpendicular to the @xmath3-axis , respectively , see figure [ then : fig : then_1 ] .    expressing a point @xmath4 as a complex number @xmath5 , all isometries of the hyperbolic metric",
    "are given by the group of linear fractional transformations , @xmath6 which is isomorphic to the group of matrices @xmath7 up to a common sign of the matrix entries , @xmath8    in analogy to the concept of a fundamental cell in a regular lattice of a crystal we can introduce a fundamental domain of a discrete group @xmath9 .",
    "a fundamental domain of the discrete group @xmath10 is an open subset @xmath11 with the following conditions : the closure of @xmath12 meets each orbit @xmath13 at least once , @xmath12 meets each orbit @xmath14 at most once , and the boundary of @xmath12 has lebesgue measure zero .",
    "if we choose the group @xmath10 to be the modular group , @xmath15 which is generated by a translation and an inversion , @xmath16 the fundamental domain of standard shape is @xmath17 see figure [ then : fig : then_2 ] .",
    "the isometric copies of the fundamental domain @xmath18 , tessellate the upper half - plane completely without any overlap or gap , see figure [ then : fig : then_3 ] .    identifying",
    "the fundamental domain @xmath12 and parts of its boundary with all its isometric copies @xmath19 , defines the topology to be the quotient space @xmath20 .",
    "the quotient space @xmath20 can also be thought of as the fundamental domain @xmath12 with its faces glued according to the elements of the group @xmath10 , see figure [ then : fig : then_4 ] .",
    "any function being defined on the upper half - plane which is invariant under linear fractional transformations , @xmath21 can be identified with a function living on the quotient space @xmath20 . a function on the quotient space is tantamount to a function on the fundamental domain with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "vice versa , any function being defined on the quotient space can be identified with an automorphic function , @xmath22 , living on the upper half - plane .    with the hyperbolic metric the quotient space @xmath20 inherits the structure of an orbifold .",
    "an orbifold locally looks like a manifold , with the exception that it is allowed to have elliptic fix - points .",
    "the orbifold of the modular group has one parabolic and two elliptic fix - points , @xmath23 the parabolic one fixes a cusp at @xmath24 which is invariant under the parabolic element @xmath25 hence the orbifold of the modular group is non - compact .",
    "the volume element corresponding to the hyperbolic metric reads @xmath26 such that the volume of the orbifold @xmath20 is finite , @xmath27    scaling the units such that @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the stationary schrdinger equation which describes the quantum mechanics of a point particle moving freely in the orbifold @xmath20 becomes @xmath30 where the hyperbolic laplacian is given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the scaled energy .",
    "we can relate the the eigenvalue problem defined on the orbifold @xmath20 to the eigenvalue problem defined on the upper - half space , with the eigenfunctions being subject to the automorphy condition relative to the discrete group @xmath10 , @xmath33 in order to avoid solutions that grow exponentially in the cusp , we impose the boundary condition @xmath34 where @xmath35 is some positive constant .",
    "the solutions of this eigenvalue problem can be identified with maass waveforms @xcite .",
    "the identification is worthwhile , since much is known about maass waveforms from number theory and harmonic analysis which will simplify their computation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in the three - dimensional case one considers the upper - half space , @xmath36 equipped with the hyperbolic metric @xmath37 the geodesics of a particle moving freely in the upper half - space are straight lines and semicircles perpendicular to the @xmath38-@xmath39-plane , respectively , see figure [ then : fig : then_5 ] .    expressing any point @xmath40 as a hamilton quaternion , @xmath41 , with the multiplication defined by @xmath42 , all motions in the upper half - space are given by linear fractional transformations @xmath43 the group of these transformations is isomorphic to the group of matrices @xmath44 up to a common sign of the matrix entries , @xmath45 the motions provided by the elements of @xmath46 exhaust all orientation preserving isometries of the hyperbolic metric on @xmath47 .",
    "if one wants to avoid using quaternions , the point @xmath40 can be expressed by @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "but then the linear fractional transformation look somewhat more complicated , @xmath51 in order to keep the notation simple we hence use quaternions .    we now choose the discrete group @xmath52 generated by the cosets of three elements , @xmath53 which yield two translations and one inversion , @xmath54 this group @xmath10 is called the picard group .",
    "the three motions generating @xmath10 , together with the coset of the element @xmath55 that is isomorphic to the symmetry @xmath56 can be used to construct the fundamental domain of standard shape latexmath:[\\ ] ] where the fourier coefficients @xmath210 of the hecke eigenfunctions are given by @xmath211 and the index @xmath212 at the fourier coefficients of the maass cusp forms @xmath213 means that they belong to the fourier expansion of the @xmath212-th maass cusp form @xmath214 .",
    "if @xmath215 is a hecke eigenfunction that does not vanish identically , then :    \\(i ) its first fourier coefficient is never zero , @xmath216 .",
    "\\(ii ) a hecke eigenfunction can not be of symmetry class @xmath123 or @xmath125 .",
    "\\(iii ) hecke eigenfunctions can always be desymmetrized such that they fall either into the symmetry class @xmath217 or @xmath218 .",
    "let @xmath214 be a maass cusp form of the symmetry class @xmath123 or @xmath125 .",
    "due to steil s lemma , it can not be a hecke eigenfunction .",
    "since one can diagonalize the laplacian and the hecke operators simultaneously , there have to exist linearly independent maass cusp forms @xmath219 corresponding to the same eigenvalue @xmath143 such that @xmath220 is a hecke eigenfunction .",
    "at least one of these maass cusp forms has to be of the symmetry class @xmath122 or @xmath124 in order that @xmath221 does not vanish .    since the hecke eigenfunctions can be desymmetrized such that they fall into the symmetry class @xmath217 resp .",
    "@xmath218 they are a superposition of either maass cusp forms of the symmetry classes @xmath122 and @xmath123 or of maass cusp forms of the symmetry classes @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath214 is of symmetry class @xmath123 one of the @xmath222 is of symmetry class @xmath122 , and if @xmath214 is of symmetry class @xmath125 one of the @xmath222 is of symmetry class @xmath124 .",
    "based on our numerical results we now conjecture the following :    taking all four symmetry classes together , there are no degenerate eigenvalues other than those explained by steil s theorem .",
    "furthermore , the degenerate eigenvalues which are explained by steil s theorem occur only in pairs of two degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "they never occur in pairs of three or more degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "maass cusp forms of the symmetry classes @xmath123 and @xmath125 indeed occur . on the one hand we have found a number of them numerically . on the other hand , weyl s law also explains their existence . due to this",
    "the number of eigenvalues whose corresponding maass cusp forms belong to a specific symmetry class is in leading order independent of the choice of the symmetry class .",
    "weyl s law together with steil s theorem lead to the following :    the sequence of non - degenerate eigenvalues in the spectrum of the laplacian for the picard group is of density zero .",
    "this means that as @xmath223 @xmath224 table [ then : firstfeweigenvalues ] looks as if it would contradict this conjecture .",
    "but this is due to the fact that only the first few eigenvalues are listed . in table",
    "[ then : somelargeeigenvalues ] we list some consecutive large eigenvalues where we can see a better agreement with the conjecture .    @xmath225",
    "our principal goal was to test the conjecture of arithmetic quantum chaos numerically in one example . for this purpose",
    "we have chosen a point particle moving freely in the three - dimensional and negatively curved quotient space of the picard group . identifying the solutions of the stationary schrdinger equation with maass waveforms allowed us to use hejhal s algorithm to compute the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues numerically .",
    "having computed @xmath157 eigenvalues ( and eigenfunctions ) , which exceeds all previous computations in non - integrable three - dimensional systems , we demonstrated that our numerical results are in accordance with the conjecture of arithmetic quantum chaos . within each symmetry class",
    "we do not find any degenerate eigenvalues , but taking all four symmetry classes together , almost all eigenvalues become degenerate in the limit of large eigenvalues @xmath223 .",
    "this behaviour was explained by the interplay of the symmetries with the hecke - operators .",
