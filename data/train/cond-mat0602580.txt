    ". however , the way the interaction with the thermal bath is taken into account in the original jarzynski s demonstration has been criticized  @xcite : the interaction is assumed to be weak enough to be neglected .",
    "it means that the system can not exchange heat with the bath .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) was thus claimed to fail since one expects that the system tends to relax to an equilibrium state by exchanging heat with the bath .",
