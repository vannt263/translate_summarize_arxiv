    "the cosmic ray spectrum is usually described by a superposition of power laws with index @xmath5 below and @xmath6 above the so - called `` knee '' at a few @xmath0ev . in the region of @xmath7",
    "ev the spectrum flattens , and has an index again close to @xmath8 .",
    "there are also suggestions that the shape of the spectrum in the knee region has a fine structure which may reflect acceleration of specific groups of nuclei , e.g helium , oxygen , and iron , prominent in the galactic abundances ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recent experimental results show that the cosmic ray composition changes through the knee region of the spectrum , becoming heavier with increasing energy @xcite .",
    "for example , the casa - mia experiment measures the mass composition in the energy range @xmath9 ev @xcite , and shows that above @xmath0 ev the iron group nuclei should dominate .",
    "the analysis of hybrid data from the high resolution fly s eye prototype and the mia muon array indicates that the mass composition becomes lighter again in the region @xmath10",
    "ev @xcite , and is proton dominated at around @xmath11 ev @xcite .    it is usually argued that cosmic rays with energies below @xmath12 ev are accelerated at shocks of expanding supernovae ( see e.g. ref .",
    "it seems that the acceleration mechanism of the higher energy cosmic rays may be different , although supernova shocks of various types have also been proposed @xcite and also lead to fine structure in the spectrum and composition in the knee region @xcite .",
    "this idea is consistent with the recently observed variation in the composition of cosmic rays in the region @xmath13ev mentioned above .",
    "however , it is uncertain what fraction of the cosmic rays above @xmath12 ev , are actually accelerated by supernova shocks , and so other mechanisms able to accelerate cosmic rays , particularly heavy nuclei , to energies above @xmath0ev may be required .",
    "it has also been suggested that protons and heavy nuclei could be accelerated to such energies in pulsar winds @xcite .",
    "nuclei can be also accelerated in pulsar magnetospheres as discussed by cheng , ho & ruderman  @xcite , cheng & chi  @xcite and bednarek & protheroe  @xcite . in our previous work @xcite , we considered acceleration of iron nuclei in the magnetospheres of very young pulsars , and crab - type pulsars , in the context of @xmath14-ray and neutrino emission by supernova remnants .",
    "we found that , although the photo - disintegration process of iron nuclei during their acceleration and propagation through the neutron star magnetosphere is important , heavy nuclei would be injected into the medium of expanding supernova remnant . in the present paper",
    "we compute the possible contribution of nuclei injected by the galactic population of gamma - ray pulsars to the observed cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "we show that gamma - ray pulsars can contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum with energies above @xmath15 ev .",
    "neutron stars are likely to be born with initial periods @xmath16 ms if we assume that the angular momentum of the pre - supernova star is conserved during the collapse .",
    "however , the initial angular momentum may be lost in the case of hot rapidly rotating neutron stars by emission of gravitational radiation due to the r - mode instability @xcite . as a result",
    ", the star would be left with a period of about 10 ms at about 1 year after its formation .",
    "after that , the period of the neutron star would change , mainly as a result of emission of magnetic dipole radiation with power given by @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the surface magnetic field at the magnetic poles , @xmath19 is the radius of the neutron star , @xmath20 is the angle between rotational and magnetic axes , and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the period of the star .",
    "also , gravitational radiation may be important for the case of stars having significant ellipticity @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gravitational constant , @xmath26 is the moment of inertia @xcite .    we have investigated the population of young pulsars observed with age @xmath27 years ( about 100 pulsars ) from the catalogue of taylor , manchester & lyne  @xcite in order to estimate the neutron star ellipticity . by starting with an assumed initial period @xmath28  ms , perpendicular component of magnetic field @xmath29 , and ellipticity @xmath23 we may use eqs .",
    "[ eq1 ] and  [ eq2 ] giving the rate of loss of rotational kinetic by magnetic dipole radiation and gravitational radiation , respectively , to calculate the period @xmath22 and period derivative @xmath30 as a function of time since birth .",
    "for each of the young pulsars considered , and assuming standard values of @xmath26 and @xmath19 , and the inferred value of @xmath29 , we obtain the value of @xmath23 such that @xmath22 and @xmath30 match those observed  @xcite .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath23 obtained are rather insensitive to the assumed initial period for pulsars older than @xmath31 years .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .  1 , and show that a pulsar s ellipticity must be correlated with the perpendicular component of its surface magnetic field multiplied by its radius and divided by its moment of inertia . since the theoretical radii and masses of neutron stars lie in a rather narrow range , we conclude that there exists a correlation between the ellipticity and the surface magnetic field for neutron stars .",
    "the correlation coefficient obtained is equal to @xmath32 , which for 100 pulsars means that the correlation is highly significant .",
    "the inferred dependence of pulsar ellipticity on surface magnetic field can be well approximated by @xmath33 where @xmath18 is in gauss .",
    "the above result suggests that the ellipticity of a pulsar may be due to the deformation of the shape of the neutron star by its strong interior magnetic field ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the prescription for pulsar spin evolution we apply in our present work is based on eqs .",
    "[ eq1][eq3 ] .",
    "note , however , that in the case of some specific pulsars , the difference between the result from eq .  3 and estimates based on the known age of the pulsar is significant , e.g. , in the case of the crab pulsar for which the estimated ellipticity is @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "in the case of the recently - discovered pulsar in the historical ( ad 386 ) snr g11.2 - 03 , the standard formula  @xcite gives for the pulsar @xmath35 g , and using the historical age @xmath36 yr a pulsar initial period of @xmath37 ms is found @xcite . if gravitational radiation were included",
    ", the initial period could be much shorter .",
    "we find that for the same magnetic field , an ellipticity @xmath38 would give an initial period of 10  ms for ad 386 .",
    "this value of @xmath23 , together with @xmath39 g , is consistent with the correlation described by eq .  3 and seen in fig .  1",
    "periodic emission of photons from radio to @xmath14-ray energies gives direct evidence of the existence of electric potentials in neutron star magnetospheres which are able to accelerate particles to energies of at least @xmath40 gev .",
    "to explain these observations , a number of models have been proposed including the polar gap model , the slot gap model , and the outer gap model ( see e.g. arons  @xcite ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the outer gap model which is more attractive from the point of view of acceleration of nuclei by pulsars because it postulates induction of larger electric potentials in the pulsar s magnetosphere . the inner gap ( polar cap ) models ( e.g. ruderman & sutherland  @xcite , harding & muslinov  @xcite ) predict that the electric potentials induced in the inner gaps are significantly lower ( of the order of @xmath41 v ) , than expected in the outer gaps for pulsars with the same parameters .",
    "nuclei accelerated through such potentials would not suffer efficient photo - disintegration in collision with thermal photons with a characteristic temperature @xmath42 k emitted by the polar cap or from the whole surface of a classical radio pulsar ( only very young pulsars with ages of days to a month are sufficiently hot to photo - disintegrate fe nuclei  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we neglect this stage of pre - acceleration of fe nuclei during their passage through the inner gap . moreover , the inner and outer gaps do not need to extend along these same magnetic field lines , and so they do not need to be physically connected .",
    "nuclei , most probably iron nuclei , can be stripped off the hot surface of a neutron star due to the strong electric fields and the bombardment by particles produced in the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "this can occur where the magnetic and rotation axes are counter - aligned , and therefore where the co - rotation charge is positive above the poles , and can pull fe nuclei from the surface . if one assumes that pulsars have random orientations of these axes , then fe nuclei can be extracted from a significant fraction of pulsars , but if this is not the case then our results could be significantly affected .",
    "these nuclei are then accelerated by the pulsar outer gap electric field to high energies .",
    "we assume that the process of extraction of iron nuclei from the pulsar surface occurs during the @xmath14-ray emitting stage of the pulsar as the production of @xmath14-rays in the outer gap requires efficient production of relativistic @xmath43 plasma , and this also heats the polar cap region .",
    "chen & ruderman  @xcite distinguish two types of gamma - ray pulsars , so called crab - like ( crab - type ) and vela - like ( vela - type ) .",
    "beyond the vela - like death line the gap can not close , and this prevents copious production of secondary @xmath43 pairs , and causes efficient production of gamma - ray photons to cease",
    ". however , electric potentials inside the outer gap remain , and the acceleration of primary particles is still possible . in more recent papers ( romani  @xcite ; zhang & cheng  @xcite ; cheng & zhang  @xcite ) a third type of pulsar , so called geminga - like pulsars , is distinguished . in these pulsars the production of secondary @xmath43 pairs inside the outer gap is sustained by the soft x - ray emission from the polar cap region .",
    "the death line for geminga - like pulsars occurs when there is insufficient flux of thermal photons from the polar cap region of the pulsar .",
    "however , primary particles can be still accelerated inside the outer gap even after a pulsar has crossed the geminga - like death line ( only pair production stops ) .",
    "we expect that the injection of the fe nuclei from the region of the polar cap is related to the thermal radiation field produced by this region of the neutron star surface .",
    "the thermal radiation field drops significantly at a neutron star age @xmath42 yr ( see fig . 2 in romani  @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate that at this age the pulsar stops injecting fe nuclei into the magnetosphere .      during the @xmath14-ray production stage of pulsars ,",
    "three different types of outer gap can be distinguished , depending on the relative importance of different processes of @xmath14-ray production : the crab - type and vela - type gaps ( cheng , ho , ruderman  @xcite ) , and the geminga - type gap ( romani  @xcite , zhang & cheng  @xcite ) . the separation between the crab - type and the vela - type outer gaps depends on the pulsar period and surface magnetic field , and is given by eq .",
    "25 of chen & ruderman  @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the pulsar surface magnetic field in @xmath46 g , and the period @xmath47 is in seconds .",
    "the maximum potential difference across different types of outer gap can be approximated by the simple formula ( cheng  @xcite , private communication ) , @xmath48 this formula gives the potential drop in outer gaps a factor of two lower than derived in original paper by cheng , ho & ruderman  @xcite , and is more consistent with the recent works on the outer gap model  @xcite .",
    "however , we note that this simple formula may not match all observational data well because of uncertainties of viewing angle and inclination angle which are very important in determining the size of the outer gap . the parameter @xmath49 is used to parametrize the gap voltage and power , and is defined by cheng , ho & ruderman  @xcite    @xmath50    formulae ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) give the potential difference @xmath51 ev for the crab pulsar . for geminga - type gaps ( zhang & cheng  @xcite )",
    "@xmath52    for vela - type outer gaps a simple definition of the parameter @xmath49 is not available . we assume that in this case the potential drop in the outer gap is equal to a constant fraction of the total potential drop in the outer gap given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) with @xmath53 for all periods ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of the potential difference across the outer gap as a function of the pulsar period is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for three different values of the surface magnetic field of the pulsar .    according to cheng ,",
    "ho & ruderman  @xcite the potential drop across the gap depends also on the position of injection into the outer gap field , @xmath54 ( @xmath54 ranges between 0 and @xmath55 ) , in relation to the maximum gap width @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , we assume that the potential drop for position @xmath54 is given by ( see definitions below eq .  3.10 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath56 . \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      iron nuclei accelerated in the outer gap potential can suffer significant photo - disintegration in collisions with photons produced inside the gap .",
    "we estimate the density of soft photons inside outer gaps of pulsars with a given period and magnetic field by scaling from the density of soft photons inside the outer gap of the crab pulsar assuming the outer gap model .",
    "this density can be estimated from the observed pulsed flux of soft photons , assuming that the dimension of the outer gap is of the order of the light cylinder radius .",
    "ho  @xcite has shown , by analyzing a sample of crab - type pulsars with periods @xmath57  ms , that the luminosity of the photons produced in the gap does not change drastically for crab - type outer gaps . based on the results of ho  @xcite , we interpolate / extrapolate the density of photons in the present crab outer gap for other periods .",
    "the @xmath14-ray luminosity of pulsars scales as @xmath58 times the total spin down pulsar luminosity @xcite , and so the @xmath14-ray luminosity of the crab type pulsars depends on the magnetic field as @xmath59 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] ) , i.e. it is only very weakly dependent on @xmath18 . since energies of synchrotron photons are proportional to the magnetic field in the gap , then the photon density in crab - type outer gaps should be inversely proportional to the pulsars magnetic fields .",
    "we note that the observations seem to suggest that the @xmath14-ray luminosities of different types of pulsar are proportional to @xmath60 ( e.g. fig .  7 in arons",
    "@xcite ) , although different models predict different dependencies of @xmath14-ray luminosities on @xmath18 and @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "however the above dependence should be considered with some caution because it interpolates between the geminga pulsar ( and psr 1055 - 52 ) and the vela pulsar ( and its twin psr 1706 - 44 ) .",
    "the pulsar psr 1951 + 32 deviates by an order of magnitude and the crab pulsar by a factor of two , and if the distance to the vela pulsar is @xmath61 pc but not @xmath62 pc  @xcite , then vela pulsar deviates by a factor of four from this dependence . also , the distance to geminga pulsar is not well known .",
    "the density of soft photons in vela - type outer gaps is obtained based on the observed change of the pulsed luminosity of the vela type pulsars ( e.g. @xcite ) , and our estimate of @xmath49 in the case of vela - type pulsars , with the normalization to photon density in the crab - type outer gap at the transition period given by eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) . a good fit to the luminosity of the vela - type pulsars",
    "is obtained if the density of photons in the outer gap drops with period as @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we apply the following model for the soft photon density in crab and vela - type pulsars for different periods and surface magnetic fields @xmath64 where @xmath65 seconds , @xmath66 g and @xmath67 is the density of photons in the outer gap of the crab pulsar at present @xcite(cheng , ho & ruderman  1986 ) .",
    "the geminga - type outer gap is determined by the thermal photons produced on the neutron star surface .",
    "this thermal radiation field for pulsars with ages corresponding to geminga - type pulsars is too low to create a significant target for photo - disintegration of fe nuclei .",
    "the epoch of gamma - ray emission of geminga - type pulsars is determined by the temperature of the neutron star surface which , according to models of neutron star evolution , drops rapidly after @xmath42 years ( see e.g. fig .  2 in romani  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , geminga - type outer gaps should not be able to operate after @xmath42 years from the explosion of supernova . here",
    "we assume that the process of extraction of fe nuclei from the neutron star surface does not occur after this age because , as we noted above , it is probably caused by heating of the polar cap region by @xmath43 pairs created in the pulsar magnetosphere .      as in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we assume that the number of fe nuclei injected per unit time , @xmath68 , is simply related to the total power output of the pulsar @xmath69",
    "@xcite , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a free parameter describing the fraction of the total power taken by relativistic nuclei accelerated in the outer gap , @xmath72 is the atomic number of fe , and @xmath73 is defined by eq .",
    "the parameter @xmath71 has to be always less than one since the power of accelerated fe nuclei can never be greater than the spin - down power of the pulsar . the charge density estimated from eq .",

    "however , as noted by goldreich & julian  @xcite below their eq .",
    "( 8) , the above formula is only valid in the co - rotation portion of the magnetosphere .",
    "if there is additional negative current onto the surface accompanying the charge injected from the surface in the form of fe nuclei , then the above formula is not valid .",
    "positive charge may flow onto the surface along the same magnetic lines as fe nuclei , and could be produced somewhere in the pulsar magnetosphere , not necessary close to the pulsar s surface ( e.g. possibly in the outer gap ) .",
    "pair production just above the polar cap does not need to occur in this case .      as discussed above",
    ", we assume that all pulsars are born with periods of about 10 ms , or that they reach this period soon after formation by emission of gravitational waves due to the r - mode instability . as we argued in section  2 , pulsars need to have a significant ellipticity @xmath23 in order to reach their observed periods from a period at birth of 10 ms .",
    "the distribution of the pulsar magnetic fields can be evaluated from observations , assuming that the surface magnetic field does not decay significantly with pulsar age .",
    "for example , narayan  @xcite approximates the distribution of surface magnetic fields of pulsars at birth by @xmath76 for @xmath77 g. we estimate the distribution of pulsars with surface magnetic fields below @xmath78 g based on the fig .",
    "( 13 ) in narayan  @xcite .",
    "it is likely that this approximation underestimates the number of pulsars with relatively low magnetic fields because of observational selection effects .",
    "the above formula is normalized to a formation rate of pulsars in the galaxy equal to 1 per 70 years .",
    "nuclei extracted from the neutron star surface are accelerated and photo - disintegrated in the outer gap .",
    "their disintegration products , and those which escape without any disintegration , are injected into the nebula and lose energy in collisions with matter ejected during the supernova explosion , and as a result of the expansion of nebula .",
    "all these processes are discussed below .",
    "the importance of photo - disintegration of nuclei with different mass numbers during propagation of nuclei in the radiation field of the outer gap is determined by the reciprocal mean free path , which we calculate using cross sections of karakua & tkaczyk  @xcite ( with improvements given in ref .",
    "the results of such a calculation for an outer gap with parameters applicable to the crab pulsar are shown in fig .  1 of bednarek & protheroe  @xcite .",
    "it is evident that multiple photo - disintegrations of primary fe nuclei will occur for this pulsar . in our present calculations ,",
    "the photo - disintegration of nuclei in the thermal radiation field emitted by the pulsar surface is neglected since it may be only important during a few days after creation of the pulsar when its surface temperature is of the order of @xmath79 k @xcite , and consider only photodisintegration in the outer gap s non - thermal radiation field .",
    "we simulate the photo - disintegration process of nuclei accelerated by pulsars using the evolution model , initial parameters of pulsars , the outer gap model for acceleration , and the radiation field discussed in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "multiple photo - disintegrations occur only for pulsars with crab and vela - type outer gaps .",
    "we simulate the acceleration and propagation of iron nuclei in pulsar outer gaps in order to obtain the energy spectrum of neutrons and protons ( extracted from fe nuclei ) and the spectra of escaping secondary nuclei .",
    "note , however , that the fate of neutral particles ( neutrons ) and charged particles ( protons and secondary nuclei ) is different .",
    "the neutrons move ballistically through the surroundings of the pulsar , and decay at distances determined by their lorentz factors , and this can be inside or outside of the expanding envelope of the supernova .",
    "we compute the spectra of neutrons ( and so protons from their decay ) which decay inside and outside the nebula as in bednarek & protheroe @xcite . in the case of protons from neutrons decaying outside the nebula",

    "this term can be neglected since the minimum diffusion distance of these protons , with lorentz factor @xmath80 , in the galactic magnetic field @xmath81 g is comparable to the radius of nebula during its time of free expansion @xcite .    protons and secondary nuclei injected into the nebula",
    "are trapped by the magnetic field of the nebula , and suffer adiabatic and collisional energy losses during the time of expansion of the nebula .",
    "these effects are considered in the next subsection .",
    "soon after the supernova explosion , when the nebula was relatively small , nearly all the energetic neutrons would be expected to decay outside the nebula .",

    "the diffusion distance is obtained by integration over time from the injection of nuclei at @xmath139 up to escape at @xmath140 @xmath141 note that the diffusion coefficient depends on the age of the nebula , and this is included when integrating eq .",

    ", @xmath130 may be shorter than @xmath142 , and we then take @xmath143 .",
    "the adiabatic losses of particles inside nebula are considered up to the moment when the expansion velocity of the nebula during the sedov phase , @xmath144 , drops to a few tens km @xmath145 ( i.e. to the characteristic velocities of the clouds in the interstellar medium ) .",
    "this happens at the age of @xmath42 yr .",
    "note that at this age the magnetic field inside the nebula is larger than @xmath111 g only at small region above the radius of the shock ( @xmath146 , see fig .  3 ) .",
    "adiabatic and interaction energy losses of nuclei during the expansion of the nebula are included by estimating the lorentz factor of nuclei at arbitrary time , @xmath90 , @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the inelasticity coefficient , assumed equal to 0.5 for protons and neutrons . for nuclei with mass number @xmath131",
    ", we take the inelasticity coefficient to be @xmath149 since the probability of a collision of a single nucleon within the energetic nucleus , with a proton of the remnant nebula is , on average , proportional to @xmath150 .",
    "taking into account all of the effects discussed above , we compute the injection rate of nuclei of different mass numbers by the galactic population of pulsars into the interstellar medium , and this is given in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "the spectrum shows two distinct maxima corresponding to heavy nuclei ( dot - dot - dot - dash curve peaking at a few @xmath0ev ) and to protons ( solid curve peaking at @xmath151ev ) .",
    "the contribution of medium mass nuclei is visible at energies between the proton maximum and the heavy nuclei maximum .",
    "the main contribution to the spectrum of nuclei below the high - energy peak is from crab - type pulsars .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) in which we present the contribution of pulsars having different types of outer gap to the total spectrum of nuclei injected into the galaxy the from pulsars .",
    "the main contribution to the maximum at @xmath152  gev comes from vela - type and geminga - type pulsars .",
    "however the nuclei with the highest energies are injected by the vela and crab - type pulsars as expected from inspection of the electric potentials shown in fig .",
    "we assume that the radial distribution of the cosmic ray emission from gamma - ray pulsars follows the distribution of old neutron stars in the disk of the galaxy as given by paczynski @xcite @xmath153 with @xmath154 , @xmath155  kpc , and @xmath156 being the the distance from the centre of the galaxy of radius @xmath157  kpc , and that they are uniformly distributed in a disk of thickness @xmath158 .",

    "[ fig4](a ) , we obtain the spatial distribution of cosmic ray injection @xmath166    we assume that at energies above @xmath167  gev we can reasonably neglect interactions and energy losses of cosmic ray nuclei , and that diffusion is the dominant process in shaping the observed cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "we consider two different models ( ptuskin et al @xcite ) for propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy which are consistent with the observed secondary to primary ratios : ( i ) the minimal reacceleration model , and ( ii ) the standard diffusion model .",

    "@xcite , to calculate the cosmic ray density at earth assumed to be in the galactic plane 8  kpc from the centre of the galaxy .    the spectra after propagation are plotted in fig .  [ fig : propspec0 ] for the various species where they are compared with the world data set of observed cosmic ray intensity @xcite .",
    "[ fig : propspec0](a ) and ( b ) show results for the two propagation models .",

    "[ eq : d_kolmogorov ] and [ eq : d_standard ] , we note that the diffusion coefficients for the two propagation models are equal at @xmath176  gv , and this is within less than a factor of 2 of the rigidities of both the proton peak and the iron peak , and so the two propagation models will give almost identical fluxes for the same pulsar injection spectrum .",
    "the propagated fluxes are interestingly close to those observed , with the region between @xmath152  gev and @xmath177  gev being about @xmath178% of the observed flux .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : propspec0 ] , we can expect fine structure in the spectrum in the region of the knee , as well as subtle composition changes .",
    "our calculations were made assuming 100% efficiency of conversion of spin - down power into accelerated iron nuclei , i.e. @xmath179 in eq .",
    "[ eq11 ] . other uncertainties entering our calculation relate the propagation of cosmic rays .",
    "the diffusion coefficients assumed were based on an analysis of lower energy cosmic ray data , and their extrapolation to higher rigidities may be questionable .",
    "this would increase our predicted flux if the actual diffusion coefficient were lower . also , the pulsar formation rate is rather poorly known . with all these uncertainties , we feel justified is adopting @xmath180 in order see whether injection of cosmic rays accelerated in pulsar outer gaps could be potentially interesting .",
    "we shall next examine the composition in the knee region of the spectrum .",
    "the mass composition below @xmath15 ev is characterized by an average value of @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "if we assume that this component of the spectrum extends to higher energies , and add to it the contribution of heavy nuclei ( with average @xmath182 ) as obtained for our pulsar acceleration model , this would change the average value of @xmath183 to @xmath184 above the knee .",
    "such a change in @xmath183 has recently been reported for the casa - mia air shower array data @xcite .",
    "our calculations have assumed a steady - state production of pulsar - accelerated cosmic rays throughout the galaxy with a smooth spatial distribution of sources following that inferred for pulsars .",
    "it neglects the effect of relatively nearby sources , such as any within 1  kpc releasing cosmic rays during the past @xmath185  years which would enhance the pulsar contribution , and so the effects of pulsar acceleration on the cosmic ray composition could be even more dramatic .",
    "finally , we conclude that pulsar - accelerated cosmic rays could make a significant contribution of heavy nuclei to the cosmic rays observed in the knee region , and that this would manifest itself as fine structure in the spectrum , and a heavy composition at @xmath186@xmath177  gev .",
