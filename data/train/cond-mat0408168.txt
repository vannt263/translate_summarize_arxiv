    "<S> have been studied both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the interest in this systems stems form their potential applications to quantum and classical computing @xcite and their usefulness as model systems for the study of the physics of strongly correlated electrons.@xcite    in its simplest form , the kondo effect consists in the screening of a localized spin @xmath0 magnetic moment antiferromagnetically coupled to a conduction - electron band and appeared originally in the context of magnetic impurities in a metallic host . in a qd device coulomb repulsion and spatial confinement result in charge quantization and its transport properties </S>",
    "<S> are dominated by the coulomb blockade . when the charge on the qd is close to an odd integer the kondo efect takes place and it results in perfect transmission through the system at sufficiently low temperatures in a wide range of gate voltages .    when two dots are coupled , a richer and more complicated behavior may arise @xcite including the possibility of observing quantum phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in this paper we present a detailed study of a dqdd in which only one of the dots is coupled to the leads ( see figure [ fig : device ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the case in which the qds are very small and have a single relevant energy level at energies @xmath1 and @xmath2 and large charging energies @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where the indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the two dots . </S>",
    "<S> the position of energy levels of the dots and the strength of the coupling between them @xmath7 can be tuned by applying gate voltages in semiconductor devices . @xcite        the hamiltonian of the dqdd is @xmath8 where @xmath9- \\nonumber\\\\ & & t_{ab}\\sum_\\sigma \\left(d^\\dagger_{a\\sigma } d_{b\\sigma } + d^\\dagger_{b\\sigma } d_{a\\sigma}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] describes the @xmath10 molecule and @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of two non - interacting source and drain leads . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between the molecule and the leads is described by the last term in the hamiltonian , @xmath12    for symmetric leads , the conductance through the system is  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the local electronic density of states on dot @xmath5 . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electronic density of states of the electrodes at the fermi level , the brackets denote the average over the fermi surface , and @xmath17 is the fermi function .    </S>",
    "<S> we solved the above model using the numerical renormalization group technique as well as an approximate analytical method that reproduces the main features of the numerical solution . </S>",
    "<S> some exact results , that follow from the application of luttinger s theorem to this system , are also given .    </S>",
    "<S> our main findings are the following . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling @xmath7 is a relevant perturbation and the low - energy physics of the dqdd is fundamentally different from that of a single qd device . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - temperature conductance of the system vanishes when the total charge of the device is an even integer and it is perfect when the charge is an odd integer . </S>",
    "<S> this is an exact result .    </S>",
    "<S> when both dots are nearly half - filled there are two different regimes for the temperature - dependence of the conductance depending on whether @xmath7 is small or large in a sense that will be made precise below . for small @xmath7 , a two - stage analog of the kondo effect takes place with decreasing temperature . in the first stage , the magnetic moment of dot @xmath5 is quenched by the electrons of the leads below some temperature . in the second stage </S>",
    "<S> , that occurs at a much lower temperature , the magnetic moment of dot @xmath6 is in turn quenched by electrons that lie within the narrow kondo resonance around the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the two - stage kondo effect results in a non - monotonic behavior of the conductance as a function of both gate voltage and magnetic field . in the regime of large @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moments of the dots form a tightly bound singlet weakly coupled to the leads and the conductance varies monotonically at low temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> when the charge on the device is varied by application of a gate voltage @xmath18 , the zero - temperature conductance remains small in an extended interval of values of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , in general , nearly perfect conductance is only observed in a very restricted range of values of the gate voltage .    </S>",
    "<S> a surprisingly rich variety of possibilities exists for the dependence of the conductance upon gate voltage and temperature depending upon the various parameters of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : fermi ] we derive exact results for the dependence of the zero - temperature conductance of dqdd upon its charge and magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the model within slave - boson mean - field theory is presented in section [ sec : sbmft ] . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec : nrg ] contains the description of our numerical results . </S>",
