    "competing cdw order and superconductivity has also been demonstrated in the transition - metal dichalcogenide 2@xmath1-nbse@xmath2,@xcite which like the cuprates is quasi two - dimensional . with decreasing temperature , 2@xmath1-nbse@xmath2 undergoes an incommensurate cdw transition at @xmath7  k and becomes superconducting below @xmath8",

    "hence the quadrupolar interaction is relevant to a varying degree for all magnetic fields considered in our experiments .",
    "the strong temperature dependence of @xmath58 is indicative of thermally - activated hopping of the @xmath12 . with increasing temperature @xmath58 first decreases , likely due to the @xmath12 averaging over the distribution of fields it experiences during its lifetime as it moves from site to site ( a situation analogous to motional narrowing of the line width in nmr ) . above @xmath62",
    "k the increase of @xmath58 suggests that at these temperatures at least some of the @xmath12 move fast enough to reach sites near defects within their various lifetimes .",
    "consequently , the enhanced @xmath58 results from the muon ensemble sensing a broadened distribution of time - averaged magnetic fields .",
    "the plateau appearing above @xmath63  k suggests that at these higher temperatures the @xmath12 hop rate becomes very fast , such that most of the @xmath12 reach the vicinity of a defect very early in their lifetime  where they presumably experience a broader distribution of nuclear dipole fields .",

    "this suggests that the @xmath12 is sensitive to static cdw order up to temperatures nearly 3 times the cdw phase transition temperature @xmath5  consistent with the stm study of ref .  , which as mentioned earlier shows nanometer - size regions of static cdw order in the vicinity of defects at the surface of the sample in the temperature range @xmath75 .",
