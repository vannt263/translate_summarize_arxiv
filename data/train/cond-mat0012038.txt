    "in order to access the energy exchange rates among quasiparticles , we have measured the distribution function @xmath2 in a stationary out - of - equilibrium set - up @xcite , described in fig .",
    "[ figsetup ] .",
    "we consider a mesoscopic metallic wire placed between two ideal reservoirs . in the absence of interactions , the population of quasiparticles at a given energy interpolates linearly between the distribution functions in the contacts , leading , if @xmath3 to a double - step - shaped distribution function . in the opposite `` hot electron '' regime , in which the typical interaction time is much shorter than the diffusion time @xmath4 equilibrium is reached locally at each position along the wire : the energy distribution function @xmath5 is a fermi function ( see dotted curves in fig.@xmath6[figsetup ] ) .",
    "if heat is only carried out by electrons , the local temperature is @xmath7 where @xmath8is the lorenz number @xcite .",
    "our experiments focus on the intermediate regime , in which interactions lead to a significant redistribution of the energy among quasiparticles , but not to a complete thermalization .",
    "the distribution function is obtained from the differential conductance @xmath9 of a tunnel junction between the wire and superconducting electrodes relax , rowell . when the temperature of the superconductor lies well below the superconducting transition temperature , and if the density of states in the normal electrode wire is taken as energy independent on the probed energy range , the differential conductance of the junction is simply proportional to the convolution product of the density of states in the superconductor @xmath10 with @xmath11 the gap of the superconductor , and of the energy derivative of the distribution function in the wire , @xmath12@xmath13with @xmath14 the tunnel resistance of the junction .",
    "the samples were fabricated by deposition with an electron - gun , at several angles , through a pmma suspended mask patterned using e - beam lithography .",
    "the substrate was thermally oxidized silicon , as in our experiments on cu and ag .",
    "we fabricated on the same chip two au wires : wire # 1 , with length @xmath15 and a single probe junction placed at @xmath16 ; and wire # 2 , with length @xmath17 and two probe junctions , at @xmath18 and @xmath19    we first deposited a @xmath20-thick aluminum film , which was then oxidized .",
    "this layer defines the superconducting probe electrodes .",
    "the wires and the pads were obtained by the subsequent evaporation from a 99.99% purity gold target , at a pressure of @xmath21 , at @xmath22 . the thickness and width of the wires are @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xmath25 .",
    "the electrodes at the ends of the wires are @xmath26-thick pads , with an area of about @xmath27 . from the low temperature wire resistances @xmath28 and @xmath29 we deduce from einstein s relation , assuming rectangular cross - sections , the diffusion constant @xmath30 and the diffusion times @xmath31 and @xmath32 the samples were mounted in a copper box thermally anchored to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator .",
    "electrical connections were made through filtered coaxial lines @xcite .",
    "measurements proceed as follows . in a first step ,",
    "the voltage @xmath33 is set to zero . from the comparison of the measured differential conductance of the tunnel junctions with the calculated convolution product of the bcs density of states and of the derivative of a fermi function at the temperature of the mixing chamber",
    "( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) , we deduce the gap of the superconductor ( @xmath34 ) and the tunnel resistances @xcite ( @xmath35 ( wire # 1 ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( wire # 2 ) ) . in a second step ,",
    "the voltage @xmath33 is set to a dc value . from the differential conductance of the tunnel junctions",
    ", we deduce by numerical deconvolution the distribution functions in the wire at the position of the junctions , using eq .",
    "( 1 ) and the values of the gap and tunnel resistance determined in the first step .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ f(e ) ] the distribution functions measured with the three junctions at @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41  @xmath42 heatings .",
    "as expected from the difference in the diffusion times , the distribution functions are much more rounded in wire # 2 than in wire # 1 .",
    "the distribution function at the middle of wire # 2 is close to the hot electron prediction , shown with a dotted line in the central panel for @xmath43 however , the distribution functions measured on the same wire close to the left electrode ( right panel ) are clearly different from fermi functions : they display a strong slope near @xmath44 reminiscent of the fermi step at this energy in the closest pad ( a ) which was grounded .",
    "the larger the voltage @xmath45 the wider the interval of energy in which @xmath46 varies from 1 to 0 , as expected in both limiting regimes ( see fig .",
    "figsetup ) .",
    "in order to remove this dependence , we have replotted the same data in the bottom of fig .",
    "[ f(e ) ] , but with the reduced energy @xmath47 on the horizontal axis .",
    "remarkably , all scaled curves superimpose .",
    "this scaling property , which was also found in all the experiments on copper wires , is not generic : in experiments on silver wires , the slope of @xmath2 at @xmath48 was found to increase with @xmath33 @xcite@xmath49      the distribution function can be calculated by solving the stationary boltzmann equation in the diffusive regime @xcite : @xmath50where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the rates at which quasiparticles are scattered in and out of a state at energy @xmath53 by inelastic processes .",
    "the observation of the hot - electron regime in the middle of wire # 2 , with a temperature close to the expected one , indicates that the energy is mainly redistributed among the quasiparticles .",
    "in particular , phonon emission can be neglected . assuming that the dominant inelastic process is a two - quasiparticle interaction which is local on the scale of variations of the distribution function , @xmath54where the shorthand @xmath55 stands for @xmath56 the out - collision term @xmath57 has a similar form .",
    "the kernel function @xmath58 is proportional to the averaged squared interaction between two quasiparticles exchanging an energy @xmath59 we have neglected the possible dependence of @xmath60 on the energies of the initial and final states and on the position along the wire .",
    "the theory of electron - electron interactions in diffusive conductors in the @xmath61 regime @xcite predicts @xmath62 a regime which was observed in silver wires @xcite . in gold and copper wires , the scaling property implies , by a simple change of variables in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , that @xmath63 is a function of @xmath64 only @xcite .",
    "if futhermore @xmath58 does not depend on @xmath45 one obtains @xmath65 with @xmath66 a typical interaction rate .",
    "we nevertheless tried to fit our data at @xmath67 with @xmath68 , and obtained @xmath69 , which is three orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical prediction @xmath70 with @xmath71 the density of states in gold and @xmath72 the cross - section of the wire kamenev , relaxag .",
    "moreover , the shape of the distribution functions on wire # 2 is not properly reproduced and the calculated curve for wire # 1 at @xmath73 with the same parameter is significantly more rounded than the experimental data .",
    "figure [ fitsexp2 ] shows the best fit of the data with @xmath74 obtained with @xmath75 .     by construction , the scaling property of the data",
    "is exactly reproduced . whereas the shape of the distribution functions on wire # 2 is well accounted for , the experimental data on wire # 1 are more rounded than we calculate .",
    "the opposite discrepancy was observed in experiments on @xmath76  @xmath77long copper wires @xcite .",
    "we attribute the strong rounding in the distribution functions on wire # 1 to the large heating of the reservoirs associated with the low resistance of wire # 1 : at a given value of voltage @xmath78 the heat power @xmath79 is the highest in the less - resistive wires .",
    "the solution of the heat equation in the contacts , assumed to have the shape of an angular sector , with angle @xmath80 , and neglecting phonon emission , gives the reservoir temperature at the end of the wire @xcite : @xmath81 here , @xmath82 is the temperature of the quasiparticles at a large distance @xmath83 from the contact to the wire , and @xmath84 with @xmath85 the sheet resistance of the reservoir , estimated from the resistivity of the wires and the thickness ratio of the wires and of the reservoirs , @xmath86 a typical equilibration length between electrons and phonons @xcite , and @xmath87 the smallest radius for the radial approximation to be valid : @xmath88 in the experiment , the left contact ( labelled a in fig .",
    "[ dessin ] ) , opens with an angle @xmath89 whereas the two other contacts ( b and c in fig .  [ dessin ] ) have a smaller angle : @xmath90 we have fitted the distribution functions separately from @xmath91 to @xmath92 with the temperatures of the reservoirs as fit parameters .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ tempreservoirs ] .    at voltages below @xmath93",
    "the fit temperature is nearly constant and identical in both reservoirs : @xmath94 in reasonable agreement with the temperature @xmath95 indicated by the thermometer on the mixing chamber . at such low voltages ,",
    "scaling is not obeyed since temperature produces a significant rounding of the steps and @xmath96 varies with @xmath97 from the fit of the data on fig .",
    "[ tempreservoirs ] , we deduce @xmath98 for the left contact , and @xmath99 for the right contact .",
    "theory gives @xmath100 in excellent agreement with the ratio found from the fits .",
    "our estimated values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 are about a factor of 2 larger than those obtained from fig .",
    "[ tempreservoirs ] , possibly because the sheet resistance of the reservoirs is less than our estimate based on the electronic mean free path in the wire . at voltages larger than @xmath103 ,",
    "the temperature of the reservoirs is proportional to @xmath45 leading to a scaling in the rounding of the steps .",
    "in contrast , we want to stress that the slope of the distribution function near @xmath104 can not be explained by heating alone .",
    "the fits of the distribution functions in this regime , taking into account both @xmath105 ( with @xmath106 ) and heating is shown on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ tempreservoirs ] .",
    "a consequence of reservoir heating is that the distribution functions are rounded at the scale of @xmath107 and the sharp features that were observed on copper samples can not not be resolved @xcite .",
    "the distribution functions can also be well accounted for by a model in which quasiparticles are in local equilibrium with two - level systems distributed uniformly along the wire .",
    "the relevance of tls on phase relaxation has recently been suggested by several authors imry , zawa , kroha .",
    "agreement is found if one assumes , in a simple model ( described in @xcite ) , that the quasiparticles are weakly coupled to the tls with a density inversely proportional to the spacing @xmath108 between the two levels .",
    "such a density is obtained if the two - level systems are the two lowest energy levels in symmetric double - well potentials , and if the distribution of the barrier heights is uniform . in glasses the distribution of potential well asymmetries",
    "is usually taken as white  glasses , but one might argue that in metals , symmetric double - wells could result from crystalline symmetries   @xcite .",
    "we note that a similar assumption is made in calculations based on a strong coupling to tls kroha .",
    "complementary information on interactions was obtained from resistance measurements . we have fabricated long gold wires in the same deposition machine as for the energy relaxation experiment .",
    "to enhance adhesion of the au film on the substrate , we used two different methods . for a first sample ( au1 )   @xcite , we evaporated first @xmath109 of aluminum , and oxidized it . on a second sample ( au2 ) ,",
    "the surface of the sample was ion - milled just before gold deposition .",
    "a more complete set of data was taken on sample au2 , and we report only here the results on this sample .",
    "its length , width and thickness are @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively .",
    "the low temperature resistance was @xmath113 assuming einstein s relation and a rectangular cross - section , we deduce the diffusion constant @xmath114  @xmath115rrrin another fabrication run conducted at michigan state university , we have joule evaporated another sample , called aumsu , with very pure gold ( 99.9999% , _ i.e. _ @xmath116 of impurities ) , with @xmath117 @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath114  @xmath115 .",
    "all the samples were measured in the same top - loading dilution refrigerator .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ rvst ] the temperature dependence of the resistance for samples au2 and aumsu .",
    "the contribution of weak localization for au2 , smaller than @xmath120 ( see below ) , can be neglected . for aumsu",
    ", this contribution , up to 3@xmath121 in @xmath122 has a well understood temperature dependence ( see below ) , and was substracted .",
    "the contribution of electron - electron interactions to the resistivity , @xmath123 waves , with @xmath124 and @xmath125 plotted as dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ rvst ] , accounts well for the data of aumsu @xcite , where the fit parameter @xmath126 is very close to the calculated value @xmath127 in contrast , the variations observed in au2 are stronger and have a different temperature dependence .",
    "a good fit of the data can be obtained with : @xmath128 with @xmath129 the logarithmic term is characteristic of the kondo effect @xcite , and it was in particular studied in great detail in dilute alloys of fe in au giordano , bergmann , chandrasekhar , mwkondo , where @xmath130 was found to be proportional to the fe concentration and dependent on the cross section of the wire as well as on disorder .",
    "assuming that the logarithmic dependence of the resistance of au2 is due to fe impurities , we get , by comparison with a sample with similar width , thickness and diffusion constant ( aufe2 in mwkondo ) , an impurity concentration @xmath131 which is compatible with the purity of the gold source used for evaporation ( 99.99% , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath132 of impurities ) @xcite .",
    "we present in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ rvsb ] the magnetoresistance of au2 and aumsu .   around zero magnetic field , the resistance presents a dip , as expected from weak antilocalisation aa .",
    "a large - scale negative magnetoresistance is found on au2 , which is similar to measurements performed on dilute alloys of fe in au giordano , mwkondo .",
    "it can be attributed to the freezing of the magnetic moment of the impurities with the magnetic field @xcite . in order to extract the phase coherence time from the magnetoresistance of au2 , we subtracted out the large scale magnetoresistance , which was , at each temperature , fitted with @xmath133 the remaining magnetoresistance was then fitted with the predictions of the weak localization theory @xcite . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ rvsb ] , we show the phase coherence time @xmath134 of samples au1 , au2 and aumsu as a function of temperature . upon cooling ,",
    "the phase coherence time of au1 and au2 remains unchanged from @xmath0 to @xmath135 : @xmath136 then it increases roughly as @xmath137 .",
    "a simple interpretation of the very low value of @xmath138 and of the desaturation below @xmath1 is found by comparing with similar measurements performed on gold wires in which a small amount of iron was purposely introduced @xcite . the same behavior of @xmath139 was found in these experiments , and it was interpreted as an effect of spin - flip scattering by the impurities , the rate of which presents a maximum at the kondo temperature of fe in au ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "the value @xmath141 of @xmath134 near the kondo temperature was found to be roughly given by @xmath142 with the concentration of impurities @xmath143 expressed in ppm ( parts per million ) mw , mwkondo . in this interpretation",
    ", @xmath144 is obtained for @xmath145 this provides us with another estimation of @xmath143 which is of the same order of magnitude as what we deduced from the resistance vs. temperature measurements .",
    "sample aumsu does not show any magnetoresistance at large scale , and the phase coherence time presents no saturation down to @xmath146 ( see fig .",
    "rvsb ) . a good fit of the data could be obtained with the theoretical dependence @xcite @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath149 the theoretical value from the theory of electron - electron interactions is @xmath150 @xcite@xmath49    to allow for a comparison with the results of mohanty _ et al .",
    "_ , we have also plotted on the same figure the phase coherence time of samples au-3 and au-6 in @xcite , which have similar size and diffusion constants as aumsu ( au-3 : @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153  @xmath115 ; au-6 : @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath114  @xmath115 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that our data do not display the saturation found in @xcite .",
    "we had already found no saturation in measurements on silver wires @xcite , which were made from very pure ( 99.9999% ) ag .",
    "we suspect that energy exchanges in samples fabricated with very pure au would be consistent with the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , as in very pure ag @xcite , but this experiment remains to be performed .",
    "it is noteworthy that the low - temperature saturation of @xmath156 reported in cu wires @xcite was identically found in other samples obtained from 99.9999% cu , supporting the hypothesis that surface oxide could play a major role in cu haesendonck .",
    "the data presented in section 2 provide strong evidence that some of the gold wires we have studied contain several tens of ppm of iron .",
    "the question arises as to whether the energy exchange measurements can also be explained by the presence of these magnetic impurities .",
    "kaminski and glazman glazman recently pointed out that @xmath157 is obtained in second order perturbation theory from the interaction of two quasiparticles with a magnetic impurity .",
    "the effective matrix element @xmath158 of the second order process is proportional to @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the coupling parameter between the quasiparticles and the magnetic impurity and @xmath161 is the energy difference between the intermediate ( virtual ) state and the initial state . in the intermediate state ,",
    "one quasiparticle is promoted to an energy state higher by @xmath108 than the initial state , whereas the magnetic impurity has been reversed .",
    "one thus obtains @xmath162 which has the energy dependence observed in the experiment , but the bare coupling parameter @xmath163 is too small@xmath49 if one assumes that we have fe impurities in au , @xmath164 is of the order of the energies probed in the energy exchange experiment , and the coupling constant is expected to be renormalised by the kondo effect .",
    "this effect has been treated in @xcite , and the proposed expression @xmath165 has now the right order of magnitude but too strong a @xmath33-dependence .",
