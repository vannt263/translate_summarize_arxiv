    "it is well - known that the magnetic susceptibility of a spin model near its critical temperature can be parametrized as @xmath0 in this expression , the exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 are universal and can be obtained from the calculation of the eigenvalues of the linearized renormalization group ( rg ) transformation . on the other hand , the critical amplitudes @xmath3 are functions of the microscopic details of the theory .",
    "one can find universal relations @xcite among these amplitudes and the ones associated with other thermodynamic quantities , however these relations do not fix completely the amplitudes . in the end , if we want a quantitative estimate of a particular amplitude , we need to perform a calculation which requires a knowledge of many details of the rg flows .",
    "such a calculation is in general a difficult , nonlinear , multivariable problem . in this article",
    "we propose a general strategy based on the construction of nonlinear scaling fields associated with _",
    "several _ fixed points , to calculate the critical amplitudes , and we demonstrate its feasibility in the case of dyson s hierarchical model .    a common strategy in problems involving nonlinear flows near a singular point , is to construct a new system of coordinates for which the governing equations become linear .",
    "it seems intuitively clear that if the original problem is sufficiently nontrivial , normal form methods can only work in some limited way , locally , because the flows of the nonlinear problem have global properties which do not match those of the linear flows . a well - known argument for the inadequacy of such procedure ( which extends beyond the special case of an expansion near a singular point )",
    "was provided by poincar @xcite in the context of perturbed integrable hamiltonians .",
    "he discovered that even though it is possible to write a formal perturbative series for the action - angle variables , some coefficients have `` small denominators '' , and generically , the series are ill - defined . however , under some restrictions ( formulated according to some appropriate version of the k. a. m. theorem @xcite ) , perturbation theory can still provide interesting information .",
    "almost thirty years ago , wegner@xcite , introduced quantities that transformed multiplicatively under a rg transformation .",
    "he called them `` scaling fields '' and we will use his terminology in the following . sometimes , one also uses the terminology `` nonlinear scaling field '' to distinguish them from the linear ones ( see section [ sec:3steps ] for details ) . in the following , `` scaling fields '' mean the nonlinear ones and we will use the terminology `` linear scaling fields '' when necessary .",
    "these fields play a central role in the presentation of the basic ideas of the rg .",
    "they appear in almost any review on the subject ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as in the case of hamiltonian dynamics",
    ", there exists a formal series expansion for the scaling variables ( see eq .",
    "( 4.9 ) in ref .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the functions defined with this procedure are analytic , at least within a certain neighborhood of the fixed point .",
    "however , for most non - trivial models , it is very difficult to prove this assumption .",
    "in particular , it is difficult to address the question of small denominators because it requires an accurate calculation of the eigenvalues of the linearized rg transformation .",
    "if the small denominator problem can be controlled and if some _ local _ expansion is well - defined , there remain several important _ global _ issues .",
    "what is the domain of convergence of this expansion ?",
    "how does the accuracy of an expansion with a finite number of terms evolve when we move away from the fixed point ?",
    "can different expansions have overlapping domain of convergence ? these important _ global _ issues are rarely discussed because of practical limitations : in crossover regions , we need large order expansions in many variables . unfortunately , this problem has to be faced if we want to calculate all the critical amplitudes . in this article",
    ", we propose a general strategy to calculate directly the critical amplitudes .",
    "this strategy has been developed using dyson s hierarchical model , where large order expansions in many variables are practically feasible .",
    "all the numerical calculations presented hereafter were done with this model ( or a simplified version of it ) .",
    "the general point of view that we want to advocate here is that one should combine different sets of scaling fields .",
    "even though the scaling fields are almost always constructed in the vicinity of wilson s fixed point , they can in principle be constructed near any other fixed point . if one can find some overlap among the domains of convergence of these expansions it is possible to reconstruct the flows , given their initial values .",
    "in other words , we would like to develop a new analytical approach to complement the existing methods used to deal with the crossover between fixed points , namely , the monte carlo method @xcite , a combination of field - theoretical methods and mean field calculations @xcite or the study of the entropy associated with the rg flows @xcite .    in the following , we concentrate on the study of the rg flows in the symmetric phase of spin models having a nontrivial unstable fixed point .",
    "our goal is to calculate the critical amplitudes by constructing the scaling fields near the three relevant fixed points : the gaussian fixed point ( if relevant ) , the unstable fixed point ( sometimes called the ir fixed point or wilson s fixed point ) , and the high - temperature ( ht ) fixed point .",
    "the idea is represented schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : pic ] .    we propose to follow three specific steps to achieve this goal .",
    "these steps correspond to a construction in backward order , starting with the flows near the ht fixed point and ending with the initial conditions .",
    "first , we express the thermodynamic quantities in terms of the scaling fields of the ht fixed point .",
    "second , we use the scaling fields of the unstable ir fixed point , to write the thermodynamic quantities as a main singularity times a rg invariant quantity constructed out the two scaling fields .",
    "third , we calculate the initial values of the scaling fields associated with the unstable fixed point in terms of the basic parameters appearing the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "these three steps are explained in more detail in section [ sec:3steps ] .",
    "this section is essential to understand the general ideas and the notations used later .",
    "it should be noted that the first two steps are independent of the initial conditions and are in some sense universal . on the other hand ,",
    "the third step provides the initial data as a function of the basic parameters such as the temperature or the `` bare parameters '' of landau - ginzburg models .",
    "consequently , the method used to implement the third step depends on the initial measure considered .",
    "for instance , if we start with an initial measure near the gaussian fixed point , perturbative field theoretical methods ( feynman diagrams ) will be used .",
    "each of these three steps can in principle be implemented for spin models with nearest neighbor interactions in three dimensions , by using available expansions to describe the flows in each region . however , in order to discuss the behavior of the expansions in the crossover region , we need large order expansions . despite the existence of increasingly sophisticated methods used for various expansions in nearest neighbor models ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is still a major time investment to perform these expansions . in order to test the feasibility of the procedure , we have considered approximations for which large order expansions ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) can be reached more easily .",
    "namely , we have used hierarchical approximations where only the local part of the measure is renormalized under a rg transformation .",
    "well - known examples are the `` approximate recursion formula '' @xcite or dyson s hierarchical model ( hm)@xcite . despite this approximation , the nonlinear aspects of the problem are still nontrivial . to fix the ideas , the calculations that we have performed",
    "required the determination of several thousands of coefficients in various expansions .",
    "the relevant facts about the hm and its rg transformation are reviewed in section [ sec : hm ] . before embarking in a multivariable calculation ,",
    "we have first considered a simplified version involving only one variable@xcite where the small denominator problem is obviously absent . this model discussed in section [ sec : tm ] , is simply a quadratic map with two fixed points , one stable and one unstable .",
    "series expansions for the scaling fields of this simplified model , and their inverse , can easily be constructed . treating these numerical series with well - known estimators @xcite",
    ", we obtain radii of convergence and exponents in very good agreement with what we can infer by using general arguments .",
    "these numerical results will be used as references when a similar analysis is conducted later for the hm . the most important result of section [ sec : tm ] is illustrated fig .",
    "[ fig : tmoverlap ] which shows that the expansions of the scaling fields scale accurately in overlapping regions .",
    "the rest of the article is devoted to the hm with one spin component per site ( as in the ising model ) .",
    "for this model , the existence of a non - trivial unstable fixed point has been proven rigorously @xcite .",
    "significant results have been obtained regarding the _ local _ existence of scaling fields for the rg map near the unstable fixed point by collet and eckmann @xcite and koch and wittwer @xcite .",
    "in addition , ref .",
    "@xcite contains a mathematical justification of the polynomial approximations that we have used to perform large order ht expansions @xcite or direct numerical calculations @xcite . in the following",
    ", the parameter playing the role of the dimensionality ( see section [ sec : hm ] ) will be tuned in such way that a gaussian massless field scales exactly as in three dimensions . in other words",
    ", we will work at an intermediate value between the upper and lower critical dimensions and the @xmath4-expansion is not obviously useful .",
    "for this particular choice of the dimensionality parameter , the numerical value of the unstable fixed point is known with great precision in a specific system of coordinates @xcite and the question of small denominators studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    using these results",
    "we first provide an explicit construction of the two sets of scaling fields and show that the first two steps can be implemented .",
    "we found simple linear relations between the derivatives of the free energy and the ht scaling fields .",
    "the rg invariants discussed above can be calculated accurately ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rginv ] ) because the scaling fields associated with the two fixed points scale accurately in overlapping regions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hmoverlap ] .",
    "the third step was performed in the case of an initial ising measure where the temperature is the only free parameter .",
    "putting everything together , we can calculate the leading and subleading amplitude of the susceptibility and have very good agreement with previous numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed startegy . in the conclusions ,",
    "we discuss our plans to extend this method for perturbative initial conditions and for nearest neighbor models .",
    "a few words of caution .",
    "we want to make clear that the main result presented in this article is a calculation of the leading and subleading critical amplitudes of the magnetic susceptibility of the hierarchical model .",
    "this calculation shows that the strategy discussed in the coming section ii can be implemented successfully for this particular model .",
    "the fact that part of the introduction and section ii are written for a general spin model should not be interpreted as the statement that it is straightforward to implement the strategy for other models than the hierarchical model .",
    "the reader whose main interest is the hierarchical model may read section ii as a general description of what is done in the rest of the paper . on the other hand ,",
    "the reader interested in using the general strategy for other models , should be aware that we do not provide a general procedure for constructing the unstable fixed point and its scaling fields .",
    "in addition , the fact that we found overlapping domain of convergence in the particular computation presented here is an encouraging result but it does not guarantee that a similar overlap will be found for other models .",
    "in this section , we consider a scalar model on a @xmath5-dimensional lattice with a lattice spacing @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 and that the free energy density @xmath8 is finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we discuss the estimation of the critical amplitudes in the ht phase for @xmath9 , the @xmath10-th derivative of @xmath11 with respect to an external magnetic field . for definiteness , we generalize the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : param ] ) to @xmath12 we assume the existence of a discrete rg transformation @xmath13 , which can be performed in the following way .",
    "we first integrate the fields in blocks of side @xmath14 while keeping the sum of the fields in the block constant .",
    "we then rescale the sums of the fields by a factor @xmath15 . for the hm , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that this rg transformation has one non - trivial unstable fixed point and an attractive ht fixed point .",
    "we first introduce general notations for the scaling fields and then discuss the three steps .",
    "a preliminary requisite is the construction of the two sets of scaling fields .",
    "we construct the scaling fields near the unstable fixed point , denoted @xmath18 , in terms of the coordinates @xmath19 in the directions of the eigenvectors of the linearized rg map at that fixed point .",
    "the boldface notations mean that the quantity is a vector . in the following",
    "we will consider finite dimensional approximations for such vectors .",
    "for small values of @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 .",
    "one could call the @xmath19 , the `` linear scaling fields '' or the `` real fields '' @xcite if they have a simple physical interpretation .",
    "if we denote the rg transformation in the @xmath19 coordinates as @xmath22 , and @xmath23 as the eigenvalue in the @xmath24-th direction , we have by definition of the scaling fields @xmath25 in the following , we assume that the spectrum is real , positive , non - degenerate and that only @xmath26 .    similarly , the ht scaling fields denoted @xmath27 , can be constructed as expansions in the coordinates @xmath28 in the directions of the eigenvectors of the linearized rg map at the ht fixed point . with notation analog to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaw ] ) , we have @xmath29 the @xmath19 s can be expressed in terms of the @xmath28 s by a shift followed by a linear transformation . in the following @xmath30 or @xmath31",
    "will denote the value of the @xmath10-th scaling field after @xmath32 iterations , and similar notations will be used for the ht variables .",
    "the first step consists in expressing the @xmath9 in terms of the scaling fields of the ht fixed point @xmath33 . in the vicinity of the ht fixed point ,",
    "the effective lattice spacing becomes larger than the physical correlation lengths .",
    "this fixed point is attractive and as the number of iterations @xmath32 becomes large , one can treat the blocks as almost isolated systems with a large volume @xmath34 . in the following we call @xmath35 the average value of the @xmath10-th power of the total spin in this volume minus its disconnected parts , divided by the volume . assuming that @xmath36 is finite for @xmath37 , we conclude that the subtracted average value of the @xmath10-th power of the _ rescaled _ sum of all the spins scales like @xmath38 for @xmath32 large and should be expressible as products of the @xmath33 with product of eigenvalues @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , in explicit calculations for the hm model , we found that simple linear relations hold , namely , when @xmath32 becomes large @xmath40 and consequently , @xmath41 with @xmath42 denoting the initial values and @xmath43 a constant depending on the choice the scales of the coordinates @xmath28 and easily calculable .",
    "this is discussed explicitly in subsection [ subsec : hmstep1 ] for the hm . for the simplicity of the exposition",

    "nevertheless it is straightforward to generalize the construction for the case of products of ht scaling fields .",
    "the expansion of @xmath44 is expected to converge for @xmath42 small enough , however it might not be very useful or even meaningful near the unstable fixed point or the gaussian fixed point .",
    "if @xmath45denotes the leading critical exponent for @xmath46 , it follows from arguments based on the linear rg transformation that @xmath47 =  -  ln@xmath48/ln@xmath49 .",
    "consequently , @xmath50 is rg - invariant .",
    "we can then factor out the susceptibility into a singular part and a rg invariant part : @xmath51 \\ .",

    "one of the main results presented in this article are numerical evidences that this procedure actually works .",
    "in other words , that there exists an overlap between the domains where approximate expansions of the scaling fields scale as they should .",
    "the scaling properties of expansions are related to convergence issues which need to be discussed in the complexification of the construction . if an eigenvalue appearing in the defining equation for the scaling fields eqs .",
    "( [ eq : scaw ] ) and ( [ eq : scat ] ) , is such that @xmath53 , it is clear that the only values that can be taken by @xmath54 at a fixed point are 0 and @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , a detailed analysis of the fixed points for the complexification of the rg transformation can put restrictions on the domain of convergence of the scaling fields .",
    "later , the inverse functions @xmath56 or @xmath57 will also be used .",
    "their radius of convergence can be restricted by the study of the extrema of the original function . in the case of the one dimensional model of section",
    "[ sec : tm ] , such a study can be conducted easily and confirms the results of the numerical analysis .    near criticality , for the values of @xmath32 in the crossover discussed above , the values of the scaling fields associated with the irrelevant directions are usually very small ( unless very large initial values have been chosen ) and can be treated perturbatively . in first approximation",

    "@xcite following a procedure developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to prove feigenbaum conjectures .",
    "it should also be noted that since the rg considered here is discrete ( it is constructed by iterating @xmath13 an integer number of times ) , rg - invariant does not mean independent of @xmath42 .",
    "there is room for log - periodic corrections , which have been first noticed by wilson @xcite , discussed in general in ref .",
    "@xcite and observed in the ht expansion of the hm in refs .",
    "these corrections are studied for the simplified model in section [ sec : tm ] . in our numerical study of the hm of section [ sec : hm ] , these corrections are too small to be resolved and will be ignored .      in the previous step , we traded a difficult problem ( the estimation of the initial values of @xmath58 ) for two simpler problems : the estimation of the rg invariant and the estimation of the initial values of @xmath59 . up to now , we have treated these initial values as free variables and constructed functions of these variables which depended only on the rg transformation .",
    "we now need to incorporate the information related to the actual initial values .",

    "a more complete construction of the initial values in terms of the `` bare parameters '' used in field theoretical perturbative calculations ( with flows starting near the gaussian fixed point ) is in progress @xcite but will not be discussed here .",
    "in this section , we review the basic facts about the rg transformation of the hm to be used in the rest of the paper and discuss various way to obtain finite dimensional truncations . for more detail , the reader may consult ref .",
    "@xcite and other papers quoted in the introduction .",

    "the explicit form for @xmath92 in terms of @xmath93 reads @xmath94 where @xmath95    to study the susceptibility not too far from the ht fixed point , we can expand @xmath88 in terms of @xmath70 .",

    "fig : rginv ] . using the flattest part of the plateau to estimate the constant we obtain @xmath350 and @xmath351 .",
    "note that these two numbers are dependent of the choice of the scales for the scaling fields , but independent of the initial conditions .",
    "consequently , if everybody agreed on the scales , these quantities could be called universal .",
    "there remains to estimate the initial values of the @xmath265 and @xmath280 .",
    "this step will done numerically from empirical values of @xmath254 .",
    "first , we obtain a rough estimate of @xmath352 from @xmath353 at values of @xmath32 where the linear approximation is good .",

    "( [ eq : pertexp ] ) for @xmath354 , and inverting to get @xmath273 as a function of @xmath272 . dividing by @xmath355",
    "we get an estimated value of @xmath356 with a plateau of about 10 iterations where the value is stabilized with 6 digits . repeating for various temperatures we were able to determine the leading coefficient in eq .",

    "( [ eq : pertexp ] ) but for @xmath358 , together with our previous estimates of @xmath359 , we obtain @xmath360 .",
    "subleading coefficients are difficult to resolve because @xmath361 and the nonlinear contributions in @xmath362 are of the same order as the analytical corrections .",
    "this conclude our approximate treatment of step 3 . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : suspar ] ) and ( [ eq : rginv ] ) we obtain the usual parametrization of the susceptibility of eq .",
    "( [ eq : param ] ) with @xmath363 and @xmath364 in very good agreement with a fully numerical determination of these amplitudes @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have shown with two examples that the 3 steps advocated in section [ sec:3steps ] lead to an accurate determination of the leading and subleading critical amplitudes .",
    "we provided numerical evidence that the formal expansions of the scaling fields associated with the ht and unstable fixed point have reasonable convergence properties and scale properly in overlapping domains .",
    "the determination of the initial values of the scaling fields associated with the unstable fixed point ( third step ) have been obtained numerically in the case of an initial ising measure . putting everything together",
    ", we were able to confirm numerical results obtained earlier .",
    "analytical methods are now being used @xcite to consider initial measures of the landau - ginzburg type in the vicinity of the gaussian fixed point . for such initial measures",
    ", we can use perturbation theory in the quartic ( or higher orders ) coupling constant to construct the scaling fields associated with the gaussian fixed point .",
    "interestingly , one could use some of the methods developed here to interpolate between the gaussian fixed point and the unstable fixed point .",
    "the completion of this task will allow us to give analytical expressions for the renormalized quantities in terms of the bare ones , which is the notoriously difficult problem that has to be faced by a field theorist .",
    "we are planning to extend the calculations performed here , to higher order derivatives of the free energy with a non - zero magnetic field and check explicitly amplitudes relations appearing in the literature @xcite .",
    "another interesting question that could be addressed within this context is the crossover from classical to critical behavior @xcite .",
    "the completion of these projects will provide a detailed comparison between general rg expectations and their practical realization for the hm .",
    "the hierarchical approximation used in this article has allowed us to calculate large order expansions for the scaling fields .",
    "the fact that the general ideas advocated have worked properly means that one should now attempt to apply them to nearest neighbor models where similar calculations would be more time consuming .",
    "the examples we have in mind are spin models in three dimensions and asymptotically free theory such as the @xmath365 spin models in two dimensions or lattice gauge theory in four dimensions . in all cases",
    ", there exists some advanced technology for the weak and strong coupling expansions but the question of the interpolation has only been studied with the monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "we expect that some of the simple features found in the study of the ht fixed point of the hm will generalize to nearest neighbor models .",
    "first , the fact that the ht scaling fields are linearly related to the successive derivatives of the free energy .",
    "second , the fact that the restriction to a finite number of eigenvectors of the linearized rg transformation near the ht fixed point can be used to obtain improved ht expansions such as the polynomial truncation used above .",
    "however , the most difficult task remains a construction of the unstable fixed point and the rg flows in its vicinity , with a control comparable to the case the hierarchical model .",
