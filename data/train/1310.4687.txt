    "superradiance is a well - known cooperative phenomenon that was first predicted in theory by dicke in 1954  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing conclusion is that when @xmath0 identical atoms in the limit of a small dimension are uniformly excited by a single photon , the decay rate of the system is @xmath0 times that of the isolated atom .",
    "the cooperative effect is due to the exchange of real and virtual photons between atoms by the interaction field , and it is obvious that the distances between atoms play a key role in the cooperative spontaneous emission .",
    "the simplest theoretical model is the two - atom system  @xcite , where the dependence of collective decay rate and lamb shift on the distance is clearly demonstrated .",
    "for the @xmath0-atom system , several models , such as atomic clouds with spherical , cubic and slab - shaped geometry , or atoms arranged as a straight line , have been studied with different approaches  @xcite .",
    "the manipulations of cooperative spontaneous emission can realize many interesting behaviors and potential applications  @xcite .",
    "summary review on the cooperative spontaneous emission under certain approximations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , cooperative spontaneous emission received renewed interest when the emission from an @xmath0-atom system excited by a single photon was considered  @xcite . with the development of experimental technology ,",
    "it becomes possible to detect the single - photon superradiance  @xcite , which might yield new tools for storing quantum information and deepening our understanding on the physics of virtual processes  @xcite .",
    "the cooperative decay was observed more than 40 years ago  @xcite , but the direct experimental observation of the cooperative lamb shift has been achieved just recently  @xcite .",
    "this breakthrough is stimulating the study on the effect of the virtual processes in the cooperative spontaneous emission .",
    "for a special initial state , i.e. the timed dicke state , a directed emission with large atomic samples is predicted  @xcite .",
    "the dynamic problem involving the counter - rotating terms for a single excitation in a large atomic sample was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , under several approximations , the author obtained the analytic conclusions indicating that the evolution of the timed dicke state obeys the simple exponential decay .    in most of the previous papers on the cooperative spontaneous emission ,",
    "the details of atomic positions are ignored and an average interatomic distance  @xcite or the continuum approximation  @xcite ( sums over atoms replaced by integrals , actually , which is equivalent to the distance average ) is taken .",
    "furthermore , in most of recent papers about single - excitation cooperative spontaneous emission , the scalar photon theory which ignores the polarization and vector character of the field has been applied  @xcite . in our previous works",
    "@xcite , we studied the same problem in optical vector theory but did not reckon in the electrostatic dipole - dipole interaction which dominates when the distance between atoms is much smaller than the wavelength . in another paper  @xcite , we have investigated the influence of the atomic distribution on the cooperative spontaneous emission for a simple model of three atoms with the electrostatic dipole - dipole interaction in optical vector theory .",
    "we found that the atomic distribution significantly influences the cooperative effects of the system , which leads us to suspect the universal applicability of the continuum approximation for multi - atom systems .    in this paper , we extend the study about the influence of the atomic distribution on the cooperative spontaneous emission from the three - atom system  @xcite to the @xmath0-atom one . the purpose of this paper is to illustrate that the spontaneous emission in random atomic distribution is very different from that in uniform distribution and the conclusions under the continuum approximation may be questionable for real experiments .",
    "the strong superradiance which approaches to the dicke limit is hard to obtain in real experimental conditions where atoms are always distributed randomly . on the other hand , with the development of semiconductor quantum dots , the highly ordered arrays can be achieved in this artificial system  @xcite and its superradiance has been observed in experiment  @xcite . in the controllable artificial system",
    ", the cooperative effects can be studied in a regime which was difficult to achieve with real atoms  @xcite , and our results may be valuable to its experimental research .",

    "we select two different geometry cases , a square and a cube . for each case , we made the atomic distribution from totally random to slight disturbance and finally , completely regular . to produce the random or slightly disturbed positions of atoms , we first fix atoms regularly in their own positions [ see figs .",

    "[ fig1](a2 ) and  [ fig2](a2 ) , there is only one dot appearing with large @xmath102 and with its decay rate close to the superradiant limit @xmath104 , while the dots belonging to all other modes have negligible contribution for the initial dicke state .",
    "this means , the dicke state is a approximate radiative eigenstate with the large decay rate close to superradiant limit @xmath105 for the small atomic sample under the regular distribution .",

    ", we can see the emission of small atomic sample for the initial dicke state is superradiant whatever the distribution is .",
    "but , when the atoms are distributed regularly ( see the red dashed dotted line ) , the decay of the system will be much faster than that in the case of random atomic distribution ( see the blue dashed line and the green dotted line ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] .    here",
    "we try to give a physical interpretation of the above numerical results .",
    "the cooperative effect of spontaneous emission is influenced by the dipole - dipole interaction between atoms which has the @xmath91 behavior in the small atomic distance .",
    "if the atoms are distributed randomly , some part of them which are close to each other may converge together as a small subsystem .",
    "so the atomic ensemble is split up into multiple subsystems whose weak cooperative effects are restricted in their own interior . however , when the atoms are distributed uniformly , the photons can be uniformly exchanged among them and as a whole they can display the strong collective spontaneous emission . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the electrostatic dipole - dipole interaction is neglected unreasonably , then the interactions between atoms are less sensitive to the distances and the strong superradiance is still obtained under the random distribution .",
    "note that the effect of regular atomic distribution is universal for different geometries ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] ) , therefore , we only choose the cubic geometry in the below analysis .      for large multi - atom samples ,",

    "[ fig4](b2 ) and  [ fig4](b3 ) .",
    "instead , for regular large samples , the dicke state largely projects to a few eigenstates with one of them holding nearly @xmath111 probability , and the timed dicke state also mostly projects to a few eigenstates whose corresponding @xmath102 are biggish and similar , see figs .",
    "[ fig4](a2 ) and  [ fig4](a3 ) , respectively .",

    "[ fig5 ] , wherein the solid lines mean the decay of a single - atom for comparison .    from fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) we can see that the dicke state is surely a subradiant state and its decay is slower than single - atom one whatever the atomic distribution is .",
    "this result is similar to that in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the dicke state is not a good trapped state and its excitation will be slowly emitted due to the virtual processes .",
    "however , if the atoms are distributed regularly , the decay of the excitation will be slower than that in the case of general random distribution obviously .",
    "of course , it is not realistic to control the atoms in regular distribution for the sample of low - pressure gas in most experiments .",
    "however , the semi - conduct quantum dot is the burgeoning and hopeful system to control the distribution and compass the purpose of storing the photon by subradiance with the dicke state in large sample . here ,",

    "[ fig4](a3 ) first , where there are four eigenstates that dominate the evolution of the timed dicke state .",
    "it clearly demonstrates that the timed dicke state is not an approximate eigenstate for large atomic sample .",

    "this result is coincident with the conclusion in refs .",
    "@xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , we can see the approximately exponentially decaying behavior indeed .",
    "in addition , the difference of the evolved upper - state populations between the regular and random distributions for the timed dicke state is small , and the decays under the two distributions are both superradiant .",
    "in our previous works  @xcite , we studied the total spectrum of cooperative spontaneous emission which is the average of the spectra detected in each direction . here",

    "meanwhile , as the detuning @xmath120 is far less than the resonant frequency @xmath121 , we can replace @xmath122 by @xmath123 in the exponential term .",
    "based on these approximations , we have @xmath124 .",
    "next , we select the direction of the atomic dipole moment @xmath125 in the @xmath126 direction , and assume the wave vector of the incident light which prepares the timed dicke state along the @xmath127 direction . the position of the detector in the coordinate system is shown in fig .",
