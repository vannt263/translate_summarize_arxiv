    "the pion as the simplest particle with only two valence quarks has been the subject of many studies .",
    "global features of the pions - their charge and spin - are easily incorporated in model calculations .",
    "the form factor , which directly reflects the internal structure of this elementary particle , is clearly an important challenge .",
    "many earlier calculations are based on _ ad hoc _ models that model qcd or sum over selected subsets of feynman diagrams",
    ". however , the most reliable approach , in particular when addressing non - perturbative features as the electromagnetic form factor at intermediate momentum transfers , is the use of lattice qcd .",
    "the first lattice results were obtained by martinelli and sachrajda @xcite , which was followed by a more detailed study by draper _",
    "@xcite , who showed that the form factor obtained through lattice qcd with the wilson action could be described by a simple monopole form as suggested by vector meson dominance @xcite .",
    "below , we extend these early studies in two ways .",
    "we use an improved lattice action and an @xmath1 improved electromagnetic current operator .",
    "furthermore , we also extend the calculations to lower pion masses than achieved before .",
    "several features of the internal structure of the pion have been obtained previously @xcite by calculating the bethe - salpeter wave function , which can be used to estimate the relative separation of the quark - antiquark pair in the pion .",
    "we also use this approach and compare its predictions to the results of our direct calculation of the pion form factor .",
    "in comparison to earlier lattice calculations of pion properties , the major difference of our approach is the systematic reduction of the discretisation error in the calculation of the matrix elements .",
    "we use the non - perturbatively @xmath2 improved @xcite clover action @xcite and the corresponding @xmath2 improved current @xcite .    using this action",
    ", we proceed analogous to @xcite and calculate the two- and three - point correlation functions for the pion . projecting onto definite pion three - momentum ,",
    "the two - point function is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the operator projecting on a state with the pion quantum numbers .",
    "below , we will consider a @xmath5 meson , consisting of a @xmath6 and @xmath7 quark .",
    "neglecting all spin , colour and flavour indices , this operator is given by @xmath8    in the three point function , which yields the desired form factor , we project onto specific initial and final pion three momenta , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 this function involves the electromagnetic current operator @xmath12 ; since here we use only the component @xmath13 , we do not include a @xmath14-index in the definition of the three point function .",
    "it is well known that the local current , @xmath15 is not conserved on the lattice .",
    "the conserved noether current that belongs to our action , @xmath16 is identical to the conserved current for the wilson action and still contains corrections of @xmath1 at @xmath17 ; we use @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the four momentum transfer to the pion .",
    "the conserved and improved vector current @xmath20 is of the form @xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22 the bare - quark mass is obtained from : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the kappa value in the chiral limit and @xmath25 the lattice spacing . for our simulation",
    "we use @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the constants in @xmath27 are determined such that the matrix element of the current operator receives no correction to @xmath1 .",
    "our calculations were carried out in the quenched approximation on an @xmath28 lattice and based on a set of @xmath29 configurations for the link variables at @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "after an initial thermalisation of 2500 sweeps , we obtained configurations at intervals of 500 sweeps .",
    "each sweep consists of a pseudo - heatbath step with fhkp updating in the @xmath32 subgroups , followed by four over - relaxation steps .",
    "in contrast to the dirichlet conditions in @xcite , we impose anti - periodic boundary conditions on the quarks and periodic boundary conditions on the gluons .",
    "three values of the hopping parameter @xmath33 were used @xmath34 for the improved current , we use the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 as determined by bhattacharya _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "conservation of the total charge generated at the source at @xmath38 provides a test @xcite for our calculation , relating the @xmath13 component of the three - point function for @xmath39 to the two - point function . for our periodic boundary conditions",
    ", it reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "we find that all configurations we use each satisfy this condition to at least 1 ppm .    for the results discussed below , we chose the pion three - momenta such that @xmath42 in units of the minimal momentum @xmath43 for our lattice .",
    "this guarantees for the elastic pion form factor that @xmath44 ; it greatly simplifies the kinematic factors appearing in the three - point function .",
    "different values for the three momentum transfer @xmath45 were obtained by varying the relative orientation of the initial and final pion momenta .    in order to improve the projection onto the ground state",
    ", we smeared the pion operator at the sink in @xmath46 and @xmath47 by the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "we found that a quark - antiquark distance @xmath48 works best .",
    "the quark - antiquark pair was connected by ape smeared gluon links at smearing level @xmath49 and relative weight @xmath50 between straight links and staples .    to extract the desired information from our numerical results",
    ", we assume the two - point function of the pion to have the form @xmath51 including the contribution of the ground state ( n=0 ) and a first excited one ( n=1 ) .",
    "the @xmath52 denote the matrix elements , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 are the energies of ground and excited state , respectively ; the subscript @xmath56 indicates the operator smearing .",
    "the three - point function is parametrised as @xmath57 effects involving , for example , the production of pion pairs , as well as wrap around effects due to the propagation of states beyond @xmath58 are exponentially suppressed ( @xmath59@xmath60 ) ; similarly , an elastic contribution from the excited state was estimated to be of the order of @xmath61 or less .",
    "all these effects are not reflected in our chosen parametrisation .",
    "all parameters in the 2- and 3-point functions - energies @xmath62 , @xmath63-factors and the form factor @xmath64 - were fit simultaneously to the data from all configurations .",
    "for the three - point function , we chose @xmath65 and let the current insertion time @xmath66 vary from @xmath67 to @xmath68 . for maximum spatial symmetry , all values corresponding to the same value @xmath69 in the two - point function and",
    "all @xmath70 yielding the same @xmath45 in the three - point function were combined for the fit .",
    "the value for the parameters and their error in these simultaneous fits was obtained through a single elimination jackknife procedure . since we satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : chargecons ] ) to high accuracy , we show f(0)=1 in the results below instead of using the result from a fit at @xmath71 , which would be less accurate in this case .",
    "our method to extract the pion form factor is non - perturbatively improved in two respects : we use an improved action and an improved current operator .",
    "we can get an impression of the importance of the latter effect by comparing the conserved noether current corresponding to the improved action with the improved current ( which is also conserved ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : icl_comp ] for the lightest of our three quark masses .",
    "the form factor from the improved current is systematically lower than the one from the conserved current .",
    "the difference grows with @xmath72 and reaches about @xmath73 at the largest momentum transfer considered here .     taken from literature ( see text ) .",
    "data for the local current shifted horizontally for clarity._,height=453 ]    the structure of the improved current can be further understood by comparing the improved current to the renormalised local current , @xmath74 which is not conserved . for our kinematics with @xmath75",
    ", we can also extract a form factor from @xmath76 .",
    "it is also shown in fig.[fig : icl_comp ] and can be seen to lie very close to the improved current .",
    "this means that the contribution of the term proportional to @xmath37 in @xmath77 is very small .",
    "closer inspection shows that while the matrix element of the tensor term can become almost comparable to that of the @xmath78 term , the overall tensor contribution is reduced by the small coefficient @xmath37 .",
    "similar statements also hold for our two additional @xmath33-values .     for the three pion masses .",
    "curves : monopole fits to the data._,height=453 ]    it is worth mentioning that with the @xmath79 , @xmath37 and @xmath36 values taken from @xcite , and performing a fit at @xmath71 we obtained @xmath80 to better than @xmath61 with a statistical error of about @xmath81 .    in the previous study @xcite of the pion form factor , where the wilson action was used ,",
    "the results were compared to a monopole form factor @xmath82 a form suggested by vector meson dominance .",
    "we also show in fig.[fig : icl_comp ] a monopole form factor using the value for the @xmath83-mass obtained by interpolating the results from @xcite which uses the same action as we do .",
    "this monopole form factor describes our results for the improved current at all but the highest @xmath72 very well . as in @xcite",
    ", we observe that the conserved current lies consistently above the monopole form factor .",
    "a similar behaviour was found also for our other two @xmath33-values .    in fig.[fig : ff_vmd ] we show our results for improved form factors for all three values for @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding quark- and pion masses are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the form factors systematically decrease with decreasing pion mass .",
    "the form factors for the two lightest pions , with from @xcite . ] @xmath84=541 and 671 mev , come very close together .",
    "as can be seen , the statistical error of the extracted form factors grows as the quark mass decreases .",
    "nevertheless , we are still able to obtain conclusive results for the highest @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding pion mass of 541 mev is substantially lower than in the previous work , where @xmath85 1 gev . given that we have only three data sets , we have not attempted to extrapolate our improved form factor to the physical pion mass .",
    "we also fitted our results for the improved form factors to a monopole form factor . in doing so",
    ", we omitted the highest momentum data point and extracted in each case a vector meson mass , @xmath86 , shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "they are close to the values for @xmath87 taken from interpolations to literature data @xcite .    in examining the two - point green function for various quark - antiquark distances",
    ", we also obtain the bethe - salpeter wavefunction , @xmath88 following the procedure in @xcite , we obtain @xmath89 , shown in table [ table1 ]",
    ".    ._masses and rms - values for the different kappa values , in lattice units .",
    "the @xmath83-mass has been taken from @xcite . _ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these rms - radii are compared to the values extracted from the low-@xmath72 behaviour of the form factor , @xmath90 where in the last step we have assumed a monopole form and use the fitted parameter @xmath91 . in agreement with the findings of @xcite , we see that the bethe - salpeter predictions are very insensitive to the value of the quark or pion mass . however , it is well known @xcite that the information that can be obtained from the bethe - salpeter approach as described above is only an approximation .",
    "it assumes , in the extraction of @xmath92 , that the center of mass of the pion is always halfway between the valence quark and antiquark , not allowing for the motion of the gluons .",
    "the extraction of @xmath92 from the calculated pion form factor does not involve this restriction for the valence ( anti-)quark motion .",
    "as can be seen , the more reliable determination from @xmath64 leads , as expected , to a larger radius .",
    "moreover , this radius shows a substantial dependence on the mass .",
    "we have presented here the first calculation of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion based on an @xmath2 improved action and the concomitant improved vector current .",
    "this is seen to lead to significant changes in the prediction for the internal structure of the pion .",
    "we observe a decrease of the form factor for decreasing pion mass , which in turn leads to an increase of the rms - radius .",
    "this mass - dependence of the radius is not seen in the bethe - salpeter approach .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the pion we reach in our calculations is considerably closer to the physical value than in previous work .",
    "the computational effort involved in taking the improvement into account is small .",
    "since it guarantees elimination of @xmath1 discretisation errors to all orders in the coupling constant , use of this method in future work seems logical in pushing the calculations further towards the physical limit .",
