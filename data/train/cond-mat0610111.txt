    "scale - invariant networks have been subject of intensive study in view of possible insights into inhomogeneous problems such as random magnets , surfaces , porous rocks , aerogels , sponges , etc .",
    "they are relevant to many different real complex situations like biological , social and technological systems @xcite , where the structures can embody a particular graph , e.g. , a scale free network . in this case",
    ", the fraction of sites with @xmath1 connections follows a power law @xcite .",
    "this topology has been found , in particular , on world wide web and internet networks @xcite .",
    "more recently , the area of scale - invariant networks has been highly motivated by the creation of a synthetic nanometer - scale sierpinski hexagonal gasket , a self - similar fractal macromolecule @xcite .",
    "new types of photoelectric cells , molecular batteries and energy storage may be possible .",
    "this perspective is relevant in view of the renewed interest in correlated electron systems on these networks , like studies of quantum magnetism , superconductivity , metal - insulator transition , etc .",
    "an important aspect that can be analyzed is the influence of the topology and the appearance of magnetic order .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate one family of free scale - invariant graphs , the apollonian network @xcite .",
    "the purpose is to examine correlated electrons on apollonian networks .",
    "we explore the connection between the scale - invariant network topology and the magnetic properties of quantum magnetism models , namely , hubbard and anisotropic spin @xmath0 heisenberg models .",
    "we have examined the hubbard model using the small cluster diagonalization @xcite and quantum monte carlo @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg model is studied within a real - space renormalization group framework @xcite .",
    "the construction of the apollonian network has the topology of the contacts of an apollonian packing of two - dimensional disks .",
    "as initial configuration we use , for an apollonian packing , three mutually touching circles inscribed inside a circular space .",
    "the interstices of the initial disks define a curvilinear triangle to be filled . in the next iteration ,",
    "four disks are inscribed , each touching all the sides of the corresponding curvilinear triangle .",
    "this process is repeated indefinitely by setting disks in the newly generated curvilinear triangles .",
    "the apollonian packing is a fractal whose dimension has been estimated as 1.3057 @xcite .    the apollonian network ( an ) is derived from the two - dimensional apollonian packing associating vertices with the circles and connecting two vertices if the corresponding circles touch .",
    "fig 1 shows the first three generations of the an . with this construction procedure one obtains a deterministic scale free network where the number of sites at iteration @xmath2 is @xmath3 . besides being a scale - free network ,",
    "the an has interesting properties like being euclidean , matching and space - filling @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "the models are briefly introduced in section ii .",
    "the results for ground - state and thermodynamic properties of the hubbard model on an are presented in section iii and iv , respectively .",
    "the phase diagram of the quantum anisotropic heisenberg model is discussed in section v and conclusions are presented in section vi .",
    "our study of the magnetic properties on an are based on the hubbard model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard model is defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the creation , anihilation and number operators for an electron with spin @xmath8 in an orbital localized at site @xmath9 ; the @xmath10 sum runs over nearest - neighbor sites on an @xcite",
    ".    the question of magnetic order in the one - band hubbard model has been investigated by several authors and much controversy has arisen . in the strong - coupling limit a major part of the ferromagnetic phase is predicted . in this case , at half filling band , @xmath11 is much larger than @xmath12 , and the hubbard model , using a suitable expansion in perturbation theory , is formally equivalent to the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model .",
    "the heisenberg exchange parameter @xmath13 is written in terms of the hubbard model parameters as @xmath14 , where the hamiltonian of the heisenberg model is defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total spin @xmath0 operator for the @xmath9th site . here",
    "we study the anisotropic heisenberg model to compare the behavior for different values of the anisotropy parameter @xcite .",
    "we have obtained exact numerical results of the hubbard model defined on second generation of the an , corresponding to seven sites .",
    "we computed all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian of eq . 1 on a basis of states for which the occupation number is diagonal .",

    "the double degeneracy in second level forms a triplet in lowest energy for the four electrons case . for two , three ,",
    "five , six and seven electrons the ground state always has minimum spin .",
    "we observe that the coulombian interaction does not favour the occurrence of a high spin ground state .",
    "if @xmath21 is strong , the jumps of electrons decrease and a frustrated ordered antiferromagnet is favored .",
    "we easily see that the network is not bipartite , so its structure is antiferomagnetically frustrated . we find a similar competition , between interaction and frustration , in the low - temperature antiferromagnetic state on a triangular lattice @xcite .",

    ", this limit represents the eight electrons case for @xmath51 .",
    "we can see that if @xmath21 increases the alignment of spins also increases , in such a manner that , for @xmath52 , the ferromagnetic state with the maximum total spin is the ground state . for more than eight electrons ferrmagnetism",
    "is possible , but not stronger than in the case of completely saturated ferromagnetism .",
    "in general , the behavior of short(or long)-range ordering can be better observed studying the spin - spin correlation function . considering the azimuthal spin operator on site",
    "@xmath9 as @xmath53 , the spin - spin correlation function is defined , for @xmath54 sites , as @xmath55 the quantity @xmath56 , called local moment , depends on the magnitude of the difference between up and down electron spin at each site .",

    "@xmath64 is positive , @xmath63 is negative , and an antiferromagnetic order appear . for @xmath67 there is a change in the spatial symmetry of the ground state .",
    "it is important to observe the discontinuous change of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this quantum transition point at @xmath67 must not be a mott metal - insulator transition because @xmath61 is continuous @xcite . for @xmath51 , @xmath56 is approximately equal to @xmath68 and we can conclude that each site is occupied by just one electron .",
    "our results indicate that the system can present a ferrimagnetic order , however , because the size of the network considered , the ferrimagnetic state has minimum spin @xmath23 , and we can not have high spin ground state . for @xmath69 ,",
    "@xmath64 is negative and the magnetic behavior of the ground state is more complex .",
    "we analyse the wave function of the ground state , defining @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the @xmath2th component of the ground eigenstate .",
    "we define the total antiferromagnetic configuration ( @xmath72 ) such that sites introduced in the first generation on an ( represented by squares in fig",
    ". 1 ) are occupied by electrons of a type of spin and sites introduced in second generation ( represented by diamonds in fig . 1 )",
    "are occupied by electrons of opposite spin .",
    "we observe that @xmath73 for @xmath49 and increases to @xmath74 if @xmath65 , for all @xmath75 , i.e. , the total antiferromagnetic configuration @xmath76 is approximately @xmath77 times for @xmath49 and @xmath78 times for @xmath65 , more probable than any another configuration .",

    "on one hand , we study the thermodynamic properties of the half - filled band hubbard model using the method of small - cluster exact - diagonalization calculations in the grand canonical ensemble @xcite . we have calculated all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for an of 7 sites . on the other hand ,",
    "we study lattices of 63 and 124 sites using the grand canonical quantum monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "we used a discrete hubbard - stratonovich transformation to convert the problem into one of free particles interacting with a time - dependent ising field , together with an exact updating algorithm for the fermions green s function to compute the relative weights of the ising configurations .",
    "we consider several values of @xmath21 for all the studied thermodynamic properties .",
    "we determine with considerable accuracy the temperature dependence of the spin - spin correlation functions , spin susceptibility , specific heat , double occupancy and one electron transfer .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath61 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 for some typical values of @xmath21 is shown in figs .",
    "if @xmath21 increases , @xmath61 gradually increases for @xmath62 , indicating that electrons are gradually localizing . at high temperature @xmath61 gradually decreases and electrons gradually delocalize . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the temperature dependence with negative signs of @xmath63 induces an antiferromagetic ordering .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "3b shows monte carlo results for an with 7 , 43 and 124 sites and @xmath79 .",
    "results for 43 and 124 sites do not reveal any new behavior , however , the antiferromagetic ordering increases .",
    "we observe that the properties obtained for 7 sites must be qualitatively equivalent to those for larger an .",
    "we observe a competition between interaction and frustration in the ordered antiferromagnetic state by the analysis of @xmath64 . for small or intermediary @xmath21 , the negative sign of @xmath64",
    "is a result of the frustrated structure of an , disfavoring the antiferromagnetic order . for @xmath51",
    ", @xmath64 has positive sign , showing that the strong electron interaction favors the antiferromagnetic order .",
    "4 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath80 .",
    "the curie - weiss behavior , @xmath81 , is observed for high temperatures . for small and intermediary @xmath21 the curves present a peak .",
    "the temperature associated with the peak of @xmath80 corresponds approximately to the rapid decay of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and is a consequence of the collective excitations that lead to the destruction of the antiferromagetic order @xcite . here",
    "the ground state has spin @xmath23 and @xmath82 must go to infinity at temperature @xmath83 .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath80 with @xmath79 for 7 , 43 and 124 sites on an using monte carlo method is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "4 . in this case , we do not see any discrepancy between the results for different clusters .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat is shown in fig . 5 for typical values of @xmath21 . for small values of @xmath21 there is a peak in the specific heat .",
    "increasing @xmath21 , the peak splits into two , which reflects a rearrangement of the fermionic structure in the system .",
    "the low - temperature peak arises due to low - lying collective excitations , while the high - temperature broad peak comes from single - particle excitations .",
    "this behavior is quite general and has been noticed for different structures @xcite .",
    "next , we study the thermal average of the double occupancy @xmath84 and of the one - electron transfer defined by @xmath85 fig . 6",
    "shows the temperature dependence of @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( inset ) with @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the an with 124 sites .",
    "clearly these functions are related to the local moment .",
    "it is easy to show that for the half - filled band @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath21 increases , the local moment increases ( see fig . 3a ) and the double occupation and one - electron transfer decrease . in the strong coupling limit ( @xmath51 )",
    "each site is occupied by just one electron and the electronic itinerancy vanishes .",
    "this region is characterized by localized magnetism and we can apply the heisenberg model .",
    "the fractal and self - similar nature of scale - invariant networks , generated through a recursive procedure , offer an appropriated way to get rigorous result at the phase transition .",
    "the difficulty with the spin - decimation process which leads to the renormalization - group equation as found on bravais lattices due to parameter proliferation , disappears on scale - invariant networks @xcite . due to the fact that fractal lattices are characterized by dilation invariance but do not have translational invariance , the study on these networks can with restriction be used to model bravais lattices .",
    "particularly self - similar networks can mimick bravais lattices for some magnetic models , providing equal critical temperatures and exponents @xcite .",
