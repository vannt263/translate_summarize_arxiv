    "the navier - stokes equations ( ns ) , while comprising the complete dynamics of turbulence , have at least two disadvantages for theoretical investigation of the physics of turbulence : ns lacks analytical solution for the case of the fully turbulent state and the nonlinear advection term results in turbulent states of high complexity which tends to obscure the fundamental mechanisms underlying the turbulence .",
    "one approach to overcoming these impediments has been the search for simplifications of ns that retain essential features of the turbulence dynamics .",
    "the linearized navier - stokes equations ( lns ) provide one example of the successful application of this approach in which the power of linear systems theory is made available to the study of turbulence  @xcite .",
    "the lns system captures the non - normal mechanism responsible for perturbation growth in ns  @xcite .",
    "this linear mechanism retained in lns underlies both the process of subcritical transition to turbulence and the maintenance of the turbulent state  @xcite",
    ". however , linear models are unable to capture other essential phenomena in turbulence that are intrinsically nonlinear including establishment of the turbulent mean velocity profile and maintenance of turbulence in a statistically steady state in the absence of extrinsic excitation , the mechanism of which is referred to as the self - sustaining process ( ssp ) . while there remain many further aspects of the turbulent state to be addressed , such as the structures and spectrum of the inertial subrange , a basis of understanding of wall turbulence comprises these fundamental aspects .",
    "one approach to studying these phenomena that has proven successful is to impose simplifications that isolate certain mechanisms of the turbulence dynamics .",
    "an example is restricting the size of the channel  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the minimal channel for sustaining turbulence isolated the streak structure component of the ssp and showed that the ssp cycle comprises interaction among the streak , a pair of streamwise vortices of opposite sign ( referred to as a rolls ) and the perturbation field .",
    "in minimal channel turbulence a single streak fits in the channel and the streamwise extent of the channel is of such length that the perturbations can adopt a structure allowing them to extract energy from the mean flow through a time dependent interaction  @xcite .",
    "another example is imposing simplification of the dynamics by isolating specific regions of the turbulent flow .",
    "for example , it was found that when the inner and outer regions of the flow are isolated the turbulence was independently maintained in each region arguing that an independent ssp is operating in these regions  @xcite .",
    "the minimal channel flow studies referred to above focused attention on the effort to obtain a self - consistent dynamical description of the interaction among the streak , the roll and the perturbation field .",
    "the streaks in minimal simulations are associated with the zero streamwise harmonic ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this observation motivates constructing a reduced complexity turbulence model based on the simplest closure of the lns equations , which govern interaction between the streamwise mean flow ( with the streak structure included ) and the streamwise varying perturbation field ( characterized by the @xmath1 flow field ) .",
    "this system is obtained by augmenting lns by only the nonlinearity resulting from including the feedback of the @xmath1 perturbations on the @xmath0 streamwise mean flow .",
    "this dynamics , which greatly restricts the nonlinearity of the ns , will be referred to as the restricted nonlinear system ( rnl ) .",
    "remarkably , as will be demonstrated in this work , the rnl self - sustains a realistic turbulent state , not only in minimal channels at low reynolds numbers , but also in large channels and at moderate reynolds numbers .",
    "the rnl system was introduced here as a simple extension of lns that supports self - sustained turbulence .",
    "however , the rnl has deeper roots : it approximates the second order cumulant closure of the ns , which is the basis of the stochastic structural stability theory ( s3 t ) .",
    "s3 t defines a statistical mean state dynamical system and implementations of this system have recently been used to develop theories of turbulence  @xcite .",
    "s3 t employs an ensemble closure which produces autonomous statistical mean state dynamics in which turbulent mean states exist as statistical equilibria .",
    "this makes the turbulent state available as an object for stability study , extending classical hydrodynamic stability theory which addresses only the stability of stationary sample state solutions of the ns .",
    "s3 t , in contrast , can be used to determine the structural stability of statistical mean state entities such as attractors ( characterised by a specific probability density function ) , so that for instance , when such an attractor becomes s3 t unstable the fluid state bifurcates to a new attractor characterized by a different probability density function .",
    "an example application of s3 t is to a constant shear flow subjected to homogeneous turbulence excitation in which it is found that a bifurcation occurs when the reynolds number exceeds a critical value resulting in a new stationary state comprising the mean flow with a roll - streak structure and a perturbation field supporting it in a new statistical steady state  @xcite . at even higher reynolds number",
    "a saddle - node bifurcation occurs in the s3 t system and the flow transitions to a time dependent state that self - sustains , which is identified with transition to the turbulent state . in the self - sustaining turbulent state",
    "the statistical mean state dynamics of s3 t approaches the deterministic dynamics of the rnl .",
    "recent work has exploited s3 t dynamics to explore the role of streamwise coherent structures in turbulence , including the dynamics of the roll and streak structures  @xcite . in this paper , we verify predictions of s3 t for turbulence structure at high reynolds numbers in pressure driven channel flow , by comparing flow statistics , structures , and dynamical diagnostics obtained from the rnl system to results obtained in the s3 t system and to direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the full ns equations .",

    "[ fig : usdotyomxdoty ] .",

    "@xmath29 velocity is smaller in the ns than in the rnl , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : uyvrmsusrms ] , implying greater streamwise vorticity dissipation in the ns .",
    "it could be argued that the positive value of the generation @xmath130 found in ns and rnl is a consequence of the finite streamwise extent of the channel and as the channel length increases , assuming that there is no systematic correlation between streamwise average torques and streak structure , @xmath130 should decrease as @xmath131 and in the limit of an infinite channel the ns and rnl should sustain no @xmath117 .",
    "however , s3 t theory shows that there is a systematic correlation between streaks and roll generation by perturbation torque resulting from the deformation of the turbulence by the streak and as a result it predicts that in the limit @xmath132 , @xmath130 should asymptote to a finite non - zero value at least in rnl .",
    "having established that the streamwise vorticity in the outer layer is generated in situ from local reynolds stress divergences we conclude that the ssp cycle is operational in the outer layer just as in the inner layer .",
    "we have established that rnl self - sustains turbulence at moderate reynolds numbers in pressure driven channel flow , despite its greatly simplified dynamics when compared to ns .",
    "remarkably , in the rnl system , the turbulent state is maintained by a small set of structures with low streamwise wavenumber fourier components ( at @xmath59 with the chosen channel the ssp involves only the @xmath0 streamwise mean and the next @xmath133 streamwise fourier components )",
    ". not only that , but this minimal turbulent dynamics arises spontaneously when the rnl system is initialized by ns turbulence at the same reynolds number . in this way rnl spontaneously produces a turbulent state of reduced complexity .",
    "rnl identifies an exquisitely contrived ssp cycle which has been previously identified to comprise the generation of the streak through lift - up by the rolls , the maintenance of the rolls by torques induced by the perturbations which themselves are maintained by an essentially time - dependent parametric non - normal interaction with the streak ( rather than e.g.  inflectional instability of the streak structure )  @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the lyapunov exponent associated with the ssp is indicative of a feedback control process acting between the streaks and the perturbations by which the parametric instability that sustains the perturbations on the time dependent streak is reduced to zero lyapunov exponent , so that the turbulence neither diverges nor decays .",
    "we have established that both ns and rnl produce a roll / streak structure in the outer layer and that an ssp is operating there despite the low shear in this region .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere that turbulence self - sustains in the log layer in the absence of boundaries  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our finding that an ssp cycle exists in both the inner - layer and outer - layer .",
    "the turbulence maintained in rnl is closely related to its associated ns turbulence and both exhibit a log layer , although with substantially different von krmn constants .",
    "existence of a log layer is a fundamental requirement of asymptotic matching between regions with different spatial scaling , as was noted by millikan  @xcite .",
    "however , the exact value of the von krmn constant does not have a similar fundamental basis in analysis and rnl turbulence , which is closely related to ns turbulence but more efficient in producing reynolds stress , maintains as a consequence a smaller shear and therefore greater von krmn constant .",
    "specifically , we have determined that the ssp cycle in rnl is characterized by a more energetic and larger scale perturbation structure , despite having a lower amplitude streak and mean shear .",
    "formation of roll / streak structures in the log layer is consistent with the universal mechanism by which turbulence is modified by the presence of a streak in such way as to induce growth of a roll structure configured to lead to continued growth of the original streak .",
    "this growth process underlies the non - normal parametric mechanism of maintaining the perturbation variance in the ssp that maintains turbulence if the reynolds number is large enough  @xcite .",
    "this universal mechanism does not predict nor require that the roll / streak structures be of finite streamwise extent and in its simplest form it has been demonstrated that it supports roll / streak structures with zero streamwise wavenumber . from this point of view",
    "the observed length of roll / streak structures is not a consequence of the primary mechanism of the ssp supporting them but rather a secondary effect of disruption by the turbulence . in this work",
    "we have provided evidence that ns turbulence is persuasively related in its dynamics to rnl turbulence . moreover , given that the dynamics of rnl turbulence can be understood fundamentally from its direct relation with s3 t turbulence we conclude that the mechanism of turbulence in wall bounded shear flow is the roll / streak / perturbation ssp that was previously identified to maintain s3 t turbulence .",
