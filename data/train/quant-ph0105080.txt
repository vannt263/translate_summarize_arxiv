    "in last decades , the phenomenon of entanglement between two spatially separated photons was investigated both experimentally and theoretically mainly in order to show that quantum mechanics is not a local realistic theory @xcite . as a counterpart to the particle - like behavior of photons ,",
    "the entanglement of coherent states , that can be considered as the quantum analogue of deterministic light waves , was examined @xcite . in both the cases ,",
    "the entangled states , that were used to test bell inequalities , were usually considered to be pure states .",
    "recently , the entanglement of mixed states has been analysed to understand , how the disorder influences on the amount of entanglement @xcite .    in this report , we examine a new situation , when an entangling device prepares the entangled states of radiation from mixed states ( thermal or pseudo - thermal light ) at the input . similarly to the idea presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the entangling device can produce a four - mode entangled state with two mixed states and two vacuum states .",
    "it is shown , that even for very disordered states bell inequalities can strongly be violated .",
    "if there is a narrow frequency portion of thermal radiation in the input of the entangling device then bell inequalities are violated when the frequency of radiation is `` low '' and the temperature of thermal source is `` high '' .",
    "for a pseudo - thermal radiation the violation of bell inequalities is even more significant .",
    "in addition , the violation can be enhanced for both the cases of radiations , if a lot of different modes are entangled with vacuum state .",
    "thus almost the maximal bell inequality violation can be achieved with such thermal states exhibiting a large entropy .",
    "we consider two separate systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 which consist locally of two modes @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "all modes are initially unentangled .",
    "we further assume that the density matrices of these four modes are diagonal in orthonormal fock ( number - state ) bases @xmath6 and that the modes @xmath3 and @xmath5 are in vacuum states , @xmath7 .",
    "now , one can consider a conditional operation which enables to prepare the following entangled states ( for @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) @xmath10 , the analogue of a singlet state , that was often employed to test bell - type inequalities .",
    "thus the initial density matrix @xmath11 is transformed into the form @xmath12^{-1 } = ( 1- p_0 r_0)^{-1}$ ] .    if there is at least one @xmath13 and one @xmath14 such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 then state ( [ final ] ) is entangled .",
    "it can be proved in a very straightforward way using the so called transposition criterion @xcite .",
    "this criterion says that if operator @xmath17 , obtained from @xmath18 by partial transposition in subsystem @xmath1 , is not positive the state @xmath18 is entangled .",
    "partial transposition of @xmath19 in basis @xmath20 now , let us suppose vector @xmath21 where @xmath22 and calculate the following mean value @xmath23 if @xmath24 and @xmath25 , this quantity is _",
    "negative_. on the other hand , the entanglement of discussed states can often be `` masked '' by the noise of original mixed states .",
    "e.g. , conditional von neumann entropy , @xmath26 , is positive for many particular cases here .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that the entanglement is `` strong '' enough to violate chsh - bell inequality .",
    "the proposed conditional operation can be , in principle , realized in the following way ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) @xcite : let us assume a mach - zehnder ( m - z ) interferometer with equal - length arms and with one photon in its input",
    ". into both the arms of the interferometer we insert a nonlinear kerr medium effectively described by the following interaction hamiltonian @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the creation and annihilation operators of the mode corresponding to the left ( or right ) arm in the m - z interferometer , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , are the creation and annihilation operators of modes @xmath2 ( or @xmath4 ) , and @xmath33 is a real interaction constant .    if there is a photon in the left arm of the central m - z interferometer and the product @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an effective interaction time , has the meaning of the parameter of the device .",
    "it is not a usual time variable .",
    "it represents the effective expression of the fact that the nonlinear medium has finite dimensions .",
    "] is set to be equal exactly to @xmath36 then the described device realizes the phase shift @xmath36 in the left m - z interferometer , @xmath0 , and effectively flips the modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 on the output . on the other hand , if there is no photon in the left arm then the states of modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 stay unchanged , @xmath37 the same is true about the right arm of the central m - z interferometer and modes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these unitary transformations @xmath38 , @xmath32 , can be expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath41 beam splitter transformation and @xmath42 accounts for the nonlinear interaction in kerr medium , @xmath43 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\hat{u}_{i , i}&=&\\exp(i\\pi\\hat{a}^{\\dag}\\hat{a}\\hat{a}_{i1}^{\\dag}\\hat{a}_{i1}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , if the photon goes through the left arm the modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 are flipped while the state of system @xmath1 is unchanged . completely symmetrical situation occurs , if the photon goes through the right arm .    due to the path uncertainty of the photon in the interferometer the state of the whole system after the interaction",
    "is given by the formula @xmath44 ( the last one in the m - z interferometer ) followed by two photodetectors @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "depending on which one of these two detectors fires we obtain one of two possible output states of modes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "detector @xmath45 fires with probability @xmath47 and if it clicks the following state is obtained latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     \\nonumber\\\\ & & + |0\\rangle_{a1}|n\\rangle_{a2 }    @xmath46 clicks with probability @xmath49 and when it fires one obtains the state @xmath50 ) .",
    "in order to demonstrate the violation of bell inequalities one needs local operations analogous to spin rotations . in our particular case",
    "the following operations do the job @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the parameter of transformation , it does not depend on @xmath53 .",
    "bell - type experiment consists of two `` rotations '' according to recipe ( [ operace ] ) , performed by two possibly space - like separated observers , followed by realistic yes  no detection on each mode .",
    "each such detection has only two possible outcomes ( detector either fires or it does not ) , that can be described by projectors @xmath54 ( for `` no '' ) and @xmath55 ( for `` yes '' ) .",
    "let us assign the following values to these outcomes : @xmath56=0 if the detector ( in mode @xmath57 ) is quiet and @xmath56=1 if it clicks .",
    "then the results @xmath58 and @xmath59 of local two - mode measurements ( including `` rotations '' ) performed by the first and the second observer , respectively , can be expressed as @xmath60 after the experiment is repeated many times and our two observers compare their results , the mean value of bell operator ( for chsh inequalities ) can be estimated , @xmath61 where correlation function @xmath62 ( summations go over all possible results ) .",
    "every local - realistic theory @xcite must fulfill the following inequality @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "however , it follows from straightforward quantum - mechanical calculations that for state ( [ final ] ) the correlation function ( [ corr ] ) reads @xmath64 \\frac{(1-p_0)(1-r_0)}{1-p_0 r_0}.\\ ] ] therefore the results of the above mentioned local measurements performed on state ( [ final ] ) _ violate _ inequality @xmath65 in principial .",
    "maximal violation , @xmath66 occurs for the angles @xmath67 if both the mixed states have the same overlap with vacuum state @xmath68 , the condition for the violation of bell inequality for the considered angles is given in a simple form @xmath69 as one can see the maximum value of @xmath70 depends on the probability of the presence of the vacuum state in the input density matrices .",
    "thus , if the input density matrices of systems @xmath2 and @xmath4 do not contain the vacuum state the maximal violation of chsh - bell inequality is the same as for the pure epr maximally entangled state of two spin - half particles . in the opposite case , the mean value of bell operator decreases as the contribution of the vacuum state increases in the mixtures .",
    "it should be noticed that for properly chosen local measurements the violation of chsh - bell inequality does not depend on the randomness contained in the mixture but only on the overlaps of the vacuum state and the input density matrices .",
    "there are two mixed states of special interest , namely thermal radiation , exhibiting bose - einstein statistics , and pseudo - thermal radiation , exhibiting poissonian statistics .",
    "let us study now the entangled states prepared by the device proposed in sec .",
    "[ device ] when thermal and pseudo - thermal states are at the input .",
    "a single mode of thermal radiation has the density matrix @xmath71 where @xmath72 for example , if the temperature of a radiation source ( e.g. , incandescent lamp ) @xmath73k and the optical frequency @xmath74hz , the mean value of photon number is @xmath75 .",
    "the probability of the vacuum state in the mixture is @xmath76 what leads to the value @xmath77 for the above given data .",
    "thus in the optical region , the overlap of vacuum and thermal light is too large and the bell - inequality violation does not occur .",
    "the dependence of the maximal bell - inequality violation on the parameter @xmath78 , @xmath32 of particular modes @xmath2 , @xmath4 can be simply evaluated : @xmath79 and it is displayed in fig .  [ fig2 ] . only for very small @xmath80 and @xmath81 ,",
    "i.e. , for high temperatures and small frequencies , chsh - bell inequality is violated .",
    "thus for the given temperature @xmath82 of both the thermal sources the infrared component of radiation gives better results than the ultra - violate one . on the other hand , for the fixed frequency @xmath83 of both the sources",
    "the higher temperature leads to the stronger violation of bell inequality .",
    "if both the sources are identical the bell - inequality violation occurs only if the dimensionless parameter @xmath84 satisfies relation @xmath85 or the mean number @xmath86 is sufficiently large @xmath87 .",
    "consequently , for the visible component of radiation the thermal sources must have an `` astronomical '' temperature @xmath88 , whereas for the infrared component with @xmath89 , temperature @xmath90 is sufficient to obtain bell - inequality violation .",
    "another interesting kind of mixed state is that corresponding to pseudo - thermal light @xcite .",
    "its density matrix can be written as @xmath91 pseudo - thermal radiation can be obtained from an intensity - stabilized single mode laser with the phase uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath92 .",
    "in contrast to thermal radiation , the maximally probable state in the mixture ( [ pseudo ] ) is not vacuum state but it is state @xmath93 , where @xmath53 corresponds approximately to the mean number of photons @xmath94 .",
    "thus the overlap of pseudo - thermal light with the vacuum state is much less than for thermal light .",
    "the probability of the vacuum state in the density matrix ( [ pseudo ] ) is @xmath95 .",
    "this leads to maximal bell - inequality violation @xmath96[1-\\exp(-\\langle n\\rangle_{b})]}{1-\\exp[-(\\langle n\\rangle_{a}+\\langle n\\rangle_{b})]}.\\ ] ] from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] one can see that in the case of pseudo - thermal light the bell - inequality violation is achieved for less @xmath97 and @xmath98 than in the case of thermal light .",
    "if one considers two identical pseudothermal sources , then the bell inequality is violated if @xmath99 .",
    "as the pseudo - thermal light with such a mean photon number can be experimentally achieved from the laser light in optical frequencies , the violation can be obtained more simply than for the thermal light .",
    "real light sources emit to a large amount of different independent modes .",
    "the density matrix of this multi - mode state is given in the following form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is photon number for particular mode @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the fock state of the corresponding mode .",
    "let us suppose that this multi - mode thermal state is feeded to the inputs @xmath2 and @xmath4 and the multi - mode vacuum states are present in the inputs @xmath3 and @xmath5 . the analysis presented in sec .",
    "iii may be generalized to multi - mode light in a straightforward way .",
    "we define the `` rotations '' of the multi - mode vacuum @xmath104 and any excited multi - mode state @xmath105 as follows , @xmath106 for @xmath107 , and for multi - mode vacuum in both the modes : @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "it can be shown that the maximal violation of bell inequality exhibits the same form ( [ max ] ) as in the case of single - mode radiation , but with the following notation @xmath110 with increasing number of the modes of thermal radiation the effective overlap of vacuum state and such a multi - mode field decreases and , consequently , the maximal violation of bell inequality is enhanced .",
    "in this way , the bell inequality violation can be achieved for every thermal radiation , if the sufficient number of modes is taken into account .",
    "an entangling device employing non - linear dynamics and postselection has been proposed and it has been shown that two mixed states can be entangled in such a way that the entanglement of the resulting state is strong enough to violate bell inequalities ( when proper local measurements are chosen ) .",
    "the disorder due to the statistical nature of the density matrices of input states is irrelevant  it does not influence the violation of bell inequality .",
    "the only parameters affecting the maximum of the mean value of bell operator are overlaps @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "this is also the reason of a contra - intuitive behavior when the entanglement increases as the input thermal state becomes more ` classical ' ( @xmath113 ) , whereas in the ` quantum ' limit ( @xmath114 ) the entanglement vanishes .",
    "another contra - intuitive aspect of this phenomena appears if the multi - mode thermal radiation is considered .",
    "since the overlap with multimode vacuum becomes smaller as the number of modes increases , the multi - mode thermal radiation can violate bell inequality more notably , irrespective of its larger entropy .",
    "thus this `` classical - like '' radiation can be strongly entangled in the ideal case and even exhibit the pronounced quantum nonlocality .",
    "unfortunately , like the other kinds of mesoscopic states , the described quantum superpositions are very sensitive to the descructive influence of decoherence and losses .",
