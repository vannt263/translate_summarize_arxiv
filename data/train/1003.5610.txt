    "recently physicist are interested in modeling various social phenomena , e.g. opinion evolution , culture migration or language dynamics @xcite .",
    "one of such new domains of investigations is emotion research @xcite .",
    "emotions or affective states can be caused by external or internal processes but differences between these two emotion sources are sometimes hard to distinguish @xcite .",
    "an external emotion - arousing event comes usually as a result of interactions with environment .",
    "the case when emotions are changing or emerging without any influence of external factors corresponds to spontaneous emotional arousals .",
    "the important feature of an affective state is its short life time @xcite .",
    "phenomena of emergence and decline of an emotion are usually fast and unexpected processes which are frequently difficult to control or to predict . in other words : emotions evolve on the spur of the moment . in the situation",
    "when neither external nor internal emotion generating processes take place , the emotion relaxes to a non - affective ( neutral ) state . in general , one can say that emotions are positive or negative .",
    "i.e. they possess a positive or a negative valence .",
    "what is important , emotions are always directed towards somebody or something @xcite .",
    "it means that the emotional valence has an influence on actions of an individual and can also affect other people . as a result , in a moment of affective interaction we can define an emotional emitter and an emotional receiver .",
    "it is obvious that they can change their roles in time .",
    "social interactions take place in social space @xcite .",
    "as we observe in everyday life , people are usually much more influenced by emotions of their relatives , friends , acquaintances or partners with common goals than by emotions of strangers .",
    "social relations or common goals frequently increase emotional influence @xcite .",
    "it follows that social distances should be introduced to properly describe affective phenomena .",
    "in our paper we introduce and investigate by numerical simulations a number of models of emotional agents .",
    "the models take into account such features as spontaneous emotional arousal , emotional relaxation and affective interactions between agents .",
    "we study also the influence of emotions on tasks execution efficiency .",
    "we consider the behaviour of agents at the two - dimensional square lattice with the unit lattice constant and the size @xmath4 .",
    "the agent density is @xmath5 thus the total number of agents is @xmath6 .",
    "the agents do not move in space but the agent @xmath7 can change his emotional state @xmath8 in the course of time . for numerical simplicity",
    "we shall assume that the time variable is discrete @xmath9 .",
    "the state @xmath10 will be called emotionally neutral , while the state @xmath11 is emotionally positive ( negative ) .",
    "an emotional state of an agent evolves as a result of three processes : due to inter - agents emotional interactions , due to a process of spontaneous emotional arousal , and due to an emotional relaxation .",
    "the square lattice represents the social space and the social distance between agents @xmath7 , @xmath12 will be assumed as the smallest number of edges at a path between @xmath7 and @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 describe cartesian coordinates of the agent @xmath7 .",
    "initial emotional states of agents @xmath16 are randomly selected with the uniform probability distribution @xmath17 .",
    ".scheme of interactions between emotional emitter and receiver in model 1 [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     during computer simulations we located a positive antenna in the central position of the lattice and we observed how its presence influences emotions of neighbouring and more distant agents . at fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] we observe that the mean emotion of agents at the distance larger than 2 is nearly zero .",
    "the exception is the case @xmath18 where the influence of the antenna is felt at larger distances , see fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] .",
    "the result can be understood as follows . when @xmath19 the positive antenna broadcasts its negative emotions with a probability @xmath20 thus its positive role is not very significant as compared to the case of lower values of @xmath3 .",
    "however when @xmath21 then the positive antenna does not distribute negative emotions but it also does not receive positive emotions from its neighbourhood which is mostly in the neutral state @xmath22 .",
    "it follows there is an optimal value of the transfer probability @xmath3 when the role of antenna is strongest .",
    "[ fig:13 ] shows that the role of antenna increases non - monotonically as a function of probability of spontaneous emotional arousal @xmath0 .",
    "we suppose that this phenomenon follows from a selection of positive emotions that the antenna receives from its neighbourhood .",
    "such positive emotions are more likely for large value of @xmath0 where every agent fluctuates very fast .      it is generally accepted that emotions influence efficiency of various tasks executions , since the presence of negative emotions can sometimes make it impossible to complete a difficult task while positive emotions can motivate a person to find a solution of a difficult problem . of course , counter examples can also be presented , e.g. a high arousal connected with positive emotions can act as an obstacle for efficient work while a feeling of fear can magnify efforts to escape from a dangerous situation .    here , we examine a simple model of emotional influence on task execution efficiency as follows .",
    "let the scalar variable @xmath23 describe the progress in task completed by an agent @xmath7 at time @xmath24 .",
    "let us assume that this progress is only due to the presence of a temporary positive emotion while a temporary negative emotion leads to a partial damage of already completed work . to make our model as simple as possible let us consider the discrete dynamics of the variable @xmath23 in the form :    @xmath25    as the initial condition of every agent we take @xmath26 . to complete his task",
    "the agent needs to reach at certain time moment @xmath24 the level @xmath27 and such a successful event can be considered as a kind of jump over an upper potential barrier @xmath28 . on the other hand , when @xmath29 ( a lower potential barrier ) the agent experiences a failure . a success or",
    "a failure means termination of agent s actions and causes a replacement of the agent @xmath7 by a new agent @xmath12 so during the simulation the number of agents is constant .",
    "the new agent starts his task with @xmath30    to quantify the system efficiency we observe the number @xmath31 of successful agents that completed their tasks during some time window @xmath32 .",
    "results of corresponding simulations are presented at fig.14 and 15 for various values of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "one can observe that the dependences @xmath33 ( see at fig .",
    "[ fig:16 ] and [ fig:17 ] ) and @xmath34 ( see at fig .",
    "[ fig:18 ] and [ fig:19 ] ) are not always monotonic and for specific values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 there are maximal numbers of successful agents .",
    "we can say that for very small values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 agents are not effective at work .",
    "it can be interpreted as follows : a high level of emotions that occurs when the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath0 are large disturbs people to work but when this level is too low individuals do not have enough motivation to undertake difficult tasks . the effect can be called an emotion - task resonance and it reminds the phenomenon of stochastic resonance when there is an optimal level of noise for signal transmission by a nonlinear system .",
    "we have investigated two - dimensional models of affective agents . in the limit of small noise parameter @xmath0 describing the effect of spontaneous emotional arousal",
    "there are large amplitude collective oscillations of mean group emotion @xmath35 although the system dynamics does not contain any inertial part .",
    "as result the mean value of the group emotion is equal to zero .",
    "we suppose that the presence of oscillations and the lack of the spontaneous symmetry breaking are due to individual relaxation processes .",
    "the characteristic oscillations period increases with the value of the relaxation time @xmath1 and the oscillations amplitude increases with probability @xmath3 of local affective interactions . for small values of relaxation times @xmath1 we observed a stochastic resonance , i.e. the signal to noise ratio @xmath2 is maximal for a non - zero @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the presence of emotional antenna can enhance positive or negative emotions and for the optimal transition probability @xmath3 the antenna can change agents emotions at longer distances .",
    "the stochastic resonance has been also observed for the influence of emotions on task execution efficiency , i.e. there are optimal values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 parameters when agents are most successful at completing their tasks .",
    "it suggests that neither completely non - emotional nor very emotional atmosphere should be arranged as working conditions .",
    "when the transfer of emotion between agents is too high ( people are disturbed ) or to low ( they have no motivation ) the task execution efficiency is very low . it is interesting that the optimal @xmath0 and @xmath3 parameters values are similar for both resonance phenomena .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions on emotional phenomena with arvid kappas and dennis kuster .",
