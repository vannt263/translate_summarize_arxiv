    "the cern na57 experiment  @xcite has been designed to study the onset of the multi - strange baryon and antibaryon enhancements in pb - pb collisions with respect to proton - induced reactions , first observed by the wa97 experiment at 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 beam momentum  @xcite .",
    "na57 has extended the wa97 measurements over a wider centrality range and to lower beam momentum : data on pb - pb collisions have been taken at both 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 ( as for wa97 ) and 40 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "measurements of strangeness production at sps have been carried out also by the na49 collaboration  @xcite . + the na57 results on hyperon and antihyperon production at 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1  @xcite confirm the pattern observed by wa97 : the enhancements increase with the strangeness content of the particle up to a factor of about 20 for @xmath4 hyperons . in this paper the absolute yields and the inverse slopes of the transverse mass distributions for @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( and their antiparticles ) in pb - pb collisions at both 40 and 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 are presented and discussed .",
    "the results had been preliminarily shown at the quark matter 2004 conference  @xcite . a comparison with the results from the higher energy au - au collisions at rhic is also included .",
    "the na57 apparatus  @xcite , schematically shown in fig.[figlayout ] , has been designed to detect strange and multi - strange hyperons by reconstructing their weak decays into final states containing charged particles only .",
    "tracks are measured in the silicon telescope , a 30 cm length array of pixel detector planes with 5 @xmath33 5 @xmath34 cross - section .",
    "additional pixel planes and double - sided silicon microstrip detectors , placed behind the telescope , are used as a lever arm to improve the resolution for high momentum tracks . the distance from the target and the angle of inclination of the telescope",
    "were varied with beam momentum in order to cover the central rapidity region .",
    "the telescope acceptance covers about half a unit of rapidity at central rapidity and medium transverse momentum . +",
    "the centrality trigger , based on a scintillator system ( petals ) placed 10 cm downstream of the target , selects approximately the 60% most central fraction of the inelastic cross - section for pb - pb collisions .",
    "the centrality of the collision is measured using the charged particle multiplicity sampled at central rapidity by two stations of microstrip silicon detectors ( msd ) .",
    "+ the full apparatus is placed inside the 1.4 tesla field of the goliath magnet .",
    "about 240 m and 460 m events of central pb - pb collisions have been collected at 40 and 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 respectively .",
    "the following decay channels ( and the corresponding ones for antiparticles ) have been detected : @xmath2 @xmath35 @xmath36 , @xmath5 @xmath35 @xmath37 ( with @xmath2 @xmath35 @xmath36 ) and @xmath6 @xmath35 @xmath38 ( with @xmath2 @xmath35 @xmath36 ) . the particle selection procedure , based on geometrical and kinematical cuts , allows the extraction of signals with negligible background  @xcite .",
    "+ the study of the collision centrality is based on the charged particle multiplicity sampled by the msd in the pseudorapidity ranges 1.9 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath39 3.6 ( for the 40 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 data ) and 2 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath39 4 ( for the 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 data ) , following the analysis procedure described in @xcite . + for each selected particle a weight is calculated by means of a monte carlo procedure based on geant  @xcite that takes into account geometrical acceptance and reconstruction efficiency losses .",
    "the full samples of the reconstructed @xmath3 and @xmath4 hyperons have been individually weighted . since the method is cpu intensive , for the much more abundant @xmath2 and @xmath7 samples we only weighted a small fraction of the total sample in order to reach a statistical error better than the systematic error . + the double differential ( @xmath41 , @xmath42=@xmath43 ) invariant cross section for each particle type has been fitted to an exponential using the maximum likelihood method and the parametrization @xcite :    @xmath44    we assume @xmath45 ( flat rapidity distribution ) within our acceptance region around central rapidity and leave the inverse slope @xmath46 as a free parameter .",
    "+ yields have been calculated as the number of particles per event extrapolated to a common phase space window , covering the full @xmath47 range and one unit of rapidity around mid - rapidity , by using the fitted slopes :    @xmath48",
    "inverse slopes and yields at 40 and 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 have been compared within a centrality range corresponding to the most central 53% of pb - pb collisions : the average number of participants for this sample is about 165 .",
    "+ the @xmath6 and @xmath49 samples have been merged in the same spectrum for the lower energy data , due to the low statistics .",
    "the inverse slope parameters @xmath46 obtained with the fit procedure and the corresponding statistical and systematic errors are given in table 1 .",
    "the values of the @xmath46 parameter at 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 are larger than the corresponding ones at 40 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 for @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "larger errors , due to the limited statistics at lower energy , preclude such comparisons for @xmath8 and @xmath4 hyperons .",
    "the details of the analysis of the transverse mass spectra at 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 are discussed in @xcite .",
    "a similar description of the transverse mass spectra analysis at 40 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 is in preparation .",
    "for all the fits discussed in the present paper we obtained a value of @xmath50/@xmath51 below 2 .",
    "+ these inverse slopes have been used to calculate the particle yields given in table 1 ( according to the formula ( [ eqyield ] ) ) .",
    "statistical and systematic errors are given .",
    "the systematic errors were estimated by varying the analysis procedures , the selection criteria and the extrapolation function .",
    "the slope extracted from the combined spectra of @xmath6 and @xmath49 has been used for the extrapolations .",
    "+ going from 40 to 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 , the @xmath2 and @xmath5 yields at mid - rapidity are similar while the corresponding antiparticle yields increase by a factor 5 . the @xmath4 hyperon production shows a larger increase , with about a factor 3 rise for the particle and more than a factor 7 for the antiparticle .",
    "these results can be understood as due to a higher baryon density in the collision fireball at lower energy .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath2 and @xmath5 yields do not vary much from sps to rhic energies . a clear energy dependence is seen for the three antihyperon yields .",
    "+ the antihyperon to hyperon ratios are plotted in fig.[figratcomp ] as a function of @xmath10 from sps to rhic  @xcite . at rhic",
    "the ratios increase with increasing strangeness content of the hyperon , as already seen at sps energies .",
    "all three ratios also increase as a function of the energy , the dependence being weaker for particles with higher strangeness .",
    "results from na57 on hyperon production in pb - pb collisions at 40 and 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 beam momentum have been presented and compared .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath5 yields per unit rapidity stay roughly constant while those of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 increase when going to the higher sps energy .",
    "+ comparison with higher energy results from the star experiment at rhic confirms the same trend , with hyperons showing a weaker energy dependence than antihyperons .",
    "the antihyperon to hyperon ratios increase with the energy , with a stronger dependence for particles with smaller strangeness content .",
    "such a pattern is consistent with a decrease of baryon density in the central region with increasing energy .",
