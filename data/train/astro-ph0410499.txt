    "with more than 130 extrasolar planets discovered so far , major scientific purposes in this field are rapidly moving from mere detection to characterization of the planetary systems , i.e. , statistics of planetary masses , orbital periods , eccentricities , stellar metallicities , and so on . most of these systems have been discovered through the periodic change of radial velocities of the central stars .",
    "one of them , hd 209458b , was first discovered spectroscopically and was soon later found to exhibit a transit signature in front of the stellar disk for a duration of @xmath3 hr in its orbital period of 3.5 days @xcite .",
    "more recently , a few additional extrasolar planets have been discovered photometrically from a transiting signature in their light curves and later confirmed spectroscopically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , such transiting planets provide important information for the extrasolar planetary systems that is otherwise unavailable : planetary size , atmospheric composition , and the degree of ( mis)alignment of the planetary orbit axis and the stellar spin axis . among others",
    ", @xcite showed that the planetary orbit and the stellar rotation of the hd 209458 system share the same direction ; the planet sequentially blocks off the light from the approaching and then from the receding parts of the stellar surface .",
    "this produces a distortion in the line profiles of the stellar spectrum during the transit in a time - dependent manner , leading to an anomaly of the radial velocity curves , previously known as the rossiter ",
    "mclaughlin ( rm ) effect in eclipsing binary stars @xcite .",
    "the signature of the rm effect was first reported by @xcite and the effect was later isolated and measured by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first attempt at a theoretical study of the rm effect was made by @xcite and the analysis was subsequently extended by @xcite to incorporate the effects of limb and gravity darkening and rotational and tidal distortion . in the context of extrasolar planetary systems , @xcite numerically computed the expected amplitude of the radial velocity anomaly caused by the rm effect .",
    "they first put constraints on the stellar spin angular velocity and its direction angle with respect to the planetary orbit by comparing the observed velocity anomalies .",
    "incidentally , @xcite proposed an interesting suggestion to use the rm effect as an efficient diagnostic of the atmosphere of a transiting planet .",
    "obviously , this methodology provides unique and fundamental clues to understanding the formation process of extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "planets are supposed to form in the proto planetary disk surrounding the proto star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the stellar spin and the planetary orbital axes are expected to be aligned . in turn ,",
    "any constraints on their ( mis)alignment degree are useful clues to the origin of the angular momentum of planets and its subsequent evolution during possible migration of the planets into the close - in orbits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to improve the reliability and precision of such results , analytic templates are of great value . in this paper , we show analytic formulae for radial velocities of transiting extrasolar planets .",
    "those formulae can be used as standard templates in constraining a set of parameters for numerous transiting planets that will be detected in the near future with _",
    "corot _ and _",
    "kepler_.    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : radvel_non - transit ] introduces a variety of parameters that characterize the dynamics of a planetary system and summarizes the radial velocity curve , neglecting the transit effect ( or , equivalently , for a non rotating star ) .",
    "section [ sec : radvel_transit ] shows a general theoretical framework of the rm effect for a star during the planetary transit .",
    "sections [ sec : without_darkening ] and [ sec : limb_darkening ] derive analytic expressions for radial velocity curves ; in  [ sec : without_darkening ] , we consider an idealistic case of the stellar intensity model without limb darkening and derive the exact analytic expressions .",
    "notation used in the derivation of are summarized in table 1 . on this basis ,  [ sec : limb_darkening ] presents approximate formulae taking into account the stellar limb - darkening effect .",
    "we apply these analytic templates to a transiting system , hd 209458 , in ",
    "[ sec : hd209458 ] and examine the sensitivity to the parameters of the system . finally , ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the main conclusions and discussion .",
    "a close - in extrasolar planetary system may have multiple outer planets , but we focus here on a system that is well approximated by a two - body problem , i.e. , one that consists of a central star ( mass @xmath4 ) and a planet ( mass @xmath5 ) . figure [ fig : orbit - topview ] shows the schematic configuration of the top view of the planetary orbit .",
    "the radial velocity curve of the star in the kepler orbit can be described as follows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "first , note that in the strictly two - body problem , the orbit of the planet with respect to the star is simply written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the semimajor axis , @xmath8 is the eccentricity , and @xmath9 is the true anomaly ( angular coordinate measured from the pericenter direction ) . the true anomaly @xmath9 is written in terms of the eccentric anomaly @xmath10 , defined through the circumscribed circle that is concentric with the orbital ellipse as @xmath11 if one introduces the mean motion @xmath12 from the orbital period @xmath13 of the system as @xmath14 then @xmath10 is related to the mean anomaly @xmath15 as ( kepler s equation ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the time of pericenter passage .    using the parameters defined above , the radial velocity of the star along the line of sight of the observer ( see fig . [",
    "fig : orbit - topview ] ) is written as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath19 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the inclination angle between the direction normal to the orbital plane and the observer s line of sight and we define @xmath21 as the longitude of the line of sight with respect to the pericenter ( fig.[fig : orbit - topview ] ) . while @xmath9 is not directly written as a function of the observer s time @xmath22 , it is useful to rewrite equation ( [ eq : radvel_star ] ) explicitly in terms of @xmath23 even in an approximate manner . for this purpose",
    ", one can use the following expansions with respect to the eccentricity @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath24 then equation ( [ eq : radvel_star ] ) up to @xmath25 should read @xmath26 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "an occultation of a part of the rotating stellar surface during transit of the planet causes a time - dependent asymmetric feature in stellar emission / absorption line profiles .",
    "if the line profile is not well resolved , the asymmetry results in an apparent shift of the central line position , which contributes additionally to the overall `` observed '' stellar radial velocity . in order to describe the effect quantitatively",
    ", we set the coordinate system centered at the star so that its @xmath27-axis is directed toward the observer ( fig.[fig : spin - los ] ) .",
    "the @xmath28-axis is chosen so that the stellar rotation axis lies on the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane .",
    "we also define the angle @xmath0 between the @xmath28-axis and the normal vector @xmath29 of the planetary orbit plane projected on the @xmath30-@xmath28 plane ( fig.[fig : orbit - xz ] ) , i.e. , @xmath31 then the position of the planet is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the rotation matrix of an angle @xmath34 around the @xmath35-axis .",
    "in our configuration , the angular velocity of the star is given as @xmath36 then the velocity of a point @xmath37 on the stellar surface is @xmath38 thus , the radiation at frequency @xmath39 from that point suffers from the doppler shift due to the stellar rotation by an amount @xmath40 with respect to the observer located along the @xmath27-axis in the present case .",
    "consider a specific ( emission or absorption ) line whose intensity at a point @xmath41 on the projected stellar surface is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 represents the line profile .",
    "the observed flux is computed by integrating the doppler - shifted intensity at each point over the entire ( projected ) surface of the star : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the distance between the star and the observer .",
    "the factor @xmath46 appears because of the lorentz invariance of the quantity @xmath47 .",
    "while our analysis is applicable to both emission and absorption lines , we consider an emission line centered at @xmath48 in the following , just for definiteness .",
    "then the line profile function satisfies @xmath49 since @xmath43 is supposed to be sharply peaked only around @xmath50 , we have approximately @xmath51 for an arbitrary smooth function @xmath52 .",
    "if the resolution of the observational spectrograph were sufficiently high , the line profiles of the star and the planetary shadow would be separated , or at least the asymmetric feature might be detected for transiting systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in reality , however , such a high spectral resolution is quite demanding , and here we assume a somewhat lower resolution .",
    "thus , we simply compute the resulting time - dependent shift of the line - profile - weighted mean position @xmath53 due to an asymmetric occultation of the stellar surface during the passage of the transiting planet . using expression ( [ eq : doppler - flux ] ) and the properties of the line profile function ( eqs . [",
    "[ eq : line_profile1 ] ] to [ [ eq : line_profile3 ] ] ) , we obtain @xmath54 since the amplitude of the doppler shift ( eq.[[eq : doppler - shift ] ] ) is small , one can safely expand @xmath55 up to the leading order of @xmath56 as @xmath57 therefore , the `` apparent '' radial stellar velocity anomaly due to the rm effect is expressed as @xmath58 equation ( [ eq : delta_vs ] ) is the basic relation between @xmath59 and @xmath60 in our subsequent analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : radvel360 ] shows a schematic illustration of the rm effect .",
    "depending on the inclination and the orbital rotation direction relative to the stellar spin axis , the velocity curve anomaly due to the rm effect exhibits rather different behavior .",
    "the remaining task is to evaluate the integrals adopting a certain model of a stellar surface intensity @xmath59 .",
    "note that previous literature in the analytic study of radial velocity curves focused on expressing the integrals in the radial velocity shift ( [ eq : delta_vs ] ) in terms of kopal s associated @xmath61-functions under some model assumptions of the stellar intensity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while such detailed and exact approaches are required for stellar eclipsing binaries , the evaluation of the @xmath61-function is a demanding numerical task .",
    "furthermore , for those systems a variety of effects become important , including limb darkening , distortion of stars due to their rotation and tidal interaction , the reflection effect ( heating by the radiant energy of the companion ) , and gravity darkening ( variation of the surface brightness due to the local surface gravity acceleration change ) .",
    "for the extrasolar planetary systems , on the other hand , the radius and mass of a planet are significantly smaller than those of the host star .",
    "thus , most of those effects can be safely neglected , and one can derive simpler , and still practically useful , analytic formulae applying perturbative expansion . in what follows ,",
    "we present such analytic expressions for the rm effect with and without the stellar limb darkening .",
    "as a step toward an analytic model for the rm effect for extrasolar planetary systems , let us consider first an idealistic case in which the limb - darkening effect is neglected .",
    "we also assume that the planet is completely optically thick and not rotating , which is also assumed in the next section . in this case , one can obtain the exact analytic expression even without the perturbative expansion .",
    "the intensity at @xmath41 on the uniform stellar surface becomes @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the position of the center of the planet and @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the radii of the star and the planet , respectively .",
    "we evaluate equation ( [ eq : delta_vs ] ) at complete transit , ingress , and egress phases in the following subsections ( see fig.[fig : planet - star ] ) .      during a complete transit phase ,",
    "the position of the planet satisfies the relation @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the range of the integral in equation ( [ eq : delta_vs ] ) is simply given by the stellar surface area with the entire planetary disk sutracted , i.e. , @xmath67 then we obtain @xmath68 substituting these results into equation ( [ eq : delta_vs ] ) , we find @xmath69 equation ( [ eq : v_s_complete ] ) implies that the time dependence of the rm effect during the complete transit is entirely incorporated in the planet position , i.e. , @xmath70 .      at ingress and egress phases , on the other hand ,",
    "the location of the planet satisfies the relation , @xmath71 . just for computational convenience ,",
    "we rotate the coordinates in a time - dependent manner so that the planet is always located along the new @xmath30-axis : @xmath72 then the position of the planet is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 in the new coordinates , equation ( [ eq : ixz ] ) is rewritten as @xmath75 and the moments of the intensity reduce to @xmath76 where the range of the integrals denoted by @xmath77 indicates the overlapping region between the stellar and the planetary disks and can be explicitly written as ( _ dark shaded regions _ , fig .",
    "[ fig : ingress ] ) : @xmath78 note that the planetary and stellar circles intersect at @xmath79 , where @xmath80 } } { 2(1+\\eta_p)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us also introduce @xmath81 physically speaking , this corresponds to the separation between the intersection and the center of the planet along the @xmath82 axis , but we allow @xmath83 to be negative ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ingress ] ) as well .",
    "then equations ( [ eq : moment1 ] ) and ( [ eq : moment2 ] ) are analytically integrated as @xmath84 ,   \\label{eq : integral1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath85 ,   \\label{eq : integral2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .    combining these results",
    ", we finally find that equation ( [ eq : delta_vs ] ) reduces to @xmath86 while the above expression for @xmath60 seems a bit complicated , this is the exact result for the radial velocity anomaly through relations ( [ eq : def_eta_p ] ) , ( [ eq : x0z0 ] ) and ( [ eq : zeta ] ) in terms of the planet position @xmath87 specified by equation ( [ eq : planet_position ] ) .",
    "to be more realistic , we now take account of the effect of limb darkening , which produces the radial dependence of the intensity of the stellar disk . among the various models proposed so far ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we adopt a linear limb - darkening law as the simplest , but a practically realistic one . introducing the linear limb - darkening coefficient @xmath88 , the stellar intensity",
    "is now given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the vector normal to the local stellar surface : @xmath91 with the limb - darkening effect , however , equation ( [ eq : delta_vs ] ) can no longer be analytically integrated in an exact manner .",
    "therefore , we construct approximate analytic formulae on the basis of the result without limb darkening ( @xmath92 ; see section [ sec : without_darkening ] ) .      applying the analytic results of  [ subsec : phase_a_no_limb ] to the stellar intensity model ( [ eq : i_linearlimb ] ) , equation ( [ eq : delta_vs ] )",
    "is formally rewritten as @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are defined as @xmath96 the above integrals are carried out over the entire planetary disk .",
    "as discussed in appendix [ subsec : w_1_2 ] , they reduce to one - dimensional integrals , which can be expanded with respect to @xmath97 . specifically , equations ( [ appen : approx_w_1 ] ) and ( [ appen : approx_w_2 ] ) show perturbative expressions up to the fourth order in @xmath98 .",
    "the accuracy of the fourth - order perturbation expansion is within a few percent even for @xmath99 ( fig.[fig : integral_w1_w2 ] ) . in practice , however , the value of @xmath98 is expected to be much smaller , @xmath100 . in this case , higher order terms in equations ( [ appen : approx_w_1 ] ) and ( [ appen : approx_w_2 ] ) contribute merely @xmath101% to equation ( [ eq : dv_s_limbdarkening_a ] ) , and one can safely use @xmath102 where @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) .      if the linear limb - darkening effect is taken into account , equation ( [ eq : v_s_ingree / egress ] ) , describing the ingress and egress phases , now becomes @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are defined by @xmath108 appendix [ subsec : w_3_4 ] derives approximate analytic expressions ( [ appen : approx_w_3 ] ) and ( [ appen : approx_w_4 ] ) for equations ( [ eq : w_3 ] ) and ( [ eq : w_4 ] ) , respectively , assuming that @xmath109 .",
    "again , if @xmath100 , they can be safely set as @xmath110 where @xmath111 as shown in figure [ fig : integral_w3_w4 ] , the accuracy of equations ( [ eq : approx_w3 ] ) and ( [ eq : approx_w4 ] ) is typically within a fractional error of @xmath112-@xmath113 percent",
    ". nevertheless , their contribution to the total error budget for the velocity anomaly ( [ eq : dv_s_limbdarkening_b ] ) is within a few percent ( see  [ subsec : num_accuracy ] ) .",
    "thus , equations ( [ eq : approx_w3 ] ) and ( [ eq : approx_w4 ] ) are practically good approximations in most cases .",
    "so far , hd 209458 is the only extrasolar planetary system in which the rm effect is detected ; @xcite reported the first detection of this effect with elodie spectrograph on the 193 cm telescope of the observatoire de haute provence .",
    "they numerically computed the radial velocity anomaly due to the rm effect for a variety of model parameters and compared these with the observed radial curves .",
    "they concluded that @xmath114 and @xmath115  km s@xmath116 , where @xmath61 is the angle between the planet s orbital plane and the star s apparent equatorial plane and @xmath117 denotes the stellar surface velocity .",
    "these are written as @xmath118 and @xmath119 according to the notation of our current paper .",
    "we summarize the current estimates of the stellar and planetary parameters for hd 209458 in table [ tab : planetsystem ] and the best solution for the spin parameters by @xcite in table [ tab : diff_notation ] . since hd 209458 remains the best target for the precise measurement of the rm effect , we consider in this section the extent to which one can improve the constraints on the spin parameters with our analytic formulae .      adopting the linear limb - darkening law for the stellar intensity model , the rm effect for a system in the keplerian orbit",
    "is specified by @xmath120 parameters : the limb - darkening coefficient @xmath88 , the orbital parameters of the system ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath20 , @xmath121 , and @xmath13 ) , the size of the stellar and planetary disks ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) , the projected stellar surface velocity @xmath1 , and the projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the normal direction of the orbital plane @xmath0 . except for the last two parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 )",
    ", these can be independently determined from the usual radial velocity and transiting photometric data , at least in principle .",
    "this is indeed the case for the hd 209458 system ( see table [ tab : planetsystem ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask about the extent to which one can put constraints on the two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 from the radial velocity anomaly during the transit due to the rm effect",
    ".    consider first the sensitivity to the spin parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) .",
    "figures [ fig : radial_veloc_no_limb ] and [ fig : radial_veloc_limb064 ] illustrate our approximations for @xmath60 adopting the estimated parameters of the hd 209458 system ( table [ tab : planetsystem ] ) with and without the stellar limb darkening ( i.e. , @xmath92 and @xmath122 , specifically ) , respectively .",
    "the central transit epoch is chosen as @xmath123",
    ". then ingress starts at @xmath124 hr , the complete transit lasts for @xmath125 hr , and egress ends at @xmath126 hr for @xmath127 ( sometimes these four epochs are referred to as the first , second , third , and fourth contacts , respectively ) .",
    "the range of the spin parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , adopted in these figures roughly covers the uncertainties of the values of @xcite .",
    "comparison of the two figures indicates that the radial velocity anomaly @xmath60 is also sensitive to the linear limb - darkening coefficient @xmath88 .",
    "obviously the amplitude of the radial velocity shift @xmath128 is sensitive to @xmath1 .",
    "the projected angle @xmath0 shifts the zero point of the radial velocity anomaly at earlier ( @xmath129 ) and later ( @xmath130 ) epochs for the orbital inclination @xmath131 .",
    "this produces an asymmetry of the shape of the radial velocity anomaly .",
    "note that the behavior becomes opposite for the inclination @xmath132 , corresponding to the parameter degeneracy between @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "because of the different dependence of the overall radial velocity anomaly on the spin parameters @xmath2 , one can put more stringent constraints on those if our formulae are combined with future precision data attainable by 8  10 m class telescopes with a high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) such as subaru hds .    before addressing this issue in detail ,",
    "it is helpful to clarify the dependence of the rm effect on the other remaining parameters . to investigate this",
    ", we quantify the variation of the radial velocity shift with respect to a specific parameter change @xmath135 by @xmath136 for @xmath137 and @xmath8 . in practice",
    ", we systematically decrease the value of @xmath138 for each parameter down to @xmath139 and ensure the convergence of the derivative . for the angular parameters @xmath140 and @xmath0",
    ", we simply take their scaling values at @xmath141 : @xmath142 here , we confirm the convergence of the derivative by decreasing the value of @xmath143 down to @xmath139 in these cases .",
    "our analytic formulae are indeed useful in evaluating these quantities at the fiducial parameters of the hd 209458 system ( tables [ tab : planetsystem ] and [ tab : diff_notation ] ) . the results are plotted in figure [ fig : parameter_dependence ] as a function of time .",
    "note that our definition of @xmath144 is _ normalized _ by the fractional error in the parameter , i.e. , @xmath138 .",
    "figure [ fig : parameter_dependence ] clearly shows that the stellar radius @xmath64 and the orbital parameters @xmath7 , @xmath20 , and @xmath13 sensitively change the normalized radial velocity variation @xmath144 at the ingress and egress phases , while the spin parameters @xmath145 have a relatively smaller effect on @xmath144 . to quantify the actual deviation of the radial velocity shift caused by the systematic errors in the observation",
    ", we must multiply the observational uncertainty listed in table [ tab : planetsystem ] .",
    "then it turns out that the most sensitive parameter is @xmath1 , causing the @xmath146 m s@xmath116 variation of the radial velocity shift .",
    "the other parameters change the radial velocity shift at the ingress and egress phases by less than @xmath147 m s@xmath116 .",
    "this amplitude itself is comparable to the @xmath144 induced by the uncertainty of the projected angle @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , the different time - dependent effects of the various parameters can be used to break the parameter degeneracy , which would enable an accurate determination of the spin parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in addition , figure [ fig : parameter_dependence ] even suggests that a more precise determination of the orbital parameters other than the spin parameters is also possible by combining the rm effect with the usual radial velocity measurement .",
    "while our analytic formulae presented in the previous section will improve the efficiency of the parameter estimations relative to fully numerical approaches , we have to address a couple of issues before applying them to real data : their accuracy and the effect of the finite exposure time .",
    "our formulae with limb darkening are derived on the basis of an empirical approximation to the integrals of the stellar surface intensity (  [ sec : limb_darkening ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the real data do not instantaneously sample the radial velocity , but are averaged over a finite exposure time .",
    "we directly test those effects against the numerical solutions of equation ( [ eq : delta_vs ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig : differences_eps0 ] and [ fig : differences_eps0.64 ] compare three results : numerical integration of equation ( [ eq : delta_vs ] ) , our analytic formulae , and the numerical average of equation ( [ eq : delta_vs ] ) over a @xmath148 minute exposure time ( in practice , we separately average the denominator and the numerator of the analytic formulae assuming @xmath148 minutes and then take their ratio ) .",
    "these results are labeled a , b , and c and plotted in solid , dotted , and dashed curves , respectively , in the top panels .    for @xmath92 ,",
    "the analytic formulae ( curve b ) are exact , and the completely negligible difference a@xmath149b should be regarded as a welcome check of the accuracy of our numerical integration scheme .",
    "the bottom panels suggest that the three results agree within an accuracy of @xmath150 m s@xmath116 , which is below the typical radial velocity sensitivity achieved ( @xmath151 m s@xmath116 ) and is only comparable to the latest achievement by harps @xcite .",
    "therefore , as far as the hd 209458 system is concerned , we can safely use our analytic formulae as useful templates for the rm effect even if a finite exposure time of the order of 10 minutes is taken into account .",
    "now we are in a position to ask whether our formulae combined with precision spectroscopic data can improve the previous constraints on the spin parameters @xmath152 , among others . for this purpose , we create mock data for the radial velocity anomaly of the hd 209458 system and fit them to the analytic formulae .",
    "basically , the mock data were created adopting the central values of the parameters listed in tables [ tab : planetsystem ] and [ tab : diff_notation ] , but assigned an overall gaussian random error of the rms amplitude @xmath147 m s@xmath116 , which is the level of precision achieved with the subaru hds assuming an exposure time of @xmath148 minutes @xcite . in light of the most recent sensitivity achieved by harps ( @xcite ; @xmath101 m s@xmath116 )",
    ", our error assignment may still be conservative if the error is not dominated by other possible systematic errors . to mimic the effect of the finite exposure time",
    ", we numerically integrate the denominator and the numerator of equation ( [ eq : delta_vs ] ) separately over @xmath148 minutes .",
    "then we take the ratio and assign the random error , as mentioned above .    note that the number of independent data points during the transit phase ( @xmath151 hr including the ingress and egress phases ) is @xmath153 for @xmath148 minutes .",
    "the generated mock data are then fitted to the analytic radial velocity anomaly to estimate the spin parameters . here",
    ", the fitting is performed assuming prior knowledge of the remaining eight parameters .",
    "first , let us see how the spin parameters are reliably estimated from the @xmath154 fit .",
    "to examine this , we create @xmath155 mock realizations and calculate the joint probability distribution of the best - fit parameters under a certain prior knowledge of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath7 .",
    "we use the @xmath154 function , @xmath156 with @xmath157 m s@xmath116 and @xmath158 . in this analysis , according to the result in figure [ fig : parameter_dependence ] , we particularly focus on the five parameters @xmath159 , @xmath0 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath7 .",
    "their input values are @xmath160 m s@xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 au , respectively .",
    "we assume a set of different prior values for @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath7 indicated in each panel of figure [ fig : probdist_best - fit ] and then perform the @xmath154 minimization over @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the results are plotted as contour levels in figure [ fig : probdist_best - fit ] . here",
    ", the two contour curves in each panel represent the 1 and 2 @xmath166 levels of the joint probability . the solid curves plotted along the horizontal and vertical axes are the probability distributions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively , each of which is the projection of the joint probability distribution over the other parameter .",
    "note that in both cases the probability distribution is well approximated by a gaussian distribution with 1 @xmath166 values of @xmath167 m s@xmath116 and @xmath168 .",
    "this result indicates that the estimated value for @xmath1 is rather sensitive to the assumed value of the planetary radius @xmath65 , while @xmath0 can be estimated reliably even if @xmath65 is not known accurately .",
    "this comes from the fact that the velocity shift is roughly proportional to @xmath169 ; however , the projected angle @xmath0 is sensitive only to the asymmetry of the radial velocity shift curve .",
    "another important aspect is that the uncertainty of the prior knowledge of the stellar radius has little effect on the parameter estimation .",
    "the above analysis implies that with a suitably short exposure time , our formulae provide an unbiased estimation of the spin parameters _ statistically _ , if we have reasonably accurate prior knowledge of the other parameters of the system . in reality , however , it may be more relevant to ask about the reliability of the confidence level of the spin parameters derived from _ a single realization _ , rather than from the 50,000 realizations .",
    "this is related to the above analysis statistically , but perhaps it is more appropriate to the situation that one encounters in any observation . for this purpose ,",
    "we randomly select one from the 50,000 realizations and compute 1 and 2 @xmath166 confidence contours from the _ relative _ confidence levels , @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are the best - fit values .",

    "the corresponding radial velocity curves are depicted in figure [ fig : demos ] , together with both the best - fit and the true curves ( _ solid and dashed curves , respectively _ ) .",
    "basically , figure [ fig : delta_chi^2_contour ] demonstrates that the spin parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be constrained around the best - fit values with the 1 @xmath166 errors of @xmath173 m s@xmath116 and @xmath174 , which greatly improves the uncertainties ( by a factor of 4 ) relative to the previous result by ( * ? ? ?",

    "we have discussed a methodology to estimate the stellar spin angular velocity and its direction angle with respect to the planetary orbit for transiting extrasolar planetary systems using the rm effect previously known in eclipsing binary stars @xcite . in particular",
    "we have derived analytic expressions of the radial velocity anomaly , @xmath60 , which are sufficiently accurate for extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "if the stellar limb darkening is neglected , the expression is exact .",
    "we have extended the result to the case with limb darkening and obtained approximate but accurate analytic formulae . for a typical value of @xmath175",
    ", the formulae reduce to a simple form ( eqs.[[eq : dv_s_limbdarkening_a ] ] , [ [ eq : approx_w1 ] ] , [ [ eq : approx_w2 ] ] , [ [ eq : dv_s_limbdarkening_b ] ] , [ [ eq : approx_w3 ] ] , and [ [ eq : approx_w4 ] ] ) : @xmath176 during the complete transit phase and @xmath177 during the egress / ingress phases , where @xmath178 where @xmath179 is defined in equation ( [ appen : func_g ] ) . the definition and the meaning of the variables in the above expressions",
    "are summarized in table [ tab : notation ] .",
    "the numerical accuracy of the above formulae was checked using a specific example of the transiting extrasolar planetary system , hd 209458 , and we found that they are accurate within a few percent .",
    "our analytic formulae for the radial velocity anomaly are useful in several ways .",
    "one can estimate the planetary parameters much more efficiently and easily , since one does not have to resort to computationally demanding numerical modeling .",
    "furthermore , the resulting uncertainties of the fitted parameters and their correlations are easily evaluated . to illustrate these advantages",
    "specifically , we performed a parameter estimation applying the formulae against mock data for hd 209458 .",
    "we showed that with precision data obtainable by 810 m class telescopes such as subaru hds , our formulae improve the efficiency and robustness of estimating the spin parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the combined data analysis with asteroseismology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or the correlation between the mean level of emission and the rotation period ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may break the degeneracy between @xmath117 and @xmath180 in extrasolar planetary systems .    among the recently discovered transiting extrasolar planetary systems ,",
    "i.e. , tres-1 by the trans - atlantic exoplanet survey @xcite and ogle - tr 10 , 56 , 111 , 113 , 132 by the optically gravitational lens event survey ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , tres-1 has similar orbital period and mass to those of hd 209458b , but its radius is smaller .",
    "thus , it is an interesting target to determine the spin parameters via the rm effect ; if its planetary orbit and the stellar rotation share the same direction as discovered for the hd 209458 system , it would be an important confirmation of the current view of planet formation out of the protoplanetary disk surrounding the protostar . if not , the result would be more exciting and even challenge the standard view , depending on the value of the misalignment angle @xmath0 .",
    "we also note that the future satellites _ corot _ and _ kepler _ will detect numerous transiting planetary systems , most of which will be important targets for the rm effect in 8 - 10 m class ground - based telescopes .",
    "we hope that our analytic formulae presented here will be a useful template in estimating parameters for those stellar and planetary systems .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that the rm effect may even be used as yet another new detection method of transiting planetary systems . for the hd 209458 system , the stellar radial velocity amplitude due to the kepler motion is around 100 m s@xmath161 . since the stellar rotation velocity is around 4 km s@xmath161 , the maximum radial velocity anomaly due to the rm effect is @xmath181 m s@xmath161 and thus is very close to the former . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter could be significantly larger if the host star rotates faster , and/or the host star ( the planet ) has a smaller ( larger ) radius . in extreme cases , the radial velocity curve , with a periodicity of a few days for instance , is barely detectable , but the velocity anomaly is quite visible for a few hours of the transiting phase .",
    "thus , the conventional radial velocity curve analysis might have missed some of the potentially interesting spectroscopic signature of transiting planets .",
    "a search for such specific signatures deserves an attempt against existing or future spectroscopic samples that do not show any clear conventional feature of radial velocity periodicity .    in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated that the radial velocity anomaly due to the rm effect provides a reliable estimation of spin parameters . combining data with the analytic formulae for radial velocity shift @xmath60",
    ", this methodology becomes a powerful tool in extracting information on the formation and the evolution of extrasolar planetary systems , especially the origin of their angular momentum .",
    "although it is unlikely , we may even speculate that a future rm observation may discover an extrasolar planetary system in which the stellar spin and the planetary orbital axes are antiparallel or orthogonal .",
    "this would have a great impact on the planetary formation scenario , which would have to invoke an additional effect from possible other planets in the system during the migration or the capture of a free - floating planet . while it is premature to discuss such extreme possibilities at this point ,",
    "the observational exploration of transiting systems using the rm effect is one of the most important probes for a better understanding of the origin of extrasolar planets .",
