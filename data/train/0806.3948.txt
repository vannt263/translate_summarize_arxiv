    "the possibility to achieve very low temperatures and the feasibility in the laboratory of implementing optical lattices represent the proper arena where testing the validity of certain condensed - matter theories and observing the manifestations of effects related to quantum mechanical statistics . within the interesting sinergy between quantum atom optics and condensed matter physics , recent trends are study of the superfluid to mott - insulator phase transition in bosonic systems , ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , and the striving for the realization of a bcs - type condensate in a fermionic system ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "when atomic systems made up of bosons and fermions are considered , a very rich scenario opens up ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , bose - fermi mixtures sympathetically cooled into their quantum degenerate states ( @xcite and @xcite ) exhibit a strong tendency towards phase separation ( @xcite and @xcite ) , demixing of the bosons and the fermions , and supersolid ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . recently",
    ", these issues were addressed in @xcite , where spinless bosons and spin - polarized fermions confined in two dimensional ( @xmath0d ) periodic geometries were taken into account .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the effective interaction between the bosons of the mixture plays a crucial role to the end of determining the boundaries between the various phases of the system . +",
    "the dynamics underlying phase separation is driven by a small change ( @xmath1 ) in the bosonic density , which produces a modulation ( @xmath2 ) of the fermionic density , related to @xmath1 by @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the on - site boson - fermion interaction amplitude , and @xmath5 the density of states at the fermi energy @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "as consequence of the feedback of the fermionic distortion @xmath2 , a shift of the bosonic energy @xmath7 occurs , thereby inducing an attraction between the bosons with strength @xmath8 .",
    "phase separation emerges when the induced attraction and the intrinsic repulsion between the bosons have the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "+ one of the peculiarities of optical lattices is their periodic arrangement , that is the same of the crystal structure of a solid .",
    "the phenomelogical interpretation of particle localization at fixed sites at the base of mott - insulator mechanism is related just to the crystalline structure . in supersolid ,",
    "such a structure is combined with the essence of a superfluid , i.e. stiffnes allowing for particles current to flow without dissipation .",
    "+ in general to supersolids are associated two kinds of order , which usually appear in mutual competition .",
    "these are the diagonal long - range order ( dlro ) associated with the periodic density modulation in a crystal , and the off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) associated with the phase order in the condensate @xcite . in the strongly interacting case , as in @xmath9he systems , ( @xcite and @xcite ) , supersolids have been proposed to exist and analyzed numerically in various model systems describing interacting bosons on a lattice @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we consider mixtures of spinless bosons and not spin - polarized fermions , so that a non zero @xmath10-wave interaction between fermions on the same site emerges .",
    "the goal of the present work is analyzing the effects of such an interaction on phase diagrams of the system . approaching the problem within the linear response theory framework @xcite",
    ", we show that it is possible to calculate in explicit way an effective boson - boson interaction also when the on - site fermion - fermion interaction is taken into account .",
    "+ the basic idea relies on sharing tasks between the fermions and the bosons . in particular ,",
    "the fermions are tuned through a density wave instability establishing crystalline order ( dlro ) , while the bosons provide the off - diagonal long range order ( odlro ) .",
    "the interaction between bosons and fermions , and the interaction between the fermions , produce an additional density modulation also in the bosonic density field , hence resulting in a ss phase . to triggering a density wave ( dw ) instability in the fermions ,",
    "the mixed boson - fermion system is confined to two dimensions and loaded in an optical lattice providing perfect fermi surface nesting at half - filling @xcite .",
    "+ the supersolid transition triggered by the fermions competes with an instability towards phase separation in the boson system . because of the dimensionality and the lattice geometry of our system , the presence of van hove singularities ( @xcite and @xcite ) -well studied in bcs superconductivity @xcite- strongly enhances the tendency towards phase separation and produces new and interesting features in this transition : an arbitrary weak interaction between the bosons and the fermions , and between fermions , is sufficient to drive the phase separation at low temperatures . in the following ,",
    "we investigate the instabilities towards phase separation and density wave formation .",
    "we focus on the weak coupling limit between the bosons and the fermions and between fermions , which excludes a demixing in a repulsive bose - fermi system along the lines discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ the organization of paper is as follows . in the section",
    "ii , we set the notation , and derive the model hamiltonian . in the third section",
    ", we display the novel result consisting in the analytic formula for the effective boson - boson interaction as a function of the temperature , and discuss the competition between ps and ss ; we derive the phase separation and density - wave transition temperatures . in the last section ,",
    "we write down our conclusions and comment about future perspectives of the topic .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian for interacting spinless bosons and not spin - polarized fermionic atoms subject to an optical lattice reads @xmath11 ( here and in the following , @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the atomic species and the spin , respectively ) @xcite @xmath14 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we assume a repulsive interaction between the bosons : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is associated the @xmath10-wave scattering length . the boson - fermion interaction strength @xmath17 is assumed to be the same for both the spin configurations ; here , @xmath18 is the boson - fermion @xmath10-wave scattering length and @xmath19 is the reduced mass .",
