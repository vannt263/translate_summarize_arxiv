    "hadronic nuclei are useful tools for studying hadron - nucleon interactions and in - medium properties of hadrons .",
    "the recent interest in kaonic nuclei was motivated by the strongly attractive antikaon - nucleus density - dependent optical potentials obtained from @xmath8 atomic data fits  @xcite .",
    "akaishi and yamazaki  @xcite using g - matrix one - channel @xmath7 interactions , predicted the existence of deep and narrow @xmath8 bound states in @xmath9he , @xmath10he , and @xmath11be .",
    "of particular interest is the lightest possible antikaon - nucleus system , @xmath12 , for which these authors calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite values of 48 mev and 61 mev for the total binding energy and the decay width , respectively .",
    "deeply bound kaonic states were searched in @xmath13he@xmath14 reactions at kek , with negative results so far  @xcite , and by the finuda spectrometer collaboration at da@xmath15ne  @xcite in stopped @xmath8 reactions on nuclear targets such as lithium and carbon .",
    "the latter experiment suggested evidence for a bound state @xmath12 ` observed ' through its decay into approximately back - to - back @xmath16-proton pairs .",
    "the deduced binding energy ( 115 mev ) , but not the width ( 67 mev ) , differs considerably from the theoretical prediction of ref .",
    "however , this interpretation of the measured @xmath16-proton spectrum in the finuda experiment was challenged by magas _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who also criticized the yamazaki - akaishi calculations  @xcite for using an effective @xmath17 optical potential in lieu of genuine @xmath18 interactions .",
    "the near - threshold @xmath7 interaction is mainly affected by the sub - threshold @xmath19 resonance @xmath20 , which is usually assumed a @xmath7 bound state and a resonance in the @xmath21 channel .",
    "numerous theoretical works were devoted to constructing @xmath7 interactions within k - matrix models , dispersion relations , meson - exchange models , quark models , cloudy bag - models , and more recently by applying su(3 ) meson - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( see e.g. the recent review papers  @xcite ) . scattering experiments for @xmath22 are rather old and the data are not too accurate .",
    "kaonic hydrogen provides additional information .",
    "namely , there are two experimental measurements of the @xmath23 level shift and width caused by the strong interaction , performed at kek  @xcite and recently by the dear collaboration at da@xmath15ne , frascati  @xcite",
    ". the measured upward shift appears as due to a repulsive strong interaction , but in fact it is caused by an attractive interaction in the @xmath19 @xmath24 channel , which is strong enough to generate a quasi - bound strong - interaction state .",
    "the effect of such a strong attractive interaction is to push the purely coulomb level upwards . using the deser formula  @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to obtain the @xmath22 scattering length from the value of the @xmath23 level energy shift .",
    "unfortunately , several recent theoretical models could not simultaneously reproduce the dear value of the @xmath22 scattering length together with the bulk of @xmath25 scattering data  @xcite .    as should be clear from this brief introduction , the fields of @xmath7 and @xmath17nucleus interaction are abundant with open questions and problems .",
    "the elucidation of @xmath17 nuclear properties would help considerably to derive significant information on the in - medium @xmath7 interaction and on the possibility of kaon condensation in dense nuclear matter , see refs .",
    "@xcite and previous works cited therein .",
    "among @xmath17 nuclear systems , the study of three - body ` exotic ' systems offers the advantage that faddeev equations  @xcite , which exactly describe the dynamics of few particles , provide a proper theoretical and computational framework . in the present work , we have generalized the faddeev equations in the alt - grassberger - sandhas form  @xcite in order to include additional ` particle ' channels and thus performed the first genuinely three - body @xmath26 coupled - channel faddeev calculation in search for quasi - bound states in the @xmath12 system .",
    "a preliminary report of this work was given in ref .",
    "the present paper provides a more detailed and complete version of the previous one , especially concerning the dependence of the three - body results on the two - body input .",
    "the main result of ref .",
    "@xcite is reconfirmed , namely that a single @xmath27 @xmath28 quasi - bound state exists with binding energy @xmath29  mev and width @xmath30  mev .",
    "it is shown that ` equivalent ' single - channel @xmath31 calculations of the type reported by yamazaki and akaishi  @xcite underestimate considerably the binding energy , and particularly the width resulting within the full @xmath26 coupled - channel calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the derivation of the coupled - channel faddeev equations in the ags form .",
    "the two - body potentials which enter these equations are described in section iii .",
    "results are given in section iv for the full coupled - channel calculations , along with suitably chosen single - channel calculations that could provide a testground for comparison with the single - channel calculation of ref .",
    "conclusions are given in section v.",
    "three - body faddeev equations  @xcite in the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) form  @xcite @xmath32 define unknown operators @xmath33 , describing the elastic and re - arrangement processes @xmath34 .",
    "the inputs for the ags system of equations  ( [ ags ] ) are two - body @xmath35-matrices , immersed into three - body space .",
    "the operator @xmath36 is the free three - body green s function .",
    "faddeev partition indices @xmath37 denote simultaneously an interacting pair and a spectator particle . when the initial state is known , as is usually assumed , the system  ( [ ags ] ) consists of three equations .",
    "the ags equations are quantum - mechanical ones , describing processes in which the number and composition of particles are fixed . however , the two - body @xmath7 interaction , which is essential for the @xmath38 quasi - bound state calculation , is strongly coupled to other channels , particulary to the @xmath39 channel via @xmath20 . to take the @xmath4 coupling directly into account ( we neglect the weaker coupled @xmath40 @xmath41 channel )",
    ", it is necessary to extend the formalism of faddeev equations . to this end",
    "it is assumed that in addition to the usual faddeev channels , which represent different partitions of the same set of particles , there are also ` particle ' channels .",
    "each of the three ` particle ' channels consists of three usual faddeev partitions ( here we treat the two nucleons as distinguishable particles , with proper antisymmetrization introduced at a later stage ) .",
    "thus , all three - body operators will have ` particle ' indices ( @xmath42 ) for each state in addition to the usual faddeev indices ( @xmath43 ) , see table  [ channels.tab ] .    .interacting two - body subsystems for three partition ( @xmath43 ) and three ` particle ' channel ( @xmath42 ) indices",
    "the interactions are further labelled by the two - body isospin values , entering the ags equations with total three - body isospin @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another test calculation was performed with a one - channel complex @xmath7 potential .",
    "the strength parameters @xmath44 of the potential were fitted to the @xmath45 and @xmath46 data , and the dependence of the three - body pole on the range parameter @xmath47 was investigated .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ diff_betas_cmplxkn.fig ] .",
    "it is seen from the plot that increasing the range of the @xmath7 interaction , by decreasing the range parameter @xmath47 , gives rise to a deeper and somewhat narrower three - body level . the dependence of the calculated @xmath2 energy on the range parameter @xmath47 , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ diff_betas_cmplxkn.fig ] , is rather strong .",
    "therefore , using a too large or a too small range parameter for the complex @xmath7 interaction leads to substantial underestimate or overestimate , respectively , of the three - body energy .",
    "the ` best set ' of @xmath7 parameters with a fixed value for the range parameter , @xmath48  @xmath49 , yields the three - body pole energy @xmath50 shown in the second column of table  [ e_complex.tab ] .",
    "the result of the full coupled - channel calculation @xmath51 is shown in the third column .",
    "the transition within a three - body single - channel @xmath2 calculation from using a real @xmath7 interaction to using the complex @xmath7 interaction , fitted to @xmath46 and to @xmath45 , is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ epsilonkn_cmplxkn.fig ] by the trajectory of complex three - body energies starting with the real @xmath52 at the upper - left corner and ending with the complex @xmath50 at the lower - right corner .",
    "this trajectory is generated by varying a real parameter @xmath53 between 0 to 1 , @xmath54 for @xmath52 and @xmath55 for @xmath50 , such that the imaginary parts of the fitted @xmath46 and @xmath45 are scaled down by @xmath53 : @xmath56    it is interesting to note that although the @xmath19 and @xmath40 strength parameters @xmath57 provide stronger attraction in the @xmath7 systems than the attraction provided by @xmath58 , yet @xmath59 signifies less binding than @xmath60 .",
    "this generalizes the well known property in two - body problems where including absorptivity leads effectively to adding repulsion . here",
    "we find that absorption of flux from the @xmath7 channel into other unspecified channels represented by an imaginary part of a complex @xmath7 potential reduces also the three - body binding energy .",
    "comparing the result of the one - channel complex @xmath2 calculation with the coupled - channel @xmath2 ( see table  [ e_complex.tab ] ) shows that @xmath61 is much deeper and broader than @xmath59 .",
    "this means that the @xmath21 channel , within a genuinely three - body coupled - channel calculation plays an important dynamical role in forming the three - body resonance ( quasi - bound state ) , over its obvious role of absorbing flux from the @xmath7 channel .",
    "the poor applicability of an optical potential approach ( or some low - order perturbation calculation ) in searching for a quasi - bound state was shown , for example , by ueda  @xcite , who studied the @xmath62 coupled - channel system using faddeev equations , finding a large deviation of the calculated results from optical - model predictions .",
    "in order to compare the present results with the results of calculations by yamazaki and akaishi  @xcite , the one - channel @xmath2 calculation was repeated using the complex @xmath7 potential corresponding to the ` ay set ' of @xmath7 parameters .",
    "the result obtained by us ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 from ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in the last two columns of table  [ e_complex.tab ] .",
    "it is remarkable that in spite of different forms of the two - body potentials and different three - body formalisms , the calculated three - body energies in these single - channel @xmath2 calculations come out very close to each other , provided the same set of @xmath7 parameters is fitted to . nevertheless , both values of three - body energy are far away from the three - body energy of the complete coupled - channel calculation .",
    "one of the reasons is the use of a complex @xmath7 potential in the single - channel @xmath2 calculations , another reason is the too small value , @xmath65  @xmath49 , for the range parameter used in these approximate calculations .",
    "we performed coupled - channel few - body calculations of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xmath2 system , finding a deeply bound and broad quasi - bound state , which is a resonance in the @xmath66 channel .",
    "the calculations yielded binding energy @xmath5  mev and width @xmath67  mev , in agreement with our earlier results  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the explicit inclusion of the second channel is crucial for this system .",
    "the dependence of the three - body energy pole on different forms and parameters of the @xmath7 interaction , and on different ways of reproducing @xmath24 observables , was studied .",
    "most of these dependencies were found to be strong . in particular , it was shown that a complex @xmath7 potential gives much shallower and narrower three - body quasi - bound state than the full coupled - channel calculation , which has the same range parameter and reproduces the same @xmath24 observables .",
    "we compared our results with those of yamazaki and akaishi  @xcite , demonstrating the shortcomings of these single - channel @xmath2 calculations .",
    "two more calculations of the same system appeared recently .",
    "dote and weise  @xcite have presented preliminary results of a variational anitsymmetrized molecular dynamics calculation for the @xmath38 system within a single - channel @xmath2 framework .",
    "their calculation focuses attention to the dependence of the calculated real three - body binding energy on the range parameter of the gaussian @xmath7 interaction used .",
    "it includes perturbatively also a @xmath68-wave @xmath7 interaction . whereas a direct comparison between our coupled - channel calculations and these single - channel calculations",
    "can not be made , the general criticism expressed above of the use of a single - channel formalism applies also to this work .",
    "a coupled - channel @xmath69 calculation of the same @xmath38 system was performed recently by ikeda and sato  @xcite with less emphasis on reproducing low - energy @xmath7 data .",
    "the obtained binding energies are in a similar range to those presented here , while the widths are consistently lower than those calculated in the present work .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that all the theoretical calculations discussed above , including the present calculations , obtain binding energies which are considerably below the binding energy @xmath70  mev deduced for the @xmath27 identification proposed in ref .",
    "this finuda @xmath71 experiment on lithium and heavier targets , as mentioned in the introduction , leaves room for other interpretations as well .",
    "the use of a more restrictive @xmath72he target in order to search for a @xmath27 quasibound state in a ( @xmath73 ) reaction was approved as a ` day-1 ' experiment in j - parc @xcite .",
    "the spectrum calculated recently for this reaction @xcite demonstrates how the large width predicted for @xmath27 in the present work is expected to wipe out any clear peak structure in this reaction .",
    "additional calculations are necessary to study other features of the coupled @xmath2 system .",
    "these include the secondary effect of the @xmath41 channel beyond that of the primary inelastic @xmath21 channel incorporated here , of @xmath68-wave @xmath7 and @xmath74 interactions , and the use of relativistic kinematics .",
    "finally , in order to understand better the @xmath7 interaction , it is desirable to perform coupled - channel faddeev calculations of a quasi - bound state in the @xmath75 @xmath2 system as well .",
