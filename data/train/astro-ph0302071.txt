    "rich information on neutrino properties , oscillations , the supernova mechanism , and very dense matter is contained in the neutrinos from core - collapse supernovae@xcite .",
    "existing detectors such as super - kamiokande@xcite should accurately measure the @xmath5 component of the supernova signal .",
    "however the very interesting @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ( collectively @xmath8 ) components may be detected without direct energy information and or in the presence of significant backgrounds from other neutrino induced reactions .",
    "therefore , additional @xmath8 detectors could be very useful .",
    "perhaps the  ultimate \" supernova detector involves neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering @xcite . the count rate in such a detector could be very high because the coherent elastic cross section is large and all six neutrino components ( @xmath9,@xmath5 , and the four @xmath8 ) contribute to the signal .",
    "in particular , the detector is sensitive to @xmath8 , which are expected to have a high energy and large cross section .",
    "elastic scattering detectors can have yields of a few or more @xmath8 events _ per ton _ for a supernova at 10 kpc ( @xmath10 m ) .",
    "this is an increase by a factor of 20 or more over existing light - water detector yields of hundreds of @xmath5 and tens of @xmath8 events _ per kiloton_.    furthermore , the energy of nuclear recoils provides direct information on the @xmath8 spectrum .",
    "existing detectors measure @xmath8 via neutral - current inelastic reactions on oxygen@xcite , deuterium @xcite , or carbon @xcite . here",
    "the observed energy deposition does not depend on the neutrino energy as long as it is above threshold .",
    "perhaps neutrino - proton elastic scattering@xcite can be detected in kamland@xcite .",
    "this is similar to neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering but has a smaller cross section .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible to detect @xmath8 using inelastic excitations of pb .",
    "proposals include using lead perchlorate , as suggested by elliott@xcite , omnis @xcite and land @xcite . here",
    "some information on @xmath8 energies may be obtained by measuring the ratio of single- to two - neutron knockout .",
    "however , the inelastic pb cross sections are somewhat uncertain . in contrast , neutrino - nucleus elastic cross sections can be calculated accurately with very little theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath8 spectrum depends on how neutrinos thermalize with matter in a supernova , and is somewhat uncertain .",
    "keil , raffelt , and janka have studied the effects of nn bremsstrahlung , pair annihilation , and nucleon recoil on the @xmath8 spectrum @xcite .",
    "these effects can be measured with an elastic - scattering detector .",
    "obtaining direct information on @xmath8 energies may be very important because the difference in energies for @xmath8 compared to @xmath9 or @xmath5 is the primary lever arm for observing neutrino oscillations .",
    "for example , @xmath11 oscillations could lead to high - energy @xmath9 .",
    "however , deducing the oscillation probability may depend crucially on knowing how hot the @xmath8 were to begin with .",
    "neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering itself is  flavor blind \" .",
    "therefore , the signal should be independent of neutrino oscillations ( among active species ) .",
    "thus elastic scattering may provide a baseline with which to characterize the supernova source .",
    "comparing this information to other flavor - dependent information and theoretical simulations may provide the best evidence of oscillations .",
    "the kinetic energy of the recoiling nuclei is low , typically below 100 kev .",
    "it is difficult to detect such low - energy events in the presence of radioactive backgrounds .",
    "furthermore , scintillation signals from the nuclear recoils may be reduced by quenching because of the very high ionization density .",
    "however , recent progress in designing detectors for low - energy solar neutrinos suggests that detection may be feasible",
    ". in general , backgrounds for solar neutrinos with a low count - rate signal may be more severe than those for a supernova , where all of the events are concentrated in a few - second interval .    cryogenic low energy astrophysics with noble gases ( clean )",
    "is a proposed detector for low - energy solar neutrinos based on scintillation in an ultrapure cryogenic liquid@xcite .",
    "this will detect electrons from neutrino - electron scattering at energies comparable to the recoil energy of nuclei from supernova neutrinos . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the utility of clean for supernovae detection via neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering .",
    "there is considerable interest in the direct detection of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "these are expected to produce recoiling nuclei with a spectrum somewhat similar@xcite to that of supernova neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering .",
    "again , backgrounds for wimp detection may be larger than for supernovae because of the low wimp count rates .",
    "present wimp detectors , for example cdms@xcite , have small target masses .",
    "however , future detectors may be larger .",
    "it is important to search for neutrinoless double - beta decay , as this can distinguish dirac from majorana neutrinos .",
    "existing @xmath12ge experiments use multikilogram masses @xcite .",
    "the next - generation experiments such as majorana @xcite or genius @xcite may employ up to a ton of ge . the need for good energy resolution , to tell neutrinoless from two - neutrino double - beta decay , often aids in the detection of low - energy recoils .",
    "we calculate that the largest double - beta decay experiments may soon be sensitive to galactic supernovae via elastic scattering .",
    "finally , micropattern gas detectors @xcite may have a threshold low enough to detect nuclear recoils .",
    "this may allow the observation of neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering using reactor antineutrinos .",
    "thus the technical requirements for detecting low - energy solar neutrinos , wimps , double - beta decay , and supernovae via nuclear - elastic scattering may be similar .",
    "one detector or approach for low - threshold , low - background , large mass measurements may have applications in multiple areas including supernova detection via neutrino - nucleus scattering .    in section",
    "ii , we fold elastic scattering cross sections with a model supernova neutrino spectrum to produce recoil spectra and yields .",
    "we consider a range of noble - gas targets from @xmath3he to @xmath13xe along with @xmath14c , @xmath15si , @xmath12ge , @xmath16cd , @xmath17te , and @xmath4pb .",
    "we also discuss extrapolating yields to nearby isotopes .",
    "section iii focuses on the liquid - ne - based clean detector , which appears to be very promising .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of backgrounds in clean is presented and compared to the expected supernova signal .",
    "we discuss the large signal - to - background ratio , choice of fiducial volume , and possible detector thresholds .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "the neutrino - nucleus elastic - scattering cross section @xmath18 is @xcite , @xmath19 for a neutrino of energy @xmath20 scattering at angle @xmath21 .",
    "the fermi constant is @xmath22 .",
    "this coherent cross section depends on the square of the weak charge @xmath23 @xmath24 of a nucleus with @xmath25 neutrons and @xmath26 protons .",
    "the weak mixing angle is sin@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we assume a spin - zero target .",
    "finally , the ground - state elastic form factor @xmath28 at momentum transfer @xmath29 , @xmath30 is @xmath31.\\ ] ] here @xmath32 is the neutron density and @xmath33 is the proton density .",
    "the form factor is normalized @xmath34 .",
    "we neglect a small correction from the single - nucleon form factors .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath28 is crucial for heavier targets .",
    "however , we evaluate it at relatively small @xmath35 so the exact form of the densities is not important .",
    "the proton density is often well constrained by measured charge densities .",
    "for simplicity we use theoretical densities from simple relativistic - mean - field calculations using the successful nl3 effective interaction @xcite .",
    "these calculations assume spherical ground states and do not include pairing corrections .",
    "the use of other densities is not expected to change our results significantly .",
    "we now consider a simple  standard model \" for the supernova - neutrino spectra , see for example @xcite .",
    "this model is close to what others have used . a total energy of @xmath36 ergs ( 1 erg @xmath37 j )",
    "is assumed to be radiated in neutrinos from a supernova at a distance @xmath38 of 10 kpc ( @xmath10 m ) . for simplicity",
    "we use boltzmann spectra at temperatures of @xmath39 , 5 and 8 mev for the @xmath9 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 components respectively . here",
    "@xmath40 is the boltzmann constant , which we set to one in the rest of the paper .",
    "the use of fermi dirac spectra ( at zero chemical potential ) should give similar results .",
    "however , neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering is sensitive to the high - energy tails in the spectra .",
    "therefore non thermal spectra could modify our results somewhat and should be investigated in future work .",
    "we assume equal partition in energy among the @xmath9 @xmath5 and the four @xmath8 components .",
    "therefore this standard supernova radiates a total of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 neutrinos .",
    "the time integral of the neutrino flux at earth @xmath44 for a neutrino of energy @xmath20 is @xmath45 for @xmath46 , or @xmath8 .    microscopic simulations of supernovae suggest that equal partition of energy may be good only to @xmath47 25 % .",
    "furthermore , there is important uncertainty in the @xmath8 spectrum , with estimates of @xmath48 ranging from @xmath49 to 8 mev .",
    "it is an important goal of elastic - scattering detectors to measure @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the predictions of our supernova spectrum have significant uncertainties",
    ". nevertheless , this simple model should provide order - of - magnitude estimates and may allow easy comparisons to other calculations .    the yield of recoiling nuclei with energy @xmath50 and mass @xmath51 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total number of target atoms . for our boltzmann spectra",
    "this integral is simple : @xmath54 with @xmath55 . for large recoil energy @xmath50 , @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath57 for light nuclei the high - energy tail continues to hundreds of kev and is produced by the scattering of very - high - energy @xmath8 .",
    "however , for heavier nuclei the tail is sharply reduced by the nuclear form factor .",
    "we consider first noble - liquid detectors from @xmath3he to @xmath13xe and then a range of other detectors in order of increasing mass number @xmath58 from @xmath14c to @xmath4pb .",
    "the yield @xmath56 from eq .",
    "( [ yield ] ) is shown in figure 1 for detectors made of @xmath3he , @xmath59ne , @xmath60ar , @xmath61kr , and @xmath13xe .",
    "we do nt mean to imply that detectors would be feasible with all of these liquids .",
    "however , we show these nuclei to illustrate how the yield depends on @xmath58 for a broad range of @xmath58 .",
    "the spectra in figure 1 are peaked at low recoil energy @xmath50 .",
    "increasing @xmath58 raises the cross section because coherent scattering is proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "thus at low energies @xmath56 increases significantly with @xmath58 .",
    "however , as @xmath58 increases the spectrum is strongly shifted to lower energies by the form factor and the large target mass .",
    "the energy integral of @xmath56 , or total yield , is given in table i in events per ton of detector .",
    "also listed are events above a threshold of 5 , 10 , 25 , or 50 kev .",
    "finally , the average recoil energy of the nuclei is given .",
    "this average is influenced by a small number of events at high energies , while the spectrum is peaked at low energies .",
    "the optimal choice of @xmath58 may involve a trade - off between cross section , which favors high @xmath58 , and recoil energy , which favors small @xmath58 .",
    "this choice may depend on the attainable threshold .",
    "furthermore , the choice of target material depends on a host of other practical considerations including the presence of possible backgrounds from radioactive isotopes .",
    "although @xmath3he has a relatively small cross section it has high recoil energies .",
    "we find a total yield in table i of 0.85 events per ton .",
    "helium - based solar - neutrino detectors include heron @xcite and tpc @xcite ( or hellaz @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps nuclei near @xmath63 give a reasonable balance between cross section and recoil energy .",
    "however , ar may have backgrounds from radioactive @xmath64ar and @xmath65ar , while kr may have backgrounds from @xmath66kr .",
    "xenon is being used in several dark - matter , double - beta decay and solar - neutrino detectors including xmass @xcite , xenon @xcite and zeplin@xcite .",
    "the total yield is very large , 31 events per ton .",
    "however , because @xmath13xe is heavy , there is a strong premium on obtaining a low threshold .",
    "background from the @xmath67 double - beta decay of @xmath68xe should not be a problem for a supernova detector .    above a threshold of 25",
    "kev the yield is a relatively slow function of @xmath58 .",
    "therefore one may have considerable freedom in the choice of target material .",
    "we consider the clean liquid - ne solar - neutrino detector @xcite at some length .",
    "the total yield of 3.99 events per ton is dominated by 3.08 @xmath8 events with only 0.38 @xmath9 and 0.53 @xmath5 events .",
    "one is very sensitive to the @xmath8 spectrum .",
    "for example , if the @xmath8 temperature is not the expected 8 mev but instead is near that for @xmath5 @xmath69 mev , the spectrum in figure 1 is greatly changed .",
    "this verifies that the recoil spectrum contains direct information on the @xmath8 energies . a monte carlo simulation of backgrounds in clean is presented in section iii .",
    "we now consider a number of other targets .",
    "detectors based on organic scintillator such as borexino and kamland @xcite have a yield of 2.50 events per ton of @xmath14c , see table i. with any carbon - based detector there will be backgrounds from @xmath70c .",
    "borexino should have a ratio @xmath70c/ @xmath14c of the order @xmath71 @xcite . at a concentration of @xmath71",
    "there will be about 2 @xmath70c decays per ton during the 10 seconds of a supernova neutrino burst .",
    "this is comparable to the number of elastic recoils .",
    "however , the @xmath70c background should have a different spectrum and can be well measured at other times .",
    "therefore , this background may not prevent the use of carbon as a supernova detector , even if it does prevent the observation of pp solar neutrinos .",
    "quenching may be a serious problem for organic scintillator .",
    "the amount of light produced from recoiling c ions may be much less than that for recoiling electrons @xcite .",
    "an organic scintillator will also have events from neutrino - proton elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "we estimate a yield of about 0.33 events per ton of ch@xmath72 . because of the light proton mass these events will have a larger recoil energy .",
    "the proton elastic - scattering cross section has a theoretical uncertainty of 10 to 20 % from possible strange quark contributions to the nucleon s axial current and spin@xcite",
    ". it would be very useful to have better laboratory measurements of neutrino - proton elastic scattering .",
    "in contrast , strange quarks are not expected to make significant contributions for supernova neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering .",
    "indeed , there is almost no theoretical uncertainty in the neutrino - nucleus elastic cross sections .",
    "silicon detectors such as those described in @xcite have a yield of 5.5 events per ton and the recoil spectrum is shown in figure 2 , while @xmath12ge detectors have a yield of 18.6 events per ton and an average recoil energy of 9.5 kev .",
    "the double - beta decay experiment majorana @xcite is proposed to have a 500 kg mass , while genius @xcite has a proposed mass of one ton .",
    "these detectors should have very low backgrounds and low thresholds .",
    "therefore they should be sensitive to a supernova at 10 kpc .",
    "it is remarkable that such small target masses can yield statistics for our own galaxy comparable to those for the historic imb and kamiokande signals from sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "finally , @xmath16cd , @xmath17te and @xmath4pb yields are listed in table i. the yield and spectrum for @xmath17te is very close to @xmath13xe ( see figures 1 and 2 ) since they both have 78 neutrons .",
    "the heavy nucleus @xmath4pb has a very large yield of 47.5 events per ton .",
    "however , the average recoil energy is only 2.6 kev .",
    "backgrounds and the need for a very low threshold may make a pb detector very difficult to build .",
    "the nuclei in figures 1 and 2 display a range of recoil spectra . for point nuclei",
    "there would be a single universal spectral shape , with the recoil energy decreasing and the yield increasing with increasing @xmath58 .",
    "however , the different nuclear form factors modify the spectra for heavy nuclei .",
    "finally , we provide a simple formula to extrapolate the yields in table i to nearby isotopes .",
    "if one ignores small changes in the form factors of nearby nuclei , then the yield will be approximately proportional to the square of an effective weak charge , @xmath73 , @xmath74 with @xmath75 from eq .",
    "( [ qw ] ) , and @xmath76 for odd @xmath58 nuclei and @xmath77 for even @xmath58 nuclei .",
    "this factor takes into account the axial current of the last nucleon with @xmath78 .",
    "because this term adds in quadrature with @xmath79 , it makes a very small contribution , except for very light systems such as the proton .",
    "for example , using eq .",
    "( [ qeff ] ) we find that @xmath80ne and @xmath81ne have cross sections respectively 1.29 and 1.48 times that of @xmath59ne .",
    "natural ne is 0.3 % @xmath80ne and 8.8 % @xmath81ne so this will lead to a slight increase in yield over that for pure @xmath59ne .",
    "clean , a detector concept based on liquid ne , was originally proposed for the detection of low - energy solar neutrinos .",
    "it will also have high sensitivity to weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "liquid neon has a high scintillation yield , has no long - lived radioactive isotopes , and can be easily purified using cold traps .",
    "in addition , neon is inexpensive , dense , and transparent to its own scintillation light , making it practical for use in a large self - shielding apparatus .",
    "here we consider a clean detector in which a stainless steel tank holds 200 tons of liquid neon , half of which is exposed to a wavelength shifter to convert the ultraviolet light to the visible . inside the tank and suspended in the liquid neon are several thousand photomultipliers .",
    "a diagram of the proposed clean design is shown in figure 3 .",
    "clean will also be sensitive to supernova neutrinos , detected through neutrino - nuclear scattering . in this case",
    "the entire active neon mass inside the wavelength shifter can be used , with a possible modest fiducial volume cut to reduce radioactive backgrounds .    of prime importance for determining the sensitivity of clean to neutrino - nuclear scattering",
    "is the determination of the light yield of liquid neon for nuclear recoils . because the density of excitation in scintillator is typically higher for nuclear recoils than for electron recoils , the chemically excited species are more likely to interact , increasing the likelihood that energy will be lost through mechanisms that do not produce light .",
    "this quality is often expressed as a  quenching factor \" , the ratio of light emitted for a nuclear recoil to the light emitted from an electron recoil , per unit deposition energy .",
    "while the quenching factor for liquid neon has not yet been measured , we expect it to be similar in magnitude to the quenching factor measured for liquid xenon .",
    "recent ( and widely disagreeing ) measurements of the liquid xenon quenching factor@xcite are 22 % and 43 % .",
    "the amount of quenching for liquid neon should be less than that for liquid xenon , as the density ( 1.2 ) of liquid neon is less than that of liquid xenon , while the scintillation mechanism in liquid neon is qualitatively similar .",
    "for the following simulations , we assume that the quenching factor for liquid neon is 0.25 . clearly the scintillation quenching factor in liquid neon would have to be accurately measured in order to properly interpret any supernova data .",
    "as for all neutrino detectors , a prime design consideration in clean is the reduction of radioactive backgrounds . we expect that any radioactive species suspended in the liquid neon will be removed by passing the neon through charcoal or similar adsorbant ; however there will remain a high rate of gamma rays entering the liquid neon after being emitted by the surrounding photomultipliers , photomultiplier support structure , wavelength shifter , and stainless steel tank containing the liquid neon .",
    "figure 4 shows the expected supernova neutrino recoil spectrum for a clean detector with 100 tons of active liquid neon , assuming 3750 scintillation photons per mev , 100 % efficiency for the wavelength shifter , photomultiplier coverage of 75 % , and a photomultiplier quantum efficiency of 15 % .",
    "also shown is the expected radioactive background for 10 seconds of observing time , assuming that the combined gamma and x - ray emission is dominated by the photomultiplier glass and the wavelength shifter substrate .",
    "the simulation assumes photomultipliers 20 cm in diameter , each with mass 650 g , with 30 ng per g of u and th and 60 @xmath82 g per g of k in the glass .",
    "the wavelength shifter is assumed to be evaporated on quartz wafers of 1 mm thickness , with a u and th concentration of 1 ng per g. from @xmath83 seconds of simulated data , we find a background of 62 @xmath84 8 events in 10 seconds within the energy range of 0 to 200 kev . here",
    "the uncertainty corresponds to the @xmath84 1-sigma interval for a particular 10-second observation .",
    "since liquid neon has no long - lived radioactive isotopes that would limit its practical threshold , the clean detector could conceivably trigger on as few as two photoelectrons .",
    "the accidental coincidence rate in clean will be low , as the photomultiplier dark count rate will be suppressed at liquid - neon temperature ( 27 k ) .",
    "thus we expect that the full 100 tons of liquid neon could be viewed with a threshold of 2 photoelectrons , equivalent to a recoil energy of about 5 kev .",
    "the expected 62 background events is smaller than the expected supernova signal of 330 ne elastic events above 5 kev in 100 tons .",
    "the radioactive backgrounds , while small in comparison to the supernova signal , can be lowered further through position resolution , since most gamma rays will deposit their energy in the outer edges of the liquid neon sphere .",
    "recently , monte carlo simulations have shown that the location of ionizing radiation events in clean can be determined by analyzing the pattern of photomultiplier hits .",
    "these simulations are described in detail in an upcoming publication@xcite . here",
    "we show only some results relevant to supernova neutrino detection .",
    "we find that a mild fiducial radius cut , leaving a mass of 70 tons , virtually eliminates gamma - ray background for the purposes of supernova neutrino detection ( only 2.6 @xmath84 1.6 events in the fiducial volume in 10 seconds ) .",
    "these results are shown in figure 5 . in the case of a fiducial volume cut ,",
    "detecting a few more photoelectrons will improve the convergence of the position resolution algorithm .",
    "currently we can analyze events that produce as few as 8 photoelectrons ( recoil energy of 21 kev ) if position cuts are applied . in general , as the position cut is increased or the number of photoelectrons is reduced , algorithm convergence should be carefully checked .",
    "the expected 2.6 background events are much smaller than the expected supernova signal of 140 ne events above 21 kev in 70 tons .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio reported here , though already quite large , might be significantly improved by the development of photomultipliers with lower inherent radioactivity .",
    "such photomultipliers are under investigation by the clean and xenon collaborations .",
    "in addition , plans are being made to measure the quenching factor for nuclear recoils in liquid neon , as this measurement is important for the determination of the sensitivity of clean to wimp particles , as well as for supernova neutrinos .",
    "detectors with reduced radioactive backgrounds may be able to study supernovae via neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering .",
    "this could provide important information on the flux and spectrum of @xmath8 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "elastic - scattering detectors could see a few or more events per ton for a supernova at 10 kpc .",
    "this is 20 or more times the number of events per ton of existing water detectors .",
    "the clean experiment , based on the detection of scintillation in liquid ne , is a prime example of a detector that would be sensitive to the elastic scattering of supernova neutrinos .",
    "its active mass of 100 tons may yield almost 400 @xmath8 events .",
    "in addition , many other detectors , including the largest dark - matter and double - beta decay experiments , may also be sensitive to supernova neutrinos via elastic scattering .",
    "observation of neutrino - nuclear elastic scattering will complement supernova signals from other detectors .",
    "water detectors such as sno or super - k will detect @xmath8 without @xmath8 spectral information .",
    "this energy information could be important for neutrino oscillations .",
    "kamland may be able to measure @xmath85 elastic scattering .",
    "this contains energy information just like @xmath86 scattering .",
    "the small cross section for @xmath85 scattering may be compensated by a large detector mass .",
    "this may yield only slightly smaller statistics than clean .",
    "we strongly encourage development of detectors based on both @xmath85 and @xmath86 elastic scattering since they may have different backgrounds , thresholds , and systematic errors . furthermore ,",
    "the very large @xmath86 elastic cross sections may allow even larger statistics in future detectors .",
