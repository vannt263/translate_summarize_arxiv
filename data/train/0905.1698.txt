    "we explore the potential use of the hyperfine transition of 3 for studying the epoch of reionization ( eor ) and the post - reionization igm . in  2 we discuss aspects of the hyperfine transition for 3 and compare it with the corresponding transition of neutral hydrogen . some sources and absorbers of this transition in the igm",

    "the frequency of hyperfine transition is @xmath4  ghz , much higher than @xmath2  ghz frequency of the @xmath0  cm transition of hydrogen .",
    "a higher frequency for the 3 hyperfine transition implies that the emission signal from the eor is at frequencies where foregrounds are not as problematic as they are for @xmath0  cm observations .",
    "the magnetic moment of the @xmath3he nucleus is negative , and so the singlet is the excited state in the hyperfine transition while the triplet is the ground state .",

    "the maximum impact parameter of interest for exciting the 3 transition is set by the requirement that the energy transfer per single electron - ion collision be larger than the 3 transition energy .",
    "for the distance of closest approach of a thermal electron relative to a 3 ion , the typical energy transfer is @xmath58 , amounting to @xmath59  k for @xmath60  k. the transition energy of @xmath61k implies in this case a coulomb logarithm of @xmath62 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than its maximum value , obtained from the cumulative effect of all scatterings with a smaller energy exchangeformulary@xmath6309.pdf ] .",

    "the results were derived assuming that hydrogen is fully ionized and helium is singly ionized , and that the gas temperature is @xmath57  k. the spin de - excitation rate is proportional to the collisional rate , which in turn is is proportional to @xmath67 .",

    "a more detailed calculation of the collisional rate can be made using spin - dependent scattering cross - sections @xcite .",
    "figure  1 indicates that the spin temperature of 3 decouples from the gas temperature at very high redshifts for regions at the average cosmic density .",
    "however , even for regions with an overdensity of @xmath69 , the spin temperature is only a few times the cmb temperature @xmath70 through the eor .",
    "this factor alone suppresses the signal from such regions by about @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "regions with much higher overdensity decouple only at late times and emission from such regions is not affected significantly at high redshifts .",
    "for example , at @xmath73 the low spin temperature leads to an reduction in the signal by about @xmath71 . in general ,",
    "the reduction in signal due to a low spin temperature is negligible for regions with electron number density @xmath74 if the @xcite estimate is reliable .    during reionization ,",
    "brightness fluctuations on large scales ( tens of comoving mpc or arc minutes on the sky ) will be sourced by inhomogeneities in the 3 ionization fraction or in the kinetic temperature of the gas , which is heated to @xmath75k in ionized regions @xcite .",
    "the absorption signal could be searched for in the radio spectrum of radio - loud quasars or gamma - ray burst afterglows @xcite .",
    "absorption is expected to be weak in most situations , especially if the spin temperature is coupled to the kinetic temperature .",
    "the kinetic temperature in regions with substantial fraction of 3 is likely to be around @xmath57  k and hence the optical depth due to absorption is extremely small in regions with @xmath76 .",
    "next we discuss prospects of observing systems the hyperfine transition of 3 in emission during and after the eor .",
    "the expected signal is weak , and there is a further attenuation due to decoupling of gas temperature and spin temperature in regions that are not very overdense .",
    "thus , the most promising sources that may be detected and studied are those that are sufficiently overdense .",
    "ly-@xmath1 blobs , first discovered by @xcite , are of particular interest . by now , many such blobs have been detected , including one at a redshift @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "these blobs are hundreds of kpc across and contain gas at a high overdensity .",
    "the leading theoretical model for these blobs is accretion of cold gas at temperatures around @xmath80  k along filaments @xcite .",
    "irrespective of the detailed model , we can trivially deduce that gas in these blobs is at temperatures around @xmath57  k as much hotter gas will not emit much in ly-@xmath1 , and that the overdensities in these blobs are fairly high , certainly of the order of @xmath55 if not more .",
    "this makes such blobs a very strong source of radiation in the hyperfine transition of 3 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath81@xmath56 ( a reasonable assumption since we are dealing with gas inside collapsed haloes ) , @xmath82 , and @xmath83/[h(z)/(1+z ) ] \\sim 0.1 - 1 $ ] , the estimated 3 signal is in the range of @xmath54@xmath84  @xmath85k .",
    "since a large number of ly-@xmath1 blobs are known , a targeted study is possible .",
    "observations of blobs in the hyperfine transition of 3 can provide a direct handle on the the physical properties of the sources .",
    "the number density of ly-@xmath1 blobs is sufficiently high @xcite so that blind searches can also be undertaken in the redshifted radiation from the hyperfine transition of 3 .",
    "h  ii regions around clusters of the earliest galaxies are also an obvious source of this radiation . for typical stellar sources , @xmath3he",
    "is expected to be ionized together with hydrogen since its first ionization potential is only a factor of @xmath86 times larger @xcite .",
    "observational constraints on reionization models suggest that normal stars may suffice as a source of ionizing radiation and enrichment of the igm @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that tracing 3 at redshifts @xmath87 is equivalent to tracing the h  ii regions .",
    "a map of 3 of a representative cosmic volume during reionization would therefore largely appear as the contrast of a @xmath0  cm map of the same volume .",
    "anti - correlating the two signals would be helpful in strengthening the signal - to - noise ratio of both maps .",
    "in addition , a measurement of the 3 signal can be used ( in conjunction with @xmath0  cm data ) to determine the cosmic @xmath3he abundance as a test of big bang nucleosynthesis . note that for sources at redshift @xmath88 , the observed frequency is close to @xmath89  mhz and is in the regime where the sky temperature is subdominant to the system temperature for most existing and planned instruments . at high redshifts , even regions with moderate overdensities can be seen in emission .    in case of sources with a harder spectrum , we expect an inner region dominated by he  iii .",
    "the recombination time for he  iii is much smaller as compared to he  ii .",
    "this leads to formation of fossil 3 regions if the source of hard radiation switches off for an extended period of time .",
    "quasars are the most obvious source of hard uv radiation and these are known to have intermittent periods of activity",
    ". therefore fossil 3 regions at high redshift are also a promising source of signal .",
    "several existing and upcoming instruments have the required frequency coverage to attempt observations of the hyperfine transition in 3 .",
    "we summarize some of these here :    * the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) located near pune , india , has been in operation for over a decade and its performance is being enhanced through upgrades .",
    "the complete frequency range @xmath90  ghz is available , allowing observations of the hyperfine transition of 3 between @xmath91 , at least in principle .",
    "the best sensitivity achieved so far is @xmath92  @xmath85jygtac / gmrt_specs_status_dec08.pdf ] .",
    "this is close to two orders of magnitudes larger than the sensitivity required to observe ly-@xmath1 blobs , hence it will be difficult to use the gmrt for observing ly-@xmath1 blobs at high redshifts even with long integrations on a single source , unless upcoming upgrades can reduce the noise level by a significant amount . *",
    "the expanded very large array ( evla ) , is an upgraded version of the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "this facility will enter a testing phase with science projects in @xmath93 and is likely to be available for all users by @xmath94 .",
    "evla will have full coverage from @xmath25  ghz to @xmath95  ghz and hence can be used to probe 3 redshifts up to @xmath96 .",
    "the low frequency system is to be installed last .",
    "the overall sensitivity is slightly less than that for askap .",
    "* the australian square kilometer array pathfinder ( askap ) will comprise an array of @xmath97 antennas each @xmath98  m in diameter , capable of high dynamic range imaging and using wide - field - of - view phased array feeds .",
    "this observatory is expected to become operational by @xmath94 .",
    "frequencies between @xmath99  mhz and @xmath86  ghz will be accessible using askap indicating that it may be possible to observe up to @xmath100",
    ". the stated sensitivity will be insufficient for observing ly-@xmath1 blobs with around @xmath56 hours of integration time .",
    "however , the field of view for this instrument is large and it may be possible to run a piggyback survey where co - adding the signal from many known ly-@xmath1 blobs may be used to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio . * the square kilometer array ( ska )",
    "is expected to have an effective collecting area that is nearly two orders of magnitudes larger than ska pathfinders like the askap .",
    "this alone ensures that observations of ly-@xmath1 blobs will be possible with the ska with an integration of just above a hundred hours .",
    "finally we comment on the issue of foregrounds .",
    "the sky temperature @xmath101 is a very strong function of frequency at low frequencies , scaling as @xmath102 at low frequencies ( @xmath103  ghz ) .",
    "given the difference in rest frame frequencies of the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen and 3 , the expected difference in the sky temperature for observing the same redshift differs by a factor of almost @xmath104 .",
    "this nearly compensates for the difference in the expected signals for the two transitions at the highest redshifts of interest for the epoch of reionization studies . at lower redshifts , @xmath105 for most upcoming arrays and",
    "the instrumental noise is the dominant factor .",
    "furthermore , the higher frequency implies than the sun and ionosphere are not very serious problems and day time observations may also be possible , thereby increasing the possible integration time on one source .    for redshifts beyond @xmath106 ,",
    "h  i at low redshifts is a foreground contaminant for the hyperfine transition of 3 .",
    "this is not likely to be a cause for concern for targeted studies but is an issue for statistical detection .",
    "one may either choose _ clean _ lines of sight , or use differences in the angular and redshift space distribution of foregrounds as compared to the signal .",
    "recombination lines of hydrogen can be a source of confusion , particularly if the number densities of electrons are more than a few per @xmath107 .",
    "observations of h  ii regions @xcite find several lines of this type near the 3 hyperfine transition .",
    "the impact of such lines on cosmological observations has been found to be small by @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have considered the use of the hyperfine transition of 3 for studies of the igm , with an emphasis on the possibility of detecting it in emission .",
    "the frequency of the 3 transition is @xmath108 times larger while its radiative decay rate is almost three orders of magnitude higher than those of the @xmath0  cm transition of hydrogen .",
    "these parameters lead to a weaker coupling between the kinetic temperature of the igm and the 3 spin temperature .",
    "however , 3 naturally exists in regions where the gas temperature is relatively high ( @xmath75k ) and even this weak coupling can ensure @xmath109 in moderately overdense regions .",
    "although the abundance of @xmath3he is around @xmath110 times that of hydrogen , its hyperfine signal is boosted by its higher decay rate .",
    "additional gain in the signal - to - noise ratio originates from the lower sky temperature at the frequency of the 3 transition as compared with the sky temperature for the @xmath0  cm radiation at the same redshift .",
    "thus , observing the 3 signal may not be much more challenging than observing the redshifted @xmath0  cm signal .",
    "the higher rest frame frequency of the hyperfine transition of 3 also allows one to probe physical scales that are six times smaller , as compared to those that can be accessed with the @xmath0  cm radiation using the same instrument for a region at the same redshift .",
    "we find that the extended ly-@xmath1 blobs seen at high redshifts are the most promising source in this transition and that 3 observations may shed new light on the physical conditions in these regions",
    ". a number of ly-@xmath1 blobs are already known and it is possible to conduct a targeted study . the expected signal of @xmath54@xmath111k should be within the reach of upcoming instruments . in the longer term , observations of the hyperfine transition in 3 may be used to probe cosmological h  ii regions during the eor .",
