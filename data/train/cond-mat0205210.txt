    "since the achievement of bose einstein condensation ( bec ) of neutral atoms in 1995 , the field of cold atoms has been substantially developed , both in the parameter range ( number of atoms , temperature , _ etc _ ) , and in the variety of systems studied . in particular , low - dimensional atomic systems became a subject of significant interest as a consequence of the existence of nontrivial strong phase fluctuations and also due to the peculiar scattering properties @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose gases play a special role in this sub - field thanks to a rich phase diagram @xcite .",
    "experimentaly , a two - dimensional quasi - condensate has been first achieved with spin - polarized hydrogen atoms adsorbed on a liquid @xmath0he film @xcite .",
    "several groups have now reached the 2d regime with ultra cold atoms trapped using evanescent light waves @xcite or optical lattices @xcite . in the latter trap ,",
    "thermaly activated vortices which plays a central role in the berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless phase transition have been observed experimentaly @xcite .",
    "ultra - cold atoms in two dimensions are also interesting due to the fact that the atom - atom effective coupling constant can be easily tuned @xcite by varying the axial confinement of the trap and/or by using a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "consequently , ultra - cold atoms experiments open interesting perspectives for a detailed study of atomic bec in strictly ( _ i.e. _ with no excited transverse modes present ) two - dimensional configurations in a broad range of experimental parameters .    using the 2d equation of state , we show that in the resonant regime where the two - dimensional scattering length exceeds the size of the transverse confinement ( and becomes the only relevant length scale associated with the interatomic interactions ) the gas remains stable ( at least for sufficiently small areal densities ) , even though the corresponding three - dimensional scattering length becomes negative in this regime .",
    "moreover , since in the resonant regime the 2d gas parameter becomes relatively high , the formation of dimers in three - body collisions becomes relevant @xcite .",
    "therefore , we study further the stability of the resonant two - dimensional condensate _",
    "vis a vis _ this process .",
    "the paper is composed of two parts . in the first part",
    ", we review common low energy collisional features for two ultra - cold atoms in a planar harmonic guide and give the definition of the 2d scattering length ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the effective interaction between two confined atoms is described using the zero - range approximation within the @xmath2-potential formalism .",
    "the resonant regime for two - body scattering is defined by the condition @xmath3 .",
    "a bound state of vanishing energy and large spatial extension ( of the order of @xmath1 ) emerges under these conditions : this is nothing else but a dimer which is populated by three body processes in a dilute resonant gas .    in the second part",
    ", we consider the 2d atomic bose gas of areal density @xmath4 . for low areal density systems where the interparticle distance is much larger than the transverse confinement @xmath5 , the interaction can be described in terms of the 2d scattering length only . for small gas parameters @xmath6 ,",
    "the two - dimensional equation of state shows no sign of a collapse even though the corresponding three - dimensional scattering length @xmath7 is negative in the two - dimensional resonant regime .",
    "finally , we evaluate the rate of three - body atomic recombinaison into the shalow dimer and give an estimate for the life time of a two - dimensional atomic condensate at the onset of the resonant regime .",
    "we consider two atoms in an harmonic planar waveguide characterized by the angular atomic frequency @xmath8 in the transverse direction @xmath9 .",
    "the characteristic length is given by the size of the ground transverse mode @xmath10 .",
    "the two atoms have the same mass @xmath11 and are located at positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "we further decompose the position vectors into a sum of longitudinal ( parallel to @xmath14-plane ) and transverse ( along @xmath9 axis ) components : @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a unit vector in the transverse direction .",
    "this system can be considered as 2d when the energy of the relative motion @xmath18 is close to the threshold between the monomode and non - propagating regimes : @xmath19 .",
    "then , for @xmath20 , the two - body wave function factorizes as : @xmath21      in a scattering process at energy @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) , and for large relative distance ( @xmath24 ) , the 2d wave function is @xcite : @xmath25 in eq.([eq : scatt_ampl ] ) @xmath26 are the relative coordinates , the constant @xmath1 is the `` 2d scattering length '' and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the euler constant .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that @xmath1 is a function of the characteristic length of the trap @xmath29 and also of the three dimensional scattering length @xmath7 with @xcite : @xmath30      let us introduce the notion of a zero - range two - dimensional interaction potential for the two trapped atoms .",
    "for this purpose , we use the fact that the radius of the interatomic forces @xmath31 is very small as compared to all the lengths considered in this paper , so that the 3d wave function is a solution of the free schrdinger equation ( @xmath32 ) : @xmath33 consequently , for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the 2d wave function @xmath36 is also solution of the free schrdinger equation .",
    "hence , @xmath36 has a logarithmic behavior for small interparticle distances ( in the scattering process this corresponds to @xmath37 but @xmath34 ) .",
    "the idea of the zero - range approach is to consider the extension of @xmath36 defined as a solution of the free schrdinger equation @xmath38 and to impose the correct behavior of the wave function for @xmath39 from a contact condition taken formally at @xmath40 . using the expression of the scattering states in eq.([eq : scatt_ampl ] ) extended in the region @xmath41",
    ", one can verify that all the two - body states which are linear combinations of ( [ eq : scatt_ampl ] ) can be deduced from the contact condition : @xmath42 where @xmath43 depends on the state considered and also can be a function of the center of mass coordinates .",
    "the zero range two - dimensional potential introduced in ref.@xcite allows to incorporate the contact condition ( [ eq : contact1 ] ) in the schrdinger equation defined @xmath44 ( at @xmath40 , the identity @xmath45 is used ) .",
    "it has the following expression : @xmath46 \\ , , \\label{eq:2d_ppot}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "this potential acts on wave functions of the form ( [ eq : contact1 ] ) as : @xmath47 and gives a result independent of @xmath2 .",
    "let us emphasize that this property is not general : the action of @xmath48 on a two - body wave function which has not the singularity given by eq.([eq : contact1 ] ) leads to a @xmath2-dependent result , showing also that such wave function is not in the proper hilbert space .      in the regime of large 2d scattering length @xmath49 which corresponds to the situation of negative 3d scattering length @xmath50 ,",
    "the scattering cross section is maximum for @xmath51 . in this resonant regime",
    ", there exists a low energy two - body bound state ( refered hereafter as the dimer state ) with a spatial extension of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "its wave function @xmath52 and binding energy @xmath53 can be deduced from the contact condition ( [ eq : contact1 ] ) or also from the pseudo - potential ( [ eq:2d_ppot ] ) .",
    "one obtains : @xmath54 now , the key point for the following part is that the state in eq.([eq : dimer ] ) has an extension of the order of @xmath1 : as a consequence it corresponds to the asymptotic part of a physical one in the regime : @xmath55 as a consequence of the exponential behavior in eq.([eq : a2d ] ) , this resonant regime is achieved for negative three dimensional scattering length and : @xmath56",
    "we consider an atomic bose gas characterized by an areal density @xmath4 and confined in the planar wave guide with @xmath57 , so that only the ground transverse mode is populated . in the dilute limit defined by a small 2d gas parameter : @xmath58 the 2d equation of state at zero temperature is @xcite : @xmath59 for sufficiently small areal densities such that eq.([eq : dilute ] ) is satisfied , eq.([eq : popov ] ) shows that @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "consequently for a vanishing areal density , the system is thermodynamically stable which means an absence of collapse .",
    "this is in particular true in the regime of negative three dimensional scattering length @xmath50 , where an instability occurs for the homogeneous gas in absence of trapping . due to the exponential behavior of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath7 in eq.([eq : a2d ] ) , the condition ( [ eq : dilute ] ) is too stringent to reach for @xmath63 and the more interesting situation corresponds to the onset of the resonant regime : @xmath64 however one can notice that even at the onset , the condition defined by eq.([eq : dilute ] ) is severe and is difficult to satisfy for clouds involving thousand of atoms ( as a consequence of the radial trapping ) @xcite .    however , even if the 2d bose homogeneous gas is stable against collapse in the peculiar regime defined by eqs.([eq : dilute],[eq : onset ] ) , its stability is limited by three body recombinaison processes into the shallow dimer eq.([eq : dimer ] ) . in the next section we adress this question and give an estimation for the life - time in this regime .",
    "hence , we give a limit on the possible occurence of an atomic condensate for increasing values of the 2d gas parameter obtained by a variation of the 2d scattering length .      the problem",
    "that we are considering is reminescent of the three dimensionnal resonant bose gas where three body recombinations populate a dimer state of vanishing energy and diverging width @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the transverse length @xmath29 plays the role of an effective range and eq.([eq : univ ] ) is analogous to the resonant regime in 3d where @xmath65 .",
    "however the two situations are not completely similar . indeed , in the 2d resonant regime eq.([eq :",
    "univ ] ) a single parameter @xmath1 is sufficient for a characterization of the low energy properties in few- and many - body systems @xcite , while in 3d at least one more parameter is needed @xcite .",
    "moreover , in 2d the low energy two - body cross section strongly depends on the energy so that one expects a strong variation of the recombination rate with respect to the gas parameter which fixes the typical collisional energy .",
    "a straighforward dimensional analysis gives the following law for the recombination constant : @xmath66 and the purpose of the subsequent three - body analysis is to evaluate the function @xmath67 .",
    "we consider three atoms @xmath68 of equal mass @xmath11 which after a collision lead to the formation of a dimer @xcite .",
    "there are three outgoing channel for this process obtained by cyclic permutation from : @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the dimer and @xmath71 labels this particular channel .",
    "the problem can be solved using the faddeev equations @xcite in spatial coordinates .",
    "this approach is very efficient for the determination in the configuration space of the two universal three - body bound states in two dimensions @xcite ( these states where first obtained in the momentum representation in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the positions of the atoms @xmath68 are defined on the plane by the coordinates @xmath72 respectively .",
    "the wave function factorizes in a @xmath9-part frozen in the ground state of the transverse harmonic oscillator ( omitted in the following ) and a 2d part @xmath73 .",
    "the wave function @xmath74 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian : @xmath75 to be consistent with the 2d regime , the eigen - energy of this state must be below the transverse level spacing , @xmath35 .",
    "the potential part in eq.([eq : h3 ] ) imposes the contact condition ( [ eq : contact1 ] ) for cyclic permutations of the three particles . in the center of mass frame , the wave function , which is symmetric as a consequence of the symmetrization postulate is decomposed as : @xmath76 with the jacobi variables defined by : @xmath77 the other variables @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be also introduced via cyclic permutations of the three atoms .",
    "we use then the hyperspherical coordinates @xmath80 defined by : @xmath81 and hyperangles @xmath82 and @xmath83 are obtained by cyclic permutations . as we are interested in a low energy process , the 3-body wave function is a @xmath84-state which does not depend on the planar angles .",
    "consequently , the kinetic operator in eq.([eq : h3 ] ) is simply @xmath85 in this coordinate system , the contact condition reads @xmath86 and the contact conditions for @xmath82 and @xmath83 have an analogous form .",
    "we are going to show now , that the knowledge of the function @xmath87 is sufficient for the determination of the three body recombination rate . for this purpose",
    ", we use the expression of the on - shell @xmath88-matrix element from the initial channel of three atoms in the continuum of positive total energy @xmath89 , to the outgoing channel @xmath90 @xmath91 in eq.([eq : tif ] ) , @xmath74 is the exact 3-body eigen - function of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h3 ] ) corresponding to the initial state , and @xmath92 is the non - interacting 3-body wave function for the outgoing channel @xmath90 : @xmath93 where the wave number @xmath94 is obtained from the energy conservation in the 3-body process : @xmath95 . the interacting potential @xmath96 which appears in eq.([eq : tif ] )",
    "is the scattering potential for channel @xmath71 @xcite : @xmath97 summing up the contributions of the three possible outgoing channels , one obtains the total @xmath88-matrix element : @xmath98 from eqs.([eq : contact2],[eq : tif1 ] ) , the total @xmath88-matrix element can be deduced from : @xmath99 this relation can be understood qualitatively if one remarks from eq.([eq : contact2 ] ) , that @xmath87 is linked to the probability of finding one atom at distance @xmath100 from a colliding pair with an interparticle spacing smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "then , as the integration of this function in ( [ eq : t_if ] ) is over lengths of the order of @xmath1 , the value of @xmath101 depends crucially on the probability of finding three atoms at relative distance @xmath1 , which coincides also with the extension of the dimer .",
    "note that the result ( [ eq : t_if ] ) does not depend on @xmath2 as expected for a theory which provides the exact contact conditions on the wave function",
    ".    the determination of the function @xmath102 can be in principle obtained from the decomposition of the wave function over a hyperspherical harmonics basis @xcite : @xmath103 where @xmath104 and for each value of the hyper - radius @xmath100 , @xmath105 is an eigen - function of the operator @xmath106 with the eigen - value @xmath107 ( this step is very reminiscent of the 2-body problem ) .",
    "taking into account the fact that the functions @xmath105 are finite for @xmath108 , we obtain : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the usual legendre function and : @xmath111 for a given value of @xmath100 , the normalization constant @xmath112 is defined by integration over the angles @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( associated to @xmath115 ) : @xmath116 in the limit @xmath117 , the functions @xmath118 in eq.([eq : phi ] ) exhibit a logarithmic singularity : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function .",
    "hence , for each value of @xmath100 the contact condition in eq.([eq : contact2 ] ) is satified if the eigenvalue @xmath107 is a solution of the equation : @xmath121 the left hand side of eq.([eq : eigenvalue ] ) is a function of @xmath122 that we denote by @xmath123 .",
    "this function has several branches associated to the harmonics in eq.([eq : decomposition ] ) and the two first ones are represented in fig.([fig : lambda ] ) .",
    " left hand side of eq.([eq : eigenvalue]).,width=264 ]    solution of eq.([eq : eigenvalue ] ) in each branch defines a hyperspherical harmonic @xmath124 . as the initial non interacting state corresponds to three atoms in the continuum with a vanishing energy , the most important weight in the decomposition of eq.([eq : decomposition ] ) is the harmonic corresponding to the lowest positive eigenvalue .",
    "we then limit our study to a single harmonic analysis with the wave function : @xmath125 the approximation used here is linked to the fact that we can identify a slow variable ( @xmath100 ) and a fast variable ( @xmath113 ) which are almost separable .",
    "the function @xmath87 can then be deduced from : @xmath126 for each value of @xmath127 , we solve eq.([eq : eigenvalue ] ) in the domain @xmath128 $ ] . this way we construct the function @xmath129 which leads to an effective kinetic barrier in the one dimensional equation for @xmath130  : @xmath131 in eq.([eq : f ] ) , @xmath132 is the momentum defined by the energy of the process @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) . in the limit of very large hyper - radius ,",
    "the amplitude of @xmath135 is fixed by considering the asymptotic behavior of the free incoming wavefunction , so that @xmath136 we apply now this formalism by considering three atoms initially in the 2d atomic bose condensate of areal density @xmath4 at the onset of the resonant regime ( [ eq : onset ] ) .",
    "the typical energy in the collision process is given by @xmath137 .",
    "for simplicity the chemical potential can be evaluated by use of the schick s formula @xcite which is an approximate form of the equation of state : @xmath138 the gas parameter is small @xmath6 which implies also that the collisional energy is such that @xmath139 .",
    "an analysis similar to ref.@xcite gives the number of processes per unit time and surface and permits an identification of the function @xmath140 ( where @xmath141 is the 2d gas parameter ) entering in the recombination constant @xmath142 ( [ eq : thelaw ] ) with @xmath143 , and the life - time of the atomic bose gas is  : @xmath144 in fig.([fig : universal ] ) , we have plot the function @xmath145 .     entering in eq.([eq : tau]),width=302 ]    as an example , we consider @xmath146li atoms confined in a wave - guide of atomic frequency @xmath147  khz ( @xmath148  nm and is very much larger than the range of the true interatomic forces @xmath149  nm ) with a 2d gas parameter @xmath150",
    "@xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "we obtain for such configuration a very short life time @xmath153  s , showing that the 2d atomic condensate decays rapidly by creating dimers in three - body 2d recombination processes and not by experiencing a collapse phenomenon ( @xmath50 ) . for a smaller but also `` large '' 2d gas parameter as @xmath154 with @xmath152",
    ", then @xmath155  s showing that the atomic condenstae may be observable for relatively high values of the gas parameter .",
    "however , as shown on fig.([fig : universal ] ) , @xmath156 exhibits a rapid decrease with respect to the gas parameter @xmath157 , so that for @xmath157 on the order of @xmath158 , the atomic condensate decays very rapidly .",
    "in this paper we analyse two potential sources of instability of two - dimensional atomic bose condensates in the universal resonant regime of the large two - dimensional scattering length ( corresponding to a negative three - dimensional scatterring length of the order or less than the size of the transverse confinement ) : a macroscopic collapse and a loss of atoms through formation of shallow dimers in three - body collisions .",
    "we show that ( a ) the gas is stable against collapse and that ( b ) in the above regime the upper limit on the condensate life - time set by the three - body recombination can be relatively long .",
    "moreover , for a trap sufficiently deep in the longitudinal direction , dimers can be kept in the trap opening the possibility of a series of recombination process with successive formations of three- and four - body bound states toward `` 2d bosons droplets '' states such as predicted in ref.@xcite .",
