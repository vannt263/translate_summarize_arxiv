    "one attractive idea of unifying active galactic nuclei ( agns ) of types seyfert 1 and 2 , depending on whether strong , broad emission lines are visible or not , hinges upon the existence of a dust torus that surrounds the broad - line region ( blr ) @xcite . a direct view of the blr through the inner hole of the dust torus seen face - on yields a seyfert 1 spectrum , whereas an obscuration of the blr by the dust torus seen edge - on results in a seyfert 2 spectrum .",
    "although this unified model has been supported in many ways already , the strongest justification would come from confirming the existence of the dust torus surrounding the blr . since modern technology has not yet reached a point where one might spatially resolve the innermost structure of agns , the only method available to uncover it is a lag analysis in light curves , known as reverberation mapping .",
    "the near - infrared continuum ( @xmath4 m ) emission of seyfert galaxies is considered to be dominated by thermal radiation from hot dust surrounding the central engine , based on the decomposition of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of agns ( e.g. kobayashi et al .",
    "the dust closest to the central engine has higher temperatures , but can not survive inside some critical radius at which it begins to sublimate .",
    "accordingly , the distribution of dust should be torus - like , with a hole at the critical radius , and the dust at the innermost point of the torus has the maximum temperature equal to the sublimation temperature .",
    "this dust produces thermal emission which has a peak luminosity at the corresponding near - infrared wavelength .",
    "clear evidence that the hot dust is located some distance from the center of the central engine in agns is the existence of a lag time between the uv or optical light curve and the near - infrared light curve of an agn .",
    "it is interpreted in terms of light travel time from the central engine , which almost simultaneously emits uv and optical radiation to the surrounding hot dust , which reprocesses the radiation from the central engine to thermal near - infrared radiation .",
    "previous studies reported such lags of @xmath5 days for at most ten agns @xcite , however , the number of targets and the measurement errors were somewhat limited .    to make it possible to carry out much more intense monitoring observations of many agns in optical and the near - infrared the magnum ( ulticolor ctive alactic clei onitoring ) project installed a 2-meter telescope at the haleakala observatories in hawaii @xcite , and started its operation in early 2001 .",
    "in this _ letter _",
    ", as an early result of the magnum project , we present the @xmath6 and @xmath7 light curves of a bright seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151 for the period including the epoch of flux minimum in 2001 , and report a measurement of lag - time between them based on a cross - correlation analysis . due to the high frequency and high signal - to - noise ratio of our monitoring observations ,",
    "the measured lag is the most precise ever made , not only for ngc 4151 but also for any other agns .",
    "then it was compared with the previously measured lag - times of other agns in literature , and interpreted by thermal dust reverberation in ngc 4151 .",
    "the lag - time between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves corresponds to the light travel - time between the central engine and the inner radius of the dust torus , and with this result , we argue in favor of the unified model that ngc 4151 has a dust torus whose innermost radius is well outside the blr .",
    "monitoring observations of ngc 4151 started january , 2001 in the @xmath0 band and the @xmath1 band , using the multicolor imaging photometer ( mip ) mounted on the magnum telescope @xcite .",
    "the field of view of the mip is @xmath8 arcmin@xmath9 , and it enables simultaneous imaging in optical and near - infrared by splitting the incident beam into two different detectors , a site ccd ( @xmath10 pixels , @xmath11 arcsec / pixel ) and an sbrc insb array ( @xmath12 pixels , @xmath13 arcsec / pixel ) .",
    "we obtained photometric data for ngc 4151 between january and december 2001 , consisting of @xmath14 nights in the @xmath0 band and @xmath15 nights in the @xmath1 band . with the exception of the three months during solar conjunction , from mid - august to the beginning of november , the average interval of the observations was less than a week .",
    "this monitoring has provided the most frequent simultaneous optical and near - infrared sampling of ngc 4151 to date .",
    "the telescope was pointed at ngc 4151 and two reference stars with ( @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath17 ) alternately , and then it was dithered . in this manner ,",
    "high signal - to - noise ratios were achieved with total on - source integration time of a few minutes for each observation .",
    "the typical fwhms of the point spread function ( psf ) during the observation were 1.5 arcsec in the @xmath0 band and 1.1 arcsec in the @xmath1 band , respectively .",
    "the images were reduced using iraf .",
    "we followed standard procedures for image reduction , with small corrections for the non - linear response of the detectors .",
    "for the infrared image reduction , a sky image assembled from dithered images pointed at the reference stars was subtracted prior to flat - fielding .",
    "then , flat - field corrections were applied using dome flats for the optical images , or an illumination - corrected dome flats for the near - infrared images .",
    "the nuclear flux of ngc 4151 was measured relative to the reference stars , then the fluxes of these stars were calibrated .",
    "aperture photometry within @xmath18 arcsec was applied to all images , then the fluxes of the ngc 4151 nucleus and the reference stars were compared for each dithering set .",
    "finally , the nuclear flux relative to the reference stars was estimated from the average of the relative fluxes for all of the dithering sets .",
    "the photometric errors for data taken each night were usually better than @xmath19 mag .",
    "the flux ratio between the reference stars was also monitored ; it was confirmed that they were not variable stars .",
    "the fluxes of the reference stars were calibrated with respect to photometric standard stars taken from @xcite and @xcite , and a small correction for the filter color term in the @xmath0 band was applied .",
    "the flux calibration errors were less than 0.01 mag in @xmath0 and about 0.01 mag in @xmath1 .",
    "the flux of the host galaxy within the aperture was estimated by fitting the galaxy profile using the galfit @xcite .",
    "the flux of the host galaxy in the @xmath0 band was slightly dependent on the seeing fwhm , and was corrected for .",
    "the flux of the host galaxy was subtracted from the aperture flux ; the errors arising from this subtraction were about 0.1 mag .",
    "we note that the subtraction provides only a flux offset , which does not affect the cross - correlation function analysis below .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves of ngc 4151 nucleus in 2001 .",
    "the @xmath0 flux minimum was observed at epoch @xmath20 ; the @xmath1 flux minimum was clearly delayed behind the @xmath0 flux minimum by about @xmath21 days .",
    "while the @xmath0 light curve exhibited some variability on short time - scales comparable to the typical monitoring interval of several days , the @xmath1 light curve changed smoothly for the whole period of the monitoring observations .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath1 band emitting region is extended more than a scale of several light - days .    in order to obtain a more quantitative estimate of the lag - time between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves ,",
    "a cross - correlation analysis was applied . a cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of irregularly sampled photometric data",
    "was computed based on the linear interpolation method @xcite , as modified below .",
    "the first method is a `` bidirectionally interpolated '' ccf .",
    "each flux data point of one band , @xmath22 , at an epoch @xmath23 , is paired with the linearly interpolated flux of the other band , @xmath24 , with a lag - time , @xmath25 , then the ccf@xmath26 is computed from all data pairs @xmath27 and @xmath28 , not the average of two ccfs each from @xmath27 and @xmath28 as is often done .",
    "the second method is to obtain an `` equally sampled '' ccf .",
    "both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves are linearly interpolated to produce the flux data points every day , then the ccf@xmath26 is computed between those equally sampled light curves .",
    "the third method is the mccf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the mccf parameter max was 10 days ) .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation was carried out to estimate the lag - time error using the ccf analysis .",
    "many ccfs were calculated from artificial light curves , constructed by interpolating the observed light curves . in the artificial light curves",
    ", we incorporated not only the photometric errors at the observed data points , but also the short time - scale flux variation between the observed data points which serves to increase the scatter of the light curves at the interpolated data points .",
    "the flux variation was incorporated so that the structure function of the artificial light curves reproduced that of the observed light curve .",
    "we note that the error estimation here incorporated only the random errors caused by the photometric error and the flux variation , and there may be some possible systematic error .",
    "the details of the ccf computation and the simulation are described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the ccfs between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves of ngc 4151 .",
    "only the photometric data points ( 37 points in @xmath0 and 42 points in @xmath1 ) before the solar conjunction were used .",
    "all ccfs have a peak at the same lag - time of @xmath29 days .",
    "the average and the standard deviation of the lag - time at the ccf peak calculated from the simulation were @xmath30 and @xmath31 days for the `` bidirectionally interpolated '' ccf , @xmath32 and @xmath33 days for the `` equally sampled '' ccf , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 days for the mccf . to be conservative ,",
    "hereafter we use @xmath36 days as representative of the measured lag - time and the standard deviation error .",
    "the estimated lag - time of @xmath29 days indicate that the @xmath1 band emitting region was located at distance of 0.04 pc away from the central engine .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the lag - time of ngc 4151 , together with those of other quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies in the literature , plotted against their absolute @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "the lag - times between the uv or optical light curve and the @xmath1 light curve were taken from the original references @xcite .",
    "the lag - time data are restricted to those that were estimated by ccf analyses applied to the light curves .",
    "the absolute @xmath0 magnitudes were estimated from their apparent magnitudes and redshifts in a range of @xmath37 km / s , assuming cosmological parameters of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the flux of the host galaxy within the aperture was subtracted by using the image decomposition technique , or the flux variation gradient ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "*  ; this work ) .",
    "galactic extinction was corrected for @xcite , but the intrinsic extinction in agns was ignored here for simplicity , because they were all seyfert type 1 like agns .",
    "a k - correction was applied assuming a power - law spectrum of @xmath39 @xcite . the observed lag - time",
    "was multiplied by a factor of @xmath40 to correct for the cosmological time dilation .",
    "is dominated by the thermal emission from heated dust of temperature @xmath41 which peaks at @xmath42 , the location of such dust at radius @xmath43 for given central luminosity scales as @xmath44 @xcite , leading to @xmath45 .",
    "then , the lag - time correction for the cosmological wavelength dilation is expected to be a factor of @xmath46 , opposite to that for the cosmological time dilation @xcite . in the case of gq comae , having the largest redshift in the sample shown in figure 3 , this correction is equal to @xmath47 , placing the point ( c ) even closer to the inclined line . ]    it is clearly seen in figure [ fig3 ] that the lag - time is correlated with the absolute @xmath0 magnitude of the source , spanning over a range of 100 times in luminosity and 10 times in lag - time , in the sense that a luminous agn has a larger lag - time .",
    "a similar correlation has been previously noted by @xcite , using the uv luminosity instead of @xmath0 .",
    "the inclined line ( @xmath48 ) shown in figure [ fig3 ] is a fit to the data , with the expected slope of @xmath49 from the reverberation of thermal emission of the hot dust surrounding the central engine .",
    "the inner radius of the dust torus is determined by the highest sublimation temperature of the dust , around @xmath50 k for graphite grains @xcite or @xmath51 k for silicate grains @xcite .",
    "the dust at the innermost limit of the torus produces strong thermal emission in the near - infrared .",
    "since the sublimation radius is proportional to the square root of luminosity of the central engine @xcite , the lag - time between the uv / optical and the @xmath1 light curves , which would corresponds to a light travel - time between the central engine and the inner radius of the dust torus , should be proportional to the square root of the luminosity of the central engine .",
    "several studies have applied dust reverberation models to fairall 9 @xcite and mrk 744 @xcite , and estimated maximum temperatures for the circumnuclear dust to be comparable to the expected sublimation temperature .",
    "the good correlations that exist between the reported lag - times and the absolute @xmath0 magnitude along the expected slope from thermal dust reverberation , including our new result for ngc 4151 , indicate that the @xmath1 band emission of ngc 4151 is likely to be dominated by the thermal radiation of hot dust at its innermost radius ; the radius of the dust torus would be @xmath3 pc in order to correspond to the observed lag - time of @xmath52 days .",
    "there are measurements of shorter lag - times for ngc 4151 in the past , such as @xmath53 days in @xmath54 and @xmath55 days in @xmath56 by @xcite .",
    "given a two - sigma level of their measurement error , then it may be possible to interpret that the recovering time - scale of the inner dust was so long , more than a few years , that the inner radius of the dust torus was not reduced after the most luminous state in @xmath56 .",
    "however , the past data suffered from relatively large lag - time errors . in order to make it clear",
    ", it must be important to continue intense monitoring observation of ngc 4151 to measure the lag - times at different epochs accurately , and in addition , monitoring the near - infrared color is also important because the dust temperature at the inner torus should change with flux variation when the inner radius of the dust torus is constant .",
    "next , the measured lag - time for the dust torus is compared with similar estimates for the blr , based on broad emission - line reverberation measurements .",
    "@xcite observed not only the lag - times of near - infrared emission but also those of far - uv broad emission - lines , and concluded that the blr lies inside the dust shell in the seyfert 1 galaxy fairall 9 .",
    "although we did not observe broad emission - lines at the same time , the measured lag - time of @xmath2 days for @xmath1 band emission was quite precise , and should correspond to the inner radius of the dust torus .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to compare it with previous measurements of the lag - times of broad emission - lines",
    ". it is noted that the previous reports differ somewhat between the lines observed and the observations , such as @xmath57 days for civ and mgii @xcite , @xmath58 days for h@xmath59 and h@xmath60 @xcite , @xmath61 days for h@xmath59 and @xmath62 days for h@xmath60 @xcite , @xmath63 days for civ @xcite , and @xmath64 days for h@xmath59 and h@xmath60 @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that the spatial distribution of the blr clouds should be more extended than that estimated from the lag - times of the observed emission lines @xcite .",
    "even if this is the case , the inner radius of the dust torus in ngc 4151 is found to be well outside the blr , therefore , the blr in ngc 4151 can be observed directly without strong obscuration unless the dust torus is edge - on . also the near - infrared emission dominated by thermal radiation from hot dust at the innermost region is observed without strong obscuration due to outer cold dust .",
    "these results are consistent with the unified model of seyfert types of agns .",
    "an optical and near - infrared monitoring observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151 was carried out , and a lag - time between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves at the flux minimum in 2001 was estimated at @xmath36 days by a cross - correlation analysis .",
    "we present that the lag - time between the uv or optical and the @xmath1 light curves is correlated with the absolute @xmath0 magnitude of agn , and conclude that the @xmath1 band emission of ngc 4151 is dominated by the thermal radiation of innermost hot dust whose temperature is comparable to dust sublimation , and that the inner radius of the dust torus of ngc 4151 is @xmath3 pc , which is well outside the blr .",
    "the ongoing intense multicolor monitoring observations of ngc 4151 and many other agns in the magnum project will not only study the detailed geometry of the dust tori and further examine the unified model , but also constrain the real - time change in size of the dust tori and the time - scales of dust formation and destruction under extreme circumstances in agns from measurements of @xmath65 at different epochs along the light curves and the near - infrared color with flux variation .",
    "we thank mamoru doi and kentaro motohara for helpful discussions and advices during the observations , and also thank colleagues at the haleakala observatories for their help for the facility maintenance .",
    "we are grateful to timothy c. beers for his useful comments .",
