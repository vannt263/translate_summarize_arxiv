    "characteristic fields separated the regions of stability are determined as @xmath55 it is note that in the absence of the single - ion anisotropy the expression for the exchange field coincides with the saturation field for the exactly solvable quantum models of the heisenberg and ising magnets .    if the anisotropy is purely exchange , @xmath56 , the degenerate case with the equal fields @xmath57 and @xmath58 appears . if @xmath59 , the transition from the collinear state @xmath45 to the spin - flop state @xmath50 is discontinuous ( sft is a first - order transition ) .",

    "the effective anisotropy can be easy - axis . in the range of fields @xmath68 the value",
    "@xmath10 changes linearly from 0 to @xmath69 , but the slope of the straight line is deeper than in the case of the spin - flop phase , see fig .",

    "these results can be juxtaposed with the magnetization curves obtained from the quantum model   in the limit case of the large spin if we adopt as a hypothesis that all linear dependencies @xmath70 , see fig .",

    "@xmath66 the value @xmath47 persists up to the field @xmath57 , after that the concentration of @xmath84 jumps takes place in the narrow range @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the classical approach gives a rich variety of types of the magnetization curves .",
    "this prediction is corroborated by the numerical results obtained for the quantum model  , but an important exception must be made .",
    "the hamiltonian   commutes with the operator of the total spin projection @xmath86 , and the complete hilbert space of the problem decomposes into subspaces with fixed values of @xmath10 .",
    "the operator   projected onto these subspaces has the form of three - diagonal matrices whose eigenvalues can be numerically found using the qr - algorithm .",
    "another important simplification of the problem is possible because the zeeman term commutes with @xmath87 , and the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian  @xmath88 obtained for the case @xmath89 can be used for any field through the shift , @xmath90 .",

    "[ f : seps ] .",
    "the extent of this region in the direction of @xmath99 grows when the spin increases and arrives at the limit value @xmath100 , but its area decreases with @xmath2 .    for magnetization curves of the kind @xmath101 ,",
    "see figs .",
    "[ f : first - jumps ] and [ f : jumps](d ) , in the skew phase nonunit jumps are observed , that corresponds to the first - order transition @xmath102 in the limit case of large spins , but the classical theory predicts that this transition has a second order , and the region @xmath101 is absent .",
    "also the nonequidistantness of jumps with @xmath71 in the region of the concentration of jumps ( below the bold line in fig .",
    "[ f : first - jumps ] ) is observed , see fig .",
    "[ f : jumps](c ) .",
    "their merging is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : jumps](d ) . in the latter case that corresponds to the narrow region @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ f : first - jumps ] the magnetization process is the following : several first jumps have @xmath71 , then the jump with @xmath95 proceeds ( always one ) , and after that equidistant jumps with @xmath71 appear . in terms of the spin - flop analogue this behavior can be treated as that the transition @xmath103 is of the first order , which is impossible for the model given by the expression  .",
    "the more detailed structure of the region @xmath101 is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : pt ] for @xmath104 .",
    "parallelograms in the phase diagram @xmath76 , the region @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ f : first - jumps ] , corresponds to transitions from a state with @xmath105 to state with @xmath106 , @xmath95 . parallelograms with @xmath10 and @xmath107 is adjoint , and parallelograms with equals @xmath23 are attached at corners .",
    "this structure is responsible for the sawtooth shape of curves separating regions with @xmath108 in fig .",
    "[ f : pt ] . however , the isolines in this figure and the plot in the inset show that the value of the jump decreases rapidly removing from the line of separation states with @xmath71 and @xmath95 in the direction of negative @xmath99 values .",
    "thus , we find out a complicated behavior of the step - like magnetization curves for a pair of quantum spins with afm interaction and easy - plane anisotropy that depends on the two anisotropy constants with different origin .",
    "if the single - ion anisotropy prevails ,  merging  of unit jumps into the jump with @xmath95 can take place . in the opposite case , when the exchange anisotropy dominates ,",
    "all jumps are unit , but they are concentrated in a narrow field range .",
    "we reveal a qualitative similarity of the quantum problem and the corresponding classical one down to @xmath109 .",
    "these observations can be suitable as a starting point for the analysis of the experimental data ans studying the influence of other kinds of interactions , but it is far beyond this brief paper . at the same time , there are quantitative discrepancies between the classical system and the quantum one .",
    "these discrepancies are important in the range of the fields where the transition from @xmath71 to 2 occurs .",
    "the quantum effects that _ are free _ of a small value @xmath110 manifest themselves there . apparently , the explanation of this unexpected fact is associated with the follows : for the small anisotropy the quantum model has a singlet ground state that is strongly dissemble from the quasiclassical nel picture .",
    "thus , the region of a pure quantum behavior is revealed for the system in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "such effects are possible in the physics of antiferromagnetism .",
    "we mention the haldane hypothesis@xcite that the ground state of a quantum spin chain is different for integer and half - integer spin even in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the simple model of a spin pair considered above demonstrates that antiferromagnets can manifests substantially quantum properties even for large spins .",
