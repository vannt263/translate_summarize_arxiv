    "the gravitational lens system 0957 + 561 has by now been observed at optical and radio wavelengths for nearly twenty years ( walsh , carswell , and weymann 1979 ; porcas et al .",
    "radio studies have definitively established that the b / a magnification ratio of the lens , measured at the core of the radio images ( which lies at the location of the optical point source images ) , is close to 0.75 ; some recent measurements are @xmath1 ( garrett et al . 1994 ) , @xmath2 ( conner et al . , 1992 ) . note that while there is some controversy about the radio magnification ratio at the location of the radio jet , as opposed to the core ( see , e.g. , garrett et al .",
    "1994 ) , only the core value interests us here .    because the variability of the quasar in the optical is larger than in the radio , measurement of the b / a magnification ratio in the optical requires that the light curves be shifted by the correct time delay @xmath3 before the ratio is taken .",
    "thus , the earliest determinations of b / a were incorrect . for example , young et al .",
    "( 1980 ) obtained a ratio of 0.76 , comfortingly  yet erroneously ",
    "close to the radio magnification .",
    "however , at least from vanderriest et al .",
    "( 1989 ) on , who used a value for @xmath3 quite close to definitive recent determinations ( kundi et al .",
    "1997 ) , it has been clear that the b / a magnification ratio of the optical continuum in the b and a point sources is quite different from 0.75 , and moreover has remained at least fairly constant for the full history of observation . smoothing over observing seasons , vanderriest et al .",
    "( 1989 ) obtained a b / a ratio varying between about 0.9 and 1.05 over the observing seasons early-1980 through early-1986 ( times referenced to a component ) , with a single best - fit value of 0.97 .",
    "it is debatable whether the variation around the best - fit value is actual time variation of the lens magnification ratio ( as distinct from time variation in the quasar luminosity , n.b . ) or observational artifact .",
    "however , it does seem quite likely that the magnification ratio varied by no more than about @xmath4% during this time .",
    "more recently , the value recently obtained by kundi et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) for the 1995 season ( a component ) is @xmath5 in g - band ( with the error bar , a 95% confidence limit , depending somewhat on the method of reduction used ) .",
    "so , it is quite plausible ( and not contradicted by other measurements in the literature ) that the optical b / a remained in the range 0.9 to 1.12 from 1980 through 1995 , and possible that the variation has been considerably smaller than this range .",
    "the discrepancy between the optical and radio magnification ratios has long been understood as due to microlensing ( as predicted by chang and refsdal 1979 , and gott 1981 ) .",
    "the proper radius of the einstein ring from a 0.5 @xmath6 star at the lens galaxy redshift @xmath7 , illuminated by the quasar at redshift @xmath8 , is about @xmath9 cm .",
    "since the radio emission region is much larger than this scale , it averages spatially over the microlensing pattern and is magnified by the macrolens ratio of 0.75 .",
    "if the optical magnification indeed differs by @xmath10% from the macrolens value , then the optically emitting region must be smaller , or at most a few times larger , than the einstein ring scale .",
    "this accords nicely with ( e.g. ) the size of an accretion disk smaller than 100 schwarzschild radii around a @xmath11m@xmath12 black hole ( a scale of @xmath13 cm ) .",
    "this einstein ring radius is only marginally , however , in accord with the apparent constancy of the microlensed magnification ratio : since the earth , the microlensing star ( or stars , the effect being collective ) , and the quasar each have ( 3-dimensional ) peculiar velocities of at least 300 km / s , the earth should move through @xmath14% microlensing variations in @xmath15 yr ( see kochanek , kolatt , and bartelmann , 1996 for related calculations ) .",
    "so , the observed microlensing is about a factor 10 _ too constant _ , and one is invited to speculate on whether something other than luck is the reason .",
    "another invitation to speculation is the fact that kundi et al . obtain rather different magnification ratios in their r- and g - band data , with the r ratio being @xmath16 , with , again , the error bar depending on the method of analysis used . by any interpretation of the error bars , however , the r and g results are strongly discrepant .",
    "( again note that there is no assumption that the fluctuations themselves have the same amplitude in the two colors , but only that the magnification _ ratio",
    "_ should be the same . )",
    "either a full @xmath0 mag of r - band galaxy light has escaped kundi et al.s careful subtraction in the b image , or something else is going on in the lens magnification ratio .    with these two hovering peculiarities ( possible excess time - constancy , and possible non - achromaticity ) , it seems useful to try to get additional information on the magnification ratio .",
    "this paper therefore asks the questions : is the optical magnification ratio the same for the source region that produces the _ fluctuations _ in quasar light as it is for the source region that produces the _ constant _ light ? and",
    ", does the magnification ratio of the fluctuations ( which we may call the `` ac '' magnification ratio or `` acmr '' ) agree more closely with the r- or g - band magnification ratio previously measured ( here called the `` dc '' magnification ratio or `` dcmr '' ) ?    the answers to these questions can help diagnose the following situations : ( i ) if , as is true in many models , the size of the emitting region is much smaller than the microlensing scale , then all the magnification ratios should have the same value .",
    "( ii ) if there is a problem with r - band galaxy subtraction  or any other constant source of flux added to one lens component and not the other  then the acmr should represent the `` true '' microlens magnification ratio , and we might further expect it to be close to the g - band dcmr ( where galaxy subtraction is a much smaller effect ) .",
    "( iii ) if the optically emitting quasar accretion disk has a scale comparable to the microlensing scale , and has ( as seems almost inevitable ) color gradients , then the r and g acmrs , and r and g dcmrs , might all be distinct .",
    "indeed , the two acmrs and two dcmrs then provide four distinct windows on the convolution of the accretion disk source with the microlensing pattern .",
    "conceptually , one measures a dcmr and an acmr as follows : shift one of the light curves ( a , b ) in time by @xmath3 to undo the lens delay .",
    "fit each light curve by a constant value plus a residual time - varying part .",
    "the ratio of the constant values is the dcmr .",
    "now , for the two time - varying residuals , fit for a model that makes the b residual a constant times the a residual .",
    "the best - fitting constant is the acmr .    this conceptual formulation , while simple , is actually not quite right . in the next section",
    ", we will give a statistical formulation of the problem that is more complete , and also more directly applicable to unevenly sampled data .",
    "in section 3 , we discuss some implementation details , and in section 4 we apply the formulation to the published data of kundi et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "section 5 is discussion and conclusions .",
    "the spirit of this derivation is very much the same as described in rybicki and press ( 1992 , hereafter rp92 ) , which the reader might wish to consult at this point . for the purposes of calculation",
    ", we assume that the underlying fluctuating light curve is generated by a gaussian process @xmath17 .",
    "this is of course only an approximation , and we will comment in section 3 , below , on its limits of validity ; but the gaussian assumption provides a clean analytic framework . moreover , it is actually quite hard to find evidence for non - gaussianity in the 0957 + 561 light curve ( see press and rybicki , 1997 ) .",
    "the process @xmath17 is completely characterized by its covariance s(t_1,t_2 ) so that the @xmath18 of a series of ( for now , noiseless ) observations @xmath19 is ^2 = * f*^t * s*^-1 * f * where @xmath20 is the vector of @xmath21 values and @xmath22 is the matrix of @xmath23 values relating all pairs of times occuring in @xmath20 .",
    "the relative probability of a given sequence @xmath20 occuring is p(*f * ) ( ) ^-1/2 ( -12 ^ 2 )    we now model the observed a- and b - component light curves as @xmath24 here @xmath17 is a gaussian process , as above , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the ( assumed gaussian ) noise processes in the a and b measurements , respectively , and @xmath27 is the desired b / a magnification ratio , the acmr .",
    "( the dcmr would be @xmath28 . )    evidently @xmath29 and @xmath30 are gaussian processes . if @xmath31 is a vector of a measurements , @xmath32 is a vector of b measurements , then the @xmath18 value of a vector combining both measurements is immediately ^2 = (    c * a*-a_0 + * b*-b_0    ) ^t * m*^-1 (    c * a*-a_0 + * b*-b_0    ) where the matrix @xmath33 has the block - partitioned form = (    cc * s*_aa+*n*_a & r * s*_ab + r * s*_ba & r^2 * s*_bb+*n*_b    ) with @xmath34 and @xmath35 the noise covariances ( here and subsequently assumed to be diagonal ) , and the notation @xmath36 ( e.g. ) indicating a matrix of covariance values @xmath23 relating the times of a observations and the times of b observations .",
    "the associated gaussian probability , where we now emphasize the dependence on the unknown parameters , is p(*a*,*b * | a_0,b_0,r ) ( ) ^-1/2 ( -12 ^ 2 ) [ eq : seven ]    noting that = (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 & r    ) * c * (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 & r    ) where = (    cc * s*_aa+*n*_a & * s*_ab + * s*_ba & * s*_bb+*n*_b    ) we also have ^2 = (    c * a*-a_0 + r^-1*b*-r^-1b_0    ) ^t * c*^-1 (    c * a*-a_0 + r^-1*b*-r^-1b_0    ) [ eq : ten]and = r^2 m [ eq : tenprime]where @xmath37 is the length of the vector @xmath32 ( the number of b - component data points ) .",
    "we now arrive at a somewhat subtle , though important , issue : we do _ not _ want to assume that the fluctuating process @xmath17 has zero mean .",
    "indeed , physically , @xmath17 might be everywhere positive , since a process can emit positive photons but not negative ones .",
    "thus , in the context of equation ( [ eq : ten ] ) , we want to use an unbiased @xmath18 that is independent of moving some constant flux from @xmath17 and into @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( in correct proportion ) .",
    "rp92 showed how such a `` gauss - markov '' , unbiased process is obtained by adding a term @xmath40 to @xmath41 and then letting @xmath42 before calculating @xmath43 ( see rp92 for explanation of this notation ) .",
    "henceforth , we assume that this limit is always taken . in this case",
    ", @xmath18 becomes independent of any constant added to the vectors in the quadratic form , and equation ( [ eq : ten ] ) can be written as ^2 = (    c * a * + r^-1*b*-c_0    ) ^t * c*^-1 (    c * a * + r^-1*b*-c_0    ) [ eq : eleven]where c_0 r^-1b_0-a_0    the point is that , for fluctuations _ not _ known to have zero mean , the three parameters @xmath27 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , are not , even in principle , separately measurable .",
    "but the two parameters @xmath27 and @xmath44 _ are _ measurable .",
    "we refer to @xmath44 as the `` contamination '' , since in the ideal case that b alone is contaminated by spurious constant light ( for example , an unsubtracted component of the lens galaxy s light ) then @xmath45 represents the spurious flux .",
    "it is possible to separate , analytically , the contribution to @xmath18 of @xmath44 and @xmath27 , as follows : let (    c * a * + r^-1*b *    ) , (    c * 0 * + * e*_b    ) ( 0,0,  ,0,1,1,",
    " ,1)^t so that equation ( [ eq : eleven ] ) becomes ^2",
    "= ( * y * - c_0*q*)^t ( * y * - c_0*q * ) [ eq : twelve]straightforward matrix `` completion of the squares '' shows that equation ( [ eq : twelve ] ) is the same as ^2 = ( * q*^t ) ( c_0 - * q*^t ^t ) ^2 + * y*^t * h * * y * [ eq : thirteen]where - ^t^t [ eq : fourteen]the probability associated with equation ( [ eq : thirteen ] ) is ( using equations [ eq : seven ] and [ eq : tenprime ] ) p(*a*,*b * | r , c_0 ) ( r^2m)^-1/2 ( -12 ^ 2 ) [ eq : fifteen ]    equations ( [ eq : thirteen ] )  ( [ eq : fifteen ] ) could be used directly on data , to obtain ( e.g. ) maximum likelihood estimates of @xmath44 , which appears explicitly and only in one term , and @xmath27 , which appears implicitly only through @xmath46 .",
    "however , we want to take the more bayesian viewpoint that @xmath44 is a nuisance variable that ought to be integrated over , rather than maximized .",
    "( in practice , we find that @xmath44 is generally so well determined at fixed @xmath27 that it hardly matters whether we are bayesians or not . )",
    "bayes theorem now gives the simple result p(r | * a * , * b * ) _",
    "-^ dc_0 p(*a * , * b * | r , c_0 ) r^-m ( - ^t * h * * y * ) [ eq : sixteen]where , in the last equality , all constant factors that do not depend on @xmath27 have been dropped .",
    "the constant of proportionality is determined , in bayesian manner , by requiring that the integral of equation ( [ eq : fifteen ] ) over @xmath27 be unity",
    ". equation ( [ eq : fifteen ] ) is easily evaluated on a given data set @xmath47 for a range of values of @xmath27 , giving either bayesians probabilities or confidence intervals for @xmath27 , which is the ac magnification ratio ( acmr , see introduction ) .",
    "what about the dc magnification ratio ( dcmr ) ? from the above discussion , we now see that it is not directly measurable , without further assumption .",
    "the reason ( to reiterate ) is that some part of the light that is physically part of the fluctuating part , and might fluctuate in the future , may happen to be constant , or nearly so , over a finite data set .",
    "the closest thing to what the observer means by dcmr is obtained by setting @xmath44 to zero in equation ( [ eq : twelve ] ) and following equations .",
    "that is , the observer pre - corrects the data sets @xmath47 for all known constant sources of error ( galaxy light subtraction , and so on ) , then fits for the best single ratio @xmath27 that directly relates the a and b data sets .",
    "the bayesian probability corresponding to equation ( [ eq : sixteen ] ) is thus evidently , by equation ( [ eq : twelve ] ) , p(r | * a * , * b * ) r^-m ( - ^t ) [ eq : seventeen]we will see that this dcmr is generally much better determined statistically than is the acmr , but at the price of having unknown systematics ( in the pre - correction of the data ) .",
    "the acmr is much less well - determined , but is completely independent of such systematics .",
    "thus , there is a synergy in computing both magnification ratios by the unified formalism given here .",
    "we need to discuss how limiting is the original assumption of a gaussian process .",
    "the gaussian assumption enters in two ways : first , it provides an `` automatic '' means of interpolating across the time intervals between measured a and b data points ( which do nt in general line up after shifting one by @xmath3 ) .",
    "experience has shown ( also see press , rybicki , and hewitt 1992a , b ) that this use is quite robust  the interpolation is sensible and not very different from any other sensible method .",
    "second , the gaussian assumption is used in associating @xmath18 values ( and , more importantly @xmath48 values ) to probabilities .",
    "one should definitely be suspicious of this association in the tails of the distribution .",
    "if , however , one takes the resulting probability distributions as indicative of central value and uncertainty , rather than as correct in detail , then one is on relatively safer ground : the procedures described are essentially @xmath18 parameter estimations , and such estimations ( in the limit of large numbers of data points , when the central limit theorem can apply ) do not require any additional gaussian assumptions .    as in any @xmath18 parameter estimation ,",
    "the method is valid only if the error model is close to correct .",
    "a simple test to be passed is whether the values of @xmath18 in the exponentials of equations ( [ eq : sixteen ] ) and ( [ eq : seventeen ] ) are consistent with the number of data points , i.e. , whether the reduced @xmath18 is close to unity .",
    "when this is the case , we have found that additional fine tunings of the error model ( fiddling the functional form of the covariance in the matrix @xmath22 , or tradeoffs between adjusting the correlation model embodied in @xmath22 and the noise model embodied in @xmath49 ) have little effect on the output @xmath50 probability functions . if , however , the original reduced @xmath18 is not close to unity ( whether too low or too high ) , then any kind of rescaling procedure must be viewed as introducing unknown biases into the method given here .    indeed , the reason that we restrict ourselves , in the next section , to the data of kundi et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) is that for other data sets ( e.g. , vanderriest et al .",
    "1989 ) we have not been able to formulate a satisfactory and self - consistent error model ( @xmath22 and @xmath49 matrices ) .    a final technical note is to point out that the calculations implied by equations ( [ eq : sixteen ] ) and ( [ eq : seventeen ] ) can all be done using the `` fast methods '' for inverting @xmath51 matrices described by rybicki and press ( 1995 ) .",
    "these fast methods restrict the correlation model to a particular functional form , basically requiring the correlation structure function to be a linear function of lag time .",
    "however , this approximation appears to be adequate for the 0957 + 561 data , at least for these purposes , and the resulting reduction in computation time is enormous , and would become essential for very large data sets .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of applying the analysis described in the previous two sections to the data set published by kundi et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "first we convert the data and error bars from magnitudes to fluxes @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "next , we use the a component light curves ( separately in the g and r colors ) to estimate a structure function @xmath54 ^ 2 \\right>$ ] .",
    "next , we use this structure function , along with the errors , to construct the @xmath22 and @xmath49 matrices appropriate for the `` fast '' method ( rybicki and press , 1995 ) .",
    "it is at this stage that the gauss - markov ( unbiased ) limit is taken ( see discussion before equation [ eq : eleven ] , above ) .",
    "the upper panel of the figure plots @xmath50 as a function of @xmath27 for both the dcmr ( equation [ eq : seventeen ] ; plotted as the `` narrow '' distributions ) and the acmr ( equation [ eq : sixteen ] ; plotted as the `` broad '' distributions ) . in each case",
    ", the results for the g - band data are shown as solid curves , while the r - band data is shown as dotted curves .",
    "our dcmr values closely reproduce the b / a flux ratios quoted by kundi et al . in both",
    "the r and g bands , and our errors ( widths of curves shown ) are comparable to the latter s quoted errors .",
    "our acmr values  novel to this work  are seen to be compatible , in both g and r , with the g - band dcmr .",
    "although there is no strict incompatibility among all four values ( except the two dcmrs , as previously remarked ) the distributions in figure 1 tend to support the conclusion that the r - band dcmr is `` odd man out '' .",
    "the lower panel in figure 1 shows how many magnitudes of contamination ( relative to the time - average flux ) would need to be present in the b image to move the dcmr peak from its plotted location to any other location . by definition ,",
    "the curves go through zero at the dcmr peak centers .",
    "one sees that about @xmath0 mag is required in r - band to shift the dcmr to compatibility with g - band ; however , even without shifting , the r - band dcmr is at least marginally compatible with the r - band acmr .",
    "while these data , in this analysis , do not support any very definitive conclusions , we may make the following remarks :    occam s razor would seem to indicate that the r - band light curve of kundi et al",
    ". has about @xmath0 mag of residual , unsubtracted , constant light , as perhaps from unmodeled small - scale variations in the lens galaxy surface brightness .",
    "if this is the case , then all the data are compatible with a single magnification ratio for both colors and for both the fluctuating and constant pieces .",
    "this in turn suggests an accretion disk scale much smaller than the microlensing scale , in accord with theoretical prejudice .",
    "the utility of the acmrs is that , taken together , they strongly favor the hypothesis that the g - band magnification ratio is the correct one , and that nothing more exotic is going wrong .",
    "we note , however ( per e. turner , private communication ) , that the galaxy g1 is something like 2 magnitudes fainter than component b in r band ; thus the amount of unsubtracted light would need to be comparable to the total brightness of g1 , which seems quite unlikely .",
    "it is up to the observers , not us , to decide whether occam s razor should rule in this case . if @xmath0 mag of residual is not possibly present",
    ", then we must conclude that the accretion disk scale is comparable to the microlensing scale , and that the constant r - band part of the disk is _ more _ strongly magnified than ( at least some of ) the other three regions .",
    "it seems likely on physical grounds that the fluctuating regions should be smaller than the constant regions , and that the g - band regions should be smaller than the r - band regions ( temperature decreasing outward in the disk ) . for the larger ( r - band and constant ) region to have a higher magnification ratio than an enclosed smaller region",
    ", the larger region must extend to a place where the magnification is a superlinear function of position in the sky .",
    "this might indicate at least a fair chance of the b image passing through a caustic in the near ( @xmath15 year ) future .",
    "this possibility , as well as the reconciliation of the relative constancy of the magnification ratio over the last 15 years , will be explored by monte carlo simulations in another paper ( press and kochanek , in preparation ) .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf grant phy-9507695 at harvard , and phy-9513835 at the institute for advanced study , whose hospitality is acknowledged .",
    "we thank chris kochanek , ed turner , ramesh narayan , and paul schechter for helpful discussions ."
