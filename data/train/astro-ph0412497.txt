    "weak gravitational lensing is the small distortion , or shearing , of the images of distant galaxies by the bending of light due to the potentials associated with density fluctuations along the line of sight .",
    "this means that the lensing effect on galaxy shapes depends on large scale structure and its evolution over a long period of time , making weak gravitational lensing a potentially very useful tool to teach us about cosmology in general and the formation of structures in particular .",
    "although most recent investigations focus on using the statistical properties of the lensing field to learn about cosmology , lensing might also be used to determine the masses of individual dark matter halos . for a recent review of the status of weak lensing research",
    ", we refer to @xcite or @xcite .    naively , lensing offers a way to find the mass of halos because the strength of the shear is proportional to the mass along the line of sight . unfortunately ,",
    "lensing is caused by all mass along the line of sight , not just by the particular halo we want to find the mass of .",
    "this projection effect of density fluctuations along the line of sight is known to be considerable @xcite , which makes it hard to derive the mass of a halo from the lensing field directly . however ,",
    "if we have additional information about the mass along the line of sight , we may be able to correct for its effect , at least partly ( we refer to @xcite for a more statistical approach to correcting for line - of - sight projection ) .",
    "one way of getting this information is to use deep optical data , that we need anyway to detect background source galaxies , to find halos by applying modern cluster finding methods ( see for example @xcite on rcs and @xcite on sdss ) .",
    "more specifically , halos can be located by looking for groups of galaxies , using the fact that galaxies tend to trace the dark matter distribution .",
    "if we then correct for the lensing effect of these line - of - sight halos , we might be able to retrieve the lensing signal caused purely by the particular halo of interest , which is a measure of its mass .",
    "knowledge of halo masses would be very useful from a cosmological point of view because it can be used to construct the mass function , which would help us to provide better constraints on cosmological parameters such as the equation of state of the dark energy @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will investigate to what extent we can correct for line - of - sight projection effects in the lensing field and we will show that it is unlikely that the lensing field can be used to determine individual halo masses with a higher accuracy than the 10% level . in section [ sec : model ] , we will discuss the theory and the practical aspects of our analysis .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we will analyze the method described above by considering lensing maps based on simulations of structure formation .",
    "we first discuss these simulations and how they are used to calculate lensing fields in section [ subsec : sim ] .",
    "these fields will play the role of the observed data . to find out if we can correct for the lensing effect of line - of - sight halos and use the lensing field to find halo masses , we will use information about the positions and masses of these halos together with a model for their density profiles to calculate their contributions to the measured field .",

    "the basis for the lensing maps is a high resolution n - body simulation of structure formation in a @xmath0cdm universe which was run using the treepm code described in @xcite .",

    "the softening was of a spline form with plummer equivalent smoothing @xmath8kpc , fixed in comoving coordinates .",
    "the simulation was started at a redshift @xmath9 when density fluctuations on the relevant scales were still in the linear regime . between @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "the particle distribution was dumped every @xmath12mpc .    for each output we produced a halo catalog by running a `` friends - of - friends '' ( fof ) group finder ( e.g.  @xcite ) with a linking length @xmath13 in units of the mean inter - particle spacing .",
    "this procedure partitions the particles into equivalence classes , by linking together all particle pairs separated by less than a distance @xmath14 .",
    "this means that fof halos are bounded by a surface of density roughly @xmath15 times the background density .",
    "more than half of all the particles are unclustered and are assigned to the `` no group '' category .",
    "note that since simulated dark matter clusters do not have clear boundaries , our definition ( and any other practical definition for that matter ) excludes a small part of each cluster from the fof cluster .",
    "the halo mass is estimated as the sum of the masses of the particles in the fof halo , times a small correction factor ( typically 10% ) which provides the best fit to the sheth - tormen mass function @xcite .",
    "the resulting catalog contains the angular position in the sky , the redshift and the mass for each halo .",
    "since the typical source distance is a lot bigger than the box size ( for a source redshift @xmath16 the distance is about @xmath17mpc ) , we place a number of boxes in a row to get the complete matter distribution between @xmath11 and @xmath18 within a field of view of @xmath19",
    ". the origin of each box is chosen at random in order to prevent tracing through the same structure more than once .",
    "as a measure for the lensing effect , we focus on the convergence @xmath20 because this is an easy quantity to work with . while it is possible to use a full ray tracing algorithm @xcite to compute @xmath20 from the simulations , we used a simpler approach , based on the born approximation , which should be more than adequate for our purposes @xcite .",
    "the born approximation gives @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the overdensity , @xmath23 is the scale - factor and @xmath24 is the comoving distance .",

    "we must assume a certain density profile for each line - of - sight halo .",
    "the density profile we use in our model is the nfw distribution ( navarro , frenk & white 1997,1996,1995 ) .",
    "previous simulations of structure formation have shown that most dark matter halos roughly follow this profile , which is given by :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the distance to the halo center and @xmath30 is the critical density at the redshift @xmath31 of the halo .",

    "this brings us to the second problem . in reality",
    "we will have to use a model for the shapes of halos .",

    "finally , in section [ subsec : galcounts ] the use of galaxy counts to find the masses of line - of - sight halos has been taken into account .",
    "we conclude that it is very difficult to use the tangential shear to calculate masses of individual halos with high accuracy and it is unlikely that any other measure of the lensing field _ can _ be used for this purpose",
    ". an interesting future project would be to investigate the more statistical approach of comparing predictions of the shear ( or an other observable measure of the lensing field ) as a function of halo mass from simulations to measured lensing fields around a large sample of halos to find the number of halos per mass range .",
    "while it has never been demonstrated that high accuracy calibration of the shear - mass relation is possible using simulations , there is in principle no obstacle to this route . of course , using simulations to calibrate observations , rather than test algorithms , is more demanding of the theory .",
