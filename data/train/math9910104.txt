    "in recent work @xcite , m. kontsevich has established a remarkable result on the formality of the hochschild complex of a smooth manifold . an important consequence of this result is an explicit construction of an associative @xmath1-product on an arbitrary smooth poisson manifold @xmath7 .",

    "indeed , if @xmath216 , the corresponding bidifferential operator @xmath217 is automatically @xmath16 .",
    "next , let @xmath166 and @xmath168 be two polynomials on @xmath205 with @xmath218 , @xmath219 .",

    "hence @xmath227    this sum is finite , and if we set @xmath12 , we obtain a polynomial on @xmath205 of degree @xmath221 .",
    "therefore , kontsevich s @xmath228-product descends to an _ actual product _ on the algebra of polynomial functions on @xmath205 , which can be naturally identified with the symmetric algebra @xmath229 .",
    "let @xmath230 and @xmath231 be the weyl algebras of polynomial coefficient differential operators on @xmath0 and @xmath205 respectively .",
