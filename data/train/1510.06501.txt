    "phishing webpages ( `` phishs '' ) lure unsuspecting web surfers into revealing their credentials . as a major security concern on the web ,",
    "phishing has attracted the attention of many researchers and practitioners .",
    "there is a wealth of literature , tools and techniques for helping web surfers to detect and avoid phishing webpages .",
    "nevertheless , phishing detection remains an arms race with no definitive solution .",
    "state - of - the - art large scale real - time phishing detection techniques  @xcite are capable of identifying phishing webpages with high accuracy ( > 99% ) while achieving very low rates of misclassifying legitimate webpages ( < 0.1% ) .",
    "however , many of these techniques , which use machine learning , rely on millions of static features , primarily taking the bag - of - words approach .",
    "this implies two major weaknesses : ( a ) they need a huge amount of labeled data to train their classification models ; and ( b ) they are language- and brand - dependent and not very effective at identifying new phishing webpages targeting brands that were not already observed in previous attacks .",
    "commercial providers of phishing detection solutions struggle with obtaining and maintaining labeled training data . from the deployability perspective ,",
    "solutions that require minimal training data are thus very attractive .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new approach that avoids these drawbacks .",
    "our goal is to identify whether a given webpage is a phish , and , if it is , identify the _ target _ it is trying to mimic .",
    "our approach is based on two core conjectures :    * * modeling phisher limitations * : to increase their chances of success , phishers try to make their phish mimic its target closely and obscure any signal that might tip off the victim .",
    "however , in crafting the structure of the phishing webpage , phishers are restricted in two significant ways .",
    "first , external hyperlinks in the phishing webpage , especially those pointing to the target , are to domains _ outside the control _ of phishers .",
    "second , while phishers can freely change most parts of the phishing page , the latter part of its domain name is _ constrained _ as they are limited to domains that the phishers control .",
    "we conjecture that by modeling these limitations in our phishing detection classifier , we can improve its effectiveness . * * measuring consistency in term usage * : a webpage can be represented by a collection of key terms that occur in multiple parts of the page such as its body text , title , domain name , other parts of the url etc .",
    "we conjecture that the way in which these terms are used in different parts of the page will be different in legitimate and phishing webpages .    based on these conjectures ,",
    "we develop and evaluate a phishing detection system .",
    "we use comparatively few ( 212 ) but relevant features .",
    "this allows our system , even with very little labeled training data , to have high accuracy and low rate of mislabeling legitimate websites . by modeling inherent phisher limitations in our feature set , the system is resilient to adaptive attackers who dynamically change a phish to circumvent detection .",
    "our basic phishing detector component ( section  [ sec : classification ] ) does not require online access to centralized information and is fast .",
    "therefore , it is highly suited for a privacy - friendly client - side implementation .",
    "our target brand identification component ( section  [ sec : target ] ) uses a simple technique to extract a set of _ keyterms _ characterizing a webpage and , in case it is a phish , uses the keyterms set to identify its target .",
    "both components eschew the bag - of - words approach and are thus not limited to specific languages or targeted brands .",
    "we claim the following contributions :    * a new set of features to detect phishing webpages ( section  [ subsec : feat_comp ] ) and a classifier , using these features , with the following properties that distinguish it from previous work : * * it learns a generalized model of phishing and legitimate webpages from * a small training set * ( few thousands ) . * * it is * language- and brand - independent*. * * it is resilient to adaptive attackers . * * its features are extracted only from information retrieved by a web browser from the webpage and it does not require online access to centralized information . hence it * admits a client - side - only implementation * that offers several advantages including ( a ) better privacy , ( b ) real - time protection and ( c ) resilient to phishing webpages that return different contents to different clients . * comprehensive evaluation of this system , showing that its accuracy ( > 99% ) and misclassification rate ( < 0.1% ) are comparable to prior work while using significantly smaller training data .",
    "( section  [ subsec : exp_classif ] ) * a fast target identification technique ( section  [ sec : target ] ) for phishing webpages with accuracy ( 90 - 97% ) comparable to previously reported techniques . it can also be used to remove false positives from the basic phishing detection component described above .",
    "( section  [ subsec : target_eval ] )    this research report is an extended version of an icdcs 2016 paper @xcite .",
    "a proof of concept of this technique has been implemented as a phishing prevention browser add - on @xcite",
    "phishing refers to the class of attacks where a victim is lured to a fake webpage masquerading as a target website and is deceived into disclosing personal data or credentials .",
    "phishing campaigns are typically conducted using spam emails to drive users to fake websites @xcite .",
    "impersonation techniques range from technical subterfuges ( email spoofing , dns spoofing , etc . ) to social engineering .",
    "the former is used by technically skilled phishers while unskilled phishers resort to the latter  @xcite .",
    "phishing webpages mimic the look and feel of their target websites  @xcite . in order to make the phishing webpages believable",
    ", phishers may embed some content ( html code , images , etc . )",
    "taken directly from the target website and use relatively little content that they themselves host @xcite .",
    "this includes outgoing links pointing to the target website .",
    "they also use keywords referring to the target in different elements of the phishing webpage ( title , text , images , links )  @xcite . in this paper , our focus is on detection of phishing webpages created by an attacker and hosted on his own web server or on someone else s compromised web server .",
    "webpages are addressed by a uniform resource locator ( url ) .",

    "the url may also have a _ path _ and _ query _ components which , too , can be changed by the phisher at will .",
    "we use the term _ freeurl _ to refer to those parts of the url that are fully controllable by the phisher .",

    "/ signin?_encoding = utf8 _ }      from analyzing phishing webpages , we identify the following data sources , available to a web browser when it loads a webpage , that can be useful in detecting phishing webpages :    * _ starting url _ : the url given to the user to access the website .",
    "it can be distributed in emails , instant messages , websites , documents , etc . * _ landing url _ : the final url pointing to the actual content presented to the user in his web browser .",
    "this is the url present in the browser address bar when the page is completely loaded . *",
    "_ redirection chain _ : the set of urls crossed to go from the starting url to the landing url ( including both ) . * _ logged links _ : the set of urls logged by the browser while loading the page .",
    "they point to sources from which embedded content ( code , images , etc . ) in the webpage are loaded . *",
    "_ html _ : the html source code of the webpage and iframes included in the page .",
    "we consider four elements extracted from this source code : * * _ text _ : text contained between _ < body > _ html tags ( actually rendered on user s display ) . * * _ title _ : text contained between _",
    "< title > _ html tags ( appears in the browser tab title ) .",
    "* * _ href links _",
    ": the set of urls representing outgoing links in the webpage . * * _ copyright _ : the copyright notice , if any , in text . *",
    "_ screenshot _ : an image capture of the loaded webpage .",
    "before describing the detailed design ( in sections  [ sec : classification ] and [ sec : target ] ) , we start with an overview .      in section  [ subsec : url_structure ] , we saw that even on systems they control , phishers are constrained from freely constructing urls to pages they host .",
    "similarly , in section  [ subsec : phishing ] , we saw that in order to maximize the believability of their phishing sites , phishers include content from urls outside their control .",
    "we conjecture that by taking these constraints and level of control into account in selecting and grouping features for our classification , we can improve classification performance .",
    "thus , we divide the data sources from section [ subsec : data_source ] into subcategories according to the level of _ control _ phishers may have on them and the _ constraints _ on phishers .",
    "* control * : urls from _ logged links _ and _ href links _ are subdivided into _ internal _ and _ external _ according to their _ rdn_. the set of _ _",
    "rdn__s extracted from urls involved in the redirection chain are assumed to be under the control of the webpage owner .",
    "any urls that include these _ _ rdn__s are marked _",
    "internal_. other _ _ rdn__s are assumed to be possibly outside the control of the webpage owner .",
    "urls containing such _",
    "_ rdn__s are marked _",
    "external_.    * constraints * : within a url , we distinguish between _ rdn _ , which can not be freely defined by the webpage owner , and ( _ freeurl _ ) , which can be .",
    "the primary technique of a phisher is essentially social engineering : fooling a victim into believing that the phishing webpage is the target  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is plausible that lexical analysis of the data sources will help in identifying phishing webpages : we conjecture that legitimate webpages and phishing webpages differ in the way terms are used in _ different locations _ in those pages . to incorporate measurements of such term usage consistency ,",
    "we first define what `` terms '' are and how they are extracted from a webpage .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of the 26 lowercase english letters : @xmath1 .",
    "we extract terms from a data source as follows :    * canonicalize letter characters by mapping upper case characters , accented characters and special characters to a matching letter in @xmath0 ; e.g. , _ \\ { b , @xmath2 , b , b } _ @xmath3 . * split the input into substrings whenever a character @xmath4 is encountered .",
    "* throw away any substring whose length is less than 3 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the set of all possible terms .",
    "suppose @xmath6 was extracted from a data source @xmath7 and @xmath8 occurs with probability @xmath9 .",

    "* phishing webpage detection : * analysis of the content @xcite and code execution ( _ e.g. _ the use of javascript , pop - up windows , etc . )",
    "@xcite of a webpage provides relevant information to identify phishing webpages .",
    "some detection methods rely on url lexical obfuscation characteristics @xcite and webpage hosting related features @xcite to render a decision about the legitimacy of a webpage .",
    "the visual similarity of a phishing webpage with its target was also exploited to detect phishs @xcite .",
    "phishing detection based on visual similarity presuppose that a potential target is known a priori .",
    "in contrast , our approach is to discover the target .",
    "multi - criteria methods @xcite have been proved the most efficient to detect phishing websites .",
    "these techniques use a combination of webpage features ( html terms , links , frame , etc . ) , connection features ( html header , redirection , etc . ) and host based features ( dns , ip , asn , geolocation , etc . ) to infer webpage legitimacy .",
    "they are implemented as offline systems checking content pointed by urls to automatically build blacklists .",
    "this process induces a delay of several hours @xcite that is problematic in the context of phishing detection , since phishing attacks have a median lifetime of a few hours @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is reportedly costly @xcite and use @xcite some proprietary features preventing usage on the end - user devices .",
    "the identification method uses machine learning techniques fed with hundreds of thousands of features .",
    "these features are mostly static and learned from training sets containing data such as ip address , autonomous system number ( asn ) , bag - of - words for different data sources ( webpage , url , etc . ) .",
    "this limits the generalizability of the approach as it requires large training datasets , numbering hundreds of thousand of webpages @xcite .",
    "other methods focused , as we do , on the study of terms that compose the data sources of a webpage @xcite .",
    "cantina @xcite was among the first systems to propose a lexical analysis of terms that compose a webpage .",
    "in cantina @xcite key terms are selected using tf - idf to provide a unique signature of a webpage . using this signature in a search engine , cantina infers the legitimacy of a webpage . a similar method @xcite , based on tf - idf and google search , checks for inconsistency between a webpage identity and the identity it impersonates to identify phish .",
    "the main difference between these methods and ours is language independence since these methods rely on tf - idf computation to infer their keyterms .",
    "table [ tab : compare ] presents comparative performances results of our phishing detection system to the most relevant state - of - the - art systems .",
    "it presents the size of the testing sets used to evaluate each system and the provenance of the legitimate set , showing how representative the set is .",
    "for example , using popular websites ( such as top alexa sites )  @xcite as the legitimate set is not representative .",
    "the ratio of training to testing instances indicates the scalability of the method and the ratio of legitimate to phishing instances shows the extent to which the experiments represents a real world distribution ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "we also identify the evaluation method ( e.g. , cross validation vs. training with old data and testing with new data ) .",
    "finally , we present several metrics for assessing the classification performance . if data for any of the columns were missing from the original paper describing the system , we estimated them . for comparison purposes , if several experimental setups were proposed in a paper , we selected the most relevant to assess their practical efficacy using the following ordered criteria :    1 .",
    "learning and testing instances are different , 2 .",
    "the ratio of legitimate to phishing in the testing set is representative of real world observations ( @xmath13 ) , 3 .",
    "the learning set is older than the testing set , 4 .",
    "the false positive rate ( fpr ) is minimized .",
    "we can see that among the eight most relevant state - of - the - art techniques , only two @xcite have comparable false positive rates to ours ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "a low false positive rate is paramount for a phishing detection technique , since this relates to the proportion of legitimate webpages to which a user will be incorrectly denied .",
    "the technique proposed by ma _",
    "@xcite has a lower accuracy than in our system ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "in addition , they use a testing set that does not represent real world distribution ( 3 legs/4 phishs ) and use a cross - validation that does not assess scalability of the approach with a 1/1 ratio for learning to testing instances .",
    "@xcite report results similar to us in several metrics .",
    "however , they use a _ huge training set ( > 9 m instances ) _ and their test set is actually _ smaller _ than the training set ( a sixth , at 1.5 m ) ! scalability and language / brand independence are likely to be poor since they use 100,000 mostly static features ( bag - of - words ) .",
    "in contrast to the state - of - the - art in phishing detection , our solution is language independent , scalable , requires much smaller training sets than test sets , and does not rely on real - time access to external sources , while performing better than or as well as the state - of - the - art .    *",
    "target identification : * one proposal @xcite was to use a similar technique as cantina with keywords retrieval and google search to discover a list of potential target as the top results of the search , but the authors do not report accuracy figures for target identification .",
    "href links have been used to build community graphs of webpages . by counting the mutual links between two webpages and further performing visual similarity analysis between suspicious webpages , liu _",
    "@xcite identify the target of a given phishing website with an accuracy of 92.1% .",
    "however , this technique is slow because of the need to crawl many additional websites to build the community graph .",
    "conditional random fields and latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) @xcite have been applied to phishing email content to identify their target @xcite with a success rate of 88.1% .",
    "the technique we propose , in contrast to previous techniques is language independent for keyterms inference .",
    "it is as efficient as any state - of - the - art solutions achieving a maximum success rate of 90.5 - 97.3% .",
    "we presented novel techniques for efficiently and economically identifying phishing webpages and their targets . by using a set of features that capture inherent limitations that phishers face ,",
    "our system has excellent performance and scalability while requiring much smaller amounts of training data .",
    "we have also implemented a fully client - side phishing prevention browser add - on implementing this technique  @xcite .",
    "this work was supported in part by the academy of finland ( grant 274951 ) and intel collaborative research center for secure computing ( icri - sc ) .",
