    "before experimental discovery of charmed hadrons at accelerators in the mid-1970s there was intense interest in using atmospheric muons to find evidence for production of heavy , short - lived hadrons .",
    "for example , a highlight of the 1973 cosmic - ray conference at denver was an update of measurements made over several years with the underground muon spectrometer at park city , utah  @xcite . at first",
    ", the observed angular dependence of multi - tev muons had appeared to be more isotropic than could be explained solely by production through the pion and kaon channels , which are strongly enhanced at large zenith angles . with an improved understanding of the overburden and the detector response ,",
    "however , it was finally concluded that the park city data were consistent a  conventional \" origin from decay of pions and kaons .",
    "an isotropic  prompt \" component was not manifest for energies below @xmath2  tev .",
    "production of charmed hadrons has now been measured over a large range of energy at accelerators .",
    "the production cross section increases significantly from approximately @xmath3b at @xmath4  gev to several  mb at @xmath5  tev  @xcite .",
    "there is still not full coverage of phase space for charm production , however . in particular",
    ", the level of `` intrinsic '' charm  @xcite production is still uncertain .",
    "the selex measurement  @xcite shows a large asymmetry in the ratio of charm to anti - charm baryons produced by baryon beams on a fixed target , while little or no asymmetry is observed in a pion beam .",
    "this observation indicates some level of intrinsic charm in which the valence quarks of the projectile pick up a charmed quark .",
    "charmed hadrons produced as fragments of the incident nucleon beam will contribute disproportionately to the spectrum of atmospheric leptons because of the steep cosmic - ray energy spectrum .",
    "thus , even if intrinsic charm contributes less to the total cross section for producing charm than production via qcd processes , it may have a significant effect on the prompt contribution to atmospheric muons and neutrinos .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic interest in identifying the charm contribution to the fluxes of atmospheric muons and neutrinos , there is another , perhaps more important , reason for trying to measure this component .",
    "that is because of the relevance of prompt neutrinos in the search for neutrinos of astrophysical origin . like a flux from unresolved extra - galactic neutrino sources ,",
    "the prompt contribution is isotropic for @xmath6  gev .",
    "it is also harder by one power of energy than the spectrum of conventional atmospheric neutrinos . for these reasons ,",
    "prompt neutrinos constitute an important background for neutrino astronomy .",
    "the paper begins in   [ sec2 ] with a discussion of the ingredients needed to calculate fluxes of atmospheric muons and neutrinos , including relevant analytic approximations and the primary cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] reviews models for charm production and corresponding predictions for fluxes of muons and neutrinos . in   [ sec4 ] we calculate the fluxes of conventional atmospheric muons and neutrinos and compare them with the charm contribution .",
    "the effect of the knee of the primary spectrum is included .",
    "the predictions are illustrated in ",
    "[ sec5 ] with approximate calculations of the event rates for detector with a gigaton target volume like icecube  @xcite .",
    "the concluding section  [ sec6 ] comments on the current status and prospects for detection of prompt leptons in the near future .",
    "the two main ingredients in the calculation of atmospheric neutrinos are the primary spectrum and the hadronic physics of meson production in hadronic interactions . because production of pions , kaons and charmed hadrons occurs at the nucleon level",
    ", what is most relevant is the primary spectrum of nucleons per gev / nucleon .",
    "composition comes in through the ratio of protons to total nucleons , which determines the charge ratio of muons and particle / anti - article ratio for neutrinos .      for illustration",
    "i use a phenomenological model of the primary spectrum with three populations of particles and five nuclear components  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left ) .",
    "there are two basic assumptions .",
    "first , it is assumed that all energy dependence ( whether from acceleration or propagation ) depends only on how particles are affected by their magnetic environment . as a consequence , each nuclear component",
    "( mass number @xmath7 and total momentum per particle @xmath8 ) depends on magnetic rigidity ( @xmath9 ) in the same way , where @xmath10 .",
    "peters  @xcite pointed out the consequence of this assumption for the primary composition in the region of the knee of the spectrum , namely , that , when expressed in terms of total energy per particle , protons would steepen first followed by helium and then by nuclei with successively higher charge .",
    "the other assumption , following hillas  @xcite , is that three populations of particles are sufficient to characterize the entire cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "this is almost certainly an oversimplification .",
    "a more realistic picture would likely involve many individual sources injecting particles at various distances and times , as in the model for galactic cosmic rays of blasi and amato  @xcite .",
    "thus the three populations represent three classes of sources :    1 .",
    "particles accelerated by supernova remnants in the galaxy , 2",
    ".   a higher energy galactic component of uncertain origin , and 3 .",
    "particles accelerated at extra - galactic sources .",

    ", the spectral index is the same as that of the primary spectrum of nucleons , but at high energy the spectrum of the decaying pions is one power steeper because of the competition between decay and reinteraction .",
    "low and high are with respect to the critical energy @xmath18 .",
    "the ratio @xmath19 .",
    "the forms for two - body decay of charged kaons are the same , but the mass ratio factor is much smaller : @xmath20 .",
    "the larger critical energy for charged kaons leads to an increase in the contribution of kaons with increasing energy for both muons and neutrinos .",
    "the differences between the kinematic factors for two - body decay to neutrinos and muons amplifies the importance of the kaon channel for neutrinos . at high energy , in the tev range and above , charged kaons account for about 80% of muon neutrinos as compared to 25% of muons .",
    "each term in eq .",
    "[ angular ] is a form that combines the low energy and high energy solutions to the cascade equation respectively for pions , kaons and charmed hadrons in the atmosphere .",
    "the numerator is a product of the spectrum weighted moment for meson production and the spectrum weighted moment of the decay distribution to @xmath21  @xcite with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the integral spectral index of the spectrum of primary nucleons .",
    "the denominator governs the transition between the low and the high energy regimes .",
    "the forms for muons are similar . for low energy ,",
    "meson decay dominates over reinteraction and the resulting lepton spectrum has the same shape as the primary spectrum of nucleons .",
    "charmed hadrons are in the low - energy regime for @xmath24  gev",
    ". for high energy ( @xmath25 ) , reinteraction of the hadron is more likely and the lepton spectrum becomes one power of energy steeper than the primary spectrum .    in the high energy limit , the spectrum weighted moment for meson decay has to be evaluated on the steeper spectrum , and the attenuation lengths for reinteraction come into play .",
    "the @xmath26 quantities in the denominators are the product of the ratios of low - energy to high energy decay distributions combined with the function of attenuation lengths that accounts for cascading of the mesons  @xcite .",
    "explicitly , for neutrinos @xmath27 and for muons @xmath28 the forms for kaons are the same as functions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath23 on energy in the case of a non - power law primary spectrum needs to be accounted for .    for a power - law primary spectrum of nucleons and assuming feynman scaling for hadron production , the cascade equations can be solved analytically as in eq .",
    "[ angular ] .",
    "the primary spectrum can always be described locally as a power law , and similarly the hadronic interactions can be written in terms of the scaled energy ( @xmath31 ) for a given primary energy per nucleon . in both cases",
    "the dependence on energy is sufficiently gradual that the approximate analytical forms can be used for quantitative calculations if the slow variation with energy is accounted for .",
    "this approach is taken in the calculation of thunman , ingelmann and gondolo ( tig )  @xcite , which i follow here .",
    "they define energy - dependent z - factors as in the following example for nucleons producing charged pions : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the nucleon interaction length and d@xmath34 is the number of charged pions produced in d@xmath13 by nucleons of energy @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the spectrum of nucleons .",
    "the energy - dependent z - factors are then used in applicable version of eq .",
    "[ angular ] to evaluate the lepton spectrum .",
    "this approximation is valid to the extent that the energy dependences are gradual .",
    "they showed that the numerical approximation based on the spectrum weighted moments taken from the interaction model used in their monte carlo produced similar results to the full monte carlo .",
    "the advantage is that the analytic approximations can be tuned to match well to a particular model of hadronic interactions .",
    "they can then be used to extend a monte carlo calculation to arbitrarily high energies without the statistical problems that arise from the fact that mesons usually interact rather than decay at high energy .",
    "this method has been used recently in ref .",
    "@xcite to complement monte carlo calculations of atmospheric leptons in the region of the knee of the cosmic - ray spectrum .",

    "figure  [ fig2 ] compares the predictions of these three models for the prompt contribution to the atmospheric muon flux .",
    "an important point to note in comparing the curves in this figure is that the spectrum also depends on what is assumed for the primary spectrum .",

    "@xcite is taken from a model  @xcite in which the knee is attributed to energy losses in the sources ( photo - disintegration for nuclei and photo - pion production for nuclei . in this case , the knee is a function of @xmath60 rather than rigidity for the nuclei , and the knee occurs at higher energy per nucleon for protons than for helium because of the relatively high threshold for photo - pion production as compared to photo - disintegration .",

    "i take account of the knee in the spectrum , and i make a preliminary effort to present a consistent representation of the prompt component by rescaling their fluxes to the same spectrum of nucleons used for the conventional leptons , as described in the previous paragraph .    since the primary spectrum is no longer a power law ,",

    "in view of the recent observation by icecube of two cascade - like events with observed energy just above a pev  @xcite , together with the observation of several high = energy cascades reported at this meeting  @xcite , it is important to achieve a good understanding of the background from atmospheric neutrinos in the energy region around 100 tev and above .",
    "the work outlined in this paper is just a start .",
    "there are large uncertainties in the primary spectrum in the tev range and above that need to be assessed .",

    "the analytic approximations will remain an important tool to supplement the monte carlo , for example to track the consequences of uncertainties in the input spectrum and hadronic interactions for the expected fluxes  @xcite , as well as to parameterize and extrapolate the limited statistics of the full monte carlo  @xcite .",

    "<S> the flux of high - energy ( @xmath0gev ) neutrinos consists primarily of those produced by cosmic - ray interactions in the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from extraterrestrial sources is still unknown . </S>",
    "<S> current limits suggest that the observed spectrum is dominated by atmospheric neutrinos up to at least @xmath1  tev . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of charmed hadrons to the flux of atmospheric neutrinos is important in the context of the search for astrophysical neutrinos because the spectrum of such  prompt \" neutrinos is harder than that of  conventional \" neutrinos from decay of pions and kaons . </S>",
    "<S> the prompt component therefore becomes increasingly important as energy increases . </S>",
    "<S> this paper reviews the status of the search for prompt muons and neutrinos with emphasis on the complementary aspects of muons , electron neutrinos and muon neutrinos . </S>"
