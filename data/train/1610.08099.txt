    "in the last decade , one of the big challenges for physicists is the explanation of the essence and mechanism of the acceleration of our universe @xcite , in this era of the universe , which has confirmed by some observation data such as supernova type ia @xcite baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite weak lensing @xcite and large scale structure @xcite .",
    "however , a plausible elucidation for this is commonly done using the model of a very exotic fluid called dark energy which has negative pressure .",
    "another well - known possibility is to modify einstein s general relativity @xcite , making the action of the theory dependent on a function of the curvature scalar @xmath1 , but at a certain limit of parameters the theory falls in general relativity .",
    "this procedure of explaining the accelerated expansion of our universe is known as modified gravity .",
    "an alternative , consistently describing the gravitational interaction , is one which only acknowledges the torsion of spacetime , thus cancelling out any effect of the curvature .",
    "this approach is known as teleparallel theory @xcite which is demonstrably equivalent to general relativity .",
    "teleparallel gravity enables one to say that gravity is not due to curvature , but the torsion .",
    "the choice of unknown functions , somewhat arbitrary , such as coupling functions and potentials in the equations of motion obtained from the point like lagrangian of the extended models has given rise to objections of fine tuning , the very problem whose solutions have been set out through inflationary theories .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have a path to derive the potential , or at least some criteria for acceptable potentials .",
    "one such approach is based on noether symmetry and was recently applied by s. capozziello @xmath2 @xmath3 .",

    "noether approach , representing several conserved currents ( noether currents ) , is not conducive to any solutions while matching all or a portion of with field equations .",
    "the more currents there are the more problems pile up . on the other hand , hidden currents derivable from continuity equation @xcite , are desired to be included , but when doing so things get worse due to the abundance of currents .",
    "the point is , with or without intervening hidden currents , one is compelled to cross out some in order to reach at a solution . in this paper , we introduce a new approach , b.n.s .",

    "hamiltonian constraint gives the wheeler - de witt equation [ wdw ]    function of the universe .",
    "pursuant to noether symmetry , if we use the following two conserved currents [ conserved currents of sns . used in wdw ] _ w = _ 1 , _ a = _ 2 , and according to [ psi ] |= _ j=1^m e^i _ jq^j    @xmath114 are the directions where symmetries do not exist , @xmath85 is the total dimension of minisuperspace , we have [ wave function ] |(w , u , a)= e^i _ 1 w e^i _ 2 a |(u)after putting this solution in eq .

    "it is clear that oscillating feature of wave function of universe , recovers the so - called hartle criterion @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we studied an original action in teleparallel gravity which has never been introduced in the literatures . however",
    "the @xmath0 version of the action ( [ action ] ) has been introduced and studied in some papers @xcite-@xcite . by the use of noether approach",
    ", we found that late  time ",
    "accelerated expansion is realized with this model .",
    "our data analysis showed that the age of universe is @xmath119 @xmath51 , the present amount of scale factor , deceleration and eos parameters are @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively and the scalar field , @xmath10 , and coupling function , @xmath56 , with decreasing nature while scaler potential , @xmath11 , increasing with time . considering deceleration parameter , we learned that the universe starts accelerating from @xmath123 , which is equivalent to @xmath124 .",
    "the resulting model crosses the phantom divide line from the quintessence phase to the phantom phase .",
    "we obtained the quadratic coupling function , @xmath56 , to be real in the action ( [ action ] ) but @xmath25 itself was pure imaginary .",
    "we presented an original approach as `` b.n.s .",
    "approach '' for easy solving the field equations with keeping almost all conserved currents which we want to have , and showed that unlike noether approach , we have solutions with this approach .",
    "our solutions could describe dark energy dominated era . and",
    "in the section [ v ] we considered wdw - equation and showed that wave function of universe has oscillating features which in the cosmic evolution recovers the so - called hartle criterion .",
    "finally , we would like to compare our ns - results with sns - results of ref .",
    "@xcite which considered @xmath0 version of the action ( [ action ] ) . by taking the incorrect vector field as @xmath125 , they showed that the scale factor is about @xmath126 while in our case it is about @xmath127 . according to the extra term , @xmath128 , in the parenthesis , other things are different .",
    "however , regarding the flrw spacetime , we took different vector field as ( [ four vector ] ) .",
    "anyway , both versions , show late  time ",
    "accelerated expansion .",
    "it is worth to note that the behavior of scalar field is different ; that is , in our case it has decreasing nature while in that paper it has increasing nature after a little detractive behavior . in that paper",
    ", they studied qualitative behavior of @xmath45 and @xmath99 versus time only , so we ca nt discuss more .",
    "howbeit , i am sure that in that paper , one can show pure imaginary nature of @xmath25 by data analysis , such as our case .",
    "however we have @xmath56 in that action , so it is not problematic .",
