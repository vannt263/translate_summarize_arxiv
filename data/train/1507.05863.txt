    "electromagnetic ( em ) waves propagating in inhomogeneous linear media exhibit a variety of intriguing phenomena associated with wave polarization .",
    "those include precession of the polarization vector , known as the rytov rotation @xcite , and also the polarization - driven bending of ray trajectories , known as the optical magnus effect or the optical hall effect @xcite .",
    "as overviewed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , these phenomena can be attributed as manifestations of the berry phase @xcite , which is a fundamental concept emerging also in many other areas of physics @xcite .",
    "hence the subject has been attracting an increased amount of attention , especially with focus on variational formulations , which are particularly elucidating at studying em polarization effects in the geometrical - optics ( go ) limit @xcite .",
    "yet a straightforward universal theory is still lacking . within existing models , ray lagrangians and hamiltonians either have to be guessed or are derived using additional postulates like quantization , which is , by definition , alien to classical theory . such",
    "_ ad  hoc _ approaches result in a number of limitations ; e.g.,they are not readily applicable to media with nonlocal and strongly anisotropic dispersion like magnetized plasma .",
    "thus , there is a compelling need for a generalized and simplified description of em polarization effects from first principles .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present such a description .",
    "more specifically , what we report here is a new application of the general theory that we derived earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite for the dirac electron . in the present paper , we explain how _ exactly the same theory _ can be applied to go em waves and polarization effects in particular . as opposed to ref .",
    "@xcite , our derivation is entirely classical .",
    "it is also straightforward and elementary in the sense that the wave lagrangian does not need to be guessed , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , but is rather deduced ( basically , using nothing more than matrix multiplication ) according to a formalized algorithm .",
    "the known results are successfully reproduced and are extended as follows : ( i )  we show that , in addition to the commonly known ray lagrangian that features the berry connection @xcite , an alternative ray lagrangian is possible that naturally has a canonical form and corresponds to a hamiltonian simpler than that proposed in ref .",
    "we explain how the two lagrangians are related and demonstrate their ( approximate ) equivalence numerically .",
    "( ii )  as opposed to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , our lagrangians are expressed in terms of physical time and wave vector , so they capture the complete ray dynamics rather than just the ray trajectory .",
    "( iii )  in addition to eigenray equations , we also derive equations for continuous wave fields and rays with mixed polarization , or `` entangled '' waves .",
    "this description captures both the rytov rotation and the optical hall effect simultaneously , and it is also manifestly conservative , since the amplitude equations too are derived from a variational principle .",
    "the calculation presented below applies to arbitrary linear stationary lossless media with isotropic local dispersion , i.e.,media whose dielectric and magnetic permittivities are real scalars depending only on spatial coordinates .",
    "however , within our theory , generalizations to strongly anisotropic media with nonlocal dispersion , such as magnetized plasma , are straightforward to do .",
    "the present paper is intended as an introduction to such calculations , which will be reported separately .",

    "@xcite , we showed that such a simple structure is convenient for studying a point - particle model of the spin - orbit coupling for the dirac electron .",
    "below , we report how the calculation can also be extended to study the effect of polarization of classical waves in dielectrics of the specified type .",

    "<S> the propagation of electromagnetic waves in isotropic dielectric media with local dispersion is studied under the assumption of small but nonvanishing @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the wavelength , and @xmath2 is the characteristic inhomogeneity scale . it is commonly known that , due to nonzero @xmath0 , such waves can experience polarization - driven bending of ray trajectories and polarization dynamics that can be interpreted as the precession of the wave `` spin '' . the present work reports how lagrangians describing these effects can be deduced , rather than guessed , within a strictly classical theory . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the commonly known ray lagrangian that features the berry connection , a simple alternative lagrangian is proposed that naturally has a canonical form . </S>",
    "<S> the presented theory captures not only the eigenray dynamics but also the dynamics of continuous wave fields and rays with mixed polarization , or `` entangled '' waves . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation assumes stationary lossless media with isotropic local dispersion , but generalizations to other media are straightforward to do . </S>"
