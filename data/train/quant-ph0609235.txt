    "efficient short - distance quantum state transfer is an important problem in the field of quantum computing .",
    "one of the most promising solutions is to use chains constructed from qubits that are statically coupled to each other .",
    "the idea to use quantum spin chains was initially put forward by bose @xcite and then developed in a number of papers .",
    "these proposals exploit the unitary time evolution governed by the system hamiltonian .",
    "the state is initialized / encoded at the sender part of the chain and then , after a certain time , measured / decoded at the receiving part of the chain . the major advantage of this method is its simplicity : it does not require controllable coupling constants between the qubits or complicated gating schemes .",
    "it was shown @xcite that for short - length chains the fidelity of state transfer is high , i.e. , close to one .",
    "but the fact that it is substantially reduced with the length of the chain triggered the search of methods that allow to increase the fidelity or even to obtain perfect state transfer , in the absence of decoherence and relaxation processes .",
    "the main reason for imperfect transfer is the dispersion of the initial information over the whole chain .",
    "therefore it was proposed to use spatially varying coupling constants to `` refocus '' the information at the receiving part of the chain @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to encode the information in gaussian wave packets ( with low dispersion ) spread over several spins @xcite .",
    "chains where the first and the last qubits are only weakly coupled to the rest of the chain provide a very high fidelity @xcite , because the intermediate spins are only slightly excited , which means that dispersion is small .",
    "this method has the major disadvantage that the time required for the transfer is long compared to the qubit decoherence / relaxation times in present experimental setups .",
    "the idea of so - called conclusive transfer , providing perfect state transfer using parallel quantum channels @xcite , is very promising .",
    "it can be realized using almost any spin chain and it is stable against fluctuations of the chain parameters @xcite .",
    "almost all the proposals mentioned above have one common disadvantage : the time interval for which the fidelity is high is very small for physical qubits and realistic qubit coupling parameters .",
    "for example , for a chain of flux qubits @xcite with realistic experimental parameters @xcite , the half - width of the first fidelity maximum is about @xmath0ns . at these time scales state readout and manipulation is impossible using current experimental technology . here",
    "we show that by dynamically varying the coupling constants only between the first and the last pair of qubits we can solve this problem and also increase the fidelity of state transfer .    in real chains the state to be transmitted",
    "is initialized in the first qubit , and this process must not influence the fidelity and dynamics of the chain .",
    "the most natural idea for a full transferring protocol is as follows : initialize the state in the first qubit , that is decoupled from the rest of the chain , then adiabatically couple it , wait a certain time and then adiabatically decouple the last qubit from the chain .",
    "this method requires two controllable gates like one of the proposals for achieving perfect state transfer @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the main purpose of the gates is to localize the state on the last qubit where it can be manipulated during times that are comparable to the decoherence / relaxation times .    in the following",
    "we use the terms spin and qubit as equivalent .",
    "state @xmath1 in qubit language ( which we will also call `` excitation '' ) corresponds to spin - up in spin language , and state @xmath2 corresponds to spin - down .",
    "we consider the xxz - hamiltonian with time dependent coupling constants between the first and the last pair of qubits :    @xmath3    this type of hamiltonian or some of its special cases is used in most of the papers mentioned above .",
    "the xx - part of the hamiltonian describes the tunneling of the excitation from one site to another and is a necessary requirement for quantum state transfer .     and",

    "the time - dependent coupling constants can be realized by varying the gate voltages on the @xmath9st/@xmath10nd and @xmath11th/@xmath12th qubits for the flux qubit chain , or by replacing the josephson junction between the charge qubits with a squid and varying the flux through it .    as a model",
    "we use `` fermi - function like '' coupling constants :    @xmath13    with    @xmath14    these are smooth functions that vary from @xmath15 ( no coupling ) to @xmath16 ( full coupling ) and vice versa , see fig .",
    "[ fig0a ] .",
    "the time scale of the coupling / decoupling procedure is determined by @xmath17 .",
    "instant coupling / decoupling corresponds to @xmath18 .",
    "our goal is to calculate the fidelity of the state transfer , the quantity that characterizes the quality of the transmission line .",
    "let us assume that the chain is initialized in the state @xmath19 .",
    "then , the first qubit is prepared in the state @xmath20 , i.e. the total state of the array is @xmath21 .",
    "this is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ xxz ] ) , therefore the system will evolve in time . after a time @xmath22 the state of the last qubit",
    "is read out .",
    "following bose@xcite , we average the fidelity over all pure input states on the bloch sphere    @xmath23    to obtain a quantity @xmath24 that measures the quality of transmission independent of @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the reduced density matrix of the last qubit .",
    "fidelity one corresponds to the perfect state transfer .    by numerically solving the schrdinger equation for the time - dependent hamiltonian ( [ xxz ] ) we get the fidelity of the state transfer as a function of time and the coupling parameters @xmath17 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the fidelity has a complex oscillating behavior .",
    "our goal is to find the coupling parameters that allow us to localize the state at the last qubit by decoupling it from the rest of the chain such that the fidelity is maximal . in comparing this fidelity with the static case ,",
    "we concentrate on the first maximum : higher maxima appear only after times much longer than the time at which the first one occurs@xcite .",
    "the typical behavior of @xmath28 for the static chain in the vicinity of the first maximum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ( dashed line ) .     and",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath5 , @xmath6.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure 2 also shows the fidelity in the presence of time - dependent coupling constants ( solid line ) .",
    "one can see that at large time the state is localized at the last qubit with a fidelity @xmath29 that is higher than for static coupling constants .",
    "the time at which the maximum is achieved is slightly larger .",
    "this is natural since in the presence of the coupling / decoupling procedure the transmission of the information from the first qubit to the chain and then to the last qubit is slower . after decoupling ,",
    "the localized state can be manipulated during a time interval comparable with the decoherence and relaxation times for the qubit , which are several orders of magnitude longer then the half - width of the first fidelity maximum in the static case in present experimental setups .",
    "we would like to mention that the first fidelity maximum in the case of dynamical coupling constants is even higher than the stationary value of the fidelity after decoupling .",
    "numerical calculations show that it can exceed the value 0.99 ( but , in this case , after the full decoupling the fidelity will go down to about 0.9 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the fidelity of the state transfer after completely decoupling the last qubit from the rest of the chain for @xmath30 as a function of the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath27 ( for @xmath6 ) . there is a region where the fidelity for the localized state is higher than in the time - independent case ( up to @xmath31 ) .    , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath32 , @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath33 is the first fidelity maximum for the ideal chain with static coupling constants .",
    "inset : distribution of the fidelity difference between the dynamical and statical cases in the presence of equal disorder.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the origin of this phenomenon is similar to the effect described in ref . . by dynamically varying the coupling constant between the first and the second qubit , the information about the state enters the chain as a wave packet that has small dispersion .",
    "this corresponds to some sort of filtering , an interpretation in agreement with the fact that the fidelity is higher in the case of equal `` profiles '' for the coupling and decoupling functions .",
    "if we use dynamical decoupling only at the end of the chain and employ instant coupling to initialize the chain , the maximal possible fidelity for a chain of @xmath5 qubits drops from about @xmath34 to @xmath35 ( but it is still higher than the fidelity for the time - independent case , which is around @xmath36 ) .",
    "an intuitive explanation is as follows : during the dynamical decoupling , the information , that is still dispersed in the chain , will arrive at the last qubit .",
    "therefore , slow decoupling allows more information to be gathered before the full decoupling occurs .",
    "experimental qubit arrays are always inhomogeneous , so in the rest of the paper we will discuss the effect of static disorder in @xmath16 and dynamical fluctuations in the coupling / decoupling functions . for charge qubit arrays ,",
    "the most important source of inhomogeneity is the variance of the josephson energies of the junctions ( about @xmath37 ) . in the case of the flux - qubit chain with capacitive coupling",
    ", @xmath16 is a complicated function of the josephson and charging energies as well as the capacitance of the coupling capacitor , see ref . .",
    "a rough estimate using realistic parameters leads to a variance of @xmath38 .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations to evaluate the time evolution of the system . as a result",
    "we find that the phenomena described above , are stable to static disorder and dynamical fluctuations in the coupling functions , see figs .",
    "[ fig2],[fig4 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the distribution of the fidelity after complete decoupling in the presence of disorder in the coupling constants .",
    "its half - width is quite small : even in the worst case the fidelity is higher than the fidelity of the ideal chain without disorder .",
    "the graph was constructed using a numerical simulation for an ensemble of @xmath39 chains where the coupling constants were of the form @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 was a random number with uniform distribution in the interval @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the difference between the fidelities for different realizations of the chains with constant and time - dependent couplings .",
    "this difference is around @xmath44 , so the effect of increased fidelity persists . in each realization",
    "both chains have the same randomized coupling constants and the only difference is that @xmath45 and @xmath4 are not multiplied by coupling functions for the time - independent chain .    , @xmath32 , @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath46 is the fidelity after decoupling in the absence of fluctuations.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure  [ fig4 ] shows the influence of fluctuations in the coupling / decoupling functions . here",

    "one can see that the influence of these fluctuations is small .",

    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath17 and @xmath27 are chosen to maximize it .",
    "one can see that this type of dynamical coupling also allows us to have better state transfer than for the chain with constant couplings ( where the height of the first maximum is @xmath33 ) .",
    "in general , wave packets with bigger width have lower dispersion .",
    "therefore we expect that every smooth monotonic coupling / decoupling function with equal profiles will allow us to improve the fidelity of state transfer .",
