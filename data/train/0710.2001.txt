    "in contrast to @xmath137 , the component @xmath139 decays faster as the number of spins increases .",
    "when the latter is small , @xmath139 may revive to decay again and so forth .",
    "the numerical simulation shows that the details of the time evolution of the reduced density matrix are rather complex and depend on the different values of the parameters of the model , including the number of bath spins . for example",
    "if we set @xmath140 , we observe that the oscillations are quickly suppressed with the increase of the strength of the magnetic field , or the value of the coupling constant @xmath19 . in this case , the components @xmath141 do not vanish at long time scales ; the corresponding asymptotic values depend , however , on @xmath2 in contrast to the antiferromagnetic case . for large values of the coupling constant @xmath17 ,",
    "the component @xmath137 quickly decays whereas @xmath142 oscillates around zero with large amplitudes ( typically of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding initial value ) .",
    "we also notice that the frequencies of the damped oscillations increase with the increase of the number of bath spins as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] . roughly speaking ,",
    "when @xmath143 , the behavior of the components of the bloch vector is quiet similar to the antiferromagnetic counterpart .",
    "for example when @xmath20 , the components @xmath144 show saturation behavior with respect to the number of spins @xmath2 ; their asymptotic values are different from zero .    in order to explain the differences between the behavior of the reduced density matrix in the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic environments",
    ", we note that in the latter case , the form of interactions favors antiparallel spins .",
    "this is the reason for which the ground state of the antiferromagnetic bath , @xmath145 , is equal to @xmath146 . on the contrary",

    "hence we conclude that the hamiltonian @xmath27 displays quantum phase transition at @xmath91 .",
    "this is the reason for which the reduced dynamics depends on whether the anisotropy constant is less or greater than one .",
    "note that the mean value of @xmath46 is close to zero in the case of antiferromagnetic interactions within the spin bath in contrast with the ferromagnetic case where @xmath154 .",
    "obviously , the central spin decoheres less if the spin bath , to which it couples , is characterized by a total angular momentum close to zero . at zero temperature",
    ", the antiferromagnetic bath occupies its ground state @xmath146 which is an eigenvector of @xmath27 , and satisfies @xmath155 .",
    "hence , the central spin remains decoupled from the bath if the initial state factorizes : the two - level system preserves its coherence regardless of the number of environmental spins .",
    "let us now consider the case where @xmath20 and @xmath143 . at low temperatures , the total angular momentum of the ferromagnetic bath has the tendency to be directed along the @xmath9 direction .",
    "since the central spin couples to the bath through heisenberg @xmath21 interactions ( @xmath20 ) , we end up with a situation quiet similar to that where @xmath156 .",
    "the above results show that properties of the bath at zero temperature affect the behavior of the reduced dynamics when @xmath157 . at infinite temperature ,",
    "the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic environments become completely unpolarized ; the reduced dynamics displays the same behavior in both systems as @xmath2 increases .",
    "this section is devoted to the case of an infinite number of spins in the environment , i.e. the case @xmath159 .",
    "we investigate the effect of the bath temperature , the external magnetic field , and the anisotropy constant on the reduced density matrix of the central spin . to this end",

    "<S> the time evolution of a spin-@xmath0 particle under the influence of a locally applied external magnetic field , and interacting with anisotropic spin environment in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath1 is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the exact analytical form of the reduced density matrix of the central spin is calculated explicitly for finite number of bath spins . </S>",
    "<S> the case of an infinite number of environmental spins is investigated using the convergence of the rescaled bath operators to normal gaussian random variables . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the analytical form of the components of the bloch vector for antiferromagnetic interactions within the bath , and we investigate the short - time and long - time behavior of reduced dynamics . the effect of the external magnetic field , the anisotropy and the temperature of the bath on the decoherence of the central spin is discussed . </S>"
