    "the problem of enclosed pedestrian evacuation has been studied from various points of view . on the one hand it presents academic interest because of its similarity with makeshift linked to granular media @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "understanding the dynamics of the movement of pedestrians and anticipating the problems that may arise in an emergency situation is critical in the design of large spaces that will be occupied by many people @xcite .",
    "the efficient evacuation of the occupants of such places under a state of emergency is fundamental when trying to minimize the negative effects of panic and confusion , clogging and avalanches .",
    "predicting evacuation patterns is one of the first steps towards this goal .",
    "evacuation is only a particular aspect of a broader problem : the pedestrian movement .",
    "pedestrian dynamics has been extensively studied from a theoretical @xcite and experimental point of view @xcite .",
    "the associated pedestrian flow is usually modeled as a many - body system of interacting individuals .",
    "the literature on this subject is rather extensive @xcite , exposing several different approaches to the problem . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors introduce the active walker model to describe human trail formation and they show that the pedestrian flow system exhibits various collective phenomena interpreted as self - organized effects . in @xcite",
    "the author suggest that the behaviors of pedestrian crowds are similar to gases or fluids .",
    "other authors prefer the formalism of cellular automata to frame their models @xcite .",
    "this is the approach we are going to adopt in the present work .    in the present lattice gas @xcite model , @xmath0",
    "pedestrians are set on the sites of a @xmath1 lattice , with the restriction that each site can not hold more than one walker .",
    "the pedestrians move to empty sites according to a preferential direction dictated by the need of escaping from the room @xcite .",
    "conflicts between agents that want to get to the same position are solved using specific game rules and taking into account previously defined strategies ( of cooperation or defection ) which represent the characters of the agents .",
    "hence , the considered pedestrian dynamics include games between agents which affect their possibilities of leaving the room .",
    "real pedestrians are entities much more complex than automata with the sole idea of escaping from a room .",
    "one of the most difficult aspects of modeling pedestrian flow is to simulate the effects of subjective aspects that affect the interaction among the pedestrians @xcite .",
    "most of the models have focused on modeling the flow of individuals in pure mechanistic approaches but the behavioral reaction of the evacuees during their movement has not been so far investigated in detail . by including a game dynamics in the resolution of conflicts between pedestrians",
    ", the present work aims at opening a door to the analysis of this important and rather complex feature .",
    "first , we want to introduce some basic concepts of game theory and 2 x 2 symmetric games that are relevant for the pedestrian dynamics that we will consider . a two players game can be characterized by the set of the strategies that the players can adopt and by the payoff received by each strategy when confronting any other .",
    "if the game is symmetric , i.e. both players have access to the same set of strategies and payoffs , the information can be uploaded in an @xmath2 matrix , with @xmath3 the number of strategies . in 1966 , m. guyer and a. rapoport @xcite cataloged all the @xmath4 games .",
    "there are twelve symmetric games , eight of them are trivial , in the sense that there is no conflict of interest as both players prefer the same outcome .",
    "the remaining four games represent four distinct social dilemmas .    in a @xmath4 game",
    "there are only two different strategies that can be defined as cooperative ( c ) and defective ( d ) .",
    "we can consider only relative payoff values , and this let us with four generic payoffs represented in the following matrix    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the contents of the matrix can be summarized as follows . in a game between @xmath3 cooperators and no defectors , there is always a winner .",
    "one of the players is randomly chosen to move ( with probability equal to @xmath5 ) . in a game with at least one defector , the existence of a winner is not ensured . in this case , the cooperators always loose and and each defector has probability @xmath6 of winning , with @xmath7 the number of cooperators in the game .",
    "the probability of having a winner is @xmath8 .      as stated before ,",
    "once all the conflicts have been solved , all the winners as well as all the agents that can move without conflict are finally moved to their selected sites . in case",
    "that one agent gets to a position with @xmath9 ( i.e. it reaches the exit ) , it is taken out of the system and the number of escaped agents is increased by one .",
    "we characterize the evacuation dynamics of the system by computing the _ mean exit time _ which is defined as the average over realizations of the number of time steps required to evacuate completely the room .",
    "we also study the time dependence of the _ mean number of escaped agents _ ,",
    "i.e. the average over realizations of the number of agents that have reach the exit at a given time .",
    "before considering the general case of a population with both cooperators and defectors , we study the extreme cases in which all the agents have the same strategy .",
    "first we consider a population in which all the agents are cooperators . in this case ,",
    "any conflict leads to a random game in which there is always a winner .",
    "namely , for a game between @xmath3 cooperators , each of them has a probability @xmath5 of becoming the winner and , thus , moving to the desired site .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath10 results irrelevant . in figure 2",
    "we show the positions of all the agents at six instances of the evolution for a single realization of the dynamics for a system of @xmath11 .",
    ".,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    figure ( [ figrandom ] ) shows results for the mean exit times and the number of escaped agents as a function of time for the evacuation dynamics from a square room considering different system parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in fig.([figrandom]).a we see that the mean exit time increases with @xmath14 more rapidly than exponentially .",
    "this means that the randomness of the dynamics strongly slows the evacuation process .",
    "note that the randomness may be associated to an uncertainty of the agents in their knowledge of the position of the door .",
    "we can also see that the mean exit time increases with the initial density , as could be expected .",
    "figure ( [ figrandom]).b shows that such a growth with @xmath15 is linear at fixed @xmath14 .",
    "in fig.([figrandom]).c we study the dependence of the mean exit time on the system size .",
    "we see that the growth is slower than exponential and faster than linear .",
    "finally , fig.([figrandom]).d shows the evolution of the mean number of escaped agents for different values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 . here",
    ", we see that the growth is linear along most of the evolution .",
    "small deviations from the linear regime occur for very short times and very long times .",
    "this is due to the fact that the flux of pedestrian out of the room is controlled mainly by the local density at the exit ( and by the parameter @xmath14 which is constant ) .",
    "the local density at the exit at small times coincides with @xmath15 , then it increases until it reaches a quasi - stationary value .",
    "such quasi - stationary density determines the slope of the linear growth of the evacuation profile .",
    "finally , at large times , when the evacuation process is about to finish , the density at the exit decreases and the flux at the door is reduced .",
    "fig.([figrandom]).d also shows that the slope of the linear growth is essentially independent of the initial density .",
    "this indicate that the quasi - stationary value of the density at the door depends only on @xmath14 , as could be expected .",

    "d ) evolution of the number of escaped agents for different values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 for @xmath17.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      now we consider a population in which all the agents are defectors .",
    "this is an extreme case opposite to the one considered in the previous subsection .",
    "we focus on the dependence of the results on the parameter @xmath10 which now becomes relevant as it rules the probabilities of motion resulting from all the conflicts .",
    "figure ( [ figalld]).a shows the mean exit time as a function of the initial density @xmath15 for different values of @xmath10 , while figure ( [ figalld]).b shows the mean exit time as a function of @xmath10 for different values of @xmath15 . for the sake of comparison , in both insets we also include the results for the only - cooperators case studied in the previous subsection .",
    "it can be seen that the mean exit time grows linearly both with @xmath15 ( fig.([figalld]).a ) and with @xmath10 ( fig.([figalld]).b ) .",
    "moreover the mean exit time for the only - collaborators case is always smaller than that for the only - defector case at any value of @xmath10 .",
    "this last fact can be understood as a consequence of the delays for stepping after the conflicts , which are present only for games with defectors .",

    "5.a we show the mean exit time as a function of the initial fraction of defectors @xmath18 for fixed values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 considering different values of @xmath10 .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath19 the exit time is almost independently of @xmath18 .",
    "this is so because in this case the penalization for defectors is null excepting for games with more than two defectors , which are likely only at large @xmath18 . at larger values of @xmath10",
    "the exit time grows approximately linearly with @xmath18 . in figure",
    "5.b we show the normalized exit time , defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the mean exit time obtained for an initial fraction of defectors @xmath18 .",
    "the plot shows us that the curves for large enough @xmath10 are close to collapse , indicating thus the approximately linear behavior with @xmath18 .",
    "however a close look to the figure reveals that the dependence on @xmath18 may be exactly linear only for a value of @xmath10 close to @xmath22 ( i.e. the limit between pd and sh games ) , while it is superlinear for smaller values of @xmath10 ( pd game ) and slightly sublinear for larger values of @xmath10 ( sh game ) .",

    "a ) exit time as a function of the initial fraction of defectors for different values of @xmath10 .",
    "b ) normalized exit time as a function of the fraction of defectors for the same systems as in ( a ) .",
    "all the calculations are for @xmath23 and @xmath24.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    one important questions we pose is whether cooperators can or can not take advantages from mutual cooperation as it was verified in other systems where cooperation arise as an emerging phenomena @xcite . with this goal in mind",
    "we characterize the dynamics of the system by three quantities , all of them aiming at revealing the relative success of the cooperators in finding the exit .",
    "first , we sample the composition of the population inside the room , comparing the instantaneous fraction of cooperators with the initial one .",
    "we define a normalized instantaneous fraction of cooperators in the room as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fraction of cooperators in the room at time @xmath27 .",
    "a departure of the derivative of @xmath28 from zero indicates that the leaving individuals do not represent a random sample of the population in the room .",
    "a positive ( negative ) value of @xmath28 indicates that the population in the room has a greater ( lower ) fraction of cooperators than the initial .",
    "meanwhile , a positive ( negative ) derivative of @xmath28 indicates that defectors ( cooperators ) are being more successful in finding the exit .",
    "figure [ room ] show the time behavior of this quantity for two values of the initial density of defectors and several values of @xmath10 for two different values of @xmath15 .",
    "we observe that for small values of @xmath10 we have @xmath29 throughout the evolution meaning that the defectors clearly surpass the cooperators in finding the exit .",
    "note that , not only @xmath28 is positive but its derivative increases with time , indicating the continuous increment of the fraction of cooperators in the room .",
    "but as @xmath10 increases and even still in the pd regime ( @xmath30 in the figure ) , the values of @xmath31 become negative meaning that the cooperators start to profit from mutual cooperation . while defectors loose time in futile arguments , the cooperators leave the room . @xmath28 and its derivative are negative , reflecting the ability of cooperators to reach the exit .",
    "normalized instantaneous fraction of cooperators within the room for different values of @xmath10 .",
    "results for @xmath32 , @xmath24 and @xmath33 considering an initial fraction of cooperators equal to @xmath34 ( a ) and @xmath35 ( b).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we have studied several initial configurations with different initial conditions including varying values for the initial density of individuals , the initial fraction of cooperators and defectors and several sizes . with some small variations ,",
    "we have found qualitatively the same results indicating the prevalence of defectors at small @xmath10 and the prevalence of collaborators at large @xmath10 .",
    "to complement this measure , we analyze the strategy of the individuals exiting the room at each time step and calculate the fraction of cooperators among them .",
    "we compare this fraction with the corresponding to the cooperators remaining in the room and define the normalized fraction of exiting cooperators as @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the ensemble averaged fraction of cooperators among exiting individuals at time @xmath27 .",
    "figures [ exit ] show the time behavior of @xmath38 for the same conditions situations analyzed in figure [ room ] .",
    "again , the fraction of exiting defectors is higher than the expected one for small values of @xmath10 but the situation is reversed as @xmath10 increases .     normalized fraction of cooperators exiting the room for different values of @xmath10 .",
    "results for @xmath32 , @xmath24 and @xmath33 considering an initial fraction of cooperators equal to @xmath34 ( a ) and @xmath35 ( b).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    as cooperators can only advantage defectors when interacting only among them , any evidence of cooperators performing better than defectors at leaving the room must be reflected in the formation of clusters of cooperators where mutual cooperation occurs . if cooperators are not clustered , the defectors will outstrip them",
    ". the effect of clustering of cooperators can be visually appreciated , but the assertion could be subjective .",
    "so we define a quantity that let us measure the instantaneous degree of clustering of cooperators by counting the fraction cooperating neighbors of each cooperating individual @xmath39 in the room @xmath40 and then we define @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath26 are the number and the fraction of cooperators in the room at time @xmath27 .",
    "we exclude isolated individuals from this count .",
    "clustering of cooperators in the room for different values of @xmath10 .",
    "results for @xmath32 , @xmath24 and @xmath33 considering an initial fraction of cooperators equal to @xmath34 ( a ) and @xmath35 ( b).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the results in figure [ clust ] confirm the occurrence of the expected behavior . when the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath38 indicate that cooperators are performing better than defectors in reaching the exit , the results for @xmath43 indicate an increase of the clustering of cooperators .",
    "the dynamics of the system leads to a partial segregation into cluster of cooperators and defectors , that leave the former in a situation of taking advantage from the benefits of mutual cooperation .",
    "figure [ clust ] shows also an interesting behavior for low values of @xmath10 .",
    "the curves show an increase of the clustering of cooperator , more apparent for @xmath19 in fig 1.a .",
    "this effect is different in nature and shape from those observed for higher values of @xmath10 .",
    "the origin of this increment correspond to the fact that defectors , freely to move due to low values of punishment manage to approach the exit , displacing the cooperators and producing a segregation that isolates the last from the door .",
    "this effect is verified in figs .",
    "[ room ] and [ exit ] , where we can observe that cooperator have difficulties in reaching the exit for values of @xmath10 close to 1 .",
    "this effect is also reflected in the fact that when the fraction of defectors is higher ( 0.6 in fig .",
    "[ clust].a vs. 0.2 in fig [ clust].b ) , the displacement of cooperators from the door and their corresponding segregation is enhanced .",
    "the results thus indicate that cooperators can take advantage from mutual cooperation for large enough values of @xmath10 , typically @xmath44 , well within the pd regime where still the dc payoff is larger than the cc one .",
    "the benefits from mutual cooperation are further enhanced in the sh regime ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "one of the shortcomings of the lattice gas models used in pedestrian dynamics is the lack of inclusion of behavioral aspects .",
    "considering this situation , the present work has a clear goal : to develop a simple model able to consider some individual attitudes that may affect the movement of interacting pedestrians . motivated by this objective , we have amalgamated models for pedestrian evacuation with game theory concepts and analyzed the emergence of non trivial effects that may manifest .",
    "the results show that the emerging phenomena observed in an evolutionary prisoner s dilemma are also present here . in these works",
    "@xcite the systems are spatially extended and allow for the cooperators to form clusters capable to resist the invasion of defectors and even to expand . in the present work the evolutionary aspects has not been so far included but the growth of clusters is promoted by the mobility of the individuals . as a result of this clustering , the cooperators can profit from the only advantage they have over the defectors : the mutual cooperation .",
    "when this happens , cooperators have more success in reaching the exit than defectors , as reflected in the plots .",
    "it is important to understand the limitation and scope of the present model .",
    "we are not intending to reproduce a real situation but to point out the effects that behavioral aspects may have on the denouement of an emergency evacuation scenario .",
    "future work envisions the inclusion of evolutionary strategies , differentiated social roles , off lattice dynamics and different geometries and obstacles .",
