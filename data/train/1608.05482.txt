    "* ) . in figures [ fig:1997ef ] and fig:2007ru",
    ", we show the light curves with @xmath66 , which evidently fail to reproduce the light curves",
    ". one common feature of these two sne is that their linear decay phase is consistent with nearly full trapping of @xmath2co .",
    "given this fact , the @xmath2ni mass can be accurately determined by modeling the late - time light curve of the sn because the contribution of magnetar at late times is negligible for sne ic - bl @xcite . in the top panels of figures fig:1997ef and [ fig:2007ru ] the solid lines",
    "are the synthesized light curves assuming full trapping .",
    "the full trapping is not rare for sne ic given that sn 2007bi also has a linear decay phase that is consistent with full trapping @xcite .",
    "this could indicate that these sne have some nontrivial density structure .",
    "the ejecta mass @xmath13 can be determined by equating the light curve rising time to the following effective diffusion timescale @xcite@xmath67where @xmath68 is the photospheric velocity of the sn .",
    "the optical opacity is fixed at @xmath69 in this work .",
    "however , one should not equate @xmath70 with the apparent rising time of sne ic - bl because their light curve can not be reproduced by pure @xmath2ni heating .",
    "instead , one should isolate the @xmath2ni contribution from the apparent light curve , as demonstrated in figures [ fig:1997ef ] and [ fig:2007ru ] and equate @xmath70 to the rising time of @xmath2ni contribution .",
    "one may be confused why we should discriminate the rising times from @xmath2ni contribution and magnetar contribution because equations @xmath71 and @xmath72 do not care if the energy input comes from the magnetar or the radioactive decay . actually in deriving equation @xmath73",
    "we implicitly assume that the energy release timescale @xmath74 is comparable to or longer than the ejecta expansion timescale @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "the reason that at time @xmath70 the luminosity reaches its peak is as follows .",
    "physical intuition tells us that the sn reaches peak luminosity when most of the available energy has the right time to diffuse out of the sn and at the same time the sn expands to a considerable distance so that its emitting surface is sufficiently large .",
    "then equating the diffusion timescale @xmath77 to the expansion timescale @xmath78 immediately leads to the effective diffusion timescale @xmath79 .. ] however , the condition @xmath80 is true for @xmath2ni decay , but not for magnetar input , which has a release timescale @xmath81 for both sn 1997ef and sn 2007ru .",
    "because the magnetar releases its energy in such a short time , the sn ejecta have no time to expand . as a result",
    ", its peak luminosity occurs at the time when the magnetar release most of its energy . in this aspect ,",
    "the magnetar - powered sne are more or less similar to the explosive energy release found in some type ii sne where the peak luminosity occurs at the time when the sne explode @xcite .",
    "this analysis indicates that , depending on the relative relation of the two timescales , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the magnetar - powered sn light curve could be similar to type i sne or type ii sne .",
    "given the ejecta mass , the kinetic energy of the sn can be evaluated .",
    "here we adopt the simple but quite plausible assumption that the kinetic energy of the sn is exclusively injected by the rapidly spinning magnetar .",
    "consequently , the initial rotational period @xmath82 of the magnetar can be determined .",
    "the magnetic dipole field of the magnetar , on the other hand , could be determined by modeling the early - time light curve . in this way , the four parameters in this model can all be tightly constrained .",
    "ni , while the dotted - dashed line is the light curve by setting the mass of @xmath2ni zero while other parameters are the same as that of the solid line .",
    "the dotted - dotted - dashed line is the difference between solid line and the dotted - dashed line .",
    "the dark short - dashed line is the light curve with @xmath83 .",

    "it is worthy of mentioning that the above analytical model , as a direct extension of the arnett model @xcite , is quite good at reproducing the light curve of a purely @xmath3ni - powered sn @xcite .",
    "when applying the pure @xmath2ni model to sne ic - bl , the mass of @xmath2ni is determined by the peak luminosity of the sn .",
    "but the @xmath2co tail modeling usually requires a much lower mass of @xmath2ni .",
    "hence an inconsistency appears . in other words , the poor fitting quality of",
    "the pure @xmath2ni model is intrinsic for sne ic - bl .",
    "figures [ fig:1997ef ] and [ fig:2007ru ] indicate that the ( assumed ) magnetars contribute dominantly to the early peaks of the light curves .",
    "this is the key that the actually needed @xmath2ni , @xmath85 for both sn 1997ef and sn 2007ru , is much lower than a pure @xmath3ni model .",
    "it is also evident from these figures that the late - time luminosities of these sne dominantly come from the decay energy of @xmath2ni and @xmath2co .",
    "table [ tbl : para ] shows that the ejecta masses @xmath13 are different from that given by the pure-@xmath2ni model , which favors the ejecta masses @xmath86 and @xmath87 for sn 1997ef @xcite and sn 2007ru @xcite , respectively .",
    "this difference is mainly because in this model the light curve peak is not caused by @xmath2ni .",
    "it can be checked that the values given in table [ tbl : para ] is consistent with equation @xmath88 if we realize that @xmath70 should be set equal to the rising time of @xmath2co contribution in figures [ fig:1997ef ] and [ fig:2007ru ] . in these figures the asymptotic expansion velocities",
    "are set to @xmath89 and @xmath90 for sn 1997ef and sn 2007ru , respectively .",
    "it is curious that the derived value @xmath86 by @xcite for sn 1997ef is even larger than the value given in this work in spite of the fact that the rising time in the pure-@xmath2ni model is shorter than the rising time of @xmath2co contribution in figure [ fig:1997ef ] .",
    "we note that the two models in @xcite , i.e. co60 and co100 , are almost identical in fitting the light curve of sn 1997ef , but give different values of ejecta mass , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "one can check that @xmath93 is consistent with the light curve rising time if the optical opacity is taken as @xmath94 .",
    "this may indicate the uncertainty in the numerical modeling by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2ni yield determined in the pure-@xmath2ni model is @xmath95 and @xmath96 for these two sne , respectively .",
    "as we said , the yield @xmath96 is hardly expected by the magnetar - driven shock @xmath2ni synthesis @xcite .",
    "in addition , what makes the pure-@xmath2ni model for sn 2007ru more or less unrealistic is the derived ratio @xmath97 , in tension with the theoretical expectation , which is predicted to be hardly larger than 0.2 @xcite .    in the middle panels of figures [ fig:1997ef ] and [ fig:2007ru ] we show the fraction of magnetar rotational energy deposited as the kinetic energy of the sn ejecta . from these figures",
    "it is clear that most ( @xmath98 ) of the rotational energy of the magnetars deposits as the kinetic energy of the sn ejecta and only @xmath99 of the rotational energy deposits to heat the ejecta , which is in accord with the expectation @xcite .    to figure out why only @xmath100 of the rotational energy is enough to heat the sne ic - bl to the observed luminosity , it is beneficial to compare the rotational energy of the magnetars@xmath101with the decay energy of @xmath2ni and @xmath2co@xmath102assuming that a fraction @xmath103 of the rotational energy of the magnetar @xmath104 is converted to the thermal energy of the sn , then the deposited thermal energy by the magnetar is equivalent to @xmath2ni of mass@xmath105where @xmath106 .",
    "because the needed masses of @xmath2ni by the previous analysis are @xmath11 , it is evident that the typical initial rotational period of the magnetars that powers the sne ic - bl is @xmath107 , in agreement with the values given in table tbl : para .",

    "as expected , the sn internal energy increases only slightly despite the tremendous energy injection rate @xmath109 during the spin - down timescale @xmath110 .",
    "this is just why the sne ic - bl powered by a rapidly spinning - down magnetar can gain the formidable kinetic energy @xmath5 .    with the parameters in table [ tbl : para ]",

    "@xcite it is expected that the magnetic dipole field of the ( assumed ) magnetars that powers sne ic - bl is much stronger than that powers slsne .",
    "this is evident from table [ tbl : para ] that the best - fit magnetic dipole field of the magnetar is @xmath118 , whereas the magnetic field in the case of slsne is typically @xmath119 .    finally ,",
    "because of the high magnetic field strength @xmath120 and the rapid spinning of the magnetar @xmath107 , the @xmath3ni with mass as low as @xmath121 can be synthesized by the magnetar model @xcite .",
    "it is clear from above analyses that a self - consistent magnetar model for the sne ic - bl is established .",
    "since their discovery , sne ic - bl pose an immediate challenge to the classical sn light curve modeling because the later failed to simultaneously reproduce the light curve around peak and the late - time linear decline . as a reasonable attempt",
    ", @xcite proposed a two - component model for sne ic - bl in which the bright peak is produced by the fast - moving outer component while the linear tail is attributed to the slower dense inner component . because the two - component model and the model presented here both assume that the linear tail of the sne ic - bl light curve can be attributed to @xmath2co decay",
    ", it would be beneficial to compare the @xmath2ni mass inferred here with the inner component @xmath2ni mass inferred in the two - component model .",
    "for sn 1997ef , @xcite gave the @xmath2ni mass of the inner component @xmath122 , which is close to our determination taking into account the different value of @xmath38 adopted in these two works .",
    "we also note that for the grb - associated sn 1998bw , @xcite found @xmath123 , which is much smaller than the usually assumed value @xmath124 .",
    "this justifies our finding that the @xmath1ni mass for the tail modeling is usually much smaller than the peak modeling .",
    "our results have immediate stimulations for further research .",
    "first , although here we have studied the sne ic - bl not associated with grbs , the main conclusion can be equally applied to grb - sne .",
    "it is usually believed that the central engine of grbs are black holes @xcite or magnetars @xcite . however , since it is currently infeasible to identify the grb central engine directly because of the cosmological distance scales of grbs @xcite , the researchers instead pursue indirect signatures of black holes @xcite and magnetars @xcite that powers the energetic grbs .",
    "growing indirect observational evidence suggests that magnetars could act as the central engine of both lgrbs and sgrbs @xcite .",
    "however , because of the high mass of @xmath2ni needed to heat the grb - sne , magnetars are doubted as the candidate central engine of grbs . with our demonstration that this high mass of @xmath2ni is actually not the case , such a concern is removed.ni decay under the assumption that the central engine of grb - sne is a magnetar . in drawing this conclusion ,",
    "@xcite assume that the mangetar s rotational energy is equally divided between grb afterglow and sn .",
    "this assumption is somewhat _ ad hoc _ and unjustified . at the least , although the jet launching could be the result of the magnetar spin - down , it seems more likely to be the result of accretion onto the magnetar @xcite .",
    "furthermore , canojohansson16 do not consider the origin of the kinetic energy of the grb - sne in their model .",
    "if we accept the assumption that the huge amount of kinetic energy of the grb - sne comes from the rotational energy of the magnetar , the initial rotational period of the magnetar can not be as long as given by @xcite . finally , as we mentioned above , our conclusion that the @xmath2ni mass for the tail modeling is usually much smaller than the peak modeling is consistent with the finding by maeda03 .",
    "]    second , it is still debated how the jet is launched by a rapidly rotating magnetar .",
    "comparison of slsne and sn ic - bl may have some implications for this open issue .",
    "observation shows little evidence of jet associated with slsne , while some sne ic - bl are accompanied by grb jets . even for those sne ic - bl",
    "not associated with grbs , jets or aspheric expansion are frequently observed .",
    "because the initial rotational periods of the magnetars that power slsne and sne ic - bl are similar , we hypothesize that the magnetic field of the magnetar might be essential for the jet launch given the fact that the magnetic field of magnetar that powers sne ic - bl is much stronger than that powers slsne .",
    "this hypothesis relies on future numerical simulations .",
    "we note , however , that @xcite found the magnetic dipole field of the ( assumed ) magnetar powering grb111209a / sn2011kl to be only @xmath125 , close to that powering slsne .",
    "this may indicate that strong magnetic field is not a necessary condition for jet launch .",
    "nevertheless , the contamination by grb afterglow and host galaxy background makes the grb - sne light curves poorly sampled and parameter degeneracy could bias the fitting values , e.g. the magnetic dipole field @xmath126 and the @xmath2ni masses .",
    "third , we find that the typical magnetic field of the ( assumed ) magnetars that powers sne ic - bl is @xmath127 , which is two orders of magnitude stronger than the field of the magnetars that powers slsne , despite the fact that they are both millisecond magnetars and are all formed during the core collapse of massive progenitors .",
    "this implies that the magnetic amplification mechanisms @xcite could be quite different .",
    "this calls for more elaborated numerical simulations that take into account more microphysical processes . the dipole field as strong as @xmath127 is rare but achievable in theoretical aspects .",
    "it is expected that the collapse of the iron core of the supernova progenitor first results in a proto - neutron star ( pns ) .",
    "the differential rotation of pns could amplify the toroidal field to @xmath128 and above @xcite .",
    "several magnetic field amplification mechanisms could operate , including the linear amplification @xcite , @xmath129-@xmath130 dynamo @xcite , and magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "the toroidal field could be amplified to @xmath131 before the buoyancy effect takes it to emerge from the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the emerged dipole field could be as strong as @xmath128 .",

    "<S> we therefore suggest that magnetars could power sne ic - bl both in aspects of energetics and of @xmath2ni synthesis .    # 1 # 1 </S>"
