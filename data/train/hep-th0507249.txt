    "the discovery that general relativity hides dynamical symmetries associated with infinite lie algebras of the ka  moody type is an old one and dates back to the work of geroch @xcite . considering metrics that admit two commuting , space - like killing vectors , geroch effectively reduced einstein gravity to @xmath1 and showed that the space of such solutions is mapped into itself by an infinite group of symmetries , whose lie algebra , in modern parlance , is @xmath15 , namely the affine ka ",
    "moody extension of @xmath16 , the lie algebra of the three - parameter group @xmath17 .",
    "these quite intriguing symmetries were extensively analyzed at the end of the seventies and in the beginning of the eighties by several groups ( for a comprehensive review see ) and a formalism was developed to cope with them in a mathematical rigorous and effective way that is centered on the notion of _ linear system_. to summarize a complicated story in a few words we just recall that ka ",
    "moody algebras @xcite are the lie algebras of centrally extended loop groups , namely the groups of analytic maps from a circle into an ordinary simple lie group @xmath18 : @xmath19 calling @xmath20 $ ] a local coordinate on @xmath21 , a group element @xmath22 is represented by a pair @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a group element of the simple lie group which depends analytically on @xmath25 and @xmath26 is an exponent of the central element . in the set up of linear systems",
    "all possible solutions of einstein gravity reduced to @xmath1 are associated with all possible maps from the @xmath1 space - time @xmath27 to the infinite - dimensional coset @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the centrally extended loop group of @xmath17 and @xmath30 is its _ maximal compact subgroup_. in other words , reduced to @xmath1 einstein gravity becomes a sort of @xmath31model : @xmath32 where the target space space is the infinite dimensional affine generalization of the maximally split , non compact coset @xmath33 .",
    "as we are going to stress in the present paper by recalling and generalizing results which were obtained times ago by nicolai @xcite , naive dimensional reduction of the einstein lagrangian produces a @xmath34gravity coupled @xmath31-model , where the target manifold is indeed @xmath33 : @xmath35 the replacement of equation ( [ normsigma ] ) with eq.([sortofsigma ] ) occurs because there are two different ways of obtaining ( [ normsigma ] ) via dimensional reductions which are non locally related to each other .",
    "covering the two pictures at the same time is equivalent to the affine extension , namely to eq.([sortofsigma ] ) .",
    "the main point of the present article is that this mechanism of generation of the infinite symmetries is actually completely general and follows a regular algebraic pattern for all supergravity theories which we plan to describe hereby , emphasizing its role in the discussion of cosmic billiard dynamics .",
    "this , however , is just an anticipation of our subsequent discussions . for the time",
    "being it suffices to note that an explicit map of the type advocated in eq .",
    "( [ sortofsigma ] ) is given by a coset representative @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an element of @xmath17 depending on the @xmath34 coordinates @xmath38 both explicitly and implicitly through the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is a logarithm of the conformal factor of two  dimensional metric .",
    "this is just the mathematical transcription of the formal map defined in eq.([sortofsigma ] ) . in the context of such a discussion , the coordinate @xmath25 on the circle",
    "is named the _",
    "spectral parameter_. once the algorithm that to each coset representative @xmath41 associates a solution of gravity and viceversa to each solution associates a coset representative has been established : @xmath42 then the action of the affine group on the space of solutions is easily defined by the left action of @xmath43 on @xmath41 .",
    "after this clarification occurred in the context of pure gravity the interest in infinite symmetries was stimulated by the advent of supergravity . by dimensionally reducing @xmath44 or @xmath45 supergravity to lower dimensions one discovers the so called hidden symmetries , that act as isometries of the kinetic metric on the scalars and as generalized electric / magnetic duality rotations on the vector fields or @xmath46forms . hidden symmetries were discovered specially through the work of cremmer and julia who found @xmath47 @xcite in @xmath48 supergravity and later clarified that @xmath49 is the duality symmetry for maximal supergravity in @xmath50-dimensions , obtained by compactification of m  theory on a @xmath51 torus .",
    "the continuation of the series to @xmath52 leads to algebras that are no longer finite dimensional , rather they are ka  moody algebras .",
    "indeed it was julia @xcite who already long time ago noted this phenomenon , pointing out that @xmath53 is just the affine extension of @xmath54 , while @xmath55 is its double hyperbolic extension .",
    "later , extensive work on @xmath56 and in general on the infinite symmetries of lower dimensional supergravities was performed by nicolai and collaborators in a large set of papers @xcite . notwithstanding the interest and the potential relevance of all these results",
    "it must be said that for a long time they did not find a convincing arena of applications in the context of superstring and brane theory , remaining an unexploited truth .",
    "this is even more surprising if one considers that precisely the finite dimensional relatives of these symmetries , namely the hidden symmetries in @xmath57 played a fundamental role in the so named second string revolution , namely in establishing the non perturbative dualities among the various string models . indeed ,",
    "as it is well known , those dualities that unify the various perturbative quantum strings into a unique m - theory are elements of a unified group @xmath58 which is the suitable restriction to integers of a corresponding lie group @xmath59 encoded in compactified supergravity and given , for toroidal compactifications , by the earlier mentioned @xmath49 series .",
    "this situation changed significantly , after 2001 , with the renewed interest in _ ka  moody symmetries _",
    "generated by the discovery of the _ cosmic billiard phenomenon_. this phenomenon encodes a profound link between the features of time evolution of the cosmological scale factors and the structure of the hidden symmetry algebra @xmath59 .",
    "let us name @xmath60 the number of supersymmetry charges . for @xmath61 the scalar manifold is always a homogeneous space @xmath8 and what actually happens is that the cosmological scale factors @xmath62 associated with the various dimensions of supergravity can be interpreted as exponentials of those scalar fields @xmath63 which lie in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath64 , while the other scalar fields in @xmath8 correspond to positive roots @xmath65 of the lie algebra @xmath64 . in this way the cosmological evolution is described by the motion of a _ fictitious ball _ in the csa of @xmath64 .",
    "this space is actually a billiard table whose walls are the hyperplanes orthogonal to the various roots .",
    "the fictitious ball bounces on the billiard walls and this means that there are inversions in the time evolution of the scale factors .",
    "certain dimension that were previously expanding almost suddenly begin to contract and others do the reverse .",
    "such a scenario was introduced by damour , henneaux , julia and nicolai in @xcite , and in a series of papers with collaborators @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , which generalize classical results obtained in the context of pure general relativity @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in their approach the quoted authors analyzed the cosmic billiard phenomenon as an asymptotic regime in the neighborhood of space - like singularities and the billiard walls were seen as delta function potentials provided by the various @xmath46forms of supergravity localized at sharp instants of time .",
    "the main focus of attention was centered on establishing whether and under which conditions there may be a _",
    "chaotic behaviour _ in the evolution of the scale factors and the same authors established that this may occur only when the billiard table , identified with the weyl chamber of the duality algebra @xmath64 is hyperbolic , namely when the double ka ",
    "moody extension of the hidden symmetries is taken in proper account .    with a different standpoint it was observed in @xcite that the fundamental mathematical setup underlying the appearance of the billiard phenomenon is the so named _",
    "solvable lie algebra parametrization _ of supergravity scalar manifolds , pioneered in @xcite and later applied to the solution of a large variety of superstring / supergravity problems ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . in particular we showed that one can implement the following programme :    1 .",
    "reduce the original supergravity in higher dimensions @xmath66 ( for instance @xmath67 ) to a gravity - coupled @xmath31model in @xmath68 where gravity is non  dynamical and where the original higher dimensional bosonic field equations reduce to geodesic equations for a solvable group - manifold , metrically equivalent to a non compact coset manifold @xmath69",
    "\\cong \\mathrm{u / h}$ ] .",
    "2 .   utilize the algebraic structure of the solvable lie algebra @xmath70 associated with the pair of the algebra @xmath64 and its maximal compact subalgebra @xmath71 in order to integrate analytically the geodesic equations .",
    "dimensionally oxide the solutions obtained in this way to exact time dependent solutions of @xmath66 supergravity .    within this approach",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the _ cosmic billiard phenomenon _ is indeed a general feature of exact time dependent solutions of supergravity and has _",
    "smooth realizations_. calling @xmath72 the @xmath73component vector of cartan fields ( where @xmath73 is the split rank of @xmath64 ) and @xmath74 its projection along any positive root @xmath75 , a _ bounce _ occurs at those instant of times @xmath76 such that : @xmath77 namely when the cartan field in the direction of some root @xmath75 inverts its behaviour and begins to shrink if it was growing or viceversa begins to grow if it was shrinking . since all higher dimensional bosonic fields ( off - diagonal components of the metric @xmath78 or @xmath46forms @xmath79}$ ] )",
    "are , via the solvable parametrization of @xmath8 , in one - to - one correspondence with roots @xmath80 , it follows that the bounce on a _ wall _ ( hyperplane orthogonal to the root @xmath75 ) is caused by the sudden growing of that particular field @xmath81 .",
    "indeed in the exact smooth solutions which we obtained in @xcite , each bounce is associated with a typical bell - shaped behaviour of the root field @xmath81 and the whole process can be interpreted as a temporary localization of the universe energy density in a _ lump _ on a spatial brane associated with the field @xmath81 .",
    "although very much encouraging , the analysis of @xcite was limited in various respects .",
    "one limitation , whose removal is the main motivation of the present paper , consists of the following .",
    "the dimensional reduction process which is responsible for making manifest the duality algebra @xmath82 and hence for creating the whole algebraic machinery utilized in deriving the _ smooth cosmic billiard solutions _ was stopped at @xmath83 namely at the first point where all the bosonic degrees of freedom can be represented by scalars . in @xmath83",
    ", @xmath64 is still a finite dimensional lie algebra and the whole richness of the underlying algebraic structure is not yet displayed . as implied by the results of @xcite , in order to investigate the most challenging aspects of billiard dynamics , in particular chaos , within the framework of exact solutions , we should derive these latter better in a @xmath1 or @xmath9 context where ka  moody symmetries become manifest . although the appearance of ka  moody extensions is algebraically well established , their exploitation in deriving solutions is not as clear as the exploitation of ordinary symmetries .",
    "indeed the main issue to clarify is the field theoretical realization of the ka  moody extensions which is the prerequisite for their utilization in deriving billiard dynamics .",
    "the present paper aims at providing a clearcut step - forward in this direction .",
    "in particular we want to show that there is a general mechanism underlying the affine ka",
    " moody extension of the d=3 algebra @xmath84 when we step down to @xmath1 and that this mechanism follows a general algebraic pattern for all supergravity theories , independently of the number of supercharges @xmath60 .",
    "as already mentioned above this mechanism relies on the existence of two different reduction schemes from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , respectively named the ehlers reduction and the matzner ",
    "misner reduction , which are non locally related to each other .",
    "nicolai observed this phenomenon time ago in the case of pure gravity ( or better of n=1 pure supergravity)@xcite and showed that one obtains two identical lagrangians , each displaying an @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "the fields appearing in one lagrangian have a non local relation to those of the other lagrangian and one can put together both @xmath17 algebras .",
    "one algebra generates local transformations on one set of fields the other algebra generates non local ones .",
    "together the six generators of the two @xmath17 provide a chevalley basis for the ka ",
    "moody extension @xmath29 namely for @xmath15 .",
    "our analysis will be an extension of the argument by nicolai . for a generic supergravity theory , the two reduction schemes ehlers and matzner  misner",
    "lead to two different lagrangians with different local symmetries .",
    "the first is a normal _ @xmath31model _ the second is a _",
    "twisted @xmath31model_. we shall discuss in detail the symmetries of both theories . just as in nicolai case we can put together the symmetries of both lagrangians and in this way we obtain a chevalley basis for the ka  moody algebra . in this way",
    "we can write down a precise field theoretic realization of the affine symmetries setting the basis to exploit them in billiard dynamics .",
    "we shall then comment on the further hyperbolic extension occurring in @xmath9 and on the nature of the billiard chamber .",
    "rather than starting from @xmath44 supergravity or @xmath85dimensional m - theory we begin our analysis from @xmath0 . how we stepped down from @xmath67 to @xmath0",
    "is not necessary to specify at this level .",
    "it is implicitly encoded in the number of residual supersymmetries that we consider .",
    "if @xmath86 is maximal it means that we used toroidal compactification .",
    "lower values of @xmath60 correspond to compactifications on manifolds of restricted holonomy , calabi yau three - folds , for instance , or orbifolds .",
    "the relevant point is that for @xmath0 _ ungauged supergravity _ the bosonic lagrangian admits a general form which we presently discuss and exploit in our argument .",
    "we have : @xmath87 - \\frac{1}{6 } \\partial_{\\hat{\\mu}}\\phi^a\\partial^{\\hat{\\mu}}\\phi^b h_{ab}(\\phi ) \\ , + \\ ,",

    "i.e. for @xmath94 , a large variety of homogeneous special khler @xcite fall into the set up of the present general discussion .",
    "the fields @xmath88 have @xmath31model interactions dictated by the metric @xmath95 of @xmath96 .",
    "the theory includes also @xmath97 vector fields @xmath98 for which @xmath99 \\label{fpiumeno}\\ ] ] denote the self - dual ( respectively antiself - dual ) parts of the field - strengths . as displayed in eq.([d4generlag ] ) they are non minimally coupled to the scalars via the symmetric complex matrix @xmath100 which transforms projectively under @xmath101 .",
    "indeed the field strengths @xmath102 plus their magnetic duals fill up a @xmath103dimensional symplectic representation of @xmath104 which we call by the name of @xmath105 .    following the notations and the conventions of @xcite , we rephrase the above statements by asserting that there is always a symplectic embedding of the duality group @xmath106 , @xmath107 so that for each element @xmath108 we have its representation by means of a suitable real symplectic matrix : @xmath109 satisfying the defining relation : @xmath110 which implies the following relations on the @xmath111 blocks : @xmath112 under an element of the duality groups the field strengths transform as follows : @xmath113 where , by their own definitions : @xmath114 and the complex symmetric matrix @xmath115 transforms as follows : @xmath116 eq.([d4generlag ] ) is the lagrangian that we are supposed to dimensionally reduce according to the two available schemes , the ehlers reduction and the matzner - misner reduction respectively .",
    "we will perform such reductions in later sections . prior to",
    "that we dwell on an algebraic interlude anticipating the result of the ehlers reduction and analyzing the algebraic structure of the @xmath84 algebra .",
    "such an analysis is very important in order to establish the properties of its affine extension and single out a basis of candidate chevalley - serre generators .",
    "upon toroidal dimensional reduction from @xmath0 to @xmath83 and then full  dualization of the vector fields , which is the ehlers scheme to be described in detail later , we obtain supergravity theories admitting a * duality lie algebra * @xmath84 whose structure is universal in the following sense",
    ". it always contains , as subalgebra , the duality algebra @xmath117 of the parent supergravity theory in @xmath0 times an @xmath118 algebra which is produced by the dimensional reduction of pure gravity ( see section [ ehlersgrav ] for the details ) .",
    "furthermore , with respect to this subalgebra @xmath84 admits the following universal decomposition , holding for all @xmath115-extended supergravities having semisimple duality algebras : @xmath119 where @xmath105 is the * symplectic * representation of @xmath117 discussed in the previous section .",

    "we denote the antisymmetric symplectic metric in @xmath130 dimensions , @xmath131 being the number of vector fields in @xmath0 , as we have already stressed .",
    "the symplectic character of the representation @xmath105 is asserted by the identity : @xmath132 the fundamental doublet representation of @xmath17 is also symplectic and we have denoted by @xmath133 the @xmath134-dimensional symplectic metric , so that : @xmath135 the matrices @xmath136 and @xmath137 are just symmetric matrices in one - to - one correspondence with the generators of @xmath117 and @xmath17 , respectively . implementing jacobi identities , however , we find the following relations : @xmath138 which admit the unique solution : @xmath139 where @xmath140 , @xmath141 are the cartan - killing metrics on the algebras @xmath117 and @xmath17 , respectively , and @xmath75 and @xmath142 are two arbitrary constants .",
    "these latter can always be reabsorbed into the normalization of the generators @xmath123 and correspondingly set to one . hence the algebra ( [ gengd3pre ] ) can always be put into the following elegant form : @xmath143 = f^{ab}_{\\phantom{ab}c } \\ , t^c   \\\\ \\nonumber & & [ l^x , l^y ] = f^{xy}_{\\phantom{xy}z } \\ , l^z , \\\\ & & \\nonumber [ t^a , w^{i\\alpha } ] = ( \\lambda^a)^\\alpha_{\\,\\,\\,\\beta } \\ ,",

    "it goes as follows .",
    "let @xmath382 be a @xmath383 matrix in the fundamental representation of @xmath384 .",
    "we map it into a matrix belonging to @xmath385 in the following way : @xmath386 then we use the cayley isomorphism relating @xmath387 and @xmath6 to obtain a real symplectic matrix @xmath388 representing the original @xmath384 element @xcite : @xmath389 this matrix construction is the explicit definition of the representation @xmath105 of the vectors .",

    "3 .   finally one further reduces the @xmath83 gravity coupled @xmath31-model to @xmath1 . in this step",
    "nothing new happens to the @xmath31model part of the lagrangian .",
    "the only novelty comes from the reduction of gravity which just produces the coupling to a dilaton field .    according to the above plan we introduce the reduction ansatz for the @xmath0 metric in the following form : @xmath413 where the index @xmath414 corresponds to the @xmath83 space - time dimensions",
    ", @xmath163 denotes the kaluza ",
    "klein scalar and @xmath415 denotes the kaluza - klein vector , for which we fix the following _ coulomb _ gauge @xmath416 . in this frame",
    "the dimensional reduction of the einstein term yields : @xmath417 = -2\\sqrt{g}\\left[{r}[g ] - \\frac{1}{4}(\\partial\\ln\\delta)^2 + \\delta^2g_{\\mu\\nu}g^{\\mu\\nu}\\right ] \\label{einstreduce}\\ ] ] where @xmath418 is the field strength of the kaluza klein vector field .",

    "so , differently from the case of pure gravity , in all supergravity models the affine extended dynkin diagram has a * new simple line * and * not * a * double line * as in the case of pure gravity .",

    "we have shown that there is a uniform pattern underlying such mechanism and that this is based on the coexistence of two non locally related dimensional reduction schemes , the ehlers and the matzner  misner scheme , respectively . in this way we have extended an original idea that nicolai had applied to pure gravity @xcite to the more general setup of all @xmath0 supergravities .",
    "in particular we have stressed the structural differences that arise in extended or matter coupled supergravity with respect to pure gravity and which are related to the presence of vector fields as well .",
    "this leads to the general form of the matzner ",
    "misner lagrangian which is different from the ehlers one and which to our knowledge had not been discussed so far in the literature .    the main motivation for our study is provided by the issue of cosmic billiards .",
    "indeed we plan to use our results in order to discuss how the compensator method to generate solutions of the first order equations which we introduced in @xcite and which we recently rediscussed in the context of the tits satake projection for non maximally split cosets @xcite can be extended to the infinite dimensional compact subalgebras of ka  moody algebras .",
    "alternatively the field theoretical understanding of the affine extensions is relevant in studying wave  solutions of supergravity , as already emphasized by nicolai @xcite and other authors . in this context special attention",
    "is to be devoted to the @xmath673-waves and to the penrose limit . indeed , as it will be pointed out in a forthcoming paper @xcite , the penrose limit in supergravity models can be thoroughly understood within the framework of _ lie algebra contractions _ and the relation between the isometry lie algebra of a wave solution and the duality ( affine ) lie algebra that generates the solution itself is a quite challenging conceptual issue , potentially very important in the quest for a deeper understanding of string theory and brane physics .",
    "it should also be stressed that while all purely time dependent solutions ( in particular cosmic billiards ) break all supersymmetries , wave  like solutions as the @xmath673waves can preserve several @xmath674 charges ( for a comprehensive review of the vast recent literature on supergravity @xmath673-wave solutions , see for instance@xcite ) .",
    "so an obvious research line streaming from our present results is the systematic investigation of wave solutions dynamically generated by the affine ka ",
    "moody extension of the duality algebra , along the lines already pioneered in pure gravity by and @xcite , and their classification according to killing spinors .",
    "it is easy to anticipate that the field theoretical mechanism underlying this is the coexistence of two dimensional reduction schemes , the ehlers , the analog of the matzner ",
    "misner one , in which we step directly down from @xmath0 to @xmath9 , by compactifying on a @xmath675torus . in this way",
    "we obtain a rank two @xmath31model @xmath676 which describes the degrees of freedom of pure gravity .",
    "this is also an obvious research line which we plan to carry out in the immediate future .",
    "let us finally mention that the analysis of cosmic billiards was so far given only in the context of ungauged supergravities .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the systematics of the affine extension of supergravity duality algebras when one steps down from @xmath0 to @xmath1 which is instrumental for the study of cosmic billiards . for all @xmath0 supergravities </S>",

    "<S> misner one . </S>",
    "<S> this and the existence of a generalized kramer  neugebauer non local transformation relating the two models , provide a chevalley - serre presentation of the affine ka  moody algebra which follows a universal pattern for all supergravities . </S>",
    "<S> this is an extension of the mechanism considered by nicolai for pure n=1 supergravity , but has general distinctive features in extended theories ( n@xmath33 ) related to the presence of vector fields and to their symplectic description . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the novelty is that in the general case the matzner - misner lagrangian is structurally different from the ehlers one , since half of the scalars are replaced by gauge @xmath4forms subject to @xmath5 electric  magnetic duality rotations representing in @xmath1 the @xmath6 rotations of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the role played by the symplectic bundle of vectors in this context , suggests that the mechanism of the affine extension can be studied also for @xmath7 supergravity , where one deals with geometries rather than with algebras , the scalar manifold being not necessarily a homogeneous manifold @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the mechanism of the affine extension commutes with the tits satake projection of the relevant duality algebras . </S>",
    "<S> this is very important for the issue of cosmic billiards , as we show in a separate paper . </S>",
    "<S> finally we also comment on the general field theoretical mechanism of the further hyperbolic extension obtained in @xmath9 , which we plan to analyze in detail in a forthcoming paper . </S>",
