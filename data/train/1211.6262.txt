    "since the discovery of superconductivity in the first layered compound , gamb there have been found many types of superconductors consisting of alternating conducting and insulating layers .",
    "examples include the high-@xmath3 cuprates,@xcite layered ruthenates,@xcite the iron pnictides and oxypnictides,@xcite , graphite intercalation compounds,@xcite crystalline organic metals , buzdin00,sing00,lebe00 the various types of artificial multi - layers , goz , sma , uno etc . amongst them , layered organic metals are distinctive for a number of reasons .",
    "most of them exhibit profound reduced dimensionality reflected in the very strong charge - transfer anisotropy .",
    "the interplay between electronic correlations and enhanced dimensionality effects leads to a broad range of physical properties observed in these materials .",
    "moreover , organic metals are often available in highly clean single crystals that enables one to perform detailed band - structure measurements and to study mechanisms of superconductivity in quasi - low - dimensional electronic systems .",
    "finally one of the most prominent property of organic layered superconductors is their robustness against high magnetic fields applied parallel to the conduction layers .",
    "commonly known examples include bechgaard salt superconductors ( tmtsf)@xmath4x , where anion x is pf@xmath5 , clo@xmath2etc . a very large upper critical fields , which exceed the pauli paramagnetic limit , for a magnetic field aligned parallel to their conducting layers were reported.@xcite in the compound ( tmtsf)@xmath4pf@xmath5 @xmath6  koe,@xcite which is more than 4 times larger than @xmath7  koe and an enhancement of almost two times over @xmath8  koe",
    "is observed in the compound ( tmtsf)@xmath4clo@xmath2 , @xmath9  koe.@xcite    in magnetic field the superconductivity in usual type ii superconductors is suppressed due to the diamagnetic currents and the pauli pair breaking effect for singlet pairing . in layered conductors the spatial orbital motion of electrons is mostly restricted to the conducting planes , when charge carrier hopping between adjacent layers is small , and the magnetic field applied precisely parallel to the conducting planes weakly affects the orbital motion of electrons .",
    "hence the orbital depairing is largely avoided ( there is no magnetic flux inside the 2d cooper pairs located in planes in such situation ) . moreover ,",
    "when the interlayer coherence length in a quasi-1d superconductor is comparable to the interlayer distance the field - induced quasi-2d ( 3d ) @xmath10 2d dimensional crossover occurs in a high magnetic field , restoring the bare critical temperature , @xmath0.@xcite    various theories based on different pairing symmetries predicting the existence of high - field superconducting state have been proposed previously . among them , a phase transition to an inhomogeneous fflo ( fulde - ferell - larkin - ovchinnikov ) phase for @xmath11 or @xmath12 , in which the the singlet superconducting ground state is characterized by the spatially modulated order parameter and the spin - polarization .",
    "therefore superconducting state can be stable beyond the field set by the pauli paramagnetic limit , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the superconducting gap at @xmath15.@xcite conditions for the stabilization of the fflo phase are rather stringent,@xcite namely ( _ i _ ) the orbital pair breaking effect should be sufficiently weaker than the pauli paramagnetic limit , the maki parameter @xmath16 ; ( _ ii _ ) the system should be in a clean limit.asla,taka,adac,akte03,houz,cui a growing body of experimental evidence for the fflo phase reported from a various measurement techniques supports this scenario.sing01,sing02,tana,bian,steg,uji01,shin02,lort,agos01,brow01,bergk,agos02,agos03,uji02 an alternative to the fflo phase is a triplet pairing state , when the pauli spin - splitting destructive mechanism is absent . within this pairing symmetry , as was shown by lebed,@xcite the superconducting state is always stable at low temperatures and exhibits a strong re - entrant behavior in high magnetic field .",
    "so far the re - entrant superconducting phase has not been experimentally identified , at least it is difficult to make more than a tentative judgement.@xcite nevertheless it can reveal itself in a number of nontrivial effects in singlet - paired organic materials in high magnetic fields.@xcite it was shown that it can appear in a hidden form and be responsible for an increase of the superconducting transition temperature in a magnetic field if the orbital effects of an electron motion are stronger than the pauli spin - splitting effects ( paramagnetic intrinsic meissner effect).@xcite    hitherto there is no experiment which unequivocally answer on the lingering question concerning the superconducting pairing symmetry in ( tmtsf)@xmath4x compounds .",
    "previously it was reported that the knight shift in ( tmtsf)@xmath4pf@xmath5  conductor does not change at transition temperature supporting the triplet scenario of pairing.@xcite however , later experiment with ( tmtsf)@xmath4clo@xmath2 conductor at low - field regime have revealed a clear change of the knight shift at the superconducting transition making possible consideration of the singlet scenario of pairing in such structures.shin02 in the high - field regime the knight shift is quite weak . on the other hand , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite a small fraction of the triplet pairing in the singlet paired superconductor strongly enhances the upper critical field and the triplet component of the order parameter is always generated in singlet superconductors due to the pauli paramagnetic spin - splitting effects.@xcite    in this paper we extend results presented in our previous letter , vrnkch01 and investigate the in - plane magnetic field - angle dependence of the onset of superconductivity in layered conductors in the conventional and the fflo modulated phases .",
    "for this purpose we provide the quasiclassical description of the anisotropy of the in - plane critical field in layered superconductors and generalize the lowerence - doniach model for the case of high magnetic fields .",
