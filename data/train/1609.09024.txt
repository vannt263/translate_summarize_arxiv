    "the scaling of the minimum energy reached in the sa runs is discussed in sec .",
    "e.      we code the spins @xmath117 of the model ( [ ham ] ) as bits of long ( 64-bit ) integers , thus using @xmath56 integers @xmath118 for a system of @xmath56 spins and propagating 64 replicas of the same system ( with the same random couplings ) .",
    "the bimodal couplings @xmath6 are also encoded as bits @xmath119 , and most of the operations involved in computing energy differences for the metropolis acceptance probabilities for single - spin flips ( with the same spin considered in all replicas ) can then be carried out simultaneously on all 64 replicas by using standard bit - vise logical operations on the stored integers .    in the beginning of each repetition of the sa ,",
    "we generate new random couplings and initialize the spins to a random configuration .",
    "we then carry out 10 mc sweeps at the initial temperature @xmath57 .",
    "we found that this small number of initial steps is sufficient for reaching very close to thermal equilibrium at this high temperature ( and note that any deviation from equilibrium at this stage can be regarded as just a different initial state and will not affect the scaling when @xmath7 at low velocities ) .",
    "in the subsequent sa run we carry out @xmath58 mc sweeps and lower the temperature after each sweep according to the protocol in eq .",
    "( [ tprotocol ] ) , carrying out measurements of the ea order parameter and the energy after the final @xmath0 sweep . to compute the ea order parameter ( [ ea ] ) we form 32 pairs out of the 64 replicas and again use bit operations , thus obtaining 32 contributions from each measurement .",
    "the safest way to ensure independent propagation of the replicas is to generate different random numbers for the final accept / reject step for each replica , in which case the generation of the random numbers consumes a large fraction of the computation time . strictly speaking ,",
    "uncorrelated replicas are required only when computing the ea order parameter ; any other correlations are unbiased ( provided that the random number generator is not flawed ) , thus not causing systematical error in the final results but potentially reducing the effective amount of statistical data .",
    "for example , if the same random number is used for each replica , if ever two replicas go into the same state they will stay in the same state for the remainder of the simulation , thus reducing the number of independent replicas .",
    "no statistical bias is introduced in computed mean values , however .",
    "once the system size is reasonably large , it is very unlikely for replicas to lock to each other in this way , and one can sefely use the same random numbers within the two groups of 32 replicas between which the ea order is computed .      in our pt simulations @xcite",
    ", we again use the bit representation but now all the bits @xmath120 correspond to different temperatures on a uniform grid , @xmath121 . attempts to swap spin configurations of runs at adjacent temperatures",
    "@xmath122 are carried out after each mc sweep over the spins .",
    "the goal of the pt simulations is to obtain @xmath7 equilibrium results for the ea order parameter and the ground state energy ( results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . for the latter , we do not use the thermal energy average but simply keep track of the lowest energy reached in each run and average it over the coupling samples .",
    "we here present results showing proper convergence as the number of sweeps is increased .",
    "we choose the lowest temperature @xmath123 such that the @xmath2 dependence of the ea order parameter is insignificant in the neighborhood of this temperature for the system sizes studied , i.e. , @xmath2 is below the size - dependent entropic cross - over temperature @xmath30 @xcite discussed in the main paper .",
    "the highest temperature should be high enough for the thermal fluctuations to migrate efficiently from high to low temperatures , thereby enhancing the ergodicity of the pt simulations relative to independent fixed-@xmath2 runs .",
    "significant migration of the fluctuations also necessitates a sufficiently small @xmath124 , and in principle optimal simulations would also have @xmath124 decreasing with @xmath49 and the number of temperatures increasing .",
    "here we use @xmath125 replicas and the spacing is @xmath126 or @xmath127 .",
    "figure [ ptconv ] shows examples of the convergence of the ea order parameter and the lowest energy as functions of the number of sweeps in the pt simulations .",
    "we use the same number of sweeps for equilibration and for collecting data .",
    "the @xmath88-axis of fig .",
    "[ ptconv ] corresponds to the sweeps for data collection only ( i.e. , the total number of sweeps is twice this number ) and each successive point corresponds to doubling the number of sweeps . for these system sizes , @xmath128 and @xmath129",

    "it is likely that the energy will converge _ slower _ than the energy for large sizes , as in the sa simulations ( see also sec .",

    "we have converged results for @xmath44 up to @xmath17 and for @xmath110 up to @xmath16 . to ensure that we obtain @xmath115 results , it is also important to check the temperature dependence of the results .",

    "according to the general non - equilibrium finite - size scaling form in @xcite , adapted to the present case where @xmath132 is replaced by @xmath98 , the squared order parameter @xmath133 can be written in the following way in three different regimes : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the generalized kz velocity separating the near - equilibrium and power - law scaling behaviors .",

    "we here focus on the ea order parameter but the scaling procedures are completely analogous for other quantities , e.g. , the excess energy for which we present some additional results in sec .  c-2 .    for convenience",

    "( [ eq : q_scaling ] ) , we could also just consider @xmath171 versus @xmath153 and extract the slope @xmath172 ( and again a good @xmath162 value would be an indication of being within the power - law scaling regime ) . the approach discussed here can , however , also be generalized to include low - velocity data , where the power - law scaling no longer holds but the behavior is described by the scaling function @xmath173 , of which the power - law constitutes the limiting form for large @xmath169 .",

    "the standard deviation of @xmath159 computed from the bootstrap samples directly gives the error bar ; in this case @xmath179 .",
    "this value is completely consistent with the value in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , but the error bar is larger because only the linear regime was used and the number of data points is smaller .    note that the same coupling realizations are used in sa runs with all velocities ( where @xmath62 is if the form @xmath180 for positive integers @xmath181 ) , and the data points for the same system size but different @xmath62 are therefore strongly correlated ( the sample - to - sample fluctuations being much larger than the mc sampling noise ) .",
    "the covariance predominantly corresponds to common up or down fluctuations of the value of the order parameter , and therefore the optimum line slope , as extracted above , is not significantly affected , and it is not necessary to use the full covariance matrix in the fitting procedure .",
    "the bootstrapping procedure properly account for the covariance since the same reandom bins are randomly chosen for all velocities for a given @xmath49 .    using the same system sizes and velocities and repeating the same procedures for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we obtain @xmath182 and @xmath183 . combining these results and performing a fit to the expected @xmath72 dependence of @xmath150 , eq .",

    "[ fig : a(r ) ] .",
    "these values are consistent with those presented in the main paper , but again the error bars are larger due to the smaller amount of data used",
    ". we can then conclude that the inclusion of also smaller sizes and lower velocities ( including some data away from the power - law regime ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] did not change the exponents to a noticable degree relative to the case here , where only large system sizes far from equilibrium were used . in the next section",

    "( [ eq : q_scaling ] ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] in the main paper , @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively , demonstrating the stability of the results .",
    "we did not include the smallest systems in the analysis in the main paper because , although the exponent values do not differ much , we can not obtain a statistically satisfactory value of the goodness of the fit ( @xmath162 per degree of freedom close to @xmath139 ) when all data are included in a common fit , given the small error bars of the sa data and small but statistically significant effects of neglected finite - size scaling corrections for the smaller systems .",
    "given the good agreement we have demonstrated here and in the main paper between different system sizes and velocity regimes , we judge that the significant difference between the dynamic exponent for the excess energy and the ea order parameter , @xmath193 , can not be explained by neglected scaling corrections .",
    "the dual time scales are therefore a real aspect of the relaxation of the 2d @xmath194 spin glass , and , as explained around fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in the main paper , this unusual physics also fits naturally within the droplet theory of the 2d spin glass .      for completeness we here present the data for @xmath63 and @xmath116 , analyzed in the same way as the @xmath60 data in figs .",

    "a ) . even in very slow annealings",
    "this energy is occasionally lower than the energy after the final mc step at @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the disorder - averaged @xmath109 should be lower than @xmath110 .",
    "an important question then is whether the scaling of the two quantities is the same or not .",
    "figure [ emin ] shows results for @xmath60 , scaled using the same exponents as in fig .  [ fig3 ] in the main paper .",
    "the scaling collapse is still very good , and the optimized scaling exponent for this case is also statistically equal to the one obtained before .",
    "overall the minimum energy values are , as expected , below those for the mean energy . with the range of system sizes used here we can see the full equilibrium behavior ( the flat portion , where the value corresponds to the prefactor of the @xmath38 correction in fig .  [ fig1 ] of the main paper ) as well as the cross - over into the power - law scaling regime . in the graph",
    "we also draw a straight line with exactly the same parameters as the line drawn through the power - law scaling portion of the collapsed mean energy data in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in @xmath195",
    "we observe that larger systems are needed to observe the same slope ",
    "we see that the scaling function ( onto which the data collapse ) exhibits some curvature .",
    "nevertheless , with increasing size the functional form appears to approach a line with the same slope as before .",
    "it is possible that it actually approaches exactly the same line ( not just the same slope but also the same constant ) as the one for @xmath196 in fig .",
    "if so the asymptotic power - law scaling of the two quantities would be exactly the same , and the advantages ( in optimization applications ) of monitoring @xmath108 instead of @xmath197 would only appear as the behavior crosses over toward the equilibrium behavior .",
    "we conclude that the minimum energy collected during sa runs converges to the ground state energy on the same time scale @xmath198 as the convergence of the mean energy .",
    "the scaling functions are different , reflecting an overall lower value of the minimum energy than the mean energy for given scaled velocity @xmath199 . in fig .",

    "<S> fixing @xmath51 we can reduce the error bar on the dynamic exponent ; @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> using small systems close to equilibrium gives a similar value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the lowest energy @xmath108 reached in each sa run . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , @xmath109 is somewhat lower than @xmath110 for each @xmath111 , but the scaling exponent @xmath104 is still the same . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling function @xmath112 is different for the two quantities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of two different dynamic exponents contradicts the standard picture of relaxation , where the slowest mode is associated with the fluctuation of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the energy to the order parameter ( via defects ) normally implies that the asymptotic energy relaxation is also determined by @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the standard scenario , there is a single exponent governing the dynamic scaling of all quantities , except ones that are explicitly constructed to only sense _ faster _ modes .    </S>",
    "<S> the dual dynamic scales in the @xmath29 model should be related to the phenomenon of droplet entropy stabilizing the ea order parameter when @xmath7 in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the backbone of the spin - glass cluster has a fractal dimension @xmath113 @xcite and , thus , does not have long - range order on its own @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ground states are strongly clustered within a small region ( and its spin - reflected counterpart ) , which implies that these states are related to each other by flipping small ( compared to the system size ) droplets ; flipping large droplet throws the system into atypical regions that are statistically inisgnificant in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> although the absence of order at @xmath8 implies that low - energy excitations must be spread out over a large region of the configuration space , the ground state region should also have a much higher density of low - energy states than other regions ( since these states can be obtained from the ground states by flipping small clusters ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have a region of typical ground states and low - energy states , illustrated in fig .  [ fig4 ] , and the large entropy drives the system toward this region under annealing . in the typical region , the ea order parameter , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ea ] ) , has essentially the same distribution for replicas in low - energy states as for those strictly in ground states , and , therefore , the order parameter can converge even when a significant fraction of the replicas remain in excited states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our scaling results show that the final relaxation of the system involves transitions between excited states into ground states located in the same high - density region , and that the time scale for this is significantly longer ( approximately by a factor @xmath114 ) than that for reaching the high - density region .    </S>",
    "<S> -2 mm    -2 mm    dynamic scaling is also interesting in the context of optimization . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been argued that the best measure of optimization is not necessarily just the energy ( the standard cost function ) , but the stability of the solution is also important and should be enhanced if the solution belongs to a dense region of similar soloutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a method was presented to enhance the ability to reach such regions , by using coupled replicas of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d @xmath29 ising spin glass is an extreme case of a system harboring a dense region of low - energy states , and we have shown here that sa finds this region efficiently even without artificial replicating , as evidenced by the entropy - driven order parameter converging faster than the energy . in optimization , </S>",
    "<S> one may be willing to accept a slightly sub - optimal solution , as measured by the energy , for a solution in a dense region that can be found on a much shorter time scale . </S>",
    "<S> clustering of solutions is also important when discussing the efficiency of qa protocols , where the measure of success is also ambiguous and solution stability may be a desirable feature . </S>",
    "<S> qa of systems with discrete coupling distributions may also be affected by dual time scales , due to mechanisms similar to those discussed here .    </S>",
    "<S> it would clearly be interesting to also study the kz dynamics of the model with normal - distributed couplings , which has a unique ground state and likely different dynamic scaling . </S>",
    "<S> kz scaling of @xmath115 sa simulations can also be used in other systems that do not order at @xmath8 . </S>",
