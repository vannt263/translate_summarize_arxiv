    "one of the most paradigmatic models of multi - component system dynamics within integrable nonlinear systems and wave phenomena is the so - called manakov model  @xcite .",
    "this is a vector variant of the famous nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation  @xcite , featuring equal ( nonlinear ) interactions within a certain component and across the different ones .",
    "vector solitons of this model have attracted considerable interest , both in the case of focusing  @xcite and defocusing  @xcite nonlinearities .    in the present setting ,",
    "the case that will be of interest is that of the defocusing nonlinearity , as referred to in nonlinear optics ; on the other hand , in the context of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite , this case corresponds to repulsive interatomic interactions , and is thus referred to as repulsive nonlinearity . in the original , one - dimensional ( 1d ) manakov system",
    "a particularly intriguing structure that is supported is the so - called dark - bright ( db ) soliton . here",
    ", the bright soliton component , which would not otherwise exist in the defocusing setting , arises because of an effective potential well created by the dark soliton through the inter - component interaction . in that light , db solitons can be considered as `` symbiotic '' structures .",
    "the extensive study of such states  @xcite , has stemmed in good measure from their potential applications in optics , where dark solitons were proposed to effectively act as adjustable waveguides for weak signals  @xcite . in this field , the theoretical / analytical developments were ( already a couple of decades ago ) supplemented by experimental work in photorefractive media pioneering the observation of db structures  @xcite",
    ".    our work is largely inspired by the setting of atomic condensates , where such structures have been explored in multiple recent experiments .",
    "the latter , were chiefly focusing on the dynamics of pseudo - spinor ( two - component ) atomic gases , featuring two hyperfine states of the same atom species , such as @xmath1rb . here , the early theoretical prediction of db solitons @xcite was  after a considerable hiatus  followed by the experimental realization by the hamburg group  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , led to numerous further directions of explorations , many of which were pursued at pullman  @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , robust db solitons were created by a phase - imprinting technique and their robust oscillations were probed in a quasi-1d parabolic trap . on the other hand ,",
    "in subsequent experiments , different types of structures , including db and dark - dark ( dd ) solitons  @xcite , emerged spontaneously via instabilities in counterflow dynamical scenarios .    in the bec setting , one of the significant advantages of the spinor gases is that , naturally , the coefficients of inter- and intra - component interactions are very close to being identical ; in fact , the differences are not more than a few percent , which is important , e.g. , in phase separation  @xcite . hence , the model is naturally proximal ( in as far as its nonlinearity coefficients are concerned ) to the manakov one .",
    "remarkably , the manakov case bears an additional symmetry under rotations , i.e. , the model is invariant under the action of the @xmath2 lie group .",
    "this invariance has been employed in order to generate unitary ( in fact , chiefly orthogonal ) rotations of states , such as the db solitons .",
    "the resulting waveforms , produced even experimentally  @xcite , are a particular form of dd solitons . depending on the frequency ( chemical potential , as we will refer to it below ) , the resulting evolution of the components can be intrinsically oscillatory i.e. , breathing in their atomic density . while the transformation is exact only in the manakov case ,",
    "weak deviations from this integrable limit relevant to the atomic species appear to maintain such dd states as sufficiently robust nonlinear excitations in order for them to be experimentally observable .    in the present work , we extend the consideration of such states to higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , in section ii , we revisit the mathematical framework of the @xmath2 and more specifically the @xmath0 group generator that produces the relevant invariance . for completeness , and also to make connections with earlier work , in section iii.a we start with the 1d case by briefly discussing the dd soliton , stemming from the rotation of the db one .",
    "we then examine the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , by considering vortex - bright solitons .",
    "the latter , involve a vortex in one component trapping a bright soliton in the other component  @xcite .",
    "these structures , are also known as `` filled core vortices '' ( that were experimentally observed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , `` half - quantum vortices ''  @xcite or `` baby skyrmions ''  @xcite , and their stability and dynamics , have been studied , respectively , in refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "rotating these in section iii.b , we obtain ( by analogy to the dd states ) vortex - vortex structures with their constituent vortices rotating around one another .",
    "finally , we turn to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) setting , and examine the cases of vortex lines and vortex rings , which are the prototypical excitations therein  @xcite . once again",
    ", our starting point is the vortex - line , or vortex - ring in the first component , that traps a ( line or ring , respectively ) bright soliton in the second component .",
    "the rotation of such a stationary state allows us to capture a vector vortex - ring state with its own intrinsic vibrating dynamics , as we will illustrate in what follows in section iii.c .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize our findings and present a number of possibilities for future study .",
    "we start by presenting our model , as well as the analytical and computational setup .",
    "we consider the coupled defocusing nls system written in dimensionless form  @xcite as    @xmath3    [ start_manakov ]    where @xmath4 stands for the standard laplace operator in the respective dimension of the problem , the interaction coefficients are @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , with @xmath7 , and the external potential @xmath8 assumes the standard harmonic form of @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and normalized trap strength @xmath11 ( note that in 1d , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and so on ) . the fields ( representing the macroscopic wavefunctions in becs  @xcite ) @xmath14 in eqs .",
    "( [ 1])-([2 ] ) are assumed to carry the dark ( with @xmath15 `` subscript ) and bright ( with @xmath16 '' subscript ) soliton components , respectively .",
    "the starting point for our discussion below is the construction of stationary solutions .",
    "such stationary solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) with chemical potentials @xmath17 are found by employing the well - known ansatz , @xmath18 where @xmath19 stand for the steady states of the corresponding solitary waveforms .",

    "in fact , this result does not depend on the dimensionality of the system or the presence of an external potential ( with the constraint that it should be the same for the two components ) , as long as @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , let us first recall that a general matrix element of @xmath2 has the form @xmath22 where bar denotes complex conjugate , and complex constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 are such that @xmath25 .",
    "then , it can be shown that if the ( pseudo- ) spinor @xmath26 is a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ start_manakov ] ) , then , @xmath27 is also a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ start_manakov ] ) . in our considerations for what follows",
    ", we will focus on the special case of an @xmath0 rotation parametrized by an angle @xmath28 with a @xmath29 matrix representation @xmath30 corresponding to the choice of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . then , once stationary solutions in the form of eq .",

    "the above equations indicate that the total density , @xmath39 is time - independent ( recall that @xmath40 depend only on @xmath41 ) , while the individual densities @xmath42 of the rotated states are periodic functions of time .",
    "in fact , the relevant angular frequency , which constitutes the internal beating frequency of the rotated structures , is @xmath43 , while the period of internal vibrations is given by : @xmath44    our algorithm for the construction of the rotated ( beating ) dark - dark solitons and generalizations thereof in higher dimensions is described as follows . at first",
    ", we identify steady states @xmath40 to eq .",
    "( [ stat_nlse ] ) using a newton - raphson method for a given set of chemical potentials @xmath17 .",
    "this state will be of the dark - bright variety in 1d , of the vortex - bright in 2d , and of the vortex - line ( vl)bright ( vlb ) and vortex - ring ( vr)bright ( vrb ) in 3d . in the majority of the cases studied below , we consider two cases as far as the interaction coefficients are concerned ( unless otherwise noted ) :    * @xmath21 , i.e. , equal interaction coefficients , and * unequal ones with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",

    ", we also explore the scenarios in the absence of a trap ( i.e. , for @xmath53 ) .",
    "we should also notice that in the manakov case where the transformation is exact , the stability of the rotated states is inherited from their stationary counterparts and , consequently , all the dynamical solutions considered are stable .",
    "on the other hand , for the case with @xmath54 , the situation may be more subtle as will be explained in more detail through our numerical results below .",
    "we start by considering , at first , the 1d case .",
    "it is relevant to mention that while corresponding analysis has been presented earlier , e.g. , in refs .",

    "[ fig1 ] corresponds to the case of equal interaction coefficients , while results obtained using unequal interaction coefficients are presented in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] with dashed - dotted black and blue lines , respectively , while their rotated siblings by @xmath55 and @xmath56 are presented with solid black and blue lines therein .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the stability trait of the original , i.e. , unrotated db soliton states employed here ( with and without a trap ) has been extensively studied ; for a recent example see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "this way , the underlying unrotated states for values of the chemical potentials of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are stable .",
    "having identified the states of interest , we now turn our discussion to the dynamical evolution of the ( @xmath0 ) rotated variants of db solitons , namely the dd states , and monitor their oscillatory development . specifically , the middle and right panels of figs .  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] present the spatio - temporal evolution of the densities @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively ( hereafter , for simplicity , we omit primes in the rotated fields ) . from these panels , the development of the well - known beating dd soliton  @xcite , showcasing a breathing oscillation of the corresponding individual densities , is clearly evident . furthermore",
    ", the oscillation persists over a wide time interval of integration forward in time ( note the range of the @xmath61-axis in these panels ) , while these findings indicate the robustness of such states which is also expected since they were also observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "let us highlight some differences between the integrable ( i.e. , equal interaction coefficients ) and the non - integrable cases , that are apparent not only in the 1d setting , but in the 2d as well as 3d settings which will be discussed next .",

    "we note in passing that small amount of radiation is observed as well ( see , e.g. , panels ( e ) and ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , which affects the period of oscillations .",

    ", the excitation persists .",
    "while the presence of the trap does not seem to dramatically affect its ( internal ) dynamics , nevertheless , when departing from the equal interaction case , it does appear to affect its details .",
    "notice , in particular , the vibration frequency [ cf .",
    "the beating differences between the first and third , second and fourth row of panels in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ] .      in this section ,",
    "we take a step further and discuss rotated vortex - bright soliton complexes in 2d , by considering specific cases spanning various possibilities .",

    "as mentioned in section  ii , its rotated vv counterpart inherits these traits .",
    "furthermore , the internal period @xmath68 of vibration of the vv state in the equal interactions coefficients case is given by eq .",
    "( [ period ] ) , as shown in the previous section . in our numerical results",
    "the period calculated numerically follows this analytical prediction , a feature that we have used as a benchmark of our numerical method @xcite .",
    "once again , the presence of the trap does not appear to significantly affect the motion of the vortices in the case of equal interaction coefficients : the vortex constituents of the vv state in each component continue to blithely orbit around each other both in the presence and in the absence of the trap .",
    "specifically , snapshots of the densities are presented in panels ( a ) of figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] at each @xmath61 which is equal to one quarter of the period , i.e. , @xmath50 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( with @xmath73 in these examples ) .",
    "this way , the vortex  vortex complex performs a circular motion as time evolves ( see , the insets therein ) and returns to its original position at @xmath72 ( see , the last column of panels ( a ) ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ( see , the range of @xmath61 axes therein ) suggesting that the underlying states are indeed robust .",
    "arguably more intriguing , however , appears to be the case of unequal interaction coefficients . in this case , and in the presence of the trap , the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ; see , also ,  @xcite for a complete movie of the dynamics in this case . although the initial vortex ",
    "bright soliton is stable ( in the realm of linear stability analysis ) , its vortex  vortex sibling appears to undergo modifications of its density profile . at first , the vortex  vortex complex follows a circular motion , where the period increases compared to the analytical prediction of eq .",
    "( [ period ] ) , due to the unequal interaction coefficients .",
    "in analogy to the 1d setting , this is expected based on the fact that the @xmath2-invariance is broken .",
    "then , the configuration starts changing in shape ( see the panels in the second column of the figure ) leading at @xmath74 the bright soliton in the second component to disappear , while in the first component the vortex structure can not be straightforwardly discerned in the density .",
    "however , the complex in the second component regains ( qualitatively ) its structural form back around @xmath75 , leading to the recurrence of the vv state ( in a rotated form ) .",
    "it is evident in the snapshots ( especially of the second and third column of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) that the dynamics features phase separation phenomena analyzed in detail , e.g. , in the experimental ( and computational ) analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite ; see also  @xcite .",
    "indeed , while the rotation of the vv pattern persists ( or , at least , recurs ) , the overall density pattern develops the target patterns analyzed in ( the planar projections associated with ) ref .",
    "@xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "our conclusion in that connection is that the robustness of the rotational state is , at least in part , affected by the location of the relevant interaction coefficients with respect to the miscibility / immiscibility transition  associated with crossing the critical point @xmath76 of the immiscibility parameter @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "finally , we study the effect of @xmath0 rotations to construct vorticity - bearing vector structures in 3d . in particular",

    "@xcite for a more complete movie of the dynamics .",
    "we have also verified that similar robust dynamics also hold for @xmath49 .",
    "hence , such vl  vl states are natural candidates for observation in the dynamics of the system  although , of course , it does not escape us that unequal interaction coefficients may again impose density modulations via phase - separation phenomena ; we comment on this further below .    .",

    "our numerical findings revealed that the complexes considered in this work are robust ( over a wide time interval ) , suggesting possibilities of observing the underlying states experimentally in bose - einstein condensates .",
    "while our starting point was the revisiting of the simpler ( and experimentally observed ) dark - dark solitons , we illustrated that the transformation and its feature of potentially producing breathing states from stationary ones are independent of dimension . while analytical solutions are not available in higher dimensions in order to subject them to the transformation , it is straightforward to obtain numerical ones and not only evolve them dynamically , but also predict on the basis of the difference of their chemical potentials , the period of the resulting periodic pattern .",
    "we performed this step for a vortex  bright soliton in 2d , obtaining a vortex  vortex state in that system , while in 3d , the robustness of both vortex - line  soliton and of vortex - ring ",

    ", while exact in the context of the manakov model , as we showcased via select dynamical examples , are no longer so in the case of unequal interaction coefficients .",
    "in fact , it is evident that in such cases , even weak deviations from the miscibility - immiscibility threshold that the manakov system represents ( as is relevant for atomic becs ) may give rise to spontaneously phase - separating patterns for homogeneous or sufficiently weakly trapped systems , on top of which the vibration of the coherent structures of interest may take place . this is a natural direction for further quantitative exploration , i.e. , a more quantitative identification of the boundaries of robustness of the states developed herein .",
    "such variation is quite accessible presently , e.g. , via feshbach resonance techniques @xcite .",
