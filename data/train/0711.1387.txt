    "accretion disks are now widely believed to be energy sources in various active phenomena in the universe ( see kato et al .",
    "2007 for a review ) .",
    "relating to energetic accretion disks , accretion disk winds have been extensively examined in connection with astrophysical jets and outflows : in bipolar outflows from young stellar objects ( ysos ) , in outflows from cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and supersoft x - ray sources ( ssxss ) , in relativistic jets from microquasars ( @xmath0qsos ) , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , quasars ( qsos ) , and in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . in particular , intense radiation fields of luminous supercritical accretion disks",
    "may be responsible for relativistic jets from super - eddington sources , such as luminous @xmath0qsos , grs  1915@xmath1105 and ss  433 , luminous qsos , 3c  273 , and energetic grbs ( see , e.g. , fukue 2004 for references ) .",
    "furthermore , energetic emissions from relativistic jets have been examined , relating to , e.g. , gamma - ray blazars and gamma - ray bursts ( dermer , schlickeiser 1993 , 2002 ; dermer 1998 ; bttcher , dermer 2002 ; dermer et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in such circumstances ,",
    "radiative transfer in accretion disk winds as well as accretion disks becomes more and more important .",
    "radiative transfer in the standard disk has been investigated in relation to the structure of a static disk atmosphere and the spectral energy distribution from the disk surface ( e.g. , meyer , meyer - hofmeister 1982 ; cannizzo , wheeler 1984 ) .",
    "furthermore , gray and non - gray models of accretion disks were constructed under numerical treatments ( ki , hubeny 1986 ; shaviv , wehrse 1986 ; adam et al .",
    "1988 ; mineshige , wood 1990 ; ross et al . 1992 ; shimura , takahara 1993 ; hubeny , hubeny 1997 , 1998 ; hubeny et al . 2000 , 2001 ; davis et al . 2005 ; hui et al .",
    "2005 ) and under analytical ones ( hubeny 1990 ; artemova et al . 1996 ; fukue , akizuki 2006a ) .",
    "radiative transfer in the accretion disk wind , on the other hand , has not been well considered both in the non - relativistic and relativistic regimes .",
    "for example , transformation properties of disk radiation fields in the proper frame of a relativistic jet were examined by , e.g. , dermer and schlickeiser ( 2002 ) . in these earlier works , however , the radiation fields are set to be external sources , and the radiation transfer was not considered .",
    "recently , radiative transfer in a moving disk atmosphere was firstly investigated in the subrelativistic regime ( fukue 2005a , 2006a ) , and in the relativistic regime ( fukue 2005b , 2006b ; fukue , akizuki 2006b ) . in these studies , however , only the radiative moments were obtained under the moment formalism , and the specific intensity was not solved .",
    "hence , in fukue ( 2007 ) the specific intensity from an accretion disk wind was obtained in the subrelativistic regime , where the flow speed @xmath2 is of the order of @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    ", we thus extend the previous work .",
    "namely , we examine radiative transfer in the relativistic accretion disk wind , which is assumed to blow off from the luminous disk in the vertical direction ( plane - parallel approximation ) , with the relativistic speed up to the order of @xmath4 .    in the next section",
    "we describe the basic equations . in section 3 ,",
    "we show analytical solutions of the specific intensity .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "let us suppose a luminous flat disk , deep inside which gravitational or nuclear energy is released via viscous heating or other processes .",
    "the radiation energy is transported in the vertical direction , and the disk gas , itself , also moves in the vertical direction as a _ disk wind _ due to the action of radiation pressure ( i.e. , plane - parallel approximation ) . for simplicity , in the present paper , the radiation field",
    "is considered to be sufficiently intense that both the gravitational field of , e.g. , the central object and the gas pressure can be ignored .",
    "we also assume the gray approximation , where the opacities do not depend on the frequency . as for the order of the flow velocity @xmath2",
    ", we consider the fully special relativistic regime .",
    "the radiative transfer equations are given in several literatures ( chandrasekhar 1960 ; mihalas 1970 ; rybicki , lightman 1979 ; mihalas , mihalas 1984 ; shu 1991 ; kato et al .",
    "1998 , 2007 ; peraiah 2002 ; castor 2004 ) .",

    "it should be briefly remarked on the frequency dependence ; i.e. , the frequency - dependent intensity @xmath91 .",
    "as long as the opacity is gray , the spectral transformation is determined by the relativistic effect in the present situation .",
    "namely , for the frequency - integrated intensity the relativistic invariant is @xmath92 , and this effect appears in solution ( [ i_sol13 ] ) and other equations as a factor of @xmath93 ^ 4 $ ] .",
    "since the relativistic invariant for the frequency - dependent intensity is @xmath94 , the corresponding factor should be changed as @xmath93 ^ 3 $ ] . on the other hand , the relativistic modification in the optical depth discussed above is not changed in the frequency - dependent case .",
    "hence , the present results may be valid for the frequency - dependent emergent intensity ; e.g. , the incident intensity @xmath95 would be boosted in the polar direction , according to solution ( [ i_sol13 ] ) , but @xmath93 ^ 4 $ ] is replaced by @xmath93 ^ 3 $ ] .    the present study can be applied to energetic jets in , e.g. , gamma - ray blazars and gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the effect of the relativistic jets on the emergent spectrum has been studied in several literatures ( dermer , schlickeiser 1993 , 2002 ; dermer 1998 ; bttcher , dermer 2002 ; dermer et al .",
    "2007 ) , in these earlier works , however , the radiation transfer was not treated at all .",
    "hence , the present approach may be very usefull in these fields of active phenomena .",
    "the radiative transfer problem investigated in the present paper must be quite _ fundamental problems _ for accretion disk physics and astrophysical jet formation . in onder",
    "to demonstrate the existence of the relativistic peaking effect , we have imposed various assumptions , including a constant flow speed , gray approximation , no heating source , and so on . by relaxing these assumptions and integrating the relativistic transfer equation numerically ,",
    "we could obtain the emergent intensity and spectra more quantitatively .",
    "these are left as future works .",
