    "high - mass star forming regions have been known for many years as ob associations and hii regions and they have been observed quite extensively on various aspects .",
    "however , the census of low mass stars in such regions has not been possible until recently .",
    "recent advancement in detectors have permitted the detection of substantial population of low mass stars in ob associations .",
    "recently relatively large number of low mass stars have been detected in a few ob associations ( e.g. upper scorpios , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 ori regions ; preibisch & zinnecker 1999 , dolan & mathieu 2002 ) . since this realization",
    ", surveys have demonstrated that the initial mass functions ( imfs ) are essentially the same in all star forming regions .",
    "the apparent difference may be due mainly to the inherent low percentage of high mass stars and the incomplete survey of low mass stars in high - mass star forming regions ( e.g. kroupa 2002 , preibisch & zinneker 1999 , hillenbrand 1997 , massey et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the massive stars of ob associations have strong influence and significantly affect the entire star - forming region .",
    "strong uv radiation from massive stars could evaporate nearby clouds and consequently terminate star formation .",
    "herbig ( 1962 ) suggested that low and intermediate - mass stars form first and with the formation of most massive star in the region , the cloud gets disrupted and star formation ceases .",
    "alternatively shock waves associated with the ionization front may squeeze molecular cloud and induce subsequent star formation .",
    "elmegreen & lada ( 1977 ) proposed the expanding ionization fronts play a constructive role to incite a sequence of star - formation activities in the neighborhood .",
    "the question however is : could both of these effects occur in different parts of the same star - forming regions ?",
    "recent studies have shown cases where massive stars ionize adjacent clouds revealing embedded stars ( e.g. the eagle nebula ; hester et al .",
    "preibisch & zinnecker ( 1999 ) show that star formation in the upper scorpius ob association was likely triggered by a nearby supernovae .",
    "recently lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have found evidence for triggered star formation in the bright - rimmed clouds ( brcs ) in the vicinity of o stars .",
    "pandey et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2005 ) found that star formation in few young clusters may be a continuous process .",
    "for example , in the case of ngc 663 , star formation seems to have taken place non - coevally in the sense that formation of low mass stars precedes the formation of most massive stars . whereas , in the case of ngc 654 and ngc 3603 , formation of low mass stars did not cease after the formation of most massive stars in the clusters .",
    "the sharpless region s171 is a large hii region associated with the cepheus ob4 stellar association ( yang & fukui 1992 ) .",
    "the star cluster be 59 is located at the center of the nebulous region with nine o7 - b3 stars .",
    "the physical properties of the ionized gas have been investigated in radio continuum and recombination lines .",
    "( e.g. felli et al .",
    "1977 , rossano et al . 1980 ,",
    "harten et al . 1981 ) .",
    "yang & fukui ( 1992 ) have mapped the molecular gas distribution using the @xmath15 lines of @xmath16co and @xmath17co emission , indicating that be 59 generates the ionization front on the surface of two dense molecular clouds .",
    "they suggested that the dense gas is in contact with the continuum source and ionization front is deriving shocks into the clumps .",
    "as the shock penetrates into the molecular clumps , it forms a compressed gas layer which is unstable against self - gravity ( elmegreen 1989 , 1998 ) .",
    "one can expect that a new generation of stars may form from the compressed gas layer .",
    "thus the s171 region provides an opportunity to make a comprehensive exploration of the effects of massive stars on low mass star formation . therefore in this paper",
    ", we present a multi - wavelength study of the star forming region s171 .",
    "we have also carried out slitless spectroscopy to identify pre - main sequence h@xmath12 emission stars in the region . in section 2",
    "we present optical ccd photometric and slitless spectroscopic observations and brief description of data reduction . in sect 3 ,",
    "we discuss archival data set used in the present study . in the ensuing sections we discuss results and star formation scenario in",
    "the be 59 region .",
    "the ccd @xmath19 observations of the cluster were obtained using the 105-cm schmidt telescope of the kiso observatory on november 19 - 21 , 2001 .",
    "the ccd camera used a site 2048 @xmath20 2048 tk2048e chip having a pixel size @xmath21 m . at the schmidt focus ( f/3.1 ) each pixel corresponds to 1.5 arcsec and",
    "the entire chip covers a field of @xmath22 arcmin@xmath23 on the sky .",
    "the read - out noise and gain of the ccd are 23.2 @xmath24 and 3.4 @xmath25 respectively . a number of short and deep exposure frames were taken .",
    "the log of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "a number of bias and dome flat frames were also taken during the observing runs . the observations were standardized by observing 14 standard stars in sa95 field ( landolt 1992 ) with brightness @xmath26 and colour @xmath27 on 2001 november 22 .    the data analysis was carried out at aryabhatta research institute of observational sciences ( aries ) , nainital .",
    "initial processing of the data was done using iraf and eso - midas data reduction software packages .",
    "the photometry was carried out by using daophot - ii software ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) was obtained for each frame using several uncontaminated stars .",
    "fwhm of the star images was @xmath28 .",
    "when bright stars were saturated on deep exposure frames , their magnitudes were taken from short exposure frames .",
    "calibration of the instrumental to the standard system was done using the procedure outlined by stetson ( 1992 ) .",
    "the details of the procedure , zero - point constants , colour coefficients and extinction coefficients are given elsewhere ( sharma et al .",
    "1 shows the standardization residuals , @xmath29 , between the standard and transformed @xmath30 magnitudes and @xmath31 and @xmath32 colours of standard stars .",
    "the standard deviation in @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are 0.010 , 0.055 , 0.023 and 0.023 mag respectively .",
    "the photometric errors increase with @xmath30 magnitude and becomes larger ( @xmath37 mag ) for stars fainter than @xmath38 mag .",
    "the measured photometric data along with positions of all the stars are given in table 2 , a sample of which is given in this paper .",
    "to study the luminosity function ( lf ) and mass function ( mf ) it is very important to make necessary corrections in the data sample to take into account the incompleteness that may occur for various reasons ( e.g. due to the crowding of stars ) .",
    "we used the addstar routine of daophot ii to determine the completeness factor ( cf ) .",
    "the procedure has been outlined in detail in our earlier work ( pandey et al .",
    "2001 , 2005 ) .",
    "the sample is complete at the brighter magnitude level ( @xmath39 )",
    ". the incompleteness increases with increasing magnitude as expected ( e.g. cf @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) .",
    "the observations were also carried out in slitless mode with a grism as the dispersing element using the himalayan faint object spectrograph camera ( hfosc ) instrument at the 2-m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) on 22 september 2004 and 7 - 9 january 2005 .",
    "this mode of observation using the hfosc yields an image where the stellar images are replaced by their spectra .",
    "a combination of a wide h@xmath12 filter ( @xmath42 ) and grism 5 ( 5200 - 10300 @xmath43 ) of hfosc was used without any slit .",
    "the resolution of the grism is 870 .",
    "the central @xmath44 pixels of the @xmath45 ccd were used for data acquisition .",
    "the pixel size is 15 micron with the scale of 0.297 arcsec / pixel .",
    "we secured three spectroscopic frames of 7 min exposure with grism in and three direct frames of 1 minute exposure with the grism out .",
    "the seeing during the observations was @xmath1 1.5 to 2.3 arcsec .",
    "the co - added spectroscopic frames yield limiting magnitude of about @xmath46 for continuum detection .",
    "the slitless spectra thus obtained were used to identify the emission line stars in the field of the cluster .",
    "the data were reduced following the procedures with iraf as described by ogura et al .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) has also been calculated as described by ogura et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and relevant information s about the detected @xmath47 stars in be 59 are given in table 3 .",
    "the frequency distribution of the h@xmath12 ews reveals that 23% of h@xmath12 stars have ew @xmath48 which is significantly less than the fraction ( 60% ) reported by herbig ( 1998 ) in the case of ic 348 .",
    "the possible cause for this deficiency is the poor detection efficiency of smaller ews in the present survey due to seeing conditions .",

    "the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) surveyed the galactic plane within the range @xmath58 in the four mid - infrared bands between 8 and 21 @xmath59 m at a spatial resolution of @xmath60 ( price et al .",
    "two of these bands ( a and c ) with @xmath61 corresponding to 8.28(3.36 ) @xmath59 m and 12.13(1.71 ) @xmath59 m include several unidentified infrared emission bands ( uibs ) at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.7 11.3 , and 12.7 @xmath59 m .",
    "msx images in the four bands around the cluster region were used to study the emission from the uibs and to estimate the spatial distribution of optical depth of the warm interstellar dust .    the data from the iras survey in the four bands ( 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath59 m ) for the region around be 59 were hires processed ( aumann et al .",
    "1990 ) to obtain high angular resolution maps .",
    "these maps have been used to study the spatial distribution of optical depth of the cold interstellar dust .",
    "the iras point sources have also been identified in the cluster region and their details are given in table 4 .",
    "internal interaction of two - body relaxation due to encounters among members stars and external tidal forces due to the galactic disk or giant molecular clouds can significantly influence the morphology of the clusters .",
    "however , in the case of young clusters , where dynamical relaxation is not important because of cluster s young age , the stellar distribution can be considered as the initial morphology of the cluster that should be governed by the initial conditions in the parent molecular cloud ( chen et al .",
    "2004 ) . to study the morphology of the clusters we plotted isodensity contours for the sample of main sequence ( ms ) ( cf .",

    "similarly the isodensity contours using the 2mass data are also plotted in fig . 2 _",
    "( right panel)_. both nir and optical data indicate an elongated morphology for the cluster .      to find out the extent of the cluster we used optical data of probable ms stars ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 mag ) as well as 2mass data ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the center of the cluster was determined using the stellar density distribution in a 100 pixel wide strip along both x and y directions around an initially eye estimated center .",
    "the point of maximum density obtained by fitting gaussian distribution is considered as the center of cluster .",
    "the x , y pixel coordinates of the cluster for optical data are found to be @xmath66 respectively , which correspond to @xmath67 , @xmath68 .    to determine the radial surface density we divided the cluster into a number of concentric circles .",
    "projected radial stellar density in each concentric annulus was obtained by dividing the number of stars by its area .",
    "densities thus obtained are plotted in fig .",
    "the error bars are derived assuming that the number of stars in a concentric annulus follows the poisson statistics .",
    "the horizontal dashed line in the plot indicates the density of contaminating field stars , which is obtained from the region ( about 1.5 cluster radius ) outside the cluster area .",
    "the extent of the cluster @xmath69 is defined as the point at which the radial density becomes constant and merges with the field star density .",
    "the radial extent of the cluster @xmath69 from optical data and nir 2mass data is estimated as @xmath70 ( 2.9 pc ) for a distance of 1.0 kpc .",
    "the observed radial density profile ( rdp ) of the clusters was parametrized following the approach by kaluzny & udalski ( 1992 ) where the projected radial density @xmath71 is described as :    @xmath72 ,    where the core radius @xmath73 is the radial distance at which the value of @xmath74 becomes half of the central density @xmath75 .",
    "the best fit obtained by @xmath76 minimization technique , is shown in fig .",
    "3 . within the uncertainties the model reproduces well the radial density profile of the cluster .",
    "the core radius @xmath77 increases from @xmath78 for @xmath79 mag to @xmath80 for @xmath81 mag , whereas for the 2mass data @xmath73 comes out to be @xmath82",
    ". a closer look of the rdps indicates a lack of stars in optical data in the @xmath83 whereas there seems an increase in the stellar density obtained from the 2mass data in this radial distance range .",
    "this enhancement may be due to embedded population of low mass stars .",

    "4 the zero - age - main - sequence ( zams ) from schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) is shifted along a normal reddening vector having a slope of @xmath85 .",

    "the tcd shows a variable reddening in the cluster region between @xmath87 mag and @xmath88 mag .",
    "the reddening for the individual stars ( those with photometric @xmath89 mag ) with spectral type earlier than a0 has also been derived using the q method ( johnson & morgan 1953 ) . the radial variation of reddening in the cluster region is shown in fig .",

    "the reddening does not show any significant spatial variation in the cluster region barring a peak at @xmath90 .",
    "it may interesting to point out that around the maxima of @xmath86 at @xmath90 , the optical rdp show decrease in stellar density .",
    "the decrease in stellar density becomes more prominent if we include fainter stars in the sample .",
    "whereas , at @xmath91 , the rdp from 2mass data shows enhancement in the stellar density .    to study the nature of the extinction law in the cluster region , we used tcds as described by pandey et al .",

    "the tcds of the form of ( @xmath92 ) vs. ( @xmath93 ) , where @xmath14 is one of the wavelengths of the broadband filters @xmath94 and @xmath95 provide an effective method for separating the influence of the normal extinction produced by the diffuse interstellar medium from that of the abnormal extinction arising within regions having a peculiar distribution of dust sizes ( cf . chini & wargau 1990 , pandey et al .",

    "in particular the contribution of the uibs emission has been removed in generating the optical depth in the modeling of the mir emission from the msx bands , however the iras - hires maps represent the emission from dust and uib carriers ( e.g. the emission from the uib features falls within the iras 12 @xmath59 m band ( @xmath1 8 - 15 @xmath59 m ) ) .",
    "the overestimate of thermal emission from the grains at 12 @xmath59 m band due to uib features would imply a higher effective colour temperature t(12/25 ) for the grains .",
    "this would then affect the inferred optical depth ( by reduction in its value ) .",
