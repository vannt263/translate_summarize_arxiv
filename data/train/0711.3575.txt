    "we start by presenting the standard bssn formulation , where we follow the notations of  @xcite , which are widely used among numerical relativists .",
    "the idea of the bssn formulation is to introduce auxiliary variables to those of the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) formulation for obtaining longer stable numerical simulations .",
    "the basic variables of the bssn formulation are @xmath2 , which are defined by @xmath3,\\label{eq : ext - trldess}\\\\ \\tilde{\\gamma}^i & = & \\tilde{\\gamma}^{jk}{\\tilde{\\gamma}^i}_{jk } , \\label{eq : conf - con}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 are the intrinsic and extrinsic adm 3-metric .",

    "the two  kinematic \" constraints , the hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations , are expressed in terms of the bssn basic variables and are written as    @xmath16    additionally , the bssn formulation requires three  algebraic \" constraint relations ; @xmath17 where ( [ eq : cons - calg ] ) and ( [ eq : cons - cala ] ) are from the definitions of ( [ eq : conf - con ] ) and ( [ eq : ext - trldess ] ) , respectively . equation  ( [ eq : cons - cals ] ) is from the requirement on @xmath18 .    these five constraints are , theoretically , supposed to be zero at all times ; therefore they can be used to modify the dynamical equations .",
    "for example , alcubierre et al .",
    "@xcite announced that the replacement of the terms in ( [ eq : ev - conf - con ] ) using the momentum constraint drastically changes the stability feature .",
    "actually , such replacements of terms using constraints are applied ( with / without intentions ) in many terms in ( [ eq : ev - conf])-([eq : ev - conf - con ] ) , which are expressed as eqs .",

    "this technique again can be understood as the trace - out of the @xmath20-constraint ( [ eq : cons - cala ] ) from the evolution equations . in our numerical code",
    ", we do not apply this technique because we recognize the trace - free property as the new constraint @xmath20 in the bssn system , and our purpose is to construct a system preventing the violation of constraints .",
    "recently , several groups applied artificial dissipation ( e.g.  @xcite ) to obtain stable evolutions ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we , however , do not introduce such dissipations in our code , since we try to clarify the difference of stability from the viewpoint of _ formulations _ of the einstein equations .      to understand the stability property of the bssn system , yoneda and shinkai  @xcite studied the structure of the evolution equations , ( [ eq : ev - conf])-([eq : ev - conf - con ] ) , in detail , especially how the modifications using the constraints , ( [ eq : cal h])-([eq : cons - cals ] ) , affect to the stability .",
    "they investigated the signature of the eigenvalues of the constraint propagation equations ( dynamical equations of constraints ) , and explained that the standard bssn dynamical equations are balanced from the viewpoints of constrained propagations , including a clarification of the effect of the replacement using the momentum constraint equation .",
    "moreover , they predicted that several combinations of modifications have a constraint - damping nature , and named them _ adjusted _ bssn systems .",
    "( their predictions are based on the signature of eigenvalues of the constraint propagations , and the negative signature implies a dynamical system which evolves toward the constraint surface as the attractor . )    among them , in this work , we test the following three adjustments :    1 .",
    "an adjustment of the @xmath21-equation with the momentum constraint : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is predicted ( from the eigenvalue analysis ) to be positive in order to damp the constraint violations .",

    "an adjustment of the @xmath27-equation with @xmath24 constraint : @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "these three adjustments are chosen as samples of  best candidates \" , eq .",
    "( 4.9)-(4.11 ) in  @xcite .",
    "best \" comes from their conjecture on the eigenvalue analysis of the constraint propagation matrix ; that is , ( a ) all the resultant eigenvalues from above adjustments can be less than or at most equal to zero , which indicates the decay of constraint errors , and ( b ) the resultant constraint propagation matrix is diagonalizable , which guarantees the predictions of above eigenvalue analysis ( see table ii in  @xcite ) .",
    "however , since above eigenvalues include zero elements and also above analysis assumes a linearly perturbed metric about the flat space - time , the effects of the adjustments ( [ b1-adj])-([b2b - adj ] ) need to be demonstrated via numerical experiments .",
    "following the proposals of the mexico numerical relativity workshop   @xcite , we perform three kinds of tests . in this section",

    "the initial 3-metric and extrinsic curvature @xmath48 are given by a diagonal perturbation with component @xmath49 where @xmath50 for a linearized plane wave traveling in the @xmath33-direction .",
    "here @xmath51 is the linear size of the propagation domain and @xmath32 is the amplitude of the wave",
    ". the non - trivial components of extrinsic curvature are then @xmath52 following @xcite , we chose the following parameters :    * linear wave parameters : @xmath35 and @xmath53 * simulation domain : @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath54 , @xmath55 * grid : @xmath39 with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 with @xmath42 * time step : @xmath43 * boundary conditions : periodic boundary condition in @xmath33 direction and planar symmetry in @xmath44 and @xmath45 directions * gauge conditions : @xmath56 and @xmath57    the 1d simulation is carried out for a @xmath47 crossing - time or until the code crashes .      the third test is to check the formulation in a strong field context using the polarized gowdy metric , which is written as @xmath58 here time coordinate @xmath59 is chosen such that time increases as the universe expands .",

    "we can set the lapse function in the new time coordinate to be unity at the initial time .",
    "concretely , we set @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the initial time . following  @xcite",
    ", we perform our evolution in the collapsing ( i.e. backward in time ) direction .",

    "we have developed a new numerical code based on the adjusted bssn systems .",

    "the time - integration is under the free - evolution scheme , and we monitor five constraints , ( [ eq : cal h])-([eq : cons - cals ] ) , to check the accuracy and stability of the evolutions .    our time - integration scheme is the three - step iterative crank - nicholson method with centered finite difference in space  @xcite .",
    "this scheme should have second - order convergence both in space and time , and we checked its convergence in all the testbeds .",
    "as we have already mentioned in the end of  ii a , we do not apply the trace - out technique of @xmath7 , ( [ redef_traceout ] ) in our code .",
    "we also remark on our treatment of the conformal connection variable @xmath8 . as was pointed out in  @xcite , it is better not to use @xmath8 in all the evolution equations .",
    "we surmise this is because the amplification of the error due to the discrepancy of the definition ( [ eq : conf - con ] ) , i.e. , the accumulations of the violations of @xmath78-constraint ( [ eq : cons - calg ] ) .",
    "therefore , we used the evolved @xmath8 only for the terms in ( [ eq : ev - conf - con ] ) and ( [ eq : conm - ricci ] ) , and not for other terms , so as not to implicitly apply the @xmath78-constraint in time evolutions .",
    "it is crucial that our code can produce accurate results , because the adjustment methods are based on the assumption that the code represents the bssn system  ( [ eq : ev - conf])-([eq : ev - conf - con ] ) accurately .",
    "we verified our code by comparing our numerical data with analytic solutions from the gauge - wave and gowdy - wave testbeds in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] .",
    "the actual procedures are as follows :    1 .   evolve only one component , e.g. @xmath79 , numerically , and express all the other components with those of the analytic solution .",
    "in this situation , the origin of the error is from the finite differencing of the analytic solution in the spatial direction and from that of the numerically evolved component ( @xmath79 ) both in spatial and time directions .",
    "we checked the code by monitoring the difference between the numerically evolved component ( @xmath79 ) and its analytic expression .",
    "this procedure was applied to all the components one by one .",
    "2 .   evolve only several components , e.g. , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , numerically , and express the other components by the analytic solution .",
    "the error can be checked by a procedure similar to the one above .",
    "3 .   evolve all the components numerically , and check the error with the analytic solution .",
    "we repeated these procedure three times by switching the propagation directions ( @xmath33 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45-directions ) of gauge - wave and gowdy - wave solutions .",
    "we also applied these procedures in a 2d test  @xcite , and checked the off - diagonal component .",
    "it should be emphasized that the adjustment effect has two meanings , improvement of stability and of accuracy . even if a simulation is stable",
    ", it does not imply that the result is accurate .",
    "we judge the stability of the evolution by monitoring the l2 norm of each constraint , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the total number of grid points , while we judge the accuracy by the difference of the metric components @xmath83 from the exact solution @xmath84 , @xmath85      adjusted systems ,  ( [ b1-adj])-([b2b - adj ] ) , require to specify the parameter @xmath86 . from the analytical prediction in  @xcite we know the signature of @xmath86 , but not for its magnitude . by definition of the adjustment terms in eq .",
    "( [ b1-adj])-([b2b - adj ] ) , applying small @xmath86 should produce the close results with those of the plain system . on the contrary",
    ", the large @xmath86 system will violate the courant - friedrich - lewy condition  @xcite .",
    "hence , there exists a suitable region in the adjustment parameters .    at this moment",
    ", we have to chose @xmath86 experimentally , by observing the life - time of simulations .",
    "the value of @xmath86 , used in our demonstrations , is one of the choices of which the adjustment works effectively in all the resolutions .",
    "as the first test , we show the plain bssn evolution ( that is , no adjustments ) in fig .",

    "[ 1d - gauge - plain ] , the l2 norms of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints ( [ eq : errorc ] ) are plotted as a function of the crossing - time .",
    "the second - order convergent nature is lost at an early time , the 20 crossing - time , and the simulation crashes at about the 100 crossing - time .",
    "the poor performance of the plain bssn system for the gauge wave test has been reported in  @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "this drawback , on the other hand , can be overcome if one uses the fourth - order finite differencing scheme , an example of which can be seen in  @xcite ( see their fig .  2 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in order to check the _ accuracy _ of the simulations , we prepare fig .

    "damps with time .",
    "therefore we use the criterion that the error normalized by @xmath87 be under @xmath88 for an _ accurate evolution_. this criterion is the same as the one used in zlochower et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure  [ 1d - gowdy - gzz ] shows the normalized error in @xmath87 versus time for the plain bssn , adjusted bssn with @xmath89-equation , and adjusted bssn with @xmath18-equation systems .",
    "we find that these three systems produce accurate results up to @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "this proves that the adjustments work effectively , i.e , they make possible a stable and accurate simulation , especially the @xmath20-adjusted bssn system .",
    "in this article , we presented our numerical comparisons of the bssn formulation and its adjusted versions using constraints .",
    "we performed three testbeds : gauge - wave , linear wave , and collapsing polarized gowdy - wave tests with their evolutions by three kinds of adjustments , which were previously proposed by yoneda and shinkai  @xcite based on their constraint propagation analysis .",
    "the idea of the adjusted systems is to construct a system robust against constraint violations by modifying the evolution equations using the constraint equations .",
    "we can summarize our tests as follows :    * when the plain ( original ) bssn evolutions already show satisfactory good evolutions ( e.g. , the linear wave test ) , the constraint violations ( i.e. , adjusted terms ) are also small or ignorable .    therefore the adjusted bssn equations become quite similar to the plain bssn equations , and their results coincide with the plain bssn results .    * among the adjustments we tried , we observed that the adjusted bssn system with the @xmath21-eq .",
    "( [ b1-adj ] ) is the most robust for all the testbeds examined in this study .",
    "it gives us an accurate and stable evolution compared to the plain bssn system .",
    "quantitatively , the life - time of the simulation becomes 10 times longer for the gauge - wave testbed and 5 times longer for the gowdy - wave testbed than the life - time of the plain bssn system .",
    "however , it should be noted that for the gauge - wave testbed , the convergence feature is lost at a comparatively early time , the 200 crossing - time in the hamiltonian constraint and the 50 crossing - time in the momentum constraint .",
    "recently , it has been claimed that the set up of the gauge wave problem in apples - with - apples has a problematic point  @xcite , which arises from the harmonic gauge condition . in @xcite , it is argued that this gauge has a residual freedom in the form @xmath93 , where @xmath61 is an arbitrary and @xmath94 is a function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gwave - metric ] ) . of course",
    ", our set up corresponds to the @xmath95 case , but numerical error easily excites modes that result in either exponentially increasing or decaying metric amplitude .",
    "actually , we find the amplitude of the error decays with time in this testbed .",
    "so , we conclude that due to the adjustment , the growing rate of the gauge mode is suppressed and the life - time of the simulation is extended as a result .",
    "* the other type of adjustments ( [ b2a - adj ] and [ b2b - adj ] ) show their apparent effects while depending on a problem .",
    "the @xmath27-adjustment for the gauge - wave testbed makes the life - time longer slightly .",
    "the @xmath18-adjustment for the gowdy - wave testbed makes possible a simulation twice as long as the plain bssn system .",
    "we can understand the effect of the adjustments in terms of adding dissipative terms . by virtue of the definition of the constraints",
    ", we can recognize that the adjusted equation corresponds to the diffusion equation ( see , for example , eq .",
    "( [ b1-adj ] ) ) and the signature of @xmath86 determines whether the diffusion is positive or negative . in the adjusted @xmath21-eq .",
    "system , ( [ b1-adj ] ) , the adjustment term corresponds to the positive diffusive term , due to the definition of @xmath96 and the positiveness of @xmath97 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : cal mi ] ) and ( [ b1-adj ] ) ) .",
    "this fact might explain why the adjusted @xmath21-eq . system works effectively for all the testbeds .",
    "in contrast , why are not all the adjustments effective in all testbeds ? as we mentioned in sec .",
    "iib , the eigenvalue analysis was made on the linearly perturbed violation of constraints on the minkowski space - time .",
    "since the constraint violation grows non - linearly as seen in the appendix of @xcite , the candidates may not be the best in their later evolution phase .",
    "we remark upon two more interesting aspects arising from our study .",
    "the first is the mechanism of the constraint violations . as was shown in the appendix of  @xcite , each constraint propagation ( behavior of their growth or decrease ) depends on the other constraint terms together with itself .",
    "that is , we can guess @xmath20 and @xmath98 constraints ( [ eq : cons - cala ] and [ eq : cons - cals ] ) in this article , propagate independently of the other constraints , while the violation of the @xmath24-constraint , ( [ eq : cons - calg ] ) is triggered by the violation of the momentum constraint , and both the hamiltonian and the momentum constraints are affected by all the other constraints .",
    "such an order of the constraint violation can be guessed in fig .",
    "[ fig : c - vio - gauge ] ( earlier time ) , where we plot the rate of constraint violation normalized with its initial value , @xmath99 , as a function of time , for the gauge - wave testbeds with the plain bssn evolution .",
    "( note that the constraints at the initial time , @xmath100 , are not zero due to the numerical truncation error . )",
    "the parameters are the same as those shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugewave ] , and the lowest resolution run is used . from this investigation",
    ", we might conclude that to monitor the momentum constraint violation is the key to checking the stability of the evolution .",
    "the second remark is on the lagrange multipliers , @xmath86 , used in the adjusted systems . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : adjbssn ] , the signatures of the @xmath86s are determined _ a priori _ , and we confirmed that all the predicted signatures of @xmath86s in  @xcite are right to produce positive effects for controlling constraint violations .",
    "however , we have to search for a suitable magnitude of @xmath86s for each problem .",
    "therefore we are now trying to develop a more sophisticated version , such as an auto - controlling @xmath86 system , which will be reported upon in the future elsewhere .",
    "although the testbeds used in this work are simple , it might be rather surprising to observe the expected effects of adjustments with such a slight change in the evolution equations .",
    "we therefore think that our demonstrations imply a potential to construct a robust system against constraint violations even in highly dynamical situations , such as black hole formation via gravitational collapse , or binary merger problems .",
    "we are now preparing our strong - field tests of the adjusted bssn systems using large amplitude gravitational waves , black hole space - time , or non - vacuum space - time , which will be reported on in the near future .",

    "<S> we present our numerical comparisons between the bssn formulation widely used in numerical relativity today and its adjusted versions using constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we performed three testbeds : gauge - wave , linear wave , and gowdy - wave tests , proposed by the mexico workshop on the formulation problem of the einstein equations . </S>",
    "<S> we tried three kinds of adjustments , which were previously proposed from the analysis of the constraint propagation equations , and investigated how they improve the accuracy and stability of evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that the signature of the proposed lagrange multipliers are always right and the adjustments improve the convergence and stability of the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> when the original bssn system already shows satisfactory good evolutions ( e.g. , linear wave test ) , the adjusted versions also coincide with those evolutions ; while in some cases ( e.g. , gauge - wave or gowdy - wave tests ) the simulations using the adjusted systems last 10 times as long as those using the original bssn equations . </S>",
    "<S> our demonstrations imply a potential to construct a robust evolution system against constraint violations even in highly dynamical situations . </S>"
