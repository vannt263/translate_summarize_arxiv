    "thanks to recent advances in technology , an era of gravitational wave astronomy has almost arrived .",
    "there are already several large - scale laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors that are in operation in the world . among them",
    "are tama300 @xcite , ligo @xcite , geo-600 @xcite , and virgo @xcite is expected to start its operation soon .",
    "the primary targets of these ground - based detectors are inspiralling compact binaries , which are expected to be detected in the near future .",
    "there are also space - based interferometric detector projects .",
    "lisa is now on its r & d stage  @xcite , and there is a future plan called decigo / bbo  @xcite .",
    "these space - based detectors can detect gravitational waves from solar - mass compact objects orbiting supermassive black holes . to extract out physical information of such binary systems , it is essential to know the theoretical gravitational waveforms with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the black hole perturbation approach is most suited for this purpose . in this approach ,",
    "one considers gravitational waves emitted by a point particle that represents a compact object orbiting a black hole , assuming the mass of the particle ( @xmath0 ) is much less than that of the black hole ( @xmath1 ) ; @xmath2 .    in the lowest order in the mass ratio @xmath3 , the orbit of the particle is a geodesic on the background geometry of a black hole . already in this lowest order , by combining with the assumption of adiabatic orbital evolution ,",
    "this approach has been proved to be very powerful for evaluating general relativistic corrections to the gravitational waveforms , even for neutron star - neutron star ( ns - ns ) binaries where the assumption of this approach is maximally violated  @xcite .    in the next order ,",
    "the orbit deviates from the geodesic because the spacetime is perturbed by the particle .",
    "we can interpret this deviation as the effect of the self - force of the particle on itself .",
    "since it is essential to take account of this deviation to predict the orbital evolution accurately , we have to derive the equation of motion that includes the self - force .",
    "the gravitational self - force is , however , not easily obtainable .",
    "there are two main obstacles .",
    "first , the full ( bare ) metric perturbation diverges at the location of the particle , which is point - like , hence so does the self - force .",
    "the full metric perturbation can be formally divided into two parts ; the direct part that comes from the perturbation propagating along the light cone of the background spacetime directly from the source particle , and the tail part that arises from the curvature scattering of the perturbation , which exists within the light cone .",
    "the self - force is given by the tail part of the metric perturbation which is regular at the location of the particle  @xcite .",
    "recently , this is reformulated in a more elaborated way by detweiler and whiting  @xcite . in this new formulation ,",
    "the direct part is replaced by the s part and the tail part is replaced by the r part .",
    "the r part is equivalent to the tail part as far as the self - force calculation is concerned , but which has a much better property that it is a solution of source - free linearized einstein equations .",
    "thus , one has to identify the r part of the metric perturbation to obtain a meaningful self - force .",
    "however , by construction , the r part can not be determined locally but depends on the whole history of the particle .",
    "therefore , one usually identifies the direct part ( or the s part ) which can be evaluated locally in the vicinity of the particle to a necessary order , i.e. , by local analysis , and subtract it from the full metric perturbation .",
    "this identification of the s part is _ the subtraction problem_.    second , the regularized self - force is formally defined only in the harmonic ( lorentz ) gauge , in which linearized einstein equations are hyperbolic , which enables us to define the s part and the r part uniquely . on the other hand , the metric perturbation of a black hole geometry can be calculated only in the radiation gauge in the kerr background  @xcite , or in the regge - wheeler(-zerilli ) gauge in the schwarzschild background  @xcite .",
    "hence , one has to find a gauge transformation to express the full metric perturbation and the s part in a same gauge , to identify the r part in that gauge correctly .",
    "this is _ the gauge problem_.    as a method to solve the subtraction problem , extending earlier work  @xcite , mino , nakano and sasaki formulated two types of regularization methods , namely , the ` power expansion regularization ' and the ` mode - decomposition regularization '  @xcite . in particular , the mode - decomposition regularization was found to be quite powerful .",
    "meanwhile , barack and ori independently developed the ` mode - sum regularization '  @xcite .",
    "although the mode - decomposition regularization and the mode - sum regularization were quite different in their formulations , they are essentially the same in the sense that the spherical harmonic expansion is used to regularize the divergent metric .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the two methods give the same result for the s part in the harmonic gauge , in the form of a ( divergent ) spherical harmonic series , for an arbitrary orbit in the schwarzschild background  @xcite .",
    "however , it seems extremely difficult to solve the metric perturbation under the harmonic gauge because the metric components couple to each other in a complicated way  @xcite .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the gauge problem is difficult to solve .",
    "recently , barack and ori  @xcite gave a useful insight into the gauge problem .",
    "they proposed an intermediate gauge approach in which only the direct part of the metric in the harmonic gauge is subtracted from the full metric perturbation in the regge - wheeler ( rw ) gauge .",
    "they then argued that the gauge - dependence of the self - force is unimportant when averaged over a sufficiently long lapse of time . using this approach ,",
    "the gravitational self - force for an orbit plunging into a schwarzschild black hole was calculated by barack and lousto  @xcite .",
    "in the case of the kerr background , which is of our ultimate interest , there is additionally a much more intricate technical issue of how to treat the spheroidal harmonics : neither the eigenfunction nor the eigenvalue has simple analytical expressions , and they are entangled with the frequency eigenvalues of fourier modes .",
    "further , the only known gauge in which the metric perturbation can be evaluated is the radiation gauge formulated by chrzanowski  @xcite .",
    "however , the chrzanowski construction of the metric perturbation becomes ill - defined in the neighborhood of the particle , i.e. , the einstein equations are not satisfied there  @xcite .",
    "some progress was made by ori  @xcite to obtain the correct , full metric perturbation in the kerr background .",
    "the regularization parameters in the mode - sum regularization for the kerr case are calculated by barack and ori  @xcite .",
    "although our ultimate goal is to overcome these difficulties altogether , since each one is sufficiently involved , we choose to proceed step by step , and focus on the schwarzschild background .    in this paper , in order to obtain the gravitational self - force , we consider a particle orbiting a schwarzschild black hole , and propose a method to calculate the regularized self - force by solving the subtraction and gauge problems simultaneously .",
    "namely , we develop a method to regularize the self - force in the regge - wheeler gauge .",
    "the regularization is done by the mode - decomposition regularization , and we introduce the concept of a `` finite gauge transformation '' of the s part  @xcite . it is noted that , although our approach is philosophically quite different from the intermediate gauge approach by barack and or  @xcite , practically both approaches turn out to give the same result as far as the calculation of the gauge transformation is concerned .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : mdr ] , we review the mode - decomposition regularization .",
    "we first derive the direct part of the self - force ( which is equivalent to the s part in the coincidence limit of a field point with a point on the particle trajectory ) by local analysis .",
    "then we transform it to an infinite series of spherical harmonic modes and derive the regularization counter terms for a general orbit . in section  [ sec : gauge ] , further focusing on a circular orbit , we perform a gauge transformation from the harmonic gauge to the rw gauge , and present the first post - newtonian order self - force .",
    "one of the reasons why we had to focus on circular orbits is that it is formidable to obtain a closed analytic expression of the full metric perturbation for a general orbit even under the post - newtonian expansion . in section  [ seq : newreg ] , turning back to a simpler case of the self - force of a scalar - charged particle , we present a new regularization method that can apply to an arbitrary orbit .",
    "this new method is a variation ( or an improved version ) of the mode - decomposition regularization .",
    "the essential point is to divide the full field in the frequency domain into two parts , the @xmath4 part and @xmath5 part , in such a way that the divergent part is totally contained in the @xmath4 part whose frequency integral can be analytically performed .",
    "in this section , we review the mode - decomposition regularization method , and derive the regularization counter terms for an general orbit in the schwarzschild background . for simplicity , we consider a scalar - charged particle which sources a scalar field @xmath6 .",
    "the extension to the gravitational case is straightforward .",
    "the only complication is the presence of additional tensor indices associated with the metric perturbation .",
    "since the tail part depends non - locally on the geometry of a background spacetime , it is almost impossible to calculate it directly .",
    "however , for a certain class of spacetimes such as schwarzschild / kerr geometries , there is a way to calculate the full field generated by a point source . considering a field point slightly off the particle trajectory ,",
    "it is then possible to obtain the tail part by subtracting the locally given divergent direct part from the full field .",
    "let @xmath7 be a trajectory of the particle with @xmath8 beging the proper time along the trajectory .",
    "then the field @xmath9 generated by the particle is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the retarded green function satisfying the klein - gordon equation , @xmath12 the self - force at @xmath13 is schematically given by @xmath14(x ) \\",

    "we use the boyer - lindquist coordinates for the schwarzschild background , @xmath25 and denote a field point by @xmath26 and a point on the orbit by @xmath27 .      even in the newtonian limit",
    ", the integration of an orbit involves an elliptic function .",
    "thus , numerical computations will be necessary at some stage of deriving the self - force .",
    "however , it will not be easy to perform the regularization of the divergence numerically . the idea to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to replace the divergence by an infinite series , each term of which is finite and analytically calculable .",
    "the derivation of the direct part @xmath28 is one of the main issues in the regularization calculation .",
    "the direct part of the scalar field is obtained by integrating the direct part of the retarded green function with the scalar charge .",
    "the direct part of the retarded green function @xmath29 is given in a covariant manner as  @xcite @xmath30 \\sqrt{\\delta(x , x')}\\delta\\bigl(\\sigma(x , x')\\bigr ) \\",

    "the physical meaning of the direct part is understood by the factor @xmath35\\delta\\bigl(\\sigma(x , x')\\bigr)$ ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : direct - g ] ) .",
    "since @xmath31 describes the geodesic distance between @xmath34 and @xmath37 , the direct part of the green function becomes non - zero only when @xmath37 lies on the past lightcone of @xmath34 .",
    "hence the direct part describes the effect of the waves propagated directly from @xmath37 to @xmath34 without scattered by the background curvature .    for the actual evaluation of the direct part",

    "the order of the local expansion is represented by the powers of @xmath51 , where @xmath51 is the coordinate difference between the field point @xmath34 and the orbital point @xmath52 ; @xmath53 . because the full force is quadratically divergent",
    ", we must carry out the local bi - tensor expansion of the full field up through @xmath54 . by evaluating the local coordinate values of the relevant bi - tensors , we obtain the local expansion of the full force in a given coordinate system . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , this may be done in a systematic manner , and it is possible to obtain the explicit form of the divergence for a general orbit .",
    "however , the problem is how to decompose it into an appropriate infinite series .",
    "the mode - decomposition regularization method is based on the spherical harmonic series expansion  @xcite .",
    "there is a delicate problem in this approach .",
    "the exact decomposition calculation usually needs the global analytic structure of the field so that we can uniquely define each term in the infinite series . on the other hand ,",
    "the divergent direct part to be subtracted is given only by local analysis of the field  @xcite .",
    "thus the direct part is defined ( and known ) only in a local neighborhood of the particle . because of this , to obtain a harmonic series expression of the direct part , we need a global extension of the direct part . but this extension can not be done uniquely in practice .",
    "nevertheless , the final result of the self - force should be unique .",
    "although we have no explicit proof for the uniqueness of the regularization counter terms for the self - force , the uniqueness is intuitively apparent because the extension is performed in such a way that the local behavior is retained with sufficiently accuracy .",
    "in addition , it is reassuring to find that the resulting counter terms , presented at the end of this section , agree completely with those obtained in the mode - sum regularization by barack and ori  @xcite .",
    "the harmonic decomposition is defined on a two - sphere .",
    "however both the direct field and the full field have divergence on the sphere containing the particle location , the mode decomposition is ill - defined on that sphere .",
    "therefore , we perform the harmonic decomposition of the direct and full fields on a sphere which does not include , but sufficiently close to the orbit .",
    "the steps in the mode - decomposition regularization are as follows .",
    "we evaluate both the full field and the direct field at @xmath55 where we do not take the coincidence limit of either @xmath56 or @xmath57    we decompose the full force and direct force into infinite harmonic series as @xmath58(x ) & = & \\sum_{\\ell m}f_\\alpha^{\\ell m}[{\\varphi}^{\\rm full}](x ) \\ , , \\\\",
