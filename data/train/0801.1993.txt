    "self - affine tilings arise in many different contexts , notably in dynamics ( markov partitions for hyperbolic maps @xcite ) , logic ( aperiodic tilings @xcite ) , number theory ( radix representations @xcite ) , physics ( quasicrystals @xcite ) , ergodic theory @xcite , and hyperbolic groups @xcite . see @xcite for recent surveys with a large bibliography .    a * self - affine tiling * ( sat ) @xmath6 of @xmath0 is a covering of @xmath0 with sets ( tiles ) @xmath7 satisfying the following properties :    1 .",
    "each tile @xmath7 is the closure of its interior .",
    "interiors of tiles do not overlap .",
    "3 .   there are a finite number of tile types up to translation .",
    "the tiling is * repetitive * and has * finitely many local configurations * ( see the next section for definitions ) .",
    "there is an expanding linear map @xmath8 mapping tiles over tiles : the image of a tile @xmath7 is a union of tiles of @xmath9 , and two tiles of the same type have images which are translation - equivalent patches of tiles .",
    "the simplest example is the periodic tiling with unit cubes and expansion mapping @xmath10",
    ". however typically sats are nonperiodic and have tiles with fractal boundaries .",
    "see figures [ sat1 ] and [ sat2 ] for examples in @xmath11 .",
    "lind @xcite ( using different language ) gives a characterization of expansion factors of self - affine tilings in one dimension : @xmath12 is the expansion of an sat of @xmath13 if and only if @xmath14 is a * perron number * , that is , a real algebraic integer which is strictly larger in modulus than all of its galois conjugates .",
    "a self - affine tiling is * self - similar * if @xmath1 is a similarity ( a homothety followed by a rotation ) .",
    "thurston @xcite showed that the expansion factor @xmath15 of a self - similar tiling of @xmath11 is a * complex perron number * , that is , an algebraic integer which is strictly larger in modulus than its galois conjugates except for its complex conjugate . in @xcite ,",
    "a construction of a self - similar tiling for every complex perron number is given ; unfortunately , the proof as written in subsection 4.5 of @xcite is incomplete .",
    "a version of the construction does yield a tiling with expansion @xmath16 for @xmath17 sufficiently large , and we hope that it can be modified to get a tiling with expansion @xmath2 , completing the characterization .",
    "this gap does not affect the construction in section 6 of @xcite which uses free group endomorphisms ; however , the latter does not cover all the complex perron numbers .",
    "see also @xcite for a related construction .    in the current paper",
    "we study sats of @xmath0 with expansion matrix @xmath1 which is diagonalizable over @xmath5 .",
    "we show that if @xmath1 is the expansion matrix for an sat then eigenvalues of @xmath1 are algebraic integers , and for every eigenvalue @xmath18 , all galois conjugates of @xmath18 which have modulus @xmath19 have multiplicity ( among eigenvalues of @xmath1 ) at least as large as that of @xmath18 , see theorem [ th - main ] below .",
    "an alternative description of this criterion is that there is an integer matrix @xmath20 acting on @xmath21 for some @xmath22 , which has an invariant real subspace @xmath23 of dimension @xmath4 , on which it has strictly larger growth ( that is , strictly larger determinant , in absolute value ) than for any other @xmath4-dimensional invariant subspace , and @xmath20 restricted to @xmath23 is linearly conjugate to @xmath1 .",
    "the converse to our result is open : does there exist , for every linear map @xmath1 satisfying the above conditions , an sat with expansion @xmath1 ? we conjecture that the answer is yes .    in figure 2",
    "we show an example of a self - affine ( non - self - similar ) sat in the plane . the subdivision rule is indicated in figure 3 .",
    "our methods do not at present extend to the non - diagonalizable case .",
    "however , we conjecture that the second description above holds in general , that is , without the constraint of diagonalizability , @xmath1 is the expansion of an sat if and only if there is an integer matrix @xmath20 acting on @xmath21 for some @xmath22 , which has an invariant real subspace @xmath23 of dimension @xmath4 , on which it has strictly larger growth ( determinant ) than for any other @xmath4-dimensional invariant subspace , and @xmath20 restricted to @xmath23 is linearly conjugate to @xmath1 .",
    "for example , we conjecture that there is no sat in @xmath24 with expansion @xmath25 although it is easy to construct one with expansion @xmath26",
    "we say that a tiling @xmath27 has a finite number of tile types up to translation , if there is an equivalence relation @xmath28 on the tiles @xmath7 with a finite number of equivalence classes and @xmath29 implies that @xmath30 is a translate of @xmath7 .",
    "we denote @xmath31 $ ] the equivalence class of tile @xmath7 , and say @xmath7 is a tile of * type * @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "a * patch * in a tiling is a finite set of its tiles .",
    "two patches are said to be * equivalent * if one is a translate of the other , that is , there is a single translation which takes every tile in one patch to an equivalent tile in the other patch .",
    "the * radius of a patch * is the radius of the smallest ball containing the patch .",
    "a tiling is said to have a * finite number of local configurations * , or flc for short , if there are a finite number of equivalence classes of patches , up to translation , of any given radius .",
    "an flc tiling is * repetitive * if for all @xmath32 there is an @xmath33 such that every patch of radius @xmath34 can be found , up to translation , in any ball of radius @xmath35 in the tiling .",
    "this is equivalent to minimality of the orbit closure of the tiling , see e.g. @xcite , and was called quasiperiodicity in @xcite .    in an sat , the @xmath1-image of each tile type is a well - defined collection of translates of tile types . if @xmath7 is a tile we can write @xmath36 which is a finite interior - disjoint union .",
    "this subdivision only depends on the type of tile @xmath7 , in the sense that equivalent tiles have equivalent subdivisions .",
    "in particular we let @xmath37 be the number of tiles of type @xmath38 in the subdivision of a tile of type @xmath39 .",
    "the matrix @xmath40 is the * subdivision matrix * , it is a nonegative integer matrix which is * primitive * : some power is strictly positive ( by repetitivity of the tiling ) .",
    "the leading eigenvalue of @xmath41 is the volume expansion of the sat , which therefore must be a real perron number .",
    "given an sat , one can select in each of the tile types a point , called a * control point * , in such a way that the set @xmath42 of the control points of tiles in a tiling is forward invariant under @xmath1 : @xmath43 .",
    "this can be accomplished as follows @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop.1.3 ) ) : for each tile type @xmath31 $ ] , select one tile in its image under expansion and subdivision . let the preimage of this tile be @xmath44\\subset[t_i]$ ] .",
    "then the sequence @xmath31,a[t_i],a(a[t_i]),\\dots$ ] nests down to a single point in @xmath31 $ ] , denoted by @xmath45 , which we define to be the control point of @xmath7 . for a tile @xmath46",
    "we let @xmath47 .",
    "the following theorem is stated in @xcite .        *",
    "( ii ) * if @xmath2 is an eigenvalue of @xmath1 of multiplicity @xmath17 and @xmath49 is an algebraic conjugate of @xmath2 , then either @xmath50 , or @xmath49 is also an eigenvalue of @xmath1 of multiplicity greater than or equal to @xmath17 .    the proof is based on the arguments of thurston @xcite and kenyon @xcite , but we fill several gaps in those arguments and provide a great deal more detail . in particular , lemmas  [ lem - misha ] and [ lem - jensen ] have no analogs in @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that the corresponding parts of @xcite and @xcite have never appeared in refereed publications , but have been widely cited and used in the literature on tilings and tiling dynamical systems .    by appropriate choice of a basis",
    ", we can assume that the linear map @xmath1 has the real canonical form , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th.6.4.2 ) .",
    "since @xmath1 is diagonalizable over @xmath5 , this means that we have a direct sum decomposition @xmath51 into invariant subspaces associated with eigenvalues @xmath52 of @xmath1 , where we count eigenvalues , having non - negative imaginary part , with multiplicities . for a real eigenvalue @xmath52 ,",
    "the subspace @xmath53 is one - dimensional , and @xmath54 acts as multiplication by @xmath52 . for a non - real eigenvalue @xmath52 ,",
    "the subspace @xmath53 is two - dimensional . identifying it with a complex plane",

    "it is an easy exercise to pass to the limit as @xmath314 and conclude that @xmath110 is affine linear in the @xmath262-direction on @xmath315 . to be a bit more precise , we can verify that @xmath316 since @xmath110 is continuous , this implies that @xmath317 see e.g. , @xcite , where it is called the `` jensen functional equation '' .",
    "the details are straightforward .",

    "the set @xmath288 ( control points of type-1 tiles ) is relatively dense in @xmath0 ; let @xmath33 be such that every open ball of radius @xmath35 hits @xmath288 .",
    "let @xmath322 be such that @xmath323 for all @xmath147",
    ". then @xmath324 it follows that there exists a sequence of pairs @xmath325 , with @xmath326 , such that @xmath327 therefore , @xmath328 for @xmath17 sufficiently large , and hence @xmath329 for @xmath330 .",
    "now , @xmath331 hence @xmath332 .",
    "but @xmath333 , for @xmath330 , hence @xmath334 , since @xmath23 is closed , being a linear subspace of @xmath0 .",
    "now recall that @xmath262 is spanned by certain vectors of the form @xmath335 , with @xmath336 .",
    "since @xmath337 , we have that these vectors @xmath306 are in @xmath300 , and hence @xmath338 .",

    "_ as mentioned earlier , we would like to run the entire construction essentially restricting ourselves to the subspace @xmath300 , which is @xmath1-invariant , contains @xmath201 , and is spanned by the vectors of @xmath340 in it .",
    "we do not literally do this , because it is not clear what the intersection of the tiling with @xmath300 looks like ; rather , we make sure that the construction on @xmath0 is compatible with this subspace structure .",
    "recall that at the beginning of the proof we considered the free abelian group @xmath341 and its free generators @xmath64 .",
    "we will now use a more specific choice of the generators .",
    "namely , let @xmath342 clearly , @xmath343 is an abelian subgroup of @xmath61 , and @xmath344 by lemma  [ lem - ks3 ] .",
    "is it possible to choose the free generators for @xmath61 as an extension of a set of free generators for @xmath343 ?",
    "maybe not , but we can choose @xmath64 , the free generators of @xmath61 , so that @xmath345 are free generators of @xmath343 for some positive integers @xmath346 and @xmath347 ( see e.g. ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem ii.1.6 ) ) .",
    "recall that @xmath1 acts on @xmath61 , and on the generators @xmath73 this action is given by an integer matrix @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath1 also acts on @xmath343 , we claim that @xmath348 , where @xmath349 is an @xmath350 matrix .",
    "indeed , @xmath351 , @xmath352 , is a unique integral linear combination of @xmath353 , with the coefficients coming from the @xmath39-th column of @xmath20 . on",
    "the other hand , @xmath354 , @xmath355 , is an integral linear combination of @xmath356 , since the latter are free generators of @xmath343 .",
