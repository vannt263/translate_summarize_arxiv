    "resurgent analysis is a method of studying hyperasymptotic expansions @xmath0 and those of similar kind by treating such expansions as asymptotics obtained from a laplace integral @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a ramified analytic function in the complex domain with a discrete set of singularities and @xmath3 is an infinite path on the riemann surface of @xmath2 .",
    "the crucial observation is that the terms of ( [ hyperasexpn ] ) can be recovered from studying the singularities of @xmath2 , see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , as well as  @xcite for this author s preferred terminology .",
    "the methods of resurgent analysis have been used , in particular , to study asymptotics of solutions of linear ode with a small parameter , especially the schrdinger equation in the semiclassical approximation , see , e.g.  @xcite ; this technique is a refinement of what is known as the _ complex wkb method_. more specifically , consider an equation of the type @xmath4 where @xmath5 ranges over @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a small complex asymptotic parameter , and @xmath8 is an entire function often assumed to be a polynomial . under the transformation ( [ laplacetransf ] ) , this equation becomes an equation on an unknown ramified analytic function of two variable @xmath9 of the form @xmath10 the equation only needs to be satisfied modulo functions that are entire with respect to @xmath11 for every value of @xmath5 since such functions correspond to zero under a properly (  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pr i.2 ) ) understood laplace transform . since the beginnings of resurgent analysis in the early 1980s there has been no real doubt that ( [ mainequ ] ) possesses two linearly independent ( in an appropriate sense ) solutions that are endlessly analytically continuable with respect to @xmath11 and satisfy certain growth conditions at infinity .",
    "the manifold on which @xmath9 is defined is usually quite complicated . in the special cases when",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 , the function @xmath9 can be written down by an explicit formula and @xmath14 is expressible in terms of airy or weber function , see @xcite . for more complicated potentials ,",
    "say , when @xmath8 is a generic polynomial of degree @xmath15 , the function @xmath9 is expected to be defined on a highly transcendental manifold , see @xcite and @xcite : if for a fixed @xmath5 one projects _ all _ singularities on _ all _ sheets of the riemann surface of @xmath9 to the complex plane of @xmath11 , one expects to obtain an everywhere dense set .",
    "thus , there is no hope that the manifold in question is a universal cover of @xmath16 minus a discrete family of complex curves .",
    "singularities of @xmath2 and the precise structure of the manifold on which @xmath2 is defined are important because they allow us to obtain the hyperasymptotic expansion of @xmath14 for @xmath17 as follows ( cf .",

    "voros  @xcite studied the stokes phenomenon  appearance and disappearance of singularities from the first sheet of @xmath9 as @xmath5 varies , and described its consequences (  connection formulas \" ) for the hyperasymptotic expansions of @xmath14 .",
