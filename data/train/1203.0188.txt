    "this suggests studying the @xmath57 invariants of the singular locus of @xmath72 in its own right .",
    "in fact , we believe that the @xmath73 invariant of @xmath71 should vanish , in which case one could define its @xmath0 invariant , which we expect to be non - zero in general .",

    "this explains the vanishing of the @xmath0 invariant on the level of denominator reduction .",
    "given the expected relation between vanishing @xmath0 and transcendental weight drop of feynman amplitudes , theorem @xmath79 is evidence for a folklore conjecture which states that the highest weight part of the lowest logarithmic power of the renormalised amplitudes in @xmath11 theory is independent of the choice of renormalisation scheme .      in the light of conjecture @xmath52 , and the many observed but unexplained algebraic relations between residues of feynman graphs ,",

    "to these can be added some further relations for the denominator reduction described in @xcite ,  4.4 - 4.7 , which immediately imply identities for the @xmath0 invariant via @xmath80 .",
    "although an overarching combinatorial explanation for all these identities is still lacking , in @xmath81 we describe some new additive properties of denominator polynomials which give a single explanation for many of the identities of @xcite .",
    "finally , there remains the question of trying to relate @xmath78 to other classical invariants in the theory of graphs .",
    "a tantalizing but mysterious connection between knots and feynman integrals was investigated by broadhurst and kreimer in the 90 s @xcite , but has proven very hard to verify in concrete cases because of the difficulty in computation of feynman integrals , and the high loop orders of the diagrams involved .",
    "the @xmath0 invariant provides us with a tool to investigate such identities without having to compute any integrals .    in this paper",

    "it also explains the ad hoc identities from subsection 4.6 of @xcite if one also keeps track of the signs from the proof of the proposition .",
    "for example , using the notation of that paper , if we apply proposition [ split4 t ] to the middle left vertex of @xmath644 then we obtain ( with signs ) @xmath645 giving the polynomial @xmath646 . applying the proposition to the top left vertex of @xmath647",
    "we obtain two permutations of @xmath648 giving the polynomial @xmath649 .",
    "likewise , applying proposition [ split4 t ] twice to @xmath650 gives the three different permutations of @xmath648 and so correctly computes @xmath651 .",
    "consequently , these types of identities are no longer ad hoc , but come from splitting 4-valent vertices .",
    "one very important relation in mathematics @xcite , which is also found in quantum field theory @xcite , is the 4-term relation .",
    "the @xmath0 invariant does not satisfy this relation , but it is nonetheless a true identity of denominators .        beginning with @xmath26",
    "calculate @xmath655 since only edges @xmath335 , @xmath458 , and @xmath505 are adjacent to vertex @xmath656 , reducing by edge @xmath505 gives @xmath657 since only edges @xmath420 , @xmath505 , and @xmath658 are adjacent to vertex @xmath659 , reducing by edge @xmath658 gives @xmath660 since @xmath661 by the vanishing property  [ subsectdodg ] ( 4 ) as @xmath374 is 3-valent .",
    "furthermore , @xmath664 since both correspond up to a sign to @xmath665 thus , up to signs , @xmath666 arguing similarly for @xmath27 , @xmath667 , and @xmath668 we get @xmath669 all together @xmath670 which vanishes for appropriate sign choices by the plcker identity with @xmath671 (  [ subsectdodg ] ) .",
    "although there is no well - defined way to fix the signs in the denominator reduction for a single graph in general , we can determine signs for the @xmath672 s of the above graphs . for this",
    ", viewing the arguments to the 5 invariant as ordered , we can choose the sign given by the positive sign in the expression in definition [ def5inv ] , following that , fix the signs of later reductions where either the constant or quadratic term vanishes by choosing the sign of the constant term in the previous step .",
    "with these conventions and the order and orientations given in the illustrations , the above proof gives that @xmath673    this identity strongly suggests a connection to the 4-term relation for chord diagrams in knot theory @xcite .",
    "the other key identity in chord diagrams is the one - term relation . for denominators ,",
    "the one - term relation is the fact that graphs of the form @xmath674 are zero after integrating the five indicated edges . to see this ,",
    "write the 5-invariant of the five edges joining @xmath675 , @xmath676 , @xmath677 , and @xmath678 in spanning forest polynomials , @xmath679 this is zero since in both terms of the first factor there are parts which appear in both components of the graph and no edges remaining to join them .",
    "note that , unfortunately the four - term relation does not hold at the level of the @xmath0 invariant . as",
    "an example take @xmath680 from @xcite . from the illustration in that paper , label the vertices counterclockwise from 3 oclock starting with label @xmath629 .",

    "remove the new vertex .",
