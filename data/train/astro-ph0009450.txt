    "over the past four years , observations by the rossi xte satellite of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) have produced an abundance of data on the rapid variations of these sources x - ray brightness ( see van der klis 1998 , 2000 , for an overview , and references therein ) .",
    "most prominent in the sources high - resolution power spectra , the kilohertz - range quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) have been detected in @xmath2 binaries with compact accretors identified as neutron stars .",
    "the khz qpos often occur in pairs at frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ranging between @xmath6hz and @xmath7hz ) that can vary in a single source by up to a factor of @xmath8 ( over as little as few minutes ) in step with an inferred change in the accretion rate .",
    "in addition to the khz qpos , the horizontal - branch oscillations ( hbos ) of the high - luminosity ( near eddington ) neutron - star z sources and ` bumps ' in the power spectra of the lower - luminosity ( between @xmath9 and a few @xmath10 ) atoll sources ( for the definition and properties of the z and atoll sources see hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) have been observed at lower frequencies @xmath11hz .",
    "these frequencies also vary in apparently tight correlation with the khz qpo frequencies .",
    "the fact that the khz qpo frequencies lie in the range of orbital frequencies of bound geodesics near neutron - star - mass objects [ the kepler frequency for the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) around a static , spherical star of mass @xmath12 is @xmath13 motivated several theoretical scenarios ( see , e.g. , strohmayer _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 , stella & vietri 1999 ) for the x - ray luminosity modulation that all involve inertial or near - inertial motion of localised condensations  variously named ` clumps ' or ` blobs '  in the accretion flows around neutron stars . for instance , in a purely inertial ( geodesic ) orbital model , stella & vietri ( 1999 ; see also karas 1999 ) have proposed for a given source an identification of the variable qpo frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath3 with , respectively , the kepler frequencies @xmath14 and the periastron advance frequencies @xmath15 of a family of eccentric orbits .",
    "the preferred plane of accretion ( and , thus , of the clumps motion ) is normally assumed to lie close to the rotation equator of the central neutron star , a natural consequence of accretion - driven neutron star spin - up ( similar reasoning clearly favours _",
    "motion in the accretion flow ) .",
    "however , we need not exclude _ small _ deviations of the orbits from the equatorial plane , and so it has been speculated that a signal  e.g. , the qpos observed at frequency @xmath16  might be produced by the nodal precession of the orbital planes at frequency @xmath17 or its first overtone ( see , e.g. , stella & vietri 1998 and morsink & stella 1999 for the nodal precession of circular orbits ) .",
    "if any of the orbital models is confirmed , observation of orbital frequencies would provide a direct probe of the highly curved spacetimes around rapidly spinning neutron stars and an unprecedented test of the general theory of relativity in the strong - field regime .",
    "the highly accurate measurements of the khz qpo frequencies ( e.g. , the relative error @xmath18 for sco x-1 ; van der klis _",
    "1997 ) impose , however , stringent requirements on the qpo models ; they also make it necessary to know the theoretical orbital frequencies with an accuracy that may render post - newtonian approximations inadequate .",
    "similarly , the spacetimes around neutron stars can differ from the kerr black - hole spacetimes to such a degree as to invalidate the use of kerr - based orbital frequencies .",
    "it is our purpose in the present and a companion paper to investigate in some detail orbital motion near the equatorial planes of neutron stars and to test carefully the agreement between the frequencies of bound orbits with the qpo frequencies observed so far in neutron - star lmxbs .",
    "specific qpo models will be compared with the existing data in the companion paper ( markovi & lamb 2000 ) . in the present paper",
    "we study the motion of test particles on orbits of arbitrary eccentricity around rapidly spinning neutron stars .",
    "we pay particular attention to the general - relativistic effects of periastron advance and nodal precession in the neutron stars strong gravitational fields , and compare quantitatively the orbital frequencies associated with these effects with the more readily obtainable frequencies of orbits around kerr black holes on the one hand , and low - order post - newtonian ( pn ) expansions , on the other . as the basis of our study , we set out to develop analytical and numerical techniques for a sufficiently accurate computation of the frequencies of orbits in fully general relativistic numerical neutron star spacetimes .",
    "modern numerical codes ( komatsu , eriguchi & hachisu 1989a , b ; cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1992 , 1994a , b ; stergioulas & friedman 1995 ; nozawa et al .",
    "1998 ) allow an accurate computation of equilibrium uniformly spinning neutron star models starting from an arbitrary tabulated equation of state ( eos ) , and it is one variant ( stergioulas & friedman 1995 ) that we use to obtain external neutron star spacetimes in which we then integrate the equations of motion for bound geodesics .",
    "the numerical neutron star models discussed in this paper are all based on three equations of state that sample a broad range of stiffness , from the moderately stiff eos c ( bethe & johnson 1974 ; see also the early review by arnett & bowers , 1977 ) to the very stiff eos l @xcite .",
    "the classic eos c describes cold nucleon ( _ n _ and _ p _ ) + hyperon ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) matter with the nucleon - nucleon potential represented by a set of yukawa functions .",
    "the high - density behaviour is dominated by the strong short - range repulsion due to the @xmath23-meson exchange .",
    "eos c allows the maximum mass of @xmath24 for non - rotating stars . on the other hand ,",
    "eos l , based on coupling of ( non - relativistic ) nuclear matter to a mean scalar field , provides for a much higher maximum mass , @xmath25 , for non - rotating neutron stars and , accordingly , larger equatorial radii . for the third eos of intermediate stiffness we choose eos uu @xcite , which , besides including the nucleon - nucleon potential ( specifically , the urbana @xmath26 ) , achieves the relatively greater stiffness at high density due to the urbana vii three - nucleon potential ( schiavilla , pandharipande , & wiringa 1986 ) .",
    "the maximum non - rotating ns mass for this eos is @xmath27 . [ the more recent eos a18+uix + @xmath28 of akmal , pandharipande and ravenhall ( 1998 ; see also pandharipande , akmal & ravenhall , 1998 ) is based on the modern argonne @xmath29 two - nucleon potential and the urbana ix three - nucleon potential and allows for the dependence of the interaction between two nucleons on their _ total _ centre - of - mass momentum ; its stiffness is similar to that of eos uu and the maximum non - rotating stellar mass is @xmath30 . ]",
    "these three equations of state span the entire range of eos stiffness that can provide the neutron star masses ( @xmath31 ; from now on all masses will be given in units of solar mass ) and radii required by the qpo models discussed in the companion paper  @xcite .",
    "in section 2 , we derive the equations of motion for a general bound geodesic near the equatorial plane of the stationary spacetime around a neutron star .",
    "the equations of motion involve the values of four radius - dependent potentials ( provided as a tabulated output from a ns - model numerical code ) in the equatorial plane , as well as the potentials second derivatives with respect to the vertical coordinate .",
    "the presence of two integrals of motion , the energy @xmath32 and the vertical component , @xmath33 , of the angular momentum , allows integration of the radial and azimuthal equations up to quadratures ( we specifically solve for _ prograde _ orbits ) . for orbits ( slightly ) tilted relative to the equatorial plane , the lack of a third integral of motion leaves one with two first - order hamilton s equations for the vertical @xmath34motion .",
    "the precession of the orbital plane is then most conveniently analysed by means of floquet s method . in the balance of section 2",
    "we discuss similar motion in the kerr black hole spacetime , where the presence of a third integral of motion , the carter constant , simplifies the treatment considerably .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss low - order post - newtonian expressions for the periastron advance and nodal precession frequencies .    in section 3",
    ", we illustrate , by means of several examples , the salient features of the orbits around neutron stars , devoting most of our discussion to the dependence of the orbital frequencies , @xmath14 , @xmath35 and @xmath17 , on the radii of circular orbits or the periastra and apastra of eccentric orbits ( unless specified otherwise , all radii will be given in units @xmath36 ) .",
    "we pay particular attention to the manner in which the frequency profiles are affected by equations of state of various stiffness .",
    "for instance , the stiffer eos yield neutron stars of greater extent , which , in turn , can exclude highly eccentric orbits with small periastra and low @xmath37 . the larger stellar extent ( and ,",
    "accordingly , greater magnitude of the quadrupole moment @xmath38 ) also reduces significantly the nodal precession frequencies for stars of given mass @xmath12 and angular momentum @xmath39 ( this effect was previously explored for circular orbits by morsink & stella 1999 ) .",
    "we also assess the accuracy of approximating the orbital frequencies in neutron - star spacetimes by the more readily computed frequencies of orbits in kerr spacetimes of the same mass @xmath12 and angular momentum @xmath40 , or by the frequencies obtained from low - order post - newtonian expressions ( including the relatively large mass quadrupole terms characteristic of neutron stars ) .",
    "the results of this paper are summarised and discussed in section 4 .",
    "equipped with accurately computed frequencies of orbits in neutron star spacetimes , we proceed in the companion paper @xcite to investigate the possibility of their matching the qpo frequencies of neutron - star lmxbs .",
    "the code of stergioulas @xcite yields the metric around a neutron star in the form isotropic in the @xmath41 sector @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the four potentials computed numerically .",
    "the integration of orbital equations , described below , requires the four potentials to be given as smooth functions of @xmath47 .",
    "we achieve sufficient smoothness through a combination of spline and high - order chebyshev polynomial representations ( see , e.g. , press _ et al . _ 1992 ) . throughout the paper",

    "[ orbits.ecc ]    the metric components independence of @xmath50 and @xmath51 implies that the components @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the 4-velocity of a test particle are conserved .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath54    assume for the moment a purely equatorial motion , @xmath55 .",
    "the normalisation @xmath56 leads then to the equation for radial motion @xmath57.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for given apastron radius @xmath58 and periastron radius @xmath59 , a bound orbit exists if one can find @xmath33 ( @xmath60 for prograde orbits ) such that @xmath61 ( subscripts denote the values of @xmath47 at which the quantities are evaluated ) , i.e. , such that solve the equations @xmath62 where @xmath63/\\br^2 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] . the required solution exists only if @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the periastron of the marginally bound ( @xmath67 ) orbit .",
    "generally , for @xmath33 and @xmath32 corresponding to a bound orbit , there also is a third root of the equation @xmath68 , closer to the origin , @xmath69 . for the marginally bound orbit @xmath70 , @xmath71",

    "for @xmath78 we naturally have @xmath79 .",
    "once @xmath33 and @xmath32 are found for given @xmath59 and @xmath58 , it is straightforward to obtain the period ( in the distant observer s time @xmath50 ) of radial motion @xmath80 as well as the frequency of azimuthal motion , i.e. , the kepler frequency @xmath81 where @xmath82 \\frac{d\\br}{\\sqrt{f}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ drift.ecc ]    the periastron advance frequency is then simply @xmath83    in the more general case of orbits out of the equatorial plane , the motion is governed by the hamiltonian ( see , e.g. , misner , thorne & wheeler 1973 ) @xmath84 for small displacements , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , from the equatorial plane , we can expand the four potentials , @xmath87 , etc .",

    "the motion in the @xmath88 direction can now be computed from hamilton s equations , given here in the matrix form , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a solution of equation  ( [ drdtau ] ) .",
    "the secular advance of the nodal line ( i.e. , the nodal precession ) is a straightforward consequence of the failure of a particle to return to the initial @xmath88 after a full revolution around the star .",
    "for example , in fig .  1 we plot @xmath98 and @xmath99 for three orbits of common periastron ( circumferential ) radius @xmath100 , which is smaller than @xmath101 for the neutron star of mass @xmath102 , eos uu and spin frequency @xmath103hz ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "notice the gradually increasing phase lag of the meridional motion relative to the azimuthal motion .",
    "this leads to a secular advance of the ascending node ( see fig .  2 ) .    for eccentric orbits ,",
    "the rate of the advance varies somewhat over a few orbital periods @xmath105 : since the radial frequency @xmath37 is much smaller than @xmath14 for orbits close to @xmath106 ( e.g. , in the above example for @xmath107 , @xmath108hz = @xmath109 ) , a particle performs several revolutions ( see the plot of @xmath98 in fig",
    ".  1 ) while lingering close to the periastron , and then moves closer to the apastron where both the rate of revolution and  in particular  the effects of the star s spin and quadrupole deformation ( oblateness ) on the orbital motion are much weaker . however ,",
    "when averaged over several orbital periods , the nodal precession rate is constant , and this _ averaged _ value is what we denote by @xmath17 .",
    "equations  ( [ ham.eq ] ) can be solved by direct integration over a large number of ( proper time ) periods @xmath110 of radial motion to obtain the nodal drift with sufficient accuracy , as was done for fig .  2 .",
    "more economically , the same result can be obtained by floquet s method ( see , e.g. , arnold 1992 or hochstadt 1975 ) , as follows : we define the matrix @xmath111 whose components are the values of the latitude @xmath88 and the associated momenta @xmath89 at the end of a period of radial motion , @xmath112 , @xmath113 for initial conditions @xmath114 ,",

    "notice , however , that for stiff eos and for @xmath224 ( the lower curves of fig .",
    "5 ) the expansion  ( [ np.pn ] ) significantly overestimates the actual @xmath17 which is , e.g. , at the surface of the star , less than @xmath225 of the corresponding kerr value .",
    "[ nunp.exc1.2 ]    [ kerr.exce ]    [ uu.demo ]    [ l.demo ]    turning now to eccentric orbits , one can distinguish between two broad classes , characterised by periastra @xmath226 that are either larger or smaller than @xmath106 . within the first class , @xmath227 ( so that @xmath228 )",
    ", the plots of the orbital frequences as functions of @xmath229 for a family of orbits of common periastron @xmath226 resemble ( an example is shown in fig .",
    "6 ) the frequency vs. radius plots for circular orbits shown above in fig .",
    "the obvious difference is that the magnitudes of the negative slopes @xmath230 are smaller than those of the slopes @xmath231 for circular orbits : even if @xmath229 is large , the eccentric orbits have access to small radii where relativistic effects , like frame dragging , take place .",
    "this can be seen from the pn expansions  ( [ pa.pn ] ) and ( [ np.pn ] ) , in which the effect of increased periastron radius is ` buffered ' by @xmath229 s appearing in the expressions only through @xmath232 , where @xmath233 for @xmath234 [ the dependence on @xmath235 in ( [ pa.pn ] ) is weak ] . for large @xmath229",
    "we therefore expect the ratios @xmath236 and @xmath237 to asymptote to constant values , as indeed is the case ( see fig .",
    "although the pn expressions  ( [ pa.pn ] ) and ( [ np.pn ] ) reproduce qualitatively the profiles @xmath238 and @xmath239 obtained numerically from ns models , they tend to give a somewhat steeper fall - off at large @xmath229 , thus falling short of the ` exact ' values by up to @xmath240 .",
    "this is evident in fig .  7 and is displayed in greater detail in figs .  8 and 9 .",
    "it is a consequence of the extreme slowness of relativistic radial motion in the strong - filed vicinity of @xmath106 : since relativistic effects ( e.g. , frame dragging ) weaken rapidly at larger radii , this gives them more time to build up and the integrated effects thus exceed the pn estimates .",
    "as in the case of circular orbits , the periastron advance frequency @xmath238 is modeled much better for all @xmath229 by the kerr black hole values ( for the same @xmath12 and @xmath198 ; see fig .",
    "8) than by the pn expansion ( [ pa.pn ] ) .",
    "as can be seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "8 , only for @xmath241 does the pn @xmath238 approach closely the values obtained from the numerically computed ns spacetimes .    regarding the nodal precession , for moderately eccentric orbits , @xmath242 , the pn expansion  ( [ np.pn ] ) is superior to the kerr values at modeling @xmath239 obtained from the numerical ns spacetimes ( see fig .",
    ". the better accuracy of the pn frequences is more prominent for stiff eos , in a straightforward extension of the trend we observed for circular orbits .",
    "again , for larger eccentricities , the numerical spacetimes @xmath239 inevitably split off from the pn curves and shift toward the kerr values . as we increase @xmath226 , the range of eccentricity @xmath235 over which the pn expansion is relatively accurate increases ; compare the two panels of fig .",
    "9 .    for the second class of eccentric orbits with @xmath243 , we observe ( see fig",
    ".  10 for eos c and uu ) that at constant @xmath226 the minimum apastron radius , @xmath244 , shrinks rapidly with increasing @xmath198 , following the related reduction of @xmath106 ( for both eos , @xmath245 @xmath246 and @xmath247 for @xmath248 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 , respectively ) . compared with the kerr black hole , the main effect of the larger quadrupole moment of the ns is a larger @xmath244 at given @xmath12 and @xmath198 as well as lower @xmath251 and higher @xmath238 .",
    "notice , however , that as @xmath229 approaches @xmath252 from above , the functions @xmath253 and @xmath239 bend upward abruptly , while @xmath251 drops until it reaches the ` terminal ' value @xmath254 .",
    "the sharp change of @xmath14 near @xmath252 leads to a ` flat ' dependence @xmath255 for a family of orbits of a given @xmath243 ; see fig .",
    "11 for a relatively slow spinning , @xmath256hz , eos uu neutron star . as @xmath226",
    "is increased , the functions @xmath255 at first grow steeper , with increasingly negative slopes at large @xmath14 ( small @xmath229 ) , until at @xmath257 , @xmath37 drops to zero for @xmath258",
    ". a further growth of @xmath226 again brings about flatter functions @xmath255 but at considerably larger @xmath37 .    in fig .",
    "12 we show the functions @xmath255 for eccentric orbits around a @xmath259 , @xmath260hz , eos l neutron star .",
    "the stiff equation of state makes the star large ( @xmath261 km ) so that very low @xmath226 orbits do not exist and the flat , low @xmath37 curves @xmath255 seen in fig .",
    "11 are absent from fig .  12 .",
    "( this is why the plots of frequencies for the low @xmath262 families of orbits in fig .",
    "10 could be shown only for the _ moderately _ stiff eos c and uu . ) as a consequence , the set of frequencies of eccentric orbits ( for given @xmath12 and @xmath194 ) is a much more limited subset of the 2-dimensional @xmath14-@xmath37 plane for the stiff eos l than for the softer equations of state .",
    "if shown to indeed be a manifestation of the orbital motion around neutron stars , the quasi - periodic oscillations of the low mass x - ray binaries would furnish an unprecedented probe of the strongly curved spacetime near the compact objects and allow inference of their masses @xmath12 and spin rates @xmath194 .",
    "in particular , highly eccentric orbits , which near their periastra penetrate deeper than the innermost stable circular orbit , would put tight constraints on the sizes of neutron stars , and thus on the equation of state .    the high accuracy",
    "( e.g. , better than @xmath263 for sco  x-1 ) , with which the frequencies of the khz qpo frequencies have been measured , makes it important to use the values obtained by integrating test - particle motion in fully relativistic numerical spacetimes that can be computed by spinning neutron star codes . for @xmath264 , and especially for orbits of considerable eccentricity , the post - newtonian ( pn ) expansions or approximation with kerr metric orbital frequencies are not sufficiently accurate .    in the case of the periastron advance frequency @xmath15",
    ", the kerr results provide a better approximation to actual motion in the neutron star spacetimes than do the low - order pn expressions .",
    "although the kerr @xmath265 is always lower than the value @xmath15 for the same periastron and apastron ( circumferential ) radii in a neutron - star spacetime , it never falls below @xmath15 by more than 10% , even for the highest angular momenta investigated here ( @xmath266 ) and for the stiffest eos ( l ) .",
    "the general - relativistic decrease of @xmath37 in the vicinity of the innermost stable orbit ( isco ) makes the pn approximations for @xmath15 inaccurate even for moderately ( @xmath267 ) eccentric orbits if @xmath268 ( for highly eccentric orbits , pn is typically a poor approximation ) .",
    "the nodal precession frequency @xmath17 of orbits inclined relative to the equatorial plane of a neutron star is dominated by the prograde gravitomagnetic ` torque , ' with a large retrograde ( for prograde orbits ) contribution from the classical quadrupole torque . in the cases considered in this paper ,",
    "the latter torque can amount at small orbital radii from about @xmath269 to up to about @xmath270 of the magnitude of the gravitomagnetic torque .",
    "the spin - induced deformation ( oblateness ) of the neutron stars renders , therefore , the low - pn @xmath17 far more adequate ( for orbits of moderate eccentricity ) than the values obtained from kerr black holes with the same @xmath12 and @xmath198 . however , for orbits of very small size ( @xmath271 ) , even the low - order pn expressions overestimate @xmath17 by up to 30% in the case of @xmath266 , stiff eos l models",
    ".    very stiff equations of state ( e.g. , l ) have an important effect on the high - frequency portion of the set of all available frequencies @xmath14 , @xmath37 of eccentric orbits : due to the large stellar equatorial radii , orbits with very low periastra do not exist .",
    "the consequent absence of low values of @xmath37 at @xmath272 , for given @xmath12 and @xmath194 , restricts severely the available subset of the @xmath14-@xmath37 plane .",
    "for this reason , very stiff equations of state do not permit successful modeling of the neutron - star lmxbs khz qpo frequencies in terms of the frequencies of eccentric orbits ( see markovic & lamb 2000 ) .",
