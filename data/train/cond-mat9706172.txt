    "here we demonstrate several of numerous examples of analogy between high energy physics and superfluid @xmath1he .",
    "we consider 3 types of topologically stable linear defects in @xmath1he - a , which exhibit the properties of different types of cosmic strings .",
    "the `` gravity '' and the axial anomaly in the presence of such defects are discussed .",
    "the quasiparticles in @xmath1he - a are chiral and massless fermions . close to the gap nodes , ie at @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is unit vector in the direction of the gap nodes in the momentum space ) the energy spectrum @xmath4 of the gapless a - phase fermions are `` relativistic '' @xcite : @xmath5 here the `` vector potential '' @xmath6 is dynamical : @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ; and the metric tensor is @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) are `` speeds of light '' propagating transverse to @xmath3 and along @xmath3 correspondingly ; @xmath13 is the fermi momentum ; @xmath14 is the fermi velocity ; @xmath15 is the mass of @xmath1he atom ; @xmath16 is the gap amplitude in @xmath1he - a .    in the presence of superflow with the superfluid velocity @xmath17 the following term",
    "is added to the energy @xmath4 : @xmath18 the second term corresponds to the scalar potential @xmath19 of the `` electromagnetic field '' , while the first one leads to the nonzero element @xmath20 of the metric tensor . as a result the eq.(1.1 ) transforms to @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the metric tensor @xmath24",
    "the so called radial disgyration is one of the topologically stable linear defects in @xmath1he - a .",
    "this is an axisymmetric distribution of the @xmath3 vector @xmath25 where @xmath26 are unit vectors of the cylindrical coordinate system with @xmath27 along the axis of the defect line .",
    "the vector potential @xmath28 can be removed by gauge transformation since the `` magnetic '' field is zero : @xmath29 .",
    "thus the radial disgyration provides only the `` gravity '' field , acting on the @xmath1he - a fermions , with the metric tensor @xmath30 the interval corresponding to this metric @xmath31 has a conical singularity ( if @xmath32 ) with curvarture being concentrated at the axis of disgyration ( @xmath33 ) @xcite .",
    "the space is flat everywhere outside the axis but the length of circumference of radius @xmath34 around the axis is @xmath35 . since @xmath36 ,",
    "this is analogous to rather unusual cosmic string with a very big positive or negative mass @xmath37 per unit length : @xmath38 since the linear mass @xmath39 corresponds to the chain of the point masses @xmath40 with the distance between the neighbouring masses equal twice the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath41 : @xmath42 ) the case @xmath43 corresponds to the chain of the overlapping black holes .",
    "the most symmetric vortex in @xmath1he - a can be realized in thin films where the vector @xmath3 is fixed along the normal to the film , while the superfluid velocity is circulating around the vortex axis : @xmath44 the `` magnetic '' field and the scalar potential are absent ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "one has again only the gravity field , now with the metric tensor @xmath47 the corresponding interval is @xcite @xmath48 there are two important properties of this interval :    \\(1 ) there is a region , where the velocity field @xmath49 exceeds the transverse speed of light , @xmath50 .",
    "this is the ` ergoregion ' : the vacuum in the ergoregion is unstable towards creation of pairs of particles .",
    "\\(2 ) far from the vortex axis , where @xmath49 is small and can be neglected : @xmath51 where the angular velocity @xmath52 this metric corresponds to that outside the so called spinning cosmic string @xcite , which has the angular momentum in the core . in our case this is unusual spinning string with the angular momentum @xmath53 per unit length ( @xmath54 is the gravitational constant ) , but with zero mass .",
    "the connection between the time and the angle in eq.(3.4 ) suggests @xcite that the energy @xmath55 and angular momentum @xmath56 of fermions on the background of this spinning string are related as @xmath57 the spectrum of bound states in the core of this vortex was calculated by kopnin @xcite .",
    "he found that the factor @xmath58 in eq.(3.6 ) is of the same order , though is not equal to that in eq.(3.5 ) .",
    "what is more important , the calculated @xmath58 appeared to be independent of the momentum @xmath59 along the vortex axis in a complete agreement with eq.(3.5 ) .",
    "this is distinct from the spectrum of bound states in the core of vortices in other systems : in @xmath60-wave superconductors and in @xmath1he - b there is an essential dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath59.@xcite",
    "the continuous vortex , discussed by chechetkin @xcite and anderson and toulouse@xcite ( atc vortex ) , has the following distribution of @xmath3 and @xmath17 fields : @xmath62{\\hat { \\bf \\phi}}~~ , \\eqno(4.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath63 changes from @xmath64 to @xmath65 in the so called soft core of the vortex .",
    "the stationary vortex generates the `` magnetic '' field and when the vortex moves with a constant velocity @xmath66 it also generates the `` electric '' field , since @xmath6 depends on @xmath67 : @xmath68 the quantum vacuum with massles chiral fermions exhibits the axial anomaly : the presence of the electric and magnetic fields leads to the production of left particles from the vacuum at the rate@xcite @xmath69    in @xmath1he - a there are two species of fermions , left and right , with @xmath8 .",
    "the left quasiparticle carries the linear momentum @xmath70 , while the righthanded quasiparticle carries the opposite momentum @xmath71 .",
    "this asymmetry between left and right gives the net product of the fermionic linear momentum @xmath72 in the time - dependent texture : @xmath73    integration of the anomalous momentum transfer in eq.(4.4 ) over the cross - section of the soft core of the moving atc vortex gives the rate of the momentum transfer between the condensate ( vacuum ) and the heat bath ( matter ) , mediated by the moving vortex @xcite : @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the winding number of the vortex ( @xmath76 in the case of eq.(4.1 ) ) and @xmath77 .",
    "this `` momentogenesis '' from the vacuum gives an extra nondissipative force acting on the moving continuous vortex .",
    "this result , derived for the atc vortex from the axial anomaly equation ( 4.3 ) , was confirmed in the microscopic theory , which took into accout the discreteness of the quasiparticle spectrum in the soft core @xcite .",
    "this was also confirmed in experiments on vortex dynamics in @xmath1he - a @xcite , where it was found that the extra force on the vortex nearly cancels the conventional magnus force .    in the weinberg - salam model",
    "the similar asymmetry between left and right leads to the `` baryogenesis ''  production of the baryonic charge in the presence of the @xmath78 and @xmath79 fields .",
    "such fields can be generated in the core of the topological defects ( monopoles , domain walls , sphalerons and electroweak cosmic strings ) evolving in the expanding universe @xcite .",
    "experiments in @xmath1he - a and also in @xmath1he - b@xcite , where the `` momentogenesis '' due to the axial anomaly in the singular core has been measured in a broad temperature range , support ideas on electroweak baryogenesis in early universe .",
    "we discussed here only a very small fraction of the analogies which can simulate numerous phenomena in particle physics and gravitation .    in superfluid @xmath1he it is very often that the container walls prevent the conducting of the `` pure '' experiments .",
    "such nonsuperfluid environment should be removed since the universe , according to our present knowledge , has no external environment .",
    "one example : in the process of nucleation of quantized vortices ( the phenomenon which is now believed to be important in the cosmological models @xcite ) the surface roughness of container dominates over the intrinsic nucleation . but only the latter is interesting for the cosmological community .",
    "the absence of gravity gives us a chance to produce the free droplet without the container boundaries and thus to deal with the pure intrinsic nucleation .",
    "the rotation of a free droplet @xmath1he - a liquid can be made by utilizing the unique magnetic properties of superfluid 3he : one can apply the rotating magnetic field .",
    "another interesting problem related to the droplets of @xmath1he is the dependence of its superfluid properties on the size of droplet .",
    "the extreme case  the cluster with a small number @xmath80 of @xmath1he atoms  corresponds to the other finite system  atomic nucleus which also represents the cluster of fermions ( protons and neutrons ) .",
    "these clusters have very similar properties , determined by their fermionic quantum statistics and interaction : shell structure , magic numbers , single and collective excitations , rotational degrees of freedom , fission and fusion , deformed and superdeformed states of clusters with large angular momentum , the superfluid ( pair - correlated ) properties of nuclei which evolve with increasing @xmath80 , etc . the advantage of @xmath1he clusters , that it is relatively easy to study them using the nmr technique ."
