    "the planet is the most massive transiting planet yet reported .",
    "it is also one of only 4 transiting planets with an obviously noncircular orbit .",
    "how such a massive planet formed , how it achieved its tight orbit , and why the orbit is eccentric , are interesting unanswered questions , and precise determinations of the basic system parameters may help to answer them .    found that a key parameter  the planetary radius  was especially uncertain , with an allowed range from 1.17 to 2.10 times the radius of jupiter .",
    "this wide range encompassed the results of two different methods for determining the planetary radius that gave discrepant values .",
    "they found that if the true radius is near the low end of this range , it can be accommodated by ordinary models for gas giants of solar composition with the given mass and degree of insolation , while if the radius is near the high end of the allowed range , more complex and interesting models would require consideration ( see , e.g. , guillot & showman 2002 , bodenheimer et al .",

    "we summarize , and revisit the issue of the planetary radius and its theoretical interpretation , in light of the new data .",

    "we defocused the telescope slightly to permit exposure times of 10 - 15  s without saturating the brightest star in the field .",
    "we also obtained dome - flat exposures and bias exposures for calibration purposes .    on the other 6 nights",

    "the flux of xo-3 was divided by the sum of the fluxes of the comparison stars , and then divided by a constant to give a unit mean flux outside of transit . for the other data ,",
    "only 2 comparison stars were used .",
    "it was found in almost all cases that the out - of - transit ( oot ) flux was not a constant over the course of the night , perhaps due to the effects of differential atmospheric extinction or slow drifts in focus , pixel position , or other external variables . to compensate , we solved for the `` oot baseline function , '' a linear function of time , as part of the fitting process described in the next section .",
    "figures  1 and 2 show the final light curves .",
    "figure  3 is a composite @xmath8-band light curve based on all of the flwo data .",
    "table  2 provides all of the data in numerical form .",
    "in order to determine the stellar , planetary , and orbital parameters , we fitted a parametric model to the 13 photometric time series , as well as the 21 radial velocity measurements of .",
    "our model and fitting method were similar to those described in previous tlc papers ( see , e.g. , holman et al .",
    "2006 , winn et al .",
    "it is based on a keplerian orbit of two spherical bodies .",
    "the physical parameters were the stellar mass and radius ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) ; the planetary mass and radius ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) ; the orbital period , inclination , eccentricity , and argument of pericenter ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) ; and a particular midtransit time ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "in addition , for each of the two velocity data sets presented by  ( from the hobby - eberly telescope and the harlan j.  smith telescope ) , we allowed for an arbitrary additive constant velocity .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we also fitted for a linear function of time describing the oot flux ( 2 parameters per light curve ) .",
    "a well - known degeneracy involves both of the bodies masses and radii .",
    "only 3 of those 4 parameters can be determined independently .",
    "three parameters that _ can _ be determined independently are @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( seager & mallen - ornelas  2003 ) , and @xmath33 ( southworth et al .",
    "2007 ) . rather than reparameterizing in terms of those variables ,",
    "we find it more convenient to fix the stellar mass at some fiducial value and then use the scaling relations @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 as needed .    to calculate the relative flux as a function of the projected separation of the planet and the star , we employed the analytic formulas of mandel & agol  ( 2002 ) to compute the integral of the intensity over the unobscured portion of the stellar disk .",
    "we assumed the limb darkening law to be quadratic . in some previous studies ,",
    "including our own , the limb - darkening coefficients have been fixed at the tabulated values based on stellar - atmosphere models .",
    "a more conservative approach is to fit for the limb - darkening law , since the actual stellar brightness distribution is not known and may differ from the tabulated limb - darkening law .",
    "however , it is generally not possible to constrain more than one free parameter in the limb - darkening law . following the suggestion by southworth  ( 2008 ) ,",
    "our approach was to allow the linear coefficient ( @xmath37 ) to vary freely , and to fix the quadratic coefficient ( @xmath38 ) at the appropriate value tabulated by claret  ( 2004 ) . to determine the `` theoretical '' values of the limb - darkening coefficients , we interpolated the atlas tables for the stellar parameters @xmath39  k , @xmath40  ( cgs ) , [ fe / h]@xmath41 and @xmath42  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the interpolated values are given in table  4 , as well as the results for the fitted linear coefficient .",
    "the fitting statistic was @xmath43 ^ 2 +   \\sum_{j=1}^{6104 } \\left [ \\frac{f_j({\\mathrm{obs } } ) - f_j({\\mathrm{calc}})}{\\sigma_{f , j } } \\right]^2 , \\label{eq : chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath44(obs ) is the radial velocity observed at time @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the corresponding uncertainty , and @xmath44(calc ) is the calculated radial velocity .",
    "a similar notation applies to the fluxes @xmath47 . for the velocity uncertainties",
    ", we used the values reported by . for the flux uncertainties",
    ", we used a procedure that attempts to account for time - correlated ( `` red '' ) noise , at least approximately . for each of the 13 observed transits",
    ", we set the uncertainty of each data point equal to the root - mean - squared ( rms ) relative flux observed out of transit , multiplied by a factor @xmath48 .",
    "the factor @xmath49 was determined using two different methods ( described at the end of this section ) , and the larger of the two results was used in our final analysis .",
    "we found the `` best fitting '' values of the model parameters , and their uncertainties , using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm [ see tegmark et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for applications to cosmological data , ford ( 2005 ) for radial - velocity data , holman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) or winn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for our particular implementation , and burke et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for a similar approach ] .",
    "this algorithm creates a chain of points in parameter space by iterating a jump function , which in our case was the addition of a gaussian random deviate to a randomly - selected single parameter .",
    "if the new point has a lower @xmath50 than the previous point , the jump is executed ; if not , the jump is executed with probability @xmath51 .",
    "we set the sizes of the random deviates such that @xmath5240% of jumps are executed .",
    "we create a number of chains from different starting conditions to verify they all converge to the same basin in parameter space , and then we merge them for our final results .",
    "the phase - space density of points in the chain is an estimate of the joint _ a posteriori _ probability distribution of all the parameters , from which may be calculated the probability distribution for an individual parameter by marginalizing over all of the others .",
    "the fitting procedure had 4 basic steps .",
    "first , we performed a joint fit of all the light curves along with the radial velocities , to determine provisional values of the orbital period and physical parameters .",
    "second , we measured individual midtransit times , by performing a mcmc analysis of each light curve with only three free parameters : the zero point and slope of the linear function describing the out - of - transit flux , and the midtransit time .",
    "we fixed @xmath25 , @xmath23 , and @xmath27 at the best - fitting values determined from the ensemble .",
    "there is no need to fit the midtransit times simultaneously with @xmath53 because the errors in those parameters are uncorrelated with the error in the midtransit time .",
    "third , we recomputed the transit ephemeris using the newly measured midtransit times ( see   [ subsec : ephemeris ] for more details on this step ) .",
    "fourth , we fixed the orbital period and midtransit times at the values just determined , and performed another joint fit of all the radial - velocity and photometric data , to obtain final estimates of the model parameters and their uncertainties .",
    "the results from this final computation did not differ significantly from the results of the initial joint fit .    as mentioned previously , we used two different methods to estimate the factor @xmath49 by which time - correlated noise effectively increases the flux uncertainties .",
    "we refer to the first method as the `` time - averaging '' method , which has been described previously by winn et al .",
    "( 2007b ) and is closely related to a method used by gillon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . for each light curve we found the best - fitting model and calculated @xmath54 , the standard deviation of the unbinned residuals between the observed and calculated fluxes .",
    "next we averaged the residuals into @xmath55 bins of @xmath56 points and calculated the standard deviation @xmath57 of the binned residuals . in the absence of red noise , we would have expected in previous analyses .",
    "typically @xmath58 and this factor is smaller than 1.12 . ] @xmath59 but often @xmath57 is larger than this by a factor @xmath49 .",
    "we found that @xmath49 depends only weakly on the choice of averaging time @xmath60 , generally rising to an asymptotic value at @xmath61  min .",
    "we denote by @xmath62 the median of these factors when using averaging times ranging from 15 - 30  min ( the approximate duration of ingress or egress ) .",
    "we refer to the second method as the `` rosary - bead '' method , which has been used previously by many investigators ( e.g. , bouchy et al .",
    "2005 , southworth  2008 ) . for each light curve",
    ", we found the best - fitting model and computed the time series of @xmath56 residuals .",
    "we then added these residuals to the model light curve after time - shifting them by @xmath55 samples with a periodic boundary condition , i.e. , the @xmath27th residual was assigned to the time stamp @xmath63  mod  @xmath56 .",
    "we repeated this for all @xmath64 , then fitted each of these synthetic light curves and took the standard deviation of the results to be the error estimates for the parameters .",
    "this is a variant of the well - known bootstrap technique that preserves the temporal correlations among the residuals .",
    "we denote by @xmath65 the ratio between the error estimate returned by the rosary - bead method , and the error estimate assuming uncorrelated errrors .",
    "in general @xmath62 and @xmath65 are specific to each parameter of the model , but for simplicity we assumed they are the same for all parameters , and to calculate them we focused on the determination of midtransit times . for each of the 13 light curves we compared the error bar in @xmath30 as obtained through the time - averaging method , and as obtained with the rosary - bead method .",
    "for the 13 light curves , @xmath66 varied from 0.86 to 1.47 , with a mean of 1.13 and a standard deviation of 0.21 .",
    "thus the two methods gave similar results , and the rosary - bead method tended to produce larger error estimates .",
    "for our final results , we assigned each light curve the value @xmath67 .",
    "these choices of @xmath49 are given in table  1 .",
    "all of these procedures may be fairly criticized for lacking statistical rigor , but experience has shown that the more common procedure of setting @xmath68 results in underestimated uncertainties in the model parameters , as demonstrated by a lack of agreement between the results of different but presumably equivalent data sets .",
    "table  1 gives all of the newly measured transit times .",
    "table  3 gives the results for the planetary , stellar , and orbital parameters , as well as many other quantities of intrinsic interest or importance for planning follow - up observations .",
    "as an example of the latter , the quantity @xmath69 is the planet - to - star flux ratio at opposition , for a geometric albedo of unity , and as such it is relevant to pursuing observations of reflected light from the planet .",
    "another example is the amplitude of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , given by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the projected rotation rate of the star ( see , e.g. , gaudi & winn 2007 ) .",
    "the labels a  e , explained in the table caption , are an attempt to clarify which quantities are determined independently from our analysis , which quantities are functions of those independent parameters , and which quantities depend on our isochrone analysis to break the fitting degeneracy between the stellar mass and radius .",
    "table  4 gives the results for the limb - darkening coefficients .      as discussed in the previous section",
    ", the joint analysis of the light curves and velocities can not independently determine the masses and radii of both bodies .",
    "some external information about the star or the planet must be introduced to break the fitting degeneracies @xmath36 and @xmath72 .",
    "our approach was to seek consistency between the observed spectroscopic properties of the star , the stellar mean density that is derived from the transit light curves , and theoretical models of stellar evolution .",
    "this is the same approach ( and uses the same software ) that was described in detail by sozzetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and torres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . here",
    "we summarize the procedure , and refer the reader to those papers for more details .",
    "there were two sets of inputs .",
    "first , we used the values of the effective temperature @xmath73 , surface gravity @xmath74 , and metallicity [ fe / h ] of the host star , as reported by , based on a parametric fit to the optical spectrum of xo-3 using the _ spectroscopy made easy _",
    "( sme ) program ( valenti & piskunov 1996 , valenti & fischer 2005 ) .",
    "second , we used the scaled semimajor axis @xmath75 and the orbital parameters from our joint analysis of the photometry and radial - velocity data . given @xmath75 and the orbital parameters , it is possible to derive the mean stellar density , using kepler s law ( seager & mallen - ornelas  2003 ) .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath76 to refer to the mean density determined in this fashion .",
    "we used the yonsei - yale ( y@xmath4 ) stellar evolution models by yi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and demarque et al .",
    "we computed isochrones for the full range of metallicities allowed by the data , and for stellar ages ranging from 0.1 to 14  gyr , seeking points that gave agreement with the observed @xmath73 and one of the two gravity indicators ( @xmath74 and @xmath76 ) . for each stellar property ( mass , radius , and age )",
    ", we took a weighted average of the points on each isochrone .",
    "the weights were based on the agreement with the observed temperature , metallicity , and gravity indicator , and a factor taking into account the number density of stars along each isochrone ( assuming a salpeter mass function ) .    in almost all of the 23 cases examined by torres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the results when using either @xmath74 or @xmath76 as the gravity indicator were in agreement , and greater precision was obtained with @xmath76 , often by a factor of 2 or more .",
    "torres et al .  (",
    "2008 ) did not consider the case of xo-3 , but using the same technique we find poor agreement between the results of using the two independent gravity indicators .",
    "using @xmath76 results in a less massive and smaller star , with a higher mean density and a stronger surface gravity .",
    "this in turn gives a less massive and smaller planet .",
    "one way to frame the discrepancy is that by using @xmath76 as the gravity indicator , the isochrone analysis gives a stellar surface gravity of @xmath77 , as compared to the sme - derived value of @xmath78 .",
    "the difference is @xmath79 , which is inconsistent with zero at the 4@xmath80 level .",
    "clearly something is amiss with either our interpretation of the light curve , or the sme determination of @xmath74 , or both .",
    "the same conflict was already apparent between the light - curve analysis and the isochrone analysis of .",
    "we have improved the precision of the light - curve parameters by factors of 3 or more , and the conflict with the spectroscopic determination of @xmath74 has been sharpened .",
    "some further thoughts on the tension between @xmath76 and @xmath74 are given in ",
    "5 . for the results given in table  3 , we proceeded under the assumption that the error in the spectroscopic determination of @xmath74 was greatly underestimated .",
    "we disregarded the spectroscopic @xmath74 while performing the isochrone analysis , and we also increased the error bars on @xmath73 and [ fe / h ] , since the errors in those three quantities are highly correlated when fitting models to the features observed in optical spectra .",
    "we increased the error in @xmath73 from 50  k to 100  k , and in [ fe / h ] from 0.023  dex to 0.08  dex , which we believe to be conservative choices , and are consistent with similar judgments made by torres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in their homogeneous analysis of transiting systems .",
    "we calculated a photometric ephemeris for the transits of xo-3 using the 13 midtransit times given in table  1 and the 16 midtransit times measured by the xo extended team and reported previously by .",
    "we fitted a linear function of transit epoch @xmath81",
    ", @xmath82 the fit had @xmath83 with 27 degrees of freedom , or @xmath84 .",
    "the results were @xmath85  [ hjd ] and @xmath86  days .",
    "our derived period agrees with the value @xmath87  days determined by and is about 20 times more precise .",
    "figure  4 is the o@xmath88c ( observed minus calculated ) diagram for the transit times . in this calculation",
    ", we did not use the 4 midtransit times that were based on data from the xo survey instrument , because those data had unquantified and apparently large uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , all of the observed times are plotted in figure  3 , and are seen to be at least roughly consistent with the new ephemeris .    to help in planning observations of occultations ( secondary",
    "eclipses ) of xo-3b , we have also used our model results to predict the timing , duration , and impact parameter of the occultations .",
    "because of the eccentric orbit , occultations and transits are not separated by exactly one - half of the orbital period , and do not have the same duration or impact parameter . based on our model of the system , we expect occultations to occur @xmath89  days after transits .",
    "the predicted occultation ephemeris is given in table  3 .",
    "we have presented new photometry spanning transits of the exoplanet xo-3 .",
    "the photometry greatly improves the precision with which the light - curve parameters are known . in particular ,",
    "the planet - to - star radius ratio is known to within 0.6% , an improvement by a factor of 6 .",
    "the inclination angle is now known to within 0.54  deg , an improvement by a factor of 2.5 .",
    "a third light - curve parameter , the scaled semimajor axis ( @xmath75 ) , has also been refined by a factor of a few , and was used ( along with the orbital period and kepler s law ) to calculate @xmath76 , the stellar mean density .",
    "we found that the photometric result for @xmath76 is incompatible ( at the 4@xmath80 level ) with the previous spectroscopic determination of @xmath74 , in the sense that theoretical stellar - evolution models can not accommodate both values along with the observed effective temperature and metallicity of the star .",
    "because of this conflict , it is worth reviewing how @xmath76 and @xmath74 were determined .",
    "the photometric determination of @xmath76 is based on a fit to the light curve with 3 relevant free parameters , and the application of kepler s law ( seager & mallen - ornelas 2003 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic determination of @xmath74 is based on the interpretation of pressure - sensitive features of the stellar spectrum , especially the widths of the wings of selected absorption lines .",
    "the interpretation is performed by comparison to theoretical models of stellar atmospheres . for xo-3",
    "this comparison was performed with sme ( valenti & piskunov  1996 , valenti & fischer  2005 ) , an automated analysis program that fits a model to an optical spectrum by adjusting many free parameters , of which the most relevant are the effective temperature , surface gravity , projected rotation rate , and metal abundances . the model is based on plane - parallel stellar atmosphere models in local thermodynamic equilibrium , and reasonable assumptions regarding instrumental broadening and turbulent broadening mechanisms .",
    "empirical corrections are applied to the parameters based on an sme analysis of the solar spectrum .",
    "the spectroscopic method for determining @xmath74 is more complex than the photometric method for determining @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , it is important to recognize that the quoted error in the spectroscopic determination of  ( @xmath78 ) represents the standard error of the mean of the results of fitting 10 independent spectra of xo-3 .",
    "thus , the error bar refers to the repeatability or precision of the result , and not its accuracy .",
    "valenti & fischer  ( 2005 ) assessed the accuracy of sme by comparing two methods of determining surface gravity : ( 1 ) the purely spectroscopic method described in the previous paragraph ; ( 2 ) the surface gravity that follows from the observed stellar luminosity ( for stars with measured parallaxes ) , effective temperature , and metallicity , by requiring consistency with theoretical isochrones of stellar - evolution models .",
    "they found a systematic offset of 0.1  dex and a large scatter ( see   7.4 of that work ) .",
    "repeated this comparison for stars with similar temperatures to xo-3 , finding a scatter of about 0.1  dex and some cases in which the discrepancy is @xmath900.3  dex .",
    "valenti & fischer  ( 2005 ) also compared the sme results for @xmath74 with spectroscopic results that have been obtained by other authors , finding a scatter of about 0.15  dex , and discrepancies as large as 0.3  dex .",
    "these general comparisons can not speak to the specific case of xo-3 , but they suggest that the 4@xmath80 discrepancy between the spectroscopic and photometric methods in the present study is not as serious as it may seem .",
    "the true error in the spectroscopic determination of @xmath74 is probably larger than 0.062 .",
    "an upward revision of the stellar @xmath74 corresponds to a downward revision of the planetary radius , to @xmath91  @xmath1 .",
    "how does this result compare to the radius that is expected on theoretical grounds ?",
    "fortney et al .  (",
    "2007 ) have computed models for planets over a wide range of masses , compositions , ages , and irradiation levels , and provided the results in a convenient tabular form .",
    "interpolation of those tables for a coreless , pure hydrogen - helium planet with properties appropriate for the xo-3 system ( @xmath92  @xmath93 , @xmath94  au , @xmath95  @xmath96 , age  2.82  gyr ) gives a theoretical radius of 1.14  @xmath1 .",
    "adding as much as @xmath52100  @xmath97 of heavy elements would decrease the theoretical radius by a few per cent . on the other hand , the models of fortney et al .",
    "( 2008 ) define the planetary surface as the 1  bar pressure level , whereas a much lower pressure is appropriate for comparison to transit observations .",
    "this `` transit radius effect '' will increase the theoretical radius by a few per cent ( burrows et al .",
    "assuming the combination of these effects to be small , the observed radius is 1@xmath80 larger than the theoretical radius .",
    "thus , the photometric analysis leads to a planetary radius that is only a little larger than the models of fortney et al .",
    "( 2007 ) would predict , similar to the case of hat - p-1b ( winn et al .",

    "although we have argued that the photometric determination of @xmath76 should take precedence over the spectroscopic determination of @xmath74 , it would be more definitive to settle the issue by measuring the trigonometric parallax of xo-3 , as suggested by .",
    "our photometric analysis predicts that the distance will be found to be @xmath98  pc , based on the stellar luminosity inferred from theoretical isochrones , the @xmath21 magnitude of @xmath99 , and the assumption of negligible extinction . the spectrosopic analysis of  predicted a greater distance , @xmath100  pc .",
    "an interesting but more challenging prospect for determining the stellar mass ( and hence its radius ) is to measure the general - relativistic periastron precession of @xmath101  yr@xmath14 by precise long - term timing of transits and occultations ( heyl & gladman 2007 ) .",
    "in addition to pinning down the correct value of the radius , there are other reasons to pursue further observations of xo-3 , of which many are related to its sizable orbital eccentricity .",
    "one consequence of the eccentricity is that the planet experiences significant variations in stellar insolation over the 3.2  d orbital period .",
    "the time - variable response of the planet s atmosphere may be detectable through mid - infrared photometry ( langton & laughlin 2008 ) .",
    "whatever mechanism produced the large eccentricity may also have produced a large inclination angle relative to the stellar equatorial plane , an angle that can be measured through observations of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",

    "( 2007 ) have presented this type of evidence for a significant orbital tilt in the hd  17156 system .",
    "if , on the other hand , the stellar rotation axis is well - aligned with the orbital axis , then the combination of the measurements of @xmath102 , @xmath27 , and @xmath23 give a stellar rotation period of @xmath103  days .",
    "this is not too far from the orbital period of 3.19  days , suggesting that spin - orbit interactions may be unusually strong , perhaps even strong enough to excite the orbital eccentricity to the observed value .",
    "another way to produce an eccentricity is through stable long - term gravitational interactions with another planet .",
    "although the midtransit times we have recorded are nearly consistent with a constant period , and hence do not provide _ prima facie _ evidence for any additional bodies in the system , we have achieved a precision of 1 - 2  min using relatively small telescopes .",
