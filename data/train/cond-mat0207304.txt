    "it is generally accepted that percolation is an essential aspect of gelation or vulcanization  it is doubtful that even in a highly entangled melt of long polymers a nonzero value of the static shear modulus could exist in the absence of an infinite connected network .",
    "however , percolation has usually been studied in rather special limits .",
    "site and bond percolation of a single species on regular lattices are very well characterized and off - lattice percolation seems to present no new features @xcite , at least insofar as critical behavior is concerned .",
    "more closely related to real gels are the so - called correlated percolation models where the distribution of crosslinks is drawn from a boltzmann distribution appropriate for a nearest neighbor lattice gas @xcite .",
    "except at special points in the phase diagram these models are also in the universality class of the simple percolation problem . in our previous work on transport properties near the gel point @xcite ,",
    "we have also used a simple one - species percolation process to produce the incipient gel .",
    "we found that the shear viscosity diverges as the percolation concentration @xmath2 is approached according to @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "this value of the exponent @xmath4 is in excellent agreement with a prediction of de gennes based on a superconductor - normal conductor analogy @xcite and with recent analytical work on a rouse model @xcite .",
    "it is also reasonably close to some experimental results for @xmath4 @xcite but quite different from that produced by another set of experiments @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to ask if different versions of the crosslinking process might produce significantly different cluster size distributions from percolation and , consequently , different rheological properties .",
    "gelation often occurs in the presence of a solvent and over some period of time rather than instantaneously , as in the usual percolation models . to simulate this feature ,",
    "we have considered a two - species model consisting of a fraction @xmath8 of @xmath0-functional particles that are eligible to bond irreversibly to others of the same kind .",
    "the remaining particles are inert and function as a background liquid through which the gel particles and clusters diffuse .",
    "crosslinking occurs in stages : the equations of motion of all the particles are integrated forward for a fixed number of time steps between crosslinking attempts and this process is continued until the desired number of crosslinks is attained . at a critical concentration of crosslinks , @xmath2 , ( in the thermodynamic limit ) the largest cluster percolates and an amorphous solid forms . for this process one can calculate the usual static or geometrical quantities used to characterize percolating systems , _",
    "e.g. _ , the fraction of particles on the ` infinite cluster ' , @xmath9 , the mean mass of finite clusters , @xmath10 , the fraction of samples percolating @xmath11 , the cluster size distribution @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass of a cluster and the radius of gyration @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fractal dimension of the clusters . for simple percolation processes , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and",
    "these two exponents determine the others through scaling relations @xcite . here",
    "we find , at least for small @xmath8 , that the cluster size distribution , even at @xmath2 , is not well described by a simple power law .",
    "however , the other static quantities listed above do display power law behavior near @xmath2 and a standard finite - size scaling analysis provides a very good collapse of our data .",
    "moreover , the hyperscaling relation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the dimensionality and @xmath20 the correlation length exponent , is satisfied .",
    "this suggests that this percolation transition is fundamentally describable in terms of a fixed point with two ( at least ) relevant scaling fields .",
    "as the percolation point is approached from below , the shear viscosity diverges according to @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to our previous work on a model without solvent , we find values of @xmath4 in the range @xmath21 as compared with @xmath6 .",
    "these results suggest that the critical behavior of transport coefficients of systems close to the gel point is nonuniversal .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the present model and simulation procedures in more detail .",
    "the geometric properties of the system are discussed in section [ sec : percolation ] and the data on the shear viscosity are presented in section [ sec : visco ] .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and discussion in section [ sec : discu ] .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath22 particles in three dimensions , all of which interact with each other through the soft - sphere potential @xmath23 for @xmath24 @xcite with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we simulated systems at a volume fraction @xmath27 which is well below the liquid - solid coexistence density . in the absence of any other interactions ,",
    "this system would be a simple three - dimensional liquid .",
    "we initially place the particles on a simple cubic lattice that fills the computational box .",
    "we then randomly select @xmath28 particles to be the gel forming component .",
    "after equilibration of the system with brownian dynamics , with periodic boundary conditions , for 10000 time steps we begin the crosslinking process . at this point , the calculation proceeds via _ conservative _ molecular dynamics ( md ) so as to allow hydrodynamic modes to develop .",
    "here we use a time step @xmath29 . in the smallest system ,",
    "crosslinking is carried out one bond at a time .",
    "a single gel particle is randomly selected and all other gel particles within a distance of @xmath30 are identified .",
    "one of the particles in this list is randomly selected and bonded irreversibly to the central particle through the tethering potential @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "each gel particle is allowed to bond to no more than six others and bonding between any pair of particles occurs at most once .",
    "the configuration of the entire system is then updated for 100 time steps and the entire bonding process is repeated until @xmath34 crosslinks have been added .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is analogous to the occupation probability in a bond percolation process on the simple cubic lattice . in larger systems ,",
    "the number of crosslinks added in the bonding steps is scaled by the system size in order to keep the crosslinking rate per gel particle constant .",
    "the parameters in the potentials and the total volume fraction @xmath35 are the same as in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the differences are that in this earlier work all particles were considered to be gel particles and that the crosslinking was done instantaneously , at @xmath36 , when the particles were on the vertices of a cubic lattice and thus all structural properties were those of percolation in three dimensions .",
    "the present model is similar in some ways to a model discussed by gimel _",
    "_ @xcite and hasmy and jullien @xcite who studied percolation in the context of diffusion - limited cluster - cluster aggregation using monte carlo methods .",
    "their model differs from ours in that it is a lattice model , in the details of the crosslinking process , in the lack of solvent and in the nature of the cluster dynamics . in monte carlo simulations , one is forced to arbitrarily choose the mass - dependent diffusion constant @xmath37 whereas in our molecular dynamics calculations it is determined by the existing structure and the interparticle forces .",
    "in the regime that is of interest here , _",
    "i.e. _ , high enough gel density that percolation is possible , these authors find the critical behavior of ordinary percolation .    in a separate set of runs ,",
    "we calculate the stress - stress autocorrelation function and , through the appropriate green - kubo formula , the shear viscosity .",
    "equilibration and crosslinking are carried out as described above and the calculation of the viscosity is again done with conservative md .",
    "the adjustable parameters in our calculations are the gel fraction @xmath8 , the crosslink density @xmath1 and the system size . here",
    "we report results for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "calculations for other values of @xmath8 are in progress and will be reported in a future publication @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the size of our system in terms of the dimensionless length @xmath41 where @xmath22 is the total number of gel and solvent particles . because the crosslinking process is itself quite time consuming , we are able only to simulate systems up to size @xmath42 ( 32768 particles ) and this makes our estimates of critical exponents rather imprecise . a second factor contributing to the uncertainty in critical exponents",
    "is that we need to determine the critical crosslink density @xmath2 for each value of @xmath8 whereas for lattice percolation this number is known to high accuracy .",
    "we next discuss the static ( geometric ) properties of our model .",
    "the critical concentration @xmath2 at which percolation occurs in the thermodynamic limit @xmath43 is accurately estimated from the intersection of curves @xmath44 as function of @xmath1 for different values of @xmath45 .",
    "here @xmath44 is the fraction of samples percolating in a system of size @xmath45 at crosslink concentration @xmath1 .",
    "for the two cases of interest here , @xmath46 and @xmath38 , we find @xmath47 and @xmath48 . once @xmath2 has been determined , the correlation length exponent @xmath20 can be estimated from the collapse of the data for the function @xmath0 when plotted as function of @xmath49 .",
    "we show this collapse of the data for @xmath38 and @xmath39 in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) . for @xmath46 , the best collapse of the data for @xmath50",
    "is obtained for @xmath51 which should be compared to the three - dimensional percolation result @xmath52 . for @xmath38 ,",
    "finite - size effects are more pronounced and the data for @xmath53 have been excluded . for this case ,",
    "the best collapse of the data is obtained for @xmath54 .",
    "this method of estimating a critical exponent is not very accurate but the three - dimensional percolation value @xmath52 provides a significantly worse collapse of the data .",
    "we next discuss the mean size of finite clusters because this data provides an unbiased estimate of the ratio @xmath55 . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "@xmath10 with @xmath56 for @xmath19 percolation",
    ". for finite @xmath45 , @xmath57 is peaked near @xmath2 with a peak height that grows as @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , rescaling the peak heights to the same value for different @xmath45 provides an estimate of @xmath55 that is not affected by errors in either @xmath2 or @xmath20 . of course , the overall collapse of the data to a universal curve depends on accurate determination of these two quantities but the peak height does not . in figures ( [ fig2 ] ) and ( [ fig3 ] )",
    "we show the function @xmath59 plotted as function of @xmath60 for the previously determined values of @xmath2 and @xmath20 .",
    "the collapse to a universal curve is quite respectable for both @xmath46 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "as above , the data for @xmath53 have been excluded for @xmath38 .",
    "we note that in the case of three - dimensional percolation the ratio @xmath64 .",
    "use of this value of @xmath55 in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) would result in a 40% difference between the peak heights for @xmath42 and @xmath53 .    in the scaling theory of percolation @xcite , the ratio @xmath65 , where @xmath19 is the dimensionality and @xmath66 is the exponent characterising the cluster size distribution at @xmath67 .",
    "if we enforce this scaling relation , we obtain @xmath68 for both @xmath38 and @xmath46 .",
    "using @xmath69 , we find @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "using @xmath72 for the fractal dimension results in the prediction @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the fractal dimensions of the clusters .",
    "as well , the hyperscaling relation @xmath75 yields @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath46 and @xmath61 respectively . the accuracy of these scaling predictions is tested in figures ( [ fig4 ] ) to ( [ fig7 ] ) .    in figure ( [ fig4 ] )",
    "we show the number of clusters @xmath78 of mass @xmath13 at @xmath79 for @xmath38 and 0.3 for @xmath42 and @xmath80 . for the case @xmath81",
    ", we have only counted the uncrosslinked gel particles . in neither case",
    "is the data well described by a simple power law , in contrast to percolation on a lattice or in the absence of solvent where the exponent @xmath16 is already obtained for @xmath82 .",
    "a fit to a power law over the range @xmath83 yields @xmath84 for @xmath38 and @xmath85 for @xmath46 .",
    "the straight lines in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) are the best fits to the form @xmath86 over the range @xmath83 and while the fit is not perfect , the data are not inconsistent with this behavior in the limit of large @xmath13 .    in figure ( [ fig5 ] )",
    "we show the square of the radius of gyration @xmath87 as function of @xmath13 for a system of size @xmath42 together with curves @xmath88 with @xmath74 and @xmath73 as determined above .",
    "the data again show considerable curvature but the fit to the assumed functional form is reasonable over the range @xmath89 .    finally , in figures ( [ fig6 ] ) and ( [ fig7 ] ) we display the scaled form of @xmath90 , the probability that a gel particle is part of the percolating cluster using the predicted exponent ratios @xmath76 for @xmath46 and @xmath91 for @xmath38",
    ". these two figures present the least impressive collapse of data to a universal curve , especially at the larger values of @xmath92 .",
    "one can improve the collapse by different choice of @xmath93 and @xmath20 but at the expense of violating hyperscaling .",
    "we also note that the data for the two largest values of @xmath45 are reasonably close to each other over the entire range of @xmath94 .",
    "we have also carried out a limited number of simulations for @xmath95 and @xmath96 with the crosslinking process described above . in both cases , the critical exponents and the cluster size distributions are entirely consistent with ordinary three - dimensional percolation .",
    "this suggests that either there is a critical gel fraction @xcite below which the geometric properties of the clusters are described by continuously varying exponents or that the apparent variation of the exponents with @xmath8 described above is a finite - size artefact .",
    "only simulations of larger systems can resolve this issue .",
    "we have calculated the shear viscosity for systems up to size @xmath97 as function of the crosslink density @xmath1 for @xmath46 and for @xmath98 for @xmath38 .",
    "systems are equilibrated as a liquid , crosslinked as described above and then evolved by constant energy md for 40000 or 80000 time steps , depending on the crosslink density . here",
    "we have typically used 500 to 2000 different realizations of the crosslinks at each @xmath1 .",
    "we calculate , as in @xcite , the stress - stress autocorrelation function @xmath99 where @xmath100 are elements of the stress tensor . here",
    "the sum is over both gel and solvent particles and @xmath101 is the derivative of the pair potential between particles @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the analysis of the stress - stress correlation function has been described in @xcite and is done in the same way here . as @xmath104 , @xmath105 decays extremely slowly and is fitted , at long times , to a stretched exponential .",
    "the static shear viscosity is then obtained from the appropriate green - kubo formula @xcite , @xmath106 the results , for @xmath46 are shown in finite - size scaled form in fig .",
    "( [ fig8 ] ) where @xmath107 is plotted as function of the scaled concentration @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our previous result for @xmath108 and instantaneous crosslinking where we found @xmath6 , we find that @xmath109 provides an excellent collapse of the data with @xmath51 .",
    "we note that , outside the critical region , consistency of the finite - size scaling ansatz requires the scaled viscosity to vary as @xmath110 and it is clear that the data are consistent with this behavior .",
    "we have also calculated the shear viscosity for @xmath38 for @xmath98 .",
    "the raw data are displayed in figure ( [ fig9 ] ) as function of @xmath111 together with the corresponding results for @xmath46 .",
    "fitting to a power law outside the critical region produces an exponent @xmath112 suggesting , as in the case of the static properties , a variation of critical exponents with @xmath8 and an absence of universality .",
    "in this article we have proposed and investigated a new model for gelation which incorporates a solvent on a microscopic level .",
    "for relatively small concentrations of gel , the geometric properties of the system close to the gel point seem to depend continuously on this gel fraction and are , at least for the system sizes investigated , markedly different from three - dimensional percolation .",
    "in particular , the fractal dimension of the clusters seems to be smaller than those of percolation clusters and this more spidery morphology may be responsible for the slower divergence of the shear viscosity as the gel point is approached .",
    "the change in the exponents controlling the geometric properties is rather small and further study of larger systems is certainly necessary to confirm this result .",
    "however , the exponent @xmath4 that characterizes the divergence of the shear viscosity at the gel point is reduced by almost a factor of 2 from its value in the absence of solvent and it is unlikely that this can be attributed to finite - size effects . in light of this result , it seems implausible that a single universality class describes the behavior of transport coefficients and , presumably , the moduli of the amorphous phase near the gel point . the considerable dispersion found in experimental values of the critical exponents @xcite is another indicator that this may be the case .    in future work",
    "we intend to explore this new model in greater detail . it will be interesting to investigate if the exponent @xmath4 and the static exponents are tunable by varying the concentration of the solvent and the solubility of the solute .",
    "we also intend to study diffusion constants as function of cluster size and to investigate the existence of long time tails .",
    "finally , one of the original motivations for this model is the existence of a body of experimental work that has yielded values in the range 1.1  1.3 for the viscosity exponent @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , we have moved further from this range of values compared to our previous results .",
    "if the cluster size distribution and cluster geometry is the determining factor in the critical behavior of the transport coefficients then this indicates that models that produce more compact rather than more tenuous clusters than those arising from percolation may be appropriate .",
