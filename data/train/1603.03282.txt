    "topological phases of matters have attracted a lot of attention in recent years due to discovery of graphene @xcite and topological insulators @xcite .",
    "also , the search for conventional and unconventional topological superconductors , hosting topological phases @xcite , has become one of the growing topics in condensed - matter physics @xcite . as long as underlying symmetries in the topological systems",
    "are preserved , the symmetry protected gapless edge or surface states within gapped bulk states are robust against many forms of perturbations , making relevant requirement for quantum electronic devices and , especially , topological quantum computations @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) heterostructures @xcite consisting of ingredients such as superconductors , topological insulators , spin - orbit coupled semiconductors and ferromagnets can support topologically nontrivial phases hosting , for instance , non - abelian majorana bound states at zero energy levels @xcite and fractionally charged fermion bound states @xcite . furthermore",
    ", 1d majorana chain has been proposed to include majorana fermions @xcite at its boundaries .",
    "in contrast , one of the simplest 1d topological insulators is known as the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model with the bdi symmetry class which is proposed for polyacetylene @xcite .",
    "ssh model has been shown to exhibit a diversity of nontrivial topological phases @xcite . in this context ,",
    "most of the recent studies have been devoted to investigating the effects of complex boundary potentials @xcite , next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xcite , superconducting correlations @xcite , disorders @xcite , time - dependent potential @xcite , magnetic flux @xcite , modulated on - site potentials @xcite , and hopping amplitudes @xcite on topological properties of the 1d topological insulators .    in theoretical and experimental studies ,",
    "both magnetic field @xcite and spin - orbit coupling @xcite are important keys for the existence of nontrivial phases .",
    "it has been recently shown that a spatially varying magnetic field can be served as an effective spin - orbit interaction leading to creating flat bands of majorana states @xcite and fractionalization of charged bound states @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied the effect of modulated spin - orbit coupling @xcite on trivial and nontrivial regimes of ssh model @xcite . however , the interplay effect of zeeman fields and spin - orbit coupling on topological properties of 1d superlattices @xcite and , in particular , ssh model has received only limited attention",
    ".    in experimentally realizable cases , fine - tuning of parameters of a system to certain values through external fields is not easily reachable , particularly , when dealing with nontrivial topological phases in meso- and nanoscopic platforms @xcite .",
    "so , it is important to provide a much wider range of required model parameters into reach that facilitates experimental observations of desired phases . generally speaking ,",
    "flexibility in increasing or decreasing the range of less important nontrivial or trivial topological phases in favour of a desired topological phase is practically one of the most important requirements of topological quantum computations such that the topological class of the system remains intact .",
    "therefore , an interesting question is how to increase the nontrivial topological region of 1d dimerized lattice in space of parameters with the combined effects of spin - orbit coupling and zeeman field respecting underlying symmetries .    in this work",
    ", we analyze the effect of perpendicular and parallel zeeman fields on topological phases of a ssh chain with modulated spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "if the zeeman fields are absent , trivial regions , where the system is an ordinary insulator , can be found in weak and strong modulated spin - orbit coupling regimes .",
    "furthermore , there exist two types of topologically nontrivial phases characterized by one or two pairs of zero - energy edge states .",
    "we show that in the presence of uniform ( staggered ) perpendicular zeeman field for weak ( strong ) modulated spin - orbit coupling , the trivial region would be turned into a nontrivial topological one through a topological phase transition by increasing the magnitude of the zeeman field that results in the emergence of a pair of zero - energy edge states",
    ". moreover , the perpendicularly applied uniform ( staggered ) zeeman field in the weak ( strong ) modulated spin - orbit coupling regime causes the nontrivial topological phase with two pairs of zero - energy edge states to change its topology and turn into the topologically nontrivial phase hosting one pair of zero - energy states .",
    "symmetry arguments show that the system in the presence of such perpendicular zeeman fields possesses inversion , chiral , particle - hole and effective time - reversal symmetries which still falls in the bdi class with topological number @xmath1 .",
    "we also calculate analytically the winding number through bulk properties of quantum states and show that the results of periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) are in good agreement with those of open boundary conditions ( obcs ) , according to bulk - edge correspondence .",
    "further , we explore the robustness of the symmetry protected edge states by adding local perturbations such as parallel zeeman field and spin - dependent on - site potential .",
    "these perturbations break the symmetries implying that the nontrivial topological phases are protected by inversion symmetry fundamentally .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ section1 ] , we introduce a tight - binding model of the system , and obtain bulk energy bands .",
    "we also investigate symmetries of the system . in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , topological phase diagrams without the zeeman fields are studied . in secs .",

    "we shall later investigate the effect of the zeeman field in the @xmath2-direction , therefore we include the zeeman field as @xmath26 .",

    "i.e. _ , relation ( [ weakspin - orbit ] ) ( ( [ strongspin - orbit ] ) ) as the weak ( strong ) modulated spin - orbit coupling case .",

    "subsequently , one may anticipate that uniform and staggered zeeman fields not only satisfy the energy gap closing conditions , [ see eqs.([gap closure k=0 ] ) and ( [ gap closure k = pi ] ) ] but also preserve some symmetries of the system which will be discussed below .",
    "the system shows particle - hole and chiral symmetries defined respectively as @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 being the identity matrix , the complex conjugation , and the @xmath2-component of the pauli vector @xmath62 , respectively . also , @xmath63 is the @xmath64-component of the pauli vector @xmath65 acting on sublattice space . because of the fact that @xmath66 , the anti - unitary effective time - reversal operator can be determined as @xmath67 .",

    ", there is no kramer s degeneracy related to effective time - reversal symmetry .",
    "therefore , according to the standard altland - zirnbauer classification @xcite , the symmetry class is bdi in the presence of either uniform , @xmath71 , or staggered , @xmath72 , zeeman field .",

    "imply that topological index is @xmath1 .",
    "in order to understand the effect of the perpendicular zeeman fields on the topological properties of the system , the topological phase diagram in the absence of such fields is first investigated by calculating topological invariant @xcite numerically .",

    "[ fig2](a ) , there are three trivial regions , @xmath101 . while one of them is located in the weak modulated spin - orbit regime , the others are in the the strong modulated spin - orbit regime .",

    "we consider the @xmath23-components of zeeman field terms on sublattices @xmath3 and @xmath4 which vary cyclically with the parameter @xmath106 as , @xmath107 where the amplitude @xmath108 and phase factor @xmath109 are parameters to control the strength and sign of the zeeman field on sublattice @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , respectively . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath110 . also , we take @xmath111 and @xmath112 or @xmath113 with @xmath114 an integer , as required by the inversion symmetry .    as discussed already above , when @xmath95 , in the absence of zeeman fields , the system is always gapped and subsequently , a trivial insulator in the weak modulated spin - orbit coupling regime .",

    "equal strengths of inter- and intra cell spin - orbit couplings with almost large magnitudes cause that the band structure around the fermi surface can be affected slightly by small or mediate zeeman field strengths without losing its topological features .",

    "now , let us discuss the stability of the topological phase by considering local perturbations which remove the symmetries of the system . in the nontrivial topological region , in addition to either uniform or staggered @xmath23-component of zeeman field ,",
    "if we introduce the zeeman field along the @xmath2-axis with the same direction and strength on the sublattices , @xmath165 , then the topological phases fall to the ai class .",
    "this is because of breaking of chiral and particle - hole symmetries and preserving of effective time - reversal symmetry .",
    "subsequently , the mid - gap edge states under obcs are no longer stable and shift away from zero energy value as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) .",
    "moreover , in the absence of @xmath23-component of zeeman field , the uniform zeeman field along the @xmath2-direction causes the chain to be a nontrivial insulator with zak phase @xmath166 only in the mixed regime under the conditions    @xmath167    as discussed in the previous secs .",
    "[ section3 ] and [ section4 ] , the system is an ordinary insulator in the presence of uniform ( staggered ) zeeman field along the @xmath23-axis in the weak ( strong ) spin - orbit coupling regime within the range @xmath168 .",
    "interestingly , in this range , we can close and reopen the energy gap to change the topology of the system with the aid of @xmath2-component of uniform zeeman field .",
    "the energy gap closure happens in the presence of uniform zeeman field along the @xmath2-axis and @xmath23-component of staggered zeeman field with conditions @xmath169 hence , the chain is nontrivial insulator @xmath103 within the range @xmath170 . in fig .",
    "[ fig10](b ) the energy spectrum is plotted versus @xmath171 for @xmath165 and @xmath172 . at @xmath173 ,",
    "the chain is an ordinary insulator .",
    "as we increase @xmath171 , the gap closes at @xmath174 and low energy states merge together .",
    "if the @xmath2-component of zeeman field exceeds the certain value @xmath175 , the bulk states join to the mid - gap states and then gap reopens .",
    "similarly , the energy gap closure conditions in the presence of @xmath2- and @xmath23-component of uniform zeeman fields take place at @xmath176 the chain has a nontrivial topology with the condition @xmath177 . for this case , the energy spectrum is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig10](c ) which exhibits a nontrivial phase in the parameter space @xmath178 .",
    "notice that for zero value of the @xmath2-component of zeeman field , the relations ( [ x1 ] ) and ( [ x2 ] ) reduce to the ones presented in eqs .",
    "( [ gap closure k=0 ] ) and ( [ gap closure k = pi ] ) .    in order to investigate the effect of effective time - reversal symmetry on the stability of the edge states , we add the following perturbation to the total hamiltonian @xmath179 where @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) is the strength of on - site potential .",
    "this perturbation breaks not only both particle - hole and chiral symmetries but also effective time - reversal symmetry . as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10](d ) the @xmath2- and @xmath23-component of zeeman fields with perturbation @xmath182 preserve the mid - gap edge states but shift them away from zero energy . in this case ,",
    "due to absence of effective time - reversal , chiral and particle - hole symmetries , the topological class is the a. + remarkably , it is easy to obtain that nonuniform zeeman field along the @xmath2-axis , @xmath183 , breaks the inversion symmetry even in the presence of either uniform or staggered perpendicular zeeman field . in fig . [ fig10](e)((f ) ) , the energy spectrum ( zak phase ) is depicted versus @xmath171 for different magnitudes of @xmath2-component of zeeman fields on each sublattice , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath184 . in this case",
    ", the edge states separate from each other and , subsequently , the zak phase does not have quantized values .",
    "therefore , the above inspections insure that the topological edge states in the studied system , belonging to the bdi , ai , and a classes , are protected by the inversion symmetry .",
    "we have investigated the mutual effects of zeeman field and modulated spin - orbit coupling on the topological characteristics of 1d dimerized lattice .",
    "it is shown that 1d lattice dimerization is a trivial insulator in different parameter regions of weak and strong modulated spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we have also showed that with the aid of uniform perpendicular zeeman field for weak modulated spin - orbit coupling and staggered perpendicular zeeman field for strong modulated spin - orbit coupling , the trivial phases change to a nontrivial topological phase with a topological phase transition .",
    "therefore , as compared with the bare ssh model , the region of nontrivial topological phase in the parameter space can be extended by adding the modulated spin - orbit coupling and the perpendicular zeeman field to the ssh model .",
    "this nontrivial topological phase exhibits one pair of zero - energy edge states obeying non - abelian statistics that is a key requirement in topological quantum computing .",
    "the topological phases of the system are classified with @xmath0 number and belongs to the bdi class .",
    "we also have derived an analytical formula for the winding number through bulk quantum states to confirm our numerical results .",
    "finally , the stability of the edge states to externally applied zeeman field along the chain and on - site spin - dependent potential has also been investigated .",
    "the inclusion of these effects breaks chiral , particle - hole , effective time - reversal , and inversion symmetries resulting in that the edge states are topologically protected and robust against the perturbations as long as the inversion symmetry requirement is satisfied .",
    "we remark that the discussion presented here is an example of the general issue implying that required experimentally accessible regions in parameter space may be engineered , in order to reach desired phases efficiently .",
