    "the problem of solar coronal heating has provided a major challenge since the discovery of the hot corona in 1940s .",
    "the solution remains elusive , in spite of major advances in theoretical modelling and observational capabilities in recent years .",
    "for an overview of our current understanding of this problem , the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "active regions are the brightest long - lived regions on the sun and present an ideal target of opportunity for studing the coronal heating problem .",
    "active regions are comprised of a diffuse component @xcite and a variety of observationally discrete structures , including fan loops , warm loops , and hot core loops .",
    "the fan loops ( only the legs are visible ) are large structures at the edges of active regions , which are characterised by cool emission ( @xmath41mk ) , the warm loops are clearly defined at around 1mk , for example in transition region and coronal explorer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* trace ) , 173   images ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the hot loops are seen in higher temperatures emission ( 3mk ) for example in x - rays ( with hinode / xrt and yohkoh / sxt ) . the moss emission , also clearly seen in trace  173   , is believed to be the footpoints of the hot core loops ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "one of the main concerns regarding the coronal heating problem is whether all the different structures are heated via the same mechanism or whether there are different processes at work for different structures .",
    "the observed properties of warm loops appear to be consistent with models of _ multi - stranded loops _ heated by low - frequency nanoflares ( nanoflares with repetition time lags longer than a cooling time on each strand ) .",
    "however , the results for the hot core loops have not converged .",
    "there is compelling observational evidence for both steady heating ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as impulsive heating @xcite .",
    "since it is not easy to observe the hot core loops directly , due to their inherent fuzzy nature @xcite , authors have focussed on studying the characteristics and dynamics of the moss regions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the moss regions provide important constraints on the heating of the hot core loops ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the main arguments for steady heating is the minimal variability observed in the brightness of the moss emission @xcite , doppler shifts , line widths @xcite and electron density & temperature structure @xcite .",
    "however , we have argued that this can be uniquely interpreted only if the plasma does not have unresolved structures @xcite .",
    "one of the main hindrances to solving the coronal heating problem is that we are still far from resolving the fundamental structures in the solar corona ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the observationally derived properties of coronal structures relate to an ensemble of structures , rather than a fundamental structure itself .",
    "this could have severe consequences for the interpretation of the data .",
    "for example any small scale variations taking place in the fundamental structures could be completely washed out / averaged in our present day observations .",
    "therefore , we have to rely on the diagnostic techniques which do not require the fundamental structures to be resolved .",
    "there are two main diagnostic methods for this purpose , the first being the emission measure ( em ) distribution and the second being the doppler shift of the plasma in the coronal structures . a third method involving time - lag analysis",
    "has recently been developed @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have made use of the doppler shift techniques and studied the bulk flow of plasma in the moss regions , as advocated by @xcite .",
    "this is potentially a powerful diagnostic tool to distinguish between steady heating and impulsive heating models .",
    "models advocating steady heating in symmetric loops predict no doppler shift because the loops are in a static equilibrium where heating , radiation , and thermal conduction are perfectly balanced .",
    "asymmetries in the heating and/or cross sectional area will generate steady flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these flows will be slow unless the asymmetries are extreme @xcite . furthermore , the flows are end - to - end and produce blue shifts in one leg and red shifts in the other .",
    "flows can also be generated in symmetric loops if the heating is very highly concentrated at the loop footpoints ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these flows occur because of thermal nonequilibrium and are time - dependent even though the heating is steady .",
    "impulsive heating produces a very different doppler shift signature .",
    "the standard picture envisions a collection of unresolved strands that are heating quasi - randomly by nanoflares ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an observed emission line then represents the combined emission from many out - of - phase strands .",
    "upflows are generated by chromospheric evaporation , but these tend to be faint because the evaporation phase is short lived and because the initial densities are low .",
    "downflows associated with the subsequent slow cooling and draining of the evaporated plasma tend to be brighter and therefore to dominate the emission .",
    "the composite line profile is therefore predicted to be a red - shifted core with an enhanced blue wing @xcite .",
    "the doppler shift that would be measured from a gaussian fit will depend on the relative strengths of the upflow and downflow emission .",
    "these change depending on the temperature of the emission line .",
    "one goal of our study is to determine how doppler shift depends on temperature .",
    "constant mass flux at constant pressure implies that @xmath5 . while we expect this relationship to hold on each strand at each moment in time , the relationship between doppler shift and temperature for an unresolved collection of strands is not straightforward .",
    "our preliminary modeling suggests that coronal nanoflares produce red shifts which decrease with temperature and eventually give way to blue shifts in hot lines ( bradshaw and klimchuk , in preparation ) .",
    "the temperature of the transition depends on the strength of the nanoflares .",
    "hansteen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have proposed a different impulsive heating scenario .",
    "they suggest that nanoflares occurring in the upper chromosphere cause material to expand downward and upward away from the locally enhanced pressure .",
    "this produces red shifts in transition region emissions and blue shifts in coronal emissions .",
    "@xcite studied the doppler shift and non - thermal width and their temporal variation in moss regions using the  @xmath6195 line observed by the eis .",
    "they reported a minimal red - shift of about 2 - 3  km  s@xmath2 and almost no variability in doppler shift and non - thermal width with time .",
    "these results led them to conclude that the hot core loops are heated in steady fashion .",
    "however , it is worthwhile mentioning here that the reference wavelength they choose for doppler measurements was averaged over the complete raster .",
    "if the emission outside the core has a non - zero absolute doppler shift , the red shifts reported for the core need to be adjusted up or down .    in the present paper",
    "we have made use of a more reliable method of eis wavelength calibration developed by @xcite .",
    "this is based on deriving velocities using in the quiet sun region of each slit position in the raster .",
    "we consider our method , following that of @xcite to be much more robust than that used by @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ obs ] we describe the observation used in this study ; in section  [ analysis ] we have described the data analysis and results followed in section  [ conc ] by a discussion of results and conclusions .",
    "the extreme - ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( eis ; * ? ? ? * ) onboard hinode observed an active region , _ ar  10978 _ , on 12-dec-2007 ( near the central meridian of the sun ) using the observing sequence _",
    "ar_velocity_map_v2_. this sequence uses the 1  slit with an exposure time of 40  seconds .",
    "the eis raster used in this analysis started at 11:43  ut and was completed at 17:02  ut .",
    "the left image in fig .",
    "[ eit_eis ] displays a full disk image recorded by the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) .",
    "the over - plotted box shows the area which was rastered by eis , for which a spectral image built in  @xmath6195 is shown in the right panel .",
    "this active region raster is ideal for a study of doppler shifts since it is very close to the central meridian and it did not show any flaring / micro - flaring activity during the raster ( as well a few days before and after the time of the observations ) as shown by the goes plots in fig .",
    "the location near the central meridian is important because any small flows , which are in the line - of - sight ( los ) can be detected with higher accuracy .",
    "it should be noted that the quiescence of the active region ensures that our measurements are not affected by any small scale dynamic features , such as micro - flares , occurring in the core of the active region .",
    "the eis study sequence used for this work comprises many different spectral lines .",
    "however , in this work we are only concerned with the doppler shift in the moss regions and the temperature dependence of the doppler shifts , so we have selected the subset of the spectral lines from the study , given in table  [ table ] .",
    "the wavelengths shown in the second column in the table are adopted from @xcite .",
    "additionally , we have only used the spectral lines for our study which are cooler than , since the moss emission above this temperature is highly contaminated with overlying hot core loops , as was shown by @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that since we are only interested in measuring the doppler shift in the core of the active region , we have only used the exposures covering the core of the active region .",
    ".spectral lines used to study the the doppler shift in the moss regions .",
    "the wavelengths shown in the second column are taken from @xcite.[table ] [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have generated intensity and doppler maps of the active region in the spectral lines listed in table  [ table ] . as is well known , there are two instrumental effects with eis , namely the orbital variation of the spacecraft and the tilt of the slits with respect to the detector .",
    "it is very important to allow for these when determining doppler measurements .",
    "whilst the tilt of the slits has been measured using independent observations and can be accounted for uniquely from the observations , removing the orbital variation is a non - trivial and non - unique process .",
    "while deriving the doppler maps , there is one additional very important matter , that of choosing a reference wavelength . in order to measure absolute line - of - sight velocity , we require a reference spectrum where the doppler shift of the line is well known .",
    "neutral or singly ionised photospheric or chromospheric spectral lines can be used to measure the absolute shift , as was demonstrated by @xcite using a rocket based spectrometer with an onboard calibration lamp .",
    "this method is routinely used on solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately this is not possible with the eis spectrum since there are no spectral lines from neutral or singly ionized ions , with the exception of  304 which is problematic .",
    "@xcite developed a method whereby they used line in the quiet sun region to obtain the orbital variation and reference wavelength .",
    "we have also used this method and the  @xmath6186.6 line in the quiet sun to derive the absolute wavelength for other lines .",
    "it is then necessary to establish the doppler shift for the  @xmath6186.6 line in the quiet sun .",
    "@xcite showed that although the ionisation equilibrium calculation suggests that the formation temperature of line is @xmath7 , the structures seen in intensity maps show more resemblance with structures seen at @xmath8 .",
    "this fortuitously matches with line for which absolute shift can be measured using sumer observations .    using sumer measurements of the quiet sun",
    ", @xcite found that line formed at @xmath8 are blue - shifted by 2 - 3  km  @xmath9 . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite found that this line was red - shifted by 5 - 6  km  s@xmath2 . in a recent paper , @xcite showed that the shift was zero at @xmath8 .",
    "however , we note that the velocity given in their plot at @xmath8 is not an observational finding , but comes from three - dimensional mhd simulations by @xcite .",
    "these measurements clearly suggest that there are large uncertainties in absolute velocity measurements at @xmath10 . therefore , although @xcite used the @xcite values in their measurements , we have used zero shift at @xmath8 , consistent with @xcite .",
    "we note here that the  @xmath6186.6 line is blended with  @xmath6186.61 formed at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "while this line may have a significant blend in the core of the active region , it has a negligible contribution when observing in the quiet sun .",
    "therefore , this line can safely be used to derive orbital variation and rest wavelength .",
    "the method used can be briefly described as follows : we first identified the lower part of the raster as quiet sun and binned the data in y - direction by 40 pixels ( figure  [ int_velocity_1 ] ) .",
    "this increases the signal to noise ratio quite significantly .",
    "these bottom 40 pixels have intensities equivalent to the quiet sun intensities derived by @xcite .",
    "we used these binned quiet sun data to get orbital variation of the spacecraft and rest wavelength for line . using the off - limb observations of @xcite , and assuming that the absolute doppler shifts vanish for these off limb locations , we know the rest separation of all the other lines with respect to the  @xmath6186.6 line .",
    "this separation is used to retrieve absolute wavelengths for all the other lines used in this study . using this method",
    ", @xcite found that velocities can be measured with an accuracy of 4@xmath35 km  @xmath9 .",
    "figures  [ int_velocity_1 ] & [ int_velocity_2 ] display intensity and velocity maps for the active region in the chosen spectral lines mentioned in table  [ table ] . the overall intensity structures and doppler shift patterns are similar to those derived by previous authors , i.e. , red - shifted loop structures ( around 1mk ) with blue - shifted hotter regions at the boundary of the active regions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , as also shown by @xcite , the footpoints of the loops are highly red - shifted at transition region temperatures with the magnitude of the flow decreasing with rising temperature ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as can also be seen from the figures , the blue shifts at the boundary of the active region increase with temperature .    as noted out earlier ,  @xmath6186.6 is blended with  @xmath6186.61 which is formed at @xmath11 .",
    "the  @xmath6186.61 line has a constant branching ratio of 0.7 with the  @xmath6193.8 .",
    "therefore , if  @xmath6193.8 is observed in the spectrum , the contribution of  @xmath6186.61 can be estimated .",
    "unfortunately , in this study sequence ,  @xmath6193.8 was not observed .",
    "however , analysing the moss and inter - moss spectra for another active region studied by @xcite and @xcite , we find that the contribution of the  @xmath6186.61 line could be as high as @xmath12% in moss regions and about 50% in the inter - moss regions .",
    "therefore , the intensity map for  @xmath6186.6 shown in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ int_velocity_1 ] may have significant contribution due to  @xmath6186.61 in the core of the active region .",
    "hence , it is plausible to conclude that the red - shifts which are seen corresponding to the line is likely to be over - estimated in the core of the active region . by performing a simple analytical calculation we find that if the peak of  @xmath6186.61 is 20% of that of  @xmath6186.6 , the overestimation in the redshift would be of 3.8  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "however , if the peak of  @xmath6186.61 is 50% of that of  @xmath6186.6 , then the overestimation could be as large as 6.8  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the identification of the moss regions is not uniquely defined .",
    "usually moss regions are visually identified based on the high spatial resolution observations recorded by trace in its 173   band , which is sensitive to and emission at around 1mk .",
    "unfortunately , there were no trace observations for this active region .",
    "although there are eit  171 observations essentially showing the same emission as trace  173 , the spatial resolution is not adequate to identify moss regions unambiguously .",
    "therefore , we have to rely on eis observations .",
    "@xcite identified moss regions using an intensity threshold for the  @xmath6186.8 line intensity , which is sensitive to electron density .",
    "we follow a similar approach .",
    "@xcite studied the density structure in different moss regions and found that the electron densities are greater or equal to 2@xmath1310@xmath14 @xmath15 ( derived using line ratio ) . in this eis study",
    ", we have two density sensitive lines of , namely @xmath6202.04 and @xmath6203.82 , which could be used to derive density map of the active region .",
    "it has been found that the two ccds of eis are not exactly aligned with each other @xcite .",
    "since the lines we have used in this study are all from the sort - wavelength band , this effect does not apply here .",
    "however , due to slight misalignment between the dispersion axis of the grating and the axis of the ccd , the images show small y - offset @xcite .",
    "we have accounted for the y - offset between different lines using standard post processing routines provides in _",

    "[ fe13_dens ] displays the intensity maps obtained in  @xmath6202.04 ( left panel ) and @xmath6203.82 ( middle panel ) and the corresponding density map ( right panel ) derived from the ratio of these lines .",
    "the density maps are derived using the chianti v6.1 @xcite atomic database . as can be seen from the intensity and density maps ,",
    "the moss regions are the densest regions in the map .",
    "however , to uniquely obtain the locations of moss regions , we have used the electron densities in moss regions derived by @xcite to determine a cut - off in electron density . we have displayed the density map with log  n@xmath16  @xmath17  9.3 in fig .",
    "[ fe13_range ] .",
    "we believe that these cut - off values for density uniquely distinguish the moss region from other parts of the active region raster .",
    "we continue to study the doppler shift in those pixels only .",
    "it is important to emphasize that when extending the moss regions identified using densities derived using ratios to other lines , it is very important to account for the y - offset between different lines .",
    "we have allowed for this effect in our analysis .",
    "figure  [ velocity_hist ] displays the histograms of the doppler shift for the pixels with densities with log  n@xmath16  @xmath179.3 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fe13_range ] ) for all the spectral lines listed in table  [ table ] .",
    "as can be very clearly seen , all the histogram plots peak very close to zero on the negative velocity ( blue ) side , with the exception of the line ( which is blended with the line ) .",
    "we note here , however , that if we assume that contribution of is as high as 20% and subtract 4  km  s@xmath2 from the velocity histogram , the histogram will peak at around 5  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this is similar to what is found in , which forms almost at the same temperature to that of , observed in moss regions using sumer spectra ( winebarger et al . in preparation).the velocity distribution for all other lines peaks close to zero .",
    "with increasing temperature , the histogram starts to become asymmetric with more points on the blue side .",
    "table  [ table:2 ] provides the mean , median and standard deviation values of the measured velocity distributions for all the lines in the moss region .",
    "the absolute mean velocities are negative i.e. blue shift , which is increasing with temperature .",
    "we have also computed the second moment of the velocity distribution i.e. standard deviation given in the 5th column of the table .",
    "the standard deviation decreases with temperature .",
    "since the mean and median of the measured velocity distributions were within the systematic errors on the measurements , we wanted to find out how many moss pixels have definite shifts .",
    "for this purpose we computed the fraction of pixels with velocity amplitudes greater than the 5  km  s@xmath2 uncertainty ( shown in the 2nd to last column of the table  [ table:2 ] ) .",
    "we can also take the highly conservative view that the absolute velocity calibration is unknown . in that case , the fraction of pixels that deviate from the mean by more than the 5  km  s@xmath2 uncertainty ( last column in the table ) is the smallest possible fraction of pixels that must have a non - zero doppler shift .",
    "the subscript i represents the moss pixels .",
    "both of these measures indicate that a sizable fraction of moss pixels ( @xmath18 for ) can not be at rest .",

    "due to this effect , the intensity and corresponding velocity signatures may be shifted by 1  pixel when there is a sharp change in intensity .",
