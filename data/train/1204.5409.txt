    "the investigation of interacting bosons in the presence of randomness ( the so - called _ dirty - boson _ problem ) represents a long - standing subject in quantum condensed matter , and in particular a subject which remains far from being settled .",
    "indeed disorder has a tremendous impact on the physics of bosons , introducing a significant richness in their phase diagram both at zero and at finite temperature .",
    "intense experimental investigations on a wide variety of different physical systems  including @xmath6he in porous media @xcite , cold atoms in disordered optical potentials @xcite , and doped antiferromagnetic insulators @xcite , among others  have been pursued in the attempt to unveil the universal aspects of such a phase diagram .",
    "a similarly intense activity has been conducted at the theoretical level @xcite , using a variety of methods ranging from field theory to quantum monte carlo . yet , despite more than two decades of intense investigation , fundamental aspects of the physics of dirty bosons remain obscure . among the most salient aspects under debate",
    "are the nature of the non - condensed and non - superfluid state induced by disorder _ and _ interactions in a bose fluid - namely the compressible bose glass or the incompressible mott glass ; and the nature of the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from a bose glass to a strongly interacting superfluid bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , induced by increasing the role of interactions while keeping the disorder strength fixed @xcite .",
    "in particular , the latter transition does not admit a well - controlled analytical treatment , its critical exponents are generally unknown , and the existing predictions @xcite are highly debated @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of the bose - glass / superfluid qpt from the point of view of a model magnet , nicl@xmath7br@xmath84sc(nh@xmath1)@xmath1 ( br - doped dichloro - tetrakis - thiourea - nickel , or br - dtn ) , whose magnetic hamiltonian can be mapped exactly onto that of 3@xmath9 interacting bosons on a lattice with random hopping and random on - site interactions .",
    "a recent experiment @xcite has demonstrated that this compound exhibits an extended magnetic bose - glass phase in an applied magnetic field ",
    "such a phase is characterized by a gapless and magnetically disordered low - temperature state . increasing the field beyond a critical",
    "value drives the system through a qpt from bose glass to magnetic bec , characterized by spontaneous long - range antiferromagnetism in the plane transverse to the field .",
    "in particular the critical temperature to condensation is shown to scale with the applied field as @xmath10 with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 represents the dimensionless magnetic field and @xmath13 its critical value .",
    "a seemingly puzzling feature is that the only theoretical prediction for the @xmath14 exponent , stemming from ref .  , gives @xmath15 , in open contradiction with the result of ref .  . using quantum monte carlo simulations of the model hamiltonian for br - dtn , as well as of the hamiltonian of dtn with a diluted magnetic lattice",
    ", we provide a detailed investigation of the quantum critical scaling at the bose - glass / superfluid transition . in the case of br - dtn",
    "we also investigate the low - temperature specific heat - both numerically and experimentally - and the magnetization - numerically - around the critical field .",
    "our theoretical data for the zero - temperature quantum critical point ( qcp ) support the picture of conventional scaling and the prediction @xcite of @xmath16 for the dynamical critical exponent .",
    "nonetheless the results for the behavior of the system at finite temperature are seen to be globally incompatible with the predictions stemming from the scaling ansatz of ref .   for the free energy , which assumes that the temperature is the only direction of instability of the qcp , while disorder and interactions can be eliminated from the scaling .",
    "we discuss possible violations of conventional scaling , due to the presence of a dangerously irrelevant operator , and find that a fully consistent picture can only be obtained when assuming that such an operator affects the finite - temperature behavior only , preserving conventional scaling at @xmath17 . in the absence of a consistent theoretical treatment of the long - wavelength behavior of dirty bosons @xcite , our results offer a first , empirical determination of the scaling behavior around the dirty - boson qcp .",

    "[ s.conclusions ] .",
    "in the absence of disorder , the physics of interacting bosons is generally well understood following a set of established paradigms .",
    "a diluted bose gas of weakly interacting bosons undergoes condensation in a spatially extended state , and it is quantitatively described by bogolyubov and beliaev theory @xcite .",
    "the qpt from the vacuum state into the condensed state , driven by the chemical potential , represents a gaussian transition in dimensions @xmath18 with dynamical critical exponent @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite in @xmath20 the onset of the critical temperature to condensation around the qcp follows the power - law scaling @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the critical chemical potential ) , with @xmath23 as predicted by mean - field theory @xcite . for bosons on a lattice ,",
    "an instability to the formation of a mott - insulating state occurs for sufficiently large interactions , and the qpt from a superfluid condensate to a mott insulator away from commensurate filling admits the same description as the qcp of the diluted bose gas , while it belongs to the universality class of the xy model in @xmath24 dimensions at commensurate filling .",
    "@xcite    the introduction of disorder to the system is accompanied by the anderson localization of the ( low - energy ) single - particle eigenstates ; such states can not host a bose - einstein condensate in the thermodynamic limit in the presence of any finite interaction . as a consequence , the physics of the diluted bose gas",
    "is completely altered by disorder , and a novel phase appears - the bosonic anderson glass or bose glass @xcite - characterized by the redistribution of bosons on an extensive number of low - lying anderson - localized states .",
    "this fact renders the theoretical description of the bose glass quite involved , as conventional tools for the diluted bose gas are no longer available .",
    "this is _ a fortiori _ true when the interaction strength increases ( the disorder strength being held fixed ) , inducing a qpt from the bose glass into a strongly correlated condensed and superfluid state .",
    "this transition , as well as other transitions in disordered systems @xcite , represents an exceptionally hard problem in the theory of critical phenomena .",
    "indeed the upper critical dimension @xmath25 , above which mean - field theory becomes exact , is unknown for dirty bosons ; and perturbative renormalization group treatments break down @xcite , given that they are based on the assumption of a finite @xmath25 , while @xmath25 might as well be infinity for dirty bosons .",
    "this means that a quantitative understanding of the behavior of interactions and disorder under renormalization is still lacking , as well as a rigorously motivated scaling form for the free energy . in the following we will offer evidence that the scaling ansatz for the free energy proposed by ref .   is not appropriate .",
    "another fundamental open question concerns the value of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath2 .",
    "the derivation of the identity @xmath3 offered in ref .   has been questioned in ref .  ,",
    "and some numerical calculations in @xmath26 seem indeed to contradict it @xcite , although other 2@xmath9 studies are instead consistent with it @xcite . for @xmath20",
    "much less results are available , but @xmath27 is consistent with the existing numerical studies of the 3@xmath9 bose - glass / superfluid transition @xcite , and , as we will see , also with the numerical results of this work ( sec .",
    "[ s.zd ] ) .    the derivation of @xmath3 in ref .",
    "is based on the observation that the compressibility @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the free energy density and @xmath30 is the chemical potential ) behaves as the imaginary - time stiffness of the system .",
    "an expansion of the _ singular _ part of the free energy upon an infinitesimal twist leads to the prediction that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the distance to the critical point ; if the compressibility is to remain finite across the transition , this would then imply that @xmath33 .",
    "this derivation has been questioned by ref .",
    ", on the basis that the main response to a twist in imaginary time is expected to come from the _ analytical _ rather than from the singular part of the free energy ",
    "this is due to the fact that , if the particle - hole symmetry is already broken ( as it is across the generic bose - glass / superfluid transition ) , a variation in the chemical potential does not alter the hamiltonian symmetries in the system , and hence it should lead to negligible contributions in the singular part of the free energy density .",
    "therefore the finiteness of @xmath34 across the transition should not have any obvious implication for the critical exponents .",
    "it is generally hard to believe as an accident that many numerical results appear to be consistent with @xmath3 - although , as noticed in ref .  , only in a few cases",
    "an unbiased estimate of @xmath2 has been provided . without the pretension of solving the issue of the value of @xmath2 , in the following we provide a simple derivation of the finite - size scaling for the compressibility at zero temperature , based on its relationship with the particle - hole gap .",
    "indicating with @xmath35 the ground - state energy of the system having @xmath36 particles , we have that the particle - hole gap takes the form @xmath37 for an hypercubic system of size @xmath38 , taking the limit @xmath39 one obtains @xmath40 where we have used the fact that @xmath41 , and the definition of the compressibility @xmath42 . at the qcp ,",
    "the finite - size particle - hole gap must vanish as @xmath43 , yielding the result @xmath44 .",
    "hence a finite compressibility in the thermodynamic limit at the qcp would require that @xmath3 .",
    "the above derivation is based on the only assumption that conventional scaling applies ( giving @xmath43 ) , namely that the system is below or at the upper critical dimension .",
    "the scaling of @xmath34 is indeed observed at the commensurate - incommensurate transition of the bose - hubbard model with @xmath19 both in @xmath45 ( where the compressibility diverges @xcite ) and in @xmath26 ( where the compressibility jumps @xcite , up to logarithmic corrections ) .",
    "it is also verified at the mott - insulator / superfluid transition at commensurability ( with @xmath46 ) , _",
    "e.g. _ in @xmath45 ( compressibility jump at the kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite ) and in @xmath47 ( where the compressibility vanishes continuously @xcite ) .",
    "recently a new experimental playground has become available for the study of the physics of dirty bosons : doped magnetic insulators . in such systems a bose fluid of magnetic quasiparticles ( corresponding to modes carrying a spin @xmath48 ) can be controlled by the application of a magnetic field , and can be made to condense at sufficiently low temperature when the field exceeds a critical value @xcite .",
    "the condensed phase corresponds to long - range ( anti)ferromagnetism in the plane transverse to the field .",
    "static doping of the magnetic insulator leads to disorder in the magnetic hamiltonian , and allows therefore to investigate a field - induced bose - glass / superfluid transition , which has been discussed theoretically @xcite as well as recently probed in experiments @xcite .    here",
    "we focus our attention on br - doped dtn , which has been recently investigated in ref .  .",

    "@xmath58 k , @xmath59 k , @xmath60 k and @xmath61 .",
    "@xcite the effect of br doping on the magnetic behavior can be quantitatively captured by promoting the @xmath53 couplings and the single - ion anisotropies to local , bond - dependent ( @xmath62 ) and site - dependent ( @xmath63 ) quantities , related to the appearance of a br dopant on the cl - cl bond bridging the antiferromagnetic interactions between ni ions along the @xmath54 axis . in particular a concentration @xmath64 of br dopants leads to a fraction @xmath65 of doped cl - br bonds ( neglecting the case of rare br - br bonds for @xmath66 ) ; br doping is modeled as increasing the @xmath53 bond strength to @xmath67 , and reducing the single anisotropy @xmath57 to @xmath68 on one of the two ions connected by the bond . in the rest of this paper",
    "we will focus on the doping value @xmath69 .      to probe the universal character of some of our findings , we consider as well the case of site dilution of the magnetic lattice of dtn , leading to the following model hamiltonian @xmath81 the hamiltonian parameters are now set to be homogeneous and equal to those of pure dtn , but the random variables @xmath82 have been introduced , taking the value 0 with probability @xmath64 and 1 with probability @xmath83 . here @xmath64 is the lattice dilution .",

    "similarly to the case of br - dtn , a spin - boson transformation maps the spin hamiltonian eq .   to that of a lattice gas of strongly interacting bosons hopping on a spatially anisotropic cubic lattice with site dilution .    in the following",

    "the onset of a finite - temperature transition at @xmath100 starting from the qcps at @xmath78 , @xmath80 is a complex problem in the theory of critical phenomena , because the thermal transition and the quantum transition are completely different in nature .",
    "a comprehensive treatment of the two can be attempted via the crossover scaling theory of phase transitions @xcite , which can account for the crossover between the quantum critical behavior at low and zero temperature and in the vicinity of the qcp , and the classical critical behavior close to the line of critical temperatures @xmath100 ( see fig .",

    "is only guaranteed to work in the ginzburg region @xcite , but one can test the consequences of its extension to a broader range of validity , including the quantum critical trajectory , as done in ref .  .",
    "using hyperscaling at both the classical and quantum phase transition , this leads to the predictions @xmath272 and @xmath273 where @xmath274 is the critical exponent at the thermal transition .    using @xmath11 , @xmath275 , @xmath3 and @xmath276 for the 3dxy universality class @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath277 and @xmath278 , fully compatible with our numerically and experimentally determined values .",
    "a possible argument can be formulated to justify the apparent success of the above ansatz _",

    "this is not what one would typically expect , given that the classical critical exponents pertain to the ginzburg region , while the quantum critical exponent pertain to the quantum critical fan above the qcp .",
    "the ginzburg region surrounds the classical critical line @xmath279 , while the quantum critical fan is ( loosely ) lower bounded by a crossover line @xmath280 reflecting the typical energy scale of the spectral features which vanish at the qcp . if @xmath169 , as predicted by conventional scaling , eq .",
    ", the two above regions can be well separated ( fig .",
    "[ f.qccartoon](a ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath281 ( as in the dirty - boson case , in which @xmath282 ) the quantum critical regime is not lower - bounded by @xmath283 but rather by @xmath98 , and hence the quantum - critical region and the ginzburg region are completely contiguous , so that one could imagine that the quantum critical trajectory could be influenced by the classical critical behavior ( fig .",
    "[ f.qccartoon](b ) ) .",
    "this very unconventional scenario is purely speculative at this stage , and it will require more investigations @xcite .      to avoid the shortcomings of continentino s scaling - namely the extension to the quantum - critical trajectory of a scaling form expected to be valid close to the classical critical line only - we can propose a further scaling ansatz which generalizes continentino s one while preserving its virtues . indeed eq .  [ e.continentino ] is consistent with the more general , _ two - argument _ scaling ansatz @xmath284 to obtain hyperscaling at @xmath17 , we simply need to assume that @xmath285 const . when @xmath286 and @xmath243 .",
    "we rewrite the above scaling form as @xmath287 where @xmath288 when approaching the qcp at very low temperatures , namely @xmath112 and @xmath289 but @xmath290 ( implying @xmath291 ) .    on the other hand , when approaching the quantum - critical trajectory , @xmath112 , @xmath289 , but @xmath292 ( namely @xmath293 ) , we assume a rather different form for the @xmath294 function , namely @xmath295 when @xmath296 ( @xmath297 and @xmath298 are constants ) @xcite . upon this assumption we readily obtain that , along the quantum - critical trajectory @xmath299 , @xmath243 @xmath300 and @xmath301 the @xmath302 exponent can be determined by eq .  , @xmath303 , using the numerical values of all the other exponents .",
    "hence we can obtain a picture which is globally consistent with all of our results .",
    "we have investigated , both theoretically and experimentally , the field - induced quantum phase transition in the magnetic hamiltonian of dtn in the presence of bond / anisotropy disorder or of site dilution .",
    "this quantum phase transition represents a well controlled realization of the dirty - boson quantum critical point ( qcp ) in three dimensions .",
    "we have provided compelling evidence that conventional scaling is obeyed at the dirty - boson qcp , but that unconventional scaling ( including the possible presence of a dangerously irrelevant operator ) is necessary to account for the thermodynamics along the quantum critical trajectory , as well as for the power - law dependence of the line of critical temperatures on the applied field .",
    "our results are compatible with the prediction @xmath3 , but incompatible with the prediction @xmath169 for the exponent of the power - law scaling of the critical temperature , as also found in recent experiments @xcite . within a generalized",
    "scaling ansatz @xmath14 plays the role of an independent exponent , whose value , combined with that of quantum critical exponents as well as classical critical ones , can be quantitatively related to the exponents governing the power - law scaling of the specific heat and of the magnetization along the quantum critical trajectory .",
    "a recent experiment on piperazinium - cu@xmath1(cl@xmath94br@xmath95)@xmath96 has measured the order - parameter exponent via neutron scattering at low temperature,@xcite giving @xmath304 .",
    "our evidence is that this exponent is not compatible with the dirty - boson universality class in @xmath20 ( see also ref .  )",
    "; more investigations will be necessary in this direction .    while a conclusive picture on the dirty - boson quantum critical point is still far from obvious , our results provide a quantitative scenario which a well - controlled theory of the dirty - boson effective action @xcite should be able to reproduce .",
    "more generally , our results further confirm that disordered quantum magnets represent an invaluable tool for the investigation of complex phenomena of interacting bosons , and that they stand among the best candidate systems to unveil the universal features of dirty bosons .",
