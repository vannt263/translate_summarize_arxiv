    "the dissociative recombination ( dr ) of small molecular ions that collide with electrons plays an important role in interstellar diffuse and dense clouds .",
    "it is well known that these clouds constitute building material for new stars .",
    "the importance of dr cross sections as parameters in star formation models , for such astrophysically relevant ions as h@xmath2 and hco@xmath0 , is one of the reasons why dr has been extensively studied in laboratory experiments @xcite . for diatomic molecules",
    "the process is well understood and described theoretically @xcite . until recently @xcite though , theory was unable to model the dr process in triatomic ions , except in cases where a neutral dissociative state crossed the ionic born - oppenheimer surface in the franck - condon region , generating a rapid rate @xcite . in triatomics ,",
    "a key complication is the fact that multiple vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom must generally be taken into account .  and",
    "in addition to the greater computational burden of treating more dimensions quantum mechanically , the addition of these new degrees of freedom can also lead to new conceptual issues , related to the degeneracy of vibrational or rovibrational levels in certain triatomic ions ( e.g. , in both h@xmath1 and hco@xmath0 ) .",
    "this can cause an intrinsic instability of the corresponding neutral molecules @xcite that causes them to distort away from the symmetric geometry .    consider an incident electron that interacts with a closed - shell triatomic ion having a degenerate vibrational mode .",
    "if the symmetry group @xmath3 of the resulting neutral complex has at least one degenerate irreducible representation , the electronic partial wave components with angular momentum @xmath4 typically contain at least one such representation , whereby the corresponding electronic states of the neutral molecule are degenerate in the clamped - nuclei approximation .",
    "due to the jahn - teller theorem @xcite , first formulated by landau @xcite , this degenerate electronic state strongly interacts with a degenerate vibrational state of the @xmath3 group .",
    "the interaction leads to either a quadratic ( renner - teller ) @xcite or linear conical ( jahn - teller ) intersection , where `` quadratic '' or `` linear '' refers to the dependence of the adiabatic eigenvalues on the symmetry distortion coordinate ; e.g. , the electronically - degenerate linear molecule being considered in the present article displays a quadratic behavior near the symmetry point , as a function of the bending angle @xmath5 . in electron - induced reactions ,",
    "electron capture can be followed by dissociation or autoionization of the recombined system .",
    "( in some rare cases , recombination could also occur radiatively following electron capture , but this is rarely important in molecular systems having an open dissociation channel and it will be ignored throughout this study . )",
    "since the degenerate electronic state causes the instability of the symmetric configuration , the recombined molecule quickly distorts away from the symmetry point to remove the degeneracy , after which the autoionization channel typically becomes energetically closed , and the molecule eventually finds a pathway along which it can dissociate ( provided there is an electronic state of the molecule that is open for dissociation ) . in a system for which no direct crossing of a neutral dissociative state with the ground state of the ion is present , this indirect mechanism can become dominant , and it can still produce large dr cross sections .",
    "this is expected to be particularly true for molecules containing hydrogen .",
    "work by some members of the present collaboration have recently found that this is what happens in h@xmath6 collisions @xcite . for hco@xmath0 , a closed - shell linear ion in its ground state",
    ", the picture appears to be similar .",
    "the lowest doubly - degenerate vibrational @xmath7 states are coupled to the electronic states @xmath8 of the neutral system through the renner - teller interaction , resulting in a large probability for recombination .",
    "although renner - teller coupling is a well - known phenomenon in spectroscopy , the effect of renner - teller coupling on electron - molecule collisions has not been studied until recently .",
    "_ @xcite have made an important contribution to understanding the role of renner - teller physics in collisions between an electron and the co@xmath9 molecule . in a completely @xmath10 @xmath11 treatment",
    ", the authors employed a time - dependent framework to describe the nuclear motion of the negative ion co@xmath12 formed during the collision .",
    "the nuclei move on the two - component @xmath13 and @xmath14 electronic complex potentials corresponding to the doubly - degenerate @xmath15 molecular state at linear configuration .",
    "the two components interact through the renner - teller coupling mechanism .",
    "the aim of the present study is to understand the mechanism of dr in hco@xmath16 and , in particular , to interpret its large measured rate .",
    "this ion was first detected in space and then synthesized in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements of dr in hco@xmath0 were realized in a number of merged - beam , afterglow - plasma , and storage ring experiments @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have presented the potential energy surfaces for the ground molecular state of hco@xmath0 and the lowest states of hco up to principal quantum number @xmath17 , calculated as functions of all three vibrational coordinates .",
    "the potentials were then used to estimate the dr rate .",
    "since the splitting between the two @xmath8 electronic states for the principal quantum number @xmath18 was found to be small , it was suggested that the renner - teller non - born - oppenheimer coupling should not play a significant role in dr of hco@xmath0 , therefore , it was not included in the model of ref .",
    "however , since even a small coupling between degenerate states can in principle result in a large dr probability , we investigate here the role of renner - teller coupling in hco in more detail , and find that we must revise that initial expectation .",
    "the article is organized in the following way . in section [ sec : ham_rt ] we construct the model hamiltonian from the results of the _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "the hamiltonian includes the nonadiabatic renner - teller coupling and depends parametrically on the nuclear configurations .",

    "the two other examples are taken from the region around the left turning point where the velocity of motion could be small or large depending on the energy of the electron . in cases like this one , we calculated the probability @xmath125 for a range of values of the kinetic energy @xmath123 .",
    "there are many such avoided crossings that occur near left turning points and comparatively fewer at right turning points .    during half ( @xmath126 ) of an oscillation period",
    ", the system goes through @xmath127 avoided crossings .",
    "we estimate that @xmath127 is about 10 for a typical resonance curve .",

    "we have assumed that only two states interact at each avoided crossing .",
    "however , in reality many of the avoided crossing can not be considered as strictly two - state ones : three or more states @xmath129 can participate .",

    "the energy of the ground ionic curve @xmath138 was subtracted from all the data . in the figure",

    "the probability to capture the electron tends to be high for such states , diminishing however at high principal quantum numbers as @xmath139 . ]    as one can see , the autoionization probability could be competitive with predissociation in our model if we take the smallest ratio @xmath140 , but it is more likely that the ratio is of the order of 2 - 3 and therefore , more favorable to predissociation . in the previous theoretical study of dr in h@xmath1 @xcite ,",
    "the ratio was significantly larger .",
    "an important difference with the h@xmath141 study is the two degrees of freedom taken into account when adiabatic potentials @xmath142 were calculated . as a result ,",
    "the density of resonance curves was much higher ( factor 20 - 40 ) .",
    "the main contribution to the high density of resonance curves was from the states with small principal quantum number corresponding to highly excited ionic channels .",
    "this increased significantly the probability of predissociation .",
    "in fact , in the case of hco , the vibrating co bond should also increase the density of steep resonance curves in figs .",
    "[ resonances_m1 ] and [ resonances_m1_2 ] .",
    "this is because if the vibration along co is quantized , each of the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ energies ] will produce a series additional ionic curves with different co quanta .",
    "therefore , the number of ionic potential will be larger and , correspondingly , the density of resonance curves and avoided crossings in figs .",
    "[ resonances_m1 ] and [ resonances_m1_2 ] will be increased too .",
    "this should increase the dr cross section ( more states to be captured to ) and the ratio @xmath143 ( more avoided crossings ) .",
    "another approximation is that the @xmath144 rydberg states have dissociative character and are poorly described by this model .",
    "however , we believe that the dominant dr pathways are triggered by an initial capture into higher rydberg states , rather than being directly captured into @xmath144 states .",
    "in the previous theoretical study of dr in hco@xmath105 published by some of us,@xcite the renner - teller coupling was not taken into account because it appeared to have a small effect on the potential surfaces of excited molecular states of the hco molecule .",
    "however , renner - teller coupling involves degenerate @xmath145 states and therefore should play an important role in electron - ion scattering especially when @xmath84 and @xmath85 molecular potentials approach closely to each other .",
    "although renner - teller coupling was not included in the previous study , some nonadiabatic effects were considered there .",
    "the quantum defects @xmath146 for @xmath147 states obtained from _ ab initio _ calculation demonstrate sharp variations at some configurations @xmath148 of the three hco nuclei .",
    "therefore , instead of using the three adiabatic defects @xmath146 , a numerical diabatization procedure was applied to give a @xmath148-dependent 3x3 matrix @xmath149 of quantum defects .",
    "the @xmath148 dependence of the matrix is weaker and the matrix has more information about nonadiabatic effects than the diagonal matrix @xmath146 .",
    "on the other hand the nonadiabatic effects represented by non - diagonal elements of @xmath146 might have a smaller effect on the dynamics of the electron comparing with the nonadiabatic couplings involving degenerate @xmath145 states .",
    "indeed , the dr cross section obtained in the previous study @xcite is much smaller than the cross section of the present treatment . to verify that the increase in the dr cross section is indeed due to the renner - teller coupling",
    ", we artificially set the non - diagonal elements in the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ eq : hint ] to zero and calculated again the cross section for @xmath150 .",
    "the resulting dr cross section is about a factor of three smaller than the cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ cs ] and on average it is close to the result of the previous study .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite accounts for all three vibrational degrees of freedom but the very high vibrational levels that generate the steep rydberg @xmath144 curves in fig .",
    "[ resonances_m1 ] ( which have large widths and therefore lead to an increase in the capture probability ) were omitted ; these two effects would tend to balance each other , and might give roughly the same cross section as in the present study when off - diagonal couplings are switched off .",
    "we speculate that if the co bond vibration was included in the present treatment the effect of the renner - teller effect would likely be even more pronounced . to summarize our discussion of this point",
    ", we conclude that the renner - teller effect appears to be the most important nonadiabatic coupling in the dissociative recombination of hco@xmath105 .",
    "the theoretical cross section obtained in this study is inversely - proportional to the incident energy below @xmath151 ev ( see fig .",
    "[ cs ] ) . above 0.1 ev",
    "the cross section falls more rapidly with increasing energy .",
    "this is caused by the fact that at 0.1 ev an additional ionic channel becomes open .",
    "that ionic channel is responsible for the large probability to capture the electron . above that ionization threshold , the density of rydberg states ( in which capture can occur ) in much lower , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ resonances_m1 ] , and therefore the capture probability drops . moreover , resonance states above that ionization threshold have another competing decay channel for autoionization , which steals flux away from the dr observable . for the ground",
    "vibrational level @xmath152 ( dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ cs ] ) , that additional open channel is @xmath153 , for the first excited level there are two nearby levels : @xmath154 and @xmath155 . a similar behavior of the cross section was observed in dr of h@xmath141 @xcite : the cross section drops down once a new ionic channel becomes open .",
    "the cross section from the previous theoretical study of hco@xmath105 ( the solid line in fig .",
    "[ cs ] ) does not show that behavior .",
    "it behaves smoothly as the energy crosses the new ionization threshold .",
    "this is because the renner - teller effect was not accounted for : hence transitions of the type @xmath156 are forbidden by the different symmetries of those vibrational states .",
    "another difference with the previous study is the manner in which the final cross section is calculated . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the scattering matrix @xmath157 for electron - ion collisions was explicitly calculated , but only in the electron - ion subset of channel space with no channel indices explicitly referring to dissociation .",
    "all of the channels @xmath158 are vibronic states . however , some of the channels @xmath158 are open for dissociation , and as a result , the @xmath157 matrix is not completely unitary .",
    "the defect from unitarity was used to calculate the dissociative flux and the corresponding dr cross section .",
    "the resulting cross section from this method has a rich structure with many rydberg series of resonances .",
    "the cross section was then averaged over an appropriate thermal distribution of electron energies .",
    "the averaged cross section still has a number of resonances that are not seen in the comparatively low resolution experiment . in the present paper",
    "we have employed a different averaging procedure , as was discussed above .",
    "this procedure gives a very smooth curve for the cross section .",
    "in summary , we would like to stress the following :    * we have developed a theoretical approach to obtain the cross section for dissociative recombination of hco@xmath105 .",
    "the approach is based on a model reaction matrix @xmath67 that includes the non - born - oppenheimer renner - teller coupling between doubly - degenerate vibrational modes of hco@xmath105 and the degenerate continuum states of the incident electron .",
    "the structure of the matrix @xmath67 is derived directly from the hamiltonian that accounts for the renner - teller physics , with elements of the constructed @xmath67-matrix , if diagonalized , that reproduce the quantum defects obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations . *",
    "we have shown that even a modest renner - teller splitting can cause a greatly enhanced dr rate .",
    "the previous theory without the renner - teller coupling gave a lower dr cross section .",
    "the present dr cross sections are still generally about a factor of 2 lower than the experimental cross sections . * the vibration along the co bond was not included in the present model .",
    "we believe that the inclusion of the co bond should increase the density of hco states available to be populated during the electron - ion collision .",
    "this will probably increase the dr cross section , but the quantitative amount remains to be determined by future studies .",
    "another error expected to be of order 70% is introduced by our use of an adiabatic approximation in the @xmath25 coordinate , and this should also be improved in future calculations .",
    "* in the present treatment the dissociation occurs predominantly through the indirect pathway , i.e. through rydberg states of hco .",
    "the estimated autoionization probability is comparable with the predissociation probability , but it seems likely that inclusion of co vibrations may increase the probability of predissociation . * the approach is quite general and can be applied to other closed - shell linear molecular ions , such as hcs@xmath105 .",

    "<S> a theoretical description of the dissociative recombination process for the hco@xmath0 ion suggests that the nonadiabatic renner - teller coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is consistent with a recent study of this process for another closed - shell molecule , the h@xmath1 ion , where jahn - teller coupling was shown to generate a relatively high rate . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section obtained here for the dissociative recombination of hco@xmath0 exhibits encouraging agreement with a merged - beam experiment . </S>"
