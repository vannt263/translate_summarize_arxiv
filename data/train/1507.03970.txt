    "in many respects atomtronic devices and circuits  @xcite can be understood using the same framework applicable to their electronic counterparts .",
    "analytical tools such as kirchhoff s voltage and current laws , for example , are simply circuit - relevant statements about energy and particle conservation , which apply equally well to electronic and atomtronic systems . operating in the ultracold regime , two aspects of atomtronic circuits make them both interesting and very different from classical electronics . first , quantum coherence can be long lived compared with other circuit timescales of interest .",
    "second , atomtronic circuits are typically decoupled from a thermal reservoir  @xcite .",
    "an active circuit is by definition a non - thermal - equilibrium dynamical system and any useful circuit will generate heat for both fundamental and technical reasons . in general , this means that the temperature will vary from place - to - place across the circuit .",
    "thermal coupling to the environment enables an electronic circuit to reach thermal steady - state ( not thermal equilibrium ) and finite device temperature .",
    "however , heat has no thermal bath to flow to in an atomtronic circuit .",
    "while doubling its temperature often leads to permanent failure of a nominal room - temperature electronic device , the same is not true of an atomtronic device . yet",
    "such significant changes in temperature can certainly have an impact on the quantum character of devices operating in the ultracold regime .",
    "the interplay between the thermal - statistical and quantum aspects of atomtronic circuits at the physical level is profoundly related to circuit functionality through entropy ",
    "physical entropy on the one hand and information entropy on the other .",
    "for example , if a circuit function corresponds to the lowering of information entropy , as is often the case , this must correspond to a lowering of physical entropy in some region of the circuit , which demands that there is a corresponding increase in entropy in another region of the circuit if the second law of thermodynamics is to be upheld .",
    "electronic circuits are challenging from an analytical standpoint and atomtronic circuits are dramatically more so .",
    "only the most elementary electronic circuits can be treated from first principles ; complex circuits are designed using heuristic principles and analyzed using parameterized device models and highly optimized numerical solvers .",
    "our purpose in this work is to make some headway along these same lines in the atomtronics domain .",
    "we motivate our objective with a few simple questions regarding a conceptually simple system . as it turns out , the questions are very difficult to answer .",
    "consider the double - potential - well system of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .    schematic representation of a bec heating as it comes to thermal equilibrium in a double - well potential .",
    "( a ) initially , the state of the system is highly non - equilibrium as demonstrated by the empty states in the population distribution at energies corresponding to levels in the right - hand well .",
    "( b ) in thermal equilibrium the population has been redistributed via elastic collisions between atoms because population of lower lying states in the right - hand well are always accompanied by population of higher lying states .",
    "the net result is heating of the initial distribution as depicted by the change in color from ( a ) ( blue , colder ) to ( b ) ( red , hotter ) . ]",
    "the right - hand well is initially devoid of atoms while the left - hand well holds a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) at , or very near to , absolute zero .",
    "the bec is characterized by a chemical potential , @xmath0 , while the empty right - hand well has a chemical potential equal to its ground state energy . for this discussion",
    "we take @xmath0 to be large compared to the single - particle energy level spacing near the ground state of the well , but considerably less than the barrier height between the wells .",
    "our first question is :  does this ( isolated ) system come to thermal equilibrium , and , if so , by what route does it do so ? \" by thermal equilibrium we mean the system is described by a single , time - independent temperature , @xmath1 , and chemical potential , @xmath2 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) .",
    "we note that the equilibrium state must have finite temperature to maintain fixed total internal energy , even if the initial left - hand bec is at zero temperature .",
    "thus , by whatever route the system arrives at equilibrium , heating must take place .",
    "the energy associated with the temperature rise comes at the expense of chemical potential , which necessarily decreases from its initial value in the left - hand well . supposing that parameters are chosen such that thermal equilibrium supports a condensate in both wells , then their chemical potentials must be equal in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this implies that their respective wavefunctions have a well - defined relative phase which , ignoring fluctuations , is constant in time .",
    "our second question is :  can the two condensates phase - lock , and if so , under what conditions does this occur ? \" by  phase - lock \" we mean that if the relative phase is perturbed it subsequently returns to a fixed equilibrium value .",
    "phase - locking is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature ( see  @xcite for a number of examples ) , and more to our point , it is an important functional primitive among electronic circuits ",
    "it lies at the heart of every modern radio receiver , for example . in the circuit context , questions regarding thermal equilibrium",
    "can similarly be asked regarding dynamical equilibrium .    to make an attempt at answering both questions in the circuit context",
    ", we developed a model of an atomtronic circuit operating with finite temperature becs in the presence of atomic current flows , which are determined by atom injection and extraction processes , as well as collisions .",
    "the model draws upon a wealth of theoretical developments involving weakly interacting bose gases  @xcite .",
    "past studies of phenomena occurring in multi - well potentials include atom interferometry  @xcite , the bosonic josephson effect  @xcite , dynamical phase - locking of becs  @xcite , and transistor - like behavior of ultracold atoms  @xcite .",
    "they typically involve solutions of the time - independent schrdinger equation , or the more general von neumann equation for the bose - hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite , and treat collision effects at the level of the boltzmann equation  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "detailed analyses were performed , sometimes under restrictive experimental conditions , such as for a microcanonical ensemble with a fixed total number of atoms to isolate the phenomenon of interest in order to understand its underlying physics .",
    "the methods are effective at extracting intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that characterize the gas , such as damping rates for various collective excitations .",
    "these parameters provide good anchors for our model , which is more phenomenologically based for two reasons .",
    "first , the number of atoms in an atomtronic circuit is not known _ a priori _ and is likely not conserved .",
    "therefore , one has to solve the more general time - dependent problem accounting for the influence of atom injection and extraction on bec dynamics .",
    "second , the necessary computations can not be so demanding as to prevent timely and comprehensive parametric studies .",
    "our starting point remains the bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "however , we choose to work in the heisenberg picture and use a cluster expansion approach to circumvent the complication of a rapidly increasing configuration space with an increasing number of atoms .",
    "the approach involves tracking the time evolution of atomic populations in the stationary states of the confining potential .",
    "many - body equations of motion for atomic populations and coherences are derived .",
    "they contain hopping effects , energy renormalizations , and coherences within the context of a mean - field approximation .",
    "collisions giving rise to relaxation and dephasing are modeled phenomenologically using an effective relaxation rate approximation , with the effective relaxation rates obtained from experiment or quantum kinetic calculations  @xcite , for example .",
    "this type of treatment is common in quantum electronics  @xcite . beyond the investigation of phase - locking ,",
    "our interest is to understand the extent to which the considerable body of work in many - body semiconductor laser theory  @xcite can provide tools for designing and analyzing atomtronic devices and circuits .    within our model",
    "a trade - off is made between rigor and mitigation of numerical demands .",
    "the result is an approach allowing parametric studies involving timescales spanning over three orders of magnitude . with this dynamical range",
    "rapid population dynamics relevant to non - equilibrium effects can be modeled , as well as the long time durations typical of steady - state device operation .",
    "the tracking of slow device dynamics is extremely challenging for the rigorous quantum kinetic approaches .",
    "lastly , limiting the computational demand allows other details of an atomtronic circuit to be included , such as those involving atom injection and extraction processes , as well as complex confinement potentials .",
    "the end product is a predictive and flexible model that can be used for designing atomtronic devices and analyzing experimental data .    using the model , we address bec phase - locking in a system that is simplified , but also geared more towards circuitry than the fully isolated system of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the model potential used for our current study .     confining potential ( solid , black ) for the double - well geometry being studied .",
    "the parabolas ( dashed , black ) represent the potentials for the uncoupled wells .",
    "also plotted are the eigenfunctions ( solid , blue and red ) of each well displaced vertically according to energy .",
    "]    the system consists of two , weakly coupled harmonic wells of different frequency where atoms are injected into the left - hand well and extracted from the right - hand well .",
    "additionally , atoms are extracted from the highest energy states in each well analogous to the process of evaporative cooling used in typical bec experiments .",
    "notably , establishment of a phase relationship between coupled becs has been studied previously in a similar geometry  @xcite where dissipation and atomic interactions were found to play a key role in the phase - locking mechanism . in this work we study this phase evolution under the influence of atom injection ; and , as will be shown below",
    ", the strength of coupling between the ground states of each well strongly dictates the steady - state behaviour of the system .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii provides a description of the theory and model development .",
    "the working many - body equations of motion are presented and the collision model described .",
    "section iii illustrates an application of the model to study atom transport between two adjacent harmonic potentials in the presence of atom injection and extraction .",
    "the simulations show two distinct dynamical scenarios involving the phase - locking of states in the different wells .",
    "section iv summarizes the results and discusses future improvements to the model .",
