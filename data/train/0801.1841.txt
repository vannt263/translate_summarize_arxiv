    "the transiting exoplanets are only a small subset of all the known planets orbiting other stars , but they hold tremendous promise for deepening our understanding of planetary formation , structure , and evolution .",
    "observations of transits and occultations ( along with the spectroscopic orbit of the host star ) not only allow one to measure the mass and radius of the planet , but also provide opportunities to measure the stellar spin - orbit alignment @xcite , the planetary brightness temperature @xcite , the planetary day - night temperature difference @xcite , and even absorption lines of planetary atmospheric constituents @xcite . these and other observations have been accompanied by theoretical progress in modeling the physical processes in the planetary interiors and atmospheres , as well as the planets interactions with their parent stars .",
    "this rapid progress has been stimulated in no small measure by the remarkable diversity of planet characteristics that has been found among the members of the transiting ensemble .",
    "the accuracy and precision with which the properties of the planet can be derived from transit data depend strongly on whatever measurements and assumptions are made regarding the host star .",
    "for example , for a given value of the transit depth , the inferred planetary radius scales in proportion to the assumed stellar radius ; and for a given spectroscopic orbit of the host star , the inferred planetary mass scales as the two - thirds power of the stellar mass . in the literature on transiting planets , a wide variety of methods",
    "have been used to estimate the radius and mass of the parent star , ranging from simply looking them up in a table of average stellar properties as a function of spectral type , all the way to fitting detailed stellar evolutionary models constrained by the luminosity , effective temperature , and other observations that may be available for the star . as a result , the ensemble of planet properties at our disposal is inhomogeneous , and in many cases the uncertainty of those determinations is dominated by systematic errors in the stellar parameters that are treated differently by different investigators .",
    "this situation is unfortunate because it hinders our ability to gauge the reliability of any patterns that are discerned among the ensemble properties of transiting exoplanets . with 23 systems that have been reported in the literature",
    ", this subfield should be poised for the transition from a handful of results to a large and diverse enough sample for meaningful general conclusions to be drawn , but the heterogeneity of reported results is clearly an obstacle .    it may be surprising that we are limited in many cases by our knowledge of the properties of the parent stars ; one would think that stellar physics is a `` solved problem '' in comparison to exoplanetary physics .",
    "however it must be remembered that the host stars are usually isolated ( and therefore no dynamical mass measurement is possible ) , and that many of the host stars are distant enough that they do not even have measured parallaxes .",
    "of the 23 cases in the literature , five have  parallaxes @xcite . for those few",
    "it is fairly straightforward to estimate the stellar properties , but for the other systems , more indirect methods have been used .",
    "these indirect methods often rely on the value of the stellar surface gravity that is derived by measuring the depths and shapes of gravity - sensitive absorption lines in the stellar spectrum .",
    "this is a notoriously difficult measurement and the result is often strongly correlated with other parameters that affect the spectrum .",
    "recently , however , @xcite , holman et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and others demonstrated that it is possible to do better by using the information about the mean stellar density that is encoded in the transit light curve .",
    "this information was typically overlooked prior to these studies .",
    "the study presented in this paper was motivated by the desire for a homogeneous analysis , and by the desire to take advantage of the photometric estimates of the stellar mean density .",
    "we have revisited the determination of the stellar parameters for all of the transiting planets that have been reported in the literature .",
    "we have taken the opportunity to merge all existing measurements of the atmospheric parameters ( mainly the effective temperature and metallicity ) with the goal of presenting the best possible values .",
    "we have chosen a uniform method for analyzing photometric data and have re - analyzed existing light curves where necessary to provide homogeneity .",
    "our hope was that by applying these procedures across the board , we and other investigators could view the ensemble properties with greater clarity and uncover any interesting clues the transiting planets might provide us about the origin , structure , and evolution of exoplanets .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . ",
    "[ sec : stellar ] describes the procedures by which we estimated the stellar properties , using the available spectroscopic and photometric datasets , and a particular set of theoretical stellar evolution models . as a check on the models ,  [ sec : modchecks ]",
    "compares the results of a subset of our calculations with those derived from a different set of evolutionary models .",
    " [ sec : obschecks ] investigates alternate ways of estimating the stellar properties . ",
    "[ sec : gj436 ] deals with gj  436 , which needs special treatment because the host star has such a lower mass than the other host stars . ",
    "[ sec : results ] presents the final results for the planetary parameters . ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] uses the new results to check on some of the previously proposed correlations among the properties of the transiting ensemble , and  [ sec : remarks ] provides final remarks .",
    "the appendix lists the data sets and other issues that are particular to each system .",
    "for a transiting planet , the basic data are the spectroscopic orbit of the star ( radial - velocity curve ) , and the photometric observations of transits ( light curve ) . with such data ,",
    "the planetary mass and radius can not be determined independently of the stellar properties .",
    "the radial - velocity curve can be used to determine @xmath0^{2/3}\\ ] ] ( in units of the mass of jupiter ) , where @xmath1 is the inclination angle of the orbit , @xmath2 is the orbital period in days , @xmath3 is the eccentricity , and @xmath4 the velocity semi - amplitude of the star in .",
    "even when @xmath5 is known precisely , the value of the planetary mass @xmath6 that is derived from the data will scale as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mass of the star .",
    "meanwhile , the light curve does not immediately yield @xmath9 , the planetary radius ; rather , the ratio of the radii @xmath10 is pinned down through the depth of the transit .",
    "the stellar mass and radius are usually inferred indirectly , from an analysis of high - resolution spectra of the star with the aid of model atmospheres , followed by a comparison of the atmospheric parameters with stellar evolution models .",
    "the latter step is performed somewhat differently by different authors depending on the observational constraints available . for this work",
    "we have compiled and critically reviewed all of the available information regarding the atmospheric properties of the host stars .",
    "this effort is described in  [ sec : atmospheric ] .",
    "the approach adopted in this paper makes use of information from the light curves of transiting planets to constrain the mean density of the star , @xmath11 , following @xcite . as described therein , the quantity @xmath12 ( the planet - star separation @xmath13 in units of the stellar radius ) is directly related to the mean stellar density ( hereafter , simply the density ) , and can be derived from the photometry without much knowledge about the star ( see below ) .",
    "the only dependence @xmath12 has on the stellar properties is through the limb - darkening coefficients , which is typically a second - order effect ( see  [ sec : lightcurves ] ) .",
    "many of the published light curve analyses do not report the value of @xmath12 explicitly , and it is difficult or impossible to reconstruct its value accurately from the published information .",
    "it is especially difficult to obtain a good measure of the true uncertainty in @xmath14 from the published information .",
    "for this reason , and for the sake of homogeneity , we have re - analyzed many of the high - quality photometric time - series available to us for all transiting planets .",
    "we describe this effort in  [ sec : lightcurves ] .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic studies have been undertaken for almost all of the parent stars of the known transiting planets .",
    "the basic products of these studies are measurements of the effective temperature @xmath15 , iron abundance [ fe / h ] , and surface gravity @xmath16 .",
    "the quoted precision of these determinations varies widely , depending on the signal - to - noise ratio and resolution of the observations , the modeling techniques employed , and the attitude taken toward systematic errors .    for this work we have relied on published determinations , rather than any new spectroscopic data . in many cases , a given transiting system has been described by more than one analysis , and they do not necessarily agree . in those cases , rather than arbitrarily choosing the most recent study , or the one with the smallest uncertainties , we critically examined all of the available studies and combined them .",
    "our choices are documented in the appendix .",
    "we were guided by our own experience and increased the error estimates whenever they seemed optimistic .",
    "for example , many of the automated spectroscopic analysis tools in common use today return formal uncertainties for the effective temperatures that are only a few tens of degrees kelvin ; for one of the transiting systems the quoted error was only 13  k. there is ample literature on the subject of the absolute effective temperature scale and the systematic errors inherent in placing any single system on such a scale .",
    "a recent investigation by @xcite has shown that there are still differences of order 100  k between temperatures derived from the spectroscopic condition of excitation equilibrium and from the infrared flux method ( irfm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other studies have indicated discrepancies of 50100  k between different temperature scales @xcite , and discussed at length possible sources for these errors . in light of these findings , we considered it prudent to adopt temperature errors no smaller than 50  k for our study , and then only when there are several independent and consistent determinations or other evidence supporting that level of accuracy .",
    "similar concerns hold for the spectroscopic surface gravities , although we do not actually make use of them in this work , as described below . for the spectroscopic metallicities",
    ", we adopted a minimum uncertainty of 0.05 dex ( for the best cases with multiple independent measurements ) , even though smaller errors have occasionally been reported for individual analyses .",
    "this is mainly because of the strong correlations present among [ fe / h ] , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as some evidence for systematic differences between different groups ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the appendix we provide a complete listing of the sources we have drawn from in each case .",
    "the values of @xmath15 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath16 finally adopted for all systems are listed in table  [ tab : atmospheric ] .",
    "some degree of non - uniformity in these quantities is unavoidable due to the variety of procedures used by different authors , but we believe they represent the best available set for the parent stars based on current knowledge .      for each system , we examined the highest - quality transit photometry available to us in order to determine the key parameters @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 .",
    "our methodology is described below , and the details of the data sets that were used in each case are given in the appendix . in some cases ,",
    "the published determinations of @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 matched our own methodology very closely , and we simply adopted the values from the literature ; these cases are also specified in the appendix .    in the absence of limb darkening , the four primary observables in a transit light curve are the midtransit time , the depth , the total duration , and the partial - phase duration ( ingress or egress ) .",
    "a sequence of measured midtransit times usually leads to a very precise determination of the orbital period @xmath2 .",
    "the depth is equal to the planet - to - star radius ratio , @xmath18 . at fixed @xmath2 ,",
    "the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath14 can be written in terms of the total and partial durations through an application of kepler s law ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with limb darkening , however ,",
    "there is no longer a well - defined depth or partial duration ; an accurate light curve model must include a realistic intensity distribution across the stellar disk , which will depend on the stellar temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity .",
    "thus , to some degree , the determination of @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 must be accompanied by some assumptions about the stellar properties .",
    "our procedure was as follows .",
    "we modeled each system using a two - body keplerian orbit .",
    "the star has mass @xmath19 and radius @xmath20 , and the planet has mass @xmath6 and radius @xmath9 .",
    "the orbit has period @xmath2 , eccentricity @xmath3 , argument of pericenter @xmath21 , and inclination @xmath1 . for our purpose",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath2 was completely negligible ; we fixed @xmath2 at the most precisely determined value in the literature .",
    "in almost all cases , the radial - velocity data are consistent with a circular orbit , and we assumed @xmath22 exactly . for hat - p-2 ( hd  147506 )",
    "we fixed the values of @xmath3 and @xmath21 at those that have been derived from radial - velocity data ( and in the end we verified that changing these parameters by 1@xmath23 does not significantly affect any of our final results ) .",
    "the initial condition is specified by a particular midtransit time @xmath24 . when the sky projections of the star and planet do not overlap , the model flux is unity .",
    "when they do overlap we use the analytic formulas of @xcite to compute the integral of the intensity over the unobscured portion of the stellar disk , assuming a quadratic limb - darkening law .",
    "to arrive at a self - consistent solution including limb darkening , we began with initial values for @xmath19 and @xmath6 from the literature .",
    "we also chose values for the stellar @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and metallicity , as described in the previous section .",
    "then we adopted limb - darkening coefficients based on those stellar parameters , by interpolating the tables of @xcite for the appropriate bandpass . at this point",
    "we estimated all of the remaining parameters ( using the procedure described in the next paragraph ) and used the result for @xmath14 to update the determination of the stellar properties .",
    "then , a new photometric parameter estimation was performed , with revised values of @xmath19 , @xmath6 and the limb - darkening coefficients , and so forth .",
    "this procedure converged after two or three iterations , in the sense that further iterations changed none of the parameters by more than about a tenth of the statistical error .",
    "the parameter estimations were carried out with a markov chain monte carlo algorithm ( mcmc ; see , e.g. , @xcite for applications to cosmological data , @xcite for radial - velocity data , and @xcite or @xcite for a similar approach to transit fitting ) .",
    "it is based on the goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath25 ^ 2 , \\label{eq : chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath26(obs ) is the flux observed at time @xmath27 and @xmath28 controls the weights of the data points , and @xmath26(calc ) is the flux calculated with our model . in the mcmc algorithm ,",
    "a stochastic process is used to create a sequence of points in parameter space whose density approximates the joint _ a posteriori _ probability density for all parameters .",
    "one begins with an initial point and iterates a jump function , which in our case was the addition of a gaussian random number ( `` perturbation '' ) to a randomly chosen parameter .",
    "if the new point has a lower @xmath29 , the jump is executed ; if not , the jump is executed with probability @xmath30 .",
    "we adjusted the sizes of the perturbations until approximately @xmath3125% of jumps are executed for each parameter .",
    "for the data weights @xmath28 , we used the observed standard deviation of the out - of - transit data ( @xmath32 ) , multiplied by a factor @xmath33 to account at least approximately for time - correlated errors ( `` red '' noise ) which are often significant for ground - based data .",
    "we chose @xmath34 as follows .",
    "the key timescale is the partial - phase duration , because the limiting error in the determination of @xmath14 and @xmath1 is generally the fractional error in the partial - phase duration .",
    "we averaged the out - of - transit data over this timescale , with each time bin consisting of @xmath35 points depending on the cadence of observations , and then calculated the standard deviation of the binned data , @xmath36 .",
    "finally we set @xmath37 . with white noise only",
    ", we would observe @xmath38 , but in practice @xmath39 because the number of effectively independent data points is smaller than the actual number of data points .",
    "for this paper we deliberately chose to analyze only those data for which @xmath40 .    for each parameter",
    ", we took the mode of the mcmc distribution after marginalizing over all other parameters to be the `` best value . ''",
    "we defined the 68% confidence limits @xmath41 and @xmath42 as the values for which the integral of the distribution between @xmath43 and @xmath42 is 0.68 , and the integrals from the minimum value to @xmath41 and from @xmath42 to the maximum value were both @xmath44 .",
    "in some cases the mode was all the way at one end of the probability distribution ; in particular there were several cases in which @xmath45 was the mode of the inclination distribution .",
    "in those cases we report @xmath42 as @xmath46 and @xmath41 as the value for which the integral from zero to @xmath43 was @xmath47 .",
    "the final results are given in table  [ tab : lcfits ] , including the stellar density @xmath11 computed directly from @xmath12 and the period .",
    "the fundamental parameters for the host stars are derived here using stellar evolution models .",
    "we rely on the spectroscopically determined @xmath15 and [ fe / h ] , and we require also an indicator of luminosity ( @xmath48 ) or some other measure of evolution . since most of these stars lack a parallax measurement , the spectroscopic surface gravity has often been used in the past as a luminosity indicator .",
    "the effect of @xmath16 on the spectral lines is relatively subtle , and strong correlations between @xmath16 and both temperature and metallicity make these determinations challenging .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that an important property intrinsic to the star , the _ density _ , is encoded in the transit light curves mainly through its dependence on the transit duration .",
    "as shown there , and more explicitly by @xcite , the density is directly related to @xmath12 , one of the parameters often solved for in modeling the photometry .",
    "this quantity can typically be determined more precisely than @xmath16 and it is highly sensitive to the degree of evolution of the star , i.e. , to its size .",
    "thus , it serves as a better proxy for luminosity in many cases .",
    "we illustrate this below .    to determine the stellar mass and radius , and other relevant properties of the host stars , we follow the procedure described by @xcite with minor improvements , and compare model isochrones directly with the measured values of @xmath15 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath12 .",
    "the latter can be calculated from the models as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the newtonian gravitational constant , and the period @xmath2 is well known from the photometry .",
    "the planet mass @xmath6 is not known a priori , but its influence is very small compared to the stellar mass @xmath8 , and even a rough value is usually sufficient for this application .",
    "once the stellar mass is known , the process can be repeated if necessary with an improved value of @xmath6 .",
    "the stellar evolution models we use are those from the yonsei - yale ( y@xmath51 ) series by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are conveniently provided with tools for interpolating isochrones in both age and metallicity .",
    "elements can also have a significant effect on the inferred stellar properties .",
    "about half of the transiting systems have at least one study in the literature reporting abundances for several of the @xmath52 elements ( mg , si , s , ca , ti , c , and o ) : hd  209458 ( 3 studies ) , tres-1 ( 2 studies ) , wasp-1 , xo-1 , xo-2 , and the five ogle systems ( one study each ) . in all cases",
    "the average enhancement is not significantly different from zero .",
    "we therefore assume here that it is zero for all systems . ]",
    "we explore the full range of metallicities allowed by the observational errors in [ fe / h ] , sampling @xmath3120 equally spaced values for each system . for each metallicity",
    "we consider a range of ages from 0.1 to 14 gyr , in steps of 0.1 gyr .",
    "these isochrones are interpolated to a fine grid in mass , and compared point by point with the measured values of @xmath15 and @xmath12 . all locations ( `` matches '' ) on the isochrone that are consistent with these quantities within the observational errors are recorded .",
    "we also record the corresponding likelihood given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54}\\over \\sigma_{\\rm [ fe / h]}}\\right)^2 + \\left({\\delta t_{\\rm eff}\\over \\sigma_{t_{\\rm",
    "eff}}}\\right)^2 + \\left({\\delta(a / r_{\\star})\\over \\sigma_{a / r_{\\star}}}\\right)^2\\ ] ] and the @xmath55 quantities represent the difference between the observed and model values at each point .",
    "observational errors are assumed to be gaussian , and the asymmetric error bars in @xmath12 were taken into account .",
    "the best - fit values for each stellar property are obtained by computing the sum over all matches , weighted by their corresponding likelihood .",
    "additionally , we account for the varying density of stars on each isochrone prescribed by the initial mass function ( imf ) , by multiplying the weights by the number density of stars at each location as provided with the y@xmath51 isochrones .",
    "the imf adopted is a power law with a salpeter index .",
    "the effect of this latter weighting is generally small .",
    "the results for each system are listed in table  [ tab : stellar ] , where we give in addition to the mass and radius the theoretical values of @xmath56 , luminosity @xmath48 , absolute visual magnitude @xmath57 , and evolutionary age . in several cases our results differ slightly from those reported in recent discovery papers that use the same atmospheric parameters adopted here and apply the @xmath12 constraint essentially in the same way we have .",
    "the present study represents a slight improvement for those systems due to the application of weights , as described above .",
    "-0.2 in -0.3 in    the relative errors of the stellar masses and radii determined here have median values of about 6% and 4% , respectively , but with wide ranges depending on the precision of the observables ( 2% to 13% for @xmath58 , and 1.3% to 12% for @xmath59 ) .",
    "while all of the stars in the current sample are hydrogen - burning stars , the degree of evolution within the main sequence varies considerably ( see figure  [ fig : evolution ] ) .",
    "some systems such as tres-3 ( # 11 ) and xo-1 ( # 15 ) are near the zero - age main sequence ; others like hat - p-4 ( # 20 ) have already lived for @xmath3190% of their main - sequence lifetime .",
    "the age is a critical ingredient for the theoretical modeling of the structure and evolution of exoplanets ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yet it is among the most difficult properties to determine for isolated main - sequence stars . for the host stars of transiting planets the evolutionary ages span the full range , as seen in figure  [ fig : ages ] .",
    "the difficulty mentioned above is most evident for the less evolved objects ( @xmath8 less than about 0.9  m@xmath60 ) , which are all seen to have large error bars that can reach the upper limit of 14  gyr considered here . for those cases",

    "as a simple test , we considered a second set of models by @xcite that has often been used by other investigators in the field of transiting planets .",

    "the @xcite models are publicly available only for solar metallicity , so the comparison was limited to transiting systems with [ fe / h ] within about 0.1 dex of the sun , and with [ fe / h ] uncertainties that keep them within 0.2 dex of solar .",
    "of the six systems in this range , one ( ogle - tr-113 ) gave no solution consistent with the observed values of @xmath15 and @xmath12 .",

    "it seems unlikely that this is a statistical fluke .",
    "however , the scatter is still larger than the formal observational uncertainties , suggesting that these three variables are not completely determinative",
    ".    what might be the implications of this metallicity dependence ?",
    "it has been proposed that the mass - period relation is related to the process by which close - in exoplanets migrated inward from their formation sites , or more specifically , to the mechanism that halts migration at orbital periods of a few days .",
    "the trend of larger masses at shorter orbital periods could suggest that the halting mechanism depends on mass , and larger planets are able to migrate further in .",
    "the dependence on metallicity may then be interpreted to indicate that planets in metal - poor systems need to be more massive in order to migrate inward to the same orbital period as more metal - rich planets . in this context , the trend in figure  [ fig : mp]b could be interpreted as evidence that the efficiency of the migration ( or halting ) mechanism is affected to some degree by the chemical composition .",
    "a dependence of migration on metallicity is in fact predicted by some theories , and could arise , as pointed out by @xcite , either from slower migration rates in metal - poor protoplanetary disks @xcite or through longer timescales for giant planet formation around metal - poor stars , which would effectively reduce the efficiency of migration before the disk dissipates @xcite .",
    "however , the above processes are more aimed at addressing the apparent lack of short - period planets among very metal - poor stars claimed by some authors ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas among the transiting planets it is not the lack of more metal - poor examples we are concerned with , but rather their different properties ( such as mass ) compared to metal - rich planets _ at the same orbital period_. to give a quantitative example , we find that for a period of 2.5 days ( near the average for known transiting systems ) , the mass of a planet with [ fe / h ] @xmath104 is @xmath3140% larger than one with average metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = + 0.13 , excluding hat - p-2b and gj  436b ) , while the mass of a planet with [ fe / h ] @xmath105 is about 30% smaller .",
    "this range of metallicities , from [ fe / h ] @xmath104 to + 0.4 ( covering a factor of 4 in metal enhancement ) , is approximately the full range observed .",
    "we note that the strength of the metallicity effect is modest rather than overwhelming , and this too is in agreement with theoretical expectations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the massive planet hat - p-2b obviously does not conform to this trend of @xmath6 versus period , which may indicate some fundamental difference either in its formation or migration .",
    "an alternative interpretation , also proposed by @xcite , is that the @xmath6 versus @xmath2 relation is more a reflection of survival requirements in close proximity to the star , due to thermal evaporation from the extreme uv flux .",
    "close - in planets must be more massive to avoid ablation to the point of undetectability .",
    "the role of metallicity in this case would be through the difference in the internal structure @xcite .",
    "metal - rich planets have been suggested to be more likely to develop rocky cores ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also  [ sec : cores ] ) .",
    "if the presence of such a core somehow slows down or prevents complete evaporation , as has been proposed @xcite , survival at a given period would then have a dependence on metallicity .",
    "-0.35 in -0.3 in    a diagram related to the one considered above is that of planetary surface gravity versus orbital period , first presented by @xcite . because @xmath106 does not require knowledge of the mass or radius of the star , it is in a sense a cleaner quantity that should be free from systematic errors in @xmath8 and @xmath89 and is nearly independent of stellar evolution models .",
    "this not true of other bulk properties such as the mean planet density . an updated version of the @xmath106 versus @xmath2 relation is shown in figure  [ fig : loggperiod ] , along with a linear fit .",

    "@xcite pointed out a gap in the distribution of safronov numbers , and defined class  i planets as those with @xmath113 and class  ii as @xmath114 .",
    "they tentatively proposed also that these two categories have other distinguishing characteristics , such as a difference in the average temperature of the host stars , or the orbital separations . upon the discovery of hat - p-5b @xcite and hat - p-6b @xcite ,",
    "those authors pointed out that the distinction now seems less clear , as these two planets tend to fill the gap between class  i and class  ii .",
    "the larger sample now available , and especially the more accurate and homogeneous set of properties presented here , offers the opportunity to revisit the issue .",
    "figure  [ fig : safronov ] shows an updated version of the @xmath111@xmath112 diagram for transiting planets , which has some significant differences compared to the original version .",
    "following @xcite we have excluded the massive planet hat - p-2b , with a safronov number so much larger than all the others ( @xmath115 ) that it would seem to be in a different class altogether , as well as gj  436b , which is of much lower mass and a presumably different composition .",

( the class  ii object with the lowest value of @xmath111 is ogle - tr-111b [ # 6 ] . )",
    "thus , the dichotomy remains very suggestive .",
    "@xcite have argued that the principal distinction between the two classes is based on mass ( planetary and/or stellar ) , and that planets of class  ii are , on average , less massive than those in class  i , and orbit stars that are typically more massive . while we agree with the latter part of this statement regarding the _ stellar _ masses , we find that the distribution of _ planetary _ masses is indistinguishable between the two groups .",
    "we do confirm , however , that an updated diagram of @xmath6 versus @xmath112 ( see figure  [ fig : masstemp ] ) shows planets in class  ii to be systematically less massive _ for the same equilibrium temperature _ ( level of irradiation ) , as was also found by @xcite , so in this sense their general claim that the distinction has something to do with mass seems to be supported by the observations .",
