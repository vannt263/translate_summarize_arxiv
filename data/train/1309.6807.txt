    "the interplay between ferromagnetism and superconductivity in hybrid structures has recently attracted considerable attention because of the underlying rich physics and potential applications in spintronics  @xcite . in a homogeneous ferromagnet ( f )",

    "this component penetrates into the ferromagnet over a large distance , which can be on the order of the normal metal coherence length @xmath21 in some cases .",

    "in this article , we have calculated the josephson current by btk approach in clean s@xmath181s junctions with noncollinear magnetization .",
    "moreove , to demonstrate changes of the critical current , we also study the singlet and triplet pair amplitude and the local density of states in ferromagnets by using bogoliubov s self - consistent method .",
    "we have shown that the dependence long - range triplet critical current with the strength of exchange field and thickness of the interface layers shows an oscillatory behavior , when the interface magnetizations are orthogonal to the central magnetization .",
    "this change of the critical current is induced by the oscillations of ( @xmath0@xmath182@xmath168+@xmath0@xmath183@xmath168)@xmath184 with frequency @xmath163 .",
    "in addition , when the orientations of the magnetizations in interface layers rotate from _ z_-axis to _ x_-axis , the critical current always exhibits a nonmonotic behavior .",
