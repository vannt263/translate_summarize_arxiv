    "will either be absorbed ( @xmath9 ) , or it has a sufficiently large transverse energy to suffer only the onset of equilibration processes ( @xmath10 ) . in the latter case , the parton appears as a medium - modified jet . for lower transverse energies ,",
    "there is not only a competition between the hadronization and the thermalization mechanism ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "there is also the possibility that the medium interferes with the dynamics of the hadronization process ( @xmath12 ) . for even lower transverse momentum ,",

[ fig2 ] ) , all observed high-@xmath13 hadrons have hadronized _ outside _ the medium . since hadronization of a parton depends only on its identity but not on its history , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] implies that the ratio of different identified leading hadrons stays unchanged with respect to @xmath17@xmath17 collisions while their absolute yield is suppressed with respect to the binary scaling assumption . in au+au collisions at rhic ,",
    "this is observed in the particle species dependence of the nuclear modification factor  @xcite , which ceases for hadronic transverse momenta @xmath18@xmath19 gev  @xcite ( this corresponds to higher partonic momenta @xmath20@xmath21 gev ) .",

    "= 11.7 cm    to account for the partonic medium - modification prior to hadronization , we must understand how the parton showers associated to hard partonic production processes interact with a dense medium .",
    "this is a difficult problem , which is not solved completely .",
    "all existing approaches  @xcite indicate that the leading parton loses additional energy owing to medium - induced gluon radiation and that the parton shower broadens in transverse momentum .",
    "remarkably , only one property of the medium enters these calculations , namely the amount @xmath24 of transverse momentum squared that the medium transfers to the parton per unit pathlength .",
    "momentum broadening is characterised by @xmath25  @xcite , the additional radiated energy is determined by the characteristic energy scale @xmath26  @xcite , and medium effects regulate the additional gluon radiation in the infrared on a scale @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "also , the expansion of the medium can be controlled in these calculations  @xcite .",
    "since the transport coefficient is proportional to the density of scattering centres , it decreases in time , @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting medium - induced radiation spectrum corresponds to the spectrum of an equivalent static medium in which all kinematic variables are rescaled by the linear line - averaged transport coefficient @xmath29  @xcite . in practice",
    ", this dynamical scaling law allows a simplified data analysis in terms of static medium properties ; a posteriori , one then translates the extracted static average transport coefficient into the realistic dynamical one .",
    "so far , comparisons of this formalism to data are limited to the leading hadron spectra and leading back - to - back correlations . in this case",
    ", the reduced energy of the leading hadron directly traces the reduced energy of the leading parton ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) ; the reduction is expected to depend mainly on the parameter combination @xmath30 .",
    "the most advanced comparisons with data  @xcite reproduce the absolute scale of the nuclear modification factor and its centrality dependence .",
    "this allows us to disentangle information on geometry ( @xmath8 ) and density ( @xmath24 ) . a satisfactory agreement with data",
    "is found for an initial energy density of @xmath31 at initial time @xmath32 fm / c  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other determinations , this is an energy density with which a hard parton was _",

    "based on @xmath34 , one can estimate the duration @xmath35 over which the density was above the critical energy density @xmath36 predicted by lattice qcd .",
    "one finds @xmath37 fm / c , where the central value is for a one - dimensional bjorken expansion ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 fm / c is associated to model - intrinsic uncertainties .",
    "these stem from our limited knowledge of the dynamical expansion and evolving geometrical distribution of scattering centres , and from significant uncertainties related to the high - energy approximations employed by all current calculations ( for a quantitative discussion , see refs .",
    "other systematic errors ( e.g. those associated to the perturbative calculation of medium - induced gluon radiation ) are more difficult to quantify",
    ".    how can we further test the partonic mechanism of medium - induced gluon radiation assumed to underlie medium - modified high-@xmath13 hadroproduction ?",
    "current theory predicts i ) the dependence of medium effects on @xmath8 , ii ) their dependence on the parton identity , and iii ) the relation between leading parton energy loss and transverse - momentum broadening of the parton shower . in my view , the perspectives for refined tests are the following : + i ) _ dependence on geometry _ : the approximately quadratic dependence on the in - medium pathlength @xmath8 is a characteristic feature of non - abelian partonic energy loss  @xcite .",
    "typical observables sensitive to it are the azimuthal anisotropy @xmath40 at high @xmath13 , the centrality dependence of leading hadron spectra and their back - to - back correlations . in practice",
    ", however , uncertainties in modelling the geometry and dynamics of the collision , as well as current experimental systematic errors make it difficult so far to discriminate even between a linear and a quadratic dependences on @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "+ ii ) _ dependence on parton identity : _ a ) hard gluons are expected to suffer larger final - state medium effects than hard quarks since their coupling is stronger .",
    "sensitive to this effect is , for example , the ratio of any pair of leading hadrons that receive different contributions from parent quarks and parent gluons ( e.g. the @xmath41 ratio ) .",
    "in practice , however , an analysis of these measurements is complicated by the experimental limitations on high-@xmath13 particle identification , and by the uncertainties in the vacuum fragmentation functions at large momentum fraction @xmath42  @xcite . at",
    "sufficiently high luminosity and/or centre - of - mass energy , a more promising test of gluon propagation in matter may be @xmath43-jet or three - jet ( @xmath44 ) events where tagged leptonic or hadronic high-@xmath13 information signals the presence of a gluon .",
    "b ) massive quarks are expected to show smaller medium modifications than massless ones and this should show up in the leading charmed and beauty hadrons  @xcite .",
    "however , for massive quarks , @xmath45 is reduced since massive quarks are slower , and @xmath5 is increased since they lose less energy . as a consequence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the transverse energy scale where @xmath11 and partonic energy loss calculations start to apply may lie at the upper end of the current experimental data , above @xmath46 gev .",
    "+ iii ) _ beyond leading hadron spectra : _ calculations predict how the energy lost by the leading parton is redistributed in transverse phase space  @xcite .",
    "ideally , this can be tested by reconstructing the total energy associated to the initial parent parton , i.e. by measuring the `` medium - modified jet '' .",
    "the corresponding jet production cross section is expected to follow binary scaling , but the jet shape is broadened and the jet multiplicity is softened and increased  @xcite . the main problem of calorimetric jet measurements is the underlying high - multiplicity background . at present",
    ", this is studied intensively for the heavy - ion programme at the lhc , and first jet observables are known , which are sensitive to transverse - momentum broadening but insensitive to the low-@xmath13 background  @xcite .",
    "where calorimetric measurements are not feasible , a pragmatic widely adopted alternative is the study of jet - like near - side particle correlations associated to high-@xmath13 trigger particles  @xcite .",
    "finding in this way the lost remnants of jets is certainly an important qualitative support of the assumption of medium - induced final - state energy loss .",
    "however , it is difficult to compare the trigger selection of a special subclass of all jets ( namely those with a particularly energetic leading hadron ) with current parton energy loss calculations without significant further assumptions .",
    "this is so because theory is more reliable for energy distributions than for multiplicity distributions ( which require a more detailed knowledge of hadronization ) , and because the same leading - particle trigger selects significantly different jet classes with different average @xmath0 depending on the a priori unknown medium modification .",
    "hadronization is the non - perturbative process that bleaches coloured partons into sets of hadronic states . as of today",
    ", its dynamics remains a black box ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) which is filled differently by different hadronization models .",
    "a satisfactory theoretical understanding exists only at sufficiently high @xmath13 when factorization theorems are applicable .",
    "this black box can then be bypassed by a simple mapping , the fragmentation function @xmath47 . in this case , the only dynamical information accessible about hadronization is the dependence on the scale @xmath48 at which perturbative physics is interfaced with @xmath47 .",
    "this limits the possibility to study _ how _ hadronization proceeds .",
    "the same mapping @xmath47 is applied in the current description of medium - modified hard processes ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the particle ratio of leading protons / pions is predicted to trace the ratio of the corresponding fragmentation functions , @xmath49 .",
    "however , in au+au collisions for @xmath50 gev , one observes a marked deviation  @xcite from this perturbative ratio , which increases with centrality and reaches unity .",
    "thus , perturbative fragmentation breaks down in au+au collisions although it is known to provide a satisfactory description of the particle species dependence of elementary @xmath51 or hadronic collisions in the same intermediate-@xmath13 regime .",
    "the scale @xmath52 gev where this happens lies in the range where @xmath53 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the much larger spatial extension of dense matter in nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions interferes with the hadronization process at higher @xmath13 .",
    "the medium becomes a tool for testing the dynamics of hadronization . from this perspective , the theoretical challenge at intermediate @xmath13 is to discriminate , e.g. between the different proposed prehadronic objects through which hadronization may occur .    at present , such a program has at best started .",
    "different models , which focus on hadronic spectra at intermediate @xmath13 i ) interpolate between soft hydrodynamic evolution and hard high-@xmath13 processes  @xcite , including known nuclear effects  @xcite , ii ) model the dynamics of string fragmentation  @xcite , or iii ) aim to account for data in terms of the recombination of dressed quarks  @xcite .",
    "in all these approaches , the particular non - perturbative model components become numerically unimportant outside the intermediate-@xmath13 regime above @xmath54 gev  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "recombination models offer an explanation for the anomalous particle species dependence at intermediate @xmath13 in terms of a simple prehadronic picture .",
    "for example , they emphasise that the elliptic flow of different baryons and mesons falls on an universal curve @xmath55 if rescaled by the number @xmath56 of valence quarks  @xcite .",
    "this may be interpreted as a remnant of a common underlying partonic flow , which recombines differently for different hadron spectra  @xcite .",
    "it opens the exciting possibility that the partonic flow saturates at a rather small value of @xmath57 but that it is amplified by a factor 23 in the hadronization process . whether this suggestive counting rule can result from a dynamical context ( which should explain , for instance , the fate of gluonic degrees of freedom ) and how it can be discriminated , e.g. from models of string fragmentation , remains to be established .    in short ,",
    "the strongest argument for the novel physics potential at intermediate @xmath13 is the coincidence of scales @xmath58 , which indicates the interference of the hadronization process with the medium .",
    "the data show clear signals of such an interference  @xcite .",
    "hadronic spectra at high and intermediate @xmath13 differ significantly from thermal and chemical equilibrium distributions , but theory relates their medium - dependence dynamically to the onset of partonic equilibration and medium - dependent hadronization . at soft @xmath13 ( @xmath59 gev ) , the challenge is the inverse : many bulk observables show ( approximate ) equilibrium distributions and the task is to establish to what extent this is the consequence of equilibration processes .    in particular , particle ratios do not show significant deviations from chemical equilibrium and can be described by the model of statistical hadronization in terms of a temperature ( @xmath60 mev ) and a baryochemical potential ( @xmath61 mev at @xmath62 gev )  @xcite .",
    "however , the observed equilibrium does not automatically imply a dynamical equilibration mechanism , since statistical particle production according to the principle of maximum entropy is sufficient to motivate the underlying model .",
    "a dynamical origin of the observed equilibrium distribution still remains an intriguing possibility  @xcite , in particular because the extracted temperature and baryochemical potential lie close to the phase - transition line of equilibrated lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "but to establish a firmer link between the phase - transition line to a qgp and the statistical description of hadron yields is most likely to require a better understanding of the hadronization process .",
    "moreover , combinations of the model of statistical hadronization with hydrodynamically motivated parametrisations of the bulk dynamics at kinetic freeze - out ( the so - called `` blastwave models '' ) account well for the particle - species dependence of soft @xmath13 hadronic spectra and their azimuthal dependence",
    "@xmath40  @xcite .",
    "[ intriguingly , this implies that at soft @xmath13 the species dependence of elliptic flow is a mass effect , while it is argued to be a baryon / meson effect at intermediate @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "] these combinations also account for the space - time structure reflected in identical particle correlations , and in particular for the recently measured azimuthal dependence of these correlations , which trace the space - time picture of elliptic flow .",
    "the model parameters extracted from fits to data suggest that the kinetic freeze - out temperature lies significantly below the chemical one ( @xmath63 mev @xmath64 ) and that the system shows a strong collective transverse expansion @xmath65 .",
    "they also suggest a rather short freeze - out time of @xmath66 fm / c .",
    "[ this bound is based on the assumption of bjorken longitudinal expansion .",
    "if the longitudinal expansion is slower as , for instance , suggested by the description of @xmath67 in terms of landau hydrodynamics  @xcite , the freeze - out time can then be significantly larger , see fig . 1 of  @xcite .",
    "] however , blastwave models are only ( physically motivated ) parametrisations of data .",
    "they do not address the question of which microscopic dynamics leads to the observed distributions .",
    "hydrodynamics , based on the assumption of perfect local thermal and chemical equilibrium , is a dynamical explanation .",
    "it can account for hadronic transverse  @xcite and longitudinal  @xcite single - particle spectra and their azimuthal dependence  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , hydrodynamic calculations do not reproduce the identical two - particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "it remains unclear whether this is a problem of hydrodynamics itself  @xcite , or of the freeze - out condition with which hydrodynamics is interfaced  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that hbt measurements test the surface of last scattering , which can change significantly depending on the freeze - out condition while the large mean - free path makes hydrodynamical assumptions questionable . on the other hand ,",
    "a clearly model - intrinsic problem of hydrodynamics is to understand microscopically _ how _ a hydrodynamic behaviour comes about  @xcite .",
    "simulations indicate that for the parton densities and partonic cross sections expected at rhic , the pressure built up in a peripheral collision can result in an elliptic flow of @xmath68 at most .",
    "this falls short of the @xmath69 observed on the hadronic level . here",
    ", the novel provocative suggestion from recombination models is that this small partonic @xmath70 may be almost sufficient since it gets amplified in the hadronization process  @xcite .",
    "it is important to establish whether this is a viable explanation , since this would also strongly affect the understanding of @xmath70 at @xmath59 gev .",
    "if true , it implies that insight into the hadronization process is indispensable for understanding whether and how hydrodynamics works on the partonic level .",
    "the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is not the only way to attach fundamental physics questions to the transverse momentum scale .",
    "saturation physics provides an alternative view .",
    "its starting point is the observed growth of parton distribution functions at small @xmath71 . on general grounds  @xcite",
    ", this growth must be tamed eventually by density effects and it will saturate for densities of order @xmath72 . in this regime , perturbation theory in a high - density background allows for the derivation of density - modifications to the small-@xmath71 bfkl evolution  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the unintegrated gluon distribution is depleted ( saturated ) up to a saturation scale @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "this scale can grow perturbatively large ( possibly @xmath74@xmath75 at rhic ) , and it increases with the nuclear extension ( @xmath76 ) and for small @xmath71 or increasing rapidity @xmath77 ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) .",
    "in addition to the perturbative high-@xmath13 region in which density effects are negligible , saturation physics identifies two transverse - momentum regimes with qualitatively different physics :    _ soft @xmath13 : saturation region .",
    "_ since the initial parton density is depleted , one may expect that less partons will be produced in the collision .",
    "it has been argued that this can explain the low event multiplicities at rhic  @xcite and that it provides a fair description of bulk observables such as rapidity distributions and their centrality dependence  @xcite .",
    "however , a significant model - dependent input is required to interface saturation physics with soft bulk observables , and models based on other equally fundamental physics assumptions are equally successful , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "_ intermediate @xmath13 : scaling window . _ the low-@xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) gluons of a depleted gluon distribution are the dominant source of high-@xmath80 gluon production of during the small-@xmath71 evolution .",
    "hence , small-@xmath71 evolution reduces the growth of the gluon distribution above the saturation scale , in the so - called scaling window @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "since the saturation scale grows with @xmath71 , this scaling window opens as a function of increasing cms energy or rapidity .",
    "one therefore expects in both hadron  nucleus and nucleus  nucleus collisions a suppressed hadroproduction at intermediate @xmath13 iff the saturated gluon distribution is evolved sufficiently far in @xmath71  @xcite . at mid - rapidity at rhic , this scenario is ruled out by the observed opposite centrality dependence of the nuclear modification factor in d  au and au  au  @xcite .",
    "this does not exclude the parton saturation as a viable explanation in the soft regime @xmath83 at rhic mid rapidity .",
    "it just shows that the saturated gluon distribution was not yet evolved sufficiently far in @xmath71 for the scaling window to open .",
    "the observed disappearance of the cronin enhancement in d  au at forward rapidity  @xcite was predicted as a consequence of the small-@xmath71 evolution of a saturated gluon distribution  @xcite . in the context of saturation physics , this signals that the scaling window has opened because of the small-@xmath71 evolution .",
    "however , the agreement is at best qualitative : the studies  @xcite calculate , on the basis of a kinematically simplified partonic cross section , a ratio of gluon spectra ; neither the validity of this simplification , nor the effect of neglecting quarks has been discussed so far .",
    "also , alternative explanations are not fully explored yet . in general ,",
    "if multiple scattering leads to an effective redistribution of hadronic yields not only in transverse but also in longitudinal momentum , this could then deplete the ratio @xmath84 at forward rapidity equally well .",
    "calculations of @xmath84 based on multiple scattering  @xcite did not confirm this effect , but predicted a cronin enhancement at forward rapidity instead .",
    "however , these calculations are based on a high - energy approximation in which a transverse - momentum transfer does not degrade longitudinal momentum and where only elastic multiple - scattering contributions are considered . thus , it is still conceivable that refinements change the result of conventional cronin calculations significantly .    if the interpretation of the rapidity dependence of @xmath84 in terms of saturated gluon distributions stands further tests , then this has far - reaching consequences . at rhic",
    ", one expects further observable traces , in particular for open charm production  @xcite and possibly for dileptons  @xcite . for the lhc , a confirmed onset of parton saturation at forward rhic rapidity implies that the medium attained in pb ",
    "pb collisions at the lhc differs qualitatively from that at rhic , since it corresponds to largely evolved saturated parton densities . in the long term",
    ", this finding would give further support to the already strong case for a dedicated @xmath85@xmath86 experimental program .",
    "in summary , the heavy - ion programs at rhic and the lhc are in the fortunate situation that hadronization and partonic thermalization length scales become comparable in the very range of in - medium pathlength and transverse momentum accessible at collider energies ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the much wider @xmath13-range at rhic and lhc provides a novel tool to disentangle the two recurrent dynamical features of heavy - ion collisions : the dynamics of partonic thermalization and the dynamics of medium - dependent hadronization .",
    "i argued why the main open questions at soft @xmath13 are linked to our poor understanding of hadronization and freeze - out , and how the study of data at intermediate @xmath13 may improve this understanding . at high @xmath13",
    ", i discussed the possibility to study _ how _ an out - of - equilibrium parton ",
    "undisturbed by hadronization evolves towards partonic equilibrium .",
    "this is not only an important step towards qcd thermodynamics .",
    "a refined theoretical understanding of medium - modified hard probes also allows for more detailed tests of the dense bulk matter with strongly interacting penetrating probes .",
    "clearly , the rhic - ness of scales accessible at collider energies is not exhausted by this discussion .",
    "varying other scales such as the @xmath86-dependence and energy dependence of nucleus  nucleus collisions provides complementary information , for example for a precise scan of energy density and baryochemical potential .",
    "also , other views on the wide @xmath13 range , such as saturation physics , may turn out to be more fruitful in the future .",
    "whatever this future may be , progress in the strong interactions has always been based on the interplay of theory and experiment .",
    "the number of accessible scales and fundamental concepts illustrates clearly that at present one of the most active and most diverse fields for this interplay is the study of nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
