    "the existence of a population of luminous absorbed agns , the qso2s , is still a debated issue .",
    "some qso2s could be hidden in the ultraluminous iras galaxies ( ulirgs ; kim & sanders @xcite ) . indeed",
    ", many ulirgs do show agn signatures in their spectra ( veilleux , kim & sanders @xcite ) .",

    "finally , another interesting possibility , which however is still to be verified , is that qso2s appear as normal blue , broad lined qsos in the optical .",
    "while luminous agns with only narrow optical lines are not commonly observed ( see e.g. halpern , turner & george @xcite ) , asca and bepposax have found luminous agns with a hard x  ray spectrum showing broad lines in the optical ( ak00 ; fiore et al .",
    "if the x  ray hardness is due to cold gas absorption , one could therefore suspect that these objects have different dust  to  gas properties with respect to low luminosity agns , where x  ray absorption is generally coupled with an optical type 2 ( only narrow lines ) classification ( maiolino et al .",

    "recent works ( gilli et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper i ; pompilio et al .",

    "observational data seem to confirm this suggestion .",
    "indeed , reeves & turner ( @xcite ) found that in a sample of radio loud and radio quiet qsos observed by asca the fraction of x  ray absorbed agns increases with redshift .",

    "the behaviour of the soft x  ray luminosity function ( xlf ) derived by miyaji , hasinger & schmidt ( @xcite , hereafter mi00a ) from rosat data is indeed consistent with a constant agn density above @xmath10 .    in this work",
    "we examine xrb synthesis models under different assumptions in the input parameters .",
    "we check the differences in reproducing all the available x  ray constraints between a standard model where the ratio r does not evolve with the redshift and a model where absorbed agns evolve more rapidly than unabsorbed ones .",
    "we analyze the effects of neglecting qso2s when the xrb intensity is reproduced only with unobscured agns and low luminosity absorbed agns .",
    "finally , we compare two alternative scenarios where the density of agns at high redshift is constant or declines above @xmath9 .    throughout this paper the deceleration parameter and the hubble constant",
    "are given the values @xmath11 and @xmath12 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "the input agn spectra have been divided into unabsorbed agns and absorbed agns with log@xmath13=21.5,22.5,23.5,24.5,25.5 , as described in paper i. with respect to paper i we introduced a change in the soft excess of unabsorbed sources to get a better agreement with observational data .",
    "indeed , the soft excess is not a general property of the spectra of unobscured agns .",
    "below @xmath14 , where a soft excess is observable in the asca band , about 50% of qsos ( george et al .",
    "@xcite ; reeves & turner @xcite ) and 20% of the seyfert 1s ( reynolds @xcite ) are found to have a soft excess . in the reeves & turner ( @xcite ) sample",
    "the median ratio between the soft excess component and the primary power law in the 0.52 kev band is 0.19 .",
    "we have then approximated this situation by considering a soft excess in _ all _ the unabsorbed agns with a ratio lower by a factor of @xmath0 than the median value of reeves & turner ( @xcite ) .",
    "this soft excess is parametrized with a power law with photon index @xmath15 below 1 kev .",
    "another difference with respect to paper i is in the spectrum of agns absorbed with log@xmath13=24.5 , where we have now introduced an approximated correction for compton scattering .",
    "we interpolated the agn spectra of matt , pompilio & la franca ( @xcite ) ( see their fig .",

    "when compton scattering is added , the intensity of the spectrum of agns with log@xmath13=24.5 decreases by a factor of @xmath0 at 30 kev .",
    "we note that the effect of compton scattering is negligible for the other classes of agns in our model with lower absorption .",
    "following paper i , we have adopted a pure reflection spectrum for sources with log@xmath13=25.5 since no transmitted component is expected at this absorption level . we remind that a soft component has been considered in the input spectra of absorbed agns , parametrized with a power law with @xmath16 , normalized to be 3% of the primary de  absorbed power law at 1 kev .      in our models we fix the local ratio between absorbed and unabsorbed agns to r=4 . as discussed in paper i this value",
    "is derived by maiolino & rieke ( @xcite ) as the local ratio between seyfert 2 and seyfert 1 galaxies in the optical . since in the local universe",
    "most of the seyfert 1 galaxies are unabsorbed in the x  rays ( schartel et al .",
    "@xcite ) , r=4 can be used in the x  ray domain as well .",
    "we also adopt r=4 for high luminosity agns , although this number is uncertain .",
    "the distribution of the absorbing column densities is assumed to be that derived by risaliti , maiolino & salvati ( @xcite ) , where @xmath17 of the objects have log@xmath18 .",
    "we will explore a standard model ( model a ) where the ratio r=4 does not change with redshift and a model ( model b ) where the ratio r increases with redshift as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the redshift at which agns stop evolving .",
    "the absorption distribution is assumed not to vary with redshift and/or luminosity .",
    "the ratio r is assumed not to vary with luminosity .",
    "the contribution of unabsorbed and absorbed agns to the xrb is evaluated by integrating the xlf of unabsorbed and absorbed objects , respectively .",
    "the xlf of absorbed agns is completely unknown , while the xlf of unabsorbed agns is usually assumed to coincide with the xlf of broad line agns . as stated in the previous section , a mismatch between the optical and the x  ray classification",
    "is sometimes observed , therefore considering the xlf of broad line agns as the xlf of x  ray unabsorbed agns cound not be appropriate . in our model we refer to the xlf derived by mi00a from a sample of @xmath21 agns detected by rosat , which includes all those objects that are classified as agns , irrespectively of any distinction into type 1 and type 2 subclasses .",
    "these authors find that a luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) , where the evolution rate drops with decreasing agn luminosity , provides a good representation of the data , while a pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) or a pure density evolution ( pde ) are rejected .    although derived in the soft band , and then mainly populated by x  ray unabsorbed agns ,",
    "the xlf of mi00a is expected to include also some absorbed agns , which could show up because of their soft components or , for sources at high redshift , because of the k  correction . also , the mi00a xlf is given in the observed and not in the rest frame 0.52 kev band .",
    "we have therefore adopted the following approach to obtain a self  consistent model .",
    "first we have considered the ldde1 representation of mi00a , where we have arbitrarily modified some parameters to get a rest frame 0.52 kev xlf for unabsorbed agns only . the rest frame 0.52 kev xlfs for the agns in each absorption class of our model",
    "are then obtained by multiplying the xlf of unabsorbed agns by r@xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the fraction of agns in each absorption class according to the distribution of risaliti et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the modified xlf parameters were then tuned to obtain a good fit to the xrb by summing the contribution of unobscured and obscured agns .    once the xrb spectrum has been fitted , we calculate the _ observed _ xlf for each absorption class in our model , applying the corrections for the absorption and the k  correction .",
    "finally we sum up all the observed xlf for the individual absorption classes to derive the total observed xlf predicted by the model , which can be compared with the binned xlf data quoted by miyaji , hasinger & schmidt ( @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters of the ldde1 description ( mi00a ) which we tune in our models are @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath20 .",
    "they represent respectively the slope of the low luminosity part of the xlf , the luminosity below which the density evolution rate starts to drop , and the redshift at which the evolution stops .",
    "their values for models a and b are listed in table  1 . in model",
    "b we fixed @xmath26 and @xmath27 , therefore the two models have the same number of free parameters .",
    "following paper i , the xlf was integrated between @xmath28 erg s@xmath5 and @xmath29 .",
    "given our assumptions the xlf of absorbed agns in model b evolves according to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "the fit to the xrb spectrum is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the parameters were tuned in order to obtain the same xrb intensity at 5 kev for both models . in the 210 kev band",
    "the uncertainties in the measured level of the xrb are of the order of 3040% between different missions ( see vecchi et al .",
    "@xcite ) . we chose to fit the xrb intensity of the asca data ( miyaji et al . in preparation ; gendreau et al .",
    "@xcite ) which represent a median level among the lowest and highest intensities measured by heao1 ( gruber @xcite ; gruber et al .",
    "@xcite ) and bepposax ( vecchi et al .",
    "@xcite ) , respectively . as seen in fig .",
    "1 both models provide a good fit to the xrb spectrum and are identical in the 320 kev energy range . as in paper",
    "i , we have also added the contribution of clusters of galaxies , which is non negligible only below @xmath32 kev .",
    "given the higher fraction of absorbed agns in model b , the resulting xrb spectrum is harder than that calculated according to model a.    .model parameters compared with those of mi00a .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     then we compared the predictions of the models with the redshift distributions of agns in the 210 kev band .",
    "we consider the hard sample detected by the sis instrument in the asca large sky survey ( ueda et al .",
    "@xcite ) at a limiting flux of @xmath33 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 between 210 kev , which has been completely identified by ak00 .",
    "they find 30 agns in a sample of 34 objects ( plus 2 clusters of galaxies , 1 star and 1 unidentified source ) .",
    "these authors also estimate a column density for the agns from a hardness ratio analysis , assuming an intrinsic spectral index @xmath34 . the ratio between agns with log@xmath35 and log@xmath36 is found to be 21/9 . on the basis of their hardness ratios also 4 normal , blue and broad lined qsos with @xmath37 are considered to have log@xmath36 .",
    "the unidentified source has a very hard x  ray spectrum ( @xmath38 ) and is presumably an obscured agn .",
    "the predicted ratio n(log@xmath35)/n(log@xmath36 ) is 19/11 and 15/15 for model a and b , respectively ( the total number of agns is normalized to the observed one ) .",
    "the comparison between the observed and predicted redshift distributions for the ak00 sample is shown in fig .",
    "the probability that the sample is drawn from the calculated distributions is evaluated with a ks test and quoted in table  3 . here",
    "the two models perform equally well .",
    "we checked the role of high luminosity absorbed agns , the qso2s , by fitting the xrb only with unabsorbed agns ( at all luminosities ) and low luminosity absorbed agns .",
    "following paper i we introduced an exponential cut off in the 0.52 kev xlf of absorbed objects , where @xmath39 erg s@xmath5 is the intrinsic @xmath40folding luminosity .",
    "the ratio between absorbed and unabsorbed agns in the low luminosity regime is assumed to increase from r(0)=4 to r(@xmath20)=10 as in model b. then we tuned the parameters of the xlf in order to reproduce the xrb spectrum ( model c ) .",
    "the fit to the xrb spectrum is as good as in model b , while a major difference is seen in the hard counts ( fig .",
    "when trying to reproduce the xrb without qso2s , the 210 kev counts at relatively bright fluxes are severely underestimated ( with a significance higher than @xmath41 at @xmath42 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) , since in this case the hard xrb is mainly due to low luminosity objects showing up at faint fluxes .",
    "[ hz ]      deep surveys should allow to determine the behaviour of the agn xlf at high redshift . from optical and radio surveys a decline above @xmath9 is observed , while from x  ray surveys a constant density above @xmath10 is not ruled out ( see fig .  11 in mi00a ) .",
    "in the previous calculations we assumed that the density of agns is constant in the range from @xmath43 to @xmath44 and then it suddenly drops to zero .",
    "now , starting from model b , we consider the following scenarios . in the first case ( model d )",
    "we assume that the agns density above @xmath45 decreases by a factor 2.7 per unit redshift as found for optical qsos by schmidt et al .",
    "( @xcite ; see also fan et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the second case ( model e )",
    "we assume that the agns density is constant up to z=10 .",
    "model d provides a better description of the overall x  ray constraints ( hard xrb spectrum , soft and hard counts , soft and hard redshift distributions ) than model e. in particular the chandra data are better accounted for in model d , since high redshift ( low fluxes ) agns are removed from the model .",
    "the real behaviour of the agn density at high redshift will be proven when complete optical identification of deep surveys will be available .",
    "we calculated the redshift distribution predicted by model d and e at @xmath46 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , the limiting flux of the 0.52 kev sample in mushotzky et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which is also very close to the limiting flux of the 0.52 kev sample in giacconi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the percentage of agns above @xmath47 expected from model d and e are significantly different : 0.7% and 15% , respectively .",
    "the total agn density at @xmath48 is 16 deg@xmath49 for model d and 500 deg@xmath49 for model e. the haiman & loeb ( @xcite ) model predicts about 500 deg@xmath49 agns at @xmath48 for the same band and limiting flux .",
    "in this work some changes have been made in the model assumptions with respect to paper i. the weakening of the soft excess component slightly hardens the xrb spectrum and increases the 210 kev counts by less than 10% . in general , our results are not significantly affected by the precise parametrization of the soft excess . the compton scattering correction in the spectra of absorbed agns with log@xmath13=24.5 reduces by 1015% the intensity of the xrb at 30 kev .",
    "the corrections for the instrumental effects ( see the appendix ) are relevant on the expected ratio between absorbed and unabsorbed agns in different surveys , but do not affect the expected total surface density of agns . the major change , instead , concerns high luminosity obscured agns , the qso2s , which are now assumed to constitute a large population of sources .    as already recognized by comastri ( @xcite ) and as shown in fig",
    "7 , qso2s are fundamental in reproducing the asca counts . in model c",
    "we arbitrarily assume @xmath50 erg s@xmath5 as the intrinsic e  folding luminosity in the 0.52 kev xlf of absorbed agns . objects with this luminosity could still be considered in the seyfert luminosity domain . if we very conservatively assume @xmath51 erg s@xmath5 , corresponding to a bolometric luminosity higher than @xmath52 erg s@xmath5 ( elvis et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the 210 kev counts at @xmath42 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 are still underestimated with a significance higher than @xmath53 . as shown in fig .  5 and 6 , the existence and the assumed abundance of qso2s are consistent with the agn redshift distributions observed in rosat and asca surveys .",
    "the nature and the number of obscured qsos is still debated . in paper",
    "i , under the assumption that the absorbed x  ray photons are re  emitted as infrared photons , we estimated that , if every ultraluminous infrared galaxy is powered by an agn and is therefore considered as a qso2 , the ratio qso2s / qsos in the local universe is at most 2 .",
    "this upper limit could be relaxed if a fraction of the x  ray absorbed objects have normal blue and broad lined spectrum in the optical ( reeves & turner @xcite ; ak00 ; fiore et al .",
    "radio loud qsos were already found to be x  ray absorbed , and the x  ray weakness of broad absorption lines qsos has also been interpreted as due to x  ray absorption ( brandt et al .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore ,",
    "a large population of x  ray absorbed , broad lined qsos with a red continuum seems to emerge from the analysis of grism based surveys ( risaliti et al .",
    "@xcite ) which would join the population of radio selected red qsos discovered by webster et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . however , given the uncertainties affecting the x  ray spectra of these sources , xmm observations are necessary to confirm the existence of a population of broad lined , x  ray absorbed qsos .",
    "on the other hand , examples of qsos obscured both in the optical band and in the x rays could be represented by a few rosat sources in the lockman hole with very red colours ( @xmath8 , hasinger et al .",
    "this might suggest that the central agn is heavily obscured and we are observing the colours of the host galaxy . as shown by hasinger",
    "( @xcite ) , one of these sources , which has been observed from radio to x rays , shows a spectral energy distribution remarkably similar to that of the luminous absorbed agn ngc6240 ( vignati et al .",

    "overall the number of qso2s is not yet established , for simplicity we fixed the local ratio between absorbed and unabsorbed qsos to 4 as in the case of lower luminosity agns .    as it is apparent from tab .  2",
    ", a model where the evolution of absorbed agns is faster than that of unabsorbed ones provides a better representation of the main x  ray observational constraints . by summing the @xmath54 of the 0.52 kev xlf , 0.52 kev logn  logs and 210 kev logn ",
    "logs , the improvement of model b with respect to model a is significant at @xmath55 confidence level ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "now we discuss some uncertainties which could affect the significance of this result . a first problem could be represented by the xrb normalization . since there are variations of about 40% in the 210 kev xrb intensity measurements ( see e.g. vecchi et al .",
    "@xcite ) , fitting different xrb intensities would lead to different predictions for the number counts in the soft and hard band .",
    "we fitted the xrb intensity measured by asca , which represents a median level between the highest measurement performed by bepposax ( vecchi et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the lowest one performed by heao1 a2 ( gruber @xcite ; gruber et al .",
    "we note that the data from the a2 he d experiment on board heao1 seem to be lower by @xmath57 not only with respect to the asca xrb data , but also with respect to the high energy data measured by the a4 led experiment ( see fig .  2 in gruber et al .",
    "@xcite ) . thus ,",
    "a miscalibration of @xmath57 of the a2 he d data could account for the some of the systematic differences of intensity in the xrb measurements .    in fitting the 210 kev xrb intensity measured by heao1 a2 by changing the free parameters of the models ( see tab .",

    "the fast evolution model would provide a better agreement with the data .",
    "also in the case of a fit to the xrb intensity measured by bepposax model b provides a better description of the data when compared to model a.    a second problem could arise from the choices made in the @xmath54 tests performed on the logn  logs . when dealing with the 0.52 kev logn",
    "logs we have compared the agn densities predicted by the models with those measured by rosat . since for the chandra data the optical identifications are sparse , we compared the predictions of the model with the total number of sources .",
    "we note that in our models the cluster contribution at the chandra fluxes is negligible .",
    "however , if other classes of sources are contributing to the chandra counts and the agns counts are significantly lower than the total ones , model b would always provide a better representation of the data .    when considering the 210 kev logn ",
    "logs we compared the data with the total density of objects ( agn plus clusters of galaxies ) predicted by the models , since optical identifications are incomplete for most of the adopted datasets .",
    "we note however that our models are in agreement with the separate measurements of the agn and cluster densities determined by piccinotti et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and ak00 .",
    "we consider it appropriate to compare the total source density measured by the different surveys in the 210 kev band with the agn + cluster model predictions , since @xmath60 of the sources in the ak00 sample are agns or clusters .",
    "we note that without the correction for the asca instrumental response the ratio n(log@xmath35)/n(log@xmath36 ) predicted by model b for the ak00 sample would have been 12/18 rather than 15/15 .",
    "as pointed out by comastri ( @xcite ) , in previous synthesis models the number of unabsorbed agns predicted at the asca fluxes seemed to be in disagreement with that observed . when considering instrumental effects much of the discrepancy can thus be explained .    after the discovery of hard x  ray spectra in a small sample of nearby elliptical galaxies ( allen , di matteo & fabian @xcite ) it was proposed by di matteo & allen ( @xcite ) that a substantial fraction of the xrb intensity could arise from advection dominated flows in elliptical galaxies . however , in this case elliptical galaxies with normal optical spectra should represent a significant fraction of the 210 kev asca counts , at variance with the findings of ak00 .",
    "our models are found to be in good agreement with the agn redshift distributions in the soft and hard bands , as checked with the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov tests . also , they are in agreement with the relative fraction of absorbed agns found in flux limited samples . a possible discrepancy could be recognized in the ratio between agns with log@xmath35 and log@xmath36 observed in the ak00 sample and that predicted by model b. however , this is only a @xmath61 effect .",
    "also , the column density estimated by ak00 from the hardness ratio analysis assuming a simple absorbed power law model could have been underestimated if a soft component is commonly present in the spectra of absorbed agns , as assumed in our models .",
    "this is likely to be the case , as shown by the x  ray color  color diagrams for asca and bepposax sources ( della ceca et al .",
    "@xcite ; fiore et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "our models slightly overpredict the chandra source counts in the soft band , and probably also in the hard band ( referring to the data of giacconi et al .",
    "@xcite ) . introducing a cut off at @xmath45 in the agn density as observed in the optical surveys would provide a better description of the chandra data , since high redshift agns which would show up at faint fluxes would be removed .",
    "the improvement introduced by model b with respect to model a resides essentially in the higher fraction of hard sources and in the lower value of @xmath20 . in order to avoid introducing other free parameters we assumed that the value of @xmath20 is the same for absorbed and unabsorbed agns .",
    "however , we note that a still better fit to the x  ray constraints could be obtained if a lower @xmath20 for absorbed agns were used . indeed",
    ", this would imply that a higher fraction of the hard xrb is produced at small redshift , with an increase of the hard counts at the asca fluxes and a decrease at the chandra fluxes .",
    "also , the xrb bump at @xmath62 kev would be better reproduced since the agn spectral peak at 3040 kev would be on the average less redshifted .",
    "another improvement is expected in the redshift distributions .",
    "we note that the @xmath13 distribution adopted in our models , derived by risaliti et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for a local sample of agns , is very similar ( see fig .  1 of paper i ) , which however do not contribute significantly to the xrb intensity . ] to that used by comastri et al .",
    "( @xcite ) _ to fit _ the xrb spectrum , which is mostly produced by objects at higher redshift .",
    "it thus seems that it would be difficult to obtain good xrb fits with @xmath13 distributions which are very different from the adopted one .",
    "furthermore , this argument suggests that a fast evolution of absorbed sources would be hardly superseded in improving the description of x  ray data by simply changing the @xmath13 distribution with redshift .",
    "the significance of a faster evolution of absorbed agns might be reduced by systematic uncertainties in the adopted data and further checks with the data from on going deep surveys are needed .",
    "if the higher fraction of absorbed agns at high redshift is proven to be real , one could try to link this finding to the star formation history in the universe .",
    "a higher merging rate at high redshift could trigger the star formation and the gas flow towards the galaxy centers . as suggested by fabian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , circumnuclear starbursts could obscure most of the nuclear radiation . in this scheme , the higher fraction of obscured sources at high redshift could be explained .",
    "this can also be related with the finding that non  axisymmetric",
    "morphologies increase the obscuration in agns ( maiolino , risaliti & salvati @xcite ) , and that distorted , non  axisymmetric morphologies are more common among galaxies at high redshift .",
    "we have presented different synthesis models for the xrb , checking the model predictions with all the available x  ray constraints posed by the source counts , xlf , redshift distributions and absorption distributions .",
    "models assuming a population of high luminosity obscured agns , the qso2s , are found to be consistent with all the available data .",
    "furthermore , the existence of qso2s is found to be necessary in reproducing the 210 kev source counts at relatively bright fluxes ( @xmath63 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) .",
    "we found that a model ( model b ) where the evolution of absorbed agns is faster than that of unabsorbed ones provides a better description of the data with respect to a standard model ( model a ) where absorbed and unabsorbed agns evolve with the same rate .",
    "our models are also in agreement with the first results from chandra deep surveys .",
    "chandra sources , together with those detected in xmm deep surveys , will provide additional informations on the qso2 population and will verify if the faster evolution of absorbed agns is real .",
    "furthermore , the behaviour of the agn space density at high redshift will be determined when optical identification programs will be completed .",
    "we are grateful to t. miyaji for providing data on the xrb spectrum and agn xlf , and to p. tozzi for providing data on the chandra counts .",

    "this work was partly supported by the italian space agency ( asi ) under grant ars98116/22 and by the italian ministry for university and research ( murst ) under grant cofin980232 .",
    "to allow a consistent comparison between the logn  logs and redshift distributions predicted by the models and the literature data , we have taken into account the bias against absorbed sources introduced by the effective area of the x  ray instruments .",
    "we describe the procedure adopted when comparing the model predictions with the 0.52 kev agn logn",
    " logs , which is mainly derived from rosat pspc data .",
    "this procedure is analogous to that adopted when considering data from other x  ray instruments . for each absorption class considered in the models we have produced with the xspec package a spectrum identical to that considered in the model .",
    "the obtained spectra have been folded with the rosat pspc spectral response .",
    "we adopted the calibration file pspcb_gain2_256.rsp retrieved from the archive in the ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/ website .",
    "the file contains the spectral response of the pspc detector multiplied by the x  ray telescope effective area .",
    "we therefore obtained a count rate to flux conversion factor cf@xmath64 for each of the agn spectra assumed in our model .",
    "the spectra have also been redshifted and the conversion factors calculated as a function of redshift .",
    "when deriving the agn 0.52 kev xlf and counts mi00a assumed a power law with @xmath65 ( absorbed by a galactic column density ) to convert from the 0.52 kev pspc count rate to the 0.52 kev flux , corresponding to a conversion factor cf@xmath66 cts s@xmath5/ ( @xmath67 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) ( see tab .  2 in hasinger et al .",
    "the conversion factor cf@xmath68 was used for all the sources , irrespectively of their real spectrum .",
    "however , sources with a spectrum harder than @xmath65 would produce less photons on the detector at a given flux , therefore a conversion factor lower than cf@xmath68 should be used .",
    "analogously , for those sources softer than @xmath65 a conversion factor greater that cf@xmath68 should be used . then , a source with a measured flux s would have a real flux s@xmath69(cf@xmath68/cf ) , where cf is the conversion factor which would be appropriate for the source spectrum .",
    "therefore , in our calculations of the logn  logs , at a given flux s we summed the contribution of each absorption class of the model calculated at s@xmath69(cf@xmath68/cf@xmath64 ) .    the same procedure has been adopted for the 210 kev logn  logs and redshift distribution at s=@xmath33 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , which have been corrected for the asca sis0 plus x  ray mirror effective area ( calibration file s0c1g0234p40e1_512_1av0_8i.rsp ) .",
    "for the 210 kev band we adopted cf@xmath70 cts s@xmath5/ ( @xmath71 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) , corresponding to @xmath34 . indeed , a conversion spectrum with @xmath72 is commonly adopted in the hard x  ray surveys ( e.g. ak00 ; cagnoni et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the redshift distribution of the 0.52 kev agns calculated at s=@xmath73 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5",
    "we have considered the corrections for the hri spectral response and x  ray mirror effective area contained in hri_90dec01.rsp .",
    "we adopted cf@xmath74 cts s@xmath5/ ( @xmath67 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) , which is the conversion factor from the 0.12.4 kev hri cont rate to the 0.52 kev flux appropriate for a spectral power law with @xmath65 ."
