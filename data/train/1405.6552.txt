    "quantum computation is believed to be more powerful than classical computation .",
    "there are quantum algorithms that efficiently solve a problem for which no efficient classical algorithm is known so far , such as the shor s algorithm  @xcite , an algorithm for pell s equation and the principal ideal problems  @xcite , and an algorithm for approximate solutions of knot invariants  @xcite .",
    "however , it has not been yet fully understood what makes quantum computation more powerful than classical one .",
    "one approach to address this question is to investigate whether or not quantum computation described by circuits comprising a restricted class of quantum gates still outperform classical computation .",
    "from this perspective , it has been shown that , if the gates are restricted to those generating a little amount of entanglement  @xcite or so - called matchgates acting on nearest neighbor qubits  @xcite , quantum computation is efficiently simulated by classical computers .",
    "quantum computation by diagonal quantum circuits in the computational basis with a separable initial state , which are often called _ instantaneous quantum polynomial - time ( iqp ) _ circuits , is also attracting much attention  @xcite .",
    "a study of diagonal quantum circuits is motivated by a fact that they are rather classical in the sense that all gates commute each other .",
    "hence , they are suited for investigating the boarder of quantum and classical computational power .",
    "since noncommutativity of operators is one of the significant features of classical theory , one may expect that diagonal quantum circuits would not outperform classical computers .",
    "this natural expectation is however likely to be incorrect . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that iqp circuits are not classically simulatable under the assumption that the polynomial hierarchy ( ph ) does not collapse at the third level , which is a highly plausible assumption in computational complexity theory . such computational power of iqp circuits is intuitively related to a fact that a quantum circuit diagonal in the computational basis can generate highly entangled state by choosing an appropriate separable initial state .",
    "in fact , almost all states generated by iqp circuits are extremely entangled  @xcite .",
    "these results clarify the distinction between quantum and classical computational power , and give an insight that quantum theory is not necessarily reduced to classical one by imposing only commutativity of operators .",
    "diagonal quantum circuits also have a practical importance since they are experimentally much simpler to realize and less sensitive to decoherence than non - diagonal quantum circuits .",
    "diagonal gates are fault - tolerantly realizable even by current technology , for instance , in superconducting and semiconducting systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the commutativity of all gates in a diagonal quantum circuit allows us to implement the circuit by a single time - independent commuting hamiltonian .",
    "in such an implementation by a hamiltonian dynamics , a control of the order of interactions is not necessary since all interactions can be simultaneously applied due to their commutativity , so that it significantly reduces practical time to perform computation and makes the implementation more robust . for these reasons ,",
    "it is worth studying what diagonal quantum circuits can perform beyond classical information processing , which directly provides experimentally realizable quantum tasks by currently available technology .    in spite of their computational power and practical merits of diagonal quantum circuits ,",
    "little is known about concrete applications of diagonal quantum circuits so far .",
    "one of the applications of quantum diagonal circuits is a generation of _ random states _ , which are an ensemble of pure states uniformly distributed in a hilbert space with respect to the unitarily invariant measure .",
    "random states have many utilities in a wide range of applications in quantum information processing such as quantum communicational tasks  @xcite , efficient measurements  @xcite , an algorithmic use  @xcite and an estimation of gate fidelities  @xcite .",
    "however , generating random states requires exponential resource since the number of parameters in random states scales exponentially with the number of qubits .",
    "hence , efficient generations of approximate random states , called a _ state @xmath0-design _ , have been intensely studied  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-design of an ensemble is another ensemble that simulates up to the @xmath0th - order statistical moments of the original one  @xcite .",
    "a state @xmath0-design can be approximately but efficiently generated by a quantum circuit  @xcite and can be used instead of random states in many applications  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that non - diagonal gates are not necessary for generating a state design by presenting a way of approximately generating a state @xmath0-design by diagonal quantum circuits .",
    "although the degree of approximation is small but constant and can not be improved by applying additional diagonal gates in general , it was also shown that a state @xmath1-design can be exactly generated by combining a diagonal quantum circuit with a classical random procedure  @xcite .",
    "these results are practically useful since they provide a concrete application of diagonal quantum circuits in quantum informational tasks exploiting a state @xmath0-design .",
    "this allows us to experimentally demonstrate quantum advantages .",
    "this paper aims to review the results on diagonal quantum circuits in terms of their computational power and applications .",
    "it is organized as follows .",
    "the computational power of diagonal quantum circuits is summarized in sect .",

    "we define the computational basis by tensor products of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , and denote it by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a binary representation of @xmath17 . throughout the paper",
    ", we study diagonal quantum circuits in the computational basis , so that we do not refer to the basis in the following .",
    "we review results on the computational power of diagonal quantum circuits mainly obtained in refs .  @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ ssec : comclass ] , we provide a very brief introduction of some complexity classes , which will be used in the following subsections . the results of computational complexity on iqp circuits are summarized in sect .",
    "[ ssec : iqp ] .",
    "we briefly explain computational complexity classes for decision problems , which are the problems with yes - or - no answers .",
    "we overview only the complexity classes related to an investigation of iqp circuits . for more details , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we first explain complexity classes called _ polynomial - time ( p ) _ and _ nondeterministic polynomial - time ( np)_. the class p is a class of the problems solvable in polynomial time by classical computers . the class np is problems with the following properties : if the answer is yes , there exists a proof of polynomial length to confirm this fact that can be verified in p , and if the answer is no , all proofs purported to that the answer is yes are rejected in p. the class p is clearly included in np , but it has not been shown whether the inclusion is strict or not . from the complexity classes",
    "p and np , a _ polynomial hierarchy ( ph ) _ is defined based on an idea of oracle machines . a class @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) in the hierarchy",
    "are recursively defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the non - deterministic class associated with @xmath18 , e.g. , @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 is a set of problems that are in @xmath25 if an oracle belonging to a complexity class @xmath22 is allowed to use . since one use of an oracle",
    "is counted as one step , @xmath24 is expected to to be much harder than @xmath22 although it has not been proven .",
    "a complexity class ph is then defined by the union of all classes @xmath18 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to a deterministic feature of p , np and ph in the sense that the computation is deterministically performed , there are probabilistic complexity classes . in particular , two classes _ bounded - error probabilistic polynomial - time ( bpp ) _ and _ probabilistic polynomial - time ( pp ) _ are important for investigating iqp circuits .",
    "the problems in bpp can be solved probabilistically in polynomial time , where the probability of obtaining a correct answer should be greater than or equal to @xmath26 . if the probability of obtaining a correct answer is relaxed to be strictly greater than @xmath27 , the class of the problems is called pp .",
    "the distinction between bpp and pp is whether or not the lower bound of the probability that the algorithm provides a correct answer , which should be strictly greater than @xmath27 , can depend on the input size . for bpp",
    ", the probability @xmath26 can be replaced with an arbitrary @xmath28 as long as it is constant , which enables us to amplify the probability arbitrary close to 1 by running the algorithm polynomially many times . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower bound of the probability is possibly dependent on the input size for pp , e.g. , @xmath29 .",
    "hence , bpp is a subclass of pp .    for quantum computation",
    ", we explain only _ bounded - error quantum polynomial - time ( bqp ) _  @xcite , which is a quantum version of bpp .",
    "formally , bqp is a class of problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time , where the probability to obtain a correct answer is greater than or equal to @xmath26 .",
    "the class bqp includes bpp and p , and is included in pp  @xcite , so that p @xmath30 bpp @xmath30",
    "bqp @xmath30 pp . although the relation between bqp and np is not exactly known , there is an evidence that bqp is not included in ph  @xcite , implying that bqp is likely to be not included in np .",
    "see also fig .",
    "[ fig : cc ]    finally , we introduce computational classes with a post - selection . for every probabilistic computational class @xmath31",
    ", its post - selected version can be defined by allowing a post - selection , which is simply denoted by post - a , e.g. , post - bpp , post - pp , and post - bqp .",
    "although a post - selection may not be realistic , it helps an investigation of relations between different complexity classes for which a post - selection is not allowed .",
    "instantaneous quantum polynomial - time ( iqp ) circuits are quantum circuits comprising only diagonal gates in the computational basis with a separable initial state and measurement in a separable basis . in spite of the commutativity of diagonal gates , they have quantum features if the initial state and the measurement basis are appropriately chosen .",
    "the definition of iqp circuits is given by the following .",
    "_ an iqp circuit for @xmath2 qubits is a quantum circuit with the following structure : each gate in the circuit is diagonal in the pauli-@xmath4 basis , the input state is @xmath32 , and the output is the result of a measurement in the pauli-@xmath5 basis on a specified set of output qubits . _    a complexity class related to iqp circuits is simply denoted by iqp .",

    "_    although it is clear that strong simulatability implies weak one , their difference is large since there exist quantum circuit families that are classically weakly simulatable but its exact strong simulation is in a complexity class @xmath35-complete  @xcite , which is strongly believed to be a much harder than p. as the exact simulation of quantum circuits is too restrictive , an approximate simulation is also introduced in terms of a multiplicative error for a weak simulation of quantum circuits , e.g. , in ref .",
    "a circuit family @xmath33 is weakly simulatable with a multiplicative error @xmath36 if there is a sampling method according to the probability distribution @xmath37 , where @xmath38 the following theorem is about classical simulatability of iqp circuits .",

    "this is the case even for iqp circuits with two - qubit gates .",
    "_    the proof of theorem  [ thm : iqphard ] relies on an investigation of a post - selected version of iqp circuits .",
    "it was first shown that if a post - selection is allowed , computational power of iqp circuits is equal to that of bqp .",
    "this is interesting in itself since it implies that a post - selection closes the gap between diagonal and non - diagonal circuits .",
    "the computational power of post - bqp is also known to be equal to pp  @xcite , resulting in a relation that @xmath41 moreover , under the assumption that iqp circuits are weakly classically simulatable as stated in theorem  [ thm : iqphard ] , it was shown that post - iqp @xmath30 post - bpp . this relation and eq .",

    "@xcite for the full detail ) .    since it is highly implausible that ph @xmath40 , theorem  [ thm : iqphard ] implies that iqp circuits are highly unlikely to be weakly simulatable by classical computers .",
    "one intuitive understanding of this computational power of iqp circuits is obtained by studying the properties of states that appear during the computation by iqp circuits .",
    "although iqp circuits are capable to use only a restricted ensemble of states due to the commutativity of all gates and a fixed separable initial state , it was shown that such an ensemble of states covers the whole hilbert space fairly uniformly in the sense that the ensemble is hard to be distinguished from the uniformly distributed states in the hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "consequently , a state generated by an iqp circuit is typically highly entangled  @xcite .",
    "these results are shown in the formulation of a @xmath0-design of random states , which we will explain in more detail in sects .",
    "[ ssec : rmrs ] and  [ sssec : approx ] .",
    "a fact that iqp circuits can exploit such a uniformly distributied states in a hilbert space indicates that the outputs of the circuits should typically have quantum features in spite of the commutativity of all gates , and is expected to result in the computational power exceeding the classical one .",
    "although theorem  [ thm : iqphard ] shows that there is no universal classical method to simulate an output distribution of _ any _ iqp circuits , it is also interesting to address a question _ what types of iqp circuits are classically simulatable_. this question is partially answered by mapping the output probability distribution to the partition function of the ising models with imaginary coupling constants on an associated graph  @xcite .",
    "the following theorem is obtained by investigating whether or not the partition function of the mapped ising model is exactly computed :    [ thm : csiqp ] _ if iqp circuits are sufficiently sparse , or if iqp circuits contain only two - qubit gates of the form @xmath46 $ ] acting on nearest - neighbor qubits @xmath47 on a two - dimensional graph , then the iqp circuits are classically simulatable in a strong sense . _    the condition of the sparse property in theorem  [ thm : csiqp ] is given by an associated graph of iqp circuits , which is obtained by identifying qubits and diagonal gates in the circuit with vertices and hyperedges on a graph . if the associated graph is an _ independent and full rank bipartite ( ifrb ) _",

    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm;csiqp ] implies that there exist iqp circuits that are easy to classically simulate .",

    "@xcite , the method developed in the paper , mapping an output probability distribution of iqp circuits to the partition function of the ising models , works in general and will provide a good tool for studying classical simulatability of iqp circuits .",
    "+ theorems  [ thm : iqphard ] and  [ thm : csiqp ] imply that iqp circuits show both classical and quantum computational power depending on the detailed structure of the circuits and that their computational power is on the border of classical and quantum ones .",
    "thus , iqp circuits will provide a good framework to address a question what property of quantum circuits distinguishes quantum from classical in terms of computational power .",
    "although this question can be addressed by investigating non - diagonal quantum circuits , iqp circuits are probably more suitable since they have a much simpler structure than non - diagonal ones .",
