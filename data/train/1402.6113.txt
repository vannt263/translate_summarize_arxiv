    "silicene is a monolayer of silicon atoms@xcite , forming a buckled honeycomb structure @xcite . it does not occur naturally but it has been synthesized on metal surfaces@xcite .",
    "its low energy band structure is similar to graphene with two inequivalent valleys at the dirac points .",
    "by contrast to graphene , it has large spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) being more pronounced in silicon than in carbon@xcite , which induces a gap of 3.9mev , for graphene this gap is around 24@xmath0ev@xcite .",
    "this significant soi gives rise to two important phenomena .",
    "first , by opening the gap , it provides mass to the dirac fermions@xcite .",
    "second , it spin - splits the bands in each valley@xcite .",
    "the latter property makes possible the manipulation of the spin degree of freedom , in addition to the valley degree of freedom , with possible applications in spintronics .",
    "further , the gap in silicene is tunable by applying an external uniform electric field @xmath1 perpendicular to the silicene sheet@xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that silicene shows a number of topologically protected phases , when subjected to the field @xmath1@xcite .",
    "more importantly for this work , @xmath1-field breaks the space inversion ( si ) symmetry of the system .",
    "hence the berry curvature is finite and sharply peaked at the two valleys .",
    "this gives rise to nontrivial topological electric transport phenomena .",
    "in graphene , it led to the prediction of valley hall effect @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the berry phase effects on another class of transport coefficients , the thermoelectric transport coefficients .",
    "our main focus is on topological nernst effect .",
    "this berry phase mediated nernst effect exists independent of an external magnetic field .",
    "prior to our work and relevant to it , there has been investigation of nernst effect in gapped single and bilayer graphene@xcite based on berry phase formulation developed earlier@xcite . in both gapped graphene systems ,",
    "the nernst effect is valley dependent and can lead to valley polarization .",
    "by contrast in silicene , we will show that nernst effect is valley as well as spin dependent .",
    "therefore , in a generic nernst measurement set up it can be used to generate valley as well as spin polarization which can have important technological implications .    the main question that we address , in this work , is the valley and spin tunability of the nernst effect by an applied electric field .",
    "a related question is the ability to generate valley and spin polarization in silicene .",
    "these questions are important because silicene has rich physics , a variety of different phases@xcite , and compatability with present silicon microelectronics .",
    "further , it has been recently shown that that the figure of merit which quantifies the thermoelectric effeciency of a material is much higher for silicene compared to graphene@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is believed , that silicene can be a better option for electrically tunable thermoelectric devices than graphene@xcite .",
    "silicene has a honeycomb structure of silicon atoms on sublattice sites a and b displaced from each other by a distance 2@xmath2 the graphene - like low energy effective hamiltonian of silicene , in the presence of soi and subjected to a perpendicular @xmath1-field around dirac point within each valley , can be expressed around the @xmath3 point as@xcite @xmath4 where , @xmath5 for @xmath6 dirac points ( valley index ) , @xmath7 , with _ _",
    "l__=0.23a , @xmath8 are pauli matrices , @xmath9  is the fermi velocity of dirac fermions and ( @xmath10 are the components of the wave vector relative to the dirac point . the spin index @xmath11 for spin up @xmath12  and down @xmath13  respectively . in the absence of any @xmath14 nonconserving terms in the hamiltonian , one can simply consider the two @xmath15 subspaces corresponding to @xmath16 separately .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian , arises from nearest neighbour hopping and is the dirac term , well known from studies in graphene .",
    "the second term is the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction term ( kane and mele term ) with spin - orbit gap of @xmath17 the third term is due to the uniform perpendicular electric field @xmath1 with the electric field induced gap @xmath18 it generates a staggered sublattice potential between the sites a and b.    the hamiltonian can be diagonalized analytically , and its energy spectrum is@xmath19 where + ( - ) solution is for electron(hole ) bands .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , our model hamiltonian eq.(1 ) contains an external tunable parameter @xmath20 , which can be tuned relative to @xmath21 .",
    "so we have three possible situations : @xmath20 is less than @xmath21 , @xmath20  is equal to @xmath21  and @xmath20  is greater than @xmath21 . the energy dispersion , eq .",
    "( 2 ) , for the three cases is presented in fig.(1a ) , fig.(1b ) and fig.(1c ) .",
    "the eigenvectors for electron and hole states in @xmath22valley are @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24.$ ] @xmath25 and @xmath26 here .",
    "the states in @xmath27 valley are time - reversed conjugates of the above states@xmath28    at this stage , it is necessary to discuss symmetry of our system because it dictates whether berry curvature is finite and nonzero or not .",
    "this is important because topological transport will survive only when berry curvature does not vanish at all points in the momentum space .",
    "berry curvature is an odd function of @xmath29 in the presence of time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry and an even function in the presence of space inversion ( si ) symmetry@xcite . if both these symmetries are present , berry curvature vanishes at all points in momentum space .",
    "the @xmath20 term explicitely breaks si symmetry , see eq.(1)@xcite .",
    "the tr symmetry when both the dirac points is considered is intact . in this case ,",
    "berry curvature is finite and nontrivial which will have profound consequences for transport in the system . from the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and the eigenvectors , the berry curvature for the conduction band ( electrons ) , can be found : @xmath30 note that berry curvature has opposite signs in the two valleys for opposite spins as required by tr symmetry : @xmath31 and @xmath32    in an important study on valley contrasting physics in graphene@xcite , it was found that one of the properties that distinguishes valley degree of freedom is the magnetic moment .",
    "it is of orbital nature since soi is weak in graphene .",
    "it depends on the valley index and can be used to create valley polarization in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "by contrast to graphene , soi is relatively large in silicene .",
    "it spin splits the bands in silicene@xcite .",
    "therefore , in silicene , the bloch fermions carry the spin magnetic moment in addition to the orbital magnetic moment which originates from the self rotation of their wave packet .",
    "it is important to note that valley magnetic moment in silicene has both valley and spin character .",
    "the orbital magnetic moment can be obtained from a semi - classical formulation of wave - packet dynamics and is given by@xcite @xmath33   \\left\\vert \\overrightarrow{\\nabla}_{q}u(q)\\right\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath34  is the periodic part of the bloch function , @xmath35  is the bloch hamiltonian and @xmath36  is band dispersion . in analogy with graphene , since it depends on the valley index , it can be called the valley magnetic moment ( vmm ) .",
    "but we must remember that in silicene , unlike graphene , it is also a spin dependent quantity . for a 2d sheet",
    "the vmm is always normal to the plane .",
    "it comes out to be@xmath37 it is concentrated at the dirac points in the valleys .",
    "furthermore , the vmm of the two valleys depends on the valley index . at the bottom of the band , where @xmath38 , and for the parameters @xmath39mev and @xmath40 m/s",
    ",  the vmm is about twice that of graphene ( it is 63.78@xmath41 for silicene whereas for graphene it is 30@xmath41 ) .",
    "this means , by contrast to graphene , we expect a stronger response in silicene to an applied perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "an applied magnetic field will couple to the valley magnetic moment . a net valley polarization , more moments in one valley compared to the other ( population difference ) , will be achieved .",
    "the result is that an enhanced pauli paramagnetism like phenomena with larger net magnetization is expected compared to graphene@xcite .",
    "therefore , silicene is a better option to realize valley as well as spin polarization than graphene .",
    "to determine the nernst effect , we will proceed in two directions .",
    "first , we will determine the charge hall conductivity and using the mott relation arrive at the nernst conductivity @xmath42 .",
    "this has the advantage that one can find an analytic expression for @xmath42 .",
    "the drawback is that the result is restricted to low temperature .",
    "the second approach is to employ the berry formalism to compute the nernst conductivity using the entropy density of the system . in this approach ,",
    "one usually can not obtain analytic results at finite temperature because of the fermi function integrals . at the end numerical integration",
    "is required .    *",
    "valley hall conductivity : * we will begin with the first approach that requires calculating the charge hall conductivity .",
    "this we can do by employing the berry phase formalism .",
    "we are ignoring impurity scattering here and consider only the intrinsic contribution . in the presence of an in - plane electric field ,",
    "fermions acquire anomalous velocity proportional to the berry curvature that gives rise to the intrinsic hall conductivity@xcite . for a particular valley ( say @xmath43 and band @xmath44 , the valley hall conductivity ( vhc )",
    "is given by @xmath45\\ ] ] where @xmath46  is the fermi - dirac distribution function for band @xmath44 , spin @xmath47 in valley @xmath48 .",
    "in silicene , this depends on the valley index @xmath48 , where @xmath49 in the above equation , as well as the spin index @xmath50 the total valley hall conductivity is the sum over all occupied bands for both valleys .",
    "we have determined the vhc , @xmath51 when the chemical potential @xmath0 is placed in the band gap , between the two spin split conduction bands ( one band partially occupied ) and above the bottom of both the conduction bands ( both bands are partially occupied ) for the following two cases : @xmath20 @xmath52 @xmath21 and @xmath20 @xmath53 @xmath54 the results , obtained from eq.(6 ) , are shown in the following table ( 1):@xmath55{|c|c|c|}\\hline $ \\mu$ & $ \\delta_{z}$ % tcimacro{\\textsymbol { < } } % % beginexpansion $ < $ % endexpansion $ \\delta_{so}$ & $ \\delta_{z}$ % tcimacro{\\textsymbol { > } } % % beginexpansion $ > $ % endexpansion $ \\delta_{so}$\\\\\\hline in the band gap & $ 0 $ & $ -\\frac{e^{2}}{h}$\\\\\\hline between spin split bands & $ -\\frac{e^{2}}{2h}\\left [   1-\\frac{\\left ( \\delta_{so}-\\delta_{z}\\right )   } { \\mu}\\right ]   $ & $ -\\frac{e^{2}}{2h}\\left [ 1-\\frac{\\left (   \\delta_{so}-\\delta_{z}\\right )   } { \\mu}\\right ]   $ \\\\\\hline above the bottom of both bands & $ -\\frac{e^{2}}{2h}\\left (   \\frac{2\\delta_{z}% } { \\mu}\\right )   $ & $ -\\frac{e^{2}}{2h}\\left (   \\frac{2\\delta_{z}}{\\mu}\\right ) $ \\\\\\hline \\end{tabular } \\ \\ \\ \\\\ ] ] these results highlight two important points .",
