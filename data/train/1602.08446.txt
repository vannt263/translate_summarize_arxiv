    "in long term evolution ( lte ) , heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) are viewed as an attractive approach for expanding mobile network capacity as well as alleviating the traffic burden @xcite . in a hetnet , both overlaying macro cells ( mcs ) and underlying small cells ( scs ) are deployed .",
