    "it is well known that many problems dealing with reflections from multilayered media can be solved using the transmission line analogy when the eigen - polarizations are studied separately ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this case , the amplitudes of tangential electric and magnetic fields are treated as equivalent _ scalar _ voltages and currents in the equivalent transmission line section . in order to account for an arbitrary polarization , lindell and alanen introduced a _ vector _",
