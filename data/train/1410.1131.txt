    "similar to bubble chambers , tpcs allow 3-d reconstruction of ionization distributions in large volumes . traditionally , one limitation of the tpc has been that unless the time when ionization occurred is known , the detector only measures relative , not absolute position in the drift direction , @xmath1 .",

    "spatially , the chip plane is segmented into @xmath12 pixels of @xmath13 , arranged in a rectangular grid of 336 rows and 80 columns , dense enough to resolve the @xmath14  mm typical width of drifted electron clouds in our tpc .",

    "the chip output data then contain no charge structure in @xmath1 , only the relative threshold - crossing time of the charge cloud from pixel to pixel in units of @xmath17  ns . some charge is lost , such as below - threshold charge at the edge of a track or charge that arrives after a pixel has fallen below threshold .",

    "we recover absolute @xmath1 using distributions of the four track topology coordinates @xmath5 , @xmath0 , relative @xmath1 and tot .",

    "this can be converted to initial ionization energy if the work function of the gas , the fraction of the chip surface that is sensitive to charge , and total effective gain are known , a step that is not necessary in this analysis .",

    "specifically , we consider a line of ionization charge with an initial delta - function charge cross - section .",
    "the constituent charges diffuse in space in a 3-d random walk over time , giving a charge profile which is gaussian in cross - section with a constant integral and a width that is proportional to the square root of time , @xmath28 . in the presence of a linear potential",
    ", the charge line drifts to the detector plane at a constant velocity , implying that the width of the charge distribution is also proportional to the square root of absolute @xmath1 , or @xmath29 .",

    "we rotate to a new `` track '' coordinate system to look  down the barrel \" of the track ; the track now lies along the @xmath37 axis , the u - shaped shell opens towards the @xmath38 direction , and the lateral track width dimension is now @xmath2 ( see fig .",

    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile_shell ] , even @xmath46  cm - long flat alpha tracks have clean charge profiles due to the slow dependence of ionization energy density on distance from source .",

    "an example of this fit applied to the charge profile of a flat track ( @xmath25 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile_fit ] .    for highly saturated segments , such as those from steeply angled tracks near @xmath51 ,",
    "the gaussian parameters are poorly constrained , in particular the height @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , for the determination of the diffusion parameters @xmath30 and @xmath33 we select only fits with a normalized chi - squared below @xmath52 ( efficiency @xmath53 ) .",

    "neutron or wimp recoils , the absolute @xmath1 precision will depend strongly on the length of the track .",
    "we have already successfully applied the technique described here to mm - length alpha track segments , and plan to study nuclear recoils next .",
    "the techniques developed for this analysis can be applied to a number of related questions which are largely beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we summarize them here for completeness .",
    "the first extension of this technique is a recovery of charge loss due to threshold and saturation effects .",
    "we consider a gaussian which is defined by the shape parameters determined by a charge profile fit .",
    "the gaussian extends beyond the threshold region and above the saturation region , therefore it represents the entire charge profile without losses .",
    "a full discussion of this technique is not possible here , but we have observed that recovery of charge lost to saturation is possible even for very saturated tracks .",
    "the recovery of the full charge for each segment also allows for a determination of the dependence of ionization energy on the distance from the source .",
    "we find slopes consistent with zero , suggesting that @xmath32 can be considered uniform for the sources within the tpc .    as a complementary approach to the charge profile fit method",
    ", we also attempted to calibrate absolute @xmath1 using fits to the shape of the charge shell .",
    "the physics model is somewhat more complicated than in the profile case due to the interplay between re - absorption , diffusion and chip threshold .",
    "we fit ellipses to the shell scatterplots @xmath38 vs. @xmath2 for the track segments and determine that no @xmath63 correspondence between shell semi - major or semi - minor widths and @xmath36 is likely .",
    "however , there is a relationship between the shell fit residuals and @xmath1 that is apparently linear in @xmath1 .",
    "absolute-@xmath1 determination with this method is only accurate to @xmath64  cm and therefore is not included in this analysis .",
    "we have presented a method for measuring absolute @xmath1 in tpcs using charge cloud topology information .",
    "the key technical features that enable this technique are high spatial resolution of the pixel chip and charge measurement in each pixel . while high spatial resolution alone is enough to measure the diffusion width of tracks , this width also depends strongly on nuisance parameters , such as the detector threshold , gas purity , and the specific ionization of the track . by also utilizing charge information ,",
    "the technique presented here does not require knowledge of the initial ionization energy and is tolerant of saturation and threshold effects .",
    "it is possible to further optimize the absolute @xmath1 precision using a lower threshold and higher maximum tot scale , though gains may be small except for very low @xmath1 .",
    "this technique is best used as a live calibration of the absolute @xmath1 scale since the diffusion parameters may depend on gas quality , gain , drift velocity and other factors and thus may not be stable over time .",
    "embedding one or more sources such as polonium-210 in the vessel during operation can provide time - dependent calibrations .",
    "the technique used here also provides a way to recover charge lost due to chip threshold and saturation effects , which naturally provides a measurement of gas impurities by way of charge loss over drift distance .",
