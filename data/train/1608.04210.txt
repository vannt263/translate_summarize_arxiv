    "the main question of interest is to determine the set of parameters for which the measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .",

    "finally , we turn to recent developments in sections [ sc : results ] and [ sc : proofs ] .",
    "i am grateful to jean bourgain , emmanuel breuillard , mike hochman , elon lindenstrauss , pablo shmerkin and boris solomyak for many helpful and inspiring discussions on the subject of this note .",
    "this section is a very brief overview of some of the earlier results on bernoulli convolutions , which is by no means intended to be comprehensive .",
    "a more detailed account of the first sixty years of the problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "fourier transform is a powerful tool in studying bernoulli convolutions , and it dominated the early literature including @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "erds furthered this line of research in two important papers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since @xmath7 is the law of a sum of independent random variables , its fourier transform is the product of the fourier transforms of the individual terms .",
    "indeed , @xmath18    erds used this formula to prove the following two results .",
    "[ th : erdos1 ] suppose that @xmath19 is a number such that @xmath20 is a pisot number .",
    "then @xmath7 is singular with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "recall that a pisot number ( or pisot - vijayaraghavan number ) is an algebraic integer all of whose galois conjugates are inside the unit disk .",
    "one example of such a number is the golden ratio @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath20 is a pisot number , then @xmath22 is very closely approximated by integers , in fact @xmath23 for all @xmath24 for some number @xmath25 depending only on @xmath6 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the sum of all galois conjugates of @xmath22 is an integer . using this",
    ", erds proved that @xmath26 can be bounded below by a positive number independent of @xmath27 , hence @xmath7 would violate the riemann lebesgue lemma if it were absolutely continuous .",
    "the second result of erds is the following .",
    "[ th : erdos2 ] for every @xmath28 , there is @xmath29 such that the following holds . for almost every @xmath30 , @xmath7 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , and its density is @xmath31 times continuously differentiable .    referring to the original paper for the proof , we restrict ourselves to a brief heuristic .",
    "we consider the factors @xmath32 in . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the argument of @xmath34 is close to @xmath35 , hence the value of these factors is close to @xmath36 . on the other hand , for a typical @xmath6",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that a positive proportion of the first @xmath37 factors are bounded away from @xmath36 , hence we expect that @xmath38 i.e. the fourier transform of @xmath7 has an arbitrarily fast power type fourier decay , provided @xmath6 is sufficiently close to @xmath36 .",
    "erds found an ingenious argument to make this heuristic rigorous .",
    "kahane @xcite observed that erds s proof of theorem [ th : erdos2 ] yield a bound on the hausdorff dimension for the exceptional set of parameters ( i.e. for the set of parameters , for which the bernoulli convolution does not have @xmath31 times differentiable density ) .",
    "see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) for a detailed discussion .",
    "salem proved a partial converse to theorem [ th : erdos1 ] by showing that @xmath39 as @xmath40 if @xmath20 is not a pisot number , however , this is not strong enough information to conclude that @xmath7 is absolutely continuous . for pisot parameters ,",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath7 was studied by sarnak @xcite and sidorov and solomyak @xcite .",
    "they proved that the set of limit points of @xmath41 for @xmath27 is countable , a question motivated by the spectra of multipliers .",
    "there is another class of algebraic numbers for which the bernoulli convolution has slow fourier decay .",
    "a salem number is an algebraic integer @xmath42 of degree at least @xmath43 whose galois conjugates include @xmath44 and all others are on the unit circle .",
    "it is known ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ? * section 5 ) ) that @xmath7 does not have a power - type fourier decay if @xmath20 is a salem number , that is to say , @xmath45 for every @xmath46 .",
    "this does not imply that @xmath7 is singular , but it implies that @xmath7 may not have any fractional derivatives in @xmath47 .",
    "salem numbers are poorly understood .",
    "it is not known whether they form a dense subset of @xmath48 . in comparison , we know that pisot numbers form a closed subset of the real numbers , a result due to salem @xcite .",
    "feng and wang @xcite gave examples of bernoulli convolutions with non - pisot and non - salem algebraic parameters whose density , if it exists , does not belong to @xmath49 .      in the previous section ,",
    "we have seen examples of singular bernoulli convolutions in the interesting parameter range @xmath50 .",
    "these are complemented by the examples of @xmath51 for @xmath52 , which are absolutely continuous , as observed by wintner @xcite .",

    "consider the series defining bernoulli convolutions and separate the terms divisible by @xmath55 from the rest . since @xmath15 is absolutely continuous , so is @xmath51 .",
    "garsia extended this set of examples .",
    "to state his result , we recall the following notion .    [ df : mahler ]",
    "let @xmath6 be an algebraic number and write @xmath56 for its minimal polynomial in @xmath57 $ ] , i.e. @xmath58 is the leading coefficient and @xmath59 are its galois conjugates .",
    "the mahler measure of @xmath6 is the number @xmath60    this quantity is widely used to measure the complexity of an algebraic number .",
    "[ th : garsia ] let @xmath6 be a number such that @xmath20 is an algebraic integer and @xmath61 . then @xmath62 is absolutely continuous with a density in @xmath63 .",
    "the numbers @xmath64 all satisfy the hypothesis of the theorem , and garsia provided the real roots of @xmath65 for @xmath66 as further examples .",
    "rodemich found additional such polynomials including @xmath67 until recently the numbers provided by theorem [ th : garsia ] were the only known explicit examples of absolutely continuous bernoulli convolutions .",
    "see @xcite for a study of these numbers .",
    "garsia s proof is based on the following ideas .",
    "he showed that these numbers are not algebraic integers themselves and hence have the property that @xmath68 for any non - zero polynomial @xmath69 that has coefficients @xmath70 , @xmath35 or @xmath36 only .",
    "this implies that the random variable @xmath71 takes @xmath72 different values with equal probabilities .",
    "indeed , if @xmath73 are two different sequences , then @xmath74    the set of polynomials of degree at most @xmath75 with coefficient @xmath70 , @xmath35 or @xmath36 play an important role in the study of bernoulli convolutions , therefore we introduce the notation @xmath76 for it . the second ingredient in garsia s proof",
    "is the following estimate that also plays an important role in later developments .",
    "[ th : garsia - separation ] let @xmath6 be an algebraic number and denote by @xmath31 the number of its galois conjugates on the unit circle .",
    "then @xmath77 for any @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a constant depending only on @xmath6 .",
    "garsia showed that under the hypothesis of theorem [ th : garsia ] , @xmath6 has no conjugates on the unit circle , hence there is a constant @xmath79 such that consecutive points in the support of @xmath71 are separated by at least @xmath80 .",
    "therefore the number of points that fall in a given interval of length @xmath81 is at most @xmath82 .",
    "since each atom has probability @xmath83 , this gives an upper bound @xmath84 for the probability that @xmath71 is in the interval in question , and the claim follows if we take the limit @xmath85 .      as we have discussed in section [ sc : fourier ] , erds showed that @xmath62 is absolutely continuous for almost all @xmath6 in an interval near @xmath36 . whether or not the same holds on @xmath86 was open until a remarkable paper of solomyak @xcite .",
    "the bernoulli convolution @xmath7 is absolutely continuous and has density in @xmath49 for almost every @xmath50 .",
    "solomyak s original proof has been simplified in @xcite .",
    "the result has been improved by peres and schlag @xcite , who proved that the density also has fractional derivatives in @xmath49 and they gave estimates for the hausdorff dimension of the exceptional set of parameters , for which @xmath7 is singular .",
    "for the details we refer to the original papers and the survey @xcite , which treats the topic extensively .",
    "now we only highlight the main idea , called transversality , which can be traced back to pollicott and simon @xcite .",
    "denote by @xmath87 the set of analytic functions on the unit disk , whose taylor series at @xmath35 has the coefficients @xmath70 , @xmath35 or @xmath36 only .",
    "solomyak proved that @xmath88 $ ] is an interval of transversality for @xmath76 , that is to say , any function in @xmath76 may have at most @xmath36 zero in the interval @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "some bound on the number of zeros could be deduced from jensen s formula , however , it is essential for the argument that there are no more than a single zero , and the proof of this fact requires much more delicate ideas .",
    "we indicate briefly and heuristically why transversality is useful in the study of bernoulli convolutions .",
    "let @xmath89 and @xmath90 be two independent sequences of independent unbiased @xmath91 variables and consider the random variables @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which both have distribution @xmath7 . fix a small number @xmath94 and consider a subdivision of the support of @xmath7 into intervals of length @xmath95 .",
    "if @xmath7 is singular , then most of the mass is concentrated on a small proportion of these intervals .",
    "this suggests that if @xmath7 is singular then @xmath96 is ` much larger ' than it would be if the distribution was absolutely continuous .",
    "a nice way to quantify this idea is the following statement . if there is a constant @xmath97 independent of @xmath95 such that @xmath98 then @xmath7 is absolutely continuous with density in @xmath49 .",
    "now we fix the values @xmath99 and @xmath100 and take a random value of @xmath6 uniformly in the interval @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "knowing that @xmath101 may have only one zero in this interval allows us to estimate the probability of the event @xmath102 in terms of the first index @xmath103 such that @xmath104 .",
    "taking expectation over the @xmath99 and @xmath100 gives the desired result .",
    "for the details of this argument see @xcite .",
    "bernoulli convolutions are natural objects from several points of view including fractal geometry , dynamics and number theory .",
    "we have already seen that the arithmetic properties of @xmath6 has a decisive influence on the regularity of bernoulli convolutions .",
    "this is a dominant feature also in the more recent results that we discuss later .",
    "bernoulli convolutions appear naturally in the context of dynamics . for example , alexander and yorke @xcite described the sinai ruelle bowen measure for the fat baker s transformation in terms of bernoulli convolutions . for further studies of dynamical properties of bernoulli convolutions",
    "see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a detailed exposition of these connections would go beyond the scope of these notes .",
    "we limit ourselves to a brief discussion of a more general framework to which bernoulli convolutions belong .",
    "then we briefly mention a conjecture of breuillard on growth of groups and its connection to bernoulli convolutions .      given a continuous map @xmath105 on a @xmath106-compact metric space and a measure @xmath54 on @xmath107 , we denote by @xmath108 the pushforward of @xmath54 , that is the unique measure that satisfies @xmath109 for all compactly supported continuous functions @xmath110 .",
    "it follows from the definition that bernoulli convolutions satisfy the identity @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that for any given @xmath6 , there is precisely one probability measure that satisfies this identity and this provides an alternative definition of bernoulli convolutions .",
    "it is easy to see from this definition that bernoulli convolutions are always of pure type .",
    "that is , they are singular or absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure . indeed , if this was not the case , then both the singular and the absolutely continuous parts would satisfy .",
    "in fact , more is true .",
    "mauldin and simon @xcite proved that , if non - singular , @xmath7 is equivalent to the lebesgue measure restricted to the support of @xmath7 , that is to say , the lebesgue measure is also absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "this definition of bernoulli convolutions generalizes in a straight forward manner .",
    "let @xmath113 be a collection of contracting similarities of euclidean space @xmath114 and let @xmath115 be a probability vector .",
    "then there is a unique probability measure @xmath54 on @xmath114 that satisfies the identity @xmath116 measures with this property are called self - similar .",
    "the requirement that the similarities @xmath117 are contracting may be relaxed .",
    "this concept can be further generalized if we allow the transformations @xmath117 to be in a more general class , for example affine transformations . in the latter case , the measure satisfying the identity is called self - affine .",
    "certain self - affine structures have intimate connections to bernoulli convolutions , see for example the work of przytycki and urbaski @xcite .",
    "another class of related measures are the so - called furstenberg measures . to define them",
    ", we consider the projective line @xmath118 and we require @xmath117 to be mobius transformations . these measures play an important role in the study of random walks in lie groups and also in the anderson - bernoulli model on @xmath119 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for some recent results about these measures ; some techniques used in these papers have strong analogues in the study of bernoulli convolutions .",
    "let @xmath120 be a group and let @xmath121 be a finite subset .",
    "we denote by @xmath122 the set of elements of @xmath120 that can be expressed as the product of @xmath123 elements of @xmath124 .",
    "( repetition of elements is allowed . )",
    "the speed at which the sequence @xmath125 grows and its relation to the structure of the group @xmath120 has been extensively studied in combinatorial and geometric group theory .",
    "a celebrated result of gromov @xcite asserts that @xmath125 grows polynomially if and only if the group generated by @xmath124 is virtually nilpotent .",
    "if @xmath120 is a free group and @xmath124 contains at least two non - commuting elements , then @xmath125 grows exponentially .",
    "grigorchuk @xcite gave examples of groups of intermediate growth , that is , when @xmath125 grows faster than any polynomial but slower than exponential .    if @xmath126 , then the tits alternative yields a duality : the growth of @xmath125 is either a polynomial or exponential . in this case , the exponential growth rate defined as @xmath127 is an important quantity of interest .",
    "breuillard @xcite has made the following conjecture .",
    "[ cj : growth ] for every integer @xmath128 , there is @xmath129 such that @xmath130 for any @xmath131 .",

    "see @xcite and @xcite for related earlier work .",
    "breuillard @xcite also observed the importance of the special case @xmath132 he noted that @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the mahler measure of @xmath6 , which we encountered in section [ sc : garsia ] .",
    "this means that breuillard s growth conjecture implies lehmer s conjecture , which asserts that the value of @xmath134 is bounded away from @xmath36 for numbers that are not roots of unity .",
    "the semigroup generated by @xmath135 is intimately related to bernoulli convolutions .",

    "the proof utilizes measures related to bernoulli convolutions . using these estimates",
    ", they proved that conjecture [ cj : growth ] is equivalent to lehmer s conjecture .",
    "( the general case of the growth conjecture can be reduced to the case of @xmath135 . )",
    "the estimates for the entropy of the random walk also have consequences for the dimension of bernoulli convolutions , which we will discuss in the next section .",
    "hochman @xcite made a recent breakthrough in the study of self - similar measures .",
    "( see also @xcite for a more elementary exposition . )",
    "we discuss his results only in the special case of bernoulli convolutions , but they are valid in greater generality , in fact , he extended them even to higher dimensions subsequently @xcite .",
    "one of his results provide the following information about bernoulli convolutions of dimension less than @xmath36 .",

    "[ th : hochman ] suppose @xmath50 is a number such that @xmath138 and let @xmath139 .",

    "we note that the packing dimension of a set is always at least as large as its hausdorff dimension , so the exceptional set is also of @xmath35 hausdorff dimension .",
    "in fact , to conclude the result for hausdorff dimension it would be enough to know that there are infinitely many integers @xmath75 such that the algebraic approximation exists at the corresponding scales .",
