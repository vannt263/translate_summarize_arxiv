    "studying radio recombination lines ( rrls ) is one of the most direct ways of probing ionized gas such as hii regions .",
    "ionized gas properties such as kinematics , electron temperatures , and the geometrical filling factor can be directly constrained by the recombination line flux density , line width , free - free continuum flux density , and size of the line - emitting regions . at centimeter",
    "( cm ) wavelengths , rrls are primarily stimulated emission amplifying extended non - thermal synchrotron emission .",
    "therefore , distinguishing emission arising from diffuse , low density gas from that from clumpy , high density gas is difficult .",
    "also , pressure broadening of the line width can complicate the interpretation of the cm rrl observations .",
    "for instance , cm rrl emission from luminous starburst systems such as arp  220 may be dominated by internally stimulated emission from diffuse ionized gas @xcite while spontaneous emission process is important at higher frequencies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "interpretation of recombination lines at millimeter ( mm ) wavelengths is more straightforward since stimulated emission and pressure broadening become negligible in most cases .",
    "recent studies of mm rrls in galactic h ii regions @xcite and starburst galaxies @xcite found higher line fluxes than expected from the lower frequency measurements . a steep rise in line flux density with frequency , characteristic of optically thin spontaneous emission ,",
    "is seen in nearby starburst galaxies m82 and ngc  253 @xcite .",
    "the central 1 parsec region surrounding the putative central source in our galactic center , sgr a@xmath2 , is a frequent target of multi - wavelength investigations primarily because it is the nearest and the best laboratory for studying the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) phenomenon and its fueling process .",
    "currently this region appears to be relatively gas free .",
    "however , immediately surrounding sgr a@xmath2  is an array of ionized gas streamers (  sgr a west  ; see review by * ? ? ?",
    "these streamers have been previously studied in the 12.8 @xmath11 m [ ne ii ] @xcite , p@xmath0 @xcite , and in cm rrl @xcite , and they consist of several distinct kinematic features . the total mass of the ionized streamers is estimated to be less than 100 m@xmath12 in total .",
    "recent ir and radio observations found evidence for _ neutral _ gas within this central `` cavity '' @xcite , suggesting a more substantial presence of gas in the central parsec region . surrounding and closely interacting with the ionized streamers is the dense and clumpy molecular ring commonly referred to as the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) .",
    "the cnd is asymmetric about sgr a@xmath2 , indicating its possible origin related to a gravitational capture of a passing cloud or energetic disruption of a stable ring @xcite .",
    "this ring is believed to represent a circumnuclear accretion disk feeding the inner parsec although some have argued that the cnd is not a complete ring ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ionized streamers in sgr a  west are explained as cloudlets from the clumpy ring that after losing momentum have fallen toward the center and thereby have stretched and have been ionized by photo - dissociation within the inner parsec ( see * ? ? ?",
    "sensitive imaging studies in cm rrl @xcite suggest high temperature ( @xmath13 k ) , with a possible radial temperature gradient increasing toward sgr a@xmath2 . the large proper motions of the stars very close to sgr a@xmath2  suggest central dark mass of 2.5 - 4.1 @xmath14 m@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "motivated by the detection of extragalactic mm rrls and recent new observations of the galactic center region , we have imaged the h@xmath15 line at high angular resolution toward sgr a@xmath2  in order to study the nature of the ionized streamers and their relation to the dense neutral gas in and around the cnd . at high frequencies ,",
    "most of the rrl and continuum emission comes from the densest ionized gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the primary goals of this study is to examine the existence of ionized gas denser than that traced by cm - wavelength rrls in this region .",
    "the nature of the radiation mechanism is investigated by analyzing the new h31@xmath0 , h35@xmath0 , h41@xmath0 , and h44@xmath0 line observations obtained at the nrao 12-m telescope at kitt peak , arizona .",
    "we further examine whether any dense _",
    "neutral _ gas is directly associated with the ionized streamers using our sensitive , high resolution hco@xmath10 ( 10 ) images .",
    "our hco@xmath10 ( 10 ) data have superior sensitivity and angular resolution over the previously published observations of similar molecular species @xcite . in addition , a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution and kinematics of the dense molecular gas and ionized gas in the cnd is offered using a simple kinematical model .",
    "the h41@xmath0 and hco@xmath10 ( 10 ) observations were made using the low , equatorial and high resolution configurations of the millimeter telescope array at owens valley radio observatory .",
    "the observational parameters from the multi - configuration observations conducted during the spring and fall 1998 are given in table  [ tab : ovrosummary ] .",
    "the ovro array consists of six 10.4 meter telescopes equipped with cooled sis receivers .",
    "interferometric measurements are made using a total of 45 independent baselines in order to maximize the sampling of the uv - plane and to achieve the highest imaging dynamic range possible . in the high resolution configuration the longest baseline used was 220 meters .",
    "the spectrometer modules were arranged so that each line was covered with a total of 60 channels at 4 mhz ( 13 ) resolution centered at the velocity of @xmath16 . by setting the lo frequency at 90.5 ghz , h41@xmath0 line at 92 ghz ( upper sideband ) and hco@xmath10 ( 10 ) line at 89 ghz ( lower sideband ) could be observed simultaneously .",

    "a nearby calibrator nrao 530 was observed every 15 minutes to track the atmosphere and instrumental gain .",
    "the amplitude scaling is derived from the observations of 3c  273 , whose flux density is monitored daily relative to uranus and neptune with an accuracy of about 20% .",
    "the data were reduced using the ovro data reduction program mma @xcite .",

    "the data were imaged and analyzed using difmap @xcite and astronomical image processing system ( aips ) provided by the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) . of the total 60 channels in the spectra , 15 line - free channels ( 60 mhz total ) were used to construct the continuum image .",
    "unresolved strong continuum source sgr a@xmath2  ( @xmath20 jy beam@xmath21 ) and the ionized streamers were used for self - calibration in difmap , and the continuum was subtracted from the spectral line channels .",
    "all spectral and continuum images were corrected for primary beam attenuation .",
    "subsequent analysis of the spectral line data cubes were conducted using aips and groningen image processing system ( gipsy ) .",
    "we have obtained the h31@xmath0 ( 210.502 ghz ) , h35@xmath0 ( 147.047 ghz ) , h41@xmath0 ( 92.034 ghz ) , and h44@xmath0 ( 74.645 ghz ) hydrogen recombination line spectra of sgr a west using the nrao 12-m telescope at kitt peak during may 1998 .",
    "the nrao 12-m telescope is equipped with single sideband sis receivers , and typical system temperature ranged between 250 and 400 k ( ssb ) , despite the low elevation of the source .",
    "the beam size is inversely proportional to the frequency and is 69@xmath22 at 92 ghz .",
    "both the filter banks ( 500 mhz at 2 mhz resolution ) and hybrid digital spectrometer ( 600 mhz at 0.78 mhz resolution ) were used to record the data",
    ". a wide range of off positions were examined , mostly along the minima in co and hcn surveys of the galactic center region .",
    "after an extensive investigation , it was determined that the hydrogen recombination line emission is highly localized around sgr a@xmath2 , and the final spectra presented here were obtained with a simple azimuth offset of @xmath23 .    from the observatory report on the telescope efficiency measurements ,",
    "we adopt the corrected main beam efficiency @xmath24 of 0.48 , 0.85 , 0.90 , and 0.95 for the four observed frequencies , respectively @xcite .",
    "these efficiencies are used to convert the observed brightness temperature @xmath25 to the main beam temperature @xmath26 and then to flux density .",

    "the east - west oriented filamentary structure located immediately south of sgr a@xmath2  is the bar of sgr a west .",
    "the total continuum flux at 92 ghz from the bar is about 0.9 jy with a peak brightness of 0.7 jy beam@xmath21 .",
    "the bar appears to connect to the western arc and the eastern arc on each ends .",
    "running almost perpendicular to the bar is the northern arm with higher total integrated flux density of about 1.1 jy .",

    "the morphology of the ionized gas around the sgr a  complex shown in figure  [ fig : continuum ] is remarkably similar to the 8.3 ghz continuum image by @xcite .    the peak flux density measured outside sgr a@xmath2  range between 0.1 @xmath30 0.75 jy beam@xmath21 ( see table  [ tab : continuum ] ) , which corresponds to peak brightness temperature of 1.1 @xmath30 6.0 k. assuming this continuum is largely thermal free - free emission from 7000 k gas ( see   [ sec : l / c ] )",
    ", one can infer an optical depth of @xmath31 if the emitting region fills the beam with a unit filling factor .",
    "even if the filling factor is not near unity , this inference of optically thin emission should be secure unless the continuum emission is entirely concentrated into discrete clumps with a diameter of 0.005 pc ( 1000 au ) or smaller .",
    "continuum optical depth is given by @xmath32 assuming @xmath33 k , the emission measure ( @xmath34 ) required to produce continuum opacity of @xmath35 at 92 ghz is @xmath36 @xmath37 pc . if the thickness of the filaments along the line of sight is comparable to the apparent width ( @xmath38 pc ) ,",
    "then the inferred mean electron density is @xmath6 @xmath7 ( @xmath39 @xmath40 ) .",
    "if the ionized gas is clumped at much smaller scales , then the electron density would be correspondingly larger . in comparison",
    ", @xcite derived @xmath41 @xmath7 from their analysis of fine - structure line ratios .",
    "the consideration of collisional de - excitation of the observed [ ne ii ] emission places an upper limit on the electron density of about @xmath42 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "therefore the geometry of the ionized gas must be fairly smooth over 0.01 - 0.1 pc scales .",
    "the velocity integrated line flux density (  moment zero \" ) image , shown in figure  [ fig : h41a ] , was generated by summing the continuum subtracted h41@xmath0 image cube over all velocity channels with line emission ( from @xmath43  to + 221 ; see figure  3 ) .",
    "the cross marks the position of sgr a@xmath2 .",
    "the main features seen in the line emission map are very similar to the 92 ghz continuum map shown in figure  [ fig : continuum ] , except for the absence of the bright , compact source corresponding to sgr a@xmath2 .",
    "the emission from the western arc is weaker than seen in continuum .",
    "the northern arm is the brightest continuum feature besides sgr a@xmath2 , and the brightest h41@xmath0 emission region also occurs in the northern arm just northeast of sgr a@xmath2 .",
    "the central bar shows a wide range of emission intensity and structures .",
    "a summary of the measured parameters for all major features are given in table  [ tab : h41a ] .",
    "the sizes tabulated for the listed regions have been calculated assuming 1@xmath44 = 2.5 pc @xcite .",
    "unlike the 92 ghz continuum that peaks at sgr a@xmath2 , the brightest feature in h41@xmath0 occurs in the northern arm with a peak brightness temperature of @xmath45 k. the western arc , however , appears relatively weak in h41@xmath0 line .",
    "the peak line brightness for all h41@xmath0 are @xmath46 k , and thus the h41@xmath0 emission is also optically thin , @xmath47 ( see below ) .",
    "the spatially averaged h41@xmath0 line profiles for the six prominent emission regions ( identified with boxes ) are shown in figure  [ fig : l / c ] .",
    "the gipsy tasks profil and profit were used to calculate the line - to - continuum ( l / c ) ratios and to fit a gaussian profile to the data using a least squares procedure .",
    "the crosses indicate the data points , the solid lines are the gaussian profiles , and the dashed lines represent the residuals .",
    "calculations of gaussian profiles yield four parameters : peak line - to - continuum flux density ratio , velocity integrated line intensity , central velocity , and the line width .",
    "these parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : te ] along with the derived lte electron temperature derived from the l / c ratios ( see further discussions in   [ sec : l / c ] ) .",
    "a typical l / c ratio along the northern arm is around 0.4 .",
    "the l / c ratio is the largest ( @xmath48 ) in the western arc while the l / c ratio in the bar drops from 0.6 to 0.03 within the 2 to 4 beam radii of sgr a@xmath2 .",
    "the kinematics of the ionized gas traced by h41@xmath0 shown in figures  3 and [ fig : l / c ] are generally consistent with that of rotation about sgr a@xmath2 , similar to that of the cnd , in broad agreement with previous studies of sgra west in rrls @xcite and in 12.8 @xmath11 m [ ne ii ] @xcite .",
    "the central bar spans a very wide range of velocity , between + 33  and @xmath30293  ( see figure  3 ) , much larger than those associated with the northern arm ( between + 163   and + 7 ) and the western arc ( between @xmath307  and @xmath30111 ) .",
    "this large velocity gradient suggests that this gas is located deeper in the gravitational potential , much closer to the central mass concentration , than the rest of the ionized gas .",
    "citing the relatively cool dust temperature along the bar , @xcite have argued that the nearness of the bar to sgr a@xmath2  is largely in projection only , but this large spread in velocity and the correspondingly large velocity gradient requires that this gas feature has to be located much closer to the central mass concentration than the northern arm and the western arc . since the cnd is already viewed with a large inclination ( @xmath49 ) , placing a gas streamer in a more edge - on orbit can increase the line - of - sight velocity only by about 25% . therefore a viewing geometry alone can not account for the large observed velocity gradient .",
    "neither the angular resolution nor the overall s /",
    "n of the new h41@xmath0 data are better than the previous vla h92@xmath0 measurements , and the main new insight obtained is that the ionized gas traced in h41@xmath0 emission share the same kinematics as the gas responsible for the h92@xmath0 emission .",
    "the h41@xmath0 line widths of the ionized streamers range between 43  and 347  ( see table  [ tab : te ] ) .",
    "the broadest line is seen toward sgr a@xmath2  with @xmath50v = @xmath51  ( see figure  [ fig : l / c ] , box 4 ) , but the s / n of this measurement is quite small in each individual channels .",
    "the next broadest line occurs in the vicinity of bright h41@xmath0 region in the northern arm with @xmath50v @xmath52   ( box 6 in figure  [ fig : l / c ] ) .",
    "the narrowest line is seen toward the southern end of the western arc ( box 3 in figure  [ fig : l / c ] ) with @xmath50v @xmath53 .",
    "using 2  resolution vla h92@xmath0 images , @xcite have shown that crowding of distinct kinematical components along the line of sight can make the emission lines appear much broader than the intrinsic line width of about 50 . combined with",
    "the large velocity gradient expected near the central mass concentration , the large line width we derive from h41@xmath0 emission must be primarily the result of spatial averaging resulting from our large observing beam of @xmath54 .",
    "a typical line width measured in each pixel is between 40 - 75 . given the low s / n of the data , it is not physically meaningful to deconvolve the individual kinematic components by fitting multiple gaussians to the observed spectra .",
    "there is a clear trend of increasing l / c ratio with a decreasing line width .",
    "such a trend is expected if the line and continuum emission arises from the same ionized gas clouds and the emitting gas has a narrow range of electron temperature ( see   [ sec : l / c ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hco+ ] shows the high resolution image of the molecular ring in hco@xmath10 emission ( grey - scale ) superimposed over the h41@xmath0 ( contour ) emission .",
    "the circumnuclear ring traced in hco@xmath10 appears more complete than seen in the previous hcn  @xcite and hco@xmath10  @xcite images obtained using the bima array .",
    "more recently @xcite imaged hcn , hco@xmath10 , and h42@xmath0 in a wider field of view using a 19-pointing mosaic , offering a much better overall picture of the molecular gas distribution in the 10 pc region surrounding the sgr a@xmath2 .",
    "however , the latest bima data by wright et al . are not much better than the older bima data in resolution and sensitivity .",
    "these different images agree with each other broadly , but significant differences also exist in the details .",
    "one important difference is that the angular resolution of our new ovro data is 40% better than those of gsten et al . and",
    "marr et al . , and our sensitivity is also 4 and 15 times improved , respectively .",
    "the bima array is more sensitive to faint extended emission , and its data reduction procedure is tuned to emphasize such features .",
    "in contrast , our moment analysis is more sensitive to identifying bright emission clumps , and this accounts for the more complete appearance of the cnd in figure  [ fig : hco+ ] , consisting of many discrete features . determining whether any dense _",
    "neutral _ gas is associated with the ionized streamers surrounding sgr a@xmath2  is one of the major objectives for our study . while the new observations have revealed clear evidence for a close physical link between ionized and neutral molecular gas ( as discussed later in ",
    "[ sec : cnd ] ) , no hco@xmath10 emission is found spatially and kinematically coincident with the ionized streamers traced in h41@xmath0 ( see figure  3 ) . actually hco@xmath10 absorption is seen in many channels , particularly at blueshifted velocities , but most of these features show little kinematic relation to the h41@xmath0 emission .",
    "the spatial distribution of hco@xmath10 absorption resembles the entire continuum structure , and therefore the absorbing gas must be located in the foreground , associated with the 100 pc scale molecular disk imaged by @xcite and others . among the redshifted velocity channels where little foreground absorption is present ( e.g. , + 117 to + 195 km / s )",
    ", there is little evidence for hco@xmath10 absorption at the locations of the h41@xmath0 and continuum emission peaks . in these channels ,",
    "the upper limit to the optical depth for hco@xmath10 absorption is about 0.3 ( @xmath56 ) at a spectral resolution of 13 .",
    "this limit corresponds to an upper limit on the hco@xmath10 column density of @xmath57 @xmath40 . for an assumed hco@xmath10 abundance of @xmath58 ,",
    "this translates into an h@xmath59 column density of @xmath60 @xmath40 . if the hco@xmath10 abundance appropriate for a translucent cloud ( where ion chemistry is important , see",
    "* ) is adopted , the inferred upper limit on the @xmath61 column density becomes as little as @xmath62 @xmath40 .",
    "these upper limits are close to or smaller than the column density of @xmath63 @xmath40 inferred from the [ o i]/[c ii ] far - ir line ratio @xcite and the mid - ir color analysis @xcite . using the calculations by @xcite ,",
    "@xcite have proposed that most of the molecules in the neutral gas inside the central cavity with @xmath64 @xmath40 are photo - dissociated and that the neutral gas is primarily atomic .",
    "our hco@xmath10 absorption measurements are consistent with these conclusions , and we conclude independently that sgr a west filaments are either highly ionized or are largely atomic .",
    "the hydrogen recombination line spectra obtained at the nrao 12-m telescope are shown in figure  [ fig:12 m ] , and the observing frequency and the measured line flux are summarized in table  [ tab:12 m ] .",
    "the mm frequency window is rich in spectral transitions , and studying faint emission lines in the galactic center region can be challenging .",

    "we have mapped h41@xmath0 emission in a 2  by 3  region centered on sgr a@xmath2  in order to examine the spatial extent of this spectral feature .",
    "the broad emission feature seen in the ovro data and in the h44@xmath0 spectrum is spatially confined only to the central position while the bright , narrow feature appears everywhere with little velocity gradient .",
    "the narrow line width , little velocity gradient , and wide - spread distribution strongly indicate that this narrow component is a galactic foreground emission .",
    "a likely identification is ch@xmath67cn , which has transitions at 91.959 , 91.970 , 91.980 , 91.985 , and 91.987 ghz .",

    "the telescope beam at 210.502 ghz is about 30  and spatially resolves the sgr a west structure .",
    "therefore a 3 @xmath69 3 grid map was obtained at full beam sampling .",

    "the h41@xmath0 channel maps ( figure  3 ) suggest that our h31@xmath0 spectrum may be missing some redshifted emission at @xmath70 = 50 - 150 km s@xmath21 .",
    "nevertheless , the summed spectrum closely resembles the h41@xmath0 and h44@xmath0 spectra , and we made no attempt to correct for any missing flux .",
    "the nine brightest hco@xmath10 clumps within the cnd are identified as localized peaks of velocity integrated hco@xmath10 flux density map ( figure  [ fig : hco+ ] ) , and their physical sizes and emission characteristics are summarized in table  [ tab : hco+ ] .",
    "the peak line brightness temperature , averaged over the @xmath71 ( 0.29 pc @xmath69 0.15 pc ) beam , ranges between 10 and 30 k. in comparison , the gas temperature derived from nh@xmath67 is 60 - 70 k @xcite while the dust temperature of about 75 k is derived by latvakoski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from the far - infrared observations .",
    "since hco@xmath10 emission is strongly absorbed by the foreground gas along the line of sight and the beam filling factor is likely less than unity , the gas temperature inferred from the observed line brightness is strictly a lower limit .",
    "the measured peak hco@xmath10 line temperature is comparable to the values found by earlier bima studies ( see   [ sec : hco+ ] ) with a lower angular resolution , and one can safely deduce that the optically thick molecular gas nearly fills the beam at @xmath72 pc scales in these cnd clumps .",
    "we have computed virial masses of the individual hco@xmath10 emitting clouds as , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the radius of the cloud in pc and @xmath75 is the line width in km s@xmath21 . if these individual molecular gas clumps are self - gravitating , then their masses range between @xmath76 ( see table  [ tab : hco+ ] ) . assuming a spherical geometry , the mean mass density ( @xmath77 ) is between @xmath78 g @xmath7 and mean h@xmath59 molecule density of @xmath79 @xmath7 .",

    "for a central source with a mass of @xmath81 @xcite , the critical mass density required to survive the tidal shear at a radius of 1.5 pc is @xmath82 g @xmath7 or @xmath83 @xmath7 .",
    "contrary to the previous studies using excitation analysis , we conclude that the mean gas density inferred from the virial analysis is close to or exceeding the critical density for surviving the tidal shear if they are self - gravitating .",

    "the new higher resolution 10-field mosaic observations of hco@xmath10 and hcn emission by @xcite suggest even higher mean density ( @xmath85 @xmath7 ) for these dense neutral clumps .",

    ", however , a comparison suggests that the line emission is significantly clumpier than the continuum , especially in the western arc .",
    "the central bar is also clumpier in the line emission .",
    "in addition , in the northern arm the line emission appears brighter than anywhere else with an increasing trend toward sgr a@xmath2 .",
    "these differences may not be intrinsic to the source .",
    "a lower signal - to - noise ratio in the line image probably accounts for some of the differences .",

    "the explanation by @xcite is the former , but a careful analysis using the actual measurements of the extremely blueshifted line by @xcite revealed that the missed flux alone can not fully account for the low l / c ratio .",
