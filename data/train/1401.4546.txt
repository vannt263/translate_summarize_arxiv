    "the recent discovery of the pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite has set rigid constraints on various matter equations of state ( eos ) for neutron stars at high densities .",
    "there are other indications in favor of the existence of massive neutron stars : @xmath2 for vela x-1 @xcite and @xmath3 for 4u 1822 - 371 @xcite .",
    "in particular , this new limits on maximal mass of neutron star excluded many eos , including hyperons and/or quarks eos . according to the experimental data @xcite and realistic models for strong interactions , the appearance of exotic particles occurs at densities @xmath4 g/@xmath5 .",
    "however , the hyperonisation softens eos and the maximal allowable mass is reduced considerably @xcite .",
    "the neutron stars with @xmath6 can not be obtained in the framework of thomas - fermi model for non - uniform matter @xcite with hyperon inclusion @xcite or a quark - hadron phase transition @xcite .",
    "the solution of such a `` _ hyperonization puzzle _ '' can be searched , in principle , by constructing the hyperon eos giving the maximal mass of neutron star around @xmath3 .",
    "the required stiffness of the eos can be achieved in relativistic mean field theory ( rmf ) with hyperon - vector coupling larger than it follows from @xmath7 symmetry models @xcite .",
    "a model with chiral quark - meson coupling with @xmath8 has been recently considered @xcite .",
    "the quartic vector - meson terms in the lagrangian also lead to the stiffening of eos and large neutron star mass @xcite .",
    "the radius measurements of neutron stars could give more information about eos for dense matter .",
    "unfortunately , one has no such measurements for any neutron stars with a precise mass determination . nevertheless , there are some astrophysical observations that could lead to the extraction of neutron star radii @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , based on data for radii and masses of three neutron stars ( in exo 1745 - 248 @xcite , in 4u 1608 - 52 @xcite and in 4u 1820 - 30 @xcite ) , the eos with only nucleonic degrees ( such as ap4 , mp1 ) are too stiff at higher density .",
    "a softer eos describes these data with better precision . in fig . 1 these data and the theoretical @xmath9 relation for some hyperon eos are shown .",
    "we give this relation for simple model with hyperons , proposed by glendenning and moszkowski ( gm - model with three parameterizations , gm1 - 3 , see@xcite for details ) .",
    "for illustration we also include the eos with quarks ( pcnphq ) .",
    "the following feature is obvious : although soft hyperon eos predict the maximal value of mass @xmath10 , these eos are more compatible with data by @xcite .",
    "+    in ref.@xcite , it is shown that , in the case of hyperonic matter with three exchange meson fields , the maximal mass is achieved only for low values of the effective nucleon mass .",
    "the addition of strange meson @xmath11 allows to increase the maximal value of effective mass .",
    "therefore , for the explanation of the new maximal limit of neutron star mass , one needs to complicate the simple @xmath12-model .",
    "in fact , this complication leads to the stiff hyperon eos which are close to pure nucleonic eos ( such as mp1 ) and we have contradiction with the data in @xcite .",
    "one note also that studying of longer x - ray bursts @xcite , @xcite gives the relatively large radii ( @xmath13 km ) for masses @xmath14 .",
    "this can say in favor to models with simple hyperon eos which predict radii @xmath15 km for @xmath16 stars .",
    "however these models do nt give the required upper mass limit .",
    "one can assume that such contradictions can be considered as a further indication in favor of the necessity to re - examine gravity theory at the early / late universe or in strong field regimes .",
    "the initial motivation for this approach has been pursued starting from the observed accelerated expansion of the early / late universe .",
    "this fact has been confirmed by observations data .",
    "first of all , type ia supernovae point out an accelerated expansion which can not be obtained by standard perfect fluid matter as the source for the cosmological friedman - robertson - walker equations @xcite .",
    "second , one can mention the observations of microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) anisotropy @xcite , of cosmic shear through gravitational weak leasing surveys @xcite and , finally , data coming from lyman alpha forest absorption lines @xcite . to explain the universe acceleration within general relativity ( gr )",
    ", one needs to postulate the existence of some cosmic fluid with negative pressure ( dark energy ) . in the framework of @xmath17cdm model",
    ", dark energy is nothing else but the einstein cosmological constant and its density is about 70% of the global energy budget of the universe .",
    "the remaining 30% , clustered in galaxies and clusters of galaxies , should be constituted only for about 4% by baryons and for the rest by cold dark matter ( cdm ) the nature of which is , up to now , unclear .    despite of the simplicity and the good agreement with observational data ,",
    "the @xmath18cdm model has some fundamental problems at theoretical level .",
    "for example , one needs to explain the difference of 120 orders of magnitude between its observed value at cosmological level and the one predicted by quantum field theory / gravity @xcite .    from another viewpoint , the accelerated expansion of the universe ( without dark components ) maybe naturally explained by modification of gravity at the very early and very late universe .",
    "indeed , modified gravity may provide viable gravitational candidate for dark energy ( see refs .",
    "@xcite as well as for unification of dark energy and early - time inflation@xcite ( for recent review of modified gravity , see @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that such theories give models which are able to reproduce the hubble diagram derived from snela observations @xcite and the anisotropies of cmbr @xcite .    addressing the problem of exotic relativistic stars in modified gravity , in comparison with gr , could represent a testbed for modified gravity .",
    "for example , some models of @xmath0 gravity do not allow the existence of stable star configurations @xcite and thus are considered unrealistic .",
    "however the existence of stable star configurations can be achieved in certain cases due to the so - called _ chameleon mechanism _",
    "@xcite or may depend on the chosen eos .    in this paper",
    ", we present the models of neutron star for simple hyperon eos with maximal mass @xmath19 in the framework of analytic @xmath0 models .",
    "we show that it is possible to address simultaneously the maximal value of neutron star mass as well as fit the data by @xcite assuming a hyperon eos for dense matter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we investigate the field equations for @xmath0 gravity and the modified tolman  oppenheimer  volkoff ( tov ) equations",

    "the analysis shows that there is a set of parameters ( @xmath127 ; @xmath113 ) at which we have the same @xmath9 relation .",
    "hence , analytical @xmath0 gravity models with quadratic and cubic terms may provide the resolution of neutron star maximal mass and hyperonization puzzle problems , being consistent , at the same time , with the m - r diagram .",
    "in summary , we presented a possible solution of the `` hyperonization puzzle '' in the neutron star theory .",
    "the softening of nucleon eos , due to hyperonization , leads to the decrease of the upper limit mass of neutron star considerably below the two solar masses ( in the simple model of hyperonic matter with realistic parameters ) according to gr .",
    "however , in modified @xmath0 gravity model with cubic and quadratic terms , it is possible to obtain neutron stars with @xmath114 for simple eos from gm2 and gm3 model extended to hyperon sector . of course , modified gravity under consideration is chosen to be in power - law analytic form as a simple example .",
    "however , the preliminary estimations indicate that similar effect may be expected for viable modified gravities where the analysis is more detailed and realistic stellar models are considered . note also that power - law @xmath0 models are the standard approximation for more complicated non - linear @xmath0 gravities .",
    "however , it is important to point out that the mass - radius relation significantly differs from gr only at high central densities . as consequence ,",
    "the `` effective '' eos is sufficiently soft to describe the radii and masses measurements for the three observed neutron stars exo 1745 - 248 , 4u 1608 - 52 and 4u 1820 - 30 .",
    "in other words , the same modified gravity may solve simultaneously three problems of neutron stellar astrophysics : maximal mass of neutron star , realistic mass - radius relation and hyperonization puzzle .    however , some final important remarks are useful at this point .",
    "the hyperonization puzzle can also be solved by considering alternatives to the @xmath7 model which prescribes particular relations between the hyperon - meson and nucleon - meson couplings . because the nature and coupling of the light sigma meson is not known , it is most natural to look for improving this meson model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another solution is that the hyperonic matter appears only at intermediate densities and the formation of quark cores supports hypernuclear stars agains collapse ( see @xcite .",
    "it should be clear that there is enough room in the nuclear theory which , combining conventional gravity , can allow for massive stars . of course",
    "this does not exclude alternative gravity as a possible solution of the problem .    as a next step",
    ", we will extend our results to non - perturbative treatment of tov equations .",
    "however , up to now , it seems a very hard problem ( see , for instance,@xcite ) which may need the development of qualitatively new numerical methods due to higher - derivative structure of @xmath0 gravity and necessity to account for _ chameleon effects _ as well as quantum gravity effects at very high densities ."
