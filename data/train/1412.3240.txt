    "as a series of advanced detectors such as ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , and kagra  @xcite is going to become operational in the next five years , we are likely to witness soon the first direct detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "the sources that are likely to be detected first are obviously the strongest ones and , in particular , the inspiral and post - merger of neutron - star binaries or neutron - star@xmath0black - hole binaries , and binary black holes .",
    "although an uncertainty as large as 3 orders of magnitude accompanies the estimates coming from population - synthesis models , it is widely assumed that binary neutron star ( bns ) mergers will represent the most common source , with an expected detection rate of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "in addition to being excellent sources of gws , the merger of a bns system represents also the most attractive scenario to explain the phenomenology associated with short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) . while suggested already in the 1980s  @xcite , the recent progress of numerical simulations  @xcite and the wealth of additional astronomical simulations ( see @xcite for a recent review ) has put this scenario on firm ground . over the years",
    ", these simulations have shown that the merger of bnss inevitably leads to the formation of a massive metastable object , which can either collapse promptly or survive up to a fraction of a second emitting large amounts of gravitational radiation .",
    "if the nss comprising the binary have large magnetic fields and extended magnetospheres the inspiral can be accompanied by a precursor electromagnetic signal  @xcite , while the merger can lead to instabilities  @xcite and to the formation of magnetically confined jet structures once a torus is formed around the black hole ( bh )  @xcite . the coincident detection of an electromagnetic and gw emission would represent the most convincing evidence of the link between sgrbs and bnss .    any gw signal from a binary including",
    "a neutron star will contain important signatures of the equation of state ( eos ) of matter at nuclear densities . a first signature is represented by the tidal corrections to the orbital phase ;",
    "these are reasonably well understood analytically  @xcite and can be tracked accurately with advanced high - order numerical codes  @xcite .",
    "a second signature is instead related to the post - merger phase , where the object formed by the merger [ most likely a hypermassive neutron star ( hmns ) ] can emit gws in a narrow frequency range before collapsing to a bh  @xcite .",
    "the first detailed evidence that it is possible to extract information about the eos of nuclear matter by carefully investigating the spectral properties of the post - merger signal was provided by bauswein and janka  @xcite . after performing a large number of simulations using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code solving the einstein field equations assuming conformal flatness and employing a gw backreaction scheme within a post - newtonian approximation",
    ", they pointed out the presence of a peak at high - frequency in the spectrum ( dubbed @xmath2 ) and showed it correlated with the properties of the eos , e.g. ,  with the radius of the maximum - mass nonrotating configuration ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a subsequent general - relativistic study ) .",
    "the correlation found was rather tight , but restricted to binaries having all the same total mass of @xmath3 .",
    "it was later recognized that @xmath2 corresponds to a fundamental fluid mode with @xmath4 of the hmns  @xcite and that the information from this frequency could also be used to set constraints on the maximum mass of the system and hence on the eos  @xcite .    following this bulk of work ,",
    "we have recently presented in ref .",
    "@xcite a new approach in which the detection of gws from merging bnss can be used to determine the eos of matter at nuclear density and hence the structure of neutron stars . more specifically , making use of a large number of accurate numerical - relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear eoss and different masses , we have shown that the post - merger emission is characterized by two distinct and robust spectral features .",
    "the high - frequency of these two peaks is the same already discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , but we have also revealed that the correlations with the stellar properties depend on the total mass of the system and hence on the eos . on the other hand , we have also shown that the low - frequency peak is related to the merger process and related to the total compactness of the stars in the binary .",
    "this relation is essentially universal and provides a powerful tool to set tight constraints on the eos .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide additional information on the extensive analysis performed and presented in  @xcite , illustrating the methods used , the tests considered , as well as the robustness of the results . besides describing in greater detail the spectral properties discussed above",
    ", we also discuss additional correlations that either have been already discussed in the literature , e.g. ,  in refs .",
    "@xcite , or that are presented here for the first time . an important aspect of this paper is also that of presenting a simple mechanical toy model that can explain rather intuitively the main spectral features of the post - merger signal and shed light on the physical interpretation of the origin of the various peaks . despite its crudeness",
    ", the toy model can even reproduce the complex waveforms emitted right after the merger , hence possibly opening the way to an analytical modeling of a part of the signal that has been so far considered impossible to model but with numerical - relativity calculations .",
    "the waveforms are freely available for download and further analysis  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we use a spacelike signature @xmath9 and a system of units in which @xmath10 unless stated differently .",
    "much of the numerical setup used in these simulations has been presented in greater detail in other papers  @xcite , and for compactness we will review here only the basic aspects , referring the interested reader to the papers above for additional information .",
    "all of our simulations have been performed in full general relativity using a fourth - order finite - differencing code ` mclachlan `  @xcite , which solves a conformal traceless formulation of the einstein equations  @xcite , with a `` @xmath11 '' slicing condition and a `` gamma - driver '' shift condition  @xcite . at the same time , the general - relativistic hydrodynamics equations are solved using the finite - volume code ` whisky `  @xcite , which has been extensively tested in simulations involving the inspiral and merger of bnss  @xcite .",
    "we note that differently from previous works of ours , e.g. ,  @xcite , but also from those of other authors , e.g. ,  @xcite , we have not employed as approximate riemann solver the marquina flux formula  @xcite , which has been revealed to be problematic when used in conjunction with nuclear - physics eoss approximated as piecewise polytropes ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : eos ] ) .",
    "instead , we have employed the harten - lax - van leer - einfeldt ( hlle )  @xcite approximate riemann solver  @xcite , which is less accurate but more robust , in conjunction with a piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) for the reconstruction of the evolved variables  @xcite .",
    "we also note that although we have recently developed a new code , i.e. ,  ` whiskythc ` , able to reach high - order convergence  @xcite , we have not employed it here mostly because our focus is on the post - merger dynamics , where the large scale shocks reduce the accuracy of both codes to first order , and for which ` whisky ` appears to be slightly more robust .    for the time integration of the coupled set of the hydrodynamic and einstein equations",
    "we have used the method of lines ( mol ) in conjunction with an explicit fourth - order runge - kutta method  @xcite . in all our simulations",
    "we prescribe a courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) factor of @xmath12 to compute the size of the time step .",
    "to place the outer boundary at sufficiently large distances and guarantee at the same high spatial resolution near the neutron stars , we employ an adaptive - mesh refinement ( amr ) approach which follows closely the one adopted in  @xcite . in practice , the grid hierarchy is handled by the ` carpet ` mesh - refinement driver  @xcite .",
    "it implements vertex - centered mesh refinement , also known as the box - in - box method , and allows for regridding during the calculation as well as multiple grid centers . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , within this approach a number of grids with different resolutions , called refinement levels , overlay each other , and are nested in such a way that the coarsest grid has the largest extent and the finest grid the smallest extent .",
    "the time step on each grid is set by the courant condition and so by the spatial grid resolution for that level .",
    "boundary data for finer grids are calculated with spatial prolongation operators employing fifth - order polynomials and with prolongation in time employing second - order polynomials .    during the inspiral phase ,",
    "the positions of the centers of the two highest - resolution grids are determined by the location of the maximum of the rest - mass density .",
    "one grid is placed at the grid point correspondent to @xmath13 and the other at the @xmath14-symmetric point , namely the point obtained by a rotation of @xmath15 deg around the @xmath16 axis for equal - mass binaries .",
    "the grid hierarchy is composed of six refinement levels and a @xmath17 refinement factor for successive levels .",
    "the grid resolution varies from @xmath18 ( i.e. ,  @xmath19 ) for the finest level to @xmath20 ( i.e. ,  @xmath21 ) for the coarsest level , whose outer boundary is at @xmath22 ( i.e. ,  @xmath23 ) .",
    "initially , the number of grid points across the linear dimension of a star is of the order of @xmath24 , while these become roughly twice when the merger has taken place and a hmns has been formed .",
    "the whole grid is set up to be symmetric with respect to the @xmath25 plane both for equal- and unequal - mass binaries , with a reflection symmetry across the @xmath26 plane to reduce computational costs .",
    "additionally , a @xmath14-symmetry condition across the @xmath27 plane is adopted in the case of equal - mass binaries to further reduce the cost .",
    "the boundary conditions are chosen to be radiative for the metric to prevent gravitational waves from scattering back into the grid , and static for the hydrodynamical variables .",
    "no matter reaches the outer boundary over the time scale of the simulations .",
    "we model the stars with nuclear - physics eoss by considering five different eos models : i.e. ,  apr4  @xcite , alf2  @xcite , sly  @xcite , h4  @xcite , and gnh3  @xcite .",
    "we note that all of these eoss satisfy the current observational constraint on the observed maximum mass in neutron stars , i.e. ,  @xmath28 obtained for the pulsar psr j0348 + 0432  @xcite . in order to cover a range in stellar compactness that is larger than the one spanned by the above five nuclear eoss",

    "@xcite for details ) .    instead of using tables for the various eoss ,",
    "we have found it simpler and more convenient to reproduce each eos in terms of a number @xmath33 of piecewise polytropes  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the `` cold '' and nuclear - physics contribution to each eos is obtained after expressing the pressure and specific internal energy @xmath34 in the rest - mass density range @xmath35 as @xmath36 in addition , we impose the continuity of pressure and specific internal energy through the following conditions @xmath37 for @xmath38 .    -0.75",

    "after contact , however , large shocks will develop , considerably increasing the internal energy . to account for this additional heating we could use hot nuclear - physics eoss , which provide information about the dependence of the pressure and density also as a function of temperature . in practice",
    ", however , the number of such eoss is still pretty limited , thus preventing us from doing a systematic investigation . as a result , we follow  @xcite and account for thermal effects by using a so - called `` hybrid eos ''  @xcite , that is , by adding to the cold part an ideal - fluid component that accounts for the shock heating  @xcite . in practice the total pressure and specific internal energy are expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 are given by eqs .   and , while the `` thermal '' part is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is arbitrary but constrained mathematically to be @xmath47 .",

    "the choice of a fixed time interval was made to facilitate the comparison of the detectability across different models . for most models ,",
    "this interval includes most of the post - merger signal , but only a few orbits of the inspiral .",

    "note that a smaller power in the @xmath5 peak is compensated by a smaller detector noise at lower frequencies , so that the snrs at the frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath61 differ at most by a factor of 3 and are even comparable for some binaries .",

    "the fisher matrix is the inverse of the covariance matrix , so it can be used to estimate the uncertainties on the parameters of the model .",
    "one of these assumptions is that , given a _ fiducial _ model , the fisher matrix does not change too much if a different model is considered .",
    "namely , the fisher matrix error estimate is valid for models near the fiducial model  @xcite .    in practice",

    "the denominator of expression   is the snr of the difference of the signals of the two models .    neglecting correlations between the peak frequencies and other parameters , we list in table  [ tab : fisher_f1_f2 ] the errors estimated in this way for selected models , namely equal - mass models with the average gravitational mass at infinite separation @xmath86 and all the eoss we simulated .",
    "as mentioned , the fisher matrix method is valid only for models near the _ correct _ model , so the values in table  [ tab : fisher_f1_f2 ] for models whose frequencies are very different are not particularly meaningful and are reported only for completeness . in any case",
    ", the errors computed using only the post - merger phase are of the order of @xmath76-@xmath87 and thus compatible with the estimates of @xcite .",
    "making use of a large number of accurate and fully general - relativistic simulations of the inspiral and merger of bnss with nuclear eoss , we have illustrated in detail the spectral properties of the post - merger gw signal , extending and complementing the information already provided in  @xcite and in other papers that have looked at these properties  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we have shown that correlations exist between the two largest peak frequencies in the psd of the post - merger signal ( i.e. ,  @xmath88 ) and the physical properties of the nss composing the binary system ( i.e. ,  mass , radius and their combinations ) .",
    "one of these correlations , namely , that of the low - frequency peak @xmath5 with compactness @xmath89 , is rather tight and has all the properties of being quasiuniversal ; that is , it has a functional behavior that does not depend on the eos . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - frequency peak @xmath61 shows correlations , either with the average density or with the radius of a nonrotating star with a mass of @xmath90 , that are far less tight and depend on the eos .",
    "we have shown that exploiting the information coming from both of these frequencies , together with the knowledge of the total mass of the binary , a potential detection of the post - merger gw signal at the large snr ratio can set tight constraints on the eos of matter at nuclear densities . while in principle a single observation would be sufficient , in practice the uncertainties in the measurements of the peaks and the errors in the fitting of the various correlations will require a number of positive and high - snr detections for the robust identification of the eos .",
    "an interesting side product of this work is also the construction of a simple mechanical toy model that can explain rather intuitively the main spectral features of the post - merger signal and shed light on the physical interpretation of the origin of the various peaks . despite its crudeness , the toy model can reproduce reasonably well the complex waveforms emitted right after the merger .",
    "the exciting prospects opened in this work call for a number of future improvements .",
    "first , it remains to be determined how robust the results found here are when realistic spins in the nss are accounted for , or when the dynamics is extended to an ideal - magnetohydrodynamics ( ideal - mhd ) description  @xcite .",
    "second , the phenomenology discussed here will need to be studied also when fully three - dimensional eoss are considered , or in more extreme regimes of unequal - mass ratios .",
    "third , the potential of the toy model presented here in predicting the post - merger signal needs to be further developed and validated .",
    "last but not least , a proper assessment of the errors associated with the measurements of the stellar radii will require a complete bayesian analysis of the probability that the constraints coming from the measurement of the two peak frequencies and of the total mass are satisfied simultaneously .",

    "<S> extending previous work by a number of authors , we have recently presented a new approach in which the detection of gravitational waves from merging neutron star binaries can be used to determine the equation of state of matter at nuclear density and hence the structure of neutron stars . in particular , after performing a large number of numerical - relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state , we have found that the post - merger emission is characterized by two distinct and robust spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> while the high - frequency peak was already shown to be associated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by the merger and to depend on the equation of state , we have highlighted that the low - frequency peak is related to the merger process and to the total compactness of the stars in the binary . </S>",
    "<S> this relation is essentially universal and provides a powerful tool to set tight constraints on the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> we here provide additional information on the extensive analysis performed , illustrating the methods used , the tests considered , as well as the robustness of the results . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss additional relations that can be deduced when exploring the data and how these correlate with various properties of the binary . finally , we present a simple mechanical toy model that explains the main spectral features of the post - merger signal and can even reproduce analytically the complex waveforms emitted right after the merger . </S>"
