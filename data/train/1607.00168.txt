    "since the beginning of quantum theory a century ago , the study of the frontier between classical and quantum mechanics has been a constant topic of debate  @xcite . in our opinion ,",
    "the difficulties in the progress of this debate are also due to the deep - rooted use of different languages in classical and quantum mechanics : while classical system are usually described using trajectories  @xcite , quantum descriptions involve wave functions  @xcite .",
    "these two languages are so different that it is hard ( and sometimes misleading ) to directly compare trajectories and wave functions . but",
    "despite its pervasiveness , this clash of languages can be avoided by using other readily available formulations , where both theories can be compared on an equal footing .",
    "for instance , bohmian mechanics provides a deterministic description of quantum systems where particles have definite positions , and their trajectories are _ choreographed _ by the wave function  @xcite . on the other hand , ensembles of classical particles can be described in terms of waves using the hamilton ",

    "jacobi formulation  @xcite .",
    "we will notice that a single - valued condition on the hamiltons principal function is assumed during such development .",
    "this additional assumption implies that the trajectories can not cross in configuration space , which leads to unexpected non - classical features not present in the newtonian formalism . as a conclusion ,",
    "there are inherent non - classical features on the dynamics of the classical schrdinger equation .    in the second part of the paper , in section sec .",
    "[ sec : bm ] , we analyze different paths to arrive to the classical schrdinger equation from quantum systems by invoking the quantum - to - classical transition within the bohmian formalism .",
    "in particular , we show that the center of mass of quantum systems with a very large number of identical particles tends to behave classically , following the classical schrdinger equation mentioned above .",
    "we notice that this second derivation demands a very narrow wave packet .",
    "this additional requirement avoids the inherent non - classical features mentioned in the first part of the paper for the classical schrdinger equation .    in sec .",

    "[ sec : sunival ] discusses one of the relevant topics of this work : the requirement to the reach the classical schrdinger equation is a single - valued hamilton s principal function .      according to classical mechanics  @xcite , after specifying the initial position and velocity , the trajectory @xmath0 $ ] of a particle",

    "the velocity in a physical point depends , not only on the point itself , but also on the particle . in other words",
    ", two different particles can have two different values of their velocity @xmath11 ( i.e. two different values of hamilton s principal function @xmath12 ) at one unique point of physical space @xmath10 .",
    "in general , finding the direct solution of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltoncla ] ) is more difficult than solving newton law in eq .",
    "( [ newtoncla ] ) .",
    "one of the great merits of the hamilton - jacobi formalism is its ability to arrive to a wave formulation of classical systems .",
    "although it describes the dynamics of a classical particle in 1d physical space , the hamilton s principal function @xmath13 is defined mathematically as a function in a 2-dimensional ( plus time ) space . on the contrary , for example , the ( wave ) function that describes the dynamics of a quantum particle in a 1d physical space , @xmath14 ,",
    "is indeed defined in position - time dimensional space .",
    "therefore , in order to connect the classical and quantum world , one is tempted to use the function @xmath15 neglecting its dependence on @xmath9 , to describe classical systems within a wave formulation .",
    "we will see that this elimination has dramatic consequences on the ability of the classical schrdinger equation to correctly model classical dynamics .",
    "once we neglect @xmath9 , the particle s velocity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_cl1 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath16 we emphasize that the new equation eq .",

    "there is only one possible velocity in @xmath10 for all particles .",

    "( [ newtoncla ] ) , to the classical schrdinger equation , eq .",
    "( [ 1schocla ] ) , we have made an additional ( and usually unnoticed ) but critical assumption .",
    "we have assumed that hamilton s principal function @xmath7 becomes a single - valued function ( having all velocities of an ensemble of particles the same velocity in each position @xmath10 ) .",
    "let us explain with detail the critical problem mentioned here .",
    "newton s second law can be used to describe any trajectory occurring in a given experiment .",
    "we can therefore use it to describe one experiment defined by a trajectory @xmath0 $ ] and another realization of the same experiment with a different trajectory @xmath25 $ ] .",

    "( [ eq : v_cl ] ) for the same action function .",
    "the use of the wave function implicitly assumes that @xmath15 is single - valued , which in turn implies that different trajectories ( described by the same @xmath15 ) will not cross in the physical ( configuration ) space .",
    "however , in newtonian mechanics , trajectories actually cross with each other .",
    "this fact is intimately related with how a distribution of positions and momenta in a classical ensemble is represented with the classical schrdinger equation .",
    "not any general probability distribution of positions and momenta , e.g. , @xmath26 , can be represented with this formalism , as the it imposes a very strong restriction on the momenta . in order for the classical wave function to have a well - defined single - valued phase ,",
    "each position is only allowed to have a single momentum ( the momentum is obtained from the derivative of the phase of the wave function ) . therefore",

    "the presence of @xmath23 in the quantum versions of the hamilton ",

    "we follow here his single - particle arguments . comparing eqs .",
    "( [ newtoncla ] ) and ( [ newton ] ) it is easy to see that bohmian trajectories with classical behavior can be obtained by imposing  @xcite @xmath55 i.e. , that @xmath23 is constant everywhere .",
    "this strategy to reach a classical equation , however , can be quite problematic because most of the time it is incompatible with a well - defined wave function solution of eq .",
    "( [ 1scho ] ) .",
    "the reason is because we have three equations , eqs .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) , ( [ conservation ] ) and ( [ quantumpotentialzero ] ) , imposed on only two unknowns , @xmath20 and @xmath15 .",

    "this equation has the virtue that for intermediate values of @xmath60 allows the study of the appearance of quantum behavior as @xmath64 becomes more and more relevant ( and thus the system becomes more classical ) .",
    "however , an explanation of the origin or physical meaning of @xmath60 is still missing in the literature .      in what follows",
    "we summarize our recent work on the quantum - to - classical transition through a generalization of rosen s attempt  @xcite by analyzing the dynamics of the center of mass of a many - particle system with a large number of identical particles  @xcite .",
    "we show that classicality appears as a _",
    "natural _ quantum limit of the center of mass of most macroscopic objects , i.e. the effect of the quantum potential associated to the center of mass becomes negligible while still retaining a well - defined wave function .",
    "we start by providing some simple arguments on why it is better to formulate the quantum - to - classical transition in terms of the center of mass rather than in terms of individual particles .",
    "first , it is important to notice that a center of mass of a quantum object can have a classical behavior , while the fundamental particles that form the object ( and used to compute the center of mass ) are still fully quantum .",
    "second , it can be shown that the quantum potential of the center of mass is the sum of the quantum potentials of the particles of the quantum object ( which can take positive and negative values ) .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the value of the quantum potential averaged over a large number of particles will tend to become small ( even if the effect of the quantum potential in each particle is not negligible ) . let us emphasize the quantum potential acting on a particle is , in general , much more complex than the classical potential .",
    "therefore , the averaged classical potential over the object will basically remain equal to the classical potential assigned to one particle , while the averaged quantum potential tends to be much smaller .",
    "finally , by looking the quantum - to - classical transition through the center of mass of a large number of particles , we are imposing a `` natural '' type of coarse - grained procedure : only macroscopic objects ( whose center of mass involves a very large number of particles ) will become classical .",
    "after these qualitative arguments , next we briefly summarize our work of ref .",
    "we consider a quantum system defined by the many particle wave function @xmath65 where @xmath66 for @xmath67 are the positions of @xmath68 particles with mass @xmath2 .",
