    "in general , the collapse occurs anisotropically and is driven by the dipoles seeking to line up end - to - end for @xmath58 and side - by - side for @xmath35 . in the case of adiabatic collapse , where the ground state solutions are followed up until the instant of collapse , we observe both global and local collapse . in the range @xmath249",

    "the increase of @xmath12 was sufficiently slow to ensure that global collapse dominates the system .",

    "a rich variety of structures can be formed depending upon the orientation of the dipoles and the aspect ratio of the trap .",
    "these structures are related to those that have been predicted to occur in the ground state , but during local collapse they become amplified .",
    "such transient structures could be observed experimentally by bragg scattering of light .",

    "<S> the long - range nature of dipolar interactions means that the gross - pitaevskii wave equation that governs the bec is not only non - linear but also non - local @xcite . on top of being long - range , </S>",
    "<S> dipolar interactions are also anisotropic , being attractive in certain directions and repulsive in others . </S>",

    "<S> the depth of the minimum is tunable via microscopic parameters such as the dipolar and _ s_-wave interaction strengths . </S>",
    "<S> an important physical consequence of the `` roton '' minimum is that it can lead to density modulations in the ground state dipolar bec @xcite . </S>",
