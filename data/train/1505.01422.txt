    "cooperative communication increases the performance quality of communication systems in terms of capacity , outage probability and symbol error probability ( sep ) dramatically .",
    "two main relaying protocols that have been researched a lot , are amplify - and - forward ( af ) and decode - and - forward ( df )  @xcite . in  @xcite performance of af and df protocols in terms of outage probability and sep have been widely investigated over nakagami-_m _ and rayleigh fading channels .    in cooperative communication networks ,",
    "the use of multiple relays to facilitate the source - destination communication was proposed to increase the spatial diversity gain  @xcite . to avoid the",
    "interfering , source and all the relay transmissions must take place on orthogonal channels .",
    "thus multiple relay cooperation is considered inefficient in terms of channel resources and bandwidth utilization . to overcome this problem , opportunistic relaying ( or )",
    "has been proposed at which only the best - relay from a set of @xmath0 available relays is selected to participate in communication  @xcite . it was shown that or achieves full diversity order . with this technique ,",
    "the selection strategy is to choose the relay with the best equivalent end - to - end channel gain which is obtained as the highest minimum of the channel gains of the first and the second hops under df protocol or with the best harmonic mean of both channel gains under af protocol  @xcite .    in  @xcite performance of",
    "log - normal fading channels over different structures and relaying protocols has been investigated . from the practical point of view , log - normal distribution is encountered in many communication scenarios .",
    "for instance , when indoor communication is used at which users are moving , log - normal distribution not only models the moving objects , but also the reflection of the bodies .",
    "moreover , it models the action of communicating with robots in a closed environment like a factory  @xcite . in indoor radio propagation environments ,",
    "terminals with low mobility have to rely on macroscopic diversity to overcome the shadowing from indoor obstacles and moving human bodies .",
    "indeed , in such slowly varying channels , the small - scale and large - scale effects tend to get mixed . in this case",
    ", log - normal statistics accurately describe the distribution of the channel path gain  @xcite .",
    "a main underlying assumption in majority of the current literature on cooperative communication is the availability of the channel state information ( csi ) at the receiver .",
    "recently there has been an interest in evaluation the performance of relay networks over imperfect channels @xcite .",
    "performance analysis of opportunistic af and df schemes over log - normal channels is a non - trivial task when the csi is imperfectly known at all nodes . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there have been no reported results on the outage probability analysis of such a systems yet .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to derive closed - form expressions for the outage probability of the multi - relay df and af systems , employing `` best - worst '' and `` best harmonic mean '' relay selection criteria over imperfect log - normal fading channels , respectively .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : system_model ] describes the system model .",
    "section  [ sec : model estim ] , discusses the gaussian error model for imperfect channel estimation .",
    "we take advantage of this model in our relay selection scenario to obtain output instantaneous snr .",
    "section  [ sec : perfo analy ] provides the harmonic mean of two log - normal random variables ( r.v ) for af and the equivalent cdf of the best - worse selection criterion for df in order to calculate outage probability .",
    "section  [ sec : num res ] presents simulation results , while section  [ sec : con ] provides some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a multi - relay scenario , in which a source node ( s ) communicates to a destination node ( d ) via multiple fixed relays @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that there is no direct link between the source and the destination , and communication occurs using a two - hop protocol over two time slots@xcite .",
    "the fading coefficient over source to relay @xmath2 , and relay @xmath2 to destination are denoted with @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are assumed to be independent and non - identically distributed log - normal r.vs . dropping the indexes , channel gains during the transmission of a bit",
    "are modeled by @xmath5 , at which @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes a gaussian distribution . during the first time slot , source broadcasts the signal to @xmath0 relays . in the second time slot , only the best - relay forwards the signal to the destination , and source remains idle .",
    "let us denote with @xmath8 the power transmitted by the source and thus the set of below equations summarize the operation taking place for each symbol @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the transmitted signal with power @xmath11=1 $ ] , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are complex additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) in the relay and destination , respectively . without loss of generality , we assume that all the awgn terms have equal variance as @xmath14 . for af relaying @xmath15 at which relay amplification factor , @xmath16 , is chosen to satisfy an average power constraint and will be defined later . for df relaying @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is obtained after demodulating @xmath19 followed by modulating for retransmit to the destination .",
    "therefore , in brief we study the or  @xcite with two conventional relaying strategies at the relay :    * * df * : the best - relay decodes the message , re - encodes it and transmits that message in next time slot .",
    "* * af * : in the second time slot the best - relay process the received signal and forwards it to the destination .    in the sequel we investigate the performance of or - df and or - af schemes over log - normal fading channels where relay and destination are provided with a estimation of their corresponding channels .      in the second time slot , for df scheme",
    ", only the best - relay according to the best - worse criterion  @xcite is chosen to decode and re - encode the received signal which yields @xmath18 .",
    "then the selected @xmath20 relay send @xmath17 to the destination where @xmath21 is the relay power . as a result",
    "the received signal at the destination is given by @xmath22      under af protocol the relay with the best harmonic mean of both source to relay and relay to destination gains is chosen to forward @xmath15 to destination  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath23 , asserts the relay amplification factor which controls the output power of the relay  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath16 depends on the fading coefficient , each relay has to estimate its own received channel .",
    "we assume that relays estimate their corresponding channels , @xmath24 , and then use it to amplify the received signal .",
    "the received signal at the destination is of the form @xmath25 armed with these system models , in the consecutive sections we model the imperfect csi at the receiving nodes , and then study the performance of aforementioned af and df schemes with relay selection , in term of outage probability .",
    "we denote the estimated and exact channel coefficients as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . to estimate the h linearly with respect to @xmath26 , we employ the following model  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the channel estimation error modeled by zero mean complex gaussian distribution with variance @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the correlation coefficient between @xmath27 and @xmath26 which is given by @xmath32  @xcite",
    ". the variances of the error and the exact channel coefficient are related by @xmath31 as @xmath33 since estimated channel is the combination of a log - normal and a complex gaussian r.v , it s pdf does not exactly follow a log - normal distribution .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : num res ] we will show that when the correlation coefficient between the estimated channel and the real one is near to one ( , @xmath34 ) , this approximation is acceptable . by employing the imperfect channel estimations at the receiving node we obtain a closed - form expressions for instantaneous snr at the destination .      substituting into and",
    ", we have @xmath35 after receiving the signal in the @xmath20 relay , since the noise power is not the same on all sub - channels , each diversity branch has to be weighted by its corresponding complex fading gain over total noise power on that particular branch .",
    "therefore , the selected relay and the destination will decode the received signal using mrc as  @xcite @xmath36 then using  , instantaneous snr at the relay and destination can be formulated as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .      remembering that our transmission model for af scheme is given by  , substituting into",

    ", we neglect @xmath49 in .",
    "so , we can further simplify as    -0.5 cm @xmath50    @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "in this section we derive closed - form expressions for outage probability of the or scheme under af and df protocols .",
    "outage probability is defined as the probability that the instantaneous snr at the receiver , @xmath58 , falls below a predetermined protection ratio , @xmath59 , namely @xmath60=\\int_{0}^{\\gamma_{th } }        f_{\\upsilon}(\\gamma)d\\gamma.\\label{p_out}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 represent the pdf of the instantaneous snr .",
    "it can readily be seen that the outage probability is actually the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath58 evaluated at @xmath59 . before proceeding , we introduce following theorems from  @xcite which will be used in the sequel to derive @xmath61 .",

    "the outage probability can be readily obtained as @xmath96 similar to df mode , using the independency of the branches , we arrive at @xmath97 which is the product of cdfs of @xmath98 .",
