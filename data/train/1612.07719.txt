    "one dimensional models in quantum mechanics are important because they are much more tractable and sometimes they are solvable , what makes them quite suitable for testing many properties and the behavior of a wide range of quantum systems . in particular , we may analyze the properties of quantum states . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics",
    ", we usually deal with four types of states : bound states , scattering states , resonance states and anti - bound also called virtual states .",
    "the present article focus its attention on the latter .",
    "since resonances and anti - bound states appear in resonance scattering , it is customary to use a characterization of both that relies on the properties of the analytic continuation into the complex plane of the scattering matrix ( @xmath0-matrix ) either in the momentum , @xmath1 , or in the energy representation , @xmath2 . in the sequel",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the momentum representation .",
    "while resonances are given by poles of any multiplicity located in the lower half plane symmetrically with respect to the imaginary axis , anti - bound states are given by simple poles on the negative imaginary axis @xcite .",
    "resonances and anti - bound states are particular cases of quantum transients @xcite .    physically , anti - bound states have been indirectly observed at low energy when scattering shows an anomalous large cross section @xcite .",
    "anti - bound states may also produce a long time delay , as shown in @xcite , chapter xviii .",
    "a typical example is the anti - bound state produced in the scattering neutron - proton @xcite , where a anti - bound of deuteron is produced .",
    "anti - bound states are also observed in nuclear physics . in this context , they usually manifest themselves by the capture of a neutron by some light nuclei , for instance , @xmath3li which is a typical example or @xmath4be @xcite . some further discussions on the physical properties of anti - bound states may be found in @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we show that the hyperbolic step potential has anti - bound states .",
    "because of its shape , this potential may be used as an approximation of the woods - saxon potential , which is a common device in different studies in nuclear physics @xcite . studies on the shell model with anti - bound states produced by the woods - saxon potential have appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is an important difference : the woods - saxon potential is accompanied by an impenetrable barrier at the origin , while the hyperbolic step potential is a genuine one dimensional potential defined for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the hyperbolic barrier potential is similar to a square barrier . in particular",
    ", it does not have bound states .",
    "instead , it has a rich structure of anti - bound states and this makes it particularly attractive .",
    "although experimentally observable anti - bound states are of low negative energy , in specific models poles of the analytic continuation of the s - matrix on the negative imaginary axis may have any negative energy value .",
    "this is the case of the one dimensional semi - oscillator with a contact potential at the origin @xcite or in the one dimensional hyperbolic pschl - teller potential @xcite .    in the energy representation ,",
    "anti - bound states are represented for poles in the analytic continuation of the @xmath0-matrix on the negative real axis in the second sheet of the two sheeted riemann surface corresponding to the transformation @xmath6 . as is the case with gamow states for resonances ,",
    "anti - bound states could be represented by non - normalizable eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian with negative real eigenvalues given by the real poles of the @xmath2 matrix on the second sheet @xcite .",
    "many models for resonance scattering showing resonances and anti - bound states require numerical approximations in order to find poles of @xmath1 , or equivalently of @xmath2 . in order to study relevant properties of these physical states , it would be important to find exactly solvable models for resonances and anti - bounds . in a recent paper @xcite , we have shown that this is the case for the hyperbolic pschl - teller potential .",
    "this exact solvability has permitted to show the existence of ladder operators connecting series of bound and anti - bound states as well as series of resonance states .",
    "the same is suspected to happen for a range of potentials of hypergeometric type @xcite .",
    "in addition exact solvability may be used for another purposes , like for instance to check the accuracy of numerical computational methods @xcite .",
    "the hyperbolic step model offers quite interesting features because of its asymmetric character . as a consequence of this asymmetry ,",
    "the matrix @xmath1 is not unitary , but instead it satisfies a somehow modified unitarity relation , as we shall see . in this case",
    ", the analytic continuation of the matrix @xmath1 has a branch cut , which is not present for symmetric asymptotic conditions .",
    "another outcome of the asymmetry is that this potential has two different values of the momentum @xmath7 and @xmath8 at asymptotic regions left and right , respectively .",
    "this implies , for instance , that in order to have bound ( or anti - bound ) states the corresponding conditions should be satisfied in both asymptotic regions : @xmath7 and @xmath8 must be in the positive imaginary ( or negative imaginary ) axis .    resonance and anti - bound states have been used for the construction of supersymmetric partners of a given hamiltonian @xcite . in general , to obtain a susy partner from a given initial potential , one uses eigenfunctions of such hamiltonian having specific properties @xcite . in our case , we will use just the wave functions of the anti - bound states in order to obtain a hierarchy of susy partners of the hyperbolic step potential called rosen morse ii potentials .",
    "after interacting with a potential in a collision process and being partially reflected and transmitted , a wave packet undergoes a time delay with respect to the time employed by the free motion .",
    "there are some methods to measure this time , one of the most common relies in the definition of the wigner time delay @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the wigner time delay for the hyperbolic step hamiltonian and some of its rosen morse ii partners .",
    "the absence of bound states for this hamiltonian and the existence of bound states for its partners affects the phase and time delay that can be measured .",
    "we have also compared these time delays with those obtained for a classical hyperbolic step potential .",
    "after this presentation , we summarize the organization of this article as follows . in section 2",
    ", we solve the schrdinger equation for the hyperbolic step potential and obtain the asymptotic solutions . in section 3",
    ", we analyze scattering properties of this potential , in particular we compute the anti - bound poles and states .",
    "we see that the asymptotic asymmetry of the potential leads to new analytic properties of the @xmath0-matrix elements .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the application of the factorization method to the hyperbolic step potential in order to find its susy partners derived from the eigenfunctions corresponding to the anti - bound states .",
    "next , in section 5 , we compute the phases and time delays for the hyperbolic step potential as well as for some of its partner potentials .",
    "these values can be computed analytically .",
    "finally , the paper ends with some conclusions and remarks .",
    "our first objective is an analysis of the hamiltonian with a hyperbolic step potential . to begin with",
    ", we find a solution in terms of hypergeometric functions .",
    "we also compute the scattering matrix in order to investigate the possible existence of bound and anti - bound states as well as resonances .",
    "the one dimensional hyperbolic step potential has the following form : @xmath9 the parameter @xmath10 is the barrier height . in order to figure out the shape of @xmath11 and to compare it with woods - saxon potential ,",
