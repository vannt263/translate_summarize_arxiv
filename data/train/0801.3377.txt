    "two - particle correlation functions , such as the dynamical spin- and charge correlation functions , determine a variety of crucial properties of many - body systems .",

    "furthermore , an effective way to identify continuous phase transitions is to search for divergencies of susceptibilities , i.e. two - particle correlation functions . yet , compared to studies of single - particle green s functions and their spectral properties , where a good overall accord between theoretical models ( hubbard type - models ) and experiment ( arpes ) has been established ( see refs .  ) , the situation is usually not so satisfying for two - particle green s functions .",
    "this is especially so for the case of correlated electron systems such as high-@xmath0 superconductors ( htsc ) .",
    "the primary reason for this is that calculations of these green s functions are , from a numerical point of view , much more involved .    to expose the problem",
    "let us consider the spin - susceptibility which is given by : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 corresponds to the lattice size , @xmath3 is the inverse temperature and @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the momentum and @xmath6 a ( bosonic ) matsubara frequency . to simplify the notation , we have adopted a path integral coherent state notation with grassman variables : @xmath7 the two - particle irreducible vertex , @xmath8 ,",

    "@xcite , which we consider in this paper , one can consistently define the two - particle green s functions , by extracting the irreducible vertex function from the cluster .",
    "this approximation maps the original lattice problem to a cluster of size @xmath10 embedded in a self - consistent host .",
    "thus , correlations up to a range @xmath11 are treated accurately , while the physics at longer length - scales is described at the mean - field level .",
    "the dca is conveniently formulated in momentum space , i.e. via a patching of the bz .",
    "let @xmath12 denote such a patch , and @xmath13 the original lattice momentum .",
    "the approximation boils down to restricting momentum conservation only to the patch wave vectors @xmath14 .",
    "this approximation is justified if @xmath15-space correlation functions are rather structureless and , thus , in real space short - ranged . from the technical point of view",
    ", the approximations are implemented via the laue function @xmath16 , which guarantees momentum conservation up to a reciprocal lattice vector . in the dca , the laue function",
    "is replaced by @xmath17 , thereby insuring momentum conservation only between the cluster momenta .",
    "it is understood that @xmath18 belongs to the patch @xmath19 .",
    "to define uniquely the dca approximation , in particular in view of two - particle quantities , it is useful to start with the luttinger - ward functional @xmath20 , which is computed using the dca laue function . hence , @xmath21 is a functional of a coarse - grained green s function , @xmath22 .",
    "irreducible quantities such as the self - energy , and the two - particle irreducible vertex are calculated on the cluster and correspond , respectively , to the first- and second - order functional derivatives of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "using the cluster irreducible self - energy , @xmath24 , and two - particle vertex , @xmath25 , one can then compute the lattice single - particle and lattice two - particle correlation functions using the dyson and bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "this construction of two - particle quantities has the appealing property that they are thermodynamically consistent@xcite .",
    "hence , the spin susceptibility as calculated using the particle - hole correlation functions corresponds precisely to the derivative of the magnetization with respect to an applied uniform static magnetic field .",
    "the technical aspects of the above program are readily carried out for single - particle properties .",
    "however a full calculation of the irreducible two - particle vertex  even within the dca  is prohibitively expensive  @xcite and , thus , has never been carried out .    in the present work",
    ", we would like to overcome this situation by suggesting a scheme where the @xmath26 and @xmath27 dependencies of the irreducible vertex are neglected . at low temperatures ,",
    "this amounts to the assumption that in a energy and momentum window around the fermi surface , the irreducible vertex depends weakly on @xmath26 and @xmath28 . following this assumption ,",
    "an effective two - particle vertex in terms of an average over the @xmath26 and @xmath28 dependencies of @xmath29 is introduced : @xmath30 as shown in an earlier quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) study by bulut et al .",
