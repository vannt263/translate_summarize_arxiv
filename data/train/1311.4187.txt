    "lasing and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) are two phenomena which make photonic and matter waves macroscopically coherent when they are confined in the cavity and trapped respectively , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "although the final state of the ensemble of particles is spontaneously broken , and can be described by well - defined amplitude and phase , the physical reasons for achieving this state are completely different for lasers and for objects exhibiting bec , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nowadays lasing is recognized as a very general and universal phenomenon that can be obtained under the matter - light field interaction in the cavity containing different media , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "lasers are non - equilibrium systems in the sense of thermodynamics and , in the common case , require pumping in order to form a population inversion , which elucidates non - equilibrium features of the lasing process . in many cases ,",

    "field in the cavity in the context of a semiclassical treatment , because probabilities of pump - induced upward and downward transitions between these two levels are equal .",
    "however , as it is shown in @xcite and recently discussed in @xcite , a full quantum theory of atom - light interaction predicts the presence of such inversion at the steady state .    the physical picture becomes richer in case when coherent light field formation takes place due to the equilibrium ( or quasi - equilibrium ) phase transition occurring in a coupled matter - light system .",
    "in fact , population inversion does not play any role in this case because it does not correspond to equilibrium properties of the system and it is not relevant for such transitions .",
    "actually , that is why a two - level system is suitable for realizing a thermodynamically equilibrium phase transition under the matter - light interaction , cf .",
    "noticing that dissipation and decoherence effects must be maximally suppressed in this case . if such effects are not so weak a coupled matter - field system undergoes non - equilibrium transition to lasing ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "however , this transition behaves quite differently as compared to conventional lasers because it occurs in the inversionless two - level system coupled to quantized field irradiation and strongly depends on the specific features of the medium , cf",
    ". @xcite .",
    "nowadays it has been shown that different condensed matter , solid state and even photonic systems exhibit bec phenomenon firstly obtained with ultra - cold atoms , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "although not all of them are completely thermodynamically equilibrium , in practice , the requirement of thermalization plays the essential role in achieving bec state , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , bec phenomenon has been observed for low dispersion branch exciton - polaritons in high - finesse semiconductor microcavities , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "since polaritons are mixed light - matter states , such experiments allow to resume the old discussion about physical similarities between lasing and phase transition at a qualitatively new level , cf .",
    "moreover , the terms `` polariton laser '' @xcite or `` atom laser '' @xcite which appeared in the last decades for emphasizing experimentally feasible high coherent properties of matter waves attach practical value to the discussion .",
    "actually , two thresholds are clearly seen in the experiments with exciton - polaritons confined in the cavity .",
    "the first one occurs at low pumping intensities and characterizes inversionless systems with excitons strongly coupled with a cavity mode @xcite .",

    "dressed states ( dss ) are at the heart of describing the interaction of high density atomic gases with nonresonant radiation in the presence of collisions with buffer gas particles , so - called optical collisions ( ocs ) @xcite .",
    "previously we suggested a model of atomic ds thermalization being obtained due to oc processes that accounts for the evolution of pseudo - spin bloch vector components and characterizes the essential ( negative ) role of a spontaneous emission in the thermalization process @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that in the presence of both photon and polariton trapping in biconical waveguide cavity with the appropriate lifetime of polaritons a high temperature bec for low branch ( lb ) photon - like polaritons is achieved @xcite .",
    "some time ago non - equilibrium phenomena in ds picture were intensively discussed in the framework of lasing phenomena in inversionless medium ; these phenomena taking place for lasers which operate on a transition between ds levels , or simply for ds lasers  see @xcite .",
    "the systems considered for these purposes imply the usage of spontaneous processes playing the role of pumping .",
    "however , oc processes which we deal with in the paper can represent a much more effective mechanism for population redistribution of dss .",
    "in particular , oc - induced transitions between ds are not identical for upward and backward directions .",

    "we have considered the problem of both thermodynamically equilibrium and non - equilibrium phase transitions with coupled atom - light states , i.e. dressed states .",

    "in particular , thermodynamically equilibrium phase transition to some superradiant ( coherent ) phase becomes possible for the cavity field in an inversionless atomic system at the negative detuning of a pump field from atomic transition due to the establishment of a strong coupling regime and thermalization of atomic ds population simultaneously .",
    "physically such a transition occurring in the cavity at high enough ( 500 k and above ) temperatures can be explained in the terms of the phase transition of photon - like ds polaritons to some condensed ( and/or superfluid ) state in the cavity with a special geometry , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the suppression of ds thermalization process due to spontaneous emission leads to the formation of thermodynamically quasi - equilibrium or completely non - equilibrium coupled atom - light states . in this case",
    "the atomic system in the cavity exhibits non - equilibrium phase transition to lasing in ds basis under the ds population inversion only . noticing that the vanishing threshold for ds population imbalance @xmath248 can be achieved under the fulfillment of the inequality that represents some modification of a strong coupling condition .",
    "the order parameter that is nothing else but the average number of photons in the cavity field in this limit depends on the ratio of atomic spontaneous emission rate to the cavity decay rate .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the lasing phenomenon characterized by ds population imbalance occurs at @xmath173 in the presence of ds thermalization too , that , perhaps , contradicts the imperative of lasers as entirely non - equilibrium devices .",
    "hopefully , the theory developed in the paper can be also useful for describing some other systems where ds picture is of great importance .",
