    "a generic single - field potential can be characterized by two independent mass scales : a `` height '' @xmath79 , corresponding to the vacuum energy density during inflation , and a `` width '' @xmath80 , corresponding to the change in the field value @xmath81 during inflation : @xmath82 different models have different forms for the function @xmath83 .",

    "the generalization to higher order in slow roll will be discussed in the following .",
    "large - field models have inflaton potentials typical of `` chaotic '' inflation scenarios @xcite , in which the scalar field is displaced from the minimum of the potential by an amount usually of order the planck mass .",

    ". furthermore these errors increase with the potential of the polynomial @xmath96 .",
    "of course , these statements are based on relations valid only at first order in the slow roll parameters .",
    "this means that for very large values of @xmath97 and @xmath1 higher order corrections become relevant and may significantly alter the simple relations ( [ large ] ) .",
    "small - field models are the type of potentials that arise naturally from spontaneous symmetry breaking ( such as the original models of `` new '' inflation @xcite ) and from pseudo nambu - goldstone modes ( natural inflation @xcite ) .",
    "the field starts from near an unstable equilibrium ( taken to be at the origin ) and rolls down the potential to a stable minimum .",

    "the hybrid scenario @xcite frequently appears in models which incorporate inflation into supersymmetry . in a typical hybrid inflation model , the scalar field responsible for inflation evolves toward a minimum with nonzero vacuum energy .",
    "the end of inflation arises as a result of instability in a second field .",

    "we consider generic potentials for hybrid inflation of the form @xmath112.$ ] the field value at the end of inflation is determined by some other physics , so there is a second free parameter characterizing the models . because of this extra freedom ,",
    "hybrid models fill a broad region in the @xmath85 plane . for @xmath113 ( where @xmath75 is the value of the inflaton field when there are _",
    "e_-foldings till the end of inflation ) one recovers the same results of the large field models . on the contrary , when @xmath114 , the dynamics are analogous to small - field models , except that the field is evolving toward , rather than away from , a dynamical fixed point .",
    "this distinction is important to the discussion here because near the fixed point the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 become independent of the number of _",
    "e_-folds @xmath12 , and the corresponding theoretical uncertainties due to the uncertainty in @xmath12 vanish .",
    "however , there is an additional degree of freedom not present in other models due to the presence of the additional parameter @xmath115 .",
    "therefore the theoretical uncertainties in the predictions of a generic hybrid inflation model are decoupled from the physics of reheating , and we do not consider such models further here . the distinguishing observational feature of many hybrid models is @xmath116 and a _ blue _ scalar spectral index , @xmath117 .",
    "notice that at first order in the slow roll parameters , there is no overlap in the @xmath85 plane between hybrid inflation and other models .",
    "however , as we will explicitly show , this feature is lost going beyond first order : by changing @xmath12 models can flow from the hybrid regions to other model regions ; this feature is generic , models can flow from one region to another .",
    "therefore it is important to distinguish between models labeled `` hybrid '' in the sense of evolution toward a late - time asymptote and the _ region _ labeled `` hybrid '' in the zoo plot .",
    "the lowest - order correspondence does not always survive to higher order in slow roll .",
    "linear models , @xmath119 , live on the boundary between large - field and small - field models , with @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the spectral index and tensor / scalar ratio are related as : @xmath122 for linear models , eq .",
    "( [ large ] ) applies .",
    "this enumeration of models is certainly not exhaustive .",
    "there are a number of single - field models that do not fit well into this scheme , for example logarithmic potentials @xmath123 $ ] typical of supersymmetry @xcite , where @xmath124 counts the degrees of freedom coupled to the inflaton field and @xmath125 is a coupling constant . for this kind of potentials ,",
    "one gets @xmath126 and @xmath127 corresponding to    @xmath128    because of the loop - factor suppression , one typically expects tiny theoretical errors in @xmath1 , but sizeable uncertainties in @xmath129 .",
    "another example is potentials with negative powers of the scalar field @xmath130 $ ] used in intermediate inflation @xcite and dynamical supersymmetric inflation @xcite .",
    "both of these cases require an auxiliary field to end inflation and are more properly categorized as hybrid models , but fall into the small - field region of the @xmath85 plane .",
