    "the next - generation dna sequencing technology is changing biological research in many aspects and opening up new directions of experimental designs .",
    "the underlining technology of many of the current available platforms and those that are still under development can be categorized as sequencing by synthesis ( sbs ) . in sbs , nucleotides are added to the reactions repeatedly in a pre - determined cyclic manner .",
    "those nucleotides that are complementary to the template sequence will be potentially incorporated at each step , usually driven by enzymes .",
    "the presence or absence of any signal at each step reveals the nature of the template being sequenced .    in some of these sbs technologies , such as the illumina genome analyzer",
    ", a mixture of four nucleotides is added at each cycle and the identity of the nucleotide is distinguished by the four different fluorescent labels .",
    "the nucleotides are modified so that only one base can be incorporated in each cycle . in this case , the length of sequencing reads has a simple relation with the number of sequencing cycles : they are equal to each other . in some other sbs technologies , such as pyrosequencing , however , only one kind of nucleotides is added to the reaction in each cycle .",
    "the length of sequencing reads will not have a fixed relation with the number of sequencing cycles .",
    "rather , the read length is dependent on the sequence context and the nucleotide flow order .",
    "for the traditional pyrosequencing , the nucleotide incorporation is optimized to be as complete as possible in each cycle to avoid errors caused by dephasing ( discussed below ) . at each extension cycle ,",
    "ideally the nucleotide should be incorporated @xmath0 if it is complementary to the target sequence ( including the homopolymer regions ) .",
    "analytical statistical distributions have been derived for this situation in a previous paper @xcite . in the present paper we deal with statistical distributions for the case where the nucleotide incorporation is not achieved @xmath0 at each cycle . for the emerging single - molecule dna sequencing technology @xcite ,",
    "sometimes it is desirable to _ not _ achieve @xmath0 nucleotide incorporation at each cycle in order to maximize the resolution of homopolymer regions and increase the accuracy of nucleotide incorporation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive statistical distributions for sbs with probabilistic , or incomplete , nucleotide incorporation .",
    "mathematically these results are generalizations of the results obtained previously for @xmath0 nucleotide incorporation at each cycle @xcite .",
    "these distributions are useful in different stages in the use and development of the next - generation dna sequencing technology , such as instrument development and testing , algorithm and software development , and the everyday machine performance monitoring and trouble - shooting .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in the remaining of this _ introduction _ section we give a brief description of the single - molecule dna sequencing technology ( sms ) , for which the theoretical results of present work will find most useful .",
    "we also define the necessary notation here .",
    "the derivation of the main results , which are exact under the assumptions of the sequence model , will be presented in the _ bivariate generating functions _ section .",
    "after that , we present the explicit formulas for the mean and variance of the distributions , for both fixed number of cycles and fixed sequences length . after that , we generalize the results to the situation where nucleotide incorporation depends on sequence context .",
    "the main results are summarized in eqs .  , , , ) , and .",
    "single - molecule dna sequencing ( sms ) technology becomes commercially available only in 2008 @xcite , but major efforts are underway to develop different kinds of sms technologies and it is expected that more sms platforms will be available in the next few years @xcite . some of these sms technologies employ sbs as the underlining principle .",
    "one of the advantages of sms compared with bulk sequencing technologies is that , unlike other bulk sequencing platforms , sms does not have a clonal amplification step for the target sequences . instead",
    ", a single target sequence molecule is used as the template .",
    "this avoids the problems of bias and errors introduced by pcr in the amplification step .",
    "another advantage of sms is that the problem of dephasing associated with bulk sequencing can be circumvented .    in the bulk sequencing ,",
    "a significant copy numbers of the target sequence have to be present to obtain a detectable signal . during the sequencing process",
    ", the synchronization between identical individual templates will be lost gradually , leading to signal decay and sequencing errors .",
    "to avoid dephasing , the reaction reagents and synthesis chemistry are usually tuned to drive the enzymatic incorporation to completion at each cycle . as a consequence , the misincorporation rate will increase .",
    "for sms , since each molecule is monitored individually , the dephasing problem does not exist .",
    "the reaction kinetics can be controlled to adjust the rate of incorporation to the benefit of sequencing accuracy .",
    "for example , slow reaction kinetics can be used to limit incorporation to two or three bases @xcite .",
    "for a homopolymer region ` ggg ` , the bulk sequencing will try to incorporate three ` c ` s in one cycle ; for sms , however , zero , one , two , or three ` c ` s can be incorporated in a single synthesis cycle .",
    "this flexibility in incorporation rate can be utilized to increase the resolution of homopolymer region @xcite .    as a result , for sms the consecutive zeros in the signal ( where there is no incorporation ) is not limited to @xmath1 as in the pyrosequencing case . instead , if the nucleotide complementary to the template is not incorporated in the current cycle , it still has chance to be incorporated in the next cycle , or the next - next cycle , without detrimental effect on sequencing quality .",
    "the relation between the read length and flow cycle in sms will also be different from that of traditional pyrosequencing . in the following",
    "we will derive an analytical expression for the distribution , which will depend on nucleotide composition of the target sequences as well as the incorporation probability of each nucleotide .      to avoid the unnecessary specification of the detailed names of the four kinds of nucleotides , in the following",
    "we will use @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 to represent any permutations of the usual nucleotides @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , as we did previously @xcite . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that the nucleotides in the target sequence are independent of each other .",
    "note that this is different from the sequence - context dependence of _ nucleotide incorporation _",
    ", which will be addressed in section  [ s : dependent ] .",
    "the probabilities for the four nucleotides in the target sequence are denoted as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the nucleotide incorporation probabilities are denoted as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 stands for the kind of nucleotides , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 denotes the cycle number , with the current cycle as @xmath20 . for example , when it is complementary to the template , if the chance for nucleotide @xmath3 to be incorporated in the current cycle , the next cycle , and the next - next cycle is @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively , then @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "obviously , the pyrosequencing discussed previously is a special case in this notation with @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 . by definition @xmath32 .",

    "the @xmath14 will be generalized to be sequence - context dependent in section  [ s : dependent ] .",
    "we also use the same definition of nucleotide _ flow cycle number _ as before ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) , which is defined as the `` quad cycle '' of successive four nucleotides \\{@xmath37}. the cycle number is denoted as @xmath38 in the following .",

    "<S> some of the technologies , especially those exploring the principle of single - molecule sequencing , allow incomplete nucleotide incorporation in each cycle . </S>",
    "<S> we derive statistical distributions for sequencing by synthesis by taking into account the possibility that nucleotide incorporation may not be complete in each flow cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical distributions are expressed in terms of nucleotide probabilities of the target sequences and the nucleotide incorporation probabilities for each nucleotide . </S>",
    "<S> we give exact distributions both for fixed number of flow cycles and for fixed sequence length . </S>",
    "<S> explicit formulas are derived for the mean and variance of these distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the results are generalizations of our previous work for pyrosequencing . </S>",
    "<S> incomplete nucleotide incorporation leads to significant change in the mean and variance of the distributions , but still they can be approximated by normal distributions with the same mean and variance . </S>",
    "<S> the results are also generalized to handle sequence context dependent incorporation . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical distributions will be useful for instrument and software development for sequencing by synthesis platforms . </S>"
