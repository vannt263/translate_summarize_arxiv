    "their reported q - factors have increased considerably in recent years .",
    "for instance , eichler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the q - factors of gnmrs can reach values of @xmath0 .",

    "et al . _ also found that the q - factor of gnmr increases with decreasing temperature , and reaches @xmath1 at 5 k  @xcite .",
    "a general characteristic in the temperature dependence of the q - factor is the temperature scaling phenomenon , i.e the q - factor increases exponentially with two different exponents above or below a critical temperature ( @xmath2 ) . in other words",

    "the value of the transition temperature @xmath2 varies from different experiments , ranging from 50 to 100  k in the gnmr.@xcite however , a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon has not been presented .",
    "furthermore , in all previous theoretical studies , only a single exponent was obtained for the temperature dependence of the q - factor in gnmrs or nanotube resonators.@xcite therefore , the aim of the present work is to identify the underlying mechanism for this unresolved temperature scaling phenomenon on the q - factor of gnmrs .    in this paper",
    ", we identify the out - of - plane migration of adsorbate atoms as the cause of this unresolved temperature scaling phenomena on the q - factors of gnmrs via classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",

    "the q - factor undergoes a discontinuous , step - like decrease at the first critical temperature @xmath3 due to the introduction of strong thermal noise resulting from the in - plane migration .",
    "in contrast , a continuous transition in the q - factor is observed at the second critical temperature @xmath2 , which corresponds to the temperature scaling phenomenon observed in the experiments.@xcite we also study the effects of adsorbate percentage and mass on the temperature scaling phenomenon .",

    "if more than one adsorbate atom is considered , the interaction between adsorbates is ignored , and thus our simulation mimics a small adsorbate percentage .",

    "first , a nos - hoover@xcite thermostat is applied to thermalize the system to a constant temperature within the nvt ( i.e. the particles number n , the volume v and the temperature t of the system are constant ) ensemble , which is run for 50000 md steps .",
    "the mechanical oscillation of the resonator is then actuated by adding a velocity distribution to the system , which follows the morphology of the first flexural vibrational mode of graphene  @xcite . the imposed velocity distribution , or actuation energy , is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total kinetic energy in the gnmr after thermalization but just before its actuation and @xmath18 is the actuation energy parameter .",
    "we have chosen a small value of @xmath19 in all simulations here , so that the mechanical oscillation occurs within the linear regime .",

    "the adsorbate migrates on top of the gnmr , but remains connected to the gnmr through the van der waals interactions . a direct result of the in - plane migration is the excitation of many in - plane vibrational modes in the gnmr that result from the friction between the migrating adsorbate and the gnmr",

    "we note that the q - factor at @xmath24  k is so high ( i.e. that energy dissipation is quite weak , as has been observed experimentally@xcite ) that it is difficult for us to precisely extract its value from our md simulations . as a result",
    ", we assign the same q - factor of 30000 at these ultra - low temperatures , which is likely to be a lower bound estimate .",

    "this transition is exactly the temperature scaling of the q - factor corresponds to that which has been observed experimentally , where the corresponding scaling factors are @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the experiment.@xcite there are several possible effects that may be responsible for this difference in the scaling exponents between our md simulations and the experiments , as will be shown in the following .",
    "we observe from visualizing the simulation results that the critical temperature @xmath2 is exactly the temperature at which the adsorbate begins to migrate out of the plane , i.e. in the @xmath26-direction . during this migration ,",
    "the adsorbate develops sufficient kinetic energy such that it breaks the van der waals bond connecting it to the gnmr , and travels away from the gnmr surface . due to the finite size of the simulation box , the migrating adsorbate eventually reaches and reflects from the boundary of the simulation box , which results in it hitting the gnmr frequently from arbitrary directions .",
    "these arbitrary collisions cause the excitation of various vibrational modes , including both in - plane and out - of - plane modes .",
    "if the incident angle of the adsorbate is orthogonal to the vibrational motion of the gnmr , then the out - of - plane modes will predominately be excited , which strongly impacts the out - of - plane mechanical vibrations of the gnmr . as a result ,",

    "specifically , the energetic barrier is substantially smaller for the @xmath27 in - plane migration than the @xmath26-direction out - of - plane migration .",
    "this is because the adsorbate will be attracted by neighboring carbon atoms during its migration process from one minimum potential energy position to a neighboring minimum potential energy position . as a result , the energy exchange between the adsorbate and the gnmr is larger for the @xmath26 migration than the @xmath27 migration . in other words ,",

    "thus , in this temperature range , [ 47.5 , 200.0 ]  k , the adsorbate loses a substantial amount of its velocity whenever it attempts to escape , which accounts for the disturbance in the mmd seen at @xmath2 .",
    "a specific example of this , i.e. an unsuccessful escape attempt at 50  k , is shown in figure .  [ fig_noescape_movie_50k ] .",
    "from top to bottom , the adsorbate attempts , but eventually fails to escape and thus is pulled back towards the gnmr surface as the kinetic energy it gains from the mechanical oscillation of the gnmr is not large enough to break its van der waals with the gnmr .",

    "the collision frequency is calculated by the total collision counts divided by the total md simulation time . in the high temperature range ,",
    "the collision frequency increases linearly with increasing temperature , because both the free migrating velocity of the adsorbate and the oscillation velocity of the gnmr are proportional to @xmath45 .",

    "this significant change ( @xmath54 difference in @xmath37 ) displays that the number of adsorbates has a substantial effect on the temperature scaling , where in particular the transition at @xmath2 becomes sharper in gnmrs with more adsorbates .",
    "we note that this effect should be experimentally verifiable .",
    "panel ( c ) shows that the strength of the van der waals interaction between the adsorbate and the gnmr has an important effect on the value of the two critical temperatures @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , those critical temperatures are reduced by nearly 50% if the interaction parameter @xmath15 between adsorbate and the gnmr is reduced by 50% , while @xmath18 and @xmath37 are not obviously affected .",
    "finally , panel ( d ) shows that the mass of the adsorbate also plays an important role for the temperature scaling . for lighter adsorbates ,",
    "the temperature scaling is smoother at @xmath2 . both transition temperatures @xmath3 and @xmath2 become much higher for the lighter adsorbate , since those atoms have a smaller kinetic energy at the same temperature as larger mass adsorbates , and therefore more thermal energy is needed to induce migration for the smaller mass atoms .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) may serve as useful guidelines for experimentalists to verify our theoretical predictions , as different types of adsorbates ( of different mass or / and different interaction strengths with gnmrs ) are usually observed experimentally .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed classical md simulations to study how adsorbate migration affects the q - factors of gnmrs .",
    "our key finding is that there are two critical temperatures , which correspond to the initiation of in - plane and out - of - plane migration of the adsorbate .",
    "the out - of - plane adsorbate migration is found to be the origin for the temperature scaling in the q - factor observed experimentally@xcite , because the resonant oscillation of the gnmr is strongly interrupted by collisions from the migrating adsorbate .",
    "we predict a discontinuous decrease of the q - factor at the lower critical temperature due to the initiation of in - plane migration of the adsorbate .",
    "we also studied , in the hopes of providing useful guidelines to experimentalists to verify these theoretical predictions , how different numbers of adsorbate atoms , sizes of the gnmr , or strength of van der waals interactions between the adsorbate and the gnmr impact the temperature scaling of the q - factor .",
