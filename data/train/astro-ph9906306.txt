    "[ fig.2 ] the fit is quite satisfactory .",

    "the first line has nearly the same wavelength as the weak component of the  doublet and therefore makes the determination of /  very tricky for solar - type metallicities , whereas the unidentified line at 6708.28  is further away and only affects the determination of the lithium isotope ratio marginally .    assuming that the two unidentified lines are neutral metal lines they will have equivalent widths less than 0.15 and 0.3m , respectively , in solar - type stars with @xmath6}}\\la -0.6 $ ] .",

    "the cn lines seen in fig .  [ fig.2 ] play no rle in the spectra of the program stars mainly because both c and n scales almost linearly with fe and partly because the stars have somewhat higher effective temperatures than the sun .",

    "the synthetic spectrum was first folded with a gaussian function representing the instrumental profile and then with either a gaussian , a radial - tangential or a rotational profile .",
    "various combinations of these profiles was also tried , but in no cases the fit to the iron lines was better than that obtained with a gaussian function .",
    "the final analysis was therefore carried out with a single gaussian representing the combined effect of instrumental and stellar atmospheric broadening .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussian broadening profile , @xmath47 , has been determined with the following procedure .",

    "is predicted in contrast to the 0.3 dex expected by pinsonneault et al .",

    "see , for example , the state of the art calculations by pinsonneault et al . in summary , depletion of @xmath100li is to be expected but , at present , the magnitude of this depletion is uncertain with even standard calculations unavailable for the mass and metallicity of our old disk stars .    encouraged by recent observations of @xmath100li , be , and b several predictions about the galactic chemical evolution of li , be , and b have appeared . behind such predictions are assumptions about the nucleosynthetic processes of li , be , and b manufacture that demand assumptions about the early galaxy , especially about the cosmic rays that permeated the halo and then the disk . qualitatively ,",
    "the key nucleosynthetic processes are known : ( i ) the big bang provided only the @xmath103li ( in addition to h , @xmath108h , @xmath109he , and @xmath110he ) that is widely considered to account for the observed li abundance of the warm halo stars , the so - called spite plateau ; ( ii ) interactions between standard gcr and ism and/or interactions between fast c , n , o nuclei from superbubbles with h or he in the ism provide li , be , and b by spallation processes ( e.g. , o + p @xmath111 be ) and li through the fusion process @xmath112li and @xmath103li ; ( iii ) neutrino - induced spallation processes in type ii supernovae that may provide @xmath103li and @xmath113b .",
    "a key facet of this suite of processes is that beryllium with @xmath114be as the single stable isotope is produced solely by spallation of c , n , o in flight or at rest .",
    "hence , observed beryllium abundances may be used to calibrate the yields of cosmic ray spallation .",
    "this is especially useful now that there are extensive measurements of the be abundance in disk and halo dwarf stars .",
    "the relative yields of light nuclides , for example @xmath100li to @xmath114be , are essentially independent of the cosmic ray spectrum unless there is a large excess of low energy cosmic rays ( @xmath115 mev nucleon@xmath27 ) with respect to higher energy particles .",
    "this happy circumstance arises because above the similar threshold energies for the different processes ( e.g. , @xmath114be from @xmath116 + o and @xmath117b also from @xmath116 + o ) , the spallation cross - sections are almost energy independent . that ratios of yields are independent of the form of the ( high ) energy spectrum was well illustrated by ramaty et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . at energies around the threshold energies for the various processes , the relative yields are energy and composition dependent .",
    "moreover , li production occurs also through @xmath5 fusion reactions that do not synthesize be and b.    the b / be ratio of halo stars is consistent within measurement uncertainty with production by spallation : duncan et al .",

    "low energy spallation or a contribution from type ii supernovae are needed to resolve this discrepancy .",

    "our old disk stars with detectable @xmath100li have li abundances slightly in excess of the spite plateau .",
    "if , as standard models of pre - main sequence and main sequence evolution predict , the depletion of @xmath103li has been extremely slight , we may use the observed abundance and the prediction that cosmic ray production of the li isotopes gives an isotopic ratio @xmath103li/@xmath100li @xmath121 to estimate the contribution of @xmath100li from cosmic rays .",

    "if cosmic rays were entirely responsible for this increase , a division @xmath103li @xmath104 36 and @xmath100li @xmath104 24 is appropriate for a production ratio @xmath103li/@xmath100li @xmath124 .",

    "( @xcite ) have argued on the basis of lithium abundances of spite plateau stars in the range @xmath125 [ fe / h ] @xmath126 that the plateau has a metallicity dependence due to the manufacture of the li isotopes by cosmic rays .",
    "they consider the primordial abundance to be log@xmath44(li ) @xmath104 2.00 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath127 .",
    "if smith et al.s -scale is adopted , this abundance is raised to be about 2.12 according to 4 stars common to both analyses .",
    "this and ryan et al.s metallicity dependence predict hd68284 to have a li abundance of 2.44 which is similar to the observed value of 2.35 .",
    "relative to a plateau of 2.12 , the observed abundance implies cosmic rays have added li in the proportion @xmath103li = 54 and @xmath100li = 36 which are consistent with our observations provided that @xmath100li has been depleted by about 0.6 dex . at some point in the evolution of the galaxy ,",
    "sources ( presumably stellar ) contributed @xmath103li with little or no @xmath100li in order to raise the @xmath103li/@xmath100li ratio to the solar ratio of 12.5 .",
    "inclusion of such a contribution in the above argument reduces the @xmath100li inferred from the increase in li abundance over the plateau s value .",
    "the preceding argument may be inverted : the predicted growth of @xmath100li with [ fe / h ] may be used to infer the  abundance .",
    "for example , the models proposed by fields & olive , and vangioni - flam et al .",

    "added to the primordial  abundance of 160 this implies a total  abundance of 340 ( log@xmath128[7]{li } } ) = 2.53 $ ] ) , a value considerably greater than the observed value of about 200 .",
    "the obvious implications are that either the predicted @xmath100li abundance is greatly overestimated or @xmath103li has been depleted by about 0.2 dex . in sharp contrast , yoshii et al.s prediction is a @xmath100li abundance of about 30 providing a total  abundance of 205 or log@xmath44(li ) = 2.31 , in excellent agreement with the observed  abundances of and .",
    "this model fails , however , to account for the meteoritic @xmath100li abundance by a large amount .",
    "it is presently impossible to refine our conclusions because understanding of li - depletion , especially of @xmath100li - depletion , is poor .",
    "this is unfortunate as there is a tantalizing hint from the few detections of @xmath100li with the support of the greater suite of upper limits to the @xmath100li abundance that the growth of the @xmath100li abundance in the galaxy up to the metallicity of the old disk ( [ fe / h ] @xmath129 ) may have been very slight , a result in conflict with the most recent models of @xmath100li chemical evolution but in agreement with a model proposed by yoshii et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this tentative suggestion is dependent on the absence of severe @xmath100li - depletion in our disk stars .",

    "more common instrumentation will be adequate for expanding the sample of more metal - rich halo and disk stars with a known @xmath100li abundance and , in this case , a very large sample of stars may be needed to map out the upper envelope to the @xmath100li vs [ fe / h ] relation which with the corresponding @xmath103li vs [ fe / h ] envelope may suffice to determine empirically the evolution of the @xmath103li/@xmath100li ratio",
