    "quantum simulators , as first proposed by feynman @xcite , which are devices built to evolve according to a postulated quantum hamiltonian and thus `` compute '' its properties , are one of the hot ideas which may provide a breakthrough in many - body physics . while one must be aware of possible difficulties ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , impressive progress has been achieved in recent years in different systems employing cold atoms and molecules , nuclear magnetic resonance , superconducting qubits , and ions .",
    "the latter are extremely well controlled and already it has been demonstrated that , indeed , quantum spin systems may be simulated with cold - ion setups @xcite .",
    "quantum spin systems on a lattice constitute some of the most relevant cases for quantum simulations as there are many instances where standard numerical techniques to compute their dynamics or even their static behavior fail , especially for two- or three - dimensional systems .",
    "chronologically the first proposition to use trapped ions to simulate lattice spin models came from porras and cirac @xcite who derived the effective spin - hamiltonian for the system , @xmath1-\\mu\\sum\\limits_{i } s_{i}^{z } ,    \\label{hamspin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the chemical potential ( which in this case acts as an external magnetic field ) , @xmath3 is the interaction strength , and @xmath4 are the spin operators at site @xmath5 .",
    "all the long - ranged interactions fall off with a @xmath6 dipolar decay , which for the ions is due to the fact that they are both induced by the same mechanism , namely lattice vibrations mediated by the coulomb force @xcite .",
    "hamiltonian is a dipolar xxz model where the ratio of hopping to dipolar repulsion can be scaled by @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "another route to simulate quantum magnetism of dipolar systems , using the rotational structure of the ultracold polar molecules , has been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this case , the xy ( or tunneling ) term is restricted to nearest neighbors ( nn ) and only the zz ( or interaction ) term is dipolar .",
    "precisely this long - range ( lr ) dipolar character makes this system interesting and challenging .",
    "dipolar interactions introduce new physics to conventional short - range ( sr ) systems .",
    "for example , for soft - core bosons , the system with long - range interactions and short - range tunneling , can  apart from mott - insulating ( mi ) , superfluid ( sf ) , and crystal phases  host a haldane - insulating phase @xcite .",
    "this is characterized by antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order between empty sites and sites with double occupancy , with an arbitrarily long string of sites with unit occupancy in between .",
    "another case where dipolar interactions play a crucial role is the appearance of the celebrated supersolid .",
    "the extended bose - hubbard model ( i.e. , with nn interactions ) with soft - core on - site interactions shows stable supersolidity in one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite and square lattices @xcite , where in the 1d case a continuous transition to the supersolid phase occurs , in contrast to the first - order phase transition in two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices .",
    "long - ranged dipolar interactions on the other hand allow for the appearance of supersolidity even in the hard - core limit @xcite . in this limit ,",
    "dipolar interactions give rise to a large number of metastable states @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) . by tuning the direction of the dipoles , incompressible regions like devil s staircase structures",
    "have been predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite . while being interesting , long - range interactions make computer simulations of such systems quite difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "since ions in optical lattices may be extremely well controlled , they form an ideal medium for a quantum simulator .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we considered both the mean - field phase diagram for the system ( [ hamspin ] ) as well as a 1d chain using different quasi - exact techniques , such as density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , and exact diagonalization for small systems .",
    "here , we would like to concentrate on frustration effects on a 2d triangular lattice using a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) approach .",
    "for the system consisting of spin - half particles ( as , e.g. , originating from two internal ion states in the porras ",
    "cirac @xcite proposal ) the spins can be mapped onto a system of hard - core bosons , using the holstein ",
    "primakoff transformation , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 @xmath12 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of hard - core bosons and @xmath13 is the number operator at site @xmath5 .",
    "these bosons obey the normal bosonic commutation relationships , @xmath14=1 $ ] , but are constrained to only single filling , @xmath15 .",
    "this is the limit when the on - site repulsion term @xmath16 goes to infinity in the standard bose - hubbard model . in this representation , a spin up particle",
    "is represented by a filled site and a spin down particle by an empty site . for convenience , we will mostly use the language of hard - core bosons in this paper .    before presenting the results for the 2d triangular lattice ,",
    "let us briefly review the behavior of the system for a 1d chain of bosons as obtained in ref .",
    "in order to form some intuition about possible physical effects due to the lr interaction and tunneling , we now discuss briefly the ground - state phase diagram of the hamiltonian in 1d . for hard - core bosons , which is the topic of this article ,",
    "the one - dimensional version of the hamiltonian has been thoroughly investigated in the past @xcite ( see also @xcite for the special cases @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . for reference ,",
    "we reproduce in fig .  [ fig : phasediagram1d ] the phase diagrams for the system with dipolar interaction and nn tunneling , as well as the system with both the interaction and the tunneling terms dipolar .     phase diagram of the 1d system with dipolar interactions and * ( a ) * nearest - neighbor tunneling , * ( b ) * dipolar tunneling . the phases are labeled according to density matrix renormalization results , while the actual data shown comes from the infinite time evolving block decimation method ( with interactions truncated at next - to - nearest - neighbors ) , both from ref .  @xcite . along the black line",
    ", there exists a devil s staircase of crystal states . at finite tunneling , for ( a )",
    ", these spread into conventional insulating states , while for ( b ) , they form quasi - supersolids . the light blue lines near the center of the plots",
    "sketch the crystal lobes at @xmath19-filling .",
    "their cusp - like structure is typical for 1d systems . in 2d , they are expected to be rounded off , similar to mott - lobes of the bose  hubbard model @xcite . for nearest - neighbor tunneling , ( a ) , the superfluid ( sf ) phases can be mapped into one another , while for nearest - neighbor dipolar tunneling , ( b ) , they are distinct on the ferromagnetic ( fm , @xmath20 ) and the antiferromagnetic side ( afm , @xmath21 ) . note also that in ( b ) frustration leads to an asymmetry between @xmath20 and @xmath21 . ]    at zero tunneling , the ground states are periodic crystals where  to minimize the dipolar interaction energy  occupied sites are as far apart as possible for a given filling factor @xcite . for finite 1d systems and very small",
    "tunneling such a situation persists as exemplified in @xcite . for infinite chains in 1d , every fractional filling factor @xmath22 is a stable ground state for a portion of @xmath2 parameter space .",
    "the extent in @xmath2 decreases with @xmath23 , since at large distances the dipolar repulsion is weak and thus can not efficiently stabilize crystals with a large period .",
    "this succession of crystal states is termed the devil s staircase .",
    "this name derives from its surprising mathematical properties , challenging naive intuitions about continuity and measure : since all rational fillings are present , it is a continuous function ; moreover , its derivative vanishes almost everywhere ( i.e. , it is non - zero only on a set of measure zero )  and still it is not a constant , but covers a finite range .    at finite tunneling , the crystals spread into lobes similar to the mott lobes of the bose",
    " hubbard model .",
    "if the tunneling is only over nns , these mott lobes are not sensitive to the sign of the tunneling and they form standard insulating states with diagonal long - range order ( lro ) and off - diagonal short - range order ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram1d]a ) . for long - range dipolar tunneling ,",
    "the extent of the lobes is asymmetric under sign change @xmath24 : frustration effects stabilize the crystal states for @xmath20 , while the ferromagnetic ( fm ) tunneling for @xmath21 destabilizes them ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram1d]b ) .",
    "moreover , the crystal states acquire off - diagonal correlations which follow the algebraic decay of the dipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "this coexistence of diagonal and off - diagonal ( quasi-)lro turns the crystal states into ( quasi-)supersolids . the occurrence of such phases for hard - core bosons in 1d is truly exceptional , since the systems where it appears consist typically of soft - core bosons @xcite , or two - dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this 1d quasi - supersolid defies luttinger - liquid theory , which typically describes 1d systems very well , even in the presence of dipolar interactions @xcite . where luttinger - liquid theory applies , diagonal and off - diagonal correlations decay algebraically with exponents which are the inverse of one another .",
    "therefore , if the diagonal correlations show lro , the corresponding exponent is effectively @xmath25 , and the exponent for the off - diagonal correlations is infinite , describing an exponential decay . in our case , this exponent remains finite in the quasi - supersolid phase and the above relationship clearly does not hold .    at even stronger tunneling strengths , the crystal melts and",
    "the system is in a sf phase .",
    "the lr tunneling and interactions influence the correlation functions at large distances and therefore also modify the character of this phase @xcite .",
    "these results show that in this system the dipolar interactions considerably modify the quantum - mechanical phase diagram . in higher dimensions",
    ", we can expect the influence of long - range interactions to be even stronger , which makes extending these studies to a two - dimensional lattice highly relevant .",
    "for example , one can expect that  if quasi - supersolids appear already in 1d  the long - range tunneling has a profound effect on the stability of two - dimensional supersolids , which appear in triangular lattices at the transition between crystal and superfluid phases @xcite .",
    "also , the frustration effects already observed in the 1d system should be much more pronounced in the triangular lattice , simply due to the increased number of interactions , our method of choice , quantum monte carlo , fails due to the sign problem , invoked by frustration .",
    "see section  [ cha : results ] for details . ] .",
    "further , such an analysis is especially relevant at finite temperature .",
    "in fact , a recent work scanned the phase diagram of hamiltonian along the line @xmath26 in a square lattice @xcite .",
    "there , the authors found that above the superfluid on the fm side ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) , the continuous u(1 ) symmetry of the off - diagonal correlations remains broken even at finite temperatures .",
    "thus , the long - range nature of the tunneling leads to a phase which defies the mermin ",
    "wagner theorem @xcite .    for these reasons",
    ", we can expect intriguing effects of the long - range tunneling for the two dimensional triangular lattice , to which we turn now .",
    "to analyze the system of dipolar bosons on the two dimensional triangular lattice , we employ quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations at a finite but low temperature .",
    "specifically , we study rhombic lattices with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath27 sites , with @xmath28 .",
    "we will in particular thoroughly investigate the wigner crystal at @xmath19-filling .",
    "the triangular lattice is frustrated even with only nn interactions .",
    "when any longer ranged interactions are added , this only increases the frustration , which also makes qmc calculations more difficult . also , in frustrated systems @xcite and systems with long - range interactions @xcite typically many metastable states appear , making finding the ground state a somewhat difficult task . to avoid complications with the sign problem , caused by negative probabilities in qmc codes , we will take only negative values of @xmath7 under consideration .",
    "note that this sign problem appears only for the long - ranged xy interactions , while the zz ( ising - like ) interactions are  despite frustration ",
    "sign - problem free .    in this study",
    ", we compare the hamiltonian with both long - range interactions and hoppings ( lr  lr ) , with long - ranged dipolar interactions but nn hopping ( lr  sr ; relevant for polar molecules @xcite ) , as well as with hopping and interactions truncated at nns ( sr  sr ; this is the nn xxz model , relevant to magnetic materials with planar anisotropy in their couplings ) , this amounts to including interactions up to distances of the fifth - nearest neighbor . ] .",
    "each of these systems will display different crystal , superfluid , and supersolid regions .",
    "comparing these cases will give valuable insight into the influence of the long - range terms .",
    "all the calculations were performed using the worm algorithm of the open source alps ( algorithms and libraries for physics simulations ) project @xcite .",
    "this algorithm , first created by n. prokofev , works by sampling world lines in the path integral representation of the partition function in the grand canonical ensemble @xcite .      the first calculation , which creates the motivation for the rest of the paper , is to look at the case of vanishing tunneling and temperature for each system ( lr  lr , lr  sr , and sr ",
    "sr ) . here ,",
    "similar to the 1d devil s staircase , at vanishing temperature a series of insulating crystal states is expected to cover the entire range of @xmath29 .",
    "since we are interested in finite temperature results , we set @xmath30  which should still be low enough to reflect the characteristics of the ground - state phase diagram  and look for plateaus in the density .",
    "we distinguish short- and long - ranged zz interactions . from fig .",
    "[ devil ] , left panel , we can see that the only plateau ( besides the completely filled system ) that appears is at @xmath31 ( corresponding either to @xmath19 boson filling or in spin terms , a lattice with @xmath19 of the spins oriented up and @xmath32 oriented down ) for both short- and long - ranged interactions . scaling the system size from @xmath33 to @xmath34",
    "causes no change for the short - ranged interactions , and minimal change for the long - ranged ones .",
    "the key difference is in the size and position of the short - ranged and the long - ranged plateaus . for short - ranged interactions",
    "this plateau is larger and centered around @xmath35 , while the long - ranged interactions have a smaller plateau centered around @xmath36 .",
    "the finite width of these plateaus suggests that a @xmath19-filling wigner crystal persists also for some finite @xmath7 .",
    "the right panels of fig .  [ devil ] show how the plateau shrinks with increasing temperature , as well for sr interactions ( top right panel ) as for lr interactions ( bottom right panel ) . in the latter case ,",
    "in fact , by @xmath37 the plateau has completely disappeared .",
    "we can also notice that at @xmath38 there are signs of some of the other plateaus , most noticably the @xmath39-filling plateau .",
    "the rest of the paper will focus on the @xmath19-filling crystal lobes and their properties .     and @xmath30 , where the density shows a single plateau for @xmath19-filling .",
    "for sr interactions ( solid blue line ) , different curves for @xmath40coincide , and for lr interactions ( solid red : @xmath33 , dashed red : @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) the size dependence is small .",
    "the panels on the right are at fixed @xmath34 and @xmath17 for different temperatures @xmath43 ( from dotted to dashed to solid ) . both for sr ( top right ) and lr interactions ( bottom right ) , the @xmath19-filling plateau shrinks as t increases . , scaledwidth=100.0% ]      we now introduce a finite tunneling by choosing @xmath20 in our hamiltonian , and study the properties around the @xmath19-filling crystal .",
    "we calculate the density and the superfluid fraction .",
    "the superfluidity is measured using the winding numbers calculated from the movement of the worms in the qmc code . in order to get this value the system must have periodic boundary conditions so that the world lines can properly `` wind '' around the system .",
    "the superfluid fraction is    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the winding number fluctuation of the world lines and @xmath46 is the inverse temperature .",
    "figure [ lobes ] shows the results for the boson density of a @xmath33 triangular lattice at @xmath30 .",
    "for all types of interactions we see that as @xmath7 increases in absolute value the @xmath47 plateau shrinks , because larger @xmath48 increases the ratio of hopping to dipolar interactions .",
    "this introduces more kinetic energy and the crystal melts into a superfluid .",
    "it can be seen for the sr  sr system that the boson density lobe extends to @xmath49 , while for the lr  sr interactions it ends at @xmath50 , and finally for lr  lr interactions the lobe is smaller still , only going out to @xmath51 .",

    "while the short - ranged lobe exists approximately for @xmath52 , the long - ranged lobes lie generally on the interval @xmath53 . for a system like this at @xmath54 ,",
    "one expects the @xmath47 lobe to exist on the range @xmath55 with a mirrored image of the @xmath56 lobe at @xmath57 .",
    "the existence of the two identical lobes is explained by particle - hole symmetry @xcite .",
    "the lobes are separated with a kind of mixed solid in between ( with coexistence of @xmath32- and @xmath19-filling regions ) the existence of this region may be caused by several phenomena .",
    "it could either be an effect of the finite temperature as in ref .",
    "@xcite , or due to the existence of many metastable states caused by a devil s staircase like behavior , similar to what was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "again referring to the @xmath54 phase diagram , we expect that there is a region of supersolidity that extends in between the lobes and goes all the way to their base at @xmath58 @xcite . in our system",

    "[ lobes ] , it is obvious indeed that , if a supersolid region exists , it can only be near the tip of the lobe because the superfluidity is zero a significant way up the lobe . judging by the increased separation of the long - ranged lobes , we can assume that the supersolid region for these systems should increase in size to fill the region in between . to search for the supersolid phase",
    ", we now compare the superfluidity with the static structure factor .",
    "the structure factor is defined as the fourier transform of the density - density correlations ,    @xmath59    here , we focus on the wave vector @xmath60 , which corresponds to the @xmath61 order parameter that is associated with @xmath32- and @xmath19-filling crystals on the triangular lattice . for the case of the @xmath19-filling lobe",

    "sr , @xmath73 for lr  sr and @xmath68 for lr - lr ) so that each system will posses all the possible phases : crystal , superfluid , and supersolid .",
    "each cut is investigated for @xmath83 at a system size of @xmath33 .",
    "first , we analyze the structure factor to study how the @xmath31 crystal melts with an increase in temperature ( second row of fig .",
    "[ ssmelt ] ) . for the sr ",
    "sr interactions , even at a temperature of @xmath84 there still exists a bump in the structure factor which indicates that the crystal has not completely melted yet , while for both of the long - ranged lobes the crystal melts by @xmath85 .",
    "interestingly , the sr  sr crystal and the lr  lr crystal are approximately the same size at @xmath38 , but by @xmath86 one has melted while the other still exists .",
    "that means that the system with short - ranged interactions holds its crystal structure better at higher temperatures than does our system with all long - ranged interactions .",
    "looking at the lr  sr lobe , we see that its crystal at this cut starts off smaller , yet it melts at about the same temperature as the one for lr  lr interactions .",
    "it seems that the dipolar repulsion helps stabilize the crystal structure over a larger temperature range , while the long - ranged hopping destroys the crystal more quickly because of the extra kinetic energy .",
    "maybe more importantly , we now study the melting of the supersolid for these same cuts .",
    "figure [ ssmelt ] shows the structure factor , superfluidity , and supersolidity as a function of temperature for each of the different systems .",
    "since the supersolid is defined by having both non - zero structure factor and non - zero superfluid fraction , by combining the graphs we are able to see where these regions exist and also how they melt with increased temperature ( the bottom row of fig .  [ ssmelt ] shows a product of structure factor and superfluid fraction , which remains finite only where the two coexist ) . a common feature of all the graphs are the spikes on either side of the plateaus .",
    "these are regions where a phase transition occurs but does not necessarily imply that a supersolid region exists .",
    "most likely , these features appear due to the finite size of the system and the resulting smooth transitions of superfluid fraction and structure factor . at larger sizes , the transitions would be much sharper at these points , the regions where a finite structure factor and superfluid fraction coexist would shrink , and the spikes would diminish . from the previous section , we can assume that for the sr ",
    "sr system they would disappear completely at the upper transition from the crystal lobe while for the other two systems there would still exist a small supersolid region .    returning to the main focus , the small-@xmath2 region , we see that in each case a supersolid region appears that extends from the left side of the plateau all the way to @xmath63 . in every system",
    ", this supersolid region also exists for a finite range of temperatures . for sr ",
    "sr interactions , it gradually decreases but still extends all the way out past @xmath86 . for the lr  sr interactions , the supersolid region again slowly melts but now disappears at @xmath87 , just below the spot where the crystal melted .",
    "the supersolid region for the lr  lr system appears to have the largest magnitude of the three systems , but then rapidly melts at @xmath85 .    , lr  sr at @xmath81 and lr  lr at @xmath68 ( left to right ) .",
    "all cuts are taken at @xmath63 .",
    "the structure factor ( solid blue ) attains similar values for all three systems .",
    "the superfluid fraction ( dashed black ) is largest in the lr  lr system and melts fastest in the lr",

    "lr at @xmath68 ( left to right ) .",

    "the superfluid fraction ( dashed black ) is largest in the lr  lr system and melts fastest in the lr ",
    "sr one.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]    in order to compare these transitions more quantitatively , we take a cut along @xmath63 for each system , shown in fig .",
    "[ mumelt ] .",
    "all three systems show a relatively similar and steady value for the structure factor .",
    "hence , the values of the superfluid fraction are going to determine the existence of the supersolid regions .",
    "the first plot shows the sr ",
    "sr system at the @xmath82 cut , and we can see that the superfluid fraction stays non - zero all the way out to @xmath88 .",
    "the lr  sr system has a very similar behavior at the @xmath73 cut , but in this case the supersolid is nearly completely melted by @xmath88 .",
    "the final plot is the lr  lr system at @xmath68 , which behaves slightly differently .",
    "the most important difference is that the starting value of the superfluid fraction is higher than in the first two plots .",
    "this should therefore make the supersolid region more pronounced .",
    "but even though the superfluid fraction has the highest value for this system , it decays more quickly and reaches values similar to the sr ",

    "in this paper , we have presented a quantum monte carlo study of dipolar spin models that describe various systems of ultracold atoms , molecules , and ions .",
    "we have presented predictions concerning the phase diagram of the considered systems at zero and finite temperatures , and described the appearance and some properties of the superfluid , supersolid , and crystalline phases .",
    "while the results are not surprising and resemble earlier obtained results for similar systems in 1d and 2d , the main advantage of our study is that it is directly relevant to the current experiments :    * the results for the xxz model with short - range tunneling apply for ultracold gases of polar bosonic molecules in the limit of hard - core bosons .",
    "note that the earlier works @xcite have concentrated on the appearance of the supersolid phase and devil s staircase of crystalline phases in the square lattice @xcite , and supersolid and emulsion phases in the triangular lattice @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the hard - core - spin limit , and compare it and stress differences with other models , such as the ones with long - range tunneling , i.e. , long - range xx interactions . *",
    "the results for the xxz models with long - range tunneling apply for systems of trapped ions in triangular lattices of microtraps .",
    "these results are novel , since so far such models have been only studied using various techniques in 1d , and using the mean - field approach in 2d . while the first experimental demonstrations of such models were restricted to a few ions",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) , many experimental groups are working on an extension of such ionic quantum simulators to systems of many ions in microtraps @xcite .",
    "in fact , very recently the nist group has engineered 2d ising interactions in a trapped - ion quantum simulator with hundreds of spins @xcite .",
    "although in this experiment the quantum regime has not yet been achieved , it clearly opens the way toward quantum simulators of spin models with long - range interactions .",
    "we expect that in the near future the result of our present theoretical study will become directly relevant for experiments .",
