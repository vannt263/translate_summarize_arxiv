    "observational evidences from ia supernovae , cmbr via wmap , galaxy redshift surveys via sdss indicated that the universe have entered a phase of accelerated expansion of late @xcite . with this discovery the incompleteness of general relativity ( gr ) as a self sufficient theory of gravity came into foreground .",
    "since no possible explanation of this phenomenon could be attributed inside the framework of einstein s gr , a proper modification of the theory was required that will successfully incorporate the late cosmic acceleration .",
    "as the quest began , two different approaches regarding this modification came into light .    according to the first approach ,",
    "cosmic acceleration can be phenomenally attributed to the presence of a mysterious negative energy component popularly known as _ dark energy ( de ) _",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we modify the right hand side of the einstein s equation , i.e. in the matter sector of the universe .",
    "latest observational data shows that the contribution of de to the energy sector of the universe is @xmath1 . with the passage of time ,",
    "extensive search saw various candidates for de appear in the scene .",
    "some of the popular ones worth mentioning are chaplygin gas models @xcite , quintessence scalar field @xcite , phantom energy field @xcite , etc .",
    "a basic feature of these models is that , they violate the strong energy condition i.e. , @xmath2 , thus producing the observed cosmic acceleration .",
    "recent reviews on de can be found in @xcite    a different section of cosmologists resorted to an alternative approach for explaining the expansion .",
    "this concept is based on the modification of the gravity sector of gr , thus giving birth to modified gravity theories . a universe associated with a tiny cosmological constant ,",
    "i.e. the @xmath3cdm model served as a prototype for this approach .",
    "it was seen that the model could satisfactorily explain the recent cosmic acceleration and passed a few solar system tests as well . but with detailed diagnosis it was revealed that the model was paralyzed with a few cosmological problems . out of these ,",
    "two major problems that crippled the model till date are the fine tuning problem ( ftp ) and the cosmic coincidence problem ( ccp ) .",
    "the ftp refers to the large discrepancy between the observed values and the theoretically predicted values of cosmological parameters .",
    "numerous attempts to solve this problem can be found in the literature . among them ,",
    "the most impressive attempt was undertaken by weinberg in @xcite .",
    "although the approaches for the solutions are different , yet , almost all of them are basically based on the fact that the cosmological constant may not assume an extremely small static value at all times during the evolution of the universe ( as predicted by gr ) , but its nature should be rather dynamical @xcite .",
    "these drawbacks reduced the effectiveness of the model , as well as its acceptability , and hence alternative modifications of gravity was sought for .",
    "some of the popular models of modified gravity that came into existence in recent times are loop quantum gravity @xcite , brane gravity @xcite , _",

    "the energy momentum tensor of matter is defined as @xmath11 we assume that the matter lagrangian density depends only on the metric tensor components @xmath12 so that @xmath13 taking the variation of the action with respect to the metric tensor , we get the field equations for the _",
    "f(r , t ) _ gravity as follows , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the covariant derivative associated with the levi - civita connection of the metric and @xmath16 .",
    "subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 represents derivative with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively and @xmath17 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the matter is given as @xmath18 using this the field eqns .",
    "( 4 ) gives , @xmath19 here we will consider non - relativistic matter , i.e. , cold dark matter and baryons @xmath20 .",
    "so its obvious that the torsion contribution is totally coming from ordinary matter .",
    "an effective einstein eqn . can be written from eqn.(6 ) as follows , @xmath21 where the effective gravitational matter dependant coupling in @xmath0 gravity is given by , @xmath22 and the energy momentum tensor for dark energy is given by , @xmath23\\ ] ] here prime denotes the non - equilibrium description of the field equations .",
    "now the metric describing the frw universe is given by , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the metric @xmath28 .",
    "obviously @xmath29 is the time dependant scale factor , @xmath30 is the scalar curvature and @xmath31 is the metric for the two - dimensional unit sphere . now",
    "the field equations for the frw universe can be given as follows , @xmath32\\ ] ] @xmath33\\ ] ] we re - write these eqns .",

    "the energy conservation equations for matter and dark sector are respectively given by , @xmath41 and @xmath42    here @xmath43 is the eos parameter of the energy sector and @xmath44 is the interaction between the matter and the energy sector of the universe .",
    "the eos parameter of the dark fluid is obtained as , @xmath45",
    "the cosmic coincidence problem has been a serious issue in recent times regarding various otherwise successful models of the universe . from the recent cosmological observations",
    "it is noted that the densities of the matter sector and the de sector of the universe are almost identical in late times .",
    "this observation gives rise to a problem when we relate this to the fact that the matter and the energy component of the universe have evolved independently from different mass scales in the early universe .",
    "then how do they reconcile to identical mass scales in the late universe !",
    "this is a major cosmological problem having its roots in the very formation of the models .",
    "almost all the models of universe known till date more or less suffer from this phenomenon .",
    "numerous attempts to address the coincidence problem can be widely found in literature . among them",
    "the most impressive are the ones which introduce a suitable interaction between the matter and the energy components of the universe , as given in the conservation equations ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) .",
    "this approach makes use of the fact that the two sectors of the universe have not evolved independently from different mass scales , but have actually evolved together , interacting with each other , thus allowing a mutual flow of matter and energy between the two components . due to this exchange , difference of densities , if any , gets diluted and a stationary scenario is witnessed in the present universe . although the concept seems to be a really promising one , yet a problem persists . till date",
    "there is no universally accepted interaction term , introduced by a fundamental theory .",
    "an attempt to address the coincidence problem in @xmath4 gravity can be found in @xcite .",
    "similar attempts in @xmath8 and @xmath5 gravities can be found in @xcite respectively .",
    "a study of triple interacting de model can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is known that both dark energy and dark matter are not universally accepted facts , but concepts which are still at the speculation level . due to this unknown nature of both dark energy and dark matter , it is not possible to derive an expression for the interaction term ( @xmath44 ) from the first principles .",
    "such a situation , demands us to use our logical reasoning and propose various expressions for @xmath44 that will be reasonably acceptable .",
    "the late time dominating nature of dark energy indicates that @xmath44 must be considered a small and positive value . on the other hand a large negative value of interaction will make the universe dark energy dominated from the early times , thus leaving no scope for the condensation of galaxies .",
    "so the most logical choice for interaction should contain a product of energy density and the hubble parameter , because it is not only physically but also dimensionally justified .",
    "so @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the dark energy density .",
    "since here we are not planning to add any dark energy by hand , so the effective density resulting from the _ f(r , t ) _ gravity , @xmath36 will replace @xmath47 .",
    "this leads us to three basic forms of interactions as given below @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the coupling parameters of the respective interaction models .",
    "it is worth mentioning that due to its simplicity as well as viability , the most widely used interaction model is the @xmath49-model and is available widely in literature @xcite .",
    "in this note we address the coincidence problem in _ f(r , t ) _ gravity .",
    "_ f(r , t ) _ gravity has evolved over the past few years as a candidate for modified gravity theory . from the literature it is known that _",
    "f(r , t ) _ gravity is itself self competent in producing the late cosmic acceleration without resorting to any forms of dark energy . therefore in order to keep it simple and reasonable , we do not consider any separate dark energy component by hand in the present study .",
    "the energy component evolving from the gravity theory itself is considered as the dark component responsible for the cosmic acceleration .",
    "the ratio of the densities of matter and dark energy is considered as , @xmath52 .",
    "our prime objective is to devise a set - up that will take us close to a possible solution of the coincidence problem .",
    "we also want to set up a filtering process that will screen the favorable @xmath0 models , that produce a stationary scenario of the component densities , @xmath53 from the unfavorable ones which do not .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath53 is as follows , @xmath54 using eqns .",

    "we use a two parameter reconstruction function for @xmath80 @xcite @xmath81 on fitting this model to gold data set , we get @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite .",

    ", we have @xmath88 and thus @xmath89 .",
    "so in the early stage , where there is only radiation @xmath90 then @xmath91 . in the late universe , when we have only matter @xmath92",
    ". therefore we consider our scale factor as ,    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is a constant .    in order to illustrate the above set - up",
    "numerically we consider three different @xmath0 gravity models found in literature and test them for the coincidence phenomenon .",
    "these models are used because they pass most of the cosmological and solar system tests .",

    "expressions for @xmath112 and @xmath113 are also found for all the three gravity models . as it can be seen from above that the expressions are really lengthy",
    ", so we do not include all of them in the manuscript .",
    "we have generated plots for @xmath107 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 against cosmic time , @xmath114 for each of the three models in the figures 1 , 2 and 3 , for all the three forms of interactions , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",

    "from the figures it is evident that the stationary scenario is not realized for all the three models when the cosmic time corresponds to the age of the universe , i.e. @xmath117 years .",
    "it is seen that near the zero line the trajectories assume asymptotic nature .",
    "thus there is no realistic possibility of the trajectory to intersect the zero axis , producing a non - stationary scenario .",
    "the asymptotic nature of the curves are indicative of the fact that as time evolves the trajectories move closer and closer to the zero mark thus alleviating the coincidence problem substantially , but never produces a satisfactory solution .",

    "in all the three cases , the trajectories for model 2 and 3 coincide with each other .",
    "the trajectory for model 1 is distinct from the other models in case of b - interaction .",
    "but in case of @xmath50 and @xmath51 interactions even the trajectory for model 1 move closer to the other trajectories almost coinciding with them",
    ".    in @xcite coincidence problem has been addressed in @xmath8 and @xmath5 gravity models respectively . in both these assignments",
    "the b - interaction has been identified as the most suitable form of interaction describing the late universe .",
    "but in the present study , there is no such reason to consider the above mentioned fact .",
    "but it should be mentioned that the present study resembles the study in @xcite in the fact that in both the papers coincidence scenario is not realized for the well - known models of the respective gravity theories .",
    "finally it must be stated that from the set - up that we have designed in this assignment , we can generate as well as filter various models of @xmath0 gravity which are completely free from the coincidence problem . for the time being we keep it as a future assignment .",
