    "recently eisenstein and collaborators @xcite , using data from the sloan digital sky survey , published evidence for features in the matter power spectrum on scales of @xmath1mpc .",
    "these features , long predicted , hold the promise of another route to understanding the expansion history of the universe and the influence of dark energy .",
    "it was realized very early @xcite that a universe with non - negligible baryon fraction would result in significant features in the matter power spectrum due to the coupling of the baryons to ( hot ) photons in the early universe .",
    "when the universe was dense and highly ionized the baryons and photons were tightly coupled by thomson scattering . during this phase",
    "the amplitude of baryon - photon perturbations can not grow , but rather undergo harmonic motion with a slowly decaying amplitude .",
    "slightly after recombination the baryons decouple from the radiation and the oscillations are frozen in  leading to subtle features in the total matter power spectrum analogous to the ( fractionally much larger ) features in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . the first calculations to emphasize the oscillations in the context of hot big - bang cdm models were @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] the matter and radiation power spectra , in @xmath2-space , for a @xmath3cdm model ( see below ) .",
    "these spectra were computed by numerical evolution of the coupled einstein , fluid and boltzmann equations as described in @xcite .",
    "a description of the physics leading to the oscillations can be found in @xcite or appendix a of @xcite .",
    "while the precise relationship between the positions of the peaks in the radiation and matter power spectra is complex , the same physics underlies both and they share a common scale : the sound horizon @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the sound speed and the measured value is taken from @xcite . the peaks in the radiation spectrum occur roughly at @xmath6 for integer @xmath7 , the peaks in the matter spectrum are almost out of phase .",
    "it was pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite that this scale could be used as a standard ruler to constrain the distance - redshift relation , the expansion of the universe and dark energy .",
    "numerous authors @xcite have now observed that a high-@xmath8 galaxy survey forest @xcite or in very large cluster surveys @xcite .",
    "] covering upwards of several hundred square degrees could place interesting constraints on dark energy .",
    "key to realizing this is the ability to accurately predict , from measurements of the cmb , the physical scale at which the oscillations appear in the power spectrum plus the means to localize those primordial features in observations of galaxy spectra which necessarily involve galaxy bias , non - linear evolution and redshift space distortions .",
    "the former problem seems well in hand @xcite .",
    "we make some preliminary investigations of the latter problem in this paper .",
    "the real space , linear theory matter power spectrum can be computed with high accuracy @xcite , however we measure the non - linear galaxy power spectrum in redshift space .",
    "our understanding of the transformation between these two is improving rapidly , along with our ability to simulate the complex processes involved .",
    "thus to some degree the effects of non - linearity , bias and redshift space distortions can be predicted .",
    "however , we would like to reduce our dependence on detailed theoretical calculations as much as possible .",
    "one possibility is to parameterize the additional effects and measure the parameters along with the sound horizon .",
    "this amounts to marginalizing over a range of models for the additional physics , inflating the error bars on the cosmological parameters but reducing sensitivity to improper modeling of non - linearity , bias or redshift space distortions . in general",
    "we would like to allow enough freedom in our fit to account for the effects while not degrading too severely our constraint on the peak locations . improved theoretical modeling of non - linearity , bias and redshift space distortions translate into stronger priors on the `` extra physics '' parameters in this framework .",
    "non - linearity , galaxy bias and redshift space distortions are all expected to be `` simple '' on large scales .",
    "each has a characteristic scale associated with it .",
    "for non - linearity the scale is @xmath9mpc for @xmath10 ( see  [ sec : results ] ) . for redshift space distortions",
    "the scale is set by the velocity dispersion of the largest halos @xcite . at @xmath11",
    "we expect @xmath12mpc .",
    "galaxy bias is expected to become simple on large scales @xcite and in halo - based models @xcite the transition is set by the virial radius of the largest halo , @xmath13mpc .",
    "thus it makes sense to fit , for @xmath14 , @xmath15 with @xmath16 the dimensionless power spectrum , @xmath17 of the mass , in real space , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are polynomials in @xmath2 . within the halo model",
    "@xmath18 describes the @xmath20-halo term while @xmath19 describes the @xmath21-halo term @xcite .",
    "since we are not computing @xmath18 and @xmath19 from a halo model formalism , but merely exploring the relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath16 , we will take a slightly simpler approach ( see later ) of absorbing @xmath19 into a scale dependent bias , @xmath23 .",
    "we note that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite make a different reduction by taking @xmath24constant and absorbing any scale - dependence into @xmath19 .    as an example of the above approach we could expand the corrections to our best fit theory in hermite polynomials , @xmath25 , which are bounded by @xmath26 .",
    "theoretical priors would then take the form of limits on the size of the correction coefficients , for example @xmath27 is a gaussian of zero mean and dispersion @xmath28 which parameterizes the residual uncertainty in our modeling .",
    "in this paper we make a preliminary investigation of the structure of these functions using numerical simulations .",
    "the basis for our calculations is a sequence of particle - mesh ( pm ) simulations of a @xmath3cdm cosmology ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) in a periodic , cubical box of side @xmath34mpc=@xmath35gpc .",
    "the main simulation evolved @xmath36 particles of mass @xmath37 from @xmath38 to @xmath39 with a regular mesh of @xmath40 points used to compute the forces .",
    "outputs at both fixed time and along a light-``cone '' were produced at @xmath41 , 3 , 2 , 1.5 , 1 , 0.3 and 0 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dmslice ] ) . to make the geometry easier for analysis",
    "we assumed the infinitely distant observer approximation in producing the light - cone outputs .",
    "the rays did not converge on the origin , but rather were all parallel to the @xmath42-axis of the simulation box , respecting the periodic nature of the simulation .",
    "for some of our results on the rarer , more massive halos we used a series of 9 lower resolution ( @xmath43 ) simulations with the same size box .    for the initial conditions we used the linear theory power spectrum from fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] and displaced particles from a `` fuzzy '' regular grid using the zeldovich approximation . for the main simulation we picked random phases , but for the amplitudes of the low-@xmath2 modes we chose an abnormally common set .",
    "the power spectrum at low-@xmath2 thus shows significantly less scatter than a rayleigh distribution , making it easier to see the baryonic features . moving to higher @xmath2 , with more modes in the box",
    ", we gradually moved to a rayleigh distribution so that the initial conditions properly sampled a gaussian distribution .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the effects of galaxy modeling , redshift space distortions and light - cone evolution the exact initial conditions are merely a convenience .",
    "for the smaller runs we chose unconstrained gaussian initial conditions , since we can average over several realizations .    for each output",
    "we generate a catalog of halos using the friends - of - friends algorithm @xcite with a linking length of @xmath44 in units of the mean inter - particle spacing .",
    "this procedure partitions the particles into equivalence classes , by linking together all particle pairs separated by less than a distance @xmath45 .",
    "the groups correspond roughly to all particles above a density of @xmath46 times the background density and we keep all groups with more than 20 particles .    the huge advantage of a pm simulation over one involving higher force resolution is its speed or low cost .",
    "the current simulations , plus all of the post - processing took only @xmath47 cpu hours on the ibm - sp seaborg at nersc  a few percent of the resources required for the hubble volume @xcite or millennium runs @xcite .",
    "it is easy to conceive of running large numbers of pm simulations of this size to explore parameter space or provide statistical samples  but is a pm simulation adequate ?",
    "we would like to follow a large number of particles to accurately evolve the modes in the quasi - linear regime , but the baryon oscillation scales are very large so do nt require a huge dynamic range .",
    "indeed pm simulations on a 1990 s era mid - level desktop workstation were perfectly adequate to resolve the relevant gravitational physics and explore simple models of galaxy bias @xcite .",
    "our main simulation resolves the relevant scales with hundreds of mesh cells in each dimension .",
    "the issue of galaxy modeling is more subtle .",
    "clearly our simulations are not correctly resolving the internal structure of dark matter halos hosting galaxies , and are completely unable to resolve sub - structure .",
    "this makes careful modeling of galaxy formation impossible .",
    "we shall take a different approach however . rather than trying to model as accurately as possible the physics of galaxy formation",
    ", we shall try to get a feel for the range of possibilities afforded by models in which galaxies form in dark matter halos .",
    "if we are willing to make assumptions about the spatial and velocity distribution of galaxies in halos and their halo occupation distribution then we need only resolve the positions and masses of the hosting halos in the simulation in order to make realistic mock catalogs ",
    "an approach similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "fortunately the masses and positions of the halos are reasonably well modeled , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : grppos ] .",
    "the figure shows the @xmath48 and @xmath49 positions of halos which would host galaxies in a thin slice through two simulations .",
    "both simulations have the same initial conditions , one is run with a high force resolution code @xcite and one with the pm code , run in this paper is in fact slightly higher than that shown in the figure  which was done before the large run was started . ] . the overall agreement in positions and masses",
    "is very good , although there is a tendency for the pm simulation to merge some close halos that the higher resolution simulation resolves as discrete .",
    "a few of the halos seen in one simulation but not the other have their centers falling just outside of the thin slice in one run but inside in the other .",
    "the mass function of the simulation at @xmath50 , 1 and 0.3 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massfn ] compared to the fitting function of ref .",
    "there is a shortfall at lower masses and an excess at the very rare , high mass end ",
    "the excess appears to come from the initial conditions used , the shortfall at low mass comes from the finite force resolution . for halos in the most interesting range for us , few @xmath51  @xmath52",
    ", the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "based on these comparisons we believe that our simulations , while inappropriate to model small scale clustering , are adequate for our purposes .",
    ".the hod parameters , for the form of eq .",
    "[ eqn : hod ] , we have used for some of our models at @xmath53 .",
    "masses are in units of @xmath54 and the number density for all models is @xmath55 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to make the mock galaxy samples we then take an output and choose a mean occupancy of halos : @xmath56 .",
    "each halo either hosts a central galaxy or does not . for each halo",
    "we define a galaxy to live at the minimum of the halo potential , with the center of mass velocity , with probability @xmath57 $ ] . following ref .",
    "@xcite , if @xmath58 the mean number of satellites , @xmath59 , is computed for the halo and a poisson random number , @xmath60 , drawn . then @xmath60 dark matter particles , chosen at random but with weights depending on their radial distance from the potential minimum , are anointed as galaxies .",
    "our fiducial model has equal weights  the satellite galaxies trace the dark matter . the galaxy velocity is taken to be @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the particle velocity and @xmath63 is the velocity of the halo center - of - mass and our fiducial model has @xmath64 , i.e.  @xmath65 .",
    "the result is a set of `` galaxies '' whose clustering properties can be computed . while the galaxy model is not prescriptive , or likely even close to `` right '' , it is physically well motivated , easy to adjust and leads to galaxy catalogs with non - linear , scale - dependent , stochastic ( and in principle luminosity dependent ) biasing , redshift space distortions and ( later ) light - cone effects .",
    "even with the distribution of galaxies chosen there is still tremendous freedom in specifying @xmath66 . for this initial exploration",
    "we choose a very simple two - parameter form with @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the heavyside step function .",
    "if we take @xmath69 our catalog reduces to a catalog of halos more massive than @xmath70 . by holding @xmath71 fixed",
    "we can specify a 1-parameter sequence of models with varying @xmath70 or large - scale bias , @xmath72 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias ] .",
    "a selection of models is given in table [ tab : hod ] .",
    "for most of our results we will concentrate on the @xmath53 output .",
    "we still do not know what the best sample of galaxies is for detecting baryon oscillations at @xmath53 . since it is not our intention to model a particular strategy we will choose @xmath73  at the upper end of the range advocated by @xcite for @xmath53 .",
    "we find for samples with lower number density the shot - noise correction is very large .",
    "the dot dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pkmm ] shows the value for @xmath74 . ] and the sampling noise unacceptably high for our limited volume .",
    "a density of @xmath75 is close to the observed number density of the sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample with @xmath76 .",
    "these galaxies have a large - scale bias of approximately two @xcite . in our model , at this redshift , we can fit the number density and bias with @xmath77 and @xmath78 . if we imagine the hod does nt evolve with redshift , and with @xmath79 this large , the lrgs are essentially the central galaxy population of halos above @xmath70 . since this mass is quite large , and the halos quite rare , we use the lower resolution runs to study such massive halos . in future , with more simulations in hand , we could enlarge our study to other populations .",
    "finally we note that for all of these number densities the contribution to the power spectrum from shot - noise , assuming it is poisson , is as large as the signal on scales of @xmath80 .",
    "this is no accident  in the gauss - poisson limit the optimal survey strategy for constraining the power spectrum is to balance the cosmic variance and shot - noise power @xcite .",
    "thus shot - noise subtraction is an important part of the power spectrum calculation and deserves further study .",
    "we begin by looking at the evolution of the dark matter .",
    "the dimensionless power spectrum of the mass , in real space , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pkmm ] along with the linear theory predictions .",
    "the power spectrum was computed by assigning the particles to the nearest grid point of a regular , @xmath36 cartesian mesh and fourier transforming the resultant density field .",
    "the resulting @xmath81 , corrected for the assignment to the grid using the appropriate window function , were placed in logarithmically spaced bins of @xmath2 .",
    "the average @xmath81 is plotted at the position of the average @xmath2 in each bin .",
    "[ fig : pkmm ] shows the effects of non - linear evolution on the power spectrum .",
    "the trends are familiar @xcite : first a decrease in power , compared to linear theory , in the trans - linear regime followed by an increase in the non - linear regime .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : pkmm ] that the mode coupling induced by non - linear evolution erases the oscillations at high-@xmath2 @xcite , with the feature just beyond @xmath82 being unavailable at low-@xmath8 .",
    "the scale of non - linearity , where @xmath83 , is only an approximate guide to the redshift dependence of the mode coupling because of the increasing flatness of @xmath84 as we push to higher @xmath2 . even though one can still see remnants of the oscillatory features at @xmath85 , the @xmath2-modes are no longer independent @xcite .",
    "an accurate calculation of the covariance matrix requires more simulations than we have in hand @xcite .",
    "given its importance for parameter forecasts however we make an estimate from our 9 lower resolution runs  for the @xmath53 mass power , neighboring bins are correlated at the many tens of percent level beyond @xmath82 increasing to above 90% for @xmath86 .",
    "further mapping of these correlations is left for future work .",
    "[ fig : red ] shows the effect of redshift space distortions on the angle - averaged power spectrum .",
    "the power is enhanced , by a @xmath8-dependent factor , on large scales due to supercluster infall @xcite and suppressed on small scales due to virial motions within halos . the power spectrum in redshift space",
    "was computed assuming the distant observer approximation for all outputs and the periodicity of the simulation was used to remap positions .",
    "the power ratios do not recover to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite on large scales .",
    "a test with a different random number choice for the initial conditions came closer for the lowest @xmath2 modes , indicating that sampling variance accounts for some of the disagreement .",
    "whether we should reach the limits shown on the scales relevant to baryon oscillations remains in doubt  see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for further discussion .",
    "now we turn to the halo and galaxy catalogues , first in real space .",
    "[ fig : halobias ] shows the scale - dependent bias of halos more massive than @xmath70 at @xmath53 . here",
    "bias is defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the non - linear dark matter spectrum ",
    "the bias thus contains a mix of non - linear and galaxy formation physics .",
    "since the features we are looking for are small , we fit a linear trend ( in @xmath89 ) to each set of points over the range @xmath90 and plot the ratio of the bias to the fit in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : halobias ] .",
    "what we would like to see is the points being essentially unity .    for the most numerous halos",
    "a jackknife estimate suggests that the error bars are smaller than 3% on scales @xmath91 , though the errors are correlated .",
    "one must be careful of jackknife estimates on scales approaching the box size , but nonetheless this implies that any structure is smaller than the signal near @xmath92 ( but may influence the peak positions at the accuracy with which they need to be determined to constrain dark energy ) . unfortunately the errors increase as we go to the rarer halos , and for @xmath93 the errors are 2 - 7% over the range @xmath90 .",
    "for this reason we switch to the lower resolution runs for the halos with @xmath94 and use the dispersion between simulations to estimate the errors .",
    "we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : halobias ] some curvature remaining after the linear trend is removed .",
    "the size of the curvature is small , and could be simply noise from the finite number of modes simulated .",
    "it is also possible that this reflects a modulation in the bias of rare halos ( which in the peaks formalism @xcite depends strongly on the linear mass variance ) when compared to the underlying non - linear power of the dark matter . in either case",
    "the modulation appears to be smooth , and of lower amplitude than the baryon signal .",
    "next we show results for some of our galaxy catalogues , with @xmath73 . the trend - removed bias is shown in fig .  [ fig : relbias_g ] . at the level required for baryon oscillations",
    "the bias is clearly not constant , exhibiting curvature once the best - fit line is removed .",
    "a comparison of catalogues produced with different random number seeds gives some sense of the error , but only enters in the positions of the satellite galaxies .",
    "a jackknife estimate of the errors suggests they are less than 2% in the range @xmath90 for all of the models , again with the usual caveat about jackknife errors . for the models with the largest @xmath70 , which show the biggest curvature , we can use the 9 lower resolution runs to estimate the significance of the curvature",
    "the agreement is fairly good between the average of the 9 low resolution runs and our fiducial model , with the former showing an error around 1% over the @xmath2-range shown .",
    "now we shift to redshift space . the low-@xmath2 redshift space enhancements for our galaxy and halo catalogues are ( fractionally ) smaller than for the matter , due to the positive bias of the tracers @xcite .",
    "the models with a satellite galaxy component show a suppression at high-@xmath2 that begins slightly before that in the matter while the centers of halos show much less suppression , with the real and redshift space power comparable at high-@xmath2 .",
    "the latter is due to our assumption that the central halo velocity is the center of mass velocity of the halo .",
    "this suppresses the virial motions for these points , and it is the virial motion which leads to the depletion of small - scale power . the actual velocity of central galaxies in halos can be determined observationally from their power spectrum , and is likely to be higher than our center of mass model assumes . since the power suppression is relatively smooth our approximation will not alter our basic conclusions .    in principle",
    "there is more information in the redshift space power spectrum than shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : red ] because it is no longer isotropic .",
    "we shall not investigate this degree of freedom in this paper .",
    "though in principle the information is included in the simulations , our computational volume is too small to allow multiple sub - divisions of the sample while maintaining reasonable significance . for the angle - averaged power spectrum it is clear that on the scales relevant to the oscillations redshift space distortions are a very slowly varying function for @xmath95 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : postfit ] shows a slightly different view of these results .",
    "here we show the redshift space , galaxy power spectrum at @xmath53 divided by the featureless linear theory prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite and a constant bias fit to the points @xmath96 .",
    "superposed is the linear theory prediction from numerical integration of the coupled einstein , boltzmann and fluid equations @xcite .",
    "the degree to which these differ shows the level of correction that needs to be applied .    from these studies",
    "it appears that a cubic fit ( in @xmath89 ) to the bias is sufficient to remove the scale dependence of the bias to the percent level in the range @xmath90 .",
    "this deviation is approximately the same size as the error in our calculation . to quantify this",
    "better would require more or larger simulations .",
    "the coupling of baryons and photons by thomson scattering in the early universe leads to a rich structure in the power spectra of the cmb photons and the matter .",
    "the study of the former has revolutionized cosmology and allowed precise measurement of a host of important cosmological parameters .",
    "the study of the latter is still in its infancy , but holds the potential to constrain the nature of the dark energy believed to be causing the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "key to the baryon oscillation program is the ability to compare future observations to theoretical computations of the features in the matter power spectrum .",
    "such calculations are under exquisite control in linear theory @xcite and the next stage is to explore the effects of non - linear evolution , galaxy biasing and redshift space distortions .",
    "non - linear evolution can be straightforwardly modeled with the current generation of n - body simulations , so the main difficulty lies in understanding or parameterizing galaxy formation .",
    "there have been tremendous advances in our ability to model and understand the relation between galaxies and halos in the last few years .",
    "the earlier generation of biasing models @xcite were highly simplistic , and today we can do significantly better using halo based schemes @xcite . indeed results based on sophisticated modeling of galaxies within halos @xcite or in the limit where the halos are the tracers @xcite have already been published .",
    "modeling along similar lines to that done here has recently been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . where this is overlap",
    "our results are in good agreement .",
    "in this paper we explored a number of phenomenological models for populating halos in pm simulations with galaxies . while unlikely to be correct in any detail these schemes serve to delineate the range of behaviors we might expect in the real universe .",
    "we find that non - linearity , galaxy bias and redshift space distortions all introduce important modifications to the basic picture .",
    "both the galaxy bias and the ( isotropic ) redshift space distortions lead to relatively smooth modulations in power on the scales of interest to baryon oscillations , at least to the level of accuracy we are able to achieve here .",
    "the halo and galaxy power spectra exhibit low order structure beyond the acoustic oscillations over the range of scales of relevance .",
    "fitting a cubic polynomial to the ratio of galaxy to dark matter power reduces any remaining structure in the range @xmath0 below the 2% level , comparable to the uncertainty in our calculations . for future , ambitious",
    ", surveys even this level of uncertainty may represent a significant piece of the error budget on dark energy properties .",
    "redshift space distortions remain to be explored in more detail .",
    "the relative velocity of central galaxies and halos affects the redshift space power spectrum of the former on interesting scales , and has not been well modeled here .",
    "in addition there is useful information in the angular structure of the redshift space distortions which we do not have the statistics to explore carefully .",
    "we hope to return to some of these issues in a future publication .",
    "future large redshift surveys offer the opportunity to measure a characteristic scale in the universe : the sound horizon at the time of photon - baryon decoupling .",
    "this standard ruler , which we can calibrate from observations of the cmb , may allow us to tightly constrain the evolution of the scale factor and determine the nature of dark energy . to ensure the success of these efforts we need to improve our understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of the method and generate simulated universes which can be used to refine and test our observational strategies .",
