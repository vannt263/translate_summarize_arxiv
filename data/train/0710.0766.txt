    "diffraction of light and matter waves lies at the heart of a number of diagnostic measurement techniques in physics and engineering . due to their internal level structure",
    ", atoms and molecules can be diffracted by resonant or near resonant laser beams @xcite .",
    "the field of atom optics points to applications for high precision probing of inertial effects and fundamental physics @xcite , as well as to the use of diffraction to diagnose single- and multi - particle properties of the atoms themselves in various physical settings @xcite .",
    "the use of light induced potentials for structured deposition of atoms on surfaces has also been demonstrated @xcite . by use of laguerre - gaussian laser beams ,",
    "atomic diffraction was recently used to transfer not only linear but also angular momentum to an atomic gas @xcite . by tailoring the polarization and frequencies of light , it is possible to induce complicated multi - level dynamics with various potential applications @xcite . for most species , using optical pumping and suitable polarization schemes , it is also possible to restrict the dynamics and to obtain a situation of effective propagation of a single component wave function in a single periodic potential @xcite .",
    "the coupling of atomic momentum components by absorption and stimulated emission events to a comb of other momentum states separated by twice the photon momentum can not be solved analytically due to the non - commuting kinetic and potential energies .",
    "however , for two parameter regimes simple analytical solutions have been known for a long time . in the raman - nath regime of short pulse durations ,",
    "the difference in kinetic energy of different momentum states is neglected and the coupling leads to an expansion with bessel - function expression for different momentum component amplitudes @xcite . in the bragg regime of long and weak pulses , kinetic energy must be strictly conserved by absorption and emission of an integer number of counter - propagating photon pairs , and the system reduces to an effective , analytically tractable , two - level system .",
    "atomic diffraction is applied extensively in experiments , and the need for numerical and analytical theoretical approaches beyond the range of validity of the raman - nath and the bragg theoretical treatments , is explicitly expressed in the recent literature @xcite . here",
    "we depart from the raman - nath approach , and suggest an analytical formula which extends into the channeling regime .",
    "our analytical expression , includes effects due to the kinetic energy dispersion , and deploying numerical simulations we show that it extends the range of validity of the simple raman - nath approach into the channeling regime where both raman - nath and bragg descriptions fail . in section",
    "ii , we introduce our analytical and improved approximate theories . in sec .",

    "[ f1 ] , respectively.,width=325 ]    we consider an atom with mass @xmath3 , two atomic levels with energy level separation @xmath4 , and dipole matrix element @xmath5 , interacting with two counter - propagating laser field pulses , @xmath6 we imagine that the two pulses arrive at the origin , @xmath7 , symmetrically from opposite directions . for realistic atomic and field parameters",
    ", the width of the atomic distribution around @xmath7 will be narrow compared to the spatial range of intensity variation of either light pulse and hence their interaction with the atoms is that of a standing wave with a time dependent strength .",
    "we assume that the atoms have initially a well defined momentum , @xmath8 , and we adiabatically eliminate the excited atomic state , which is off - resonance from the laser fields by an amount @xmath9 , yielding the schrdinger equation for the ground state wave function , @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12      neglecting the second order spatial derivative in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , it becomes solvable by straightforward integration @xcite .",
    "we replace the assumed smooth position dependence of the amplitude , @xmath13 , before the interaction with the laser field by a constant , arriving at the solution @xmath14 where we will assume real field amplitudes .",
    "physically , neglecting the kinetic energy operator amounts to making the dynamics local in position involving only a position dependent phase factor .",
    "assuming gaussian pulses , @xmath15 , the definite integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) can be evaluated at @xmath16 , i.e. , after the pulse , and the exponential function can be expanded in the following series , @xmath17 note that this expression bears resemblance to the raman - nath solution obtained with constant laser amplitudes @xcite .",
    "however , the specific gaussian shape and an exponential dependence on the duration parameter , @xmath18 , of the bessel - function argument highlights certain specific physical properties of the diffraction process with gaussian pulses . for all practical purposes ,",
    "the position argument , @xmath19 , is much smaller than the pulse length @xmath20 and the first exponential term inside the bessel - function will be replaced by unity in the following .",
    "an example of the results obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) for the momentum distribution , i.e. , the absolute value of the square of the bessel - functions evaluated for different diffraction orders , @xmath21 , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) as function of the final state momentum @xmath22 . note the figure does not show the time dependent diffraction , but the asymptotic momentum distribution after the pulse , for different values of the pulse duration @xmath18 .",
    "the bessel - functions with @xmath23 all vanish for vanishing arguments , and we see that both short ( @xmath24 ) and long ( @xmath25 ) pulses exclude diffraction to new momentum components . for short pulses of given strength ,",
    "the explanation is that there is simply no time to significantly diffract the atoms , and the nearly vanishing @xmath18 argument suppresses the higher order bessel functions . for longer pulses",
    "the result can be ascribed to the exponential factor inside the bessel - functions , which in turn reflects the lack of energy conservation in the diffraction process : in the rest frame of atoms moving at velocity @xmath26 , the photons in the counter - propagating light pulses are doppler - shifted in frequency , causing an apparent change of @xmath27 in the field energy per absorption - emission cycle involving both beams .",
    "this is a violation of energy conservation , permitted because we consider a process of finite duration @xmath18 .",
    "note that the process is suppressed by the exponential factor when the corresponding frequency mismatch exceeds @xmath28 , in support of our interpretation in terms of the energy - time heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "alternatively , the finite duration pulses may be thought of as ( gaussian ) frequency distributions of light , and absorptions and emissions involving photons from the counter - propagating pulses may conserve field energy in the frame moving at @xmath26 , if the photons involved are at frequency components shifted by the amount @xmath29 with respect to the field carrier frequency of the pulses .",
    "the field power at those frequencies is just given by the gaussian factor , appearing inside the bessel function arguments .",
    "after having presented the equation governing the diffraction within the raman - nath approximation , which does not take into account the energy difference between states with different momenta , it is natural to investigate if a simple modification of the final result may capture the characteristic features of the energy dispersion . to this purpose , we shall come back to our interpretation of the last exponential factor inside the bessel function in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) . in the previous section we argued that this quantity expresses the mean change of field energy @xmath27 per absorption emission cycle , experienced by the moving atom due to the dopper effect , and that it is appropriately measured relative to the frequency witdth of the light pulses due to their finite duration . for a gaussian pulse ,",
    "the frequency distribution is also gaussian , hence the gaussian dependence inside the bessel - function . taking into account that the different momentum states have different kinetic energies , it is thus natural to suggest to apply the same argument as above but taking into account the change of field energy _",
    "plus atomic kinetic energy_. in the frame moving at velocity @xmath26 the atom is initially at rest .",
    "scattering process into the @xmath21th diffraction order by absorption and simulated emission of @xmath21 photons propagating in opposite directions changes the field energy by an amount @xmath30 .",
    "simultaneously atoms acquire a finite momentum kick of @xmath31 in the moving frame , and hence their final kinetic energy is @xmath32 .",
    "the total energy defect per absorption - emission event is therefore @xmath33 .",
    "since the pulses have gaussian frequency widths proportional to @xmath34 , the atoms may interact with frequency components shifted by @xmath35 in order to conserve total ( field plus atomic kinetic ) energy .",
    "motivated by the above analysis we thus suggest to replace @xmath8 in the exponential inside the bessel - function in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) by @xmath36 .",
    "this modification leads to the expression , @xmath37 for different diffraction orders , @xmath21 .",

    "we do not claim that such alteration is an exact result or even a systematic expansion in any small parameter , and although it is physically meaningful it must be justified _ a posteriori _ , for instance by comparison with an exact calculation .",
    "such assessment will be made in the following section .",
    "in the preceding section we have derived two different analytical solutions , which we shall now compare to the exact numerical solution of the problem .",
    "the full schrdinger equation without omission of the second derivative term is amenable to numerical solution , and we have carried out such computations for a wide range of atomic and field parameters .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) fails for these parameters , deep into the channeling regime .",
    "however , it is clear that the validity of our analytical solution enters the previously unknown channeling territory .",
    "it is also worth noting that for the case of high intensity ( high @xmath58 value ) , demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , our expression maintains its validity for all pulse durations , @xmath18 , since the diffraction process itself is confined to relatively short times .",
    "we have presented an analytical solution to a problem of atomic diffraction from a pulsed time - dependent light grating for the so called raman - nath regime where the kinetic energy of the atoms participating in the diffraction process may be neglected .",
    "we have extended this approximation by including certain aspects of the kinetic energy in the diffraction process and we have proposed a phenomenological improvement to this solution which is based on physically motivated arguments . through a comparison with an exact numerical solution of the schrdinger equation , it is shown that our modification extends the validity regime of the parameter space of the analytical solution from the raman - nath into the channeling regime .",
    "qualitatively the modification predicts the asymmetry due to the doppler effect in the diffraction pattern .",
    "the proposed analytical formula is compared with available numerical results and is found to be in good agreement even fairly deep in the channeling regime of strong and long interactions .",
    "although , containing certain elements of bragg diffraction , the proposed equation is not , however , capable of predicting correctly the effective two - state rabi cycling between momentum states @xmath59 .",
    "exploration of the channeling regime from the bragg - formalism seems a promising avenue for attempts to provide good analytical expressions for atomic diffraction closer to the bragg regime . together with the present work",
