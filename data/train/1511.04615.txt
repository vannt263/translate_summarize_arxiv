    "our ability to probe and harness molecular chirality remains incomplete in many respects , however , and new techniques for chiral molecules are , therefore , highly sought after .",
    "the basic property of a chiral molecule that is probed in typical optical rotation experiments using fluid samples @xcite is the isotropic sum @xmath6 with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 components of the optical activity pseudotensor @xcite referred to molecule - fixed axes @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "the ability to determine orientated rather than isotropically averaged chiroptical information , in particular the individual , orientated components @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite is highly attractive , as these offer a wealth of information about molecular chirality that is only partially embodied by the isotropic sum ( [ isotropic sum ] ) . at present such information can only be obtained , however , using an orientated sample as in a crystalline phase @xcite .",
    "the preparation of such samples is not always feasible and even when it can be achieved , signatures of chirality are usually very difficult to distinguish from other effects , in particular those due to linear birefringence .",

    "this represents but one of many conceivable possibilities for the implementation of chiral rotational spectroscopy : the ideas introduced in  [ chiralrotationalspectroscopy ] and  [ chiralrotationalspectra ] have a generality reaching beyond the present discussions .",
    "the design certainly has its limitations , but should nevertheless permit high - precision measurements based upon @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for many types of molecule , be they chiral or achiral , as well as measurements based upon @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for some types of chiral molecule under favourable circumstances .",
    "+   +    the key components of the spectrometer are depicted in fig .",
    "[ crsprot ] ( a ) , with an expanded view of the active region in fig .",
    "[ crsprot ] ( b ) .",
    "we summarise their functionality as follows . a quantitative model of the spectrometer",
    "is given in appendix d.    1 .   a pulsed supersonic expansion nozzle together with a collimation stage",
    "is employed to generate narrow pulses of internally cold chiral molecules with unimpeded rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "a nozzle of the piezoelectric variety permits a high rate of measurement @xcite .",
    "the collimation stage might include a skimmer augmented by an aperture @xcite .",
    "an optical cavity houses far off - resonance visible or perhaps near infrared circularly polarised light of moderate intensity , to shift the rotational energies of the molecules in a chirally sensitive manner .",
    "fine - tuning the polarisation properties of the light in the active region enables the refinement of magic transitions , to help overcome stringent requirements on the intensity of the light and thus obtain a clean chiral rotational spectrum .",
    "the optical cavity might be of the skew - square ring variety , comprised of low - loss , ultra - high - reflectivity , low - anisotropy mirrors @xcite whilst the light might originate from an external cavity diode laser , the output of which is fibre amplified and mode matched into the ring with stability actively enforced @xcite .",
    "3 .   a microwave cavity and associated components generate and detect microwaves as in the well - established technique of cavity enhanced fourier transform microwave spectroscopy @xcite but here with the aim of measuring chirally sensitive distortions of the rotational spectrum of the molecules due to the light .",
    "the microwave cavity might be of the fabry - prot variety , comprised of spherical mirrors with microwaves coupled in and out of the microwave cavity via waveguide or perhaps via antennas @xcite .",
    "4 .   an evacuated chamber encompasses the key components described above to eliminate atmospheric interference with the molecular pulses and facilitate the removal of molecules between measurements .",
    "the absence of air , dust and other such influences should assist moreover in maintaining the stability of the optical cavity @xcite .",
    "5 .   a static magnetic field of moderate strength and high uniformity defines a quantisation axis parallel to that defined by the direction of propagation of the light in the active region whilst enabling additional refinement of magic transitions if necessary .",
    "the static magnetic field might be produced by a pair of superconducting helmholtz coils @xcite or perhaps even an appropriate arrangement of permanent magnets with some degree of tunability .",
    "note that the static magnetic field plays no direct role in probing the chirality of the molecules .",
    "its influence is discussed in more detail in appendix b.    a chiral rotational spectrum is recorded as the average of many measurements , each of which proceeds as follows .",
    "the nozzle is opened at some initial time , allowing a molecular pulse to begin expanding towards the active region . in the initial stage of this expansion",
    "the internal temperature of the molecules decreases dramatically , as collisions convert enthalpy into directed translational energy .",
    "the molecules thus occupy their electronic and vibrational ground states and a small collection of rotational and nuclear - spin states , with their internal angular momenta preferentially quantised parallel to the static magnetic field . following this initial stage",
    "the molecules proceed largely collision free .",
    "a subset of the molecules selected by the collimation stage eventually permeate the light in the active region , which shifts their rotational energies in a chirally sensitive manner .",
    "when the overlap between the molecules , the light and the microwave mode is optimum a microwave pulse permeates the microwave cavity and induces coherence in those ( light - shifted ) rotational transitions that lie near the chosen microwave cavity frequency and within the microwave cavity frequency bandwidth .",
    "the molecules then radiate back into the microwave cavity over a longer time , with the signal diminishing primarily as a result of residual collisions .",
    "this free induction decay signal is monitored and the real part of its fourier transform , say , calculated and regarded as the measurement .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio demands explicit discussion as the number of molecules contributing to a measurement is small .",
    "this is due primarily to the collimation stage , which is required as molecules removed from the light contribute nothing to the signals of interest here and in fact threaten to obscure them .",
    "the exact signal - to - noise ratio attained will depend , of course , upon the quality of the components used and the care with which the spectrometer is built and measurements are taken , as well as the nature of the sample and the rotational line under consideration .",
    "we can nevertheless give some idea here of what should be possible by recalling for example that a comparable standard cavity enhanced fourier transform microwave spectrometer gave a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath102s@xmath103 with @xmath104 the total recording time for a measurement rate of @xmath105s@xmath77 of the @xmath106 transition in the @xmath107o@xmath89c@xmath108s molecules that exist with a natural abundance of @xmath109 in a sample of @xmath92 ocs seeded in an @xmath110 ne : he carrier gas @xcite .",
    "simple estimates then suggest that similar signal - to - noise ratios should be attainable by a chiral rotational spectrometer using suitably pure ( although not necessarily enantiomerically pure ) samples under appropriate operating conditions .",
    "there is in an obvious opportunity for improvement here moreover .",
    "the rate at which measurements are taken in a standard cavity enhanced fourier transform microwave spectrometer is limited physically by the time taken to evacuate molecules between successive measurements @xcite . in a chiral rotational spectrometer measurements might be taken instead at an increased rate , perhaps up to @xmath111s@xmath77 @xcite , owing to the smaller number of molecules present .",
    "this is approaching continuous operation of the nozzle , with measurements made around once every ten free induction decay times to give an order of magnitude improvement in the signal - to - noise ratio , assuming a square root improvement with the number of measurements taken .",
    "it appears then that a recording time of a few hours could yield a very agreeable chiral rotational spectrum in many cases .",
    "this is approaching the time usually taken to record a complete standard rotational spectrum @xcite , but here with the effort focused entirely upon a single rotational line .",
    "this is acceptable as four spectra spread over two lines for opposite circular polarisations might already permit the extraction of all of the chirally sensitive information on offer here for a particular enantiomer .",
    "we are reminded of early raman optical activity spectrometers , which demanded recording times of several hours @xcite .",
    "even now , `` _ _ traditional chiroptical spectroscopy techniques take minutes to hours _ _ ''",
    "chiral microwave three wave mixing in contrast exhibits an excellent signal - to - noise ratio , with measurement times `` _ _ as fast as tens of seconds _",
    "_ '' having been claimed in one of the earliest publications @xcite .    a linearly polarised standing wave of light with a significantly lower intensity , housed simply in a two - mirror optical cavity perhaps , might already suffice if measurements based upon @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for either chiral or achiral molecules , are all that is sought .",
    "in the present section we highlight an interesting implication of our work for astronomy and the quest to understand the origins of life .",
    "the discovery in meteorites of excesses of l - amino acids over d - amino acids @xcite echoing the preference exhibited by living things for l - amino acids over d - amino acids @xcite is regarded by some as indirect evidence that biological homochirality and indeed life itself are of cosmic origin .",
    "a wealth of hypotheses have been put forward in this context , including the idea that biological homochirality began in space with the illumination of molecules by circularly polarised light of extraterrestrial origin @xcite .",
    "direct evidence remains lacking , however , in that `` _ _ no chiral molecule has been identified in the interstellar medium _ _ '' as of 2014 @xcite . in any case , the observed meteoric enantiomeric excesses demand explanation .",
    "+    rotational spectroscopy has already proven itself useful in astronomy , having enabled the identification of a modest collection of simple molecular species in space @xcite .",
    "the principles underpinning chiral rotational spectroscopy might be exploited to bolster the search for chiral species in particular .",
    "our idea , depicted in fig .",
    "[ chiralastronomy ] , is to train a telescope on a region where chiral molecules and intense circularly polarised light are believed to exist simultaneously @xcite and search the spectrum obtained for signatures of molecular chirality analogous to those that we envisage exploiting in chiral rotational spectroscopy .",
    "one particular scenario that we are currently investigating is that of a `` _ _ chance encounter _ _ ''",
    "@xcite between chiral molecules in a molecular cloud and radiation from a ` polar ' : a strongly magnetic white dwarf rotating synchronously with and accreting from a low mass companion @xcite .",
    "circumstances are conceivable in which the molecules in the cloud are shielded by dust @xcite and even geometrical effects @xcite from potentially damaging high - frequency radiation @xcite whilst nevertheless being illuminated by far off - resonance visible and near infrared cyclotron radiation from the polar of appreciable intensity @xcite and with a considerable degree of circular polarisation @xcite",
    ". meanwhile , radiowave radiation from the polar might be rather quiet @xcite , thus facilitating measurement of the rotational spectrum of the molecules in the cloud with little interference .",
    "the influence had upon the rotational spectrum by the cyclotron radiation should vary in accord with variation in the polar as seen by photometry and photopolarimetry measurements , which might aid in its identification . in particular , a variation of the rotational spectrum with the sense of handedness of the cyclotron radiation , all other things being equal or else accounted for , may already suffice to reveal the chirality of the chiral molecules , even if the rotational spectrum is otherwise difficult to interpret .",
    "the successful exploitation of even one chance scenario like this to detect chiral molecules in space would constitute a significant development .",
    "many questions remain here , not least those regarding the signals of use that might be obtained using currently existing technology .",
    "this depends in particular upon the number of chiral molecules present , which is in general an unknown .",
    "indeed , determining the deviation of this number from zero is the point of the exercise .",
    "we are unaware of any astronomical scenarios in which the prerequisites for chiral microwave three wave mixing might be found .",
    "in the present paper we have introduced chiral rotational spectroscopy : a new technique for chiral molecules that combines the chiral sensitivity inherent to natural optical activity with the orientational sensitivity and high precision inherent to standard rotational spectroscopy .",
    "chiral rotational spectroscopy enables the determination of the orientated optical activity pseudotensor components @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 of chiral molecules , in a manner that reveals the enantiomeric constitution of a sample and provides an incisive signal even for a racemate",
    ". it could find use in the analysis of molecules that are chiral solely by virtue of their isotopic constitution , molecules with multiple chiral centres and more besides .",
    "there is much to be done : our formalism and calculations can and should be refined ; the nature of the information offered by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 requires further attention ; the use of our proposed technique to determine other polarisability components remains to be explored in more detail ; designs for chiral rotational spectrometers and their functionality demand further investigation ; the implications for astronomy and the quest to understand the origins of life seem worthy of pursuit .",
    "we will return to these and related tasks elsewhere .",

    "we begin by considering @xmath124 in isolation .",

    "this procedure can be performed analytically . for higher values of @xmath45 the @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 blocks",

    "the independence upon the sign of @xmath130 indicated here leaves a @xmath141 rotational degeneracy , of course , and may be appreciated by noting that a parity inversion of the system changes the sign of the component of the molecule s angular momentum along the direction of propagation of the light whilst leaving the energy of the system unchanged .",
    "the absence at this order of certain components such as @xmath142 may be appreciated by noting that these are not uniquely defined in the present context : a rotation of the molecular axes by @xmath143 about the original @xmath7 axis without changing the molecule leaves @xmath124 unaffected whilst nevertheless changing the sign of @xmath142 , for example .",
    "it is tedious but straightforward to evaluate the matrix elements appearing in ( [ mf1 ] ) , ( [ mf2 ] ) and ( [ mf3 ] ) , by performing angular integrations over direction cosines and symmetric rotor wavefunctions explicitly @xcite or by multiplying well - established expressions for direction cosine matrix elements in the symmetric rotor basis perhaps @xcite . we refrain from reproducing here the somewhat lengthy expressions thus obtained .",

    "we refrain , therefore , from including them explicitly in the present paper .",
    "their presence is indicated in  [ chiralrotationalspectroscopy ] by dots and is neglected in  [ chiralrotationalspectra ] .",
    "finally , we consider the additional perturbation of @xmath145 by @xmath28 to first order .",
    "let us introduce here the nuclear - spin states @xmath146 , with @xmath147 determining the magnitude of the spin and @xmath148 determining the @xmath12 component of the spin for the @xmath149th nucleus @xcite .",
    "our approach is to consider each distinct value of @xmath150 in turn and diagonalise the matrix with elements of the form @xmath151 the energy shifts thus obtained give rise in particular to hyperfine structure in the rotational spectrum of the molecule in the presence of the light .",
    "the leading - order perturbative results described above suffice to illustrate the basic features of chiral rotational spectroscopy and are the ones upon which we base our explicit discussions and calculations in the present paper .",
    "we note here , however , that near degeneracies of importance are , in fact , rather common . in general then , @xmath68 should be diagonalised numerically .",
    "in the present appendix we briefly discuss the influence of an applied static magnetic field .",
    "we consider the situation described by @xmath68 as in appendix a but augmented here by a uniform , static magnetic field @xmath152 of moderate strength pointing in the @xmath12 direction .",

    "indeed , the contribution made to @xmath168 by the @xmath165 is to magnetic or faraday optical rotation and the spin of light what the contribution made by the @xmath54 is to natural optical rotation and the helicity of light @xcite .",
    "we begin by considering the perturbation of @xmath124 by @xmath172 to first order .",
    "the nuclear - spin degeneracy is at least partially broken by @xmath173 , as @xmath174 with nuclear - spin degeneracies remaining when multiple nuclei of the same type with spins of @xmath56 are present , which will usually be the case .",

    "in the present appendix we give a quantitative model of the chiral rotational spectrometer discussed in  [ chiralrotationalspectrometer ] .",
    "our derivation borrows heavily from @xcite .",

    "we consider a single form of molecule , taking @xmath196 to coincide with the onset of a polarising microwave pulse for a particular measurement .",
    "the spectrum for a mixture follows then as the sum of the spectra attributable to the different molecular forms present .",
    "we place the origin of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 at the centre of the microwave cavity , with the @xmath11 axis parallel to the axis of the microwave cavity and the direction of propagation of the light in the active region defining the @xmath19 direction . in addition",

    "the helmholtz coils are centred upon @xmath201 where they produce a static magnetic field in the @xmath12 direction .",

    "stray fields and radiation , including the earth s gravitational and magnetic fields and background blackbody radiation , are neglected , as is noise .",
    "a number of possible interactions , including the formation of clusters and other such complications within the molecular pulses , adhesion of the molecules to the light mirrors , changes in the resonant frequencies of the optical cavity due to heating by the light or refraction by the molecules and perturbation of the operation of the microwave cavity by the light mirrors , are neglected .",
