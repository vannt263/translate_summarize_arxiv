    "the local galaxy population presents a clear bimodality in many different properties : blue galaxies with active star formation and late - type morphologies vs red , quiescent galaxies with early - type morphologies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this bimodality is ubiquitous , extending from galaxy clusters to groups and to the general field @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of this bimodality remains one of the most puzzling questions of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "is the difference of the two distinct populations seeded in the early stages of galaxy formation ( the so - called nature  scenario ) , or is it the end result of a transformation driven by environment ( the nurture  scenario ) ?",
    "strong evidence favoring the nurture scenario comes from the drastic change of the fraction of galaxies in these two populations in different environments : the fraction of passive galaxies increases with increasing galaxy density .",
    "however , such a correlation alone does not directly imply a nurture scenario .",
    "the fraction of galaxies in different populations also depends on galaxy stellar mass @xcite , which could have a different distribution in low- and high - density regions seeded at the time of galaxy formation .",
    "hence , to fully understand galaxy evolution , we need to disentangle the stellar - mass and environment dependence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and identify the mechanisms responsible for establishing the bimodality in galaxy properties .",
    "galaxy groups , as the most common galaxy associations , contain about 50% of the galaxy population at the present day @xcite .",
    "the characteristic depth of the potential wells of groups is similar to those of individual galaxies , and the velocities of galaxies within groups are only a few hundred @xmath6 , comparable to the internal velocity of galaxies . under these circumstances , galaxies interact strongly with one another , and with the group as a whole . such interactions could transform the morphology of galaxies , induce starbursts , and thereby turn active , late - type galaxies into quiescent , early - type galaxies .",
    "in addition , the group environment could also transform galaxies via ram pressure stripping of their hot gas halos , eventually suffocating star formation @xcite .",
    "hence , not only are groups the most common environmental phase experienced by galaxies during their evolution , they also have the potential to strongly affect large populations of galaxies and thereby help to explain the ubiquitous bimodality in galaxy properties .",
    "another important implication of galaxy transformations in groups is the pre - processing of galaxies before they fall into clusters @xcite . in a hierarchical structure formation scenario ,",
    "clusters are built up by the accretion of smaller structures , e.g. , isolated galaxies and groups .",
    "however , it is still under debate if the majority of cluster galaxies were ever located in groups before being acquired by clusters @xcite .",
    "if the fraction of cluster galaxies accreted in groups is substantial , preprocessing of galaxy properties by the group environment could play a major role in forming the predominantly passive population in clusters .",
    "additional physical mechanisms which only work efficiently in the cluster environment , such as galaxy harassment and ram pressure stripping of cold galactic gas , could further affect galaxy properties but would possibly only be of secondary importance .    despite the importance of the group environment for the global galaxy population ,",
    "our understanding of groups is still very limited .",
    "there have been many studies of group galaxies trying to address these questions . due to the low galaxy density contrast against the field , many previous group studies focused on x - ray luminous groups , which are mostly virialized groups @xcite",
    ". however , when referring to the majority of galaxies as being located in groups , this applies specifically to _ optically _ selected groups , typically identified through a friends - of - friendsanalysis of galaxy redshift survey data @xcite .",
    "such groups span a wide range of evolutionary states , including systems in the process of collapsing ( like the local group ) , systems in the throes of strong galaxy interactions or subgroup mergers , and fully virialized systems . to fully assess the importance of the group environment on galaxy evolution , complete samples of galaxy groups extending to poor systems are essential . there have also been studies of optically selected groups based on large - area galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "however , due to the limited survey depth , many of the poor groups in those studies only contain a handful of known group members .",
    "to fully understand the dynamics and galaxy content of each group , we need to probe to significantly fainter optical magnitudes than is usually possible with such large surveys .    for this purpose ,",
    "we have started the xmm - imacs ( xi ) groups project ( @xcite ; hereafter paper  i ) to carry out a multi - wavelength study of a statistically representative nearby group sample .",
    "we selected 25 groups with velocity dispersion @xmath7 @xmath6  from the group catalog of @xcite , which was carefully derived from a friends - of - friends analysis of the 2df redshift survey @xcite .",
    "the groups are selected in a narrow redshift range ( @xmath8 ) to minimize the redshift dependence of group properties . to fully represent the poor group population , the xi group sample was selected to span a wide range in group properties , e.g. , velocity dispersion , virial radius , and number of group members @xcite . to extract membership information down to faint magnitudes ,",
    "multislit spectroscopy of these groups has been performed using imacs on the 6.5-m baade / magellan telescope @xcite , and for nine of the groups we have also obtained x - ray observations using _ xmm - newton_. at the chosen group redshifts , the fields of view of both imacs and _ xmm - newton _ cover the typical virial radius of the groups , @xmath9  1  mpc .    to assess the star formation properties of galaxies in these groups",
    ", we carried out _ spitzer _ mips 24  imaging of the xi group sample .",
    "different from emission line or uv luminosity often used in previous group studies to measure the star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies , the mid - ir emission from the dust heated by a young stellar population is a robust star formation indicator unaffected by extinction .",
    "thus , ir emission is not only critical in giving us an unbiased view of the star formation properties of the group population , but more importantly , is essential to identify dusty starbursts in which the majority of the star formation is obscured and not seen in optical spectra @xcite .",
    "although there have been many studies of star - forming ( sf ) galaxies using ir observations in clusters @xcite , such studies of groups have been lacking .",
    "while @xcite detected an excess of 24  sf galaxies in groups compared to the field , we note that their sample represents a somewhat peculiar case of a super - group in the process of forming a massive cluster .    in this paper",
    ", we present the first ir study of star formation in a representative , nearby sample of groups , based on nine groups in our xi sample .",
    "these are the first nine groups for which we have complete spectroscopic data and x - ray observations .",
    "we analyze the star forming properties of group galaxies from their 24  emission and compare them to those of field and cluster galaxies . in section  [ sec , obs ] , we describe the observations and data reduction , and in section  [ sec , general ] discuss the general properties of the groups . in section  [ sec ,",
    "results ] , we present the sf galaxy fractions and specific sfrs of group galaxies , and compare them to results for galaxies in clusters and the field .",

    "source extraction and photometry were done with sextractor @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction using the dust map from @xcite .",
    "follow - up multi - object spectroscopy of galaxies in the group fields was obtained with the imacs spectrograph on the baade / magellan telescope .",
    "the spectra were taken with the 300  lines  mm@xmath12 prism on the f/2 camera , which covers a wavelength range of 390010000    at a dispersion of 1.34    pixel@xmath12 .",
    "spectroscopic targets were selected based on @xmath13-band magnitudes , prioritizing the brighter sources .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the cosmos software package .",
    "we refer readers to paper  i for more details on the target selection , observing strategy , and data reduction .",
    "the redshifts of the galaxies were determined by cross - correlating with sdss galaxy templates .",
    "typical errors in the redshift measurements were @xmath14  @xmath6 .    in most group fields , our optical imaging and",
    "spectroscopy only cover the central @xmath15 region , which corresponds to @xmath16  mpc@xmath17 at the relevant redshifts . to extend the spatial coverage to larger radii and better match the larger extent of the ir data , our spectroscopic data were complemented with redshift measurements from ned and the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs , * ? ? ?",
    "most of the redshift measurements in ned are from 2dfgrs , which probes down to a magnitude limit of @xmath18 , while the 6dfgs extends down to @xmath19 . some of those galaxies are outside the region covered by our imaging data . for these galaxies , we obtained @xmath13-band magnitudes from the supercosmos sky surveys ( sss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are , where they overlap , consistent with the photometry derived from our imaging data .",
    "our final spectroscopic catalogs are @xmath20 complete down to @xmath21 in the central @xmath22 ( 0.7 mpc ) region and @xmath23 complete out to a radius of @xmath24 ( 1.7 mpc ) .",
    "all nine groups discussed in this paper were observed by _ xmm - newton_. the details of the x - ray observations and analysis can be found in paper  i and @xcite .",
    "the nominal exposure time in all fields is @xmath25  ks , although the useful exposure time varies due to the presence of background flares in several of the observations .",
    "the typical detection limit for x - ray point sources is @xmath26  erg  s@xmath12 ( 0.32  kev ) , assuming a power - law spectrum of photon index of 1.7 subject to galactic absorption .",
    "extended emission from a hot intragroup medium is clearly detected in three groups , mz10451 , mz4577 , and mz9014 .",

    "a more detailed analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the 24  images of the groups were taken by mips @xcite on _ spitzer _ in the medium scan map mode during 20072008 .",
    "the observed field for each group was a rectangular region about @xmath29 ( @xmath30 mpc@xmath17 ) in size centered at the group center from the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mz ) catalog .",
    "the data were processed with the mips data analysis tool ( dat version 3.02 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and array - averaged background subtraction was applied to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the final mosaics have an exposure time of @xmath31  sec  pixel@xmath12 and a spatial resolution of @xmath32 .",
    "we used sextractor to extract sources and measure their 24  flux within an adaptive kron aperture ( flux_auto ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the data varies slightly from field to field depending on the ir background level , but the 3-@xmath33 point source detection limit is @xmath34  0.35  mjy in all fields .",
    "we correlated galaxies with the nearest 24  sources projected within @xmath35 .",
    "this matching radius takes into consideration the possible physical displacement between the optical and 24 brightness centroids . to determine the sfr from the 24  flux , we use the conversion given by @xcite",
    "however , the ir luminosity limit of our data , log@xmath36 , is fainter than the lower limit to which this formula is applicable ( log@xmath37 ) . for galaxies with lower ir luminosity , the ratio of escaping uv photons to uv photons absorbed by dust increases @xcite . at log@xmath38 ,",
    "the average leakage is only about 2.5% , and this is the correction factor adopted by @xcite in the derivation of their conversion formula .",
    "however , for less luminous galaxies , this correction is insufficient , as the average leakage increases to about 50% at log@xmath39 @xcite . to extend the sfr conversion to less luminous galaxies ( log@xmath40 ) , instead of using an average leakage fraction of 2.5%",
    ", we estimate the leakage as a function of @xmath41 using the average @xmath42 vs. @xmath43 relation provided by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 7 ) , where @xmath44 .",
    "we then correct the sfr derived from rieke s formula with this leakage fraction .",
    "this correction is generally small , increasing the derived sfr at most by a factor of 2 , and it only affects galaxies with low sfrs . with this conversion ,",
    "the 24  detection limit of our observations translates into an sfr limit of 0.1  @xmath45 .    in this work , we assume that the 24  emission of galaxies is predominantly from dust heated by young stars .",
    "this is true for star - forming galaxies and hii regions , based on which the 24  to sfr conversion is calibrated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , for galaxies with small 24  luminosities , especially early - type galaxies , the contribution from cold dust heated by an evolved stellar population becomes significant .",
    "@xcite have shown that for elliptical galaxies there is a correlation between 24  luminosity and the near - ir luminosity @xmath46 , consistent with the expectation of mid - ir emission originating from cold dust surrounding the old , mass - losing red - giant stars . with this correlation , we can estimate the cold dust contribution to the 24  emission from @xmath46 . to do so",
    ", we retrieved @xmath47 band luminosities of our group galaxies from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , which is complete down to @xmath48 at the group redshift .",
    "for group galaxies too faint to be detected by 2mass , we estimate their @xmath47 luminosity from @xmath13 magnitudes .",
    "this introduces an extra uncertainty in our estimates , but for these less massive galaxies , the cold dust contribution is generally minimal compared to the 24  detection limit to which we are sensitive .",
    "following @xcite , we regard the 24  emission of all galaxies with log@xmath49 ( with @xmath50 in erg  s@xmath12 and @xmath46 in @xmath51 ) as coming exclusively from cold dust , setting their sfr to zero ; for galaxies above this limit , we subtract a cold dust contribution , log@xmath52log@xmath53 , from the observed @xmath50 before converting the latter into an sfr estimate .",
    "overall , this cold dust correction for our sample is very small : for the 24  detected galaxies in our groups , none has @xmath50 consistent with being from cold dust alone , and the majority has a cold dust contribution less than 10% .",
    "another complication of using mid - ir emission to derive sfr is the contamination from agn activity . in this case ,",
    "the dust is , at least partly , heated by agns and the correlation between sfrs and 24  flux no longer holds . to identify agn , we cross - match group members with the x - ray point sources detected in each field .",
    "using a matching radius of 10@xmath54 , we found unambiguous x - ray counterparts , with @xmath55  ergs  s@xmath12 , for five galaxies in the nine groups .",
    "if we only consider the galaxies with @xmath56 within the _ xmm _ field of view , the fraction of group galaxies with @xmath55  ergs  s@xmath12 is @xmath57% , consistent with the 5% found in clusters @xcite .",
    "of those five x - ray bright galaxies , only two are also detected at 24  .",
    "this only accounts for a small fraction ( @xmath58 ) of the ir - detected galaxies .",
    "this fraction is also consistent with the result found in the a901/902 supercluster @xcite .",
    "in addition to x - ray luminous agn , @xcite also identified five optical agn with no x - ray counterpart within our groups .",
    "all of these are bright at 24  .",
    "even though these galaxies show emission line ratios typical of agn , their ir emission is probably still dominated by star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of the difficulty in removing the agn contribution to the ir emission , and the small number of group galaxies with known agn signatures , we do not exclude these agn in our ir - selected sf galaxy sample . in the following sections , we compare our group sf galaxies to field and cluster sf galaxies and we note that these comparison samples of ir - selected sf galaxies may also be contaminated by agn .",
    "however , the inferred dependence of agn fraction on environment is generally weak @xcite .",
    "in particular , the results of @xcite show that , down to the limiting magnitude of @xmath59 that we consider for sf galaxies in sections  [ sec , results ] and [ sec , discuss ] , the overall agn fraction within our groups is consistent with that of rich clusters .",
    "hence , we do not expect environmental differences in agn activity to have a significant impact on our results .",
    "we further compiled a field galaxy sample from 23 xi group fields with mips data . for each field",
    ", we retrieved all the galaxies with redshifts from ned , where most of them are from the 2dfgrs survey .",
    "the redshift histogram of each field was examined to exclude foreground / background clusters and groups , resulting in a field sample of 77 galaxies in the redshift range of @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath13-band magnitudes of these galaxies were obtained from the 2dfgrs photometric catalog . among these field galaxies ,",
    "45 are brighter than @xmath61 .    for comparison , we also compiled a cluster galaxy sample from two local rich clusters : the coma cluster ( @xmath62 ) and the abell 3266 cluster ( a3266 , @xmath0 ) .",
    "both clusters have been observed with mips at 24  to similar depth as the xi groups .",
    "more details on the mips data of these two clusters are reported in @xcite .",
    "altogether , we have around 600 cluster galaxies with @xmath63 .",
    "we updated the 24  sfr conversion for these galaxies with the new method described in section  [ sec : sfr ] . compared to the group and field galaxies ,",
    "the cold dust correction is more important for cluster galaxies .",
    "about 20% of the cluster members have a cold dust contribution of more than 20% , and about 10% have a 24  flux consistent with being from cold dust alone .",
    "to select group members , we performed an iterative 3-@xmath33 clipping in redshift space using the bi - weight mean and dispersion @xcite until the number of group members converged . in most groups ,",
    "all galaxies with velocity @xmath64  km  s@xmath12 within the group mean and within 25@xmath65 ( @xmath9  1.7  mpc ) of the group centers were included in the calculation . for mz3849 and mz9307 ,",
    "narrower velocity ranges were employed ( 1300 and 1500  km  s@xmath12 , respectively ) , in order to exclude contamination from nearby unrelated structures . in all cases",
    ", the calculations converged in one or two iterations . in total , we identified 273 group members in the nine groups . with the new membership lists , we updated the group redshifts and velocity dispersions , as listed in table  [ tab_1 ] .",
    "the 1-@xmath33 errors on the velocity dispersions were derived from bootstrap calculations .",
    "the velocity dispersions of our group sample range from @xmath66500  @xmath6 .",
    "we also calculated the velocity dispersions using only galaxies within 1  mpc from the group centers , confirming that the differences in resulting velocity dispersions are well within the estimated errors .",
    "the galaxy velocity histogram in each field is plotted in figure  [ f_velhist ] in bins of 150  @xmath6 , with group members indicated by the shaded area . in all cases ,",
    "the group members form distinctive peaks in velocity space .",
    "several groups show multiple peaks , suggesting possible substructure .",
    "in particular , the two richest groups , mz10451 and mz5383 , both show two separate peaks . however , the projected galaxy distribution shows no obvious spatial segregation associated with these individual peaks to directly support the existence of substructure .",
    "recently , @xcite concluded that the anderson - darling ( a  d ) test is a reliable tool to detect departures from a gaussian velocity distribution in small data sets with size typical of our groups .",
    "because a non - gaussian velocity distribution could suggest an unrelaxed dynamical status , we performed the a ",
    "d test on our groups and found that the null - hypothesis of a gaussian distribution is rejected in the two richest groups at the 90% confidence level .",
    "this suggests that these two groups are not relaxed systems . for the rest of the groups , the a ",
    "d test does not reject the hypothesis of a gaussian distribution .",
    "however , the power of the a ",
    "d test decreases in poorer systems @xcite , and consistency with a gaussian velocity distribution need not imply a dynamically relaxed systems in such cases .      in figure  [ f_galdist ]",
    "we show the projected spatial distribution of the group members .",
    "each plot is @xmath67 in size , and the dotted rectangular region indicates the mips 24  coverage .",
    "it is clear from the plot that the galaxy distribution in several groups is rather irregular , with some of the groups showing evidence of substructure .",
    "rich systems such as mz10451 and mz5383 , tend to show clear concentrations in the galaxy distribution , whereas several of the poorer ones display a more filamentary overall morphology .",
    "however , the large uncertainty in determining the geometry of the galaxy distribution in poor systems renders such differentiation tentative at best .",
    "furthermore , even the richer systems show evidence of prominent subclumps and elongated structures .",
    "we defer a detailed morphological analysis to a future paper , when spectroscopic results for the full xi group sample are available",
    ".    to determine the group center , we first calculated the @xmath13-band luminosity - weighted center including all the group members .",
    "we then exclude galaxies with velocities more than 2@xmath33 away from the cluster mean or projected distance larger than 15 @xmath65 ( @xmath91 mpc ) from the initial group center and recalculate the luminosity - weighted center .",
    "we plot these centers as green plus signs in figure  [ f_galdist ] .",
    "we also overlay the luminosity - weighted galaxy surface density maps in the same plot . in many groups ,",
    "as shown in the plot , the luminosity - weighted group centers are quite far away from the peak of the luminosity - weighted density map . in the three groups with",
    "clearly detected extended x - ray emission , mz10451 , mz4577 and mz9014 , the x - ray centroids are located closer to the galaxy density peak ( @xmath68  kpc ) than to the luminosity - weighted group centers .",
    "these large displacements may suggest that these systems are still in the process of virialization . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use luminosity - weighted group centers as the group centers .",
    "however , we note that using luminosity - weighted galaxy density peaks ( or x - ray centroids , where available ) as the group centers do not change the general results in this paper .",
    "further evidence that many of these systems have not reached a fully virialized stage is the lack of a central brightest group galaxy ( bgg ) .",
    "nearby x - ray selected groups generally have early - type bggs sitting at the center of the group potential @xcite .",
    "in most of our groups , the brightest galaxies within 1 mpc of the luminosity - weighted group centers are located @xmath69  kpc away from the centers .",
    "also , as shown in figure  [ f_galdist ] , many of these bggs are not coincident with the most crowded region in the groups . in the most x - ray luminous group in the sample ,",
    "mz10451 , the galaxy residing at the center of the x - ray emission is only the fourth brightest galaxy in the group .",
    "the bgg lies about 700  kpc away from the luminosity - weighted center and is about 1.2  mpc away from the center of the x - ray emission , placing it beyond the virial radius according to the mass profile determined from our x - ray data @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has a radial velocity of @xmath70  @xmath6  relative to the group mean and is a spiral galaxy .",
    "these pieces of evidence strongly argue that this bgg is just a recently accreted galaxy .",
    "moreover , the distribution of most of the bright galaxies in these groups is fairly scattered instead of being centrally concentrated , also suggestive of the systems generally not being dynamically old .",
    "a statistical indicator of star formation activity in a galaxy population is the fraction of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the sensitivity of the 24  observations of the xi groups allows the detection of sf galaxies with sfr @xmath71 @xmath45 .",
    "we can therefore calculate the fraction of sf galaxies with sfr @xmath71 @xmath45  for all the galaxies brighter than @xmath59 .",
    "we limit the sf fraction calculation to galaxies with @xmath72 , because the comparison cluster and field samples discussed in the following sections are only complete down to this limit .",
    "however , for the group galaxies , we confirmed that extending the fraction calculation to a fainter magnitude ( @xmath73 ) lowers the overall fractions but does not change any of our conclusions .",
    "dwarf galaxies fainter than @xmath74 were excluded in the fraction calculations , due to incompleteness of our optical spectroscopy ( and , likely , of our 24  data ) at these magnitudes . since only group members within the region of 24  coverage are considered for fraction calculations , most galaxies at large radii are also excluded .",
    "we note that the following results remain unchanged if we limit the fraction calculations to the galaxies covered by mips within 1  mpc from the optical group centers .      in the top left panel of figure  [ f_frac_depend ] , we plot the star - forming galaxy fractions in the nine groups as a function of group velocity dispersion .",
    "most of the groups ( six out of nine ) show a high fraction ( @xmath23 ) of sf galaxies .",
    "two groups with @xmath75  @xmath6 , mz3849 and mz9014 , have smaller fractions of 43% and 33% , respectively .",
    "mz9307 is a peculiar case with zero fraction of star - forming galaxies : most of its members are dwarf galaxies with only two galaxies brighter than @xmath76 , and these are not star - forming , resulting in a sf fraction of zero with a large uncertainty .",
    "a spearman correlation test shows that there is an anti - correlation between sf fractions and velocity dispersion ( at a significance of @xmath77 ) , but this trend is mostly driven by the two groups with smallest @xmath33 ( @xmath78  @xmath6 ) and highest sf fractions .",
    "the significance of the anti - correlation drops to @xmath79 once these two groups are excluded .",
    "if the velocity dispersion of a group correlates well with the mass of the group , which is true for a virialized system , then the lack of clear trend in sf fractions with velocity dispersion suggests that the sf properties of these groups do not depend strongly on total group mass .",
    "however , as evidenced by their irregular galaxy distribution and the general lack of a central bgg , the groups in our sample are not likely to be virialized , and their velocity dispersion might be a poor indicator of their masses .",
    "an alternative proxy for the group mass is the integrated stellar mass of group members . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that the total stellar mass of group galaxies brighter than @xmath80 correlates tightly with total group mass . to derive the total stellar mass of the groups",
    ", we used @xmath13-band magnitudes , calibrating the stellar mass calculation using a subset of our group galaxies that have sdss 5-band photometric data .",
    "for those galaxies , we can deduce their stellar masses using the sed fitting methods proposed by @xcite .",
    "the resulting stellar masses correlate well with the @xmath13-band magnitudes , with a 1-@xmath33 scatter of 0.17 due to variations in stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we do not try to constrain the mass - to - light ratio using galaxy colors , because group galaxies outside our imaging region only have reliable @xmath13 magnitudes .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainty on stellar mass caused by such variations does not have a significant impact on the results in this paper .    using the inferred correlation , we deduced the stellar mass for group galaxies in the full sample . from the top right panel of figure  [ f_frac_depend ]",
    ", it is clear that there is no correlation between the sf fractions and the resulting total stellar mass of the groups .",
    "we also note that if we extend the sf fraction calculation to include galaxies one magnitude fainter ( @xmath81 ) , the sf fractions in all groups become smaller , but they still show no trend with velocity dispersion nor with total stellar mass . as a comparison , we also calculate the sf galaxy fraction for the field and cluster samples . in the field , this fraction is @xmath82 , about 30% higher than the mean sf fraction of all group galaxies ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the two groups with the smallest velocity dispersions ( @xmath84 @xmath6 ) have sf fractions consistent with the field average .",
    "the fraction in the cluster sample is @xmath85 , about 30% lower than the group average .",
    "we also note that the three groups with detectable extended x - ray emission do not show different sf fractions compared to those with no detection .",
    "although the detection limits of our x - ray observations are not uniform due to variations in the useful exposure time , the fact that mz10451 , the most x - ray luminous group with a luminosity typical of x - ray selected high-@xmath33 groups , has an sf fraction of @xmath86 , very similar to the average of our nine groups , argues against a significant correlation between sf fractions and the x - ray properties of our groups .",
    "the weak dependence of sf fractions on group global properties is consistent with results from other studies of nearby groups @xcite and groups at intermediate redshifts @xcite .",
    "this might be an indication that the sf properties of group galaxies are more affected by their immediate environment , e.g. , local galaxy density , rather than the global environment .",

    "for individual groups in our sample , there are too few galaxies to study this trend , so we stack all the groups together and plot the sf fraction against the projected distance from group luminosity - weighted centers in the middle panel of figure  [ f_frac ] .",
    "we note that not all annuli in this plot are uniformly covered by mips in all groups , but since only group members within the region of mips coverage are included in the fractions , partial coverage should not introduce systematic variations in the plot .",
    "in contrast to the rich clusters ( shown in the left panel of figure  [ f_frac ] ) , sf fractions in groups show no clear dependence on the distance from the group centers and remain at a level higher than the outer region of the rich clusters ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 is the radius within which the mean cluster density is 200 times the critical density of the universe at that redshift ) .",
    "using a larger bin size does not change this result .",
    "we note that the left panel of figure  [ f_frac ] is similar to figure  7 of @xcite , but with sfrs updated according to the prescription in section  [ sec : sfr ] . for our groups , some of which are likely not virialized",
    ", the virial radius is non - trivial to evaluate and may not be a meaningful measure , so we do not normalize the radii by @xmath88 before stacking the group results .",
    "the continuously decreasing sf fractions toward the cluster center could reflect a dependence of the sf properties on cluster properties that themselves depend on radius , such as local galaxy density or the density of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "if this is the case , the lack of a dependence of sf fractions on projected radius in groups could be a result of a breakdown of the correlation between galaxy density and projected distance rather than a breakdown of the correlation between sf fractions and galaxy density .",
    "the apparent displacements between the luminosity - weighted group centers and the galaxy density peaks seem to support this argument ( see figure  [ f_galdist ] ) . to check this possibility , we calculated the projected local galaxy density ( @xmath89 ) for all the group galaxies using the distance to the 2nd nearest neighbor ( @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 . after assigning a local density to each group galaxy",
    ", we calculate the sf fractions in four density bins for all the galaxies brighter than @xmath92 and within @xmath93 ( 0.7  mpc ) away from the group centers .",
    "the spectroscopic survey is less complete in the outer regions ( @xmath94 ) which could give rise to a systematically lower local density for galaxies at those radii .",
    "the density bins are selected to have roughly the same number of galaxies in each bin , and the highest density bin has density comparable to the value at 0.2@xmath88 of the clusters . in the right panel of figure  [ f_frac ] , we plot the sf fractions as a function of density .",
    "however , the sf fractions of all three high density bins remain approximately constant at a level higher than the fractions in the cluster .",
    "the lowest - density bin has a marginally significant higher sf fraction , and it is consistent with the average field value .",
    "this could be evidence of an anti - correlation between density and sf fractions , but the large uncertainties preclude robust conclusions in this regard ( 51% probability from a spearman test ) .",
    "[ s_ssfr ] in the previous section , we focused on the study of the total current sfr in a galaxy .",

    "the specific sfr , i.e.the total sfr normalized by the stellar mass of a galaxy , is a better measure of the relative importance of sf in different galaxies .",
    "because the stellar mass of a galaxy is the integral of the past sfr , the specific sfr , to first order , is also a measure of star formation history .",
    "many studies @xcite have indicated that the specific sfr depends primarily on galaxy mass , with any environmental dependence being of secondary importance . to disentangle the environmental dependence from the mass dependence , we derived the specific sfrs of our group galaxies and compared them to those of cluster and field galaxies .    in figure  [ f_ssfr ]",

    "the modes of our field sample , although subject to large uncertainties due to the small sample size , generally follow the sf sequence found by @xcite , but are systematically lower by 0.3  dex",
    ". part of this difference comes from the systematic difference in sfr estimates ( @xmath4  dex ) .",
    "this systematic difference is not significant though , given the intrinsic scatter in specific sfr along the star - forming sequence ( 0.5 dex , * ? ? ? * ) and the scatter in the correlation between the uv- and ir - inferred sfrs . at @xmath100 ,",
    "the sf galaxies in clusters , groups , and the field occupy similar regions in the plot and do not show any significant difference in their distribution .",
    "however , in this mass range , the 24  sensitivity limits us from detecting sf galaxies with relatively low specific sfrs .",
    "the similarity therefore only shows that the upper envelope of the specific sfr vs.  stellar mass distribution is broadly similar in all environments within this mass range . however , it is not clear whether there is a different distribution for sf galaxies below our detection limit . at @xmath101 ,",
    "the typical specific sfrs of the xi group galaxies are still very similar to those of the field . however , the cluster sf galaxies show much lower typical specific sfrs compared to group and field galaxies of similar mass .",

    "the sf fraction in clusters is comparable to that in the groups .",
    "however , it is clear from figure  [ f_ssfr ] that the typical specific sfr of cluster galaxies in this mass range is lower than the value of the group and field galaxies ; definining sf galaxies using a fixed sfr limit for galaxies of differing mass clearly fails to distinguish these different populations of sf galaxies . to take this mass dependence of the specific sfrs into account",
    ", we assume that the typical specific sfr of field galaxies is the value for a galaxy unaffected by its environment , and define healthy  sf galaxies as galaxies with specific sfr at least 20% of the typical value of field sf galaxies of the same mass , as found by @xcite .",
    "if we take into consideration the systematic difference between the sf sequences obtained from our field sample and from the sdss sf galaxy sample with uv data , and assume that the average scatter in the sf sequence is the same as that of the sdss sf galaxies of @xcite , then 75% of the sf galaxies in our field sample should have specific sfrs above this limit . in the bottom panel of figure  [ f_frac_mass ] , we show the healthy sf galaxy fractions as a function of stellar mass . in the three high - mass bins , where we are sensitive to all the healthy sf galaxies , the fractions in our field sample",
    "are all above 60% and generally consistent with the 75% from the above expectation .",

    "the fractions remain very low in all mass bins , 10 - 20% .",
    "although the sf fraction in clusters is about 40% at @xmath108 , almost as high as that in groups , the healthy sf fraction is only 20% , much lower than that in groups .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ f_ssfr ] and figure  [ f_frac_mass ] that using a fixed sfr cut to define sf galaxies and assess the sf properties in different environments may not be able to differentiate massive galaxies with lower than typical sfr from low - mass normal sf galaxies .",
    "therefore , we repeat the analysis of section  [ sec , sf_frac ] by calculating the healthy sf galaxy fraction for each group .",
    "we limit the calculation to galaxies with @xmath2 , which corresponds to the @xmath92 magnitude cut used for calculating the sf fractions . above this limit ,",

    "@xcite divide galaxies into early - type and late - type galaxies , based on criteria very similar to what we use to define healthy sf galaxies , but they found that the fraction of early - type galaxies in groups increases with group halo mass . specifically , they define early - type galaxies as both red in color and `` passive '' in terms of their star forming properties . because only 1% of their group population is blue and `` passive '' , the early - type galaxies are approximately equivalent to passive galaxies .",
    "they adopt a mass - dependent specific sfr cut to divide passive and active galaxies , which is very similar to our criteria for healthy sf galaxies ( shown as the grey dashed line in figure  [ f_ssfr ] ) .",
    "to directly compare with their results , we use the same sfr criteria to define passive galaxies in our group sample and calculate the passive galaxy fractions for galaxies with @xmath112 , equivalent to the magnitude cut of @xcite . in figure",
    "[ f_frac_et ] , we show this fraction as a function of group velocity dispersion . again ,",
    "similar to what we find in terms of healthy sf fractions , the fractions of passive galaxies in our group sample do not show any strong trend with velocity dispersion .",
    "a spearman test shows that the probability of correlation is only 25% .",
    "this apparent discrepancy could be due to small number statistics owing to the limited size of our group sample .",
    "in fact , within the rather large statistical uncertainties , the majority of our nine groups do show fractions consistent with the mean trends found by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the discrepancy could arise partly from differences in the adopted group definitions .",
    "@xcite select groups using a halo - based group finder @xcite while the mz sample is based on a friends - of - friends algorithm .",
    "the halo - based group finder assumes that groups are virialized systems , but this assumption is unlikely to hold in general for the groups in our sample , where some systems are probably still in the process of collapsing and so are not yet fully virialized .    finally , we also examined the healthy sf fractions as a function of radius from the group centers and the local projected galaxy density .",
    "these fractions are shown as grey squares in figure  [ f_frac ] .",
    "although the healthy sf fractions in all environments are lower than the `` standard '' sf fractions , the general results obtained earlier remain unchanged : there is no systematic dependence of healthy sf fractions on the distance from the group centers .",
    "although there might be a weak anti - correlation between healthy sf fractions and projected galaxy density .",
    "the healthy sf fractions of groups are higher in all density bins than the fractions seen in the outskirts of clusters .",
    "as mentioned , the current specific sfr of a galaxy provides a rough measure of its star formation history .",
    "the specific sfr can be directly related to the birthrate , which is defined as the current sfr normalized by its past average .",
    "given a gas recycling fraction @xmath13 and stellar age @xmath113 , the birthrate @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath115 and the age of the universe at @xmath0 as an upper limit to @xmath113 @xcite , we can calculate the upper limit of the birthrate for group galaxies . as shown in figure  [ f_ssfr ] , most of the sf group galaxies with @xmath116 have @xmath117 , indicating they are forming stars more or less at the same rate as the past average .",
    "if we define galaxies with current sfrs three times larger than the past average as starburst galaxies @xcite , only one group galaxy fulfills this criterion . for more massive group galaxies ,",
    "their current sfrs are generally lower than their past average , consistent with the trend for field galaxies . in clusters , there is a relatively large number of sf galaxies with current sfr significantly lower than their past average .",
    "on average , the sf fraction in our group sample is 30% lower than that in the field .",
    "even though this deficit of sf galaxies may be minimal in the least massive systems and the lowest density regions , it prevails in the typical environment of our group population .",
    "this result is consistent with the higher fraction of passive galaxies found in many different group samples at different redshift ranges compared to the field @xcite . on the other hand , when compared to the clusters a3266 and coma , the sf fraction in groups is generally @xmath118 higher .",
    "the decreasing sf fractions in more massive structures could suggest an environmental effect , but it does not directly imply an environmental suppression of the galaxy sf .",
    "many studies have shown that massive galaxies formed their stars early on in a short time period while less massive galaxies evolved more gradually ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the stellar mass is probably the most important variable that regulates the star formation history of a galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if galaxy clusters and groups , which originated from the highest density perturbations in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe , also preferentially host more massive galaxies @xcite , then the observed difference in the sf properties between high- and low - density environments was seeded at the beginning of the universe .",
    "this is considered to be the `` nature '' scenario of galaxy evolution .",
    "however , the fact that the healthy sf galaxy fractions , which by definition already take into account the stellar mass dependence of the sf properties , also show an increasing deficit in denser environments which persists across a large stellar mass range , suggests this scenario can not fully explain those differences and that some additional `` nurture '' process that invokes environmental effects is needed @xcite .      even though the group galaxies have , on average , a much lower sf fraction than the field , the typical specific sfrs of group sf galaxies are not very different from those of field galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "similar to our result , @xcite also found the specifc sfrs of group and field galaxies of intermediate redshift ( @xmath119 ) are not very different .",
    "therefore , if the much lower sf fractions in groups is caused by some environmental mechanism , the transformation needs to happen on a short time scale .",
    "such a mechanism should quickly turn normal sf galaxies into quiescent ones without affecting the overall typical specific sfrs too much .",
    "galaxy - galaxy interactions appear to be a likely candidate for this mechanism .",
    "these interactions can trigger starbursts in galaxies and cause them to exhaust their gas fuel quickly @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is expected to be most efficient in poor groups .",
    "the tentative dependence of sf fractions on the local galaxy density also favors galaxy - galaxy interactions as the dominant mechanism .",
    "@xcite found a prominent dip at @xmath120 in the optical luminosity functions of poor groups and attributed it to galaxy merging by dynamical friction , which preferentially depletes the intermediate - luminosity galaxies .",
    "corresponding to the dip , there is also a bump at brighter magnitudes ( @xmath121 ) , which can be explained by the boosted galaxy number resulting from merged lower - mass galaxies .",
    "interestingly , the healthy sf fraction in our group sample also shows a potential dip at @xmath122 . in this stellar mass bin ,",
    "the group sample shows the largest deviation from the field sample , with @xmath123 fewer healthy sf galaxies .",
    "in the two neighboring mass bins , the fractions in the group sample are still lower than that in the field , but the differences are not significant .",
    "incidentally , the dip of the healthy sf fraction occurs roughly in the stellar mass range where the bump of the optical luminosity function is located ( @xmath124@xmath106 ) .",
    "this supports a scenario in which there are relatively more merged galaxies in this stellar mass range which have exhausted their gas fuel at the early starburst stage of the interaction and now show little sf .",
    "however , a larger sample of group and field galaxies would be needed to confirm this possible dip in healthy sf fractions .",
    "if such interaction  triggered starbursts are responsible for eventual sf suppression , the detection of galaxies with enhanced star formation could be direct evidence of such processes in action .",
    "however , we only detect one such galaxy in our sample .",
    "similar to our work , @xcite also failed to detect galaxies with enhanced star formation in their intermediate redshift group sample .",
    "however , the detectability of such a population in groups depends sensitively on the duration of the interaction - induced starburst . using hydrodynamical simulations ,",
    "@xcite investigated properties of merger - driven starbursts and the effects of employing different supernova feedback models .",
    "although their simulations suggest that the amount of the total gas consumption of the merger - induced star formation that is directly related to sf suppression is invariant with respect to the choice of feedback model , the duration of the starbursts does vary from model to model .",
    "their `` stiff '' feedback model assumes the star - forming gas has an equation of state @xmath125 while their `` soft '' model assumes the gas is isothermal .",
    "the stiff feedback model predicts a starburst timescale of @xmath126 gyr , whereas the soft model results in a much short timescale @xmath127 gyr .",
    "if we adopt the time scale given by the stiff feedback model , the starburst fraction of @xmath128% found for the present group sample sets an upper limit of 10% for the fraction of galaxies that have experienced such a merger - induced starburst within the last 5  gyr .",
    "this fraction falls short of explaining the 30% deficit of sf galaxy found in current groups population compared to the field .",
    "however , if we adopt the shorter timescale given by the soft feedback model , enough merger - induced starbursts will have occurred within the last 24  gyr to explain the deficit .",
    "in addition to galaxy - galaxy interactions , other mechanisms could also be at work within the group environment . even though the gas density of the intragroup medium is usually not sufficient to ram pressure strip the cold disk gas in a galaxy , it could efficiently strip any hot gaseous halo @xcite .",
    "this would cut off the supply that replenishes cold gas and eventually shut down the star formation in galaxies .",
    "the time scale of this quenching process , so - called strangulation , is much longer ( @xmath129  1  gyr ) .",
    "if it is the dominant process responsible for the deficit of sf galaxies , we would expect to see many sf galaxies with suppressed sfrs .",
    "this is inconsistent with the similar typical specific sfr we found in our group and field samples across a large stellar mass range , suggesting that strangulation is probably not the dominant mechanism for galaxies with @xmath2 in the poor groups studied here . in x - ray luminous groups ,",
    "however , this mechanism may become more important .      in hierarchical structure formation",
    ", galaxy clusters are assembled from lower mass halos and the galaxies in clusters might have been residing in group environments before they finally fell into clusters .",
    "this makes `` preprocessing '' in groups potentially important for cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the importance of preprocessing depends on the accretion history of clusters . using cdm @xmath130-body simulations",
    ", @xcite claimed that the majority of cluster galaxies ( 70% ) have never resided in a group environment before they fell into the cluster , and therefore that preprocessing in group environments could not play a significant role in explaining the difference between cluster and field galaxies .",
    "this result seems to be at odds with the observation that about half of the galaxy population resides in group environments in the nearby universe @xcite , because it would mean that clusters preferentially accrete isolated galaxies rather than galaxies in groups .",
    "the apparent discrepancy , again , is likely related to differences in the adopted group definition . @xcite",
    "define group members as the halos within the virial overdensity boundary of the hosting dark matter halos .",
    "this definition results in a much smaller fraction ( @xmath131 ) of galaxies residing in group environments compared to those found by the friends - of - friends algorithms typically used to identify groups in observational samples . given the small fraction of galaxies residing in groups according to the former definition , it is no surprise that the majority of the galaxies falling into clusters have never been preprocessed within a group environment by this definition .",
    "on the other hand , if we follow the much more relaxed group definition as adopted in friends - of - friends algorithms , we would expect a much higher fraction of cluster galaxies to have been part of the group environment prior to falling into clusters .",
    "however , even if all the cluster galaxies have been in groups , the lower fraction of sf galaxies in clusters in a large stellar mass range compared to the fraction found in the xi groups suggests that preprocessing in groups is not sufficient to explain the deficiency of sf galaxies in clusters .",
    "this is reinforced by the fact that even in the highest density regions of our groups , the sf fraction is still higher than the fraction found in the outskirts of clusters .",
    "to explain the low sf fractions in clusters , either an environmental mechanism that works in group environments must continue to work in clusters , or some other cluster - specific environmental mechanism must be invoked . in either case , further processing of sf galaxies within the cluster environment is required .    not only are the sf fractions of cluster galaxies on average smaller than in groups , but the sf galaxies in clusters have smaller specific sfrs at @xmath101 .",
    "such differences strongly support further sf suppression in clusters .",
    "@xcite found that the ir luminosity function of nearby rich clusters has the same shape at the bright end ( @xmath132  ergs s@xmath12 ) as that of field galaxies .",
    "the galaxies that contribute to the bright end of the ir luminosity function are galaxies with sfr@xmath133 , which constitute the upper envelope of the specific sfr vs stellar mass distribution of cluster galaxies ( cf .  figure  [ f_ssfr ] ) .",
    "the similarity of the bright - end shape of the ir luminosity function in different environments is corroborated by the similar upper envelope of the specific sfr vs stellar mass distribution found here .",
    "@xcite suggest this similarity points to a fast acting sf suppression mechanism in clusters , for example , ram pressure stripping , that produces few galaxies in transition .",
    "however , the comparison of the specific sfrs of cluster sf galaxies to those in the groups and field does reveal a population of massive sf galaxies ( @xmath101 ) , with suppressed but not totally extinguished sf , predominantly seen in clusters .",
    "this difference does not necessarily exclude ram pressuring stripping as an important mechanism in clusters , however , because massive galaxies are less vulnerable to such processes and could still retain some of their gas following a stripping event .",
    "the residual gas in those massive galaxies could sustain low - level sf for a much longer time .",
    "we have presented the first mid - ir study of nearby groups with complete optical spectroscopy and x - ray data .",
    "the nine groups in our sample span a wide range in velocity dispersion ( 100500  @xmath6 ) , x - ray properties , richness , and galaxy distribution .",
    "these groups are typical of the galaxy groups that make up more than half of the galaxy population in the nearby universe , and they are likely covering a wide range of evolutionary states .",
    "we analyzed the sf properties of the group galaxies from their mips 24  emission and tested for correlations with global group properties .",
    "we also compared the sf properties of the group galaxies with those of cluster and field galaxies at the same redshifts to investigate the environmental effect on galaxy evolution .",
    "our major results are summarized as follows :    \\1 ) the projected galaxy distributions of the nine groups show large variations , from more concentrated and circular distributions in the most massive groups ( @xmath134  @xmath6 ) to filamentary structures in the least massive ones ( @xmath84  @xmath6 ) .",
    "this variation , along with the lack of a dominant bgg in the group center and the generally low level of extended x - ray emission , suggests that some of these systems are not yet virialized but still in the process of collapsing .",
    "\\2 ) on average , the sf galaxy fraction ( sfr@xmath135 , @xmath56 ) in our group sample is about 30% lower than in a comparison field sample extracted from the same data , and 30% higher than in our comparison cluster sample .",
    "the sf fraction of our groups does not show a strong systematic dependence on group global properties such as velocity dispersion , total stellar mass , or the presence of detectable diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "however , the two groups with the smallest velocity dispersion ( @xmath136  @xmath6 ) do show the highest sf fractions , at a level comparable to that of the field .",
    "these conclusions remain unchanged if only considering the `` healthy '' sf galaxy fractions ( sfr/@xmath1370.2[sfr/@xmath1]@xmath139 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "\\3 ) there is no strong dependence of the sf fraction on the radial distance from the group center .",
    "the 24  sf fraction in the groups is , at all radii , larger than the corresponding fraction in the outskirts ( @xmath140 ) of rich clusters at similar redshifts .",
    "there is a weak trend of sf fractions decreasing with increasing projected galaxy density , with the lowest density regions having an sf fraction comparable to the field population . even in the highest density regions of groups ,",
    "the sf fraction is still larger than the sf fraction in the outer regions of clusters .",
    "in addition , the healthy sf fractions of cluster galaxies across a large stellar mass range are all at least 20% lower than those in groups .",
    "these pieces of evidence strongly suggest that preprocessing of galaxies in group environments prior to infall into clusters is not a sufficient explanation for the lower fraction of sf galaxies in clusters and that further processing by the cluster environment is required .",
    "\\4 ) the typical specific sfrs of sf galaxies in groups are very similar to that in the field across a wide mass range ( @xmath2 ) , favoring a quickly acting mechanism that suppresses star formation to explain the overall smaller fraction of sf galaxies in groups .",
    "the healthy sf fractions in groups show a possible dip at @xmath141 , corresponding to the bump seen in the optical luminosity function of poor groups @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the speculation that galaxy merging by dynamical friction preferentially depletes intermediate - luminosity galaxies , which become subject to rapid gas consumption during the interaction , resulting in a population of galaxies of high stellar mass and a relatively low fraction of healthy sf galaxies .",
    "if galaxy - galaxy interactions are responsible for the deficit of sf galaxies in groups , then our non - detection of a significant starburst population among current group members does indeed imply a short time - scale for any merger - induced starburst stage ( @xmath4 gyr ) .",
    "this agrees well with a supernova feedback model that assumes an isothermal state for the star - forming gas .",
    "\\5 ) at @xmath101 , the sf galaxies in clusters show much lower typical specific sfrs than galaxies in groups and the field , due to a more significant population of massive galaxies with very low sfr ( 14% of all the cluster galaxies with @xmath101 ) .",

    "<S> we present the first mid - ir study of galaxy groups in the nearby universe based on _ spitzer _ mips observations of a sample of nine redshift - selected groups from the xmm - imacs ( xi ) project , at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that on average the star - forming ( sf ) galaxy fraction in the groups is about 30% lower than the value in the field and 30% higher than in clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the sf fractions do not show any systematic dependence on group velocity dispersion , total stellar mass , or the presence of an x - ray emitting intragroup medium , but a weak anti - correlation is seen between sf fraction and projected galaxy density . </S>",
    "<S> however , even in the densest regions , the sf fraction in groups is still higher than that in cluster outskirts , suggesting that preprocessing of galaxies in group environments is not sufficient to explain the much lower sf fraction in clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the typical specific star formation rates ( sfr/@xmath1 ) of sf galaxies in groups are similar to those in the field across a wide range of stellar mass ( @xmath2 ) , favoring a quickly acting mechanism that suppresses star formation to explain the overall smaller fraction of sf galaxies in groups . </S>",
    "<S> if galaxy - galaxy interactions are responsible , then the extremely low starburst galaxy fraction ( @xmath3 ) implies a short timescale ( @xmath4 gyr ) for any merger - induced starburst stage . </S>",
    "<S> comparison to two rich clusters shows that clusters contain a population of massive sf galaxies with very low sfr ( 14% of all the galaxies with @xmath5 ) , possibly as a consequence of ram pressure stripping being less efficient in removing gas from more massive galaxies . </S>"
