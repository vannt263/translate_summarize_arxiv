    "recent experiments @xcite have demonstrated that surfaces such as w(111 ) and mo(111 ) covered by a single physical monolayer of certain metal , e.g. , pd , pt , undergo massive reconstruction from planar morphology to microscopically faceted surface after annealing to @xmath0 .",
    "the reconstructed surface consists of 3-sided pyramids with mainly @xmath1 facets , and pyramid dimensions range from @xmath2 to 100 nm .",
    "it has been shown that facets are composed of substrate atoms , and the monolayer of adsorbate remains on the outermost surface layer during the faceting transformation .",
    "another type of massive reconstruction has been very recently found in stm and leed experiment for pd on ta(111 ) system @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed surface consists of @xmath3 facets which form large triangular pyramids .",
    "the third type of reconstructed structure , coexistence of small @xmath3 facets with large @xmath1 facets , has been observed @xcite in pd on w(111 ) for prolonged annealing time ( for short annealing time only @xmath1 pyramids occurred ) .",
    "an important step in understanding the thermal stability of reconstructed surfaces was leed experiment performed in high temperatures for pd on mo(111 ) by song et al .",
    "they demonstrated existence of reversible phase transition between faceted @xmath1 and planar phases and they found that this transition has a large hysteresis , i.e. , the transition temperature in cooling cycle ( @xmath4 ) is lower than that in the heating cycle ( @xmath5 ) .    in theoretical studies of overlayer - induced faceting @xcite the first principle method",
    "have been used to calculate the surface formation energy of fcc metals ( pd , pt , au , ag , cu ) adsorbed on mo and w. results of these calculation performed for pseudomorphic adsorbate overlayer on ( 111 ) , ( 211 ) , and ( 011 ) flat surfaces show that ( 111 ) surface becomes unstable at the coverage of one physical monolayer , where the energy of ( 211 ) orientation has the lowest value . however , such energy calculation ( at t=0 ) are not sufficient to explain why some of these metals do not induce faceting , e.g. , ag / mo(111 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the first principle calculation confirmed that critical coverage to induce faceting is approximately equal to one physical monolayer ( pml ) and that the growth mode is stransky - krastanov as the surface energy increases at coverage higher than 1 pml .",
    "theoretical studies of surface reconstruction and surface phase transitions in bimetalic system are complicated problems mainly due to occurrence of long range many - body interactions",
    ". one of approaches to such problems is application of simple solid - on - solid models @xcite , in which the crystal is represented by two - dimensional array of columns .",
    "they were employed to study roughening transition @xcite , missing - row reconstruction @xcite , growth of the surface @xcite , surface diffusion @xcite , adsorption @xcite , phase transitions in two component crystal @xcite , etc .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a simple sos model for bcc(111 ) surface covered by one physical monolayer of adsorbed atoms to describe surface reconstruction and phase transitions . using monte carlo simulation we study change of the surface structure during the heating and cooling processes , phase transitions to a faceted phases , phase diagram , leed patterns and temperature dependence of diffracted intensity calculated in kinematic approximation .",
    "to study faceting in bimetalic system one needs to know interaction potentials .",
    "there are many - body potential for mo - mo and w - w interactions derived by finnis and sinclair @xcite but to our knowledge there is only ni - mo many - body potential @xcite for interaction between ( mo , w ) and fcc metals .",
    "however in ni / mo(111 ) system the faceting does not occur @xcite .",
    "therefore we are going to study overlayer induced faceting using a simple solid - on - solid ( sos ) model which describe a surface formation energy in agreement with result of the first principle calculation .    in order to construct a model of overlayer - induced faceting on bcc(111 ) surface ( bccsos ) we are taking into account some experimental evidences .",
    "there is a critical coverage , approximately equal to 1pml , to induce faceting on w(111 ) and mo(111 ) @xcite .",
    "when the coverage exceeds 1pml , extra adsorbate atoms form 3d clusters on the top of faceted surfaces . hence to simplify problem it will be assumed that coverage is constant and equal to 1pml .",
    "such coverage is equivalent to 3 , 2 , and 1 geometric monolayers of adsorbate on bcc ( 111 ) , ( 211 ) , and ( 011 ) surfaces , respectively .",
    "a second assumption is that substrate atoms ( b ) can take position in discrete bcc lattice .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , in the case of pd / w(111 ) , that both @xmath3 facets and @xmath6 facets of w are covered by pseudomorphic monolayer of pd .",
    "therefore we assume that adsorbate atoms ( a ) are also located in positions of the bcc structure .",
    "there are three types of interaction energies in this sos model : adsorbate - adsorbate interaction @xmath7 , adsorbate - substrate interaction @xmath8 , and substrate - substrate interaction @xmath9 , with the range of interaction up to forth neighbors ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) .",

    "it is worth noting that this bccsos hamiltonian of overlayer - induced faceting at constant coverage can also be used to study a clean bcc(111 ) surface by setting @xmath42 .",
    "first , we will check the stability of ideal surfaces ( 111 ) , ( 211 ) , and ( 110 ) covered with 3 , 2 , 1 geometric monolayers of a , similarly as it was performed in first principles calculations @xcite .",
    "this allows us to estimate values of model parameters for reconstruction , from ( 111 ) surface to @xmath6 or to @xmath3 faceted surface , under assumption that edge energies are neglected .",
    "using the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hsos ] ) we get the following expressions for surface energy per site for ideal face of orientation @xmath43    @xmath44 ,    @xmath45 ,    @xmath46 ,    where    @xmath47 .",

    "facets will be possible for negative values of @xmath41 and appropriate positive @xmath39 . to satisfy these conditions ,",
    "the range of interactions @xmath54 should be not smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "on the other hand , it is easy to ensure stability of bcc(111 ) surface at zero coverage ( @xmath56 ) by choosing @xmath57 and @xmath58 . thus , there is general possibility to chose a set of interactions @xmath59 in such a way that at zero coverage",
    "the bcc(111 ) surface is stable whereas for coverage equal to one physical monolayer the bcc(211 ) surface become stable .",
    "it is worth noting that surface energies per site @xmath60 are related to surface energies per surface atom @xmath61(used in first principles calculation @xcite ) in the following way @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , as the number of surface atoms is @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "moreover , above stability conditions correspond to faceting conditions @xcite expressed in terms of scaled @xmath61 , e.g. , the conditions @xmath68 , @xmath69 are equivalent to @xmath70 , @xmath71 for transformation @xmath72 .",
    "independence of stability condition on parameters @xmath73 , @xmath38 , and @xmath40 comes from assumptions on constant number of adsorbate atoms a and the restriction on column heights .",
    "therefore we neglect these parameters in further analysis what corresponds to shifting of the surface energy by @xmath74 .",

    "it is important to note that such change of heights is possible only if @xmath23 is the local maximum ( with respect to the nearest neighbors ) and @xmath79 is the local minimum because of the restriction on column heights . let us remember one of the model assumption that adsorbate atoms always stay on the column tops as we study reconstruction of b surface covered by the physical monolayer of a material .",
    "mc simulation were carried out on rectangular lattice of linear size @xmath80 along x , y direction , respectively with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) . to check the role of pbc additional simulations",

    "first , we investigate properties of the system with coupling constant @xmath81 during warming up process . at each temperature",
    "@xmath82 system spends the same annealing time @xmath83 measured in monte carlo steps per site .",

    "let us notice that these sizes of the lattice correspond to the area of @xmath89 on the bcc(111 ) surface with the lattice constant @xmath90 .",
    "the surface formation energy decreases as temperature is elevated ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) what indicates reconstruction of the surface . at @xmath91",
    "very small 3-sided \\{211 } pyramids are formed on the surface and further warming up causes growth of pyramids sizes ( see fig .  [ figure3 ] ) . by the \\{211 }",
    "pyramid we mean the pyramid built of ( 211 ) , ( 121 ) , and ( 112 ) facets .",
    "a big jump of the surface energy is observed at @xmath92 where the phase transition to disordered phase occurs . on the other hand ,",
    "discontinuous change of the surface energy is observed at @xmath93 when the system is cooling down .",
    "the hysteresis loop seen in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] indicates that the phase transition is of first order .",
    "the surface is undercooled or overheated because system rest in metastable state separated from the stable state by the free energy barrier .",
    "the hysteresis effects , dependence of temperature of the phase transition on cooling and warming , has been observed in leed experiment @xcite for pd / mo(111 ) .",
    "when system is cooling down we observe formation of large pyramids with defected faces and edges just below the temperature of the phase transition ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) .",
    "facets of similar shapes and sizes were observed at this temperature on warming . during further cooling defects",
    "disappear and pyramids take nearly ideal shapes at @xmath94 .",
    "therefore the dependence of surface energy on cooling is very week in the ordered faceted phase .",
    "it is very interesting that in the disordered phase the surface is not planar as suggested in experimental works @xcite .",
    "the structure of disordered phase contains randomly distributed small facets mainly of @xmath6 orientations what is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] where the cross section of the disordered phase is compared to cross sections of faceted \\{211 } and ideal bcc(111 ) surfaces .",
    "moreover , we calculated the average number of atoms on a facet of orientation ( 211 ) which in the disordered phase is nearly 10 .",
    "so we will call this phase as disordered faceted phase ( dfp ) . in very narrow temperature range , we observed a coexistence of a faceted @xmath6 and dfp , e.g. , in simulation at @xmath95 denoted by the triangle in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] . a surface structure in this case",
    "looks like surface of ordered phase where large pyramids are removed and on their place dfp is present . on the other hand ,",
    "there are 3-sided pyramidal holes built of large facets of @xmath6 orientation .",
    "sometimes , dfp is located also at the bottom of these holes .",
    "it is worth noting that coexistence of both faceted and disordered phases has been observed @xcite in leed experiment in pd / mo(111 ) system . however , it was suggested that coexistence is due to the inhomogeneity of the surface .",
    "one of quantities measured in mc simulation is the square mean width of the surface , @xmath96 behaviour of the @xmath97 during warming up and cooling down processes allows us to study dependence of mean vertical sizes of pyramids on temperature . in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] we present results of simulation for 3 different annealing times @xmath98 . in all cases",
    "the hysteresis loop is present near the phase transition and for shorter time a larger hysteresis is observed .",
    "it is easy to explain because it is more probable to overcome the free energy barrier in longer time . in the warming up process",
    "the size of pyramids does not depends on the annealing time @xmath83 up to @xmath99 .",
    "when temperature approaches @xmath94 then a rapid growth is observed and for longer annealing time @xmath83 greater pyramids are formed on the surface .",
    "pyramids reach maximal sizes just below the temperature of the phase transition where dependence of sizes on annealing time is the strongest .",
    "it worth noting that dependence of facets size on temperature qualitatively agrees with the experimental results @xcite .     during the heating and the cooling cycles for 3 different annealing times .",
    "each label contains symbols for heating , cooling and the number of mc steps , width=264 ]    the value of @xmath97 rapidly decreases above the phase transition where very weak dependence on temperature is observed . in the cooling down process",
    "large pyramids are formed just below the phase transition temperature , and further decreasing of temperature practically does not change the size of pyramids .",
    "we check dependence of surface growth on the initial temperature @xmath84 and we find that the behaviour of @xmath97 near the transition point is very similar to that in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] for process which starts at @xmath100 or @xmath101 .",
    "finally we analyze the influence of the temperature increment , @xmath102 , on the surface energy and the @xmath97 near the phase transition for @xmath103 .",
    "we found that for @xmath104 the hysteresis loop slightly increases , there are more points where the faceted and disordered phases coexist but it seems that sizes of pyramids do not depend on the temperature increment .",
    "we observe that the growth of the facets on warming base on formation of a larger pyramid from several smaller pyramids .",
    "probability of such rebuilding of the surface is very small at low temperature .",
    "this is reflected in the acceptance ratio @xmath105 , a fraction of accepted configurations in the markov chain , which is very low at low temperatures , @xmath106 below @xmath107 and @xmath108 at @xmath109 .",
    "on the other hand , the acceptance ratio is of the same order for @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and close to the phase transition , @xmath112 , but we observe difference in facets sizes at these temperatures .",
    "looking at snapshots of the surface after annealing at temperature up to @xmath113 on warming , we found that pyramids have nearly ideal shapes ( see for example fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) .",
    "we think that all above observation can be explained in the following way .",
    "the system is passing through metastable states - local minima of the free energy - as temperature is increased .",
    "there are barriers between local minima hence the growth of facets depends on the annealing time .",
    "the stability analysis of flat ( 111 ) , ( 211 ) , and ( 110 ) surfaces in sec .",
    "[ s2_stab ] shows that at @xmath114 the ( 211 ) surface is stable for @xmath115 whereas for @xmath116 the ( 110 ) surface is stable . whether these findings are generally correct we can check constructing phase diagram in the ( t , k ) plane by using mc simulations .",
    "most of simulations were performed at constant k varying temperature . to check the results",
    "some simulations were performed at constant temperature . to identify different phases we calculated masses of clusters of different facet orientations ( 111 ) , @xmath117 , and @xmath6 .",
    "a cluster of orientation ( hkl ) is defined in similar way as percolation cluster on the ( hkl ) plane .",
    "we also recorded equilibrium configurations at each investigated point of the ( t , k ) plane .",
    "we found that for @xmath118 the phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ) contains three phases    1 .",
    "faceted @xmath6 phase consisting of 3-sided @xmath6 pyramids .",
    "2 .   faceted @xmath117 phase consisting of 3-sided @xmath117 pyramids .",
    "3 .   disordered faceted phase .",
    "the surface of the faceted @xmath117 phase is built of ( 110 ) , ( 101 ) , and ( 011 ) facets which form 3-sided pyramids on the bcc(111 ) surface .",
    "such surface has been observed experimentally in pd on ta(111 ) system @xcite .",
    "the phase transition between the disordered phase and one of ordered is of first order as surface energy , the square mean width of the surface @xmath119 , and the structure factor ( see sec .",
    "[ s5 ] ) change discontinuously at the transition point .",
    "the transition temperature between f\\{211 } and disordered phase is bounded from above by maximum @xmath120 at @xmath121 .",
    "if we chose this point to estimate model parameters for pd / mo(111 ) with @xmath122 k we get @xmath123 ev , and @xmath124 ev . on the other hand the transition temperature from f\\{110 } to the disordered phases is increasing function of @xmath125 and it might reach large value . the present model does not include the desorption , thus we can expect that transition temperature might be above the desorption temperature in some systems especially where the faceted f\\{110 } phase occurs . in such cases",
    "the phase transition to the disordered faceted phase could not be observed but rather deconstruction induced by desorption would be expected .",

    "we use such procedure because the surface does not consist of ideal flat \\{211 } facets during warming up and cooling processes , therefore spots can change shapes , intensities , and positions .",

    "first of all the phase transition can be studied in details using this model .",
    "it is shown that the phase transition is of first order because quantities such as surface energy , the structure factor change discontinuously as temperature reaches the transition point .",
    "moreover the hysteresis effects are observed when system is warming up and then cooling down .",
    "we can analyze the structure of the surface in disordered phase as well as in the coexistence of the faceted and disorder phase close to the transition temperature .",
    "we found that the disordered phase consists of many small \\{211 } facets randomly distributed .",
    "hence it is not planar bcc(111 ) surface",
    ". it would be interesting to check experimentally this prediction .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that coexistence of faceted and disordered phases is due to the inhomogeneity of the adsorbate coverage but we have demonstrated that the coexistence could also exist for homogeneous coverage .",
    "it seems that this model can be applied to study reconstruction of curved bcc surfaces where reconstructed surface has different structure than faceted bcc(111 ) surface . in case of pd deposited on a needle - shaped tungsten @xcite , step like \\{211 } microfacets has been observed . using the present model we have not obtained the faceted phase with large \\{211 } pyramids and small \\{011 } pyramids as observed in pd / w(111 ) @xcite for prolonged annealing time .",
    "this might be due to lack of density fluctuation .",
    "so we are going to extend the model including dependence on coverage .",
    "the most general extension should base on replacing of the interactions @xmath54 by many - body potentials .",
    "to construct such potentials , e.g. , for mo - pd , w - pd systems , the results of the first - principle calculations could be used @xcite ."
