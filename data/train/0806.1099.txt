    "deep inelastic muon - nucleus scattering in the european muon collaboration showed that the electromagnetic ( em ) properties of the nucleon in nuclear medium could be different from those in free space @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the magnetic moment of the proton in @xmath0 seemed enhanced by about 25  % compared to that in free space @xcite .",
    "experiments were performed to explore various observables that could indicate medium effects on the em properties of the nucleon , such as longitudinal response function , polarization transfer , induced polarization , and etc .",
    "a very recent experiment at jlab @xcite provides another positive indication of the medium modification of the em form factors of the nucleon . on the theoretical side ,",
    "several models that treat the nucleon as a composite system of quarks were proposed to calculate the in - medium em form factors of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "a cloudy bag model calculation @xcite predicted a substantial enhancement of the magnetic moment in the nuclear medium in the range 220  % . on the other hand , models such as light - front constituent quark model @xcite , quark - meson coupling model with pion cloud @xcite ,",
    "skyrme model @xcite , chiral quark soliton model @xcite and nambu - jona - lasino model @xcite give less enhancement , up to 10  % at most .",
    "quasi - elastic electron - nucleus scattering was expected to provide possible indications for the in - medium modification of nucleon structure functions , and investigations along this line were performed . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the cross sections for quasi - elastic @xmath1 scattering were calculated with and without the in - medium em form factors .",
    "but the results showed no clear indication of medium modification .",
    "although much work has been done in both theory and experiment , the situation still remains controversial , especially for the magnetic moment .",
    "in this work we calculate the magnetic moments of the octet baryons in nuclear matter with the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) @xcite and the modified quark - meson coupling ( mqmc ) @xcite models .",
    "based on the mit bag model , these models provide a simple but robust tool for the description of baryon properties in free space and bulk properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite and neutron stars @xcite . saito and thomas calculated the in - medium magnetic moment of the proton in symmetric matter with the qmc model @xcite . an interesting result in their work",
    "is the dependence of the magnetic moment on the bag radius .",
    "three values of the bag radius , 0.6 , 0.8 and 1.0 fm were adopted for the proton in free space .",
    "changes in the values of the magnetic moments due to the medium from those in free space are relatively small , but the changes depend considerably on the bag radius in free space . for instance , the magnetic moment in medium at the nuclear saturation density is only about 1  % larger than that in free space if the bag radius is chosen as 0.6 fm , but if the bag radius is 1.0 fm the magnetic moment becomes about 7  % larger .",
    "we shall investigate the model dependence of the magnetic moments in medium by considering both the qmc and mqmc models .",
    "while the qmc model has the problem of yielding too small a spin - orbit interaction , the mqmc model with the density - dependent bag constant produces the magnitudes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 meson fields similar to those obtained from the dirac phenomenology and quantum hadrodynamics , which produce the right magnitudes of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the mqmc model is also able to reproduce the nuclear saturation properties better than the qmc model , which will be presented in sec.iia .",
    "a big difference between the bag properties obtained from qmc and mqmc is in the behavior of the bag radius in nuclear matter . in the qmc model ,",
    "the bag radius decreases as density increases , but in the mqmc model the bag radius increases with density @xcite . since the magnetic moment depends on the bag radius , it is expected that the prediction of the magnetic moment from the mqmc model will differ from that obtained from the qmc model .",
    "the magnetic moment of a hyperon in medium was experimentally studied only recently .",
    "the magnetic moment of a @xmath4 hyperon in a hypernucleus @xmath5 has been measured at bnl @xcite .",
    "the result is still preliminary with large errors .",
    "further experiments are needed , for example , in j - parc @xcite to determine the in - medium em properties of the hyperon .",
    "thus it is timely to investigate the magnetic moment of hyperons in medium theoretically . in sec .",
    "ii , basic ingredients of the models are presented .",
    "the magnetic moments of octet baryons are expressed in terms of the quark wave functions .",
    "iii shows numerical results , and discussions on the model dependence and the correlation between the bag radius and the magnetic moments follow .",
    "iv summarizes the paper .",
    "in the qmc model a nucleon in nuclear matter is described by a static mit bag in which quarks couple to meson fields that are treated as mean fields .",
    "the quark field @xmath6 inside the bag satisfies the dirac equation @xmath7\\ , \\psi_q = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 @xmath9 is the bare quark mass , @xmath2 and @xmath10 are the mean fields of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons , respectively , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the quark - meson coupling constants . here , we assume @xmath13 and @xmath14 mev .",
    "the ground state solution of the dirac equation is given by @xmath15 with @xmath16/x^2_q,\\\\ \\epsilon_q & = & \\omega_q + g^q_\\omega\\,\\omega_0 \\ , r , \\\\",

    "the value of @xmath21 is determined from the boundary condition on the bag surface ; @xmath22 the energy of a baryon with ground state quarks is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the bag constant , and @xmath25 is a phenomenological constant introduced to take into account the zero - point motion of the baryon .",
    "we use the subscript ` @xmath26 ' to denote the species of a baryon .",
    "the effective mass of a baryon @xmath26 in medium is given by @xmath27    there are three bag parameters for each baryon , @xmath28 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "if one of them can be fixed , the other two can be determined to reproduce the mass @xmath29 of a baryon @xmath26 in free space at a bag radius @xmath28 , where @xmath30 . for nucleons in free space ,",
    "we choose @xmath31 as a free parameter assuming @xmath32 .",
    "in actual calculations , we consider a wide range of @xmath31 , @xmath33  fm . for hyperons",
    ", we assume the bag radius of hyperons to be the same as that of nucleons , @xmath34 , which then allows us to fix @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the prescribed manner .",
    "the bag constant @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath37 = 0.6 fm are taken from ref .",

    "[ fig : mm_result ] , the magnetic moments calculated by the mqmc model are quite different from those in the qmc model . the magnetic moments of all the baryons increase uniformly , but the slope of @xmath39 is steeper than that of other @xmath40 s . the magnetic moments at @xmath41 are listed in table  [ tab : mm_mqmc ] . at the saturation density ,",
    "the magnetic moment of a nucleon in the mqmc model increases by about 25  % from its free space value , which is much larger than the increase observed with the qmc model ( @xmath42 % ) . also , the mqmc models predicts the value of @xmath43 at the saturation density to increase by about 10  % , which is in sharp contrast with the qmc prediction , in which case @xmath43 in medium remains almost the same as the free space value .",
    "comparing table [ tab : mm_qmc ] and table [ tab : mm_mqmc ] shows the values of @xmath44 s and @xmath45 s are considerably different depending on the model used .",
    "the differences in the @xmath46 values calculated by the qmc and the mqmc models can be attributed to the fact that the bag radii change considerably in the mqmc model .",
    "since the bag constant decreases very rapidly with density in the mqmc model , the bag radius increases with density to satisfy the minimization condition , @xmath47 .    to see how much the magnetic moments are correlated with the values of the bag radius @xmath48 , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm_compare ] @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath4 together with the ratio @xmath51 .",
    "( we consider here only two cases of @xmath50 and @xmath4 because @xmath52 and @xmath53 are simply proportional to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . )",
    "the results from the qmc and mqmc models are plotted in the upper and lower panels , respectively .",
    "the dotted curve in the upper panel of fig . [ fig : rm_compare ] represents @xmath56 calculated by qmc .",
    "we can see that @xmath56 remains almost the same as the value in free space . as a result , @xmath39 denoted by the solid curve",
    "also changes just a little , less than 10% . for a @xmath4 hyperon , the dashed curve denoting the ratio @xmath57 overlaps with the dash - dotted curve for @xmath58 , and so they are not distinguishable in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm_compare ] .",
    "since @xmath58 remains almost constant with respect to @xmath59 , @xmath60 also remains almost constant .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rm_compare ] also shows that the bag radii and the magnetic moments of both @xmath61 and @xmath4 in the mqmc model are strongly correlated .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is rather similar to that of @xmath64 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "it is known that for massless quarks @xmath65 is proportional to the bag radius @xmath17 , @xmath66 @xcite . for general cases where @xmath67",
    ", the analysis becomes complicated .",
    "figure [ fig : rm_compare ] , however , indicates that such a relation still remains valid to some extent for the cases considered in this work .",
    "we have considered in this work the changes of the magnetic moments of octet baryons in dense matter for the first time in the framework of the quark - meson coupling model .",
    "both octet baryons and nuclear matter are treated in a consistent manner by using the quark - meson coupling models .",
    "model dependence is investigated by employing the qmc and the mqmc models , which differ in the density dependence of the bag constant .",
    "the qmc model predicts that the magnetic moments of octet baryons at the saturation density change only by a few percents from those in free space .",
    "in particular , the magnetic moment of @xmath4 practically does not change from the free - space value in the qmc model . on the other hand",
    ", we obtain quite different results from the mqmc model . in the mqmc model ,",
    "the magnetic moment of a nucleon at the saturation density increases by about 25  % from the free - space value , and the magnetic moment of @xmath4 also increases by about 10  % .",
    "a similar amount of increase in the magnetic moment is also observed for other hyperons .",
    "the reason for this model dependence can be ascribed mainly to the behavior of the bag radius in nuclear matter , which comes from the change in the bag constant with respect to the density .",
    "the self - consistency equations in the qmc and mqmc models are highly nonlinear .",
    "thus it is not straightforward to see how magnetic moments are related to the bag radius .",
    "however , by comparing the density dependence of the magnetic moment with that of the bag radius for each baryon , we find that the two quantities behave rather similarly as functions of density . in the qmc model ,",
    "the bag radii of the baryons decrease only slightly at the saturation density from the free - space values , by about 1  % .",
    "the magnetic moments calculated with the qmc model change more or less in the same ratios . in the mqmc model ,",
    "the bag radii and the magnetic moments behave very similarly and increase by about 10  20  % at the nuclear saturation density .",
    "our present results for magnetic moments in nuclear matter may not be directly comparable to the magnetic moments of baryons in finite nuclei .",
    "however , our results show that there can be significant changes of the magnetic moments in nuclei , and further investigations are needed to to understand the medium modification of the em properties of baryons .",
    "in particular , it is desirable to measure the magnetic moments of these octet baryons in nuclei , which can also give us information on various medium effects on hyperons @xcite .",
