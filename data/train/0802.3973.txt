    "the interplay between hydrodynamic motion and the distribution of marine organisms like phytoplankton and zooplankton is a major challenge recently addressed in numerous studies @xcite .",
    "the growth of phytoplankton in the world s oceans depends strongly on the availability of nutrients .",
    "thus , one of the essential factors controlling the primary production is the vertical transport of nutrients .",
    "coastal upwelling is one of the most important mechanisms of this type .",
    "it usually occurs when wind - driven currents , in combination with the coriolis force , produces ekman transport , by which surface waters are driven away from the coast and are replaced by nutrient - rich deep waters . due to this nutrient enrichment , primary production in these areas",
    "is strongly boosted , giving rise also to an increase of zooplankton and fish populations .    on the other side , the interplay between plankton dynamics and horizontal transport , mixing and stirring has been investigated in several studies recently @xcite .",
    "horizontal stirring by mesoscale structures like vortices and jets redistributes plankton and nutrients and may enhance primary production @xcite .",
    "horizontal transport can also initiate phytoplankton blooms and affects competition and coexistence of different plankton species @xcite .",
    "vertical upwelling in connection with strong mesoscale activity occurs in several places on earth .",
    "one of these regions is the atlantic ocean area close to the northwestern african coast , near the canary archipelago .",
    "the main water current in this area flows from the northeast towards the canary islands , in which wake strong mesoscale hydrodynamic activity is observed  @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the vortices emerging in the wake of the canary islands and the ekman flow seems to be essential for the observed enhancement of biological production in the open southern atlantic ocean close to the canary islands  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the interplay between the redistribution of plankton by the vortices and the primary production .",
    "in particular we focus on the role of residence times of plankton particles in the wake of the island . though we believe that our study is relevant for different areas in the world , we focus on the situation around the canary archipelago to be specific .    in this work",
    "we consider the coupling of the kinematic flow introduced in @xcite to a simplified model of plankton dynamics with three trophic levels , and study the impact of the underlying hydrodynamic activity and the upwelling of nutrients on primary production in different areas of the wake . in this setup vortices",
    "have been reported to play an essential role in the enhancement of primary production @xcite .",
    "our main objective here is to analyze this mechanism in detail and show that the extended residence times of plankton within vortices are responsible for the observation of localized algal blooms in them .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ general ]",

    "our main analysis is devoted to the mechanism of the appearance of a localized plankton bloom within a vortex ( sec .",
    "[ results ] ) .",
    "we study the residence times of plankton within vortices and in the neighborhood of the island .",
    "additionally we clarify the role of the chaotic saddle embedded in the flow in the wake of the island .",
    "finally we summarize and discuss our results in sec . [ conclusions ] .",
    "our system consists of a hydrodynamic flow with an embedded obstacle and vortices in its wake .",
    "the model contains also a current perpendicular to the main flow that models an ekman flow coming from the coast , and a nutrient - rich region at a distance from the obstacle simulating a coastal upwelling zone .",
    "a sketch of the model is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : area ] . with this simplified geometry",
    "we mimic the essential features of the hydrodynamic flow in the canaries ( note that the whole canary archipelago is approximated by one cylindrical island ) . in particular , in the wake of the obstacle strong mesoscale activity is observed in the form of a periodic detachment of vortices , which then travel in the main flow direction .",
    "we use the kinematic model first developed by @xcite , which we modified by the introduction of the ekman flow @xcite .",
    "this model is coupled to a simple population dynamics which features the interaction of nutrients @xmath0 , phytoplankton @xmath1 and zooplankton @xmath2 .",

    "this corresponds to a stream crossing the vortex street towards negative @xmath5 values beyond the cylinder .",
    "real oceanic flows are never perfectly periodic",

    "a detailed analysis can be found in @xcite , here we only recall the main results which are the basis of the analysis we present here .",
    "we have studied two essentially different inflow conditions :    1 .   in the first one fluid parcels",

    "since those concentrations are very low , we take into account that fluctuations may be important by adding to each of the concentrations @xmath61 some gaussian noise term ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the two inflow concentrations yield different behavior as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] . in the first case",
    "we observe high biological activity connected with a high primary production in the area outside vortices .",
    "namely , this is the area of the nutrient plumes advected from the upwelling region ( fig .",

    "by contrast , in the second inflow case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] right column ) we obtain a high phytoplankton concentration within the vortices .",
    "it turns out that here the vortices act as incubators for primary production leading to localized plankton blooms . in the first inflow case",
    "the behavior is easy to understand since due to higher nutrient concentrations in the upwelling region and its neighborhood a high growth of phytoplankton is expected .",
    "the response on the upwelling of nutrients in the second case is less obvious .",
    "therefore the main objective of this paper is to find out the mechanism of the localized plankton blooms . in the rest of this work",
    "we consider only the situation that the concentrations at inflow are at their low values @xmath62 .",
    "after specifying the complete model and its dynamics we now investigate the behavior of the coupled biological and hydrodynamical system from different perspectives to clarify the mechanism of localized enhancement of phytoplankton and primary production connected to vortices .",
    "firstly we study the biological model alone to understand the interplay between the three biological components @xmath63 and @xmath2 leading to a sharp increase of phytonplankton for some time interval .",
    "this study yields a certain biological time scale for the growth of plankton which we compare in a second step to the hydrodyamical time scale obtained from the investigations of residence times in vortices .",
    "thirdly we discuss the role of the chaotic saddle embedded in the flow for the emergence of localized enhanced plankton growth .      to study the enhancement of primary production and the emergence of localized algal blooms we have first to analyze the dynamics of the biological model .",
    "there is no commonly accepted definition of an algal bloom .",
    "usually a large increase in the phytoplankton concentrations is considered as a bloom . in most cases such blooms",
    "are observed once or twice a year due to seasonal forcing . in our case",
    "the phytoplankton bloom is not related to an external forcing and appears only on a rather short time scale .",
    "we consider the case where there appears a sharp increase in phytoplankton as a result of an enrichment with nutrients @xcite .",
    "since the long - term behavior of our model is stationary for the parametrization used , the emergence of a sharp increase in phytoplankton is a transient phenomenon and its time scale is important for the mechanism of localized enhancement of the primary production .",
    "the time evolution of the three components and the primary production @xmath64 of the model system towards the steady state concentrations @xmath65 ( @xmath66 or @xmath64 ) is shown in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : bioalone - over - t ] . with starting concentrations @xmath67 steady - state concentrations of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , first the nutrient concentration increases and , after a time lag , primary production and phytoplankton concentration follow with a large increase .",
    "this growth is approximately exponential when the nutrients reach their maximum .",
    "finally , with a larger time lag the concentration of predators ( zooplankton ) increases as well and the bloom ends due to two factors : nutrient depletion and increased grazing by zooplankton . for comparison in the lower panel of fig .",

    "the overshooting in nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations at the beginning of the time evolution is less pronounced ( because there are more predators already present ) and the concentrations converge faster towards the steady - state .    from these simulations",
    "we can estimate the time scale for the biological growth : to reach the maximum of the bloom , only 15 to 25 days are necessary depending on the initial condition .",
    "the time scale for the whole relaxation process is about @xmath69 , i.e. about 60 days . to understand the interplay between the biological growth and the hydrodynamic mesoscale structures we have to compare this biological time scale with the hydrodynamic one .",

    "we study the various structures in the hydrodynamic flow which have a significant influence on the residence times of nutrients and plankton in the wake of the island .",
    "firstly , far away from the island ( top and bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] ) the flow is strain dominated and particles like nutrients and plankton are advected with the background flow of speed @xmath20 .",
    "thus the residence time of particles released away from the island ( with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) is about 16 days .",

    "[ fig : trajectory],title=\"fig : \" ]    secondly we note the existence of the eddies .",
    "they are characterized by a dominance of vorticity compared to strain .",
    "thus particles are trapped in the vortex once entrained to it .",
    "the particles will rotate in the vortex for some time , but since this confinement is not perfect and vortices exist only for some time they leave the vortex and move away with the background flow out of the computational area ( cf .",

    "( lower plot ) , and @xmath74 ( upper plot ) .",
    "[ fig : unstable - mani],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    thirdly we consider two other geometrical objects which are also relevant for the residence time of particles in the vortex street : the chaotic saddle and the cylinder boundary .",
    "as shown in @xcite there exists a chaotic saddle which is embedded in the flow beyond the island . at least for short time",
    "scales , this invariant set determines the residence times of particles .",
    "particles released in the neighborhood of the chaotic saddle will approach it along its stable manifold and will leave it along its unstable manifold .",
    "the unstable manifolds at two different times ( the manifolds and the saddle are time - dependent ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : unstable - mani ] .",
    "as compared with the configuration in @xcite , the manifolds are tightly packed close to the cylinder , because of the parameters used here . to obtain an estimate for the residence time on the chaotic saddle",
    "we use a method suggested by @xcite .",
    "we sprinkle a large number @xmath0 of tracer particles ( @xmath75 ) in the area @xmath76\\times[-1,1]$ ] and integrate their trajectories forward in time . if the dynamics in the region is mainly hyperbolic , the number of particles remaining in the area of the chaotic saddle decreases as @xmath77 with @xmath78 the escape rate or @xmath79 the mean residence time on the saddle .",
    "figure [ fig : res - time ] shows the residence times obtained with this method , and fig .",
    "[ fig : res - time - fit ] shows the decay of the number of particles in the region as a function time .",
    "we note that the expected exponential decay occurs only for very short time scales . by fitting this initial time decay , the corresponding escape rate is @xmath80 , and therefore the residence time of tracers in the hyperbolic part of the saddle is @xmath81 days . for larger times",
    "the particle number in the region decays as a power law .",
    "the reason for this power - law behavior is the non - hyperbolic dynamics near the boundary of the cylinder . as already shown by @xcite particles",
    "stay for a long time in the vicinity of the cylinder giving rise to another long - term statistics of the residence times of the tracers .",
    "thus the number of particles decays as @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "the residence times in the vicinity of the island can be estimated as @xmath84 days , measured from the decay to a fraction @xmath85 of the initial number : @xmath86 .",
    "overall we obtain a residence time statistics which reflects a combination of the three components in the flow : the cylinder , the chaotic saddle and the vortices .",
    "this leads to residence times of tracers in the wake as long as @xmath87 days ( cf .",
    "[ fig : res - time ] ) .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : res - time ] one can see that tracers having the longer residence times are either located close to the cylinder or on the chaotic saddle .",

    "[ fig : res - time],title=\"fig : \" ]    [ t ]          to understand the emergence of localized enhancement of primary production we have to analyze the interplay of the different time scales relevant for coupled biological and hydrodynamical processes .",
    "biological evolution needs about 30 - 60 days to reach the steady - state when entering the computational domain with very low concentrations of nutrients and plankton . due to the exponential growth in the beginning of the growth phase",
    ", we obtain a plankton bloom after about 25 days . outside the vortex street the travel time of tracers through the computational domain is only about 16 days due to the background flow of @xmath89 m / s .",
    "therefore we can not expect a considerable growth of plankton outside the vortex street , since the residence time of plankton and nutrients is too short .",
    "let us now analyze the situation within the mesoscale structures of the flow in the wake of the island . as the residence time close to the island is about 85 days the concentrations of nutrients and plankton",
    "have already reached the steady - state which is also indicated by the green color in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] . some of the particles in the vicinity of the island come close to the stable manifold of the chaotic saddle visible as the filaments which detach from the cylinder .",
    "these filaments are stretched and folded along the unstable manifold of the chaotic saddle , being diffusively diluted during the process by mixing with the poor surrounding waters .",
    "thus , very thin filaments of low plankton and nutrient concentration are produced which are first rolled around the vortices and then entrained by them . inside the vortex",
    "the concentrations become homogeneised to a low value .",
    "these very low concentrations of plankton experience the bloom cycle described in section [ plankton growth ] during the time they are trapped and confined by the vortex .",
    "since the travel time for the vortices is about 50 days , plankton in them has time to grow .",
    "therefore we observe a localized plankton bloom when the vortex has travelled a distance of @xmath90 km which corresponds to a residence of the plankton in the vortices of @xmath91 days .",
    "after 40 - 50 days and @xmath92 km we obtain steady - state concentrations and the former filamental structure within the vortex is smeared out by our diffusion term which mimics small scale turbulence .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have stated that the transport of nutrients and plankton from the vicinity into the interior of a vortex happens by filaments which are entrained by the vortex . to explain this stretching mechanism we now study the mixing process around the vortices in more detail using a method to visualize exponential divergence of the trajectories of initially nearby particles .",
    "the usual tool to analyse exponential divergence in dynamical systems theory is the computation of lyapunov exponents . in order to adjust this concept to local processes ,",
    "we compute finite size lyapunov exponents ( fsle ) which are based on the idea that one measures the time necessary to obtain a final prescribed distance @xmath93 starting from an initial distance @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "for a two - dimensional flow we obtain two lyapunov exponents @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( see appendix b ) .    [ t ]      at time @xmath88 .",
    "stable and unstable manifolds in the flow are approximated by the most positive and most negative filaments in the distributions .",

    "the contracting fsle , @xmath96 , detects the underlying unstable manifold of the chaotic flow , the direction along which parcels are stretched out of the saddle . for details on how to calculate these scalar fields",
    "see appendix b.    the fsles were calculated choosing the initial separation @xmath94 equal to the gridsize and the final separation @xmath93 equal to the radius of the island and the vortices , since this is the scale of the motion in the wake . as both stable and unstable manifolds can not be crossed by fluid parcels they are barriers @xcite .",
    "the scalar field @xmath97 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsle - v - r ]",
    ". fsles are lagrangian measures , which are computed from trajectories that remain in the flow for a long time , in our case for up to @xmath98 .",
    "therefore even though they are plotted as a snapshot , the visualized structures reflect the stretching and folding of the fluid parcels during this long time .",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds are intertwined around the vortex cores and at the island .",
    "stable and unstable manifolds are crossing the wake allowing for transport across the vortex street .",
    "they intersect each other in hyperbolic points , regions of strong mixing .",
    "this stretching - compressing mechanism leads to low nutrient and plankton concentrations transported into the interior of the vortex , and thus becoming the starting concentrations for the localized plankton bloom .",
    "finally we discuss the importance of the vertical mixing of nutrients in the upwelling zone for the emergence of a plankton bloom inside vortices . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] left and right column it is obvious that in the case of an inflow with steady - state conditions ( left column ) , the nutrient plume which appears in the neighborhood of the upwelling zone gives rise to a phytoplankton bloom ( red filamental plume ) . such a plume is almost absent under low inflow conditions ( right column ) .",
    "though the nutrient supply due to vertical mixing is identical for both inflow conditions , it seems to have a limited effect in the low inflow case .",
    "one argument has been already discussed above : the background flow transports the nutrients too fast so that the very small plankton concentrations can not grow to reach high values during the travel time through the computational area .",
    "the growth of phytoplankton is visible only further downstream .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the plankton bloom inside the vortex is only slightly influenced by the extra nutrients entrained from the upwelling zone in the low inflow situation . to strengthen this statement we present in fig .",

    "we note that the concentration values for phytoplankton and zooplankton are slightly lower compared to the upwelling regime , but qualitatively there is no change observable .",

    "we have analyzed the interplay between hydrodynamic mesoscale structures and biological growth in the wake of an island .",
    "parameter values for the kinematic hydrodynamic flow were chosen to match the observations for the canary island region , but since the basic hydrodynamic features studied here are commonly observed in other areas too , we expect our results to be of general validity .",
    "our study is focused on the emergence of a plankton bloom localized in a vortex in the wake of an island . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "it has been pointed out that under certain conditions a vortex may act as an incubator for plankton growth and primary production .",
    "here we have revealed the mechanism of such a plankton bloom .",
    "if the hydrodynamic flow far away from the island is dominated by a jet , then the hydrodynamic time scale is much faster than the biological one , so that considerable growth of plankton can not be observed . by contrast , in the wake of an island we obtain a much slower time scale which becomes comparable to the biological one giving rise to an exponential growth of phytoplankton and thus to the emergence of a plankton bloom within a vortex .",
    "the essential factors for this phenomenon to happen are ( i ) the long residence times in the vicinity of the island leading to an enrichment of nutrients and plankton in the neighborhood of the island ; ( ii ) the transport and subsequent entrainment of nutrients and plankton to the interior of the vortex due to filamental structures emerging with the chaotic saddle beyond the island , and ( iii ) the confinement of plankton in the vortex . though the upwelling of nutrients in an upwelling zone enhances the emergence of localized plankton blooms , it is not a precondition for this phenomenon to occur .",
    "the extra nutrients supplied by vertical mixing in areas away from the vortex street are not a part of the mechanism explained here .",
    "upwelling could be more effective if the vortices directly cross upwelling zones when travelling through the ocean .",
    "similar situations have been considered in @xcite .",
    "there it has been shown that under conditions where upwelling occurs only directly within vortices , a plankton bloom within a vortex can be initiated .",
    "therefore this mechanism , which relies mostly on upwelling , is different from the one reported here .",
    "the variety of real observations @xcite in the canary wake may benefit from the identification of the different possible mechanisms .",
    "the investigation of the interplay of biological and physical processes is based on advection - reaction - diffusion systems ( eqs .",

    "this system of partial differential equations is solved numerically by means of a semi - lagrangian algorithm .",
    "the concentration fields of nutrients @xmath0 , phytoplankton @xmath1 and zooplankton @xmath2 are represented on a grid of [ 500 x 300 ] points .",
    "the integration scheme splits the computation into three steps corresponding to advection , reaction and diffusion which are performed sequentially in the following way :    1 .",
    "advection : each point of the grid is integrated for a time step @xmath99 backwards in time along the trajectory of a fluid parcel in the velocity field .",
    "this procedure yields the position from which a fluid parcel would have reached the chosen grid point . typically this position is not located on a grid point but somewhere in between .",
    "reaction : once the position of the fluid parcel in the past is found , we compute the values of the concentration fields of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 at this point and take them as initial values for the reaction term which is integrated forward in time for a time step @xmath99 . since the position of the fluid parcel is not on a grid point the concentration fields have to be evaluated by means of a bilinear interpolation using the nearest neighbor grid points .",
    "diffusion : finally we perform a diffusion step based on an eulerian scheme .",
    "note , that the reaction step induces already a numerical diffusion of the order @xmath100 due to the interpolation .",
    "therefore one has to make sure that the real diffusion according to the okubo estimate (  @xmath101 , dimensionless value @xmath102 ) @xcite is larger than this numerical diffusion",
    ". additionally the stability condition of the eulerian diffusion step ( @xmath103 with @xmath104 the diffusion time step ) has to be fulfilled .",
    "both conditions together require that the diffusion time step @xmath104 is much smaller than @xmath99 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath105 in our algorithm , i.e. after each step of advection and reaction we perform 10 steps of diffusion .",
    "the parameters used in the computation are @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 expressed in units of @xmath109 for time and @xmath110 for space .",
    "stretching by advection in fluid flows is often described by means of lyapunov exponents .",
    "they are defined as the average of the exponential rate of separation of initially infinitesimally separated parcels . for application with data sets from tracer experiments",
    "the infinite time limit poses a problem . to study non - asymptotic dispersion processes , finite size lyapunov exponents ( fsle )",
    "have been introduced @xcite .",
    "the fsle technique allows us to characterize dispersion processes and to detect and visualize lagrangian structures , such as barriers and vortices .",
    "the fsle are computed by starting two fluid elements at time @xmath111 close to the point @xmath112 but at a small distance @xmath94 , and let them to evolve until their separation exceeds @xmath93 . from the elapsed time , @xmath113 ,",
    "the fsle is calculated as @xmath114 the positive subindexes indicate that the tracers are advected forward in time .",
    "@xmath115 is a scalar measure giving the stretching rate in the flow as it is the inverse of the separation time @xmath116 .",
    "the same definition can be applied to tracers integrated in the negative direction in time .",
    "@xmath117 gives the contraction rate in the flow at the specified position : @xmath118    regions with high values of @xmath115 and @xmath117 trace out approximately the stable and unstable manifolds of the chaotic saddle .",
    "these manifolds can not be crossed by fluid parcel trajectories and thus greatly influence the transport in the area .",
