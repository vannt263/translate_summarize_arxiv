    "the effect considered can be used for an experimental study of the dynamical properties of two - dimensional electron layers at large wave vectors , for which the interaction of the electrons with the surface acoustic wave is suppressed exponentially due to the finite value of the distance between the electron layer and the surface of the sample .",
    "the renormalization of the phase velocity of the nonuniform elastic modes coupled to the double - layer fractional quantum hall system is calculated .",
    "it is shown , that the transition of the hall system into the state described by the halperin wave function results in that the dependence of the velocity shift on the wave vector is modified quantitatively for certain nonuniform elastic modes .",
