    "the resilience to dephasing of the geometric phase of the no - jump trajectory found in refs .",

    "it is instructive to compare the preceding dephasing example with the mixed state geometric phase @xmath100 $ ] proposed in ref .",

    ", @xmath34 can be chosen to be hermitian for all open - system models that include lindblad operators that are linear combinations of the pauli operators with real coefficients , such as dephasing and depolarization .",
    "on the other hand , it should be stressed that if no @xmath3 exist such that @xmath34 becomes hermitian , then the shift in fact corresponds to a new hamiltonian that may cause a different evolution @xmath14 .",
    "one such example is spontaneous decay of a qubit , for which one can not find a nonzero @xmath65 such that @xmath101 becomes hermitian .",
    "indeed , the shift @xmath102 induces the zeeman term @xmath103 $ ] in the hamiltonian , in the case of spontaneous decay .",
    "another example is a spin@xmath4 system interacting with a quantized light field and subjected to a linear loss of photons .",
    "this loss may be modeled by the non - hermitian photon annihilation operator @xmath104 . in this case",
    ", the shift @xmath75 yields the extra term @xmath105 $ ] in the hamiltonian , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the ` position ' and ` momentum ' operators , respectively , of the quantized light field .",

    "applications of the quantum jump unraveling to these model systems have indeed shown a nontrivial error resilience @xcite , results that support the usefulness of the geometric phase for robust quantum computation .",
    "stochastic unravelings in the form of quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) @xcite consist of continuous , brownian - like quantum trajectories whose average coincides with the full lindblad evolution .",
    "the geometric phase of such trajectories arising from nonlinear @xcite and linear @xcite versions of the qsd equation has been considered in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",

    "we demonstrate this by an example , again the dephasing qubit model with real - valued and time - independent shift parameter @xmath65 and hamiltonian @xmath118 . for initial state @xmath119",

    "we have demonstrated the existence of markovian open - system evolutions for which the associated no - jump quantum trajectories may depend on parameters that are undetermined by the full open - system evolution .",
    "we have found conditions for this situation to occur and have identified the origin of this dependence in terms of continuous monitoring of the system s environment .",
    "furthermore , we have explicitly demonstrated how such a hidden parameter can be unveiled by the geometric phase of an individual quantum trajectory for a dephasing qubit .",
    "the realization of the geometric phase for single quantum trajectories requires explicit engineering of the system - environment interaction ; a feature that is shared by the mixed state geometric phases for completely positive maps proposed in ref .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that the averaged geometric phase introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite of the linearized qsd model shows a similar dependence on hidden parameters .",
    "thus , it remains open whether a well - defined open - system geometric phase based upon quantum trajectories exists .",
