    "aperture synthesis images , obtained using an interferometer with multiple baselines and closure phases , provide a much more assumption - free way to interpret interferometric data astrophysically than the simple fitting of models to single - baseline fringe amplitudes does .",
    "therefore , imaging capabilities will be of special importance for the upcoming generation of ground - based and space interferometers . in this paper , we present the results of an initial attempt to use the _ infrared optical telescope array _ ( iota ) for imaging in the near infrared .",
    "since this was to be the first effort to construct an image at iota , we decided that it was important to observe an object with a well known brightness structure in order to demonstrate the instrument s capabilities .",
    "therefore , we chose to observe the strongly resolved spectroscopic binary capella ( @xmath0 aurigae ) so that our maps could be compared to the results of earlier studies .",
    "the first spectroscopic measurements by  @xcite revealed the components capella aa and ab ( classified today as g8 iii and g1 iii @xcite ) .",
    "the system also became the first binary to be separated by an optical interferometer @xcite .",
    "the orbit was determined with high precision in 1994 using the mark iii interferometer by  @xcite . in 1996",
    "baldwin et al . presented the first optical ( @xmath10 nm ) aperture synthesis map of capella using the _ cambridge optical aperture synthesis telescope _ ( coast ) with a longest baseline of @xmath11 m .",
    "two years later young used the same instrument to map capella in the near infrared ( @xmath12 @xmath13 m ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "this 3-telescope interferometer located at fred whipple observatory atop mount hopkins , arizona , demonstrated first closure phases on 2002 february 25 .",
    "iota s telescopes can be moved on an l - shaped track and are mounted on stations @xmath20 m and @xmath21 m apart . with track lengths of 15 m ( south - east direction ) and 35 m ( north - east direction ) , baselines up to 38 m can be formed .",
    "the collecting optics consist of f/2.5 45 cm cassegrain primary mirrors , which are fed by siderostats .",
    "the atmospherically induced motion of the image is compensated by tip - tilt servo systems mounted behind the telescopes . passing various mirrors and path - compensating delay lines , the beams are deflected into the laboratory , where the infrared component of the beam is coupled onto the ionic3 pair - wise beam combiner @xcite .",
    "this combines the beams symmetrically with a ratio of 50:50 .    for each baseline",
    "the beam combination produces two complementary outputs which are simultaneously acquired by a picnic - camera  @xcite . using piezo scanners installed in two optical path delays , the optical path delay ( opd )",
    "can be modulated to scan temporally through the interference fringe pattern .",
    "each observation on the target object is completed by the acquisition of four calibration files .",
    "one of these files measures the camera background signal with the light from all telescopes shuttered out . for the other three files ,",
    "the light of two telescopes is shuttered out alternately .",
    "this allows us to measure the instrument transmission by determining the coefficients of the transfer  matrix ( @xmath19  matrix ,   * ? ? ?",
    "the observations presented in this paper were obtained at the iota between ut 2002 november 12 and 16 . during this time we made observations in two three - telescope configurations in order to obtain a reasonable sampling of the @xmath8 plane for the capella image .",
    "a log of the observations is presented in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "( see figure attached )    iota produces raw fringes by scanning the optical path delay through the position of the white light fringe in the instrument .",
    "the fringes which are observed must then be converted into visibilities and closure phases for imaging and model fitting .",
    "we have reduced the raw fringe data in a sequence of steps .",
    "an important first step is to locate the fringes within the raw data scans in order to determine the optical path delay in the iota system .",
    "if fringes are found , the next step is to calibrate photometric fluctuations due to atmospheric seeing . by using the transfer matrix , the coupling of the stars to the optical inputs of the beam combiner and the internal coupling of the beams within the combiner  @xcite",
    "are taken into accont as well .    in order to form a photometrically calibrated scan ,",
    "we make use of the fact that for the 3-beam pairwise combination scheme used the photometric information can be obtained for each measurement using linear combinations of the interferometric signals  ( similar to the procedure used by   * ? ? ?",
    "this requires a matrix inversion , which might be sensitive to numerical instabilities , especially in the case of low signal - to - noise ( @xmath22 ) . for this reason , we smooth the scan by convolving it with a gaussian before solving for the photometry for each individual pixel .",
    "the photometric calibration is performed for the two complementary signals of each baseline separately .",
    "remaining residuals are removed by subtracting the two complementary outputs for each baseline .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig : rawcwt ] illustrate how the data might look for different conditions after these basic data reduction steps .",
    "each observation at iota consists of measurements of hundreds of fringes obtained over a time period of a few minutes . typically , we have estimated visibilities and closure phases for each individual realization of a fringe and then averaged the results for many fringes to obtain the final result .      the scans through the white light fringe",
    "follow a particular functional form . assuming a bandwidth filter with idealized rectangular transmission , the instrumental response expected for a point source is given by the product of a sinc - envelope , with width inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the input signal , and a cosine function representing the interference fringes .",
    "the amplitude of the fringe envelope reflects the _",
    "raw visibility_. however , this measurement must be calibrated with observations of unresolved reference stars or stars of known diameter in order to remove instrumental and atmospheric effects .",
    "typically , each observation of a target source is bracketed by observations of unresolved stars to provide a calibration of the instrument . in this work ,",
    "all target observations are enclosed by at least one such calibration measurement on each side of the target observation .",
    "the results for the calibration stars are interpolated linearly to calibrate the raw visibilities for the interferometric efficiency of the system , yielding the _ calibrated target visibility_.    during our observation run we noticed a minor technical problem which became a dominating issue for data reduction : the scanning piezo mirrors showed a mechanical resonance ( see 3rd panel of figure  [ fig : rawcwt ] ) , resulting in multiple additional peaks within the power spectrum of the acquired scans .",
    "the data reduction procedure most commonly used by the interferometry community ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) estimates the visibility by integrating over the fringe peak within interferogram power spectra after averaging and background subtraction . to improve the visibility estimation for our resonance - influenced data , we implemented two alternative methods to estimate the visibility amplitude .",
    "+ since the interfering resonance only affects the internal structure of the fringes , we implemented a fringe envelope fitting ( fef ) algorithm which filters the peaks of the fringe packet .",
    "the position of these local minima and maxima is then fitted to the analytic sinc - envelope function with the envelope amplitude , the width , and the position as fitting parameters . for low @xmath22",
    "this algorithm tends to overestimate the fringe amplitude .",
    "analyzing the resulting bias by simulating fringes with additive gaussian noise , we found a bias on the fitted fringe amplitude which depends exponentially on the noise .",
    "based on these simulations we were able to correct the fitted visibilities down to @xmath23 .",
    "motivated by  @xcite , we also implemented a data reduction procedure based on the continous wavelet transform ( cwt ) . in multiscale analysis ,",
    "the time signal is decomposed into the two - dimensional time - frequency space by measuring the response of a translated and scaled mother - wavelet function to the measured signal .",
    "compared to the fourier transform ( ft ) , which is based on periodical sinusoidal waves , the use of a localized mother wavelet allows the precise localization of the power within the signal  @xcite . for the mother wavelet , we used the morlet function , which is given by a sinusoidal multiplied with a gaussian and therefore similar to the analytic fringe function as noted above .",
    "the absolute square of the complex wavelet function defines the wavelet spectral density spectrum .    from this density spectrum ,",
    "we remove all features below a particular significance level ( e.g. @xmath24 scaled to the peak ) . resonance ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rawcwt ] ) or an uncompensated change in piston during the fringe scan might result in several non - connected areas .",
    "therefore , we run a filling algorithm which removes all regions which are not connected to the area containing the main signal .",
    "the integral over the remaining region is used as an estimate of the fringe power .    the measured width of the remaining region in the opd and scale domain",
    "is then compared to the expected width and used as a selection criteria to reject scans with a high piston . even for good scans ,",
    "the cwt is contaminated by additive noise . to determine the level of this noise , we integrate in the cwt along the opd axis towards both directions , starting @xmath25 m from the border of the fringe region .",
    "the extend of this noise region along the scale axis is given by the extend of the fringe peak region .",
    "this averaged background noise level is subtracted from the fringe power .",
    "noticing that the cwt is a non - linear transformation , we confirmed the proper behavior of our algorithm by performing extensive simulations .",
    "the visibilities obtained with the fef and cwt algorithm are in good agreement , even if the cwt algorithm seems to be superior for cases with low @xmath22 .",
    "the accuracy of the measured visibilities is limited primarily by calibration . for error estimation",
    "we include , beside the statistical errors for each data set , a calibration error for each night which was estimated by the scattering of the calibrator visibilities during that particular night . for good seeing conditions",
    "this calibration error @xmath26 is typically around @xmath27 ( 2002nov12 - 15 ) , while for worse conditions it may rise to @xmath28 ( 2002nov16 ) .",
    "since we are observing on the three baselines @xmath29 simultaneously , the fringe phases @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 can be measured .",
    "simultaneous measurement of three phases in turn allows a new quantity , the closure phase @xmath33 ( cp , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to be estimated .",
    "the cp has enormous value since it is unaffected by atmospheric propagation effects , and through measurements of cp and visibility amplitudes , it is possible to create aperture synthesis images . in the following",
    "we briefly describe our methods for estimating this essential interferometric observable .",
    "the estimation of cp begins with the location of the fringes for each baseline within the raw scans .",
    "the phase of each fringe must be determined within the same temporal window within the scan in order to assure that all phases are measured at the same time and within the coherence time of the atmosphere .",
    "thus , we locate the median delay for the centers of the three fringe packets and determine the phase of each baseline within a short window of width @xmath34 m centered on that opd .",
    "the ft of the windowed fringe results in a strong peak at the frequency of the fringe . in the iota three - baseline system ,",
    "the frequencies of these peaks for the three fringes obey a `` closure '' relationship such that @xmath35 , and if this relationship is not obeyed by the data , then there is a good chance that one or more of the peaks is spurious .",
    "for these reasons , we reject scans which do not obey this frequency closure relation . for scans that do pass this test",
    ", we may then use the phases of the ft s for the three fringes to compute the cp : @xmath36 .",
    "unresolved calibrators , for which the cp is known to be zero , are used to define the instrumental cp - offset .",
    "using the above algorithm , we have estimated closure phases for all of the observations obtained during our run . from the scattering of the calibrator cp over the individual nights",
    "we include calibration errors @xmath37 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 . under good seeing conditions , the iota / ionic3 instrument is able to measure cp with high precision with systematic errors of the order of @xmath40 or less . as a conservative value",
    "we assume @xmath41 .",
    "after presenting the details of our procedures for visibility and cp estimation , we want to investigate a potential influence of the _ bandwidth smearing effect _ on our data .    for extended sources , this effect will reduce the complex degree of coherence at those points of the brightness distribution that are separated in delay from zero optical path delay @xmath42 by amounts comparable to the width of the fringe packet . as a consequence",
    ", the detailed instrumental response will be more complicated than the point - source response .",
    "thus , estimation of visibilities and closure phases using the point source response as a template could lead to some systematic errors .    for a rectangular spectral bandpass profile ,",
    "the complex degree of coherence @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 to estimate the loss of coherence for a particular projected baseline @xmath45 , the _ coherent field of view _",
    "@xmath46 can be defined as the angular separation for which the fringe of an off - axis point source will be centered right on the first zero point of the fringe envelope of the on - axis point source . in this case",
    ", just half of the fringe power from both sources will overlap .",
    "using equation  [ eqn : degcoh ] , we obtain @xmath47 mas for our longest baseline used ( ab on the nights of ut2002nov12 - 14 ) .",
    "the comparison with the separation of the capella stars ( @xmath48 mas ) shows that we just reach the limit where bandwidth smearing might play a role .",
    "since in the regime of marginal bandwidth smearing the contrast decreases with distance from zero opd in a well - defined way , a correction can be applied . in the given case we correct the visibility @xmath49 of a uniformly bright disk of diameter @xmath50 .",
    "assuming totally coherent combination , @xmath51 can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the bessel function of first kind and first order .    to determine the delay - affected visibility @xmath54",
    ", we define @xmath55 in the case of a binary star with two uds of diameter @xmath56 and @xmath57 the resulting interferogram is given by the composition of two fringes with different delays @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "since the delay at which the combined fringe is evaluated depends on the brightness ratio of the individual fringes , it is appropriate to evaluate the two correction factors relative to an effective delay @xmath60 , given by the center of intensity of the combined fringe packet : @xmath61    the fact , that our procedure for closure phase estimation does not measure the phases over the whole fringe packet could be of advantage in the regime of marginal bandwidth smearing . as described in chapter  [ cha : estcp ] , we measure the phases within a narrow temporal window around the center of the composite fringe where the interferograms overlap properly .",
    "making use of the expression for the visibility of a delay - affected ud , the complex visibility @xmath62 of a close binary system with a position vector @xmath63 can be written as @xmath64 with @xmath65 for the baseline vector and the wave number @xmath66 . in strictly formal notation ,",
    "an additional overall phase factor appears on the right - hand side of equation  [ eqn : visbinary ] . since this phase factor merely moves the fringe pattern underneath the envelope it neither effects the visibility nor the cp and",
    "can be neglected .",
    "we performed least square model fits , equally weighting @xmath67 individual visibility and @xmath68 cp measurements with @xmath69 with the model visibilities @xmath70 and closure phases @xmath71 calculated from the complex visibility : @xmath72 the errors for the individual measurements are @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the model for capella included the relative positions of the stars , the stellar diameters , and the ratio of the total fluxes from the two stars .    given our limited dataset , the capella model contains parameters with significant correlations , which makes it difficult to extract all parameters simultaneously .",
    "therefore , we proceeded to estimate the model parameters in an iterative manner , starting without delay - compensated visibilities ( using @xmath51 instead of @xmath54 in equation  [ eqn : visbinary ] ) . in the first step , the stars were assumed to be point sources and the fit solved for the relative positions and fluxes .",
    "the next step was to fit the residuals to this model fit and determine the stellar diameters .",
    "the process continued iteratively , using the derived diameters to find relative fluxes and positions followed by a new estimation of the diameters .",
    "this process converged typically within a few iterations .",
    "finally , we applied the delay - compensation to obtain the fit results for each individual night as given in table  [ tab : fitresults ] and fig .",

    "in some cases , the reduced @xmath126 values exceed unity , which might be a result of bad seeing , a potentially uncorrected bias due to the effect of bandwidth smearing , the piezo scanner resonances , or other undiscovered systematic errors . however , the measurements are clearly in good agreement with the high precision reference orbit by  @xcite obtained with two telescopes on the mark iii interferometer .",

    "stellar radii measurements are of special importance as the most direct way to determine stellar effective temperatures .",
    "the stellar radii , derived from our @xmath1-band data , are in good agreement with the measurements at visible wavelengths by  @xcite . as a result of our longer effective wavelength and the smaller amount of data",
    ", we can not exceed the precision of their extensive study .",
    "therefore , we skip re - calculating the effective temperatures with our values .",
    "+        in the exploratory spirit of the present capella imaging work , we have investigated three different imaging algorithms , as explained here .",
    "the radio astronomy community has developed various algorithms to reconstruct phase information from cp , most notably conventional hybrid mapping ( chm , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and difference mapping ( dfm ) by @xcite . in both algorithms ,",
    "the individual phases are recovered by self - calibration @xcite .",
    "the necessary deconvolutions can be performed with the classical clean algorithm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have also tested the `` building - block mapping '' ( bbm ) algorithm presented by  @xcite , which was originally developed to reconstruct images from speckle - bispectrum data . here",
    ", the image is build up by adding iteratively point - like components ( building blocks ) to an image in order to minimize the least square distance between the measured bispectrum and the bispectrum of the reconstructed image .",
    "since the computation of this distance function for each potential position of the next building block ( the whole image space ) is computationally too expensive , a linear approximation of the least square distance is applied .",
    "the main assumption of this approximation is that the added component changes the bispectrum of the reconstructed image only insignificantly . for details of this method ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in order to allow a comparison of the results obtained with the various methods , we implemented all algorithms within one software framework .",
    "this allows us to start all image reconstruction methods with precisely the same initial conditions .      to demonstrate that the data and mapping techniques were sensitive to the movement of the stars during the observation period",
    ", we subdivided our data into three subsets ( 2002nov12 - 13 , 2002nov14 , 2002nov15 - 16 ) , each one still containing enough data for mapping . since we observed during the first two epochs with the telescope configuration including the longest baseline ( and hereby missing lower frequencies ) , the convergence of the bbm maps had to be supported by limiting the reconstruction area . within the maps generated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mapmotion ] ) it is perceivable that the orbital motion can clearly be traced accurately .",
    "also the intensity of the stars ( from left to right : @xmath131 1.6 , 1.7 , 1.6 ) can be estimated reliably .",
    "the key goal of our project was to produce aperture synthesis images of capella in order to demonstrate the capabilities of iota / ionic3 .",
    "however , observations were obtained over five nights , during which time the relative positions of the binary pair changed by many milliarcseconds . in order to make a single map with data from all nights , and",
    "thereby improve the @xmath8 coverage available for the map , we applied a coodinate transformation to compensate for the orbital motion of the binary components over the observed time interval .",
    "thus , the fringe spacing is rescaled to account for the changing separation of the stars , and the orientation of the fringes on the sky is reoriented to account for the changing position angle of the binary pair . each @xmath8 point",
    "was transformed in this manner to a new coordinate system corresponding to the geometry of the stars at the time of the middle of our observation run .",
    "this way , all observations may be combined to produce a single map with improved @xmath8 coverage .",
    "of course , the above procedure is only strictly justified for special circumstances . in a binary system",
    ", the stars would have to rotate synchronously and any brightness structure on each star would have to be stationary during the time of observation . in the capella system , we note that this procedure might be justified for the cooler aa component , which has been found to rotate synchronously to the orbital motion  @xcite .",
    "the infrared - fainter ab component rotates asynchronously , hence it would not be possible to map structure onto this more active star .",
    "the resulting chm , dfm and bbm maps are presented in fig .  [ fig : maps ] . for",
    "the given , sufficient simple brightness source distribution , all algorithms converged without any concrete trial model assumptions or other specific pre - suppositions .",
    "as an initial phase estimate we set two of the three phases equal to zero , thus the third phase was given by the closure phase relation .",
    "the intensity ratios @xmath132 measured within the maps are 1.9 ( chm ) , 1.6 ( dfm ) , and 1.8 ( bbm ) .    a quantitative comparison between the bbm map in fig .  [ fig : maps ] and the maps constructed from the data subsets as described in chapter  [ cha : mapsubset ] reveals that the rotation compensating coordinate transformation clearly reduced the noise content within the maps and also improved the convergence behaviour .",
    "since the stellar surfaces within the maps are partially resolved , one can measure the stellar diameters .",
    "this provides values of @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( measured within the unconvolved bbm map ) , which is in good agreement with our model fitting results .",
    "by observing the well - studied capella system we were able to demonstrate the overall performance and imaging capabilities of the iota / ionic3 instrument .",
    "iota was able to successfully measure and calibrate visibility amplitudes and closure phases , even with a temporary but significant instrumental problem that affected the raw data adversely during this run .",
    "the visibility amplitudes and closure phases were then used with three algorithms to reconstruct reliable images of this well known binary system .",
    "thus , the primary goal of this experiment has been achieved , and the iota facility has been shown to be a powerful tool for high - resolution infrared imaging .        , j.  e. , beckett , m.  g. , boysen , r.  c. , burns , d. , buscher , d.  f. , cox , g.  c. , haniff , c.  a. , mackay , c.  d. , nightingale , n.  s. , rogers , j. , scheuer , p.  a.  g. , scott , t.  r. , tuthill , p.  g. , warner , p.  j. , wilson , d.  m.  a. , and wilson , r.  w. : 1996 , , l13 +    , j. , haguenauer , p. , kern , p.  y. , rousselet - perraut , k. , malbet , f. , gluck , s. , lagny , l. , schanen - duport , i. , laurent , e. , delboulbe , a. , tatulli , e. , traub , w.  a. , carleton , n. , millan - gabet , r. , monnier , j.  d. , and pedretti , e. : 2003 , in _",

    "<S> we present infrared aperture synthesis maps produced with the upgraded iota interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> michelson interferograms on the close binary system capella ( @xmath0 aur ) were obtained in the @xmath1-band between 2002 november 12 and 16 using the ionic3 beam combiner . with baselines of @xmath2 m @xmath3 m </S>",
    "<S> , we were able to determine the relative position of the binary components with milliarcsecond ( mas ) precision and to track their movement along the @xmath4 arc covered by our observation run . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly describe the algorithms used for visibility and closure phase estimation . </S>",
    "<S> three different hybrid mapping and bispectrum fitting techniques were implemented within one software framework and used to reconstruct the source brightness distribution . by dividing our data into subsets , </S>",
    "<S> the system could be mapped at three epochs , revealing the motion of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> the precise position of the binary components was also determined with model fits , which in addition revealed @xmath5 and apparent stellar uniform - disk ( ud ) diameters of @xmath6 mas and @xmath7 mas .    to improve the @xmath8-plane coverage </S>",
    "<S> , we compensated this orbital motion by applying a rotation - compensating coordinate transformation . the resulting model - independent map with a beam size of @xmath9 mas allows the resolution of the stellar surfaces of the capella giants themselves . </S>"
