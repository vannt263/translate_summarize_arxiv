    "the possibility to use the two - photon pair production for luminosity measurements at hadron colliders was first considered in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the cross section of the process @xmath4 for the forward region can be calculated within qed with an accuracy of 1% or better allowing for a precise luminosity determination using the number of events observed and the calculated cross section : @xmath5 .",
    "the method suggested in @xcite provides for both the high rate monitoring and the absolute luminosity measurements but requires a dedicated apparatus allowing for the @xmath6-pair detection in the pseudorapidity range of @xmath7 5 and capable of the @xmath8 measurements with the accuracy of a few mev .",
    "this approach has never been used .",
    "the kinematic domain of the central rapidity pairs is much more attractive from the experimental point of view though the corresponding cross section is smaller and some additional theoretic uncertainties appear .",
    "the application of the centrally produced @xmath6-pairs with @xmath9 gev for luminosity measurements at lhc with atlas was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the detail study of the trigger issues and the background conditions has shown that using of @xmath0 with high-@xmath8 muons looks favorable .",
    "due to the high @xmath8 threshold of lhc experiments ( @xmath10 1 gev ) , the cross section of @xmath0 is small ( @xmath11 pb ) therefore this process can not be used for the luminosity monitoring but provides for the absolute calibration of any stable high - rate monitor with the statistical accuracy of 1 @xmath1 2 % after of a few months operation .    below the proposal for the atlas offline luminosity determination using the two - photon production of @xmath12-pairs @xcite",
    "is reported and the preliminary signal and background cross section estimates for the lhcb detector are presented .",
    "it should be mentioned that the application of the forward @xmath6-pairs is under study in atlas @xcite .",
    "the possibility to employ @xmath13 for luminosity measurements was manifested in @xcite without a detail consideration of theoretical uncertainties and detector related questions .",
    "a review of the two - photon leptoproduction can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "main features of this process can be illustrated in the equivalent photon approximation ( e.p.a . ) allowing one to express its cross section via the cross section of the pair production by virtual photons with the equivalent photon spectra [ s ] d= _ ^*^ * ll dn_1 dn_2 for colliding leptons one has @xcite [ n ] dn_qed = ( 1 - ) = where @xmath14 is the four - momentum of the virtual photon and @xmath15 is the lorentz factor of the colliding particle ( we assume @xmath16 ) .",
    "the cutoff of the spectrum ( [ n ] ) occurs at @xmath17 due to the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the invariant mass of the pair produced ) . the characteristic value of the the total transverse momentum of the pair produced @xmath21 10 mev in the luminosity measurements context .",
    "when @xmath22 collide , the proton can dissociate during the photon emission therefore the elastic and the inelastic two - photon processes should be distinguished .    in the elastic case fig .",
    "( [ fig : fgs],a ) only the small modification of the equivalent photon spectrum is required : [ nel ] dn_el = dn_qed ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the electromagnetic form factors ) .    for the inelastic processes fig .",
    "( [ fig : fgs],b ) , ( [ fig : fgs],c ) one has for each inelastic vertex @xcite [ ninel ] dn_inel = dn_qed dm^2 dn_qed dm^2 where @xmath25 is the invariant mass of the hadronic system , @xmath26 is the inelastic scattering structure function and @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the @xmath29 cross sections known from the photo- and electro - production experiments . unlike ( [ n ] ) and ( [ nel ] ) , the expression ( [ ninel ] ) is not singular for @xmath30 thus the characteristic pair @xmath8 for the inelastic production is not small ( @xmath31 250 mev ) .",
    "diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : fgs ] reflect the strong interaction inside the single proton , besides , the strong interaction between colliding protons , so called _ rescattering _ , should be taken into account ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rescat ] ) .    in the atlas luminosity measurement context",
    ", the rescattering has been considered in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the elastic strong interaction fig .",
    "( [ fig : rescat],b ) just modifies the phase of the matrix element and does not change the cross section . the inelastic strong interaction fig .",
    "( [ fig : rescat],c ) reduces the yield of @xmath0 on behalf of @xmath32 . in the experimental setup when only the muon pair is detected",
    ", the total dimuon cross section remains unchanged . to reduce the dimuon background from drell - yan process and",
    "the hadron decays , the absence of extra particles in the dimuon vertex is necessary . in this case    _ ^pp x + = _ ^el + _ inel _ ^inel - ( 1-_rescat ) _ ^rescat where @xmath33 are the probabilities that the event passes the vertex cut ; for lhcb and atlas @xmath34 .",
    "the first two terms can be estimated using the e.p.a .",
    "formulae [ sel ] d_^el = dn_el,1 dn_el,2 _ ^+^- [ sinel ] d_^inel = ( dn_el,1 dn_inel,2 + dn_inel,1 dn_el,2 + dn_inel,1 dn_inel,2 ) _ ^+^- @xmath35 for the pair mass @xmath36 gev in absence of cuts on the total pair @xmath8 .    the @xmath37 can not be expressed in terms of the equivalent photon spectra .",
    "numerically , @xmath38 of @xmath39 for @xmath8(pair ) @xmath40 30 mev @xcite .    the m.c .",
    "calculations performed by us for the atlas conditions has demonstrated that @xmath41 and its dependence of on the pair @xmath8 is similar to that of @xmath42 .",
    "so , it causes no additional problems for the luminosity measurements .",
    "below we include the rescattering effect in the inelastic cross section .",
    "it should be noted that the rescattering for the inelastic diagrams ( [ fig : fgs],b ) , ( [ fig : fgs],c ) is not considered in @xcite and is ignored in our cross section calculations .",
    "this and the bad knowledges of the soft inelastic scattering structure functions make the inelastic cross section estimates rather uncertain .    for the forward @xmath44-pair production the smallness of the pair mass @xmath20 ensures the smallness of @xmath18 and makes the inelastic contribution negligible as was stated in @xcite .",
    "the situation is not so simple concerning the muon pair production with @xmath45 6 gev and @xmath46 12 gev . in this case",
    "the inelastic background is not negligible even with severe experimental cuts ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pt ] ) .    however , the distributions of the pair @xmath8 and related variables are very different allowing one to reduce the background to an acceptable level and then subtract it as described below .",
    "the uncertainty in the residual inelastic contribution is about 30% , @xmath47 3% of the visible signal , does not affect the luminosity measurement due to the background subtraction .",
    "the accuracy of the elastic signal calculation @xmath48 0.5% is limited by the accuracy of the proton form factors only .",
    "the formulae ( [ sel ] ) , ( [ sinel ] ) are presented above just for the illustration .",
    "the actual calculations were performed using the event generator @xcite implementing the exact lowest order matrix element .",
    "the muon bremsstrahlung , affecting the essential parameter distributions , was simulated in the soft photon approximation ; other types of radiative corrections were not applied .",
    "it seems sufficient for the current stage of the work .",
    "the following criteria are proposed for the atlas event selection :    1 .   two muon tracks of opposite charges ( measured in both the inner detector and the muon spectrometer and triggered by the muon systems ) with @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 ; 2 .",
    "muon pair invariant mass @xmath51 gev ( against @xmath52 ) ; 3 .",
    "@xmath8 of the muons are equal within 2.5@xmath53 of the measurement uncertainty ( @xmath54 1.5% for @xmath55 20 gev ) ; 4 .",
    "acollinearity angle @xmath56",
    "so the muons are not exactly back - to - back ( against the cosmic ray background ) ; 5 .",
    "probability of @xmath57 for the muon vertex fit ; 6 .",
    "no other charged tracks with @xmath58 gev , @xmath59 , @xmath60 mm and a good @xmath61 from the muon vertex ( @xmath62 is the estimated error in @xmath63 for the nearest point to the beam ) .",
    "the condition ( 6 ) strongly reduces the background from drell yan process and hadron decays but makes the detection efficiency dependent on the event pile - up probability . for the longitudinal lhc bunch size of 7.5 cm and the luminosity @xmath64 ,",
    "the loss of two - photon events is about 3% .    the expected acoplanarity distribution for selected events in shown in fig . [ fig : phi ] .",
    "( the acoplanarity angle @xmath65 is defined as the angle between the muon production planes ) .",
    "the simulation was performed using the particle level monte carlo code @xcite with the detector properties parameterized according to the atlas specification .",
    "the signal and background cross section estimates for the reference region @xmath66 5 mrad containing about 50% of the signal are presented in table [ tab : mm ] .",
    "the acoplanarity distribution has the sharp signal peak at @xmath67 and is almost uniform for background processes in the range of @xmath68 50 mrad . unlike the distribution of the pair transverse momentum ,",
    "it is not much affected by the detector resolution . using this ,",
    "the final signal extraction can be performed by fitting the @xmath65 distribution in the range of @xmath69 mrad with the signal shape obtained by monte carlo and the symmetric parabolic background @xmath70 .    .atlas cross section estimates for the kinematic cuts ( 1 - 4 ) and all cuts ( the expected detection efficiency @xmath10 0.65 is not taken into account ) . [",
    "tab : mm ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     due to lower @xmath8 threshold , the estimated lhcb signal cross section is more than 10 times larger then that for atlas .",
    "the statistical accuracy of 1% seems reachable at the designed luminosity of @xmath71 .    by the same reason the variation of the background level in the background subtraction interval @xmath72 mrad is bigger than for atlas .",
    "some optimization of cuts might be necessary to keep the systematic error small .",
