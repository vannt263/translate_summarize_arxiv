    "note that the non  mesonic processes can also be mediated by the exchange of mesons more massive than the pion .",
    "several important experimental advances in nmwd study have been made in recent years , which have established more precise values of the neutron and proton  induced decay rates @xmath26 and @xmath10 , solving in this way the long  standing puzzle on the @xmath26/@xmath10 ratio @xcite .    despite this progress",
    ", one should observe that no experimental evidence has been obtained yet of the two  nucleon stimulated decay , with the exception of two indirect results @xcite .",
    "various theoretical papers were dedicated to the calculation of the rates and the nucleon spectra for this mechanism @xcite , predicting a significant contribution to nmwd .",
    "the first calculation of the two  nucleon induced decay rates was performed within a nuclear matter scheme introducing a phenomenological description of the two  particle two  hole polarization propagator @xcite .",

    "in particular , a very recent contribution @xcite studied the effects of pauli exchange terms in the two  nucleon stimulated nmwd , thus giving more reliable evaluations of @xmath21 and @xmath12 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     let us now consider the low energy rise in the proton spectra , which we consider to be due to the combined contributions of fsi and two  nucleon induced nmwd . if it were due to fsi effects , one should naturally expect that the structure at 80 mev should still exist , but reduced as number of events since a fraction of them would be degraded in energy and contribute to the low energy part of the spectra . by straightforward arguments",
    "we may assume that the number of protons suffering a fsi should increase linearly with @xmath56 and then the related amount of events in the tail due to fsi .",
    "+ the additional mechanism that could explain the low energy behaviour is a contribution of the two  nucleon induced nmwd ; if the energy released in the weak decay is shared by three nucleons , a low energy rise may show up even for hypernuclei as light as @xmath6 .",
    "this contribution to the nmwd should be assumed , as first hypothesis , as independent on ( or slowly dependent on ) @xmath56 .",
    "theoretical calculations @xcite support such a constancy of @xmath57 for a wide hypernuclear mass range . +",
    "a way of disentangling between the two mechanisms is that of studying the behaviour of the low energy tail as a fuction of @xmath56 as we will describe in the following .    to estimate the contribution of two ",
    "nucleon induced nmwd we first assume that the part of proton spectrum beyond the peak mean value at about 80 mev is due to protons coming from the @xmath58 reaction and that the two  nucleon induced channel can be neglected in this region .",
    "this assumption is confirmed by theoretical calculations , which estimated that beyond 70 mev the protons from the two  nucleon stimulated decay are about @xmath59 of the total number of two  nucleon induced decay protons @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the part of spectrum below the peak mean value is due to protons from both @xmath58 and two  nucleon induced decays .    as pointed out before fsi also affects the spectra .",
    "let us then denote with @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) the difference between the number of protons detected in the region below ( beyond ) the peak of the spectrum and the ( unknown ) number of primary protons which originates from one and two  nucleon induced weak decays in the same region .",
    "available calculations @xcite predict that @xmath60 is a positive quantity while @xmath61 is negative : fsi tends to remove protons from the high energy part of the spectrum while filling the low energy region .    according to the above assumptions and definitions , for the total number of protons @xmath62 in the low energy region ( below the center of the peak ) and @xmath63 in the high energy region ( beyond the center of the peak ; blue filled areas in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) of the spectra we thus have : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total number of @xmath66 decays ( which we assume to be evenly distributed in the gaussian peak , i.e. , half in @xmath62 and half in @xmath63 ) and @xmath67 is the total number of @xmath68 decays ( which occur only in @xmath62 ) contributing to the spectra .",
    "one can also write : @xmath69 note that in eq .",
    "( [ as ] ) and in the last equality of eq  .([number - gamma ] ) the two  nucleon induced nmwd has been assumed to be dominated by the @xmath68 channel : @xmath70 ( the recent microscopical calculation of ref .  @xcite obtained @xmath71 ) .",
    "consider now the ratio : @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the experimental values of this ratio are plotted as a function of @xmath56 . due to fsi effects , both @xmath62 and @xmath63 given by eqs .",
    "( [ as ] ) and ( [ as2 ] ) are expected to be proportional to @xmath56 : one can thus perform a fit of the data of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with a function @xmath73 . from this fit",
    "it turns out that @xmath74 , thus a linear fit , @xmath75 , can be considered .",
    "the result of such a fit ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) is shown in fig .",
    "+ now , we note that we can write @xmath79 . since theory and experiment support the indipendence of @xmath80 @xcite and @xmath81 @xcite on @xmath56",
    ", we may assume that @xmath82 is constant .",

    "the final result can thus be given by the weighted average : @xmath86    to determine @xmath9/@xmath21 we need to know the @xmath26/@xmath10 ratio .",
    "indeed : @xmath87 theoretical calculations @xcite predict @xmath26/@xmath10 values between @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90he and @xmath91 and recent experimental results @xcite give : @xmath92 ) for @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) for @xmath91 . to determine a unique value of @xmath26/@xmath10 that could be reasonable for all the studied hypernuclei , we take the weighted average of the two cited experimental results , @xmath95 ) . using this value together with our determination of @xmath82",
    "we obtain : @xmath96    one may wonder that the above value  ( [ a9 ] ) is affected by the experimental threshold of 15 mev .",
    "however it was shown @xcite that proton spectra from two - nucleon induced nmwd , having a three body like phase space distribution , are almost vanishing below 15 mev .",
    "on the contrary the proton spectra from fsi have a monotonic increase going down in energy . than we expect that the threshold at 15 mev does not substantially affect the final value of @xmath12 .",
    "the value derived for the @xmath12 ratio supports both theoretical predictions @xcite and the latest experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which claim a large contribution of the two  nucleon induced channel to the total nmwd rate .",
    "however , the value obtained for @xmath12 suggests a smaller contribution than what quoted by bhang et al .",
    "@xcite , that for @xmath97c reported a contribution of the two  nucleon induced process as large as @xmath98 of the total nmwd width .",
    "we remark that this value was inferred from the fit of a kek proton spectrum measured with good statistics but poor energy resolution .",
    "the kek spectrum is quite different from the one reported here .",
    "experimental reasons for such a discrepancy are discussed in ref .",
    "we reported a systematic study , performed by the finuda experiment , of the proton kinetic energy spectra following the nmwd of @xmath13hypernuclei in the @xmath99 mass range .",
    "+ taking advantage of the low kinetic energy threshold for proton detection ( 15 mev ) and of the large mass number range of the studied hypernuclei , an evaluation of the nucleon fsi effects and of the two  nucleon induced decay contribution to the decay process was performed . + a linear dependence of fsi on the hypernuclear mass number @xmath56 was found and an experimental value of the ratio @xmath100 ) was determined for the first time .",
    "this result provides a clear experimental indication of the relevant rle played by the two  nucleon induced mode in the nmwd of hypernuclei : this channel contributes to about 24@xmath101 of the @xmath102 for the studied hypernuclei .",
