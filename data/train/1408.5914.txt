    "we use the first and second dielectric layers with conductive layers as follows : 0.98@xmath104m - thin @xmath181 dielectric layer ( @xmath182 = 6 , @xmath183 = 1 , @xmath184 ) , 1.83@xmath104m - thin @xmath110 dielectric layer ( @xmath182 = 2 , @xmath183 = 1 , @xmath184 ) , and 2nm - thin @xmath185 nanogrid conductive oxide layer with void structures ( @xmath182 = 100 , @xmath183 = 1 , @xmath179 = 2.8s / m ) are defined at the microwave regime .",
    "the void structures reducing vortex - induced loss have a lower effective conductive loss depending on the ratio of voids as given in eq .",
    "( [ maxwell - garnett ] ) .",
    "the conductivity @xmath179 of @xmath185 layer without void structures is estimated as 28s / m  @xcite .",
    "the simulation results for the reduced q - factors of a thin - film lumped - element smr with the mpls is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_q_factor ] ; the q - factor with no mpl is @xmath186 with the sapphire substrate ( @xmath187 ) , and we assume that this q - factor includes an intrinsic dielectric loss and an intrinsic tls dissipation .",
    "we note that the mpl with @xmath188 gives a still large q - factor @xmath189 , that does nt decrease the performance of the smr .",
    "in addition ,",
    "the increased effective conductivity of the mpl from 0 to 28s / m slightly reduces a resonant frequency by a couple hundred khz , but dielectric pairs of the mpl on the interface inductor increases a resonant frequency much from 6.22ghz ( without mpl ) to 6.95ghz .",
    "the separate simulation shows that the increased volume of the mpl ( @xmath179 = 2.8s / m , @xmath190 , @xmath191 ) from @xmath192 to @xmath193 reduces the q - factor from @xmath194 to @xmath195 due to the increased overlapping volume between the mpl and the cavity mode .",
    "we have proposed the mpl to protect a lumped - element smr against the multiband spectrum of photons and bbr and realize a hybrid quantum system with the evanescent field atom trap .",
    "the hybrid quantum system should maintain a high q - factor of the smr with low dissipations in the single - photon regime .",
    "surface - scattered nir photons and absorption - induced broadband mir bbr by the evanescent field atom trap reduce a q - factor due to optically- and thermally - excited quasiparticles .",
    "the mpl was designed to suppress both quasiparticles on the interface inductor , and the floated shielding structure to protect capacitors and other inductors .",
    "we also estimated the reduced q - factors from several types of the mpls by finite element method with a realistic tls loss tangent range in the single - photon regime .",
    "the mpl with a thin nanogrid conductive dielectric layer is an optimal solution for two - color nir photons and a broadband mir bbr , maintaining @xmath196 q - factor with dissipations for the single - photon operation .",
    "the evanescent field atom trap such as a waveguide / nanofiber was considered for the design of the mpl .",
    "compared to a nanofiber , a waveguide induces much lower absorption - induced bbr due to good heat conduction but higher surface - scattered photons due to its surface roughness .",
    "compared to a waveguide , a nanofiber induces lower surface - scattered photons due to good surface roughness but higher absorption - induced bbr due to low heat conduction .",
    "based on the validation of a hybrid quantum system , @xmath196 q - factor necessitates @xmath197 trapped atoms , and the trapped atom number might be possible for ultracold atoms but would be challenging for cold atoms , loading into the evanescent field atom trap .",
    "our mpl scheme can be adjusted in general depending on nir and mir spectrums and be a practical solution to reduce quasiparticle dissipations in a lumped - element smr .",

    "can be expressed as @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the two - spin density of states , and @xmath204 is the kinetic inductance fraction . a smr with a bigger @xmath205 and a higher @xmath206 becomes more protective against the quasiparticle dissipation .",
    "based on mattis - bardeen theory , quasiparticles can be diffused and recombined in a smr . the quasiparticle dissipation can be generated from thermal excitation @xmath207 and optical excitation @xmath208 .",

    "for a high @xmath211 at the steady state , the quasiparticle density is proportional to @xmath213 , where the light - induced density exceeds the thermal background .",
    "the allowable power was measured by a fiber - coupled nir photons on a lumped - element smr  @xcite .",
    "since inductors are sensitive to quasiparitcles due to kinetic inductance , the allowable power is proportional to the inductor area .",
    "the mpl improves the protection capability against quasiparticle dissipation with a floated shielding structure , and the allowable power increases . in consideration of the allowable power ,",
    "thermally excited quasiparticles are similar to optically excited quasiparticles .",
    "the main source of tls dissipation is hydrogen impurities forming @xmath214 bonds near metal - vacuum boundary or at interfaces between a thin - film and a substrate  @xcite .",
    "the tls dissipation of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator  @xcite was studied at milikelvin temperature . below a critical power ,",
    "the tls loss rate becomes power independent , and for a fixed power the loss rate increases significantly with decreasing temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence reflects the occupation difference of the energy levels of the tlss .",
    "the tls loss rate  @xcite is expressed as : @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the tls density of states with a fluctuating dipole moment @xmath217 ; @xmath218 is the filling factor of the tlss hosting medium ; @xmath219 ; @xmath220 is the rabi frequency proportional to the electric field @xmath221 ; @xmath222 and @xmath223 are the relaxation times of tlss .",
    "a low power regime , @xmath224 , is independent of the power dependence , @xmath225 , which increases a loss rate , but a power beyond a low power limit ( @xmath226 ) decreases a loss rate due to the power dependence .",
    "a low temperature , @xmath227 , increases a loss rate . a high temperature , but @xmath228 , decreases a loss rate due to the temperature dependence of @xmath229 . for the realization of a hybrid quantum system ,",
    "we need a low power and low temperature regime which is sensitive to tls dissipation .",
    "it is well known that optical losses in waveguides consist of material ( both intrinsic and extrinsic ) absorption , rayleigh scattering , and waveguide imperfections  @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic absorption of a nanophotonic atom trap is a heat source because the small mode area of the nanophotonic waveguide makes localized and intense bbr source in the near field .",
    "compared to a nanofiber atom trap  @xcite , the local equilibrium temperature of the ridge waveguide can be lower due to its large substrate area and close thermal - contact with 3.5k cooling stage .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic absorption , the waveguide imperfections contribute direct illumination to a smr underneath , while extrinsic absorption and rayleigh scattering can be relatively small due to smooth surface morphology by the state - of - the - art plasma - enhanced chemical - vapour deposition ( pecvd ) system or low - pressure chemical vapour deposition ( lpcvd ) system .",
    "intrinsic absorption is expected to be slightly higher than silica fiber ( @xmath2300.5db / km  @xcite ) used in modern optical communication system because of the lower bandgap of @xmath75  @xcite . assuming that the strength of the lorentzian model for @xmath75 is comparable with silica , the loss is estimated to be less than 5db / km at the wavelength of 750 nm and 1064 nm  @xcite . in fact , @xmath75 waveguide with propagation losses less than 0.1db / cm at the wavelength of 632",
    "nm had been reported in 1977  @xcite and gondarenko et .",
    "al demonstrated 0.055db / cm at the telecommunication wavelength  @xcite .",
    "a major source of the propagation loss is waveguide imperfections such as surface roughness and an refraction index difference of core and cladding layers .",
    "an evanescent field usually operates as strongly - guided modes , where their refraction index difference and propagation loss are higher than those of weakly - guided modes .",
    "we show the surface scattering loss from the waveguide  @xcite in order to estimate the absorbed optical power per unit volume at the mpl on the smrs as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_abs_bragg ] . based on ref .",
    "@xcite , the scattering losses normalized to the roughness variance of @xmath75 / @xmath94 waveguides ( te - like mode ) is 0.01(db / cm)/@xmath128 for 800 nm width ( core ) and 300 nm height ( core ) , where @xmath231 = 2.00 and @xmath232 = 1.45 for 1550 nm . after considering the wavelength - dependent scattering losses ( @xmath233 ( db / cm ) with @xmath234 for the te - like mode  @xcite ) , the scattering losses for 1064 nm light is 0.05(db / cm)/@xmath128 .",
    "therefore , the roughness variance of the waveguide determines the scattering losses .",
    "if the top - surface of the waveguide has 1@xmath128 roughness variance , the scattering losses from the top - surface is 0.05(db / cm ) .",
    "dominant scattering results from the side - wall roughness because of the imperfection of photolithographic waveguide patterns on photoresist before the etching process . in fig .",
    "[ fig_concept ] , direct illumination from the top surface of deposited @xmath75 affects smrs underneath the waveguide structure . from planar - waveguide loss theory  @xcite ( 2d analysis ) , illuminated power can be estimated based on the surface roughness and the correlation length of the roughness .",
    "the scattering losses of the planar waveguide can be modeled more reliably in 3d model , and the loss analysis in 3d is an order of magnitude smaller than the loss analysis in 2d  @xcite .      for a total optical trapping power of @xmath235 ,",
    "the absorbed optical power in the @xmath75 can be @xmath236 with the length of a waveguide @xmath152 and the extinction coefficient @xmath237 despite a low intrinsic absorption loss @xmath238 from ref .",
    "the extinction coefficient @xmath147 partially resulting in joule heating , excluding rayleigh scattering portion , is assumed to be less than @xmath239 at the wavelengths of our interest , based on the total optical losses .",
    "we simulate the thermal gradient with this input heat flux in comsol@xmath155 2d simulation with boundary condition ( the waveguide sample anchored at 3.5k cooling stage ) .",
    "this local heat source creates the bbr which should be prevented to protect smrs from thermally - excited quasiparticles .",
