    "the study of strongly - correlated electrons has become in the last decade one of the most active fields of condensed matter physics .",
    "the electronic properties of an increasing body of materials can not be described adequately by landau s theory of weakly - interacting quasiparticles ( fermi liquid theory).@xcite best known are the high-@xmath3 superconductors and organic conductors . in both cases ,",
    "a strong anisotropy and a narrow conduction band contribute to make the effects of interactions between electrons ( mainly coulomb repulsion ) dramatic .    from a theoretical point of view , quasi - one dimensional ( e.g. organic conductors ) and quasi - two dimensional ( e.g. high-@xmath3 superconductors ) systems are quite different . in one dimension , it is possible to solve satisfactorily a great number of models  : lattice hamiltonians such as the hubbard model@xcite can be solved exactly by bethe ansatz,@xcite whereas nonperturbative results can be obtained for the tomonaga - luttinger@xcite and the @xmath4-ology models from bosonization@xcite and renormalization - group techniques.@xcite conformal field theory has been applied as well , in particular to the hubbard model,@xcite whose bethe ansatz solution has limited practical utility .",
    "a unified phenomenology of the so - called _ luttinger liquids _ emerges from these works , whose most striking feature is probably spin - charge separation.@xcite    on the other hand , the above methods and results can not be generalized to the case of two dimensions , relevant to the cuo@xmath5 planes present in all high-@xmath3 superconductors . with a half - filled conduction band ,",
    "all the parent compounds of the cuprates are antiferromagnetic insulators , and the main challenge is to understand , first towards which kind of metal they evolve upon doping , and secondly whether superconductivity can occur , without a phonon - mediated coupling , in the vicinity of this antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "moreover , the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity@xcite is a strong experimental indication that the normal phase of high-@xmath3 superconductors is not a fermi liquid .    in this context , the hubbard model@xcite @xmath6 has spurred renewed interest for its ability to account for antiferromagnetic correlations and the mott metal - insulator transition .",
    "it is also the simplest model of interacting electrons . in eq .",
    "( [ hubmod ] ) , @xmath7 represents the hopping amplitude between two neighboring sites in a tight - binding approximation , and @xmath8 the strength of the very effectively screened ( and thus taken to be local ) coulomb repulsion . at half - filling and for @xmath9 ,",
    "the hubbard model is equivalent to a heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath10 , and its ground state has long - range nel order in any dimension @xmath11 .",
    "a mott transition can occur towards a metallic state either upon doping , or by increasing the ratio @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the hubbard model is the prototype of strongly - correlated electrons systems and has been intensely studied , although a more realistic model of the cuo@xmath5 planes of the cuprates should involve several bands.@xcite    solving the hubbard model is a difficult problem by itself , even in dimension @xmath13 , where the complexity of the bethe ansatz solution prevents one from actually computing most physical quantities .",
    "for example , its spectral weight is known only in the limit @xmath14 and at zero temperature.@xcite in any dimension @xmath11 , only approximate@xcite or numerical@xcite methods are available . only in the limit",
    "@xmath15 do important simplifications occur,@xcite allowing to compute most physically interesting quantities in an essentially exact way.@xcite in particular , the mott transition has been studied in great detail , and is still under discussion.@xcite strong coupling perturbation theory , which considers the interaction term of the hamiltonian as dominant , and the kinetic term as a perturbation , has been somewhat neglected so far .",
    "perturbative series for the thermodynamical potential have been obtained up to order @xmath16,@xcite but do not yield dynamical correlation functions .",
    "an original method effectively achieving infinite summations of terms , the so - called grassmannian hubbard - stratonovich transformation , was introduced independently by c.  bourbonnais@xcite and s.  sarker,@xcite but contained great difficulties which were overcome only recently@xcite by the authors .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop the ideas of ref .   in greater detail , and to present new results that have been obtained in the meantime .",
    "although we are naturally interested in the two - particle correlation functions ( magnetic susceptibility , conductivity , compressibility ) and the phase transitions of the hubbard model , it has proven simpler to first elucidate one - particle properties .",
    "furthermore , spin - charge separation in @xmath13 is mostly visible in the spectral weight,@xcite and it is possible to gain significant insight into the metal - insulator transition@xcite and antiferromagnetic correlations from the spectral weight alone .",
    "thus , we will focus on the one - particle properties of the hubbard model throughout most of this paper . from an experimental point of view , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is the probe of choice to measure the spectral weight .",
    "experiments have recently been conducted on quasi one - dimensional @xmath17@xcite and @xmath18@xcite , and on quasi two - dimensional @xmath19@xcite antiferromagnetic compounds , and further analyzed with the help of exact diagonalizations.@xcite    in sect",

    "for instance : @xmath36      at this point , one could use standard perturbation theory and expand the @xmath37-matrix in terms of unperturbed correlation functions . due to the absence of wick theorem in the case of a nonquadratic unperturbed hamiltonian",
    ", this approach does not lend itself to a satisfactory diagrammatic theory .",
    "one can not define one - particle irreducibility for the diagrams , and one has to be very careful in order to avoid double counting of certain contributions .",

    "these problems were solved by metzner,@xcite who organized the perturbation series as a cumulant expansion , and formulated diagrammatic rules with unrestricted sums over momenta . in this subsection",
    "we show that metzner s results can be obtained in a straightforward fashion and even further simplified by means of a simple transformation on the partition function .",

    "@xmath64 where a summation over repeated indices is implicit on the right - hand side .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us summarize our line of thought up to now .",
    "we wish to compute physical quantities within a strongly correlated fermion model ( say , the hubbard model ) .",
    "given that the energy of the interaction is greater than the bandwidth , we want to build a strong - coupling expansion .",
    "ordinary perturbation theory turns out to be quite cumbersome , but the simple transformation ( [ transfo ] ) restores wick s theorem and a ( nearly standard ) diagrammatic approach for the auxiliary fermions . finally , the simple relations ( [ gp],[green],[g2p2 ] ) make the connection back to electron green functions .",
    "we apply the method presented in the previous section to the hubbard model at half filling in any dimension .",
    "when doing so , we first have to deal with an unexpected causality problem , whose solution can be viewed as part of the method itself .",
    "then we compute the spectral function and the density of states , and discuss their relevance to the mott metal - insulator transition and to antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the simplest dynamical quantity amenable to our method is the one - particle spectral function : @xmath65 it is the simplest energy and wavevector resolved correlation function . as such",
    ", it contains a lot of physical information , far more detailed than the density of states , which is only its momentum - integrated version .",
    "it is also the best tool to investigate the fermi liquid character of the system , i.e. , whether or not it is dominated by a narrow peak at the fermi level . finally , it is very badly known from a theoretical ( and numerical ) point of view , whereas experiments of angle - resolved photoemission have recently become more reliable and precise . to obtain the green function , we have to compute the self - energy @xmath61 of the auxiliary fermions . from now on we will use the nearest - neighbor hubbard model @xmath66 which means that @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . throughout this section",
    ", we work at half - filling by setting the chemical potential to @xmath69 .",
    "the simplest diagram contributing to @xmath61 , of order zero in @xmath7 , is just the atomic green function @xmath70 where @xmath71 stand for a complex frequency ( we keep the symbol @xmath72 for a real frequency ) .",
    "this leads to the following approximate green function : @xmath73 one recognizes in eq .",
    "( [ rpa ] ) the result of the hubbard - i approximation , * ? ? ? * whose properties are well known .",
    "the original atomic levels at @xmath74 are spread out by the hopping term into two symmetric bands called hubbard bands .",
    "the lower band has band edges at @xmath75 and never reaches the fermi level , however large @xmath7 may be .",
    "thus , this approximation fails to describe the mott metal - insulator transition .",
    "but in the method used here , the hubbard - i approximation simply stems from the zeroth order value of @xmath61 , and we know a systematic way of improving it .",
    "0.5 truecm 6truecm    0.5 truecm    the diagrams contributing to @xmath61 up to order @xmath76 are presented in fig .",
    ". actually , there are more diagrams at this order , but they vanish due to the precise form of @xmath77 . to compute these diagrams ,",
    "we need the explicit expression of @xmath78 .",
    "the calculation of this atomic correlation function is a bit cumbersome , though simple in principle .",
    "the main result as well as several useful remarks are presented in appendix  [ atomique ] . for the time being ,",
    "let us focus on the result : @xmath79 by injecting the above approximate value of @xmath61 into eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) for the green function , one obtains a rational function of @xmath71 , presenting a finite number of poles in the complex plane .",
    "such a result is already somewhat disappointing since it can not account for a continuous spectral weight .",
    "but more seriously , the green function presents pairs of complex conjugate poles away from the real axis , and as a consequence does not verify kramers - kr \" onig relations .",
    "furthermore , for a wavevector verifying @xmath80 , the green function is equal to @xmath61 itself , and has high - order poles at @xmath74 , leading to negative spectral weight .",
    "so by simply replacing @xmath61 by its approximate value to third order in @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) , one ends up with a noncausal green function , whose spectral function is neither positive , nor normalized",
    ".    any green function acceptable on physical grounds should be causal and have a positive spectral weight , _",
    "i.e. _ , be a sum ( finite or infinite ) of simple real poles with positive residues .",
    "we call such a function _ lehmann representable _ since these properties are obvious when considering the lehmann representation of the green function . the way out of the problem is to seek a lehmann representable function resembling the approximate expression of @xmath81 as much as possible . since we know",
    "@xmath82 up to third order only , any function that differs from it by terms of order @xmath16 is _ a priori _ as good an approximation .",
    "a systematic way of building such a function is provided by a theorem reported in ref .  :",
    "a _ rational function _ is lehmann representable _ if and only if _ it can be written as a jacobi continued fraction @xmath83 with @xmath84 in any finite system , the exact green function can be cast into the form of eq .",
    "( [ jacobi ] ) with a finite value of @xmath85 ( the number of _ floors _ of the continued fraction ) .",
    "if we consider the coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 as functions of @xmath7 and expand @xmath88 in powers of @xmath7 , we destroy its continued fraction structure , and may well obtain an unacceptable approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "if we expand the coefficients themselves to some finite order in @xmath7 and leave them where they belong in @xmath88 , we can still expect their truncated taylor series to verify conditions eq .",
    "( [ co ] ) , and consequently the approximate @xmath88 obtained this way to be lehmann representable . in addition , their exists a double recurrence relation giving the @xmath86 and @xmath87 starting from the moments of the function . since we know the exact taylor expansion of @xmath82 up to order @xmath76 , we know all its spectral moments to the same precision .",
    "so all we have to do is to work out the recurrence relations and compute the coefficients of the continued fraction up to the best precision available .",
    "once an @xmath86 is found to be zero to the best of our knowledge   that is , if it contributes to the full @xmath89 , given the preceding coefficients , at an order higher than the working precision ( @xmath76 in this section )   we have to truncate the continued fraction . in all the cases that we treated ,",
    "such an @xmath86 always occurred rather quickly ( the deepest continued fraction we had to deal with had eight floors ) .",
    "this means that the density of poles is always weak , and the poles remain essentially well separated : they can not account for the precise shape of a continuous spectral weight , but can sample it adequately ( the moments of the distribution are well represented ) .",
    "more important , the approximate green function thus obtained is causal .    in order to test both the diagrammatic theory and the continued fraction representation",
    ", we treated the exactly solvable case of the atomic limit itself , away from half - filling . indeed , setting the chemical potential to @xmath90 , one can either compute the exact green function , then expand the solution in powers of @xmath91 , or notice that the shift of chemical potential has the form of a zero - range hopping and obtain the @xmath91 expansion from diagrams .",
    "this procedure is presented in appendix  [ testproc ] , and leads to the following main conclusions : the diagrams actually give the correct answer , which however presents the same causality problems as already mentioned , and the continued fraction representation properly builds back the poles and the residues of the exact solution .",
    "we also tested our approach on the ( again exactly solvable ) two - site problem , where the same conclusions apply .",
    "the above considerations also shed new light on the usual weak - coupling perturbation theory . in that case too , one gets multiple poles when truncating the series for @xmath82 , and the way out of this difficulty is to use dyson s equation  valid because wick s theorem applies directly to the original fermions  and to compute the self - energy .",
    "if the self - energy is lehmann representable , that is , if it possesses an underlying continued fraction structure , then the green function will inherit this structure from it and will be lehmann representable too .",
    "we did not find any definite answer as to why the self - energy itself , as obtained from a few diagrams , turns out to be acceptable in general , but there are some plausible explanations .",
    "one is that the unperturbed case already presents a continuum of levels , instead of only two .",
    "so if a double pole appears in the expression of a diagram , it is likely that its isolated contribution will be negligible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "also , the vertices of weak - coupling theories are often local in time or , if retarded , depend only on two times , whereas here the vertices have a full dependence on all frequencies entering them , which is quite peculiar .",
    "finally , nothing proves that a finite - order weak - coupling self - energy is always lehmann representable , and counter - examples may well exist .",
    "applying the above procedure to the result  ( [ res3 ] ) yields the following continued fraction : @xmath92 which has exactly the same taylor expansion as the exact green function up to order @xmath76 , verifies the conditions ( [ co ] ) , and is normalized to unity .",
    "the next two subsections show that the spectral weight deduced from eq .",
    "( [ res3 ] ) describes the mott metal - insulator transition , and the appearance of strong antiferromagnetic correlations at low temperature in the hubbard model .      strictly speaking",
    ", there is no rigorous definition of the mott transition in terms of one - particle properties only .",
    "but one can use as a heuristic criterion ( even at nonzero temperature ) the appearance of spectral weight at the fermi level . with the normalization ( [ a(k , w ) ] ) of the spectral weight , the density of states has the following expression : @xmath93 we observe that in the density of states , as @xmath7 increases from zero , the two symmetric hubbard bands  reduced to two delta functions at @xmath74 in the atomic limit ",
    "widen , and eventually mix for @xmath7 beyond some critical value . at high temperature ( @xmath94 ) ,",
    "the gap is closed by excitations of momentum @xmath95 and @xmath96 , making it possible to compute the exact value of the critical hopping : @xmath97 this gives @xmath98 for @xmath13 , to be compared with @xmath99 found in the hubbard - iii approximation .",
    "note that @xmath100 scales properly with the dimension , and leads to @xmath101 ( with @xmath102 ) in the limit of infinite dimension .",
    "this critical value of interaction strength is too large@xcite for two reasons .",
    "first , when @xmath103 our criterion corresponds to subbands that meet with an exponentially small density of states , therefore not yet truly closing the gap . secondly , when @xmath103 , the order of a diagram has to be counted in a different way .",
    "any nonlocal contribution becomes negligible , as is visible for example on the contributions of the third - order term of eq .",
    "( [ res3 ] ) to the continued fraction eq .",
    "( [ jacob3 ] ) .",
    "actually , the exact solution in @xmath103 is given by the diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "[ diagsdinf ] , as was mentioned in ref .  .",
    "therefore , the approximation  ( [ res3 ] ) becomes quite crude in infinite dimension .",
    "note that our criterion for the mott transition differs from that used in @xmath103 , since we simply demand the closure of the gap at the fermi level , without requiring the appearance of a new coherent peak in @xmath104 at @xmath105 .",
    "such a peak does not appear in the present approach .",
    "when @xmath106 , we can not calculate @xmath100 analytically because we do not know which excitations close the gap , but fig .",
    "[ crossover ] sketches a numerical evaluation ( for @xmath13 ) in the ( @xmath107 ) plane of the line where the gap vanishes .",
    "the value of @xmath100 grows upon lowering @xmath108 , and there is no mott transition at zero temperature , in agreement with the exact result.@xcite    0.5 truecm 8truecm    0.5 truecm    one has to keep in mind two important things about the insulator to metal transition described in this subsection .",
    "first , if we call @xmath109 the difference between the momentum of the highest negative energy ( hole - like ) excitation and that of the lowest positive energy ( particle - like ) excitation , then @xmath109 takes the value @xmath110 at high temperature , and goes to zero when @xmath111 , but the gap always remains indirect . secondly , even when the gap has been closed , the spectral weight at the fermi energy still has several well separated peaks .",
    "@xmath104 is never dominated at small @xmath72 by a single narrow quasiparticle peak allowing to define a fermi wavevector and a fermi velocity .",
    "thus , when extrapolating it beyond the transition , our solution does not describe a fermi liquid .",
    "this is not surprising since we do not expect a perturbative method starting from the completely localized insulating state to be able to describe both phases satisfactorily .",
    "0.5 truecm 8truecm    0.5 truecm      here again , a rigorous discussion of the magnetic behavior of the system should be based on the magnetic susceptibility , which is a two - particle function .",
    "nonetheless , the spectral weight should contain a valuable qualitative signature of increased antiferromagnetic correlations , namely a change in its periodicity .",
    "indeed , if there were a true antiferromagnetic ordering of the spins , the doubling of the unit cell should lead to a periodicity of @xmath112 in reciprocal space , instead of @xmath113 , in all the correlation functions .",
    "we expect signs of this reduced periodicity to appear , even in the disordered phase , when antiferromagnetic correlations become strong .",
    "their effect actually show up at low @xmath108 , as illustrated by the plot of @xmath114 of fig .",

    "[ crossover ] . for simplicity ,",
    "we discuss the 1d case in this subsection ( @xmath115 becomes @xmath116 ) , but the conclusions apply to any dimension .",
    "we stress that we only observe the appearance of increased correlations but always remain in the disordered state : a true transition towards a long - range ordered state in @xmath117 is not visible in our results , and fig .",
    "[ crossover ] is by no means a phase diagram , but only a crossover diagram where we distinguished regions of different qualitative behavior of the one - particle spectral function .",

    "these changes reflect the af short - range order that gradually builds up when @xmath108 becomes smaller than the af superexchange @xmath125 of the equivalent @xmath126 model .",
    "as suggested above , the approximate cell doubling in direct space translates into a nearly @xmath112-periodic dispersion for peak 2 , although the @xmath113-periodicity of its weight and of @xmath127 reminds us that the state remains paramagnetic .",

    "we chose to define an af crossover line in fig .",

    "furthermore , in this regime , the width of band 2 is of order @xmath129 whatever the value of @xmath7 , supporting the above interpretation .",
    "the purpose of this section is to try and find out where in parameter space  the @xmath2 plane  the approximate green function ( [ jacob3 ] ) can be regarded as reliable , to improve it and compare it with monte - carlo results when possible .",
    "the entire section applies to the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "0.5 truecm 8truecm    0.5 truecm      it is not an easy task to define a domain of validity for the present approximation scheme for several reasons .",
    "first , the expansion parameter being the hopping amplitude @xmath7 , any hopping process is considered on an equal footing regardless of whether it involves a change in the double occupancy or not . as a consequence ,",
    "we expect the ratio @xmath130 to play as important a role as @xmath131 .",
    "secondly the end result involves @xmath7 in a complicated way , and not only through a power series .",
    "nevertheless , since the atomic green function is just @xmath132 and gives spectral weight only at @xmath133 , we expect an approximation of the form  ( [ jacobi ] ) to be valid when the @xmath87 s are small with respect to @xmath134 . when applied to eq .",
    "( [ jacob3 ] ) , this criterion leads to the conditions : @xmath135 the first requirement is quite intuitive : it expresses that the bandwidth is smaller that the on - site interaction , which was the basic assumption anyway .",
    "the second one gives the low - temperature limitation of the method . in dimension @xmath13 , the region where the two conditions eq .  ( [ limites ] ) are fulfilled lies under the dashed line of fig .",
    "[ crossover ] .",
    "when extrapolating the results outside this region , one can not predict how fast the approximation may deteriorate .",
    "in particular , it is worth mentioning that the @xmath136 ( free - particle ) limit is recovered properly . on the other hand , at small @xmath7",
    "the @xmath111 limit again gives a free - particle behavior ( except for a singular behavior for wavevectors such that @xmath80 ) , which is obviously wrong .",
    "this allows us to define , besides the region of ( almost ) certain validity under the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ crossover ] , a hatched region of acknowledged failure . for the one - dimensional case , the theoretical@xcite and exact@xcite results describing spin - charge separation fall in this region of parameter space , which prevents us from making any meaningful comparison .",
    "however , a definite prediction of our work is that upon raising the temperature , there appears noticeable spectral weight near @xmath137 ( for @xmath138 ) .",
    "this new feature of the spectral weight , visible as peak 3 of fig .",
    "[ spec1 ] and absent from the zero - temperature solutions , might correspond to the `` question - mark '' features in fig .  1 of ref .  .",
    "thus , temperature seems to have a drastic effect on the distribution of spectral weight .",
    "requirements such as eq .",
    "( [ limites ] ) are expected since we are dealing with a perturbative method .",
    "but beside these limitations , our solution ( eq .  ( [ jacob3 ] ) ) is plagued with a more serious problem , namely its discrete spectral weight .",
    "indeed , the exact solution in the thermodynamic limit certainly has a continuous distribution of poles on the real axis .",
    "such a continuous distribution is in general necessary to account for spin - charge separation , or a finite lifetime of one - particle excitations .",
    "therefore , an approximation describing the spectral weight as a sum of four delta functions is necessarily a crude one .",
    "the reason why it is difficult to obtain a continuous spectral weight is the huge degeneracy of the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the starting point being a collection of independent atoms with the same two energy levels , it is not likely that a finite - order perturbation scheme can produce a macroscopic number of distinct approximate eigenvalues .",
    "we will discuss in section  [ infresum ] a partially self - consistent approach leading to an extended spectral weight .",
    "but in the latter case , we no longer have the freedom to add higher - order terms in order to solve the causality problem .",
    "facing these difficulties , we computed the fourth and fifth order of the green function , in the hope that they would introduce many more poles into the two narrow hubbard bands and give some hints of the lineshape towards which the spectral weight tends .",
    "let us stress straight away that one is never certain to improve a perturbative result by adding higher - order terms . actually , in most of the cases where perturbation theory is used , the series is asymptotic rather than convergent , and there is an optimal order  typically of the order of the inverse of the expansion parameter  beyond which the approximation deteriorates quickly with each new term.@xcite computing the fourth and fifth order presented a substantial technical difficulty , since it involved the function @xmath139 having a different expression for each of the @xmath140 possible time orderings ( one of the times can be set to zero ) .",
    "we overcame this difficulty by designing a symbolic manipulation program dedicated to this problem , taking advantage of the very systematic form of the expressions in the atomic limit .",
    "let us mention that up to fifth order  and that seems to be general  the even orders lead to a modification of the partial numerators ( @xmath86 ) only , and the odd orders lead to a modification of the partial denominators ( @xmath87 ) only , within the continued fraction ( [ jacobi ] ) .",
    "appendix  [ hods ] presents the diagrams and the result for @xmath141 up to fourth order . @xmath141 and",
    "the corresponding continued fraction have been computed up to fifth order included , but are too lengthy to be presented .    at both orders the green function has eight poles , among which only six have a significant residue .",
    "thus , there appears only one more pole in each hubbard band with respect to order @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , except for the region where the series certainly converges , the fifth order may give an answer quite different from that of the third or fourth order .",
    "in particular , the presence of diverging coefficients makes the self - energy ( in the usual sense ) go to zero very fast upon lowering the temperature , and the solution then coincides with the free - particle limit , completely missing the antiferromagnetic correlation effect described in sect .",
    "[ afcorr ] . thus , despite the important effort invested in computing orders @xmath16 and @xmath142 , little progress has been achieved : the poles still appear as a sparse sampling of the spectral weight rather than a faithful fit , and the complexity of the solution has increased up to a point where it is hardly tractable .    in order to test the analytic validity of our results ,",
    "we computed the exact green function up to fifth order for the exactly solvable two - site problem , and compared with the diagrammatic approach .",
    "the two approaches are proven consistent with each other and the test is summarized in appendix  [ hods ] . in the precise case of two sites ,",
    "the continued fraction has only four poles instead of eight , as it should .",
    "it is interesting to see that in that case too , the best approximation can be the third , fourth , or fifth order , depending on the parameters .",
    "most importantly , the two - site problem confirms that dealing with a small value of @xmath131 is not sufficient to ensure the accuracy of the approximation . as a matter of fact",
    ", we observed empirically that higher orders improve the solution for @xmath143 , and deteriorate it for @xmath144 .",
    "explaining precisely why perturbation theory fails at low temperature appears difficult ; this is probably related to the huge degeneracy of the system in the atomic limit .",
    "0.5 truecm 16truecm    0.5 truecm      we now present monte - carlo data supporting and illustrating the conclusions claimed so far , regarding the physical behavior of the model , as well as the accuracy of our approximation at various orders in @xmath7 .",
    "the simulations@xcite were done for a twenty - site one - dimensional lattice for reasons of computing power and time .",
    "the spectral weight was deduced from imaginary time green functions by the maximum entropy method.@xcite the first interesting region is the crossover between the ordinary paramagnetic insulator and the strongly af correlated insulator . fig .",

    "third- , fourth- , and fifth - order results are displayed .",

[ crossover ] ) .",
    "however no such thing is expected in two dimensions , for which the antiferromagnetically correlated region extends without spin - charge separation down to @xmath153 where true long - range order takes place .",
    "the upper border of the paramagnetic insulator region , defined by the closure of the gap , can be computed more precisely than in fig .",

    "thus , in fig .",

    "the position of the line separating the paramagnetic metal ( gapless ) from an antiferromagnetically correlated insulator ( gapped ) becomes conjectural , since fifth order fails to describe it , and third order no longer brings it to the right `` triple '' point when lowering @xmath7 .",
    "anyway , the density plot for point f @xmath159 ( fig .",

    "the agreement is excellent , even though the parameters fall in a region where we do not expect our approximation to be good .",
    "such a good agreement with monte - carlo data outside of the expected region of validity has also been observed in one dimension.@xcite this probably means that the criteria ( [ limites ] ) are to stringent .",
    "one may instead apply the following _ a posteriori _ criterion : the approximate spectral distribution is reliable if a large fraction of the weight ( say , 90% ) falls within @xmath160 of the original hubbard bands at @xmath161 ( this is the case for fig .",
    "[ spech2 ] , as well as for fig .  3 of ref .  )",
    ". this softer criterion of reliability probes the overall effect of hopping on the spectral weight , without a detailed analysis of partial numerators and denominators , whose effect on the spectral weight is often far from obvious .    to summarize , the strong - coupling expansion has two serious limitations : ( i ) one can not expect to describe faithfully the lineshape of the spectral function and ( ii ) it is impossible to obtain an accurate result for any temperature much lower than @xmath7 .",
    "we add that going beyond fifth order within the systematic approach described in this paper would be difficult and unpractical , since the ( intractable ) result would be relevant only deep in the insulating region . on the other hand , monte - carlo calculations agree well with our results as far as the overall distribution of the weight is concerned , and confirm the qualitative conclusions of section  [ application ] , summarized in fig .",

    "[ jacobi ] are no longer all positive .",
    "this is yet another manifestation of the limitation of our method at low temperature where , according to refs .",
    ", there should be a quick and massive redistribution of spectral weight between the hubbard bands when varying @xmath210 .",
    "the breakdown of our solution , which occurs around @xmath217 , is concomitant with a lack of monotonicity in the relation between chemical potential and filling .",

    "[ mitcroissant ] shows , for several temperatures , the line in the ( @xmath7,@xmath226)-plane where the fermi level enters the upper hubbard band .",
    "the numbers associated with each curve are estimations of the accuracy at the points @xmath147 , beyond which the solution breaks down .",
    "these numbers are the relative difference between the results for @xmath227 obtained in two independent ways  : from the green function ( through the density of states ) and from the thermodynamical potential .",
    "note from fig .",
    "[ mitcroissant ] that , in the atomic limit @xmath228 , the transition occurs near @xmath229 . indeed , in the atomic limit , it is a simple matter to show that the chemical potential vanishes at @xmath153 at this filling , and finite temperature corrections are exponentially small as long as @xmath230 .",
    "the chemical potential then touches one of the ( infinitely narrow ) atomic bands ( at @xmath105 and @xmath231 ) and any infinitesimal value of @xmath7 makes the system conduct",
    ".    0.5 truecm 8truecm    0.5 truecm    thus , in the high - temperature regime where our method is reliable , the mott - hubbard insulator shares som of the features of a band insulator  : the gap is nearly rigid , and a crossover towards a good conductivity is obtained when the population of carriers ceases to be exponentially small .",
    "in contrast to a band insulator , there is , however , some transfer of spectral weight towards the band closest to the fermi level , when @xmath210 is changed from its half - filled value .    for @xmath232 ,",
    "the expected drastic changes in the spectral weight are not properly described by our approximate solution , which instead becomes unphysical .",
    "in this work , we have developed the ideas of our earlier paper,@xcite and pushed the computations to higher order .",
    "the initial causality problem , a conspicuous difference between strong- and weak - coupling perturbation theories , was solved by the continued fraction representation . among our main results",
    "are the crossover diagrams of fig .",
    "[ crossam ] .",
    "they demonstrate the possibility of describing the three qualitatively different regions of parameter space of the half - filled hubbard model by a single approximate analytic expression for the green function . with respect to ref .  , these crossover diagrams were refined by higher - order terms .",
    "moreover , the crossover diagrams are based on spectral weights that we have shown to be consistent with monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the difference between these spectral weights and their zero - temperature counterparts obtained from other methods , demonstrates an important temperature dependence of @xmath104 .",
    "we have pointed out the limitations of the simple strong - coupling perturbation series .",
    "firstly , our solution breaks down quickly upon lowering the temperature just after the magnetic correlations have started to show up .",
    "this explains why the spatial dimension @xmath233 plays a minor role in our solution . actually , as long as magnetic correlations play no role , i.e. , at high - enough temperature , all dimensions are known to show similar behaviors as far as the metal - insulator crossover is concerned ( we include dimension @xmath13 , for which the gap predicted by bethe ansatz is exponentially small in a finite range of @xmath234 ) . but",
    "our method fails at lower temperature , where the system evolves towards spin - charge separation ( @xmath13 ) , or a true antiferromagnetic transition at zero ( @xmath206 ) or finite ( @xmath117 ) temperature .",
    "secondly , the systematic strong - coupling expansion can only provide a finite number of poles in the continued fraction and the correponding approximate green function can not have continuous spectral weight .",
    "this does not prevent meaningful comparisons with monte - carlo data , since the overall spectral weight distribution can be assessed .",
    "this `` discreteness problem '' might be solved with the help of a suitable termination function within the continued fraction,@xcite but this is impossible without any prior knowledge about the green function .",
    "the simplest ways of obtaining a continuous spectral weight from infinite subsets of diagrams lead to nonpositive or unnormalized functions .",
    "another important difficulty of any expansion about the atomic limit is the absence of wick theorem for the atomic limit itself .",
    "the auxiliary fermions allowed us to organize the expansion in the best possible way , and to reduce tremendously the number of diagrams at a given order .",
    "nevertheless , the exact @xmath235 s are still necessary , and the result of appendix  [ atomique ] for @xmath193 suggests that they are quite difficult to compute for @xmath236 . introducing a physically motivated approximation scheme for the atomic vertices would allow further progress , particularly on the two - particle correlation functions .",
    "the full two - particle correlation function in the atomic limit ( @xmath14 ) is a noteworthy byproduct of our work .",
    "the major challenge faced by the strong - coupling perturbation theory is the low - temperature barrier .",
    "we pointed out that the exponentially large degeneracy of the atomic ground state is likely to be the source of the problem .",
    "one possible solution to this difficulty is to select a ground state more likely to connect with the low - temperature phases and to organize the perturbation series around that ground state , which would imply a certain amount of self - consistency .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
    "while this paper focused on properties derived from the one - particle green function , two - particle green functions are also accessible within the method presented here , but their systematic computation is more involved at order @xmath16 ( it requires the atomic four - particle function @xmath237 ) .",
    "for this reason , we defer discussion of two - particle correlations to a future publication .",
    "we thank c.  bourbonnais and n.  dupuis for many useful discussions .",
    "we are grateful to h. touchette , s.  moukouri , l. chen , and especially d.  poulin and s.  allen for sharing their numerical results .",

    "the first step consists in expanding the exponential of the interaction terms of eq .",
    "( [ z3 ] ) : @xmath239 \\e^{-s_0[\\ps ^{\\star},\\ps ] } \\sum_{p=0}^\\infty { ( -)^p\\over p ! } \\l ( \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty}s_{\\rm int}^r[\\ps ^{\\star},\\ps ] \\r ) ^p\\>.\\ ] ] for a given @xmath240 , and taking into account the factor @xmath241 , we have a sum of terms of the following form : @xmath242 ... s_{\\rm int}^{r_p}[\\ps ^{\\star},\\ps ] \\>,\\ ] ] where @xmath243 are @xmath240 integers , and @xmath244 the multiplicities of the different values that occur in the sequence @xmath243 .",

    "again , let us stress that the indices in the sum do not run over all their possible values , but rather are restricted to have a common site index if they refer to the same vertex ( this restriction is encoded in the primed sum ) .",
    "since the action is gaussian , wick s theorem is valid , and one can compute the average in expression ( [ term2 ] ) as a sum over all possible permutations @xmath249 of @xmath250 elements : @xmath251 where @xmath252 stands for the signature of the permutation , and @xmath253 .",
    "a term in the sum over the permutations can be represented easily by a feynman diagram , according to the following rules :    1 .",
    "draw @xmath240 polygons ( vertices ) having @xmath254 apices ( internal points ) respectively , and @xmath255 isolated points ( external points ) .",
    "2 .   to half of the external points and half of the apices of each vertex , attach an outgoing arrow ( a `` bra '' , corresponding to a  @xmath49 ) . to the rest of the points and apices ,",
    "attach an incoming arrow ( a `` ket '' , corresponding to  a  @xmath256 ) .",
    "3 .   label the bras in a conventional order ( first the external ones , then all the bras of each vertex consecutively ) , and label the kets with corresponding primed integers .",
    "4 .   to each point",
    "assign a latin index , the indices of the internal points sharing the same value of the spatial component for each vertex .",
    "finish drawing the arrows according to the permutation @xmath249 . to the lines",
    "assign a propagator @xmath257 ( bra index first ) , and to the vertices assign a @xmath258 ( ket indices first ) .",
    "integrate over all the internal variables .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "first , the ratio @xmath259 allows a restriction to connected diagrams only.@xcite secondly , it can easily be seen that the exchange of two equivalent vertices does not change the value of a diagram , nor does the exchange of two internal points of the same type ( bra or ket ) on the same vertex .",
    "this allows a restriction to topologically different diagrams , each of which with a proper multiplicity factor .",
    "thus , to span all the permutations , it is sufficient to consider only the topologically distinct diagrams , and to assign them a factor @xmath260 due to the presence of various types of vertices ( @xmath85-body interaction , @xmath261 ) , the counting of the sign and symmetry factor can not be simplified as in the usual two - body interaction case .",
    "a third remark is that in general @xmath21 and @xmath28 conserve spin , and so spin is conserved along the lines , and the total spin entering a vertex is the same as the total spin leaving it .    0.5 truecm 8truecm    0.5 truecm    0.5 truecm 3.5truecm    0.5 truecm    after a fourier transform , space and time translation invariance of the on - site hamiltonian @xmath262 result in the conservation of total momentum and total matsubara frequency at each vertex .",
    "the rules remain the same , except that one can _ a priori _ impose the above conservation laws along the lines and at each vertex .",
    "there remain @xmath263 independent internal variables entering sums of the following type : @xmath264 where @xmath265 is the size of the lattice , @xmath115 a vector of the reciprocal lattice , and @xmath266 a fermionic matsubara frequency . finally , if the on - site hamiltonian @xmath262 is sufficiently simple as to allow for an exact computation of the vertices ( the @xmath267 s ) , we can obtain , by usual diagrammatic perturbation theory , any correlation function of the auxiliary field .",
