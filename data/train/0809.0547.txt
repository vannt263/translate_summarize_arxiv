    "homogeneous statistical samples of high - redshift quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) allow not only investigation of the qso phenomenon itself , but also provide important information for a wide variety of studies .",
    "in particular , the luminosity function of high - redshift qsos provides strong constraints on the theory of the accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies . the increasing evidence for a relation between the formation of galaxy bulges and supermassive black holes ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) emphasises the importance of understanding the role of qso activity in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the luminosity function of qsos is also essential to quantify their contribution to the x - ray background and the uv ionising flux at high redshift .",
    "in addition , the absorption spectra of these qsos reveal the state of the intergalactic medium at early epochs .",
    "although radio - loud ( rl ) qsos are a small subset of the qso population , samples of high - redshift rl qsos benefit from higher completeness , due to the drastically reduced contamination by stars in samples of radio selected qso candidates , compared to optically ( colour ) selected qso candidates ( richards et al .",
    "2006 ) . moreover , the connection between radio and optical activity , which still needs to be understood , requires a comparison between radio - loud and radio - quiet qso populations .",
    "ivezik et al .",
    "( 2004 ) provide conclusive evidence that the distribution of radio - to - optical flux ratio for qsos , i.e. the radio loudness , is bimodal ( the so - called qso radio dichotomy ) , on the basis of accurate optical and radio measurements of a large sample of rl qsos obtained from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty cm survey ( first ; becker , white & helfand 1995 ) .",
    "many studies suggest that rl qsos reside in more massive galaxies and harbour more massive central black holes than radio - quiet qsos , but the point is still controversial ( see references for and against these arguments at cirasuolo et al .",
    "a recent study by jiang et al . ( 2007 ) based on a qso sample drawn from sdss and first shows that the fraction of rl qsos decreases with increasing redshift and with decreasing optical luminosity .",
    "we aim to obtain a homogeneous sample of high - redshift rl qsos ( @xmath3 above @xmath6 ) drawn from correlation of the first catalogue ( @xmath7 mjy ) with unresolved objects in the sdss data release 5 ( sdss dr5 , adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "the area of overlap between first and the dr5 imaging survey is @xmath8 7391 deg@xmath9 and the number of selected first - sdss matches is 8665 ( section 2 ) .",
    "sdss provides : ( i ) @xmath10 photometry , which is a powerful tool for separating high-@xmath3 qsos from other populations ( e.g. stars , qsos with @xmath3 below @xmath6 or unresolved low-@xmath3 galaxies ) ; ( ii ) morphological classification , essential for distinguishing between high-@xmath3 qsos and galaxies or resolved low-@xmath3 active galactic nuclei ; and ( iii ) spectroscopy of many of our candidates ( 4250 ) , selected as spectroscopic targets by sdss dr5 . since sdss",
    "spectroscopic observations necessarily lag the imaging , the total dr5 spectroscopic area is lower , with @xmath11 deg@xmath9 included in the overlap with first .",
    "most of the candidates with available spectroscopy were classified by sdss as qsos , i.e. have a secure detection of a high - excitation emission line with fwhm @xmath12 1000 km sec@xmath13 .",
    "the rest are galaxies , stars and objects of ` unknown ' class .",
    "52 dr5 sources were spectroscopically classified as @xmath0 qsos ( table 1 ) .",
    "our approach to obtaining a high-@xmath3 qso sample was to extend the existing sample of 52 first - dr5 high-@xmath3 qsos by applying automated learning techniques , specifically neural networks ( nns ) , to the 8665 first - sdss dr5 photometric matches .",
    "nns have been shown to be powerful tools for both classification and regression tasks , in many fields of astronomy , and have subsequently been applied to predict object classes and/or astrophysical parameters .",
    "fields where nns have been applied include : classification of stellar spectra ( bailer - jones , irwin & von hippel 1998 ) ; morphological star / galaxy separation ( e. g. bertin & arnouts 1996 ) ; morphological classification , spectral typing and/or photometric redshifts of galaxies [ folkes , lahav & maddox 1996 ; lahav et al .",

    "qso selection and estimation of qso photometric redshifts are of prime importance for the sdss project .",
    "various studies address the problem using different machine learning approaches .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 2004 ) applied a probability density analysis based on kernel density estimation of the colour distribution of stars and spectroscopically confirmed qsos in sdss dr1 , to classify , as stars or qsos , a catalogue of over @xmath14 unresolved , @xmath15 mag , uv - excess ( @xmath16 ) qso candidates .",
    "the resulting efficiency and completeness ( the latter evaluated for @xmath17 ) for the selection of qsos in the candidate sample was estimated to be around 95 per cent up to @xmath18 , the redshift limit mainly arising from the restriction of the catalogue to uv - excess objects .",
    "suchkov , hanish and margon ( 2005 ) applied the oblique decision tree classifier classx to classify sdss - dr2 photometric objects into 25 classes [ stars , red stars , 10 redshift bins for galaxies , and 13 for active galactic nuclei ( hereafter agn ) ] using colour information and morphology ( attributes ` resolved ' or ` unresolved ' ) from sdss .",
    "for each of the 12 redshift bins for agn with @xmath19 and covering @xmath20 , the completeness obtained for the test sample is in the range from 43 to 81 per cent , with an average 63 per cent .",
    "for the high - redshift bin , in the range @xmath21 , the completeness drops to 14 per cent , the remaining high-@xmath3 agns beeing classifified as stars ( 47 per cent ) or as agn in the adyacent redshift bin @xmath22 ( 39 per cent ) .",
    "this result illustrates the difficulty in separating high-@xmath3 qsos from other classes .",
    "the efficiency or fraction of true high-@xmath3 qsos among the sources classified in the agn high-@xmath3 bin was @xmath8 75 per cent .",
    "ball et al .",
    "( 2006 ) applied decision trees , trained on the sdss - dr3 objects with available spectroscopy , to classify all photometric objects ( @xmath23 ) in sdss - dr3 in one of the three categories of star , galaxy or nsng ( neither star nor galaxy ) , the latter including qsos and ` unknown ' . a blind test on the 2df qso redshift survey",

    "the authors do not discuss how the performance depends on redshift .",
    "bazell , miller and subbarao ( 2006 ) use a semisupervised mixture model approach to analyze 10000 objects spectrosopically classified in sdss - dr4 in the categories of stars , late - type stars , galaxies and qsos with @xmath24 and unknown , using as input data for the modelling sdss colours and the spectroscopic class . since the aim was to investigate the existence of possible new object types among the class of ` unknown ' as well as subclasses among the remaining classes , 90 per cent of the sources in the categories of stars , late - type stars , galaxies and qsos were also treated as unknown during the modelling .",
    "the best model includes 16 components , two of them of the nonpredefined type , and one of the latter captures a region of the @xmath25 versus @xmath26 colour - colour diagram ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) within the location of high-@xmath3 qsos in richards et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , but intentionally rejected in the qso selection by richards et al .",
    "( 2004 ) because of the high density of stellar contaminants in that region .",
    "gao , zhang and zhao ( 2008 ) compare the performance of @xmath29-dimensional trees and support vector machines in the separation between stars and qsos , using a sample of stars and qsos spectroscopically classified in sdss - dr5 and having a counterpart at the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass , cutri et al .",
    "both techniques yield a global efficiency and completeness as large as 97 per cent for @xmath30 .",
    "however , again the accuracy drops significantly for @xmath31 .",
    "our work deals with the selection of high-@xmath3 qsos from sdss - first matches .",
    "as stated before , our restriction to radio detected sources drastically reduces the contamination by stars , enabling us to obtain classification accuracies at these redshifts better than those obtained in more general studies aimed at the selection of the whole population of qsos , regardless of radio detection .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the sample of first - dr5 matches is presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we explore the performance of supervised nns to separate high-@xmath3 qsos from the remaining spectral classes in the sample of 4250 sources with dr5 spectra , using multiband optical photometry and radio data . in sections 4.1 and 4.2 , we apply the trained nns to the sample of 4415 sources without dr5 spectra , identifying 58 high-@xmath3 qso candidates . in section 4.3",
    "we check the reliability of this identification via comparison with spectra from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , sdss dr6 and follow - up spectroscopy with the wht .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "as an initial sample we selected _ all _ first sources with an unresolved object in the photoprimary view of the sdss dr5 catalog archive server ( cas ) , within 1.5 arcsec of the radio position , with dereddened psf magnitude @xmath32 and ` clean ' photometry ( i.e. rejecting objects with magnitude errors @xmath33 0.2 in all five bands @xmath10 , or flagged as ` bright ' , ` saturated ' , ` edge ' , ` blended ' or ` child ' ) .",
    "we selected the @xmath34 band because qsos with redshifts @xmath35 are expected to have an enhanced emission at this band , due to the ly@xmath36 emission line falling within the covered spectral range .",
    "vigotti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimated that more than 99 per cent of first - apm quasars with @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath7 mjy fall within 1.5 arcsec of the poss i positions , and this matching radius was adopted for this work . in total 8665 first sources",
    "fulfil the above requirements .",
    "because of the exclusion of ` child ' objects ( objects which are the product of deblending a blended object ) , in all cases there is _ one _ optical object per radio source . the corrections for galactic extinction , derived from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , were taken from sdss .",
    "4250 of the sources ( 49 per cent of the sample ) have dr5 spectra ( specifically , they are included in the specobj view of the dr5 cas ) .",
    "in fact , the magnitude limit @xmath39 was set to ensure an approximately similar fraction of sources with and without spectra at dr5 .",
    "the distribution of sdss spectral types and redshifts for the objects with dr5 spectra , as quoted in specobj , are given in table 1 .",
    "the redshift distribution of the qsos is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the redshifts of the qsos with @xmath0 were checked by visual inspection of the dr5 spectra . for two of them , sdss 130941.36 + 112540.1 and sdss 153420.23 + 413007.5 , we found the redshifts provided by the sdss pipelines to be likely incorrect , and subsequently the qsos were identified in the sdss dr5 quasar catalog ( dr5q ; schneider et al .",

    "these two qsos were not considered further and are not included in table 1 and fig . 1 .",

    "our aim is to obtain a high completeness for high-@xmath3 qsos , non high-@xmath3 sources whose spectra can be confused with those of high-@xmath3 qsos should be preferably removed from the training sample , since their inclusion could hinder the selection of the high-@xmath3 qsos whose spectra they resemble .",

    "however , the ned database provides spectroscopic identifications assigned from other surveys , and the absence of ned high-@xmath3 qsos among the non - candidates gives therefore independent evidence that the classifier has a good completeness in its extension to dr5 unlabelled sources .",
    "three dr5 unlabelled sources are identified as @xmath0 qsos in ned , all of them selected as high-@xmath3 qso candidates in our work .",
    "in this paper we aimed to obtain a sample of @xmath0 qsos , starting from an initial complete sample of 8665 first sources with star - like counterparts in the sdss dr5 photometric survey , of which 4250 have spectra in dr5 , 52 of them being @xmath0 qsos .",

    "spectra of 13 additional candidates from the ned and from dr6 revealed seven more high-@xmath3 qsos , yielding a total 40 candidates with spectra available , of which 24 are high-@xmath3 qsos .",
    "the number of high-@xmath3 qsos was then increased from 52 in the initial sample to 76 ( a factor 1.46 ) .",
    "the overall efficiency in the selection of new high-@xmath3 qsos is @xmath79 per cent ( 24/40 ) .",

    "<S> we aim to obtain a complete sample of redshift @xmath0 radio qsos from first sources ( @xmath1 mjy ) having star - like counterparts in the sdss dr5 photometric survey ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our starting sample of 8665 first - dr5 pairs includes 4250 objects with spectra in dr5 , 52 of these being @xmath0 qsos . </S>",
    "<S> we found that simple supervised neural networks , trained on the sources with dr5 spectra , and using optical photometry and radio data , are very effective for identifying high-@xmath3 qsos in a sample _ without _ spectra . </S>",
    "<S> for the sources with dr5 spectra the technique yields a completeness ( fraction of actual high-@xmath3 qsos classified as such by the neural network ) of 96 per cent , and an efficiency ( fraction of objects selected by the neural network as high-@xmath3 qsos that actually are high-@xmath3 qsos ) of 62 per cent . applying the trained networks to the 4415 sources _ without _ dr5 spectra we found 58 @xmath0 qso candidates . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained spectra of 27 of them , and 17 are confirmed as high-@xmath3 qsos . </S>",
    "<S> spectra of 13 additional candidates from the literature and from sdss dr6 revealed seven more @xmath0 qsos , giving an overall efficiency of 60 per cent ( 24/40 ) . </S>",
    "<S> none of the non - candidates with spectra from ned or dr6 is a @xmath0 qso , consistently with a high completeness . </S>",
    "<S> the initial sample of high-@xmath3 qsos is increased from 52 to 76 sources , i.e. by a factor 1.46 . from the new identifications and candidates we estimate an incompleteness of sdss for the spectroscopic classification of first @xmath4 qsos of 15 per cent for @xmath5 .    </S>",
