    "the classification of rotational bands as quasiparticle configurations in a rotating mean - field has led to an understanding of the yrast- spectra of rapidly rotating nuclei @xcite .",
    "this popular approach referred to as the cranked shell model ( csm ) has been employed quite extensively and is reviewed in refs .",
    "these high - spin studies have provided new insights into the nature of the pair - correlations among identical particles @xcite .",
    "the csm in its traditional form assumes that there are no proton - neutron ( pn- ) pair correlations .",
    "modern @xmath6-ray detector arrays will allow to study high - spin states for nuclei near the @xmath3 line in the mass @xmath7 50 and 80 regions @xcite and these possibilities will be greatly enhanced with the availability of the radioactive beams . for these nuclei",
    "strong pn - pair correlations are expected . by studying the rotational bands one may obtain new information about the pn - pairing in deformed nuclei . for this purpose , it is necessary to reformulate the csm in such a way that the pn - pairing is included .    the main motivation of the present work is to develop a quasiparticle csm approach near @xmath3 which includes the pn - pairing effects . as will be shown , the isospin symmetry plays a central role , permitting to derive the basic structure of the rotational spectra in terms of quasiparticle configurations in a @xmath8 pair - field .",
    "general rules for constructing the quasiparticle excitation spectra in the presence of np - pairing will be provided .",
    "we shall study a model problem of protons and neutrons in a deformed @xmath9 shell interacting with a @xmath10-force , which is solved by exact numerical diagonalization .",
    "the suggested csm approach will be tested using these exact results .",
    "we have used the @xmath9 shell for the simplicity in carrying out the exact deformed shell model ( sm ) calculations , expecting the csm predictions to improve in larger shells as the mean - field becomes more dominant with increasing number of particles .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the suggested csm with good isospin can be cast into a form that permits calculations by means of a conventional csm approach .",
    "taking advantage of this , the yrast - spectra of even - even , odd - odd @xmath3 and odd-@xmath11 @xmath12 nuclei near @xmath13 are constructed and compared with the experimental data .",
    "the meager experimental information available is consistent with the suggested dominance of a @xmath8 monopole pn - pair field .",
    "as a case study for the csm to be developed , we use the deformed shell model hamiltonian which consists of a cranked deformed one - body term , @xmath14 and a scalar two - body delta - interaction @xcite .",
    "the one - body term is the familiar cranked nilsson mean - field potential which takes into account of the long range part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the residual short range interaction is specified by the delta - interaction . in many of the high spin studies ,",
    "the residual interaction is in the form of a monopole interaction .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated @xcite that the higher multipoles can be important .",
    "hence , in our model study we consider all possible multipole components of the delta - interaction and also all the possible interaction terms , proton - proton ( pp ) , neutron - neutron ( nn ) and neutron - proton ( np ) . the sm hamiltonian employed is given by @xmath15 where , @xmath16 we use @xmath17 as our energy unit and the deformation energy @xmath18 is related to the deformation parameter @xmath19 . for the case of @xmath9 shell",
    ", @xmath18=1.75 approximately corresponds to @xmath20 . in order to solve the eigenvalue problem exactly ,",
    "we are limited to a small configuration space . as in the previous work ,",
    "the model space in the present analysis consists of a single j shell .",
    "we have diagonalized the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) exactly for neutrons and protons in the @xmath9 shell . as the strengths of nn- , pp- and np - parts are identical",
    ", the hamiltonian is invariant with respect to rotations in isospace , i. e. @xmath21 where @xmath22 defines a rotation in isospace , generated by the isospin operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is invariant with respect to a spatial rotation about the x - axis by an angle of @xmath25 . as a consequence ,",
    "the signature @xmath26 is a good quantum number @xcite , which implies that the sm solutions represent states with the angular - momentum @xmath27 ( @xmath28 integer ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the motivation of the present work is to develop a mean - field approach in the presence of the pn - pairing .",
    "the mean - field csm approach in the case of identical particles has been quite successful to describe the rotational properties of medium and heavy mass nuclei . in the simplest form of this approach ,",
    "the mean - fields in the form of the pair - gap and the deformation are held fixed as a function of the rotational frequency . in a fully selfconsistent hartree - fock - bogolubov ( hfb ) calculation , the mean - field ( most important the pair - field ) often shows rapid changes as a function of rotational frequency that are due to the broken symmetries in the intrinsic frame of reference .",
    "the rapid changes are smeared out by projecting out the wavefunction with good quantum numbers ( most important the particle number ) . in the csm approach the problem of the `` phase transition ''",
    "is avoided , because the mean - fields are held fixed .",
    "this leads , often , to a better description than a selfconsistent hfb calculation @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to caution here that this approach has obvious limitations .",
    "it holds below a phase transition and permits a fair description of the lower part of the extended transition region . with the appropriate choice of the mean - field , the same is true for the upper region",
    "thus used with care , the csm is a robust and a simple tool to analyze the near - yrast spectra .    in subsection",
    "[ hfb.sec ] , we briefly present the hfb approach in the presence of the np - pairing .",
    "there is an extensive literature on this subject that has been reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer concerning the previous work .",
    "the hfb equations are solved selfconsistently in subsection [ hfbj.sec ] .",
    "it will be found that for low- frequency , @xmath29 the pair - field has isovector character . using this result and other studies @xcite , which also suggest the dominance of isovector pairing at low-@xmath29",
    ", we proceed with the assumption that for realistic nuclei above mass=40 , the pair - field has isovector character .",
    "the csm for such a scenario is developed in subsections [ sbiso.sec]-[csm.sec ] , where the general rules for constructing the quasiparticle spectra are given .      in the development of the csm with np - pairing ,",
    "we have employed the hfb method , details of which can be found , for instance , in refs.@xcite .",
    "the hfb equations are given by @xmath30    where @xmath31 the quantities in the brackets @xmath32 in ( [ hfbg ] ) and ( [ hfbd ] ) are the antisymmetric uncoupled matrix elements of the interaction .",
    "( [ hfbh ] ) , we have introduced the isospin label @xmath33 for neutrons and protons , respectively and rearranged the chemical potentials @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which constrain @xmath36 and @xmath37 , into @xmath38 and @xmath39 which fix mass @xmath11 and the isospin projection @xmath24 , respectively . the hfb solutions are obtained by solving the equations ( [ hfb ] ) -([hfbt ] ) selfconsistently .",
    "the pairs of states @xmath40 that define the pair - field ( [ hfbd ] ) can be rewritten in a coupled representation as @xmath41 , which explicitly indicates the isospin @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote all other quantum numbers except the isospin .",
    "for the single-@xmath45 shell model , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 are the angular - momentum and its projection , which are sufficient to fix the quantum numbers .",
    "if @xmath48 , the pair - field is an isoscalar and for @xmath49 it is an isovector . the pp - pair - field has @xmath50 and the nn- has @xmath51 .",
    "there are two pn - pair - fields with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we use the lower case letters @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the isospin of the pair - field in order to avoid confusion with the total isospin of the states , which we denote by @xmath54 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is known that in order to treat the @xmath48 and the @xmath55 fields simultaneously , it is necessary to define complex hfb potentials @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55 and @xmath48 pair - fields correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the complex pair - potential @xmath56 .",
    "the initial complex hfb wave functions are constructed by using the expressions for real and imaginary @xmath57 s and @xmath58 s of the hfb transformation in terms of the pair - gaps given in ref .",
    "no symmetry has been imposed on the hfb wavefunction since it is known that this may lead to exclusion of particular correlations @xcite .",
    "we find that the pair - field is _ either _ @xmath55 _ or _",
    "this coincides with earlier results of refs .",
    "@xcite , where in contrast to the present work , additional symmetries were imposed .",
    "hence , the mutual exclusiveness of the @xmath55 and @xmath48 pair - fields is not a consequence of these symmetries .",
    "the lack of a mixed phase can be interpreted qualitatively in the following way : since the interaction conserves isospin , it scatters pairs only into pairs with the same @xmath42 .",
    "the correlation energy is of the order of @xmath59 , with @xmath28 being the number of states the pairs can be scattered into . since the @xmath55 pairs block partially the @xmath48 phase space , and vice versa , the pure field has a larger correlation energy .    for the @xmath60 system we find a @xmath55 pair - field at low - rotational frequency @xmath29 .",
    "[ jx.fig ] shows that there is a rapid alignment at @xmath61 , where the self consistent solution changes to a @xmath48 pair - field . for the @xmath62 system",
    "we also find a @xmath55 pair - field at low- @xmath29 , which changes to a @xmath48 field at a higher frequency .",
    "the change is associated with the crossing of the @xmath8 g - band with an aligned @xmath63 odd - spin band , which will be discussed below . the change from a @xmath55 to a @xmath48 field",
    "has also been found in the hfb calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite when changing the @xmath48 strength of the np - interaction . in the case of the @xmath55 solution ,",
    "the @xmath64 fields are found to be small as compared to the monopole pair - field , @xmath65 . in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we shall consider the various aspects of the @xmath55 hfb solutions .",
    "the @xmath48 solutions have been studied separately @xcite .",
    "we only mention that the @xmath66 and @xmath67 components of the pair - fields dominate @xcite .",
    "as compared to the sm calculation , the fully selfconsistent hfb solution shows a much too early alignment and has a wrong behavior after the crossing .",
    "this is related to the fact that @xmath55 pair - field vanishes at the crossing point .",
    "the crossings frequency in even - even nuclei is determined by competition between the @xmath55 pair - field and the coriolis force . in the exact calculations , the @xmath55 pair - correlations persist to very high frequencies",
    "@xcite .      before discussing the symmetry breaking by the isovector pair - field , it is useful to state the familiar case of spontaneous breaking of the spatial isotropy by a mean - field solution with a deformed density distribution ( c.f .",
    "ref.@xcite ) .",
    "since the two - body hamiltonian is isotropic , this symmetry is broken spontaneously .",
    "there is a family of mean - field solutions with the same energy which correspond to different orientations of the density distribution .",
    "all represent one and the same intrinsic quasiparticle configuration , which is not an eigenfunction of the total angular - momentum .",
    "any of these solutions can be chosen as the intrinsic state .",
    "the principal axes of its density distribution define the body - fixed coordinate system .",
    "the states of good angular momentum are superpositions of these states of different orientations , the weight being given by the wigner @xmath68-functions .",
    "thus , the relative importance of the different orientations is fixed by restoring the angular momentum symmetry . at the simplest level of the cranking model , which is valid for sufficiently strong symmetry breaking ,",
    "the energy of the good angular momentum state is given by the mean - field value .",
    "let us now consider a @xmath55 hfb solution found for the @xmath3 system ( for example , the one discussed in the previous subsection ) .",
    "the @xmath55 pair - field @xmath69 is a vector that points in a certain direction in isospace , breaking the isospin symmetry .",
    "since the two body hamiltonian is isospin invariant , the symmetry is a spontaneously broken and all orientations of the isovector pair - field : @xmath70 are equivalent .",
    "[ delta.fig ] illustrates this family of hfb solutions , the energy of which does not depend on the orientation of the pair - field . in particular , the cases of a pure pn - field ( @xmath71 , z - axis ) and pure pp- and nn - pair fields",
    "( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , y - axis ) represent the same intrinsic state .",
    "hence , on the mean - field level the ratio between the strengths of pp- , nn- and pn - pair - fields is given by the orientation of the pair - field , which is not determined by the hfb procedure .",
    "the relative strengths of the three types of pair - correlations becomes only definite when the isospin symmetry is restored .",
    "the symmetry breaking by the isovector pair - field has been discussed before in @xcite , where references to earlier work can be found .",
    "let us first discuss the states with total isospin @xmath63 .",
    "they are isotropic superpositions of all the orientations of the pair - field , which corresponds to an equal amount of pn- , pp- and nn - correlation energy .",
    "like in the case of spatial rotation , the intrinsic excitations are constructed from the quasiparticles ( qps ) belonging to _ one _ of the orientations of pair - field .",
    "we choose the y - direction , @xmath74 .",
    "this is a particularly convenient choice because it permits to reduce the construction of the qp - excitation spectrum to the familiar case with no pn - pairing @xcite .",
    "the choice of the qp operators is not unique @xcite .",
    "we choose them to be pure quasineutrons or quasiprotons and denote their creation operators by @xmath75 , where @xmath43 indicates the isospin projection .",
    "they are pairwise degenerate , i.e. the qp routhians @xmath76 are equal .",
    "this choice has the advantage that @xmath77 = [ e^{-i\\pi n},{\\cal h } ' ] = 0,\\ ] ] and particle number parity becomes a good quantum number .",
    "the hfb vacuum state has @xmath36 and @xmath37 even .",
    "configurations with an odd or even - number of quasineutrons belong to the odd- or even-@xmath36 , respectively , and a similar thing holds for the protons .",
    "there is an alternative way to construct the @xmath82 configurations of good number parity .",
    "we start with qp operators @xmath92 of good @xmath79 , which are given by the linear combinations @xmath93 configurations of good number parity are constructed with the help of the relations @xmath94 the @xmath82 excitation @xmath95 is odd under ( [ numberparity ] ) .",
    "thus , it represents a @xmath63 state in the odd - odd nucleus .",
    "it is identical with @xmath96 . using ( [ numberparity ] ) one sees that @xmath97 and that the @xmath82 excitations @xmath98 are even and odd under ( [ numberparity ] ) , respectively .",
    "they are identical with the combinations appearing in the eqs .",
    "( [ tyeveneven ] ) and ( [ tyoddodd ] ) , as can be seen by means of direct evaluation using eqs .",
    "( [ tytz1qp ] ) .",
    "an important @xmath79=0 four qp configurations in the even - even system is @xmath99 which appears in the double - alignment process .",
    "it is noted that the number parity and @xmath79 do not commute , @xmath100 as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ numberparityty ] ) , only the eigenvalue @xmath82 is possible for states with good number parity .",
    "the @xmath101 bands are found by `` cranking in isospace '' , employing the analogy between angular momentum and isospin .",
    "the `` frequency '' @xmath102 is chosen such that .",
    "the corresponding configurations are interpreted as the states with maximal projection @xmath103 .",
    "the states with @xmath104 are the isobaric analogs , which are generated by multiple application of @xmath105 on the configuration @xmath106 , generated by cranking in isospace .",
    "they have the same energy as the state @xmath107 .",
    "since the isospin symmetry is broken spontaneously , any infinitesimal value @xmath102 in the hamiltonian ( [ hfbh ] ) fixes the orientation of the pair - field perpendicular to the z - axis , i.e. @xmath108 .",
    "this explains , why in previous hfb studies solutions with @xmath109 are found only for @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "the pn - pair - correlations appear via the isospin symmetry .",
    "the state @xmath107 can be interpreted as the pair - field being oriented in the direction of no pn - correlation .",
    "the field executes zero - point oscillations around this equilibrium orientation that represent the pn - pair correlations , because any rotation away from the y - direction introduces a pn - component in @xmath69 .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations quickly decreases with @xmath24 ( or @xmath102 ) , which explains the rapid decrease of the pn - pair correlations found in the good isospin calculations of ref .",
    "the rpa theory of these oscillations has been worked out in refs .",
    "it is shown there that these oscillations contribute the term @xmath111 to the energy .",
    "the appearance of this term is well known for spatial rotation , which obeys the same group @xmath112 .",
    "it corresponds to the familiar procedure to associate the angular momentum expectation value calculated with the cranking wavefunctions to @xmath113 ( e.g. @xcite ) or @xmath114 ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the calculations we add @xmath111 to the energy .",
    "it is likely that using the constraints , @xmath115 and @xmath116 to fix @xmath102 and @xmath117 , will give very similar results , but we have not investigated this possibility .    another way to approximately restore the symmetry corresponds to the high spin limit for spatial rotation . for the state @xmath118 ,",
    "the probability amplitude for the different orientations is given by the wigner function @xmath119 .",
    "it is seen that the amplitude of the pn - field ( @xmath120 ) goes rapidly down . for states",
    "@xmath121 the amplitude is @xmath122 , which has large contributions of the pn - field if @xmath24 is small .",
    "the excitation spectrum can be constructed in the familiar way by quasiproton and quasineutron excitations , respecting the particle number parity . unlike for the @xmath63 states ,",
    "the isospin symmetry does not exclude configurations .",
    "the reason is that the probability for @xmath123 , which corresponds to an exchange of a proton by a neutron , is zero in contrast to the case @xmath63 .",
    "nevertheless , for small @xmath24 the amplitude of the oscillations of the pair - field are substantial .",
    "this will lead to interactions between the quasiproton and quasineutron states , which will be discussed in section [ pncorr.sec ] .      in order to simplify the analysis of the excitation spectrum",
    "we shall employ the csm approximation @xcite .",
    "it consists in solving the hfb equations for the ground - state configuration at @xmath124 .",
    "the states with finite angular momentum are calculated from the qp routhians , which are the eigenvalues @xmath125 of the routhian ( [ hfbh ] ) keeping the mean - fields @xmath126 and @xmath56 fixed to their values at @xmath124 .",

    "the data on the alignment of @xmath260 particles in the mass 120 - 130 region seems to support this prediction of the theory .",
    "clearly , more detailed measurements of the rotational spectra in nuclei near @xmath0 are necessary to test this signature of the @xmath55 pn - pair correlations .",
    "another consequence of the pn - interaction is the systematic enlargement of the rotational frequency where first alignment ( ab and/or ab ) appears when the intruder shell becomes more symmetrically filled .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that this effect is generated by the @xmath8 components of the pn - interaction .",

    "the csm calculation predicts the crossing earlier than the sm .",
    "generally , the comparison with the exact sm calculations in section [ csmsm.sec ] shows that the csm approximation systematically underestimates the frequency of the alignment processes .",
    "since the protons and neutrons are assumed to independently move in a fixed rotating field , the csm can also not reproduce the delay of the the ( ab ) crossing caused by the presence of an a quasineutron , which is found in the full sm calculations and in the experiment as well @xcite , the mechanism of this effect , which seems to be of the same origin as the late alignment in @xmath0 nuclei , is still an open question .",
    "it is possible that it is caused by the part of @xmath55 pn - pair correlations that are not taken into account by the csm approximation .    in order to check this conjecture and to disentangle it from other mechanisms ( shape changes , for example ) causing similar modifications of the alignment processes ,",
    "a careful treatment of the isospin symmetry and the angular momentum dependence of the shape and pairing degrees of freedom is necessary .",
    "the example in section [ trs.sec ] demonstrates that combining the concept of spontaneous breaking of isospin symmetry with careful mean - field calculations by means of codes that take only the pp- and nn- pairing into account is expected to provide a good description of @xmath3 nuclei with a strong @xmath55 pair field .",
    "such calculations may serve as a bench mark to look for @xmath48 pair correlations .",
    "the present paper also sheds light on the results of the recent analysis of high spin data in nuclei with @xmath262 and 1 @xcite by means of the conventional mean - field approach that does not explicitly take into account the proton - neutron pairing .",
    "it is stated there that `` the agreement between theory and experiment can be considered as very good ... '' these results are consistent with our suggestion that in nuclei with @xmath263 there is strong @xmath55 pairing and we want to point out once more our most important message : the fact that the mean - field theory without an explicit pn - pair field works well does by no means imply that there is no @xmath55 pn - field . on the contrary , it must have a strength comparable with the pp- and nn - fields in order to restore the isospin symmetry .",
    "hence the other statement of the paper @xcite , `` we do not find clear evidence for collective pn - pairing ... '' must be taken literally .",
    "many features of the rotational spectra are insensitive to the presence of the pn - field , which manifests itself in a rather subtle way via isospin conservation .",
    "the discussed absence of pairs of two quasiparticle excitations ( two quasiproton and two quasineutron ) , which are expected if there was no pn - pair field , is one consequence of the pn - pairing .",

    "@xcite the consequences of the pn - pair correlations are studied by introducing a pn - pair fields , the strength of which is varied . concerning the @xmath55 pair - fields ,",
    "a free variation is inconsistent with the isospin conservation which fixes the ratios between the pn- , pp- and nn - fields .",
    "the cranked shell model mean - field approach has been extended to include @xmath55 proton - neutron pairing in order to describe nuclei near @xmath3 .",
    "the central concept encountered is the spontaneous breaking of the isospin invariance by the isovector pair - field .",
    "all orientations of the pair - field represent one and the same intrinsic state .",

    "it comes into play when interpreting the mean - field solutions as intrinsic states of the total wavefunction , with good isospin . as in the analogous case of spatial rotation and deformed mean - field solutions ,",
    "the isospin symmetry may be restored with different accuracy . in this paper",
    "we have focused on the simplest possibility , the limit of strong symmetry breaking . in this limit it is well known from spatial rotations how to connect the symmetry breaking mean - field solutions with the quantal states of good @xmath264 or @xmath54 , respectively .",

    "@xcite .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that isospin is not exactly conserved .",
    "the coulomb potential breaks this symmetry .",
    "this has the interesting consequence that the isovector pair - field does not completely rotate freely in isospace ( i.e. the wavefunction is not exactly a @xmath68 function ) , but it feels the coulomb field like an external potential , which prefers a certain orientation .",
    "this effect and other manifestations of isospin symmetry in the rotational spectra are very interesting subjects for future studies .",
    "in particular , measuring the differences between the moments of inertia and alignment processes of isobaric analog bands will shed new light on the old question of isospin purity in heavier nuclei ."
