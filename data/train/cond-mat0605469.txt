    "the possibility of exploring both charge and spin degrees of freedom in carriers has attracted the attention of the condensed matter community in recent years . the discovery of ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) like gamnas  @xcite , opened the opportunity to explore precisely such independent spin and charge manipulations .",
    "a fundamental property of diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) ( both new iii - mn - v and the more established ii - mn - vi systems ) is that a relatively small external magnetic field can cause enormous zeeman splittings of the electronic energy levels , even when the material is in the paramagnetic state  @xcite .",
    "this feature can be used in spintronics applications as it allows separating states with different spin .",
    "for instance , fiederling _ et al .",
    "_ had successfully used a ii - mn - vi dms under effect of low magnetic fields in spin - injection experiments  @xcite .",
    "another utilization of this feature has been discussed by us  @xcite : due to the giant zeeman splitting , a magnetic field with considerable spatial variation can be a very effective confining agent for spin polarized carriers in these dms systems .",
    "producing a non - uniform magnetic field with nanoscale spatial variation inside dms systems can be an experimental challenge .",
    "one option is the use of nanomagnets deposited on the top of a dms layer .",
    "in fact , nanomagnets have already been used as a source of non - homogeneous magnetic field @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , for example , have analyzed the case of a normal semiconductor in the vicinity of nanomagnets . in such case ,",
    "the non - homogeneous magnetic field modifies the exciton kinetic - energy operator and can weakly confine excitons in the semiconductor .",
    "in contrast , we have examined a dms in the vicinity of nanomagnets with a variety of shapes  @xcite . in these cases , the confinement is due the zeeman interaction which is hundreds of times stronger than the variation of kinetic - energy in dms .",
    "another possibility for obtaining the inhomogeneous magnetic fields is the use of superconductors .",
    "nanoscale field singularities appear naturally in the vortex phase of superconducting ( sc ) films . above the lower critical field b@xmath0 , in the abrikosov vortex phase , superconducting vortices",
    "populate the bulk of the sample , forming a flux lattice , each vortex carrying a quantum of magnetic flux @xmath1 .",
    "the field of a single vortex is non - uniformly distributed around a core of radius @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the coherence length ) decaying away from its maximum value at the vortex center over a length scale @xmath4 ( where @xmath4 is the penetration depth ) .    a regular two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the vicinity of superconductors in a vortex phase",
    "has already been the subject of both theoretical  @xcite and experimental studies  @xcite . in this context , because the land @xmath5 factor ( and thus the zeeman interaction ) is very small in normal semiconductors , the main consequence of the inhomogeneous magnetic fields is a change in the kinetic - energy term of the hamiltonian .",
    "the flux tubes do not produce bound states , but act basically as scattering centers  @xcite . the zeeman interaction was either neglected or treated as a small perturbation whose main consequence was to broaden the already known hofstadter butterfly subbands .    in the work presented here , we consider the case where the 2deg is confined inside a dms . due to the giant zeeman interaction in paramagnetic dmss (",
    "whose origin is briefly explained in section ii ) , the zeeman interaction becomes the dominant term in these systems , leading to appearance of _ bound states _ inside the flux tubes .",
    "these play a central role in our work and qualitatively change the nature of the magnetotransport in these systems , compared to the ones previously studied .",
    "in this article we study a sc film deposited on top of a diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum well under the influence of an external magnetic field @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , for all values of @xmath7 between the two possible asymptotic limits .",
    "for very low applied fields , the sc film is populated with few isolated vortices , each vortex producing a highly inhomogeneous magnetic field which localizes spin polarized states in the dms . in section",
    "[ isolated ] we obtain numerically the energy spectrum and the wave functions for the bound states localized by the vortex field of an isolated vortex in the dms qw .    however , the main advantage of using sc vortices to generate confining potentials in the dmss is the possibility of varying the distance between them by adjusting the external magnetic field . for increasing values of the external magnetic field @xmath7 ,",
    "the vortices in the sc are organized in a triangular lattice .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath8 is related to the applied magnetic field by @xmath9 . in this limit",
    ", the triangular vortex lattice in the sc leads to a periodically modulated magnetic field inside the neighboring dms layer .",
    "since the magnetic field produced by the sc flux lattice creates an effective spin dependent confinement potential for the carriers in the dms , the properties of the superconductors will be reflected in the energy spectrum of the dms . in particular , as the lattice spacing and spatial dependence of the non - uniform magnetic field ( our confining potentials ) change with @xmath7 , we have a peculiar system in the dms where both the lattice spacing and the depth of the potentials are modified by an applied magnetic field .    for low external magnetic fields ,",
    "the overlap between the magnetic fields of independent vortices is small and as a consequence , the giant zeeman effect produces deep effective potentials .",
    "the trapped states of the isolated vortex discussed in section [ isolated ] widen into energy bands of spin polarized states .",
    "the width of the bands is defined by the exponentially small hopping @xmath10 between neighboring trapped states . however , since the flux through each unit cell is @xmath11 , the energy bands will be those of a triangular hofstadter butterfly  @xcite .",
    "as long as the hopping @xmath10 is small compared to the spacing between consecutive trapped states , this hofstadter problem corresponds to the regime of a dominant periodic modulation , which can be treated within a simple tight - binding model @xcite and each band is expected to split into @xmath12 ( in this case , @xmath13 ) magnetic subbands .",
    "this band - structure has unique signatures in the magnetotransport , as discussed below .",
    "its measurement would provide a clear signature of the hofstadter butterfly , which is currently a matter of considerable experimental interest  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for a high applied external magnetic field @xmath7 , the magnetic fields of different vortices begin to overlap significantly . in this limit ,",
    "the total magnetic field in the dms layer is almost homogeneous .",
    "its average is @xmath14 , but it has a small additional periodic modulation ( the same effect can be achieved at a fixed @xmath7 by increasing the distance @xmath15 between the sc and dms layers ) . for such quasi - homogeneous magnetic fields , the zeeman interaction can no longer induce trapping ; instead it reverts to its traditional role of lifting the spin degeneracy .",
    "the small periodic modulation insures the fact that the system still corresponds to a @xmath16 hofstadter butterfly , but now in the other asymptotic limit , namely that of a weak periodic modulation . in this case",
    ", each landau level is expected to split into @xmath17 subbands , with a bandwidth controlled by the amplitude of the weak modulation .",
    "the case @xmath18 has @xmath19 and there are no additional gaps in the bandstructure . as a result ,",
    "one expects to see the usual iqhe in magnetotransport in this regime . to summarize",
    ", as long as there is a vortex lattice , the setup corresponds to a @xmath18 hofstadter butterfly irrespective of the value of external magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "instead , @xmath7 controls the amplitude of the periodic modulation , from being the large energy scale ( small @xmath7 ) to being a small perturbation ( large @xmath7 ) .    in section [ 2d ]",
    ", we use a unified theoretical approach to analyze how the 2-d modulated magnetic field produced by the vortex lattice affects the free carries in the dms qw , and the resulting bandstructures .",
    "we obtain the energy spectrum going from the asymptotic limit of a very small periodic modulation to the asymptotic limit of isolated vortices . in the later case ,",
    "we are able to reproduce the results obtained in the section iii .    as one of the most direct signatures of the hofstadter butterfly , in section [ iqhe ] we discuss the fingerprints of the band structures obtained in section [ 2d ] on the magnetotransport properties of these 2deg , in particular their hall ( transversal ) conductance .",
    "this is shown to change significantly as one tunes the external magnetic field between the two asymptotic limits .",
    "finally , in section vi we discuss the significance of these results .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of the dms is the giant zeeman effect they exhibit in their paramagnetic state , with effective land factors of the charge carriers on the order of 10@xmath20 - 10@xmath21 .",
    "since this effect plays a key role in determining the phenomenology we analyze in this work , we briefly review its origin in this section , using a simple mean - field picture .",
    "the exchange interaction of an electron with the impurity spins @xmath22 located at positions @xmath23 , is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the exchange interaction . within a mean - field approximation ( justified since each carrier interacts with many impurity spins )",
    "@xmath26 , and the average exchange energy felt by the electron becomes : @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the molar fraction of mn dopants , @xmath29 is the number of unit cells per unit volume , @xmath30 is the average expectation value of the mn spins , and @xmath31 is an integral over one unit cell , with @xmath32 being the periodic part of the conduction band bloch wave - functions . the usual virtual crystal approximation , which averages over all possible location of mn impurities , has been used .",
    "exchange fields for holes can be found similarly ; they are somewhat different due to the different valence - band wave - functions .    in a ferromagnetic dms",
    ", this terms explains the appearance of a finite magnetization below @xmath33 : as the mn spins begin to polarize , @xmath34 , this exchange interaction induces a polarization of the charge carrier spins @xmath35 . in turn , exchange terms like @xmath36 further polarize the mn , until self - consistency is reached .    in paramagnetic dms , however ,",
    "@xmath37 and charge carrier states are spin - degenerate .",
    "the spin - degeneracy can be lifted if an external magnetic field @xmath38 is applied .",
    "of course , the usual zeeman interaction @xmath39 is present , although this is typically very small . much more important",
    "is the indirect coupling of the charge carrier spin to the external magnetic field , mediated by the mn spins .",
    "the origin of this is the exchange energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , and the fact that in an external magnetic field , the impurity spins acquire a finite polarization @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the value of the impurity spins ( @xmath43 for mn ) and @xmath44 is the brillouin function ( for simplicity of notation , we assume the same bare @xmath5-factor for both charge carriers and mn spins ; also , here we neglect the supplementary contribution coming from the @xmath36 terms , since typically an impurity spin interacts with few charge carriers ) .",
    "the total spin - dependent interaction of the charge - carriers is , then :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 for electrons , with an equivalent expression for holes . for low magnetic fields ,",
    "@xmath47 becomes independent of the value of @xmath48 , although it is a function of @xmath49 and @xmath28 .",
    "its large effective value is primarily due to the strong coupling @xmath50 ( large @xmath51 ) between charge carriers and mn spins .    in the calculations shown here , we use as dms parameters an effective charge - carrier mass @xmath52 and @xmath53 , unless otherwise specified .",
    "such values are reasonable for holes in several dms , such as gamnas and cdmnte .",
    "in this section we discuss the case where the free carriers in a narrow dms quantum well are subjected to the magnetic field created by a single sc vortex .",
    "this situation is relevant for very low applied fields , when the density of sc vortices is very low .",
    "we first need to know the magnetic field induced by the sc vortex in the dms qw . for an isotropic superconductor ,",
    "this problem was solved by pearl @xcite .",
