    "fluid - solid interaction problems involving moving interfaces have been studied intensively during the last two decades .",
    "the interaction with elastic solids has proven to be particularly difficult , due to apparent regularity incompatibilities between the parabolic fluid phase and the hyperbolic or dispersive solid phase .",
    "therefore , the first results in this direction involved damped or regularized elasticity laws ; see for instance @xcite and the references therein . in particular , in @xcite the global - in - time existence of weak solutions for the interaction of an incompressible , newtonian fluid with a damped kirchhoff - love plate is shown .",
    "the first results involving the classical elasticity laws without any regularisation are @xcite where the local - in - time existence of a unique solution for an incompressible , newtonian fluid interacting with linear and quasilinear three - dimensional elasticity , respectively , is shown . here",
    ", the data is assumed to be very smooth .",
    "similar results are shown in @xcite where the interaction of an incompressible , newtonian fluid with two - dimensional nonlinearly elastic structures , so - called shells , constituting the mathematical boundary of the three - dimensional fluid domain , is analyzed . however , in both papers inertia had to be neglected in the three - dimensional case , leading to parabolic - elliptic systems . in @xcite",
    "the added damping term is mainly needed in the proof of compactness of sequences of approximate weak solutions .",
    "the subsequent work @xcite introduces a technique which allows to get rid of this damping term . in both papers",
    "the compactness argument relies on the strategy to test the system with difference quotients in time .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that this argument rests heavily upon the simple flat geometry of the elastic plate . in particular",
    ", it seems to be very difficult to apply it to the case of a general shell which is the problem we are interested in . for this reason ,",
    "in the present paper we introduce a completely new approach to this compactness problem which is closely related to the classical aubin - lions theorem .",
    "the present paper summarizes results from daniel lengeler s ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite .",
    "it is organized as follows . in subsection 1.1",
    "we introduce koiter s energy for elastic shells , in subsection 1.2 we introduce the coupled fluid - shell system , and in subsection 1.3 we derive formal a - priori estimates for this system . in section 2",
    "we derive some results concerning domains with non - lipschitz boundaries .",
    "then , in section 3 we state the main result of the paper .",
    "the rest of the section is devoted to the proof of this result . in subsection 3.1",
    "we give the proof of compactness of sequences of weak solutions .",
    "subsequently , in subsection 3.2 we analyse a decoupled variant of our original system , while in subsection 3.3 we apply a fixed - point argument to this decoupled system . in subsection 3.4",
    "we conclude the proof by letting the regularisation parameter , which we introduced earlier , tend to zero .",
    "finally , some further results and technical computations can be found in the appendix .      throughout the paper ,",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded , non - empty domain of class @xmath1 with outer unit normal @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 and @xmath4 the first and the second fundamental form of @xmath5 , induced by the ambient euclidean space , and by @xmath6 the surface measure of @xmath5 .",

    "let @xmath5 represent the middle surface of an elastic shell of thickness @xmath11 in its rest state , where @xmath12 is taken to be small compared to the reciprocal of the principal curvatures .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the elastic shell consists of a homogeneous , isotropic material whose linear elastic behavior may be characterized by the lam constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we shall describe deformations of the middle surface and hence of the shell by a vector field @xmath15 vanishing at the boundary @xmath16 . hence , we assume the part @xmath17 of the middle surface to be fixed . letting @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the pullback of the first and second fundamental form , respectively , of the deformed middle surface , the elastic energy of the deformation may be modeled by _ koiter s energy for a nonlinearly elastic shell _ @xmath20 see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein . here",
    "@xmath21 is the elasticity tensor of the shell , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the differences of the first and the second fundamental forms , respectively . in @xcite",
    "this energy is derived from three - dimensional elasticity under the additional assumptions of small strains and plane stresses parallel to the middle surface . the part of the energy scaling with @xmath12 is the membrane energy , the part scaling with @xmath24 is the bending energy . for a rigorous justification of this energy",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "motivated by the approach in @xcite , we restrict the deformation of the middle surface to displacements along the unit normal field @xmath2 of @xmath10 . hence , the displacement @xmath25 may be described by a scalar function @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , we linearize the dependence of the strain tensors @xmath27 and @xmath28 on @xmath26 at @xmath29 , resulting in the tensor fields ) by @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , we write @xmath31 for the associated laplace operator . ]",

    "using integration by parts and taking into account some facts from riemannian geometry one can show that the @xmath39 gradient of this energy has the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a second order differential operator which vanishes on flat parts of @xmath10 , i.e. where @xmath42 .",

    "we denote by @xmath50 , @xmath51 , the deformed domain ( cf .  ) and by @xmath52 the deformed spacetime cylinder .",

    "@xmath67 is the no - slip condition in the case of a moving boundary , i.e. the velocity of the fluid at the boundary equals the velocity of the boundary .",
    "the force exerted by the fluid on the boundary is given by the evaluation of the stress tensor at the deformed boundary in the direction of the inner normal @xmath68 , i.e. by @xmath69 thus , the equation for the displacement of the shell takes the form @xmath70 where @xmath3 is an additional force density and @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "finally , we specify initial values @xmath73 in the following we will analyse the system , , .",
    "let us now formally derive energy estimates for this parabolic - dispersive system . to this end",
