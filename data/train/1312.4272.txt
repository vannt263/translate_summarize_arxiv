    "thus the hybrid functional scheme and the lda+@xmath0 approach could be regarded as alternative means@xcite for fixing inaccuracies of the semilocal density approximations , which result from insufficient localization of @xmath7 electrons .",
    "indeed , it has recently been proposed@xcite to derive the value of @xmath0 from hybrid functional calculations . in contrast",
    ", we think it is appropriate to adopt a perspective where the hybrid - functional and dft+@xmath0 methods are treated _ complementary _ ( inasmuch as they both reduce the static correlation energy ) , which led us to combine hybrid functionals with the hubbard @xmath0 . from a different point of view",
    ", this means that one of the two methods ( dft+@xmath0 ) is utilized to reduce the _",
    "residual _ self - interaction error@xcite of the other one ( hybrid - functional ) , which is pragmatically justified .",
    "furthermore , ivdy _ et al . _ ( ref .  ) have recently shown that a hybrid exchange - correlation potential could be cast into a mathematical form that is reminiscent of the on - site hubbard potential for a subsystem of _ localized _ orbitals , providing theoretical justification for our methodology : an additional on - site ( dft+@xmath0 ) potential is added to the hybrid exchange - correlation potential , which is applied _ only _ to strictly localized states .",
    "this improves the physical description because localized @xmath7-band states and delocalized crystal states are differentiated in the hybrid - functional+@xmath0 approach , which are indifferent to the hybrid functional itself .",
    "it is also interesting in this regard to point out that the dft+@xmath0 and hybrid - functional methods could both be regarded as approximations to the @xmath8 method,@xcite as articulated in refs .   and , respectively .",
    "the incentive of using these two methods together is then to increase the level of approximation , provided that they are complementary .",
    "it is usually necessary to perform a calibration@xcite for the value of @xmath0 that is _ optimal _ with respect to the material properties under consideration . besides @xmath0 is not only element - specific@xcite but also material - specific.@xcite",
    "thus it is appealing to employ a hybrid functional with an exchange mixing coefficient @xmath3 that is in practice fixed to a single _ universal _ value , e.g. , @xmath9 in both global@xcite and range - separated heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof@xcite ( hse ) hybrid functionals .",
    "it should , however , be noted that setting the optimal value for @xmath3 as @xmath10 in ref .   was accomplished",
    "_ empirically _",
    "( via error analysis of the atomization energies ) , which would not necessarily be optimal for _ other _ material properties.@xcite we found , in line with earlier reports,@xcite that the hybrid ( hse ) functional calculations with @xmath9 improve the prediction of both the @xmath7 band position @xmath11 relative to the valence band maximum and the band gap @xmath12 but these improvements are not sufficient to make the predictions agree with the experimental data .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ egcalvsexp ] for zinc and cadmium monochalcogenides , where the calculated and measured values of @xmath12 ( left panel ) and @xmath11 ( right panel ) are plotted with respect to each other .",
    "figure  [ egcalvsexp](a ) shows that ( i ) the improvement for the band gap is impressive for systems with a somewhat small band gap , and ( ii ) the band gap is _ still _ significantly underestimated for wide band gap semiconductors such as zno . as explored in appendix ,",
    "both the gga band gap error @xmath13 and the hse correction @xmath14 are inversely proportional to the high - frequency dielectric constant @xmath15 so that @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where the constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 satisfy @xmath20 .",
    "owing to the latter , the hse improvement falls short for materials with relatively small dielectric constant ( with the exception of cdo for which the hse calculation yields the right direct and indirect band gaps , cf . ref .  ) .",
    "figure  [ egcalvsexp](b ) shows that the hse - calculated @xmath11 is _ still _ too high although there is a significant correction of about @xmath21  ev .",
    "it should be noted that the prediction of @xmath11 could further be improved by adding a hubbard @xmath0 term to the hybrid functional , which would enable one to adjust the @xmath7 band position .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the measured values of @xmath11 could indeed be reproduced by using adjusted @xmath0 values , cf .",
    "fig . 3 of ref .  , in the case of zinc monochalcogenides .",
    "these observations also motivate us to treat the hybrid functional scheme and the dft+@xmath0 method as _ complementary _ rather than _ alternative _ approaches .",
    "accordingly , we propose here to combine the screened hybrid functional of heyd , scuseria , and ernzerhof with the hubbard @xmath0 .",
    "the main advantage of the latter is that strictly localized and delocalized states are _ screened differently _ since _ only _ the former are subject to an additional on - site ( dft+@xmath0 ) potential.@xcite in contrast , localized and delocalized states are indifferent to the original hse functional as long as the same set of parameters , viz .",
    "the exchange mixing coefficient @xmath3 and the screening parameter @xmath22 , are used for _ all _ states .",
    "additionally , we regard @xmath0 as a semiempirical parameter , in line with the perspective@xcite that the hubbard term added to the density functionals is essentially a phenomenological many - body correction .",
    "our findings show that the hse+@xmath0 calculations performed by using an _ adjusted _ @xmath0 value reproduce the measured band gap and , at the same time , result in an improved physical description not only of the electronic structure but also of the crystal structure and energetics for the semiconductors with localized @xmath7 electrons .",
    "this is obviously very convenient for practical purposes such as setting the range of the electron chemical potential accurately in the point defect calculations , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "it is also very convenient because it enables one to employ the measured @xmath12 , instead of @xmath11 , in setting the @xmath0 value .",
    "note that there is usually some scatter in the measured data for @xmath11 , which partly reflects the fact that the width of the @xmath7 bands is nonzero no matter how localized the states are .",
    "the underestimation of the band gap in the hse calculations , cf .",
    "[ egcalvsexp](a ) , could partially be attributed to lacking the correlation part of the discontinuity of the exchange - correlation potential.@xcite similarly , the discontinuity of the exchange - correlation potential is not fully restored in the lda / gga+@xmath0 calculations even though the @xmath0 term added to the density functionals yields a discontinuous contribution.@xcite it should also be commented that setting the right value of @xmath0 _ empirically _ is not straightforward because one needs to take accounts of hybridization and screening of @xmath7 electrons _ a priori_. furthermore , the measured value of @xmath12 could not be reproduced no matter how large a value of @xmath0 is used in the lda+@xmath0 calculations performed for zinc monochalcogenides , cf .",
    "fig . 3 of ref .  .",
    "our study provides a resolution to this difficulty with the aid of hybrid functional , and proves that an adequate @xmath0 value could be determined by simply matching the experimental band gap .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the next section is devoted to the method of calculation , which also summarizes the computational details .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the calculation results before concluding remarks given in the last section .",
    "all calculated properties reported here were obtained via semilocal or hybrid dft calculations using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof@xcite ( pbe ) or heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof@xcite ( hse ) functionals , respectively . in the hybrid functional calculations , we employed the hse06@xcite functional by setting the screening parameter@xcite @xmath23 @xmath24 ( and exchange mixing coefficient @xmath25 as implied in section  [ giris ] ) . in the hse+@xmath0 calculations we used the simplified ( rotationally invariant )",
    "approach@xcite where the difference between the on - site coulomb @xmath26 and exchange @xmath27 parameters is employed as the _ effective _ hubbard parameter @xmath28 .",
    "we performed a variety of calculations for zinc and cadmium monochalcogenides by employing the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method,@xcite as implemented in vasp code.@xcite the 2s and 2p , 3s and 3p , 4s and 4p , 5s and 5p , 3d and 4s , and 4d and 5s states are treated as valence states for oxygen , sulfur , selenium , tellurium , zinc , and cadmium , respectively .",
    "plane wave basis sets were used to represent the electronic states , which were determined by imposing a kinetic energy cutoff of 520 ev for the systems that include oxygen atoms and 400 ev for the rest of the systems .",
    "we first carried out optimization of the crystal structures where concurrent relaxations of the cell volume and shape as well as the ionic positions were performed until the total energy was converged within 1 mev and the maximum value of residual forces on atoms was reduced to be smaller than 0.01 ev /  . in these optimizations , we used the primitive unit cells of the crystals , whose brillouin zones were sampled by @xmath29 ( for the crystals with wurtzite structure ) or @xmath30 or @xmath31 ( for the crystals with rocksalt and zincblende structures ) * k*-point meshes generated according to monkhorst - pack scheme,@xcite enabling us to achieve convergence of the energy within 1 mev / atom . using the optimized crystal structures",
    ", we then performed band - structure and density - of - states calculations in order to obtain the band gap @xmath12 and the @xmath7 band position @xmath11 , respectively . besides we performed geometry optimizations for the o@xmath32 and s@xmath33 molecules and the bulk solids of se , te , zn , and cd , and employed the respective equilibrium total energies in the computation of the formation energy @xmath34 .",
    "as indicated in section  [ giris ] , we set the value of @xmath0 by reproducing the experimental value of the band gap in the hse+@xmath0 calculations , which is justified in section  [ sonuclar ] .",
    "thus , we carried out the hse+@xmath0 calculations for a range of @xmath0 values , and studied the calculated band gap as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "since our results showed that the variation of the band gap with @xmath0 is virtually linear , we performed a linear fit to obtain the value of @xmath0 that corresponds to the measured band gap .",
    "the value of @xmath0 obtained via this procedure , which is _ optimal _ in reproducing the experimental value of the band gap , is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the hse+@xmath0 calculation that yields the experimental , i.e. , _ targeted _ , value of the band gap is named here as the hse+@xmath1 calculation .",
    "it should be mentioned that the hse band energy differences depend on the value of the screening parameter @xmath22 , which is not necessarily universal .",
    "it was , however , demonstrated@xcite that @xmath23 @xmath24 as used in hse06 is an average optimal value for which the band energy differences approximate rather accurately _ quasiparticle excitation energies _ , for a variety of semiconductors .",
    "therefore , the hse band energy differences are often _ directly _ compared to the experimental band gaps@xcite ( e.g. , in order to demonstrate@xcite the success of the hse calculations in reproducing the experimental band gaps ) .",
    "in addition to this , as long as the hse+@xmath0 approach could be regarded as an approximation to the @xmath8 method , it would be preferential to use the quasiparticle energy differences ( the @xmath8-calculated band gaps ) in our procedure for setting the value of @xmath1 .",
    "however , the @xmath8-calculated band gaps are usually in good agreement with the experimental band gaps ( e.g. , ref .  ) . it should , on the other hand , be also noted that the @xmath8@hse calculations _ overestimate _ the band gap of a number of semiconductors including cds and zns ( ref .  ) .",
    "hence , we preferred to utilize the experimental band gaps instead of the @xmath8-calculated energy differences , which is also convenient from a practical point of view since it enables one to avoid performing quasiparticle calculations that might easily become computationally exhaustive , especially for large - scale ( e.g. , defect ) calculations .",
    "we first quantify the relationship between the band gap error @xmath35 in the gga and hse calculations and the position of @xmath7 level in the case of zinc and cadmium chalcogenides since the latter is , in effect , adjusted by varying the value of @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ degvsdepd](a ) shows a plot of @xmath35 versus the difference @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the @xmath39- and @xmath7-state energies of the chalcogen and metal atoms , respectively . in zinc and cadmium chalcogenides",
    ", the @xmath7 band is located below and next to the topmost valence band.@xcite thus , the valence - band maximum turns out to be _ above _ its actual position if the metal @xmath7 states are positioned _ too _ high ( as in both the gga and hse calculations ) , which contributes to the underestimation of the band gap . the difference @xmath40 is therefore used here to quantify the relationship between the band gap error and the position of @xmath7 level . in fig .",

    "the difference @xmath40 is further increased in the hse+@xmath0 calculations , reducing the band gap error further .",
    "having @xmath45 in this trend makes @xmath35 vanish , with adequate increase of @xmath40 .",
    "it is seen in table  [ tablo ] that the larger @xmath12 the greater @xmath1 ( with few exceptions ) .",

    "<S> in the density - functional studies of materials with _ localized _ electronic states , the local / semilocal exchange - correlation functionals are often either combined with a hubbard parameter @xmath0 as in the lda+@xmath0 method or mixed with a fraction of exactly computed ( fock ) exchange energy yielding a hybrid functional . although some inaccuracies of the semilocal density approximations are thus fixed to a certain extent , the improvements are not sufficient to make the predictions agree with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> here we put forward the perspective that the hybrid functional scheme and the lda+@xmath0 method should be treated as _ complementary _ , and propose to combine the range - separated ( hse ) hybrid functional with the hubbard @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus present a variety of hse+@xmath0 calculations for a set of ii - vi semiconductors , consisting of zinc and cadmium monochalcogenides , along with comparison to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> our findings imply that an _ optimal _ </S>",
    "<S> value @xmath1 of the hubbard parameter could be determined , which ensures that the hse+@xmath1 calculation reproduces the experimental band gap . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that an improved description not only of the electronic structure but also of the crystal structure and energetics is obtained by adding the @xmath1 term to the hse functional , proving the utility of hse+@xmath1 approach in modeling semiconductors with localized electronic states . </S>"
