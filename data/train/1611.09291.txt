    "cheng in @xcite has presented @xmath37-time algorithms that compute the distinguishing numbers of trees and forests .",
    "the distinguishing number of graphs have been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "the following general problem appeared in @xcite :    characterize graphs with distinguishing number two .    in this paper , we obtain all trees with radius at most two and distinguishing number two . also we state a note on the trees of radius greater than two and finally pose a problem .",
    "to obtain all trees with radius at most two and distinguishing number two , we need some preliminaries :      let @xmath1 be a graph .",
    "a cycle @xmath39 in @xmath1 is said to be locally geodesic at a vertex @xmath11 if for each vertex @xmath12 on @xmath39 , the distance between @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath39 coincides with that in @xmath1 .",
    "* @xmath1 is isomorphic to the complete bipartite graph @xmath40 @xmath41 ; * @xmath1 is @xmath42-self - centered ; * @xmath1 is a block and for each vertex @xmath11 of @xmath1 , there is no cycle locally geodesic at @xmath11 and of length more than @xmath43 .      *",

    "the following theorem characterizes edge - minimal @xmath42-self - centered graphs with triangles , which completes the characterization of all 2-self - centered graphs .",
    "* for each edge of every triangle in @xmath1 , at least one end - vertex is a critical vertex ( for the other end - vertex of that edge and some other vertices of @xmath1 ) , and * iteration of above procedure on @xmath1 ( at most to the number of triangles of @xmath1 ) transforms @xmath1 to a triangle - free @xmath42-self - centered graph .",
    "the sequential join @xmath50 , of graphs @xmath51 , is formed from @xmath52 , by adding the additional edges joining each vertex of @xmath53 with each vertex of @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the double star @xmath56 is the tree @xmath57 , and the tritip @xmath58 is the graph formed by adding @xmath59 , and @xmath60 pendant edges at the vertices of @xmath61 , see @xcite .",
    "@xcite[theorem7 ] .",
    "let @xmath1 be a self - centered graph with @xmath62 vertices and diameter two , having as few edges as possible among such graphs .",
    "then @xmath1 is one of the following ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) :    * the petersen graph , * the graph formed from @xmath56 by adding an additional vertex @xmath12 and joining @xmath12 to each vertex of degree 1 in @xmath56 . *",

    "it is well known that a tree either has one center ( i.e. , it is unicentral ) or has two adjacent centers ( i.e. , it is bicentral ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath72 has a unique center , simply let @xmath66 be a copy of @xmath72 ; otherwise , let @xmath66 be the tree formed by appending a new vertex to the two centers of @xmath72 and deleting the edge between the two old centers of @xmath72 . in both cases , @xmath66 has a unique center which we designate as its root @xmath74 .",
    "so for obtaining all trees with radius at most two and the distinguishing number two it is sufficient to consider all rooted trees of radius at most two with distinguishing number two . only with respect to the degree of the root",

    "if @xmath66 is a tree of order @xmath33 with radius @xmath83 and @xmath77 , then the radius of the complement of @xmath66 is @xmath84 . by theorem [ thmrad ] , @xmath85 , and then @xmath67 by theorem [ theorem3.3 ] .",
    "it is known that the complement of a tree is connected or it is a union of an isolated vertex and a complete graph .",
    "if @xmath70 is a union of an isolated vertex and a complete graph , then @xmath66 is a star graph , and since @xmath77 so @xmath86 .",
    "but @xmath85 , thus there is no tree with distinguishing number two in this case .",
    "therefore @xmath70 is a connected @xmath42-self - centered graph that is not bipartite by corollary [ corollary7 ] and theorem [ theorem3.3 ] .",
    "@xmath75    by theorem [ geq4 ] , for finding all trees with @xmath87 and @xmath77 , we should only consider the @xmath42-self - centered trees that are not bipartite .",
    "but buckley in @xcite obtained all @xmath42-self - centered graphs having as few edges as possible among such graphs . since @xmath66 is a tree , so @xmath70 is not an edge - minimal @xmath42-self - centered graph by theorem [ theorem15 ] .",
    "thus we should add a specific number of edges to each edge - minimal @xmath42-self - centered graph so that we get @xmath70 .",
