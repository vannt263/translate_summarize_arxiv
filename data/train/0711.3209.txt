    "x - ray observations have shown that hot gas in groups and clusters of galaxies has been heated by some sources in addition to gravity .",
    "this was shown by the fact that the luminosity and temperature of a group or cluster follow a scaling relationship ( the @xmath3@xmath4 relation ) , @xmath5 , @xcite , which is at odds with that expected for groups and clusters formed by gravitational structure formation , with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown that the entropies of the hot gas in groups and clusters , especially groups , are higher than those predicted by models of gravitational structure formation @xcite .",
    "supernova - driven galactic winds have been considered the heating source @xcite .",
    "however , the energy from supernovae alone seems to be insufficient to heat the hot gas to the observed level @xcite .",
    "therefore , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are now recognised as another promising candidate of the heating source @xcite .",
    "agns are often found at the centres of groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "the energy ejected by an agn can cancel radiative cooing of the hot gas and may prevent development of a cooling flow in the central region of a group or a cluster . for most of the agns at @xmath7 , however , the power is not enough to heat the hot gas on a group or cluster - scale , and would be insufficient to account for the entropy excess found in groups and clusters .",
    "recently , however , shock waves associated with extremely powerful agn outbursts have been found in some clusters @xcite .",
    "they seem to be powerful enough to heat the gas on a group or cluster - scale .",
    "such strong outbursts would also affect the surrounding environment in a form other than heating .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the shock wave excited by an outburst accelerates particles and that the emission from the accelerated particles could be responsible for radio mini - halos observed in clusters .",

    "another interaction between the hot gas and the galaxies , called ram - pressure stripping , is effective ( see section  [ sec : discuss ] ) .",
    "thus , the influence of agn outbursts would be obscured .",

    "[ fig : z0](a ) and [ fig : z2](a ) indicate that the effect of the ram - pressure stripping can be ignored .",
    "this means that the stripping by a shock wave overwhelms the usual ram - pressure stripping in groups .",

    "even if @xmath104 , the shock wave would affect the evolution of a galaxy .",
    "it is often assumed that the cold ism in the disc of a galaxy is supplied from the warm gas in the halo .",
    "if most of the gas in the halo is stripped , the ism in the disc is gradually consumed through star formation without supply .",
    "this is followed by gradual decrease of star formation activity of the galaxy , which is often called ` strangulation ' and is considered to be associated with the evolution of galaxies in galaxy groups @xcite . from x - ray observations , @xcite actually detected the halo gas in a massive galaxy ngc  5746 .",
    "however , the rotation velocity of the galaxy is very large ( @xmath105 ) and the result could not apply to the galaxy we consider here ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "therefore , we use the results of the observations of ngc  5170 ( @xmath107 ) for which the halo gas was not detected @xcite .    for our cosmological parameters ,",
    "the upper limit of the mass of the halo gas is @xmath108 @xcite . assuming that the halo gas resides in a cylinder of a base radius of 38  kpc @xcite , the column density in the direction of the height is @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , we assume that the column density of the halo gas is @xmath110 and @xmath111 as equation ( [ eq : sig_ism ] ) .",
    "since @xmath112 for our model galaxy , the halo gas would be stripped even when @xmath113 or smaller .    for @xmath114 , fig .",
    "[ fig : z0](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : z2](b ) show that @xmath115 up to the virial radius of the group ( 560  kpc for @xmath69 and 230  kpc for @xmath82 ) .",
    "thus , most galaxies in the group would be affected by the outburst of the central agn .",
    "even if @xmath116 , the influence of the agn outburst can not be ignored for @xmath117 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : z2_01]b ) .",
    "after the cold ism ( or the halo gas ) is stripped by the outburst , the colour of the galaxies would become red due to the lack of star formation .",
    "some of the galaxies would be observed as passive spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". some would also fall into the group centre through dynamical friction , and eventually merge with the central galaxy in which the agn responsible for the outburst resides .",
    "since the fallen galaxies no longer have ism , they do not supply gas to the supermassive black hole in the agn .",
    "thus , the outburst would serve as a kind of feedback mechanism for the growth and activity of the black hole .    at low redshift , radio and x - ray observations",
    "indicate that the stripping by agn outbursts may not be common . after the outburst , the x - ray luminosities of the groups we considered reduce to @xmath118% of the initial values and become @xmath119 for @xmath120 . here",
    ", we do not integrate the luminosities up to @xmath19 , because it is difficult to detect x - ray in the outermost regions of groups @xcite .",
    "the luminosities of the igm after the outburst are smaller than those of groups from which x - ray emission from the igm has been detected ( @xmath121 ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the stripping by agn outbursts were common , the lack of cold ism in galaxies should be confirmed more in groups lacking for x - ray emission .",
    "however , radio ( hi ) and x - ray observations of nearby groups showed the opposite trend @xcite , although the cause is not known .    on the other hand , we suppose that the stripping by agn outbursts occurred more often at high redshift ( say @xmath122 ) .",
    "this is because strong outbursts were more common at that time .",
    "for example , radio observations showed that there are a number of agns with the jet power of @xmath123 at @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "considering typical duration of an agn activity ( @xmath125@xmath126  yr ; @xcite ) , the total energy injected through an activity is @xmath127  erg .",
    "moreover , it has been indicated that luminous agns tend to be found at higher redshifts ( @xmath122 ) in comparison with less luminous agns @xcite .",
    "furthermore , optical observations often found clustering of red galaxies around radio galaxies at @xmath128 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the activities of the radio galaxies might have affected the star formation of the surrounding galaxies as we predict . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", @xcite indicated that strong agn outbursts at @xmath128 blew out the igm from groups ( ancestors of present - day groups or clusters ) , and they could be responsible for the low metal abundance observed in groups ( @xmath129 ) at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "although these studies do not directly prove the stripping by agn outbursts , they are at least consistent with our model . in the future , galaxies lack of cold gas would be observed inside the cocoon or the shock produced by an outburst .",
    "we have investigated the influence of an agn outburst at the centre of a galaxy group on the galaxies surrounding the agn . if the energy of the agn is extremely large ( @xmath130 ) as the one recently observed in clusters , the shock wave excited by the outburst strips the cold ism in the disc of the surrounding galaxies locating at @xmath131200  kpc from the agn .",
    "the effect of the stripping can be much stronger than that of usual ram - pressure stripping owing to the motion of the galaxies in a group . however , the stripping of the cold ism in the disc is not effective if @xmath132 .",
    "we also showed that even if the cold ism in the disc of the galaxies is not stripped , the warm gas in the halo would be stripped by the shock wave .",
    "this could be effective for the whole galaxies in the group up to the virial radius even when @xmath133 .",
    "the star formation activities of those galaxies would decrease gradually because the ism consumed by the star formation is not compensated from the gas in the halo ( strangulation ) .",
    "our results indicate that even one strong agn outburst significantly affects the evolution of galaxies in groups .",
    "after the stripping , the galaxies should become red because of the decrease of the star formation rate .",
    "the success of this model depends on the assumption of an extremely strong outburst . since such outbursts",
    "have not been observed in galaxy groups at low - redshift , the stripping by them would not have strong influence on the evolution of galaxies at low - redshift .",
    "however , we suppose that it would be at high redshift where extremely strong agn activities have often been observed .",
