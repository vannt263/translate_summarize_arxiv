    "neutrino oscillations have been experimentally observed in a variety of situations , and are among the first evidence of physics beyond the standard model . typically , these oscillations are explained by attributing mass to neutrinos ; however , not all experiments can be explained using the same masses - notably , lsnd@xcite and miniboone@xcite require a larger mass - squared difference than the other experiments , and can not be explained using a three - flavor theory of mass .",
    "furthermore , recent results at minos and miniboone have hinted at an asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos @xcite , which would be evidence for lorentz violation .",
    "it has already been shown that models incorporating lorentz violations can reproduce many of the results of the mass model@xcite .",
    "examples include the bicycle model@xcite and the tandem model@xcite . here",
    ", a new model is introduced to attempt to explain these experiments .",

    "note that mass does not appear because it enters only at second order .",
    "such a hamiltonian allows many unusual features , including neutrino - antineutrino mixing , neutrino - sterile neutrino mixing , strange energy dependence and direction dependence .",
    "we propose a tricycle model , in which we assume that @xmath6 so that the off - diagonal terms can be ignored .",
    "this allows us to restrict our attention to one quadrant of the matrix , the @xmath7 sector ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "note that we have only considered the isotropic part of each of the lorentz - violating coefficients .",
    "in particular , the model to be investigated has the form @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is taken to be hermitian and @xmath10 and @xmath11 commute , so that they can be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "we assume that the diagonalizing matrix has the conventional form@xcite @xmath12\\ ] ] ( we are assuming that @xmath13 ) . the model is then fixed by 8 parameters : the two mixing angles and the three eigenvalues of each block , which we call @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are @xmath16    the model employs a seesaw mechanism to produce very different behavior at high and low energies . at high energy the @xmath17 matrix dominates , which cuts off left - right oscillations and allows the left - handed neutrinos to oscillate among themselves as normal . at low energies ,",
    "however , the @xmath10 terms dominate , and oscillations into sterile neutrinos are predicted . observe that @xmath18 so that three of the eigenvalues have the expected @xmath19 energy dependence at high energies .",
    "transition probabilities can be calculated exactly .",
    "for example , @xmath20\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21\\ ] ] and @xmath22\\ ] ]    the mixing angles and two of the eigenvalues are determined by the high - energy , mass - like behavior widely detected .",
    "there remain four independent parameters in the model , which can be adjusted to control the low energy behavior without disrupting the high - energy limit . as energy decreases ,",
    "the probabilities diverge smoothly from the standard mass predictions .",
    "the model introduced above ( 6 ) will never produce observable cpt violations .",
    "this is because @xmath10 is a cpt - odd variable , but @xmath11 is cpt - even , so that under cpt transformations , @xmath23 goes to @xmath24\\ ] ] however , the eigenvalues and mixing angles on which the probability depends do not observe the sign of @xmath10 , as can be seen from their definitions ( 8 , 11 , 12 ) .",
    "this causes the probabilities to be the same whether @xmath10 or @xmath25 is used .",
    "in fact , even if @xmath10 does not commute with @xmath11 , cpt symmetry will still be preserved ; to introduce cpt violation , @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms must be mixed ( for example , an ordinary rotation of ( 6 ) will introduce cpt violations ) .",
    "this model is intended to show that behavior typical of mass models can be reproduced by a lorentz - violating model without mass .",
    "a variety of low - energy behavior is consistent with the same behavior at high energy .",
    "however , it remains difficult to explain all experiments , even with four free parameters .",
