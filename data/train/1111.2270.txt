    "@xcite and @xcite for relevant work in two - component and spinor condensates , respectively ) : such , so - called dark - bright ( db ) solitons exist due to the fact that the dark - soliton component creates , through the inter - species interaction , a trapping mechanism that allows the bright soliton component to be formed ( even though this is not possible in repulsive becs ) .",
    "dark - bright solitons have been studied extensively in other contexts , such as nonlinear optics @xcite and the theory of nonlinear waves @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have recently been analyzed in discrete settings @xcite , while higher - dimensional generalizations namely , vortex - bright - soliton structures were studied as well  @xcite .",
    "importantly , dark - bright solitons have been observed in experiments conducted both in optics @xcite and , more recently , in becs @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the interaction of solitons with localized impurities is a quite general and fundamental problem that has attracted much attention in the theory of nonlinear waves @xcite and solid state physics @xcite . in this context",

    "we study the statics and dynamics of solitons near the fixed points of the effective potential associated to the above mentioned equation of motion using both our analytical approach and numerical simulations .",
    "we also perform a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) analysis to investigate the excitation spectra of the db - solitons proper and study their stability .",
    "where appropriate , we find a very good agreement between the analytical predictions and the numerical findings , e.g. , the characteristic frequencies obtained by the equation of motion and the eigenfrequencies of the internal modes ( also known as `` anomalous modes '' @xcite ) associated with db - solitons .",
