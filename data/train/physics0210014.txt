    "there are several types of magnetic field sensors in common use . included",
    "are compass needles , hall probes , flux - gate magnetometers , and squids ( superconductive quantum interference devices ) .",
    "the compass needle was discovered @xmath4 years ago by the chinese .",
    "other types of sensors were developed relatively recently .",
    "the field of application of the different sensors clearly depends on the required accuracy , sensitivity , and expense .",
    "a compass needle is simple and does not require electric power or circuits but it indicates only the field direction .",
    "hall probes are more sophisticated devices which can measure fields over a large range of field strengths .",
    "they are simple to use , but have problems related to baseline drift and high sensitivity to ambient temperature changes , and they tend to have noisy signals .",
    "their typical resolution is @xmath5 , but with special precautions it can reach @xmath6 .",
    "flux - gate magnetometers are versatile and sensitive but require sophisticated signal processing which tends to limit the frequency band of their response",
    ". the most advanced type of magnetic field sensors are squids ( super - conductive quantum interference devices ) .",
    "these probes can measure magnetic fields with extremely high precision , but they require liquid nitrogen or liquid helium to operate and sophisticated electronics .",
    "that makes this type of probe expensive and limits its range of application .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a new type of inexpensive magnetic field sensor which is depicted in figure 1 . the sensor is a highly miniaturized version of the vibrating wire field measuring technique ( temnykh 1997 ) . in ",
    "2 we briefly consider the theory and in  3 we give the results of measurements on a model emr sensor . in ",
    "4 we give a summary .",
    "here we briefly consider properties of an elastic loop sketched in figure 2 .",
    "assume that both ends of the loop , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are fixed .",
    "a torque @xmath9 applied to the loop will cause it to tilt through an angle @xmath10 around horizontal @xmath11axis , where @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the shear modulus of the wire , @xmath14 the wire diameter , @xmath15 is the `` arm '' length indicated in figure 2 ( see for example brekhovskikh & goncharov 1993 ) . for copper @xmath16pa , with @xmath17 .",
    "consider now a dc current @xmath18 flowing through the loop .",
    "the lorentz force between the current in the loop and the vertical magnetic field @xmath19 gives a torque about the @xmath11axis approximately @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined in figure 2 . in the equilibrium , @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 the displacement of the upper point of loop in @xmath25direction is @xmath26 for the loop parameters indicated in the caption of figure 2 , and @xmath27 g ( used in the tests described below ) , we obtain @xmath28}{i[a ] } \\approx 0.294~.\\ ] ] the measured dependence discussed in  3.3 is @xmath29/i[{\\rm a } ] \\approx 0.35 $ ] .",
    "this is consistent with the analytic calculation if account is taken of the approximate equation ( 2 ) for the torque .",
    "the lowest frequency of vibration @xmath0 of the loop can be estimated as follows .",
    "the moment of inertia of the loop about the @xmath11axes is @xmath30\\rho_\\ell d^2 ~. \\label{inertia}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the density of the loop .",
    "thus the equation of motion for the free vibrations of the loop is @xmath32 the frequency of vibration is thus @xmath33^{-1/2}~. \\label{inertia}\\ ] ] for the loop dimensions shown in figure 2 and for the copper wire used ( @xmath34 ) , equation ( 8) gives @xmath35hz .",
    "this is consistent with the measured resonance frequency discussed in  3.2 , @xmath36 .",
    "the full equation of motion for the driven motion of the loop including the low reynolds number air friction is @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is given by equation ( 2 ) with the current @xmath39 a function of time , and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 kg/(m s ) the dynamic viscosity of air .",
    "also , for a long cylinder , @xmath42 ( landau & lifshitz 1959 ) , with @xmath43 euler s constant , with @xmath44 the peak velocity of the top of the loop , and with @xmath45 the kinematic viscosity of air . equation ( 9 ) implies that the quality factor for the vibrations is @xmath46 . for the displacement amplitudes discussed in  3.2 , the reynolds numbers @xmath47",
    "are indeed less than unity , and this formula gives the prediction @xmath48 which is larger than the measured value of @xmath49 (  3.2 ) .",
    "we believe that this difference is due to the approximations in the theory of the drag coefficient @xmath50 .",
    "we built a number of models of emr sensors .",
    "one of these are shown schematically in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the elastic element was fabricated from a @xmath51 mm diameter copper wire formed into a loop shape diagrammed in figure 2 .",
    "the fundamental mode of vibration corresponds to the top of the loop moving in the @xmath25direction in figure 2 . to measure position of the loop we used a `` @xmath52 '' shaped opto - electronic assembly h21a1 ( newark electronics ) consisting of a light - emitting - diode ( led ) on one leg of the assembly and a photo - transistor on other .",
    "the light flux detected by photo - transistor is very sensitive to loop position .    in the following",
    "we give the characteristics of the emr sensor components and results of the sensor tests .",
    "the opto - electronic detector was calibrated by the moving the entire loop using a precise micro - screw and measuring the signal from the photo - transistor .",
    "the measured dependence is shown in figure  [ detectorcalib ] .",
    "one can see that in the range @xmath53 mm the signal from photo - transistor is proportional to the loop displacement . @xmath54 } { \\delta   z[{\\rm mm } ] } = 421    \\label{calib}\\ ] ] here , @xmath55 is the change of the loop position , @xmath56 is the change in the detector signal .",
    "@xmath57 corresponds to a current @xmath58 through the external circuit resistor @xmath59 . in subsequent measurements ,",
    "the loop position was adjusted to be in the middle of the range of linear dependence .",
    "important characteristics of emr probe are the fundamental resonance frequency @xmath0 and the quality factor @xmath60 .",
    "we measured these parameters by driving an ac current with various frequencies through the element and measuring amplitude of the ac signal from photo - transistor . in figure  [ resonance ] the measured amplitude ( rms of ac voltage )",
    "is plotted as a function of frequency @xmath61 of the ac current .",
    "the data was fitted to the resonance formula @xmath62 where , @xmath0 is the resonance frequency , @xmath60 is the quality factor , and @xmath63 is a constant .",
    "this expression follows from equation ( 9 ) .",
    "the fit gave : @xmath64hz and @xmath65 .",
    "note that according to calibration  [ calib ] the maximum of @xmath66mv rms of ac signal seen at resonance on figure  [ resonance ] corresponds to @xmath67 mm of amplitude of vibration of the top of the loop .",
    "this small amplitude indicates that the optical detector was operating in the linear region of figure 3 . in this test",
    "the ac current amplitude trough the element was @xmath68ma and the magnetic field was @xmath69 g .",
    "this test was done to measure the static properties of the elastic element .",
    "a triangular ac current of low frequency of @xmath70hz was driven through the element .",
    "a @xmath71 g vertical magnetic field was imposed at the emr probe location by a permanent magnet .",
    "the lorentz force between the magnetic field and current flowing through the probe caused the loop displacement .",
    "figure  [ statdefla ] shows the current through the element , @xmath72 , and photo - transistor signal as a function of time .",
    "one can see the triangular wave current with @xmath73 period and photo - transistor signal with similar form . in figure  [ statdeflb ]",
    "the signal is plotted as function of current .",
    "the right - hand vertical scale shows the element displacement , @xmath74 , calculated from the signal by using calibration  [ calib ] .",
    "the data indicates a linear dependence of element displacement on current , @xmath28 } { \\delta i[{\\rm a } ] } \\approx   0.365~,\\ ] ] for the magnetic field of @xmath71 g .      in this test",
    "a hall probe was placed very close to the emr probe .",
    "the hall probe orientation was accurately adjusted so that it sensed only the vertical component of the magnetic field , which is the component which causes the vibration of elastic element in emr probe . a sinusoidal ac current of peak amplitude @xmath75ma at the resonance frequency @xmath76hz was driven through the element .",
    "the imposed magnetic field was created by a small permanent magnet .",
    "the field strength was varied by accurately moving the permanent magnet relative to the fixed probes .",
    "figure [ emrandhallreading ] shows the field measured by the hall probe and the signal from the emr sensor as a function of the test magnet position .",
    "the data shown in figure  [ emrandhallreading ] was used to calibrate the emr probe .",
    "figure  [ emrvshall ] shows a plot of the emr probe signal ( rms of ac voltage ) versus magnetic field strength measured with hall probe and fitted it with linear dependence .",
    "this fit gives @xmath77}{\\delta u_{ac}[{\\rm mv } ] } \\approx 0.0518~. \\label{emr_calibration}\\ ] ] that is , a @xmath70mv change of the emr probe signal indicates a @xmath78 mg change of the magnetic field strength .",
    "note that because the size of the test magnet was much smaller than the distance between probes and the magnet , the dependence of the magnetic field strength on the position @xmath79 can be approximated by @xmath80 here , @xmath81 is a parameter which represents either the background field or the @xmath82 drift for the hall probe .",
    "the parameter @xmath83 is proportional to the testing magnet magnetic moment , the parameter @xmath84 is set by the location of the probe in coordinate system used to define testing magnet position .",
    "the measurements with the hall and emr probes were fitted with the theoretical dependence  [ fit3 ] using @xmath81 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 as a free parameters .",
    "the residual between measured data and theoretical fit for both probes is shown in figure  [ emr_hall_comparison ] .    for the emr probe",
    "the difference ( measurement - fit ) was converted into magnetic field strength using equation ( [ emr_calibration ] ) .",
    "note that at each point , the signal from emr probe was measured several times .",
    "bars shown for the emr sensor data represent @xmath85 errors found from a statistical analysis of the measurements .",
    "we can now compare the difference between measurement and theoretical fit for the emr sensor and that for the hall probe . for hall probe rms",
    "the residual between measured data and theoretical fit is @xmath86 g , which is consists with the probe specifications . for our emr sensor",
    "the residual is @xmath87 g .",
    "that is , the emr sensor is 6 times better !",
    "in future refinements , an emr sensor element optimized for sensitivity can be developed .",
    "the geometry may be similar to that discussed above but the wire can be of diameter @xmath88 mm and consist of @xmath89 turns around the loop shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "scaling of our test results using equations (  [ displacement ] ) and ( [ inertia ] ) gives a sensitivity @xmath90 g , resonance frequency @xmath91hz , and a peak current amplitude @xmath92ma where the current was scaled @xmath93 .",
    "the elastic element can be vacuum encapsulated using nano - fabrication techniques . for vacuum conditions where the mean - free - path is longer than the dimensions of the loop ,",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath50 in equation ( 9 ) is proportional to the gas density or pressure .",
    "we estimate that the quality factor of the resonant element can be increased to @xmath94 .",
    "this increase in @xmath60 will increase the sensitivity by a factor @xmath95 . as a result",
    "the emr sensor can have a sensitivity of @xmath96 to @xmath97 g .",
    "this is a few orders of magnitude more sensitivity than a hall probe , but of course it is not as sensitive as squids .",
    "note that the measurement times at the lowest field levels need to be @xmath98min .",
