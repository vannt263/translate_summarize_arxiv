    "bill thurston introduces a construction for a class of pseudo - anosovs we call _ two - multiwist pseudo - anosovs_. he associates to each pair of filling multicurves in a surface the subgroup of the mapping class group generated by dehn twists around the multicurves , and shows that `` most of '' the elements of this group are pseudo - anosov .",
    "this construction is appealing in its simplicity and allows some invariants of pseudo - anosovs to be calculated more easily than in the general case .",
    "we review this construction in section 3 .    in the following section 4 ,",
    "we review an invariant @xmath0 of flat structures introduced by richard kenyon and john smillie in @xcite . since the thurston construction allows us to determine a flat structure preserved by a collection of pseudo - anosovs , within this class of pseudo - anosovs @xmath11 gives a useful commensurability invariant .",
    "chris leininger , in @xcite , studies the thurston construction to understand for which teichmller curves the associated stabilizers contain with finite index a group generated by two positive multi - twists . in section 5 we look at the invariants of some of these groups determining for some pairs @xmath12 of groups that no element of @xmath13 is commensurable with an element of @xmath14 .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we introduce a simple construction that produces many commensurabilities between different elements of different two - multitwist groups .",
    "the idea is to find covers that either lift or uniformly break multicurves , and to consider dehn twists in the covers .",
    "the author would like to thank his advisor genevieve walsh for asking the question that lead to this paper , for endless patience in listening to him discuss it , and for reading over early versions of it .",
    "the author would also like to thank dan margalit for leading him to the paper @xcite , and curt mcmullen for leading him to the paper @xcite .",

    "if @xmath15 is a compact surface , we will refer to the isotopy class @xmath16 $ ] of a homeomorphism @xmath17 of @xmath15 as an _ automorphism _ of @xmath15 .",
    "we will also refer to an automorphism by the pair @xmath18 .",
    "an automorphism @xmath19 _ covers _",
    "@xmath18 if there are a finite covering @xmath3 and @xmath10 and @xmath20 have representatives @xmath21 and @xmath17 such that @xmath22 .",
    "we then write @xmath23 or @xmath24",
    ".    automorphisms @xmath25 and @xmath26 are _ commensurable _ if there are an automorphism @xmath19 and nonzero integers @xmath7 such that @xmath27 covers @xmath28 and @xmath29 . if @xmath30 we say @xmath25 and @xmath26 are _ topologically commensurable _ and if @xmath31 we say they are _ dynamically commensurable_.    the relation of commensurability is of interest to 3-manifold theorists because if @xmath25 and @xmath26 are commensurable , the mapping tori associated to these automorphisms are 3-manifolds that admit a common finite - sheeted cover , that is , are commensurable as 3-manifolds @xcite",
    ". the especial interest of the pseudo - anosov case is that the interior of the mapping torus of @xmath18 is a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold that fibers over @xmath32 , by work of thurston @xcite    if we have a covering @xmath3 , the set of elements of @xmath33 that cover an element of @xmath34 under @xmath35 is a subgroup @xmath36 , and the covering relation is a homomorphism @xmath37 .",
    "this is because the covering relation @xmath38 distributes over composition , in the sense that if @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then @xmath41 i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "thus if we have two covering maps @xmath43 , the set of elements of @xmath33 that cover both through @xmath44 elements of @xmath45 and through @xmath46 elements of @xmath47 is a subgroup @xmath14 , and elements of @xmath48 are each commensurable with some element of @xmath49 .    associated with each @xmath18 , where @xmath20 is pseudo - anosov , are a number of invariants that are useful in detecting commensurability , as given in @xcite :    1 .",

    "let @xmath64 and @xmath65 be multicurves on a surface @xmath15 , and write @xmath66 for the mapping classes of the dehn multitwists around @xmath64 and @xmath65 . write @xmath67 for the subgroup @xmath68 of the mapping class group @xmath34 .",
    "we now , following @xcite , create a flat structure on @xmath15 depending on @xmath64 and @xmath65 . to do this ,",
    "we first create the _ dual cell decomposition _ @xmath69 of @xmath15 into rectangular cells , dual to the decomposition of @xmath15 determined by @xmath70 ; we then assign lengths to each rectangle in such a way that @xmath71 and @xmath72 act by affine transformations .    to get @xmath69 , draw a small rectangle in the surface at each intersection of an @xmath64 curve and a @xmath65 curve , with sides transverse to the curves .",
    "expand these rectangles until the surface is covered .",
    "after expansion , a rectangle at an intersection point @xmath35 of @xmath73 and @xmath74 will share a side with just the rectangles drawn around intersection points on @xmath73 and on @xmath74 that are adjacent to @xmath35 .",
    "thus rectangles are ultimately glued if they lie along the same curve and there are no intervening rectangles between them on the same curve .",
    "this is called the _ dual cell decomposition _",
    "@xmath75 to that determined by @xmath70 , and if the cell decomposition of @xmath15 determined by @xmath70 has @xmath76 vertices , @xmath77 edges , and @xmath78 faces , the dual decomposition has @xmath78 vertices , @xmath77 edges , and @xmath76 faces .",
    "for example , if @xmath70 does not separate @xmath15 , the cell decomposition has one face , so the dual cell decomposition will have one vertex . in general , one can show that if a face in the cell decomposition determined by @xmath70 is bounded by @xmath79 edges , the corresponding vertex in the dual cell decomposition will be an @xmath56-prong if the squares are foliated by lines parallel to the @xmath64 curves .",
    "the natural product foliations of the euclidean rectangles induce a pair of transverse singular foliations on @xmath15 ; the singularities are those vertices of the dual cell decomposition that are the result of identifying @xmath80 rectangle corners .",
    "call @xmath81 the infinite vector whose @xmath56th entry is the number of @xmath56-prongs of either foliation the entries of @xmath81 are intimately related with the genus @xmath82 of @xmath15 , by the hopf index theorem : if @xmath15 is closed , we have @xmath83 .",
    "thus if @xmath70 does not separate @xmath15 , we have @xmath84 , so @xmath85 ; that is , the single singularity of the foliation is a @xmath86-prong .        to illustrate the formation of the dual cell decomposition",
    ", we do an example . in part",
    "( a ) of the figure on the above , we have drawn a multicurve configuration @xmath87 filling a surface @xmath15 .",
    "we see that @xmath88 has two components .",
    "if we count the number of edges bounding the left region , we see there are 12 ( six in front , and another six on the side we ca nt see ) and 20 edges bounding the right one . in ( b ) , we draw squares , which we will grow to be faces of the dual decomposition @xmath69 , centered at the vertices @xmath89 .",
    "now there are six squares along the edges bounding the left region of the original cell decomposition .",
    "altogether , they have 24 corners , 12 of which lie in the left region , and 12 in the right .",
    "since the dual decomposition is to have one vertex corresponding to the left region , when we expand the squares to fill the surface , the left vertex will have a total angle of @xmath90 . since each separatrix has an angle of @xmath91 , then",
    ", the left vertex of @xmath69 will be a 6-prong .",
    "similarly , the right region contains @xmath92 square corners , so the right vertex of @xmath69 will be a 10-prong . in ( c ) , we move the centers of the squares in such a way that half of each square lies along the front of the surface , and half along the back , which we ca nt see . since the picture along the back is symmetrical , we can focus on the front , implicitly doing the same thing in the back .",
    "we expand the squares along the red curves until adjacent squares along the red curves have had their sides identified .",
    "we color the square corners that are to be identified to the left vertex in @xmath69 light green , and label them @xmath93 , and color those to be identified with the right one a darker fuchsia , and label them @xmath94 . in ( d ) , we make two side identifications of squares .",
    "there is one green corner left in the front of the picture , and three fuchsia ones , which are yet to be identified . in ( e ) , we identify these three fuchsia endpoints .",
    "this involves wrapping the edge with two fuchsia endpoints around the circle on the right with one fuchsia endpoint .",
    "once we ve done that , the picture has one fuchsia point in front and one in back , and one green point in front and one in back .",
    "the only sides of squares left unidentified are two outermost ones in the front and their mirror images in back , all parallel to the thick black border of the picture . in ( f ) , we drag these edges and vertices to the black border and identify them .",
    "this finally is the dual cell decomposition .    in order to assign lengths to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , associate a bipartite graph @xmath97 as follows . for each curve @xmath73 and @xmath74 create a vertex , and create one edge between @xmath73 and @xmath74 for each intersection .",
    "associated with this graph is @xmath98 , an @xmath99 incidence matrix whose @xmath100 entry is @xmath101 , the geometric intersection number of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "( or the number of edges between @xmath73 and @xmath74 in @xmath97 . )    assume the graph @xmath97 is connected ; then the square matrix @xmath102 has nonnegative integer entries , and some power of @xmath102 has strictly positive entries .",
    "it therefore has a _",
    "frobenius eigenvalue _",
    "@xcite : there is a unique positive real eigenvalue @xmath103 of multiplicity one and such that @xmath104 for all other eigenvalues @xmath105of @xmath102 .",

    "frobenius eigenvector for @xmath111 , since @xmath112 we complete the flat structure @xmath113 by giving each rectangle corresponding to an intersection of @xmath73 , considered as running horizontally and @xmath74 , considered as running vertically , the metric structure of the euclidean rectangle @xmath114 { \\times}[0,v_j]$ ] .    to see that the multitwists @xmath71 and @xmath72 act in an affine way on this structure , consider doing a dehn twist around the curve @xmath73 . the squares containing arcs of @xmath73 are the @xmath115 squares induced by intersections with curves @xmath74 .",
    "these squares are isometric to @xmath114 { \\times}[0,v_j]$ ] , so their union is a cylindrical neighborhood of @xmath73 with height @xmath116 and circumference @xmath117 putting coordinates in @xmath118 { \\times}[0,v_j]$ ] on this cylinder , doing a right - handed dehn twist on this cylinder takes @xmath119 .",
    "since this is the same on every cylinder , @xmath71 has derivative given everywhere by @xmath120 similarly , taking all the squares meeting @xmath74 gives a cylinder neighborhood with height @xmath121 and circumference @xmath122 and a dehn multitwist around @xmath65 ( right - handed ! ) gives an affine map with derivative @xmath123 .    by the chain rule ,",
    "then , an element @xmath17 of @xmath67 always has a derivative @xmath124 . since the matrices have determinant @xmath125 , the eigenvalues of @xmath124 multiply to @xmath125 .",
    "in fact , the eigenvalues of @xmath124 are given by @xmath126 , so the eigenvalues are complex conjugates , both @xmath127 , or real @xmath128 and inverse depending on whether the absolute value of the trace is less than , equal to , or greater than @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath124 has real eigenvalues , then invariant foliations for @xmath17 are given by the eigenvectors for @xmath124 , and leaves of these foliations are expanded and contracted by their corresponding eigenvalues @xmath130 .",

    "the middle one becomes a cylinder on cutting the blue curve , and cutting the remaining red arc makes it a disc .    to see that the glued together surface with the two curves is filled by the curves , again one first cuts along the blue curve .",
    "the red arcs endpoints on the boundary of the picture are now free to move around , so one can move them to the configuration below .",
    "now cutting along the red arc gives two triangular discs in the middle and genus - many `` handle''-shaped objects , which we saw before are actually disks .",
    "the techniques of the last section allow us to conclude that several accessible groups contain no commensurability classes of pseudo - anosovs in common .",
    "we are able , however , to construct some commensurable pseudo - anosovs in different @xmath67 .",
    "basically , the strategy is to lift dehn twists and use that @xmath38 is a homomorphism .",
    "we first adopt a strategy that yields compositions of twists covering other compositions of twists ; but these will not lie in two - multitwist groups @xmath67 . on seeing why this strategy does not yield a covering of elements of one @xmath67 group by another , a modification that does will become apparent .    in the picture",
    "below , we have a cyclic double cover @xmath440 ; the covering symmetry rotates @xmath441 counterclockwise by an angle of @xmath91 around the axis extending vertically through the middle handle .",
    "put another way , to get @xmath441 from @xmath15 , cut along @xmath442 , clone the resulting doubly - punctured torus , and glue the two cut objects together along their boundaries in such a way that the resulting action of @xmath443 is free ..        we draw multicurves @xmath87 in an @xmath275 configuration on @xmath15 .",
    "note that the curves @xmath444 , @xmath445 , and @xmath446 lift to two pairs of curves each on @xmath441 , but @xmath447 lifts to a pair of paths since it is cut by @xmath442 .",

    "the lengths of curves the corresponding flat structures , however , are not the same , ( this shows up in the noncommensurability of the different @xmath0 ) and we have seen therefore that none of the pseudo - anosovs in @xmath67 lift to elements of @xmath453 .",
    "we can find some compositions of dehn twists in curves of @xmath64 and @xmath65 that do lift to @xmath453 , but these will not be elements of @xmath67 .",
    "later , we will find a different cover and multicurves @xmath454 such that elements of @xmath67 do lift to elements of @xmath455 .",
    "as far as the present cover is concerned , we claim the dehn multitwist @xmath456 covers the twist @xmath457 .",
    "consider a small annular neighborhood @xmath461 of @xmath64 , and give @xmath462 { \\times}s^1 $ ] coordinates @xmath463 .",
    "the inverse image @xmath464 is a disjoint union of @xmath56 annuli @xmath465 , each homeomorphic to @xmath461 , around @xmath466 .",
    "we can assume the twist @xmath467 to be supported on @xmath461 , where can be written in local coordinates as @xmath468 .",
    "we can pull back these coordinates to coordinates @xmath469 on @xmath465 and @xmath470 can be taken to be supported on these annuli with local formulas @xmath471 .",
    "now if @xmath472 we have @xmath473 so @xmath474 on the complement @xmath475 of the lifted annuli , the multitwist @xmath476 is the identity , as is @xmath71 on @xmath477 , so we have @xmath478 there as well .",
    "thus @xmath476 covers @xmath467 .",
    "given an @xmath56-fold covering of surfaces @xmath458 , suppose a curve @xmath64 in @xmath15 lifts to @xmath485 curves @xmath486 in @xmath195 , with @xmath487 an @xmath488-to-@xmath125 map .",

    "take @xmath461 to be an annulus around @xmath64 and @xmath465 to be the component of @xmath491 containing @xmath466 . restricting to these annuli",
    ", it will be enough to show that @xmath492 on @xmath465 .",
    "if @xmath64 has coordinates @xmath493 { \\times}[0,2\\pi)$ ] as before , the lift @xmath494 is @xmath488 rectangular neighborhoods with these coordinates , attached end to end , so they naturally carry coordinates @xmath495 { \\times}[0,2 n_j\\pi)$ ] .",
    "the point @xmath496 has the @xmath488 lifts @xmath497 upstairs , @xmath498 so the @xmath488-fold covering @xmath499 can be represented by taking the second coordinate modulo @xmath428 . now we can take @xmath500 , and projecting down , @xmath501    now using that @xmath38 is a homomorphism , we see @xmath502 and @xmath503 .",
    "thus we have an element - by - element covering @xmath504 .",
    "however , the latter group intersects @xmath67 in @xmath145 , so they share no pseudo - anosovs .",
    "we now see why in this example elements of @xmath67 do nt lift to elements of @xmath453 : the problem is exactly that the exponents of @xmath482 and @xmath505 are not the same in the image . in order to fix this",

    "so consider the two - fold covering below .",

    "join the lifts of @xmath446 to form a curve @xmath506 double - covering @xmath446 and similarly form a curve @xmath507 double - covering @xmath447 .",
    "now @xmath508 for @xmath509 , so if we let @xmath510 be the set of lifts of @xmath511 and @xmath512 , then @xmath513 and @xmath514 , so @xmath515 .",
    "there is nothing special about double covers in this example ; forming an @xmath56-fold cover of @xmath15 by cutting along @xmath442 and gluing @xmath56 copies cyclically gives a configuration @xmath516 of curves in the cover @xmath517 such that @xmath518 .    in this way we get",
    "an infinite family of cyclic covers @xmath519 ; moreover , the cover @xmath520 always factors both through @xmath521 and @xmath517 : + the curve systems are compatible with the coverings , so that the group @xmath522 in @xmath523 covers the subgroup @xmath524 of @xmath525 under the covering map @xmath526 .",
    "this shows that the elements in the group @xmath527 are all commensurable with elements of the group @xmath528 of @xmath529 .",
    "the transpose of the incidence matrix for the upstairs configuration is @xmath530 , so that @xmath531 has characteristic polynomial @xmath532 and perron  frobenius eigenvalue @xmath533 .",
    "thus in the derivative representation @xmath534 we have @xmath535 and @xmath536 .",
    "the `` natural choice '' of width assignment for rectangles upstairs is to glue together @xmath56 copies of the flat structure we ve chosen for the surface below : namely , to give lifts of @xmath444 the width @xmath125 and lifts of @xmath445 the width @xmath537 , the golden ratio , @xmath538 the width @xmath537 , and @xmath539 the width @xmath125 .",
