    "electron bunch trains with sub - picosecond structures have applications ranging from the generation of super - radiant radiation  @xcite to the resonant excitation of wakefields in beam - driven accelerating techniques  @xcite .",
    "several techniques to obtain such bunch trains are developed in recent years , such as placing an interceptive mask in a dispersive section  @xcite .",
    "our method consists introducing a horizontal beam density modulation , then exchanging the beam transverse and longitudinal phase - space , and finally recovering the density modulation in time and energy profile  @xcite .",
    "the phase - space exchange beamline is composed of one dipole - mode rf cavity flanked by two identical doglegs , each dogleg formed by two dipole magnets ( henceforth referred to as the double - dogleg beamline )  @xcite . under the thin lens approximation and phase - space exchange conditions  @xcite ,",
    "the beam phase - space final longitudinal coordinates @xmath0 are related to the initial horizontal coordinates @xmath1 via @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the bending angle of the dipole magnets , @xmath4 is the drift space between the dipoles in a dogleg , and @xmath5 is the drift space between the middle dipole magnets and the dipole - mode cavity .",
    "the coupling described by eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be used to arbitrarily shape the temporal distribution of an electron beam  @xcite including tunable bunch trains with sub - picosecond temporal structure , which have been experimentally demonstrated in our experiment at the a0 photoinjector  @xcite .",
    "the experiment of generating sub - picosecond electron bunch trains is carried out at the fermilab a0 photoinjector .",
    "the electron beam is photo - emitted from a cesium telluride cathode , accelerated by a 1.3  ghz 1.5-cell rf gun and a 9-cell superconducting cavity , reaching an energy of 14  mev for our experiment reported here .",
    "downstream of the accelerating cavity , the beamline includes a set of quadrupole and steering dipole magnets , and diagnostic stations for transverse emittance measurements before splitting into two beamlines ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : a0beamline ] .",
    "the `` straight - ahead '' beamline is used for transverse and longitudinal beam parameter diagnostics , while the `` double - dogleg '' beamline for phase - space exchange between horizontal and longitudinal phase - spaces  @xcite .",
    "a tungsten multi - slits plate is inserted at x3 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : a0beamline ] ) .",
    "the horizontal density of the electron beam is modulated into vertical beamlets downstream of the slits . a couple of quadrupoles ( q1 and q2 in fig .  [ fig : a0beamline ] )",
    "are used to tune the transverse courant - synder parameters of the beam prior to the double - dogleg beamline , which provide us the controlling knobs for the time structure of the bunch train after the phase - space exchange .",
    "downstream of the double - dogleg beamline , an aluminium screen can be inserted at x24 .",
    "coherent transition radiation ( ctr ) is generated as the beam impinges on the screen .",
    "an optical path directs the ctr through the vacuum window and an michelson autocorrelator .",
    "the intensity of the autocorrelation function is detected by a liquid helium - cooled bolometer .    keeping the current of quadrupole q2 fixed at -0.6  a",
    ", we scan the current of q1 from 1.0  a to 1.8  a. the autocorrelation functions measured by the bolometer are shown in fig.[fig : time ] .",
    "the 100% modulation of the autocorrelation function implies that the bunches within the train are completely separated .",
    "the bunch train separation is extracted from the measured autocorrelation function .",
    "the minimum measured separation is 350  @xmath6 m . assuming the bunches are gaussian longitudinally , the estimated rms bunch length is less than 300  fs ( which includes the  200  fs resolution of our measurement system ) .",
    "the separation between two neighboring peaks is almost doubled as @xmath7 increased from 1.0  a to 1.8  a ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : time2 ] .",
    "this demonstrates the tunability of the technique used here to generate sub - ps electron bunch trains .",
    "the successful demonstration of the generation of tunable sub - ps electron trains at the a0 photoinjector is very encouraging . as the a0 photoinjector is expected to cease operation at the end of the fy2011 , and part of the beamline is going to be incorporated into the beamline of the fermilab srf accelerator test facility(atf ) , a superconducting linear electron accelerator currently under construction in the nml building  @xcite .",
    "the injector of the atf ( henceforth referred to as the nml photoinjector ) consists of a co - axial 1.3 ghz rf photocathode gun , followed by two tesla - type 9-cell sc rf accelerating cavities and a 3rd harmonic sc rf cavity .",
    "the beam energy of the nml injector is around 40  mev , and the bunch charge is variable up to 3.2  nc .",
    "a transverse - to - longitudinal phase - space exchange beamline that is similar to the a0 beamline is available downstream of the injector ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : nmlbeamline ] . the dipole magnets in each dogleg",
    "is separated by @xmath4=1.07  m , and the distance @xmath5 between to two center dipoles is 1.99  m. each dipole bends the beam by 22.5@xmath8 while each dogleg generates a dispersion of 44  cm .",
    ".[tab : initpara]initial beam parameters used in gpt simulation before phase - space exchange . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the simulations",
    "are performed using gpt  @xcite with 3d space charge force on .",
    "initial beam parameters are gathered in table  [ tab : initpara ] .",
    "a mask with vertical slits of width @xmath9 and separation @xmath10 intercepts the beam upstream of the quadrupole triplet in front of the double - dogleg beamline ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nmlbeamline ] ) .",
    "the beam horizontal density is modulated by the slits , as seen in the snapshot of @xmath11-@xmath12 configuration - space shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xslits ] , where @xmath11 is the horizontal position and @xmath12 the time within the beam .",
    "while the bunch charge is 250  pc before the slits , only 25% of the electrons are transmitted through the slits for the two slit - configurations reported in this paper ( 30  @xmath13m - wide slits separated by 120  @xmath6 m , and 20  @xmath6m - wide slits separated by 80@xmath13 m ) .",
    "the optimization parameters for phase - space exchange and bunch train generation include the gradient and phase of the deflecting cavity , initial beam energy chirp and transverse courant - synder parameters upstream of the double - dogleg beamline .",
    "the bunch train temporal structure can be tuned by using different slit configurations and/or varing the quadrupole strengths prior to phase - space exchange .",
    "the initial horizontal modulation is mapped into longitudinal coordinates ( time and energy ) via eq .",
    "( [ eq : xzmap ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zslits ] , we see that the initial modulations existed in @xmath11-axis is mapped into @xmath12-axis , thus a bunch train with sub - picosecond temporal structure is generated .",
    "given the double - dog beamline as designed in the nml photoinjector , bunch trains separated by 560  fs and 470  fs are achieved using slits separated by 120@xmath6 m and 80@xmath6 m , respectively ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : simu1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : simu2 ] . in each case , the quadrupoles upstream are tuned to obtain completely separated bunches in the train with minimal separations .",
    "compared with the experimental demonstration at a0 photoinjector , the bunch train separations obtained in these simulations are reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "the advantage of the nml photoinjector beam is its smaller initial horizontal emittance , but a disadvantage is that distance @xmath5 between the two center dipoles is 1/3 longer than the case of a0 . as the initial beam is only modulated in @xmath11-position and not in the @xmath14 divergence , and contribution of the divergence of @xmath14 to the final @xmath12",
    "is linearly proportional to @xmath5  @xcite , a larger @xmath5 means more dilution of the bunch train structure at the end of the phase - space exchange .",
    "we have experimentally demonstrated electron bunch trains separated by as low as 350  @xmath6 m at the a0 photoinjector . using a vertical multi - slit plate with smaller slit width and separation ,",
    "more closely spaced bunch trains can be achieved in numerical simulations , as better beam emittance at 250  pc is expected at the nml injector .",
    "the fabrication of such multi - slit plates might be a challenge , but reducing the separation between the two center dipole magnets in the nml beamline can relieve the pressure on the requirement of slit separations .",
    "future research on slits fabrication and double - dogleg beamline arrangement will be pursued .",
